0,bkoganbing,Death coming from nowhere,5,20 February 2016,"Although no evidence that American Indians in the lower 48 has ever been involved with cannibalism has ever been offered that didn't stop the making of this horror/western. Bone Tomahawk stars Kurt Russell a little older and grayer than he was when he was starring as Wyatt Earp in Tombstone brought a little of that character to this role of a small town sheriff who leads a rescue posse for Lili Simmons who's been abducted by a tribe of cannibal Indians who dwell in the rock caves of the American Southwest.Maybe back in the days they could have been considered a tribe, but they seem to have been reduced to a cult of some kind. There also doesn't seem to be any women among these Indians so I'm sure that Simmons was not abducted to be a main course. They are a frightening bunch painted white as they are with death from their arrows and knives coming out of nowhere.I'm still at a loss why Kurt Russell didn't send for the cavalry as this was their thing, but instead takes Patrick Wilson who is Lili's husband, his deputy Richard Jenkins, and Matthew Fox a most civilized sort of gentleman who gets some peculiar jollies. Wounded and decimated as they are and drugged with a peculiar anesthetic that allows the Indians to snack on live victims the guys give it their best shot.Bone Tomahawk seems to have acquired a cult status judging by the other commentary here. It's certainly not for the squeamish.",Bone Tomahawk
1,Leofwine_draca,Gritty western/horror hybrid really delivers the goods,10,15 April 2017,"BONE TOMAHAWK is a really good western/horror movie that features exemplary direction from an unknown director and great performances from the small cast. It terms of plot it's nothing special, a 19th century reworking of THE HILLS HAVE EYES, but it's the execution that makes this such a great movie. Despite a two and a quarter hour running time the film is hugely suspenseful and soaked in a gritty, disturbing atmosphere.I'd heard reports of this being a gore fest but it's no such thing; there are a handful of brutal moments but mainly this is a mood piece. The descent into a kind of hell is reminiscent of the likes of APOCALYPSE NOW and CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST and the every scene is carefully composed to add maximum depth and tension. The desert landscapes look fantastic, and the violence is all the more impactful for being used sparingly.Cast-wise, Kurt Russell headlines the show and is quite brilliant, as usual; it's nice to see him being used properly after his turn in the lacklustre HATEFUL EIGHT (and boy, Tarantino could sure learn a thing or two from this film). Patrick Wilson does his dedicated everyman performance and is likable with it, and Matthew Fox is a real surprise as the brash and arrogant fellow who gets you on side regardless. Richard Jenkins, as the old timer, somehow keeps the whole thing together. As with the recent MAGNIFICENT SEVEN remake, BONE TOMAHAWK breathes new life into the almost forgotten western genre, making it worthy once more. I can't wait to watch it again.",Bone Tomahawk
2,SnoopyStyle,slower horror western with brutal violence,7,9 March 2017,"Purvis (David Arquette) and Buddy (Sid Haig) are bandits killing and robbing in the old west. They stumble upon a native site and Buddy is killed by a warrior. Purvis escapes to the town of Bright Hope. Sheriff Franklin Hunt (Kurt Russell) confronts and wounds him. The town is attacked in the dead of night and people go missing. The locals suspect a clan of cannibalistic native cave-dwellers. Hunt leads John Brooder (Matthew Fox), hobbled Arthur O'Dwyer (Patrick Wilson) looking for his taken wife Samantha (Lili Simmons), and deputy Chicory (Richard Jenkins) as a posse of four.The start is a very intriguing horror western. Then it turns into a slower paced affair. The intensity is lowered but it maintains the interest. The characters are good played by compelling actors. There are some brutal violence although sometimes the camera cuts before the coup de gras. With some of the crazy violence, it's weird that the film does the old fashion look-away. The last act is unforgettable.",Bone Tomahawk
3,Prismark10,Bone Tomahawk,6,11 March 2020,"If you want bone crunching visceral violence, Bone Tomahawk is for you.The early scenes set its stall out as one robber is cutting the throat of a man he is robbing. The casting of Sid Haig will inform you that this is a grindhouse western.In a small frontier town. A wounded criminal has been arrested for desecrating an Indian burial ground. A cannibalistic clan of troglodytes descend on the town and take him as well as the female doctor who was treating him.The Sheriff (Kurt Russell) his grizzled deputy (Richard Jenkins), the doctor's injured husband (Patrick Wilson) and a seasoned Indian killer (Matthew Fox) form a rescue posse.After the opening scenes, the pace slows to a more slow burn western, some of the dialogue comes close to being banal. Fox used to fancy Wilson's wife which puts them at loggerheads.Once they approach the clan's hideout, it becomes less of a western and more of a horror show as the movie switches genre. Some of the characters have a very high pain threshold.",Bone Tomahawk
4,nogodnomasters,Smart men don't get married,7,23 March 2018,"This is an odd ""western"" which is more like a 19th century, ""These Hills Have Eyes."" An outlaw disturbs a sacred site of a group of isolated cannibal Native Americans. This brings trouble to the town of Bight Hope which results in a rescue party attempt into the home of the ""Troglodyte"" cave dwellers who would ""rape and eat their own mothers.""This is a slightly different plot for a western, however it is just a different setting for a horror/slasher film without much horror. The film starts off by capturing your interest. It builds character, then slows, then hits you again. Then if drags (literally as one guy has a broken leg) as we spend too much time of our rescue group going after the cannibals.Guide: sex and brief nudity.",Bone Tomahawk
5,kosmasp,Slow Burning Western,8,18 May 2019,"So while I am eagerly awaiting to watch the newest or most current movie the director has made (Dragged across concrete), I#ll pass the time reviewing this one. Now Western movies are a genre that are not for everyone to begin with. But if you love them, you will know there are different kinds of Western movies out there, depicting ""cowboys"" in different ways and being either idolizing or breaking down myths.Now this is a different beast, because it adds occult and fantasy into the mix. It also is quite violent. So not something for the squeamish. If you can stomach whatever it is you are getting served, than you will get a movie with some stunning cinematography and great acting. Just because there is action though does not mean, this goes by in a snap. It actually might feel like it is dragging (no pun intended). But the slow pace juxtoposes the violence in a really efficient way and give us the viewer a bit of room to breathe ... also the characters involved in this. Realistic if you discount the otherworldly/spiritual themes and heavy ... also quite amazing",Bone Tomahawk
6,classicsoncall,"""You shouldn't call for the Lord's attention right now.""",9,2 April 2016,"If there's such a movie genre as horror Western, this one might be at the top of the list. Released in 2015, I only became aware of the film by pulling up an internet site touting 'The Best 25 Westerns of the Last 25 Years'. (""Slow West"" was on the same list, you might give that one a try too). The picture grabs you pretty quickly when Sid Haig's (didn't know he was still around either) character gets used for target practice in an opening sequence; from there on it becomes an intense journey in search of a woman and deputy sheriff kidnapped by a most unexpected tribe of cannibalistic cave dwelling troglodytes. Personally, I was thrown off guard by the use of the word 'troglodyte' in a Western, so that would have been hook number two. The eerie howling wind scream completed the trilogy.After it's over I think most viewers won't have any trouble realizing that the story doesn't stand up against the harsh daylight of reality. But while it's under way the picture grabs you in a visceral way and it's hard to let go. Some will complain that it's a slow picture with the amount of time spent on the trail with the four members that make up the posse, but this is where first time director S. Craig Zahler gets some of the best dialog from his characters. It's my official opinion that the backup deputy Chicory (Richard Jenkins) initiated one of the strangest, yet most comical conversations in the history of Westerns when he expounded on the difficulty of reading in a bathtub. Even weirder was Sheriff Hunt's (Kurt Russell) helpful suggestions on how to make the experience more palatable. I mean that was just classic.Now if you're watching with a critical eye, some things won't pass muster. Living as virtual scavengers, a couple of the cave dwellers didn't look exactly undernourished. The one that got the toe trim from the sheriff physically looked like a monster. The biggest strain on the story's credibility for me was the lack of emotion from Samantha O'Dwyer (Lili Simmons), the kidnapped wife we see imprisoned in the troglodyte cave once the sheriff and Chicory are captured. You would think she would have suffered some physical and emotional trauma by this time but it seemed like just another day in the park for her. She didn't even seem to be that much moved by the Hannibal Lechter job done on deputy Nick (Evan Jonigkeit), just prior to using him for a wishbone. God, that was the sickest thing I think, that I've ever seen in a movie, but then again, I intentionally stay away from chainsaw massacre and 'Saw' flicks for just that reason.Forty years ago a film came out called ""The Missouri Breaks"" with Marlon Brando and Jack Nicholson, and I recall thinking to myself after watching it, that this was not your father's Western. Anyone of the current generation catching this one will more than likely be led to the same conclusion, although if any of my adult offspring run across this review, let it be known I watched it anyway.",Bone Tomahawk
7,Tweekums,Cannibals in the Old West,8,13 February 2019,"As this film opens a pair of murderous thieves bushwhack two men as they sleep; hearing approaching horses they flee to a remote valley where one of them is killed by members of a tribe of cannibalistic troglodytes. The other escapes to the town of Bright Hope, where he is arrested. During the course of his arrest he is shot in the leg and Samantha O'Dwyer is called to tend for him. That night the savages raid the town; stealing horses, killing a stable boy and taking everybody in the town jail... Mrs O'Dwyer, the deputy and the prisoner. The next day an unlikely foursome set out to rescue them; Sheriff Franklin Hunt; his elderly Deputy 'Chicory' Kory; gunslinger John Brooder; and Arthur O'Dwyer, Samantha's husband who insists on accompanying them despite having a broken leg following an accident. The journey will be tough and they will face a variety of adversities before they ultimately reach the savages in the 'Valley of the Starving Men'... then they will face their greatest danger yet.For the most part this is a classic western in the mould of 'The Searchers' with settlers trying to retrieve kidnapped people. The early part of the film does a fine job of introducing the key characters without telling us too much about the cannibal tribe. The journey section goes through impressive scenery which creates a good feeling of their distance from any potential help. When they get to their destination the sense of tension increases significantly. Some of what we then see wouldn't be out of place in a horror movie; this includes some very disturbing sights. The cast does a fine job; notably the four leads Kurt Russell as the Sheriff; Patrick Wilson as Arthur O'Dwyer; Richard Jenkins 'Chicory'; and Matthew Fox as John Brooder. Lili Simmons impresses as Samantha O'Dwyer although her role is smaller. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of westerns who also like horror films... or vice versa even though it is more western than horror.",Bone Tomahawk
8,BA_Harrison,Cowboys and cannibals.,7,15 November 2015,"Injured cowboy Arthur O'Dwyer (Patrick Wilson) joins a rescue party after discovering that his wife Samantha (Lili Simmons) is one of a group of people who have been abducted by a tribe of savage cave dwellers. When Sheriff Franklin Hunt (Kurt Russell), vengeful gunslinger John Brooder (Matthew Fox) and back-up deputy Chicory (Richard Jenkins) are surprised by the savages, Arthur, who has been lagging behind, must face the enemy alone.John Ford's The Searchers is given a cannibalistic twist in this unusual fusion of horror and western from writer and first-time director S. Craig Zahler. Told at an extremely measured pace and primarily driven by characterisation, Bone Tomahawk might prove an arduous journey for those who demand constant action and thrills, especially with the film clocking in at a whopping 132 minutes; others, however, should find that the engaging performances from the male leads, Zahler's wry dialogue and the occasional moment of extreme violence compensate adequately for the languorous approach.",Bone Tomahawk
9,hitchcockthelegend,It's sure to be a bone of contention...,9,14 February 2016,"Written and directed by S. Craig Zahler, Bone Tomahawk stars Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox, Richard Jenkins and Lili Simmons. Music is by Zahler and Jeff Herriott and cinematography by Benji Bakshi.Ah, yes, the horror western hybrid, a most difficult thing to get right at the best of times, even harder to entice newcomers to the sub- genre splice if they don't particularly like horror or westerns! This is a tough sell, a pic of startling originality, but of homage worthiness as well, that it kind of feels like a film made for a secret society of film fans. A society perhaps like the Troglodyte tribe who dominate the horror aspect of this particular tale.Plot is set in the wild west, where after a set of circumstances leads to the kidnapping of three people from the local jail - by members of the Troglodyte tribe, four men set off on a rescue mission...How splendid to find a narrative that isn't afraid to nod towards one of the most revered westerns of all time, yet be its own entity at the same time. Bone Tomahawk will polarise opinions, no question about it, the whole middle section involves a travelogue pumped by characterisations and a need to set the stage for what will occur in the final third. However, to even think that the four horsemen of the apocalypse bulk of this movie is mere slow time cinema is unfair, for dark comedy is at work - a racist horse? Surely not? So the screenplay not only sparkles with wit, but it also pulses with drama, drama that comes from human stubbornness. Be it men who know that no matter what will happen, they will maybe die in honour due to mistakes or mismanagement, or just a matter of redemption, this mission on the surface seems pure folly, but in reality there is more at work here. And thus comes the horror, characters have been well formed, we know them and are interested in what will happen to them. Like or dislike is irrelevant, we bloody know them, so as the film hits its raging ""B"" movie straps, shouting at the screen or wincing in harmony becomes a requisite. As is squirming...Intricately paced, beautifully photographed and splendidly performed by a top cast who aren't interested in top billing or walk of fame recognition, Bone Tomahawk is a grade ""A"" culter. Zahler could be someone to keep an eye on. 9/10",Bone Tomahawk
10,Theo Robertson,Impressive Western With Horror Elements,8,11 April 2017,"Kurt Russell ? Whatever happened to him. He was a fixture in cinema releases from the 1980s and early 1990s then seemed to disappear quite quickly from the scene. His stardom was probably down to the fact that he could play edgy anti-heroes in stuff like THE THING or good ole American boys in films like BACKDRAFT. He was definitely much more versatile than action heroes from the 80s like Sly and Arnie and after seeing THE HATEFUL EIGHT I'd forgotten how good Russell was back in the day. Mentioning Tarantino's movie I came in to BONE TOMAHAWK, a film described as cross genre involving horror set against a Western background, I thought I might be watching a post modernist mess full of smart alec dialogue and nodding self referential winks to the camera. Thankfully this is not what I got Just before I started watching I came on to the box office and business subsection of this page to find it cost $1.8 million. This is a sum that wouldn't get a big name star in Hollywood to answer a bedside phone-call never mind appear in a movie and yet director/screenwriter S Craig Zahler has made a film that riveted me far more than the average blockbuster which costs 50 times more than this one did. This is even more surprising because I dislike Westerns and can take or leave horror movies and yet the fusion here impressed me greatly The reason BONE TOMAHAWK works so well is because it starts off so very low key and languid and the pace , tension and horror is slowly ratcheted up. It's similar in many ways to APOCALYPSE NOW that started off as a macho war film then ended up being a psychedelic expressionist horror film set in another dimension. Now to be fair BONE TOMAHAWK is in no way visually stunning compared to the Coppola masterwork. Instead it's if not realist type cinema then undeniably independent cinema composed for the most part of four men riding through a Western landscape. Admittedly there's almost zero horror element until the final third but that's the whole point of the film and when the horror does happen there's more than enough violence to satisfy the most blood thirsty gore hound Interestingly another cross genre horror film that has come out recently was the British production UNDER THE SHADOW set during the Iran Iraq war of the 1980s. Structure wise it shares a structural similarity with this where the drama is the focus and the horror elements are held back to the end and one wonders if up and coming producers might wish to use this technique more often ? I also wonder why producers are spending 100 million dollars on movies that are very mediocre to say the least. BONE TOMAHAWK thankfully bucks this trend",Bone Tomahawk
11,Hey_Sweden,It's the opinion of the backup deputy that this movie rocks.,8,23 May 2016,"One night, a crazed ""drifter"", Purvis (David Arquette), comes to the small town of Bright Hope, and causes enough of a problem to be shot by Sheriff Hunt (Kurt Russell) and taken to jail. While local doctor Samantha (Lili Simmons) tends to his gunshot wound, mysterious forces come by during the night and abduct *everybody* in the police station. The Sheriff forms a posse with three other men: his backup deputy Chicory (Richard Jenkins), local character Brooder (Matthew Fox), and Samanthas' husband Arthur (Patrick Wilson), who crippled himself in an accident. Their journey takes them a few days until they come upon the enemy: a strange, and especially savage, tribe of Indian so obscure that they don't even have a name.There's a fair bit here that's predictable, but obviously reinventing the horror and Western genres is not debuting writer / director S. Craig Zahlers' primary aim. It must be said that his film is not going to be for all tastes, as more timid viewers will be extremely put off by the violence and gore. But those with strong stomachs will find this to be a very robust entertainment, extremely well shot in widescreen by Benji Bakshi. Zahler is deliberate and definitely takes his time telling his story, which may cause him to lose some more viewers. However, ""Bone Tomahawk"" is remarkable for not only delivering in a very visceral way, but also truly caring about its characters. You want to stick with these people and see how their tale develops. Even Brooder, who comes off as a real prick for a while, does eventually emerge as a man you can understand.Zahler also composed the music score along with Jeff Herriott, and it perfectly supplements this film that takes us on a vivid journey, one that memorably captures a sense of real desolation.Kurt, sporting some awe inspiring facial hair, is solid as a rock as the lawman. Wilson is equally fine, and the supporting cast features familiar faces such as Sid Haig, Fred Melamed, James Tolkan, Kathryn Morris, Michael Pare, Sean Young, and Jamison Newlander. Even Fox isn't bad. But Jenkins offers the wonderful standout performance here. He is the heart and soul of this picture.Zahlers' script has some very good dialogue, and one memorable laugh when Samantha offers up her opinion on why frontier life is so difficult.Finally, the villains here are incredibly creepy once properly revealed. They barely qualify as human, and have a particular kind of vocalization that makes your skin crawl.Long in duration (at two hours and 12 minutes), but worth sticking with.Eight out of 10.",Bone Tomahawk
12,LeonLouisRicci,"""It's the Official Opinion of the Backup Deputy""...This One Worth a Watch",8,2 February 2016,"Strong and Literate Dialog and a Determined Offbeat Delivery, combined with some Gut-Wrenching Horror, makes this one of the most Controversial Movies of the Year.

A Movie that should Come with a Warning to Western Movie Fans that may be Taken-a-Back with the Gore. This is the probably the most Off-Beat Western since Jodorowsky's El Topo (1970).

13,zardoz-13,One Savage Cannibal Western!!!,7,16 April 2016,"Writer & director S. Craig Zahler's ""Bone Tomahawk"" doesn't rank as a great western, but it is certainly a solid but unsavory entry in the genre. Not only does this lumbering horse opera benefit from a top-notch cast, including Kurt Russell, Matthew Fox, Richard Jenkins, Patrick Wilson, David Arquette, Sid Haig, Sean Young, Michael Pare, and James Tolkan, but it also has some of the scariest adversaries. The Indians from any other western cannot possibly compare with these dastards. Indeed, ""Bone Tomahawk"" could be classified as a hybrid western with horror elements. Essentially, what takes place in this oater is combination of the John Ford movie ""The Searchers"" and any of Italian cannibal movies from the late 1970s and the 198os, such as ""Cannibal Ferox,"" ""Eaten Alive,"" ""Jungle Holocaust. The plot concerns a group of cave dwelling Indians who go on the warpath about a couple of murderous thieves, Buddy (Sid Haig) and Purvis (David Arquette), after they stumble onto a secret Indian burial ground and desecrate it. Buddy suffers the wrath of these godless, heathen troglodytes who are as savage as they are ruthless. Later, you'll have muster your nerve to get through the scene where they kill one of Sheriff Hunt's deputies is slaughtered before their eyes and then split in two! After the troglodytes—think Indians covered in dried mud—kill the first thief, they slip into the western frontier town of Bright Hope, track down the second thief to Sheriff Hunt's jail where they kidnap a female nurse Samantha (Lili Simmons of ""Fat Kid Rules the World""), Purvis, and Hunt's younger deputy Nick (Evan Jonigkeit of Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"") to their faraway cave in the mountains. Naturally, Samantha's husband Arthur (Patrick Wilson of ""Watchmen"") sets off in pursuit with Sheriff Hunt (Kurt Russell of ""Big Trouble in Little China""), Hunt's deputy Chicory (Richard Jenkins of ""Step Brothers""), and one of Samantha's former suitors Brooder (Matthew Fox of ""Emperor""). Poor Arthur has a game leg and spends part of his time limping through some of the worst terrain on a crutch with his torn up leg in danger of developing gangrene. The Indians wield arrows as well as jawbones of what appear to be horses. They devastate their victims. The suspense at time is unbearable, especially when they drag out Sheriff Hunt and slash his belly open. Things are really creepy toward the end when the survivors pass a couple of Indian pregnant Indian women whose legs have been chopped off and their eyes plugged with with sticks. Richard Jenkins has some amusing moments as Hunt's older deputy who learns about the truth behind flea circuses. The dialogue is strong but not quotable. Nothing about this grim western could be described as glamorous. Everybody goes through utter Hell to accomplish their goals. The scenes involving our heroes as they contend with the formidable hostiles are splendidly staged with the stunt guys doing a spectacular job of dying. You've never seen a western like ""Bone Tomahawk.""",Bone Tomahawk
14,grantss,Okay but sluggish middle section prevents it from being anything more than that,6,12 December 2020,"The West, late 1800s. When a man is killed and three people kidnapped in a small frontier town, a small band sets off to rescue the abductees. The journey will be a hazardous one and, moreover, the abductors are tribe of primitive, savage cave-dwellers. The odds are stacked against the rescuers.A fairly novel film: a Western-horror film, of sorts. Fortunately, the 'horror' side isn't overdone, leaving the film with heaps of potential. Set-up is good and there's a good degree of engagement with the characters.However, the middle section is where all the potential and good scene-setting is wasted as it just ambles along, going on detours that add nothing and padding the movie. Things come together in the final act but even then there are moments where the film drifts and goes nowhere.The film could easily have been 30 minutes shorter and been the better for it.",Bone Tomahawk

And it's rather good. A great cast, mostly at the tops of their games, engage us as they go on their mission: we care about them and want them to succeed even though they - and we - don't really know what they're up against. The very opening shot shows a man having his throat brutally and explicitly cut so, despite some amusing dialogue (which continues throughout - the script is great fun), we understand that this is not a comedy, but no-one is prepared for the savagery they find. This is not a film for kids.It's a good film, though, and entertains solidly throughout its 2 hour-plus running time.",Bone Tomahawk
17,ferguson-6,Well spoken,7,25 October 2015,"Greetings again from the darkness. In an effort to be helpful to potential viewers, it's customary to provide a synopsis that allows for a quick determination on whether this ""type"" of movie will hold appeal. The problem is that this debut from writer/director (and novelist) S. Craig Zahler can be encapsulated with a simple: four local men from a small, dusty old West town head out on a rescue mission to face a tribe of cannibal cave-dwellers. Unfortunately, that analysis doesn't cover the originality and genre-twisting of this Western-Horror film featuring crisp and funny dialogue, plus some of the most extreme brutality ever witnessed on screen.A very deep and talented cast milks the script for every possible chuckle, moan, shock of pain, and queasy squirm. Kurt Russell stars as Franklin Hunt, the sheriff of the ironically named town Bright Hope. Though a long-time fan of Mr. Russell, I've often been critical of his career-limiting role choices, and here he proves yet again that he has always been capable of taking on a challenging lead and delivering a nuanced performance. He is joined in the rescue posse by his ""back-up deputy"" Chicory (Richard Jenkins), the abducted woman's injured husband Arthur (Patrick Wilson), and a nattily attired gunman (Matthew Fox).The opening sequence featuring outlaws Purvis (David Arquette) and Buddy (horror vet Sid Haig doing his best Slim Pickins imitation) sets the stage for the brutal violence to come in the third act, as well as the film's crackling dialogue that's clearly influenced by The Coen Brothers, Quentin Tarantino, and Elmore Leonard. There are also brief but memorable supporting roles from Kathryn Morris (as the Sheriff's wife), Michael Pare' (as a self-centered stable owner), James Tolkan (as an uninspired piano player), and Fred Melamed (as the barkeeper). Lili Simmons (""Banshee"") has a key role as the abducted Samantha O'Dwyer.An odd blending of John Ford's The Searchers and Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes, a substantial portion of the (long) run-time is dedicated to the slow trail ride/walk of the four men as they track the ""troglodyte"" tribe in hopes of rescuing the captured folks. The focus on these four men: the duty-bound Sheriff, the overly loyal deputy, the emotionally-driven husband, and the vengeful gunslinger, is an old West character study dressed up with some fancy oration. In fact, the excessively-perfect English sits in stark contrast to the other-worldly tribal wailings of the cave-dwellers who seem to have no real language at all.It's an unusual film that defies a simple synopsis, and certainly won't appeal to all movie goers. A viewer must enjoy the prolonged journey and the interaction between the distinctive personality types (Jenkins is a particular standout in a Walter Brennan-type role), and also have an affinity (or at least a constitution) for gruesome brutality. The film is only receiving a very limited theatrical release, but should find an audience via VOD.",Bone Tomahawk
18,bombersflyup,Poor taste,2,16 March 2018,"Bone Tomahawk is a western/horror with a good cast. Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox, surely can't miss, well it sure did.Most of the flick's these three actors and an annoying Richard Jenkins walking. Kurt Russell's pretty non-existent even though he's in the whole film. The story's poor and in poor taste, it's just gore for gore's sake. Surprised these class actors got involved in this level of trash. Will try not to watch any more films by S.Zahler.",Bone Tomahawk
19,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Enjoyable if flawed gore-filled Western,7,10 October 2018,"With a series of strange disappearances on his hands, the sheriff of a small Western town discovers that a group of cannibalistic cave-dwellers living nearby have kidnapped several members of the community and sets out with a posse of townspeople to battle the group and retrieve their friends.For the most part, this was an enjoyable if slightly flawed effort. Most of the films' positives are tied into the most impressive feature here which is the blood and gore involved in the kills. The bloodshed here is incredibly enjoyable, not just for the quantity but also the concept of what happens as the cave-dwellers display a penchant for the outright mutilation and dismemberment of their captives, including the show-stopping scene of ripping a person apart using primitive tools. Not only that, but the other kills and wounds that are featured here are just as enjoyable, ranging from the hacking up of bodies and firing of jagged arrows into their bodies or the field operation that's conducted on the one victim which really helps to pull this one out quite nicely. Coupled with the action-packed fun found in the battles throughout their compound which has a lot to really like about it, these here hold it up over its problem areas. Among the biggest issues here is the most obvious element of the film which is its extreme length. While it's still filled with plenty of enjoyable elements, the fact that this one is still so long due to such unnecessary aspects such as the overlong discussions between the men in the beginning or the conversations between the married couple which are completely bland and troublesome to get through. There's not much of anything interesting happening for so long here since the central sequence of the abduction is so early into the film that it's possible for some fun to be had with the early setup yet nothing much occurs of that early setup with so much time spent on the trail where this delves into such extreme stalling tactics to play itself out. The overlong shots of him walking through the desert don't amount to much, and from the in-fighting or run-ins with unneeded characters to further slow them down this section of the film is really overlong. As well as the lack of explanations for anything that goes on here, these are what lower this one overall.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Language and Brief Nudity.",Bone Tomahawk

But their enemy is more ruthless than anyone could have imagined, putting their mission, and survival itself – in serious jeopardy........For face value, this looks like just another western Kurt Russell made after The Hateful Eight, because he had the time and the facial hair. Add an impressive cast and Sean Young, and again, on face value alone, you'd expect some slow burning, but well acted old fashioned western.Ha ha to you if you are thinking of avoiding this because of the above beliefs, because this is so etching else. Even though the opening five minutes teases the viewer with things to come, Bone Tomahawk doesn't just work because of its stranger than thou final forty minutes, it's the camaraderie of the four main characters during their long arduous journey to the unknown.Russell is wonderful as expected, like Jeff Bridges in True Grit but coherent. Wilson plays the walking wounded, and for the most part he does grate a little, but surprises toward the end. But Jenkins is absolutely wonderful as Chicory, and it took me a good hour before I realised that it was him, as he's almost unrecognisable and plays his character down throughout the film.Fox is good, but he looks a little out of place in his white suit and a permanent look on his face as if he's saying 'mmmmmmmmmm'.So for about ninety minutes, give or take a couple of scenes, it's a slow burner, the four men bonding, and coming to blows as their little traits start to aggrieved each other. And although this sounds like a bit of a slog, it's the first five minutes with Arquette and Haig that keep you entranced, because you know that there is a different film here somewhere, and the four protagonists are slowly making their way toward it.And then the film goes in another direction, and I'm not exaggerating when I say it has one of the most disturbing scenes you will see on screen this year. And then it just gets all the more bizarre, and kudos for the film for doing this.The four leads have so much chemistry that the running time just seems to go by so quickly, and there are times among the stark brutality, that there shades of wonderful humour.Heaven knows why this won't get a wide release, twenty years ago it would have been one of the years big releases, but hey, studios don't like taking chances on originality.Catch it as soon as you can, it's one of the best westerns of the last twenty years.",Bone Tomahawk
21,phd_travel,"Spread the word - the scariest, most exciting Western for years",10,10 December 2015,"Wow! This original and very scary Western has set new standards for the genre. The heroism is refreshingly traditional but the tension hasn't been seen before. A group of four men sets off to rescue those who are kidnapped from a cannibalistic tribe in unchartered territory.The story is very well written with a good balance of heroism, humor and horror. The reason it's so scary is you get to know and like the characters first and want them all to survive. And they are all played by leading actors who look just perfect in their Western get up and often play heroes. When the rescuers go into unchartered territory every minute is suspenseful. The ordeal with Patrick Wilson's injured leg is so effective you can almost cringe along with him in pain. Kurt Russell is in his best Western role since Tombstone - his wise gruff demeanor is just spot on as the sheriff. Matthew Fox is well cast as the elegant but ruthless man with a history with the Indians. Comic relief is provided deputy sheriff played by an unrecognizable Richard Jenkins. The humor throughout is original with some genuinely funny dialog. The supporting cast of women is good too, consisting of Kathryn Morris, Sean Young and Lili Simmons.The lack of music is unique and turns out to be more effective and gives a realistic feel to the movie compared to old Westerns where there were some overused themes.There are a few very violent parts but they are part of the story and are relevant to the story. The opening scene and in the cave. The ones in the cave - you know when they are coming so you can cover your eyes and still enjoy 99% of the movie. I haven't been scared in a movie for some time but I was quite terrified in this one. Watch out for anything from this excellent writer director S._Craig_Zahler.",Bone Tomahawk

Lili Simmons plays the cattleman's wife while David Arquette plays a trashy outlaw. Sid Haig has a small role in the opening.""Bone Tomahawk"" (2015) has a surprisingly good cast for an Indie Western that only cost $1.8 million and shot in 21 days. It was the first film written/directed by S. Craig Zahler and reveals a master filmmaker in that he was able to make a quality movie on such a low-budget. The film has the confidence to take its time with interesting characters and entertaining mundane dialogues, which is reminiscent of Tarantino. There are flashes of violence, but this is a slow-burn Western that builds to a rewarding climax.It's a unique Western that meshes the Tarantino-style with realistically mundane Westerns like ""The Homesman"" (2014) and horrific gritty Indies like ""Cry Blood, Apache"" (1970). It's superior to the latter two, especially ""Cry Blood,"" but it's not quite in the ballpark of Tarantino due to lack of funds. Yet it ain't far off either.The movie runs 2 hours, 12 minutes, and was shot at Paramount Ranch, Agoura, California.GRADE: B+/A-",Bone Tomahawk
23,zetes,Draggy,6,11 January 2016,"Disappointing. Its biggest flaw is that it's incredibly lethargic - this is a fairly straightforward Western and there's absolutely no reason that it lasted two and a quarter hours. Kurt Russell, Richard Jenkins, Matthew Fox and Patrick Wilson are tracking a tribe of cannibalistic, troglodyte Indians who have kidnapped Wilson's wife and a couple of others from a small Western town. Russell is best in show by far. Between this and The Hateful Eight, Westerns really seem to be in his wheelhouse, particularly if he grows some impressive facial hair. The other three stars are mostly weak (Lili Simmons, who plays the wife, is decent). The other great part of the film are the monstrous troglodytes, who are legitimately freaky. The dialogue is often bad and the direction is often poor. The whole climax lands with a thud, and it ends abruptly. Despite its flaws, I thought it had some worth and I certainly don't regret watching it.",Bone Tomahawk

I mean, clocking in over é hours and the most of that time is talking then you really must be in the mood to watch this. But hey, there are series out (House Of Cards) that is all about talking.But Bone Tomahawk does deliver an extra towards the end once they entered the cave with the wild men. It's that part most viewers are talking about. Once the final starts the talking is over and the action comes in, and when the action comes in it's pure gore. What did kept me watching is the acting itself that is way above mediocre, Kurt Russell and his companions does deliver the goods. Not a flick for those who want action and violence, be honest, it's made in the era of The Hateful Eight and it shows.

There are some really good ones as there are some bad ones. When I saw this one was going to be a mix of western and horror I was naturally intrigued. The story in the beginning is starting slow and that lasts for a big part of the movie. Slow but certainly not bad. The cast is perfect for this movie. All actors bring something special to the movie. I was really enjoying this western and was kinda wondering where the horror parts were that I read about. But they did show up at the end and it was sometimes really gore. My wife had to look away a couple of times. I loved it. It certainly brings this movie to another level. The ending was full of suspense and some disgusting passages but this made the movie special. I would recommend this movie to people that like westerns and horror movies.

The story is of a trek of four men, going to rescue people from their little town kidnapped by cave dweller troglodytes. It is not a happy movie.But what really shines is the acting, the carefully crafted characters in the script and the way each thing in the film has value. One of the best things in it for me is how the movie ignored Chekhov's Gun and the Red Herrings and just did a believable, historically accurate and gritty story, and did it well.Glad to see Kurt Russel return to form, Richard Jenkins is brilliant as ever, almost didn't recognized him in the film, Matthew Fox proves again that he is a good actor - too bad Lost ended any significant career he might have had until now, I hope that changes soon and Patrick Wilson again does a good job.There is no real closure to the film.

I was just in the mood for a good western, which is the reason I wanted to check this movie out. So yeah, this is a part western and a part graphic horror movie. I heard that it's a pretty brutal and violent flick. Although I have seen worst, this is a pretty brutal movie, especially near the end. This film combines pretty decent western style elements, especially because of the characterization of the characters and their dynamic approach to situations. I thought all the actors did a fairly decent job with this, it isn't anything all that new when it comes to western characters. But they brought there own character into this, which includes a dutiful and collective Sheriff played by Kurt Russell. His sidekick, a wannabe gentleman played by Matthew Fox and a dutiful husband cowboy played by Patrick Wilson. The plot is a western rescue mission, that deals with looters, bandits and the most savage and psychotic Indian tribe that are of a special breed.

29,sddavis63,Whatever This Was Supposed To Be - It Was Bad,2,24 October 2018,"From this movie's description I expected it to be a sort of western-horror hybrid. That could be enjoyable enough, so I settled in to watch it. But it wasn't really that horrific, and for long parts of the script it seems to be trying to be a sort of dry comedy with an element of mystery. Basically it's a bizarre hybrid of a whole lot of different genres that really didn't work together all that well.The movie started out strong enough, with a rather brutal murder depicted and, with one of the murderers being then killed himself by an arrow shot from somewhere by someone, you get the impression that there's going to be a lot of action in this. But then it settles down. It really settles. The remaining murderer is put in jail, tended to by a female doctor and guarded by a deputy - and then all three mysteriously disappear. Told by a local native man about a mysterious tribe of cannibals he calls ""troglodytes,"" the sheriff sets out with a small posse to find them and bring them home.And then we settle in for a marathon of nothing much happening. So little happened in fact that I literally fell asleep for a good 20 minutes - and I watched this in the middle of the afternoon. It does pick up in the last half hour or so when the posse finally encounters the troglodytes, and at that point the movie actually becomes graphically and at times unpleasantly violent as the posse and the troglodytes square off with each other.""Bone Tomahawk"" has a reasonably well known but certainly not A-list of actors (headed by Kurt Russell as the sheriff.) Sometimes they seem to be trying valiantly to make this work, but there are also scenes when they seem to realize it's a lost cause, and for the most part they're burdened with a script full of inanities. Once this was over I did go back and watch the 20 minutes or so that I fell asleep for. It didn't help. (2/10)",Bone Tomahawk
30,Hellmant,Tarantinoesque!,9,5 February 2016,"'BONE TOMAHAWK': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A western-horror flick, from writer/director S. Craig Zahler (who previously wrote the 2011 horror movie 'ASYLUM BLACKOUT'). Zahler (who also co-composed the music for the film) makes his directorial debut; with this innovative genre-bender. The story revolves around four men, in the Old West, who set out to rescue captives from vicious troglodytes. The movie stars Kurt Russell (in his second western, of the year), Patrick Wilson, Richard Jenkins, Matthew Fox, Lili Simmons, Evan Jonigkeit and David Arquette; it also features cameos by Sid Haig, Sean Young, Kathryn Morris, Fred Melamed, James Tolkan and Michael Pare. The movie is a very impressive debut film, from the first-time director!Russell stars as Sheriff Franklin Hunt, and Jenkins plays his backup deputy, Chicory. The two men are startled to discover that their small (and very peaceful) town, has been attacked by cave dwelling cannibals. The murderous clan took town residents with them, as captives; including another deputy, named Nick (Jonigkeit), and the town doctor's assistant, Samantha (Simmons). Hunt and Chicory set out to rescue the prisoners; with the help of Samantha's crippled husband, Arthur (Wilson), and a local womanizer, named Brooder (Fox). Brooder is also very educated, and extremely experienced in killing Native Americans (which he has a vengeance for).The movie is filled with very witty dialogue, and rich character development (in a somewhat Tarantinoesque style). A lot of the film plays out like a classic, good old fashioned, western. It also contains very strong (and extremely jarring) horror elements. The troglodyte clan makes for some very memorable (and classic) movie villains; and the film has some extremely brutal gore in it. It's pretty hard to watch at times (from the opening shot of the movie), and very hard to forget. The cast is all exceptional, as well; especially Jenkins, Fox and Russell (who's had a great comeback this year). The film is sure to be remembered as a popular cult classic; one of the year's best!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/0d1sap746-M",Bone Tomahawk
31,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Deadly dull western foray,4,29 November 2016,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning A gang of cannibalistic savages kidnap a number of people who live in the small town of Bright Hope in the mid west. No nonsense lawman Sheriff Franklin Hunt (Kurt Russell) leads the expedition to find them, but their enemy is more brutal and ruthless than even they could have imagined.The western is a re-emerging genre that I'm still struggling to come to terms with. But, with the exception of the recent 12A rated The Magnificent Seven, it's one that looks like it isn't afraid to show its teeth, with Tarantino's The Hateful Eight at the end of last year/start of this year a nearly three hour unremitting bloodbath (and, actually, although it made less of an impression on me, lets not forget 2012's Django Unchained.) Kurt Russell, one of the stars of that film, headlines this off-kilter little effort which, despite its gore, is for the most part sadly redundant.These films always aim to capture a certain type of lingering mood and atmosphere, and debut director S. Craig Zahler has managed to get this right, letting Russell and the rest of the all male main cast let their slow, gravelly introspection and words set the tone rather than any soundtrack. As one of the new, emerging sixty plus action leading men, Russell himself certainly hasn't lost any of his commanding presence. Sadly, the film itself is just overly slow and boring, with too much of a threadbare plot to really sustain itself at over two hours, and by the time the brutal blood and gore has rolled round, you've lost interest.Sadly, not so much Bone Tomahawk as Bore Tomahawk. **",Bone Tomahawk
32,A_Different_Drummer,"""For a man named Buddy you are not very friendly"" (dialog)",8,28 October 2015,"""It's about 9:00 but it feels like next week"" (dialog) This is a film that owes a debt to the 1956 classic The Searchers, a film as much about finding an abductee as it is about the people doing the search.The ""horror"" subtheme is merely a bonus, and a fun one at that.It is not merely an indie, but an ""auteur"" indie -- that's the classification your reviewer is giving to the large influx of films in the last 24 months where the writer and director are one and the same.In film history, auteurs by themselves are not a new concept; what IS new and interesting is that, as television in this decade is starting to leapfrog Hollywood in terms of quality and excellence, this new class of artist is taking up the slack by using the proved medium of film as a convenient mechanism to show their stuff and define their aspirations.Craig Zahler is defining his aspirations with Bone Tomahawk, and it is not a bad start. To make these idies work, you need to get maximum audience connection with the least amount of resources. Zahler achieves that with a tight cast, led by one of my faves, Kurt Russell. I have been watching Kurt since the 1950s - not a misprint -- and his work in Soldier was so good that, if you have not seen it, stop wasting time with this review and go find a copy - NOW. It is also ironic that another of Kurt's best roles was as Wyatt Earp, and here is he is replaying a Marshall but in a different context. Always a pro, never a bad performance.The direction is fully competent but the script itself is a joy, with many interesting bits of dialog for the discerning ear to discover and enjoy.Recommended",Bone Tomahawk

The movie is really just another hunt and chase film but it had something extra that made it seem exciting and kept me watching all the way to the end wanting to see what happens next.

35,ironhorse_iv,I'm going to throw this western movie a bone! It deserves more praise. The motion picture was an entertaining watch.,7,15 January 2020,"There is no doubt that the filmmakers like director S. Craig Zahler & his crew really did work their fingers to the bone when making this movie about a Wild West Sherriff Franklin Hunt (Kurt Russell) leading a posse into the desolate desert mountains to rescue two townspeople from a cannibalistic murderous cave dwelling tribe. It was executed quite well with very few mistakes. Pretty impressive for somebody first movie being filmed over 21 days in a very limited few locations with only using the 1st drafted of his script. While some critics might say that the film moves in a very slow paced with very limited action with certain kills happening off screen. I'm kinda glad that the film did it that way. It build up the suspense and wasn't too in your face. Nor was the action over the top. The violence is realistic quick & grotesque whenever it does happen onscreen. While you don't really get a good glimpse of what is happening sometimes. I like that nearly no forced music being played over it. It allow the sounds of the unknown haunted you to build tension. The majority of what you hear is the sound effect of people being hacked apart. It's really disturbing. Only one scene is fairly detail with a person getting his head scalp, genitals getting mutilated and then ripped apart by troglodytes. Warning! That infamous graphic NSFW moment in the cave is not for the faint of heart. It's emotionally scarring. Just wish the movie gave that character a little more of a backstory. He felt like a stock disposable redshirt. Regardless the sound design was still amazing. Not only that, but the cinematography was just as good. The way the background are frame with everybody around in wide shots was something worth seeing. There is no better example of that than all three men riding off into the desert. One thing I kinda wish the movie was a little bit better on was the plot. While the fictional story had very few factual historical errors, it was still kinda generic. Partly inspired by the works of author H. Rider Haggard. The basic concept felt honestly nothing new. Just see 1956 John Wayne's masterpiece 'The Searchers' and you got yourself a very similar premise just updated and more political correctly when depicting Native Americans and little more progressive with women. Plus the plot could had been a little more flushed out on how the kidnapping occurred. It seem far-fetched for a tribe not use to going beyond their caves to break out a season criminal out of jail in a town day 3 miles away without horses in the burning desert. I felt that the movie could had cut all the scenes involving the drifters and just focus on a wagon of town people gone missing or a homestead being built too close to their cave. It would had save the moment a lot of screen time. Have it similar to the opening of 2008 Western horror movie 'The Burrowers'. Regardless one thing the movie does right is the dialogue. I really enjoyed the witty conversations and the vibe between the characters. The quotes felt genuine and authentic to the time period. To add onto that, all the actors in this film did a hell of a job with their roles. Patrick Wilson as Arthur O'Dwyer was amazing. The pain that he goes throughout the film, you can honestly feel. Kurt Russell was a badass even if the character seem a bit Wyatt Earp Tombstone-ish with commanding delivery. Nevertheless the two actors that really brought their A Game has to be Matthew Fox as well-spoken pompous gunman John Brooder & Richard Jenkins as good hearted broken down assistant deputy named Chicory. The back and forth bicker fighting between their characters was very entertaining especially who is smarter. I can see this movie being study over in the years to come. In the end, all four of the main individuals in this film could be seem as interpretation of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse with each of them holding a similar trait bringing the end of primordial savagery within the Wild West. Overall: Make no bones about it. This visceral movie was nearly a masterpiece. So don't be a bone head. Go see this western! It's worth the watch.",Bone Tomahawk
36,Reno-Rangan,Meet the most savage people of the American native.,7,14 July 2016,"This was one of the three western films I've watched back to back recently. The other two were 'The Salvation' and 'The Homesman'. They all were totally different from each other and I enjoyed them a lot. I did not know what this title means, but I learnt it before going for it which means some kind of axe used by the American Indians. So I have waited for that moment to know why the film's called that and then, omg, I was very shocked, totally uncomfortable to watch that part. I felt like it was a western version of 'The Hills Have Eyes'.This was a road movie. A group of peoples' journey to rescue those who were abducted by some mountain tribes. The rescue was the third act and the rest of the film was about how they make into that remote place. Obviously a slow pace, makes you sit whatever position you want, but after the 90 minutes you will be more focused than before as the narration gets tense. The best part of the film in any western the audience were looking for finally arrives. It was a simple, but very strong and disturbing.The cast was the plus point, everyone did their part best. Even the music and the locations were very nice and appropriate. One of the rare western films I've seen, with a mix of horror-terror. This is the cheapest film and shot within a month of time, but a fine production and completely unexpected film. Possible for a sequel, but I think that's not a good idea unless it retains the same crew. If you're okay with a slow narration, then you will enjoy it. Compared to the opening, when it ends, you will feel satisfied. It is not a greatest western of all time, but still worth a watch.7/10",Bone Tomahawk

I found the film overlong.The action starts when Troglodytes abduct the town's doctor, Samantha, as well as the deputy and a drifter. An unlikely rescue party then goes after them: an ageing Sheriff, an old and forgetful deputy, Samantha's husband - who has an injured leg - and a ""smart man"" (to use his own words). When things started going very wrong, I think I longed for those quieter moments.There's some incredibly gruesome scenes that can never be unseen.

38,sol-,The Searchers,6,4 December 2016,"Things gradually take a turn for the worse when four Old West townspeople set out to rescue a local woman taken hostage by a cannibalistic Native American tribe in this slow-burn western with several pronounced horror elements. The film deserves full marks for capturing the flavour and mood of the Wild West through authentic sets and costumes and thoughtful dialogue. It quickly becomes apparent how strongly the townspeople believe all Native Americans to be savages and what they later endure almost seems like a comeuppance of sorts for their judgmental attitudes. The final 45 minutes of the movie are also very strong as the search party finally comes in contact with the tribe, however, the fact that it takes the film an hour and a half to reach this point never quite makes sense. Their journey is drawn out to the point that any suspense or sense of danger lingering in the air soon dissipates. The conversations between the characters also become quite dry with several of the same topics recycled again and again - particularly flea circuses. On the same account though, this gradualness renders the final 45 minutes all the more shocking in their brutality. The film benefits from a very chilling theme song too and Kurt Russell is unexpectedly excellent in a key role as the hard-nosed sheriff of the town. His leadership is really tested by the events of the final 45 minutes and the film is every bit about him as it is about the woman being rescued and her injured husband.",Bone Tomahawk
39,tomgillespie2002,Will delight fans of both genres,8,6 March 2016,"Although a few recent attempts to re-energise the genre for a modern audience have failed both critically and commercially (Wild Wild West (1999) and The Lone Ranger (2013) come immediately to mind), film-makers still find themselves irresistibly drawn to the western genre, which is so steeped in Hollywood history yet ripe for re- visioning. This year alone has seen Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu's The Revenant tell a tale of America's rough fur-trapping forefathers, John Maclean spin a violent love story involving a cigar-chomping outlaw in Slow West, and Tarantino lock eight genre archetypes together in a room for The Hateful Eight.The most original, engaging and surely destined for cult success is Bone Tomahawk, a western told with a tip of the hat to the John Ford and Howard Hawks classics of the 1950's and 60's, yet with a heavy dose of horror inspired by the grimy inbred/cannibal films of the 70's brought to terrifying life by Tobe Hooper and Wes Craven. It doesn't sound like a harmonious mix, but it certainly is (as long as you have the stomach for it). Opening with a particularly gruesome throat-slicing, author and first-time director S. Craig Zahler makes his love for the grotesque clear from the outset, but then settles down to set in motion a classical men-on-a-mission yarn, only with the knowledge that cave-dwelling monstrosities are the destination.After butchering and robbing a group of travellers, low-lives Buddy (Sig Haig) and Purvis (David Arquette) stumble upon some kind of sacred burial ground. The tribe responsible make their displeasure at the thieves' arrival immediately known, and only Purvis escapes with his life. Arriving in the town of Bright Hope, Purvis is quickly rumbled as a thief and shot in the leg by sheriff Hunt (Kurt Russell) who, assisted by his back-up deputy Chicory (Richard Jenkins) and the town doctor Samantha (Lili Simmons), imprison him for the night. However, the next morning Purvis, Samantha and Deputy Nick (Evan Jonigkeit) have vanished, with a local stable boy disembowelled and some horses stolen.In The Seachers (1956) fashion, Hunt and Chicory set out to confront the cave-dwellers (dubbed 'troglodytes') along with Samantha's cowboy husband Arthur (Patrick Wilson), heavily injured with a broken leg, and the bigoted yet brutally efficient gunslinger Brooder (Matthew Fox). At 132 minutes, Bone Tomahawk is mainly about the journey which will take days even if things go to plan, never mind the threat of bandits and whatever the creatures are awaiting them. Zahler's witty script and some great casting choices ensure that their odyssey is never slow. Russell is Russell but he is still great, while Wilson has by now perfected wounded masculinity. However, it's Jenkins and Fox who stand out. Jenkins is a great actor so it is to be expected, but Seth Rogen's sly dig at Fox in Knocked Up (2007) always rang true with me. Here, he carefully treads the line between despicable and cool, making us hate him yet still root for him. Despite being the most disposable of the leads, he is the most interesting character of the group.After much character-building and obstacles to overcome, the film doesn't hold back when we finally arrive at the end. Without venturing into torture-porn territory, Zahler delivers a series of brutal scenes and delights in exploring new ways to make you wince in horror. At one point, I feared that one male character was about to be raped, but then something even worse and unexpected happens, which is made all the more effective by the absence of CGI. It's enough to delight fans of both genres, and the blend of old- fashioned derring-do and no-nonsense horror makes for the kind of experience genre fans long for. While it may be slightly self- indulgent given the heavy running time, this is only slight criticism of a film that feels like it ends at just the right moment. Injecting new life into both genres, it will be interesting to see where Zahler goes from here.",Bone Tomahawk
40,leonblackwood,"Pretty slow, but the action scenes were quite gruesome. 5/10",5,11 September 2016,"Review: What a weird movie! This film is definitely NOT for the squeamish, because there are some scenes which will turn your stomach. I personally found a lot of the film quite boring, because it does take some time for something to happen, but once the cannibalistic troglodytes make an appearance, the film switches to a gruesome horror. Kurt Russell (Franklin Hunt), plays the towns sheriff, who goes into the wilderness to find Patrick Wilson's (Arthur), wife, who has been abducted by the troglodytes. They also abducted his prisoner, Purvis, (David Arquette), so his handy sidekick, Chicory (Richard Jenkins) and a man who has battled with the troglodytes, Brooder (Matthew Fox) decide to join him on his epic journey. As Arthur has damaged his leg, he is only able to follow them for some of the journey, so it's basically 3 men, heading out to fight a bunch of human eating weirdos. You do feel a sense of intensity throughout the movie, because you don't know what is going to pop out in the desert but the pace was pretty slow. Its good to see Kurt Russell back on top form, and the emotion that he showed towards the end was brilliant. It was also good to see Matthew Fox play a role which is out of his comfort zone, and Richard Jenkins babbling about complete rubbish, added a sense of humour to this shocking film. Anyway, it's definitely worth a watch, from a shock value point of view but it does take some time to get going. Watchable!Round-Up: For such a low budget, and with some top actors, it's good to see something decent come out of the independent film market. It was written and directed by S.Craig Zahler, who hasn't made any previous movies but is known for his horror books, which explains some of the gruesome scenes in this film. I was quite impressed with the script and the chemistry between the characters was believable but it really didn't have to be over 2 hours long. For a project that only took 21 days to shoot, the director achieved a lot with the top actors, and after the success of this movie, I'm sure his budgets will rise and we will be seeing some more of his novels converted for the big screen.Budget: $1.8million Worldwide Gross: N/AI recommend this movie to people who are into their adventure/drama/horrors, starring Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox, Richard Jenkins, Lili Simmons, David Arquette and Sean Young. 5/10",Bone Tomahawk
41,TheMovieDiorama,Bone Tomahawk substitutes traditional western genre tropes for plenty of gore.,7,27 February 2018,"Now y'all know westerns are my least favourite type of film. I find them slow, monotonous, boring and unmemorable. They just don't appeal to me. Suffice to say, I am pleasantly surprised by this. A drifter desecrates an ancient burial ground that belongs to a cannibalistic tribe. Captured by the local sheriff, a young woman is abducted in the crossfire and it's up to some residents to rescue her. We've got horses aplenty. Desolate wasteland landscapes. Enough facial hair and hats to supply a drag cabaret show. And...we have a scene where a guy is stripped, scalped and ferociously sliced in half. What. The. Actual. Flip? I loved the third act. Adored it even. It felt fresh, exciting and packed full of grit. The practical makeup effects were flawless, looked incredibly natural. So realistic and extreme, that I squirmed not once, not twice but thrice! The sheer brutality and gore is something you would find in a Tarantino flick. I found the acting to be rather good actually. Kurt Russell and Patrick Wilson held the film together, but the stand out was Richard Jenkins who I didn't even recognise. Fantastic makeup. Matthew Fox also delivered a good performance. The characters themselves were not always interesting or captivating, but their interactions with each other felt authentic. The occasional banter assists in the surprising comedic undertone within the screenplay. A noteworthy directorial debut from Zahler. However, as with all westerns in my opinion, the pace is like a rollercoaster. A ten second kill is followed by ten minutes of wandering the wilderness. A one minute stand off is followed by a ten minute camping story. Exciting, boring, compelling, uninteresting. It might just be me and my dislike towards these films, but the first two acts couldn't escape the inconsistent pacing that is all too typical from westerns. Having said that, Bone Tomahawk is intelligent in its execution. The bloody third act alone saves this from being forgettable.",Bone Tomahawk

Its very rare to come across a good western horror mash up n this one is amazeballs.This film is not at all boring. The dialogues r good, the character development is brilliant n the acting is top notch.The pacing of the film is well complemented with intelligent and witty humor and highly likable characters n a sense of brooding dread.Debutante director, Zahler did a terrific job considering the budget.
I own the dvd of Asylum Blackout of which he is the writer.Before diving into the brutality n shocking violent confrontation, we r given solid tension, suspense, the ominous loactions n a sense of brooding dread.Much of the film is shot in amazing sun-soaked settings. Some really good work by the cinematographer Benji Bakshi.The director is heavily influenced by classics such as The Searchers n Hills have Eyes.

45,videorama-759-859391,Apocolypto meets the west,8,15 February 2018,"Fresh off the heals of The Hateful Eight, Kurt Russell is right back in the saddle again, and this is exactly where we want him. This pic, I happened to catch the other night, only first learning of it's existence a few weeks before, exceeded my expectations as in the quality of the picture from it's photography to it's great script. With a great cast actors who never drop their guard, the spot on casting was one of the prime things I liked about this refreshing surprise of a western, while being overly entertaining and absorbing in a great and carefully structured and told tale, of a group of townsfolk riders, primarily the law, taking up the quota, minus one for a concerned party (Wilson, who we don't see enough in film) retrieve some townsfolk, which includes Wilson's hot wife, who we saw beautifully bare in a nice fornicating scene earlier in the peace, for which we audience, are truly grateful. They are believed to have been taken by a savage merciless group, of tribal Indian folk, but a shocking spin on this, is that they are cannibalistic sons of bitches. You can easily tell in this film, that a lot of gore was cut, right from the opening neck slitting reel. Russell as the sheriff, is a much more sober, and softer type of character to what he was in Hateful 8, although he displays some small characteristics. Jenkins is absolutely terrific, doing his best work, as Russell's older lawful compadre, but it's Matthew Fox as a slightly sleazy and smug deputy, who once tried to get fresh with Wilson's wife, that steals your interest. Fox's small filmography over thirty years is criminal, if you consider how great an actor, this guy is (this is the same clean cut, moustached chief superviser who bought it in Smokin' Aces) while Wilson as the determined husband, determined to get the love of his life back, again never drops guard. Bone Tomahawk is a fresh and highly entertaining western, with some pretty heavy shock violence, mostly near the end, with solid acting to boot, but probably the finale music score could of been a little better applied. Other than that, steer up for another high riding adventure, with a much more sympathetic and civilized posse, other than those cold 8.",Bone Tomahawk
46,subxerogravity,Kurt Russell stars in a wild WILD Western Masterpiece,8,28 October 2015,"When I saw the poster of the movie, I was thinking it was going to be a slow western. Most of it is.But what a cool story! Kurt Russell is a sheriff who gathers a posse to rescue three citizens from a tribe of savage cannibals! And I do mean savage. The horror elements in the film had me worming in my seat. They were not playing around with the concept of wild frontier in this film. Some of it was really, really hard to watch(which is so cool!)A lot of the movie is very slow, but luckily, Russell accompanied with Patrick Wilson and Matthew Fox played characters that were really fun and interesting on the screen.Fun being a key word, as the film goes from gritty to grim to humorous, and it blends so well.Plus the gun play is really good, done to show effectiveness versus dramatics.This was truly a great western, worth becoming a classic in the genre.",Bone Tomahawk
47,Turfseer,"Pointless ""Horror Western"" gore-fest is guaranteed to offend most members of the Native American community",2,18 February 2016,"Bone Tomahawk is the creation of one S. Craig Zahler who is listed in Wikipedia as a jack of all trades: ""author, screenwriter, songwriter, musician, director and cinematographer."" Zahler's concoction fits into a literary sub-genre known as ""weird west""—again thanks to Wikipedia we learn that this sub-genre ""combines elements of the Western with another literary genre, usually horror, occult, or fantasy.""Zahler is content to promulgate the myth of a violent, wild west, replete with cowboys armed with six-shooters and rapacious Indians bent on scalping the first settler they see. Unfortunately, the reality is that the so-called wild west was far less violent than what we see today regarding criminal activity. You can find late 19th century photos on the internet from places like Dodge City, sporting billboards that read ""the carrying of firearms is strictly forbidden."" Zahler's chief desire appears to be out-dueling Tarantino for the coveted most in love with violence writer/director award in American cinema today. Indeed, he begins his magnum opus with Tweedledum and Tweedledee killers, Purvis and Buddy, who murder innocent travelers off the beaten path. Buddy, as you may already know, falls victim to a bunch of Indians who I guarantee did not exist in the 1890s when the film takes place (nor ever existed), and Purvis then makes his way to the town of Bright Hope, which was filmed at the Paramount Ranch.This location has been used for years as a stand-in for a small, wild western town. Unfortunately, Zahler's low budget prevented his crew from making enough alterations so that the town appears lived in. Zahler trots out a few stock characters including the sheriff Franklin Hunt (decently played by Kurt Russell), his old codger backup deputy, Chicory, and John Brooder, a more intellectual ""ladies man,"" who attempts to summon the town doctor after Hunt shoots bad guy Purvis who can't keep himself from acting up at the local saloon. With the doctor drunk, Brooder finds the doctor's assistant, Samantha, who has just finished a steady bout of lovemaking with her husband Arthur O'Dwyer, a foreman who's laid up in bed with a nasty leg injury.While Hunt, Chicory and Brooder investigate the murder of a stable hand (the usual ""dispensable"" black guy), Samantha, Hunt's regular deputy Nick and Purvis are found to be missing back at the jail. Instead of summoning help (perhaps in the form of military personnel), Hunt forms an unlikely posse including Chicory and Brooder and is talked into allowing O'Dwyer (who can barely walk with his injured leg) to trek through the wilderness, hoping to locate their missing compatriots. O'Dwyer's love (or should I say lust?) is so great that he's willing to crawl through the desert to find his lost Samantha.Before they depart, an arrow found at the jail is examined by a local Native American wise man who links it to a place called ""Valley of the Starving Men,"" where a group of troglodytes (cave-dwellers) is probably to blame for the kidnapping of Samantha and the deputy. The wise man (who sounds more like a professor at a local college), advises that the troglodytes are shunned by normal Native Americans and in fact are cannibalistic savages.The next sequence (which is quite long) involves the posse heading for hostile territory. Along the way, Brooder kills two Mexican scouts and later the group's horses are stolen by rustlers. O'Dwyer re-injures his leg after fighting with Brooder and is left by the rest of the group to recuperate (before insanely trying to rejoin them, again basically crawling through the desert).I will not detail how exactly the posse ends up imprisoned in the troglodytes' cave but suffice it to say Brooder is the first casualty. While Zahler perhaps technically cannot be accused of racism because he makes it clear that his troglodytes are an ostracized group of Native Americans, the introduction of these characters into the narrative, leaves a bad taste in one's mouth. First of all, these type of ""savages"" were never known to exist in the ""wild west,"" but are still associated here with Native American culture. All disclaimers aside, the mere image of Native Americans perpetrating ghastly acts of savagery on ""white people"" should be enough to upset any Native American when he ponders such ""untruths"" in a darkened movie theater. Of course the reality is that acts of savagery occurred the other way around—it was the US military of course which was responsible for the great numbers of heinous crimes against the Native American population during the 19th century.The pointlessness of Zahler's tale reaches its apotheosis when the audience is forced to witness the scalping of Nick the deputy and his dismemberment at the hands of the zombie-like troglodytes. If we must witness such cheap thrills, why doesn't Zahler turn his zombies into a bunch of aliens so that the perpetuation of the myth of the savage ""Indian,"" is repudiated?Perhaps with the dismemberment scene Zahler has gone toe to toe with Tarantino, and won. In addition to Zahler's apparent victory over the master of gore himself, I am also forced to conclude that Bone Tomahawk defies its internal logic (how does O'Dwyer manage to get himself up into the cave with his injured leg? And why does Samantha remain apparently untouched by the savage troglodytes?) Is there a more pointless film than Bone Tomahawk among the selection of Spirit Award hopefuls? I don't think so. Not only is it pointless but offensive to boot. See it at your peril!",Bone Tomahawk
48,jadavix,Tarantino without chatter is still pretty empty,5,18 March 2018,"After watching ""Bone Tomahawk"" and the more recent ""Brawl in Cell Block 99"" back-to-back, I have come to the conclusion that S. Craig Zahler's films are like Quentin Tarantino's output, minus the chatter. This would seem to be a good thing, but this absence of boring dialogue actually serves to illustrate its purpose: it provides the illusion of content. Zahler's films are baggy and empty and tedious, but unlike Tarantino's, they don't occupy you for most of their runtime. From Tarantino, you turn away exhausted. From Zahler, you turn away, merely bored.Zahler is like Tarantino in other ways. For one thing, his films bring in a tonne of capable actors and character actors. Incredibly, ""Bone Tomahawk"" was Zahler's first movie in the director's chair, and yet the cast is amazing. There's Kurt Russell (also a Tarantino fave), Sid Haig (an even bigger Tarantino fave), David Arquette, Sean Young, Richard Jenkins, Michael Parè, Fred Melamed (you know the face, if not the name). But most impressive of all: the legendary character actor, in his eighties here, and appearing in what will probably be his last ever role... James Tolkan. Not even Tarantino could get him! (Maybe Tolkan thinks he's a slacker? Doubtful).None of these fine and recognizable actors were really necessary, I don't think. This is hardly an actor's picture; they seem dwarfed by the sets and locations and too-long run time, which, weirdly, is the exact same length as ""Brawl in Cell Block 99"". Did Zahler do that on purpose?It feels like nothing happens for the majority of both of these movies. They're uninvolving and fail to generate any tension or interest. This is a brutal horror movie/western, but it doesn't even try to be scary or suspenseful. Again, like ""Brawl"", there are some fairly violent moments early in the movie to whet the appetite for the extraordinary gore you get at the end. We're talking scalpings, decapitations, and longitudinal bisection. (In ""Brawl"", it was mostly head-stompings leading to face and head-loss).That is, essentially, what Zahler's two movies are about: violence. So why does he make us wait so long to witness it?",Bone Tomahawk
49,freemantle_uk,A fantastic genre mash-up,8,14 November 2021,"Bone Tomahawk is a film that has earned a cult following and deservedly so. It was a Western-horror mash-up, or to be more specific it was a Western version of The Hills Have Eyes.

50,dfranzen70,Facial hair versus ashy skin,7,12 August 2019,"Bone Tomahawk (what a great title!) is a real genre mashup, horror and western - the likes of which you've probably not seen before. The action is light until the final third of the film or so, bu the tension that steadily mounts in the first two-thirds will have you jumping at bells jingling and other startling sounds. Seems a prisoner, a deputy, and the doctor charged with removing the bullet from the prisoner's leg have all vanished over the course of the night. The sheriff (Kurt Russell) sets out to find the trio, aided by his backup to the deputy (Richard Jenkins), a learned man with a predilection for killing Indians (Matthew Fox), and the doctor's husband (Patrick Wilson), who's nursing a bad leg. The lone Indian in their tiny western town is pretty sure who did the kidnapping, based off an arrow found in the jail, and he's of the opinion that it's a group of cave-dwellers - troglodytes. As the sheriff and his posse search, tensions mount among them, and the leg of the doctor's husband acts up time and time again. What they do find when they finally come upon the cave holding the captives and their intimidating captors isn't quite the run-of-the-mill stuff you'd find in an old Western, and that's where the action, terrifying and fleet but so satisfying, kicks in. Bone Tomahawk makes hay out of the long trek to find the trio, and the tribulations of life on the trail, particularly as the men run low on provisions, is expertly told and lends a true sense of realism to the proceedings. Aside from that mounting tension, the first half is pulled together wonderfully by Russell and by Jenkins as the addled backup tin star. Jenkins steals the movie.",Bone Tomahawk

52,parry_na,"Sun scorched and occasionally funny, occasionally brutal.",7,21 June 2018,"Directed with leisurely assurance by S. Craig Zahler (who is also the writer), this very witty, slow-burning western/horror hybrid is compelling viewing, even when very little appears to be happening. The long, talky scenes in the first half of the film work well because the dialogue is very natural and often genuinely amusing, all played by an excellent cast. When anything horrific or brutal occurs, it does so very quickly with barely any lead-up. Blink and you'll miss it. However, as the 132 minute story rolls on, these occurrences move increasingly centre-stage. Getting to that point can arduous at times, however, and things drag from time to time.The locations, stunningly filmed, perfect that balance between beautiful and unforgiving terrain. It is this environment that plays host to some stomach-churning scenes, filmed completely without spectacle, and often without the comfort of incidental music.Can this be compared to 'From Dusk till Dawn (1996)?' In that 'Bone Tomahawk' begins as one kind of film and ends up quite another, yes it can. But in other ways, not so much. Where there was an addictive sensationalist lightness to even the more gruesome moments in Tarantino's film, here all the frivolity is saved for the earlier, character-establishing scenes. There's no joking when the raiders show up. Although you have to wait rather too long to see them, it is worth it.I'm not going to name specific members of the cast because everyone is excellent, and even more than that, there are no stereotypes. Far from it. Here, personality and likability wins out over young, pretty and arrogant. If you do not have believable characters, it is that much harder to get the audience to follow them, much less invest in them. This film may well have benefited from a bit of pruning, but it is nevertheless an immersive experience, which also does something different in its approach to horror.",Bone Tomahawk

54,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Stark, brutally unflinching western",10,26 October 2015,"Bone Tomahawk is a film that takes your expectations, stabs them in the face and hacks out its own uniquely paced narrative that ducks clichés, clings to authentic realism and knows how to both get you invested in character, and put your hairs on end when these people you've come to love get put through unimaginable horrors in the third act. When a movie with a running time of two hours and fifteen minutes has me wishing it was longer, it's gotta be doing something right. This one does pretty much everything right. Starting with the script as it's the first thing you notice, there's a faithful dedication to the actual old west vernacular on display, resulting in shakespearian exchanges that call to mind David Milch's iconic Deadwood. Then there's the writing itself; characters interact about mundane things and gradually through idle talk and restless banter we grow attached to these wildly different people. Then there's the frank brutality of the harrowing third act, much anticipated, and as a result of the film taking its time getting there, we get all the more horrified when the bloodshed hits us in measured, stark quality. Kurt Russell can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned, and he makes a stout hearted protagonist here as Sheriff Franklin Hunt, his rule of law abiding in a small southern community. When local girl Mrs. O Dwyer (Lilli Simmons) and several others are kidnapped by a clan of cannibalistic cave dwelling troglodytes, Hunt forms a four man posse to set out into the wild and rescue them. Along with him is Mr. O Dwyer, played by Patrick Wilson, another actor who doesn't ever miss a beat for me, making fascinating work of an awkward role. Richard Jenkins, always stellar, plays childlike Deputy Chicory, an amiable, talkative dude with a kind disposition that shines forth even in the most hopeless of situations. Matthew Fox surprised me by shedding his clean cut nice guy image for a clean cut badass image, as dapper, no nonsense pistol packer John Brooder, sporting a fancy suit and a lack of moral high ground. David Arquette and horror vet Sid Haig play lowlife bandits, and there's a juicy supporting cast including Michael Paré, Sean Young, Kathryn Morris, Eddie Spears and Fred Melamed. What floored me and made the film stuck in my mind so much is the sheer lack of phoning it in or cutting corners by anyone involved. When I heard about this project I was stoked, but had worries that it would get mired in genre convention and cheap schlocky thrills. Boy was I wrong. The cave dwelling natives are absolutely terrifying, chalky white brutes that come stomping around a corner to bury a crude bone made weapon in your skull before you even realize they're there. There's a particular scene, and you'll know what I'm talking about, that's just about as disturbing as horror gets, in it's unflinching refusal to do anything by the book or show anything offscreen. When I hear 'horror western' I get a certain picture in my head, a heightened sense of style, jump scares, etc. But this one subverts that expected route and in forging it's own special aesthetic, becomes all the more horrifying and memorable.",Bone Tomahawk

The film is quite gritty and violent. However, if you compare this to other cannibal films(Cannibal Holocaust, Cannibal Ferox), the gore level is milder by comparison. What is more important is this is a very well crafted film with outstanding performances, excellent dialogue and good development of characters and story. Bone Tomahawk shows exactly how harsh the untamed American frontier can be. The film looks awesome with great cinematography and as much as this is a rugged western it also is a tale of terror, built on tension and suspense.

Russell has a well weathered charm and personal presence that fits beautifully into Bone Tomahawk, a survivalist horror, in a Western setting. Indeed, the full cast of Bone Tomahawk hand in above average performances, that make this film work. This is in spite of the films rather constrained storyline which see's most of the horror aspects, squeezed into the last quarter of the film. This is a shame too, as there is, on balance, so much to like about this film. Looking beyond the quality acting, the sets are good, the premise sound and the horror elements quite shocking. Its worth noting, for some people, the last of these, the horror elements, may also be a negative. Some of the horror scenes are graphic and at times, rather cruel. For myself I liked this film but did feel a little let down by the storyline and, yes, I did feel the violence could have been taken down a notch or two, without reducing the films impact. That said, this film is by no means a slouch and is worth your attention if you like horror films that are a little different. Seven out of ten from me.",Bone Tomahawk

There are some great performances from Kurt Russell , Matthew Fox and the underrated Patrick Wilson and they all help make this a nerve jangling ride full of blood curdling scenes from the very start.

A classic western purist probably can't see how good the western elements are for the horror part. It's just as intended though so if you can ""get on board"" with the original slant, the unique horror, there's lots to like.The budget is said to be minimal, but the wild west is created expertly within whatever constraints that may entail. You never feel you're not in a forsaken 1800's situation in the unforgiving surroundings - in which the town of New Hope is carving a rough, but civilized, existence. This is important because it's the difference between the upright, the criminal elements, and the wholly mutant micro clan of pre-historics who make it so unusual. It's a fantastic conundrum of humanity played out with flair.Besides the left turn of cannibalistic horror there's a A-list cast with Kurt Russell hitting on all cylinders. Then there's Patrick Wilson who you may know from his Lou character on Fargo. He is side by side in the excellence department with Russell here. Perhaps the biggest surprise is the role of Chicory, the ""backup"" deputy, so wonderfully played by Richard Jenkins. Jenkins has been seen literally a hundred times, but never like this! I'd say the director/writer, Craig Zahler, hit a home run with his story as realized by this cast. No, it's not a classic western, but it is what it is meant to be which is quite an original horror flick, and highly entertaining.",Bone Tomahawk
64,robertemerald,Competent Western,7,10 November 2018,"I'd love to give this movie more stars, but alas it was overly long, and for well over the first hour very little actually happened. If you like Westerns however, then this is a very good one, and you'll quickly fall in love with the Sheriff and his homely side-kick, and well as the town's dandy and many other characters, not least the renegade Indians and their fantastic attire. The dialogue is terrific and perfect for a Western, and for that reason alone this movie will easily survive into the future.",Bone Tomahawk
65,Samiam3,Passable western/horror film. Needs more substance and less scenery,6,1 June 2017,"A marshall (Kurt Russell), his deputy (Richard Jenkins), a doctor, and a gunslinger set off to rescue two people who have been abducted by a tribe of cannibalistic mountain men.Like Russell's beard, Bone Tomahawk in is dire need of a trim. Here is a movie that is comprised not so much of scenes, but of space between the scenes; a lot of dead air in the wilderness. Curiously, there are times when this works to the films advantage. In an era where movies (both indie and Hollywood) feel like they are getting shorter, the sight of a Kurosawa paced movie has a way of drawing you in. All around, the acting style is appreciably realistic in a historically mannered way. The problem is that the closer the characters get towards conflict and peril, their levels of composure become increasingly hard to swallow. With his mix of geriatric wisdom and whim, Richard Jenkins is the standout performance in the movie.After an overlong trek across a barren frontier landscape, we climax in the lions den. The last scenes, which take place in a cave that is clearly a film set, are flat and anticlimactic. To be sure, the mountain men are genuine creeps. The movie neglects to show that they have domesticated horses, which begs a curious question. Why, if they are cannibals, do they live way up in the mountains where civilized food is a long walk from home.Bone Tomahawk deserves credit for merging western and horror without depending on gimmicks from either genre. In between the long spaces there are some moments of creepiness and competent writing, but the running time is criminally overlong.",Bone Tomahawk

69,begob,Horror or propaganda?,5,26 November 2015,"After a band of inbred cannibals abducts his wife from a sleepy town on the Wild West frontier, an injured man joins a rag tag posse as it mounts a rescue mission in the wilderness.Hmmm. Very watchable, but so confused. Opening scene has a vicious slaughter that promises extreme horror. Then we're introduced to the townsfolk, but the dialogue is self-consciously formal - although without pompous speeches to slow the pace - and yet the characters are endearing and well played by the actors. But still there's an overall feel of prejudice and that what we're seeing is a cartoon story that doesn't bother with credible motivations. I dunno - guess I'll have to watch it again and see if it settles in for me.Huge run time, and it's obvious that although nobody talks at length many scenes could have been tightened up without losing the charm of the dialogue. Many implausibilities - why was the wife abducted, why is the journey five days, why is the hero carrying such a serious injury so impossibly, why is the cannibal chewing on an uncooked leg like a chicken drumstick? The big problem is there's hardly any myth created for the baddies, and when we get to them they're almost as simplistic as those mud people who used to emerge from the walls in the old Flash Gordon TV episodes. There's an interesting plot point to do with two pregnant women, but it passes by almost without comment. At that point the dialogue has lost its charm and the actors are having trouble finishing the story with conviction.Another oddity is the music. It plays over the intro credits, then ... nothing until a short burst of sorrowful violin at 45 mins, then ... nothing until the end credits. And what we get is a strange song written/performed by the director/writer that plainly presents a bit of propaganda for pre-enlightenment virtue v savagery. Add in the earnest nod to Christianity and the animal portrayal of the baddies (including the ancient slur about troglodytes), and it leaves a bad taste.At least the disembowelling is good, but that and the opening slaughter were the only bits of horror for me.Overall, interesting characters well performed, but needed to be clear about the threat.",Bone Tomahawk
70,mhorg2018,Worthless,1,18 February 2016,"I don't know how this got so many good reviews. This was a terrible western/horror mishmash. It started out dull and never really got any better. It seems that whoever did this just took a bunch of ideas, threw them in a blender and simply made a story. While the acting is for the most, decent, the story itself and the entire idea of cannibalistic troglodytes (did someone see Cannibal Feroux too many times?) living in the west is at best silly, at worst stupid. Adding to the misery of sitting through this, much of it was filmed in the dark! How I sat through this without turning it off is beyond me. It was as bad as anything on the Syfy channel from the Asylum.",Bone Tomahawk

72,areatw,Unique Western horror hindered by the running time,7,25 April 2017,"'Bone Tomahawk' is a rare mix of the Western and horror genres that, for the most part, works really well. The first half of the film is generally low key and slow moving as we get to know the characters and plot, with the second half containing most of the horror elements, including some very graphic violence.My only issue with 'Bone Tomahawk' is it's running length, which to me felt unnecessarily long. There are parts in the middle of the film that contribute nothing to the plot and could have easily been cut down. Two and a half hour films aren't that rare these days, but I felt the long running time contributed nothing to this film. In fact, it probably hindered it.Overall, 'Bone Tomahawk' is an original and very well-made blend of the Western/horror genres. It's enjoyable as it is, but a more sensible running length and I would probably liked it even more.",Bone Tomahawk

74,carbuff,"Solid, brutal, and possibly unique mash-up of traditional Western and traditional horror",7,24 December 2020,"""Bone Tomahawk"" is a unique film as far as I'm aware, being a Western/Horror combo. You might think that this might make for an odd mix, and it does, but it works well as long as you can accept the somewhat languid pace associated with traditional Westerns, as opposed to the quicker pace that normally accompanies a horror flick.Neither the Western or the horror elements are original, but put together they make a new and different kind of stew. You need to accept the somewhat slow pace to enjoy this film (if enjoy is the right word). For me it was very effective at slowly building suspense all the way to the end, at which point you are truly confronted with some horrific scenes. Let's just say that there's tons of foreplay preceding the climax, at which point it might be too much for some people's stomachs. Due to these ending scenes this film seems to have adversely affected my sleep and still bothers me a day later when I think about it. Frankly, for those that stick it out, ""Bone Tomahawk"" might even be the last straw that flips a few viewers into becoming vegetarians. I just thought that this warning should be tossed out before you commit two hours of your time.",Bone Tomahawk
75,abisio,"Slow paced, poorly written western with a few interesting idea never fully developed",3,28 October 2015,"Mr. Zahler must be very beloved person. How he was able to get a bunch of good actors Kurt Russel, Mathew Fox, Richard Jenkins,Patrick Wilson, Lili Wilson involved in this poorly written and directed movie and even get cameos of cameos from David Arquette, Sid Haig, Sean Young, Michael Pare and others; is perhaps almost as difficult to answer as the meaning of life. Do you think could it be for money ?. Well; I hope not; for the sake of some of those actors. There is no character development in the movie; unless you count on monologue by each actor talking about his demons. Only Jenkins is able to create a one; and unbearable non stop chatting old man that after you few minutes is missed when is not on screen. The rest is just part of the scenery.What Zahler was trying to achieve is beyond my understanding. Leone is not; there is little wide angle and backgrounds are poorly lightened. Neither Tarantino; dialog between characters is almost non-existent (aside for Jenkins who never stop talking). Ford; not even close; his techniques were far more advanced (and risky) than anything showing here. Perhaps a couple of hints from Deodato (on the gore part) but Cannibal Holocaust is not.A brief talk about the story. For reasons not clearly explained (perhaps planning a big barbecue); a bunch of Cannibal (antropophagy) natives attack a small Far West town kidnapping two men and a women and killing a an African American kid (""Indians do not eat Black people "" explain one character; ""are they poisonous ?"" ask another character ).The sheriff; his very old deputy; the woman's husband and another guy that has nothing better to do but likes to kill indians; march for about five days (one hour in the movie that feels more or less the same) to rescue and take the opportunity to show their souls via monologues or some forced questions. Finally we get to expected confrontation which has a few moments is really disappointing.There is a few things somewhat unexpected; for example none of the four heroes seems to ever been in the dessert in a long trip. They say a lot of important things but facts shows their are really inept.A few gory scenes; one of them beyond what you usually see in this days; a killing and later chopping of one of the characters that will require a strong stomach to bear. If you are into that; that scene will not disappoint. The previous 105 minutes will, but you can take a nap; as I said almost nobody talks too much here.",Bone Tomahawk

Little action, little horror.",7,25 October 2015,"This right here probably was intended to be more of a movie than a horror, with great actors, dialogue, surroundings, all western, all old and respectful to those times.But this is not the reason I downloaded it and decided to give it a go. I wanted to see a horror, like I've seen some good western ones, ""Dead Birds"" and ""The burrowers"" being a few examples that worked just fine for me. Bone Tomahawk is more related to ""Ravenous"", cause it does have that classic look all over it. It just takes so much for something to happen, that at times, you do lose your patience.So, if you're into a horror mood, this will probably disappoint, unless you are seriously mind opened about the genre, and you adopt its any form. If you want to see a good movie that slips into the horror type, this will do the trick.Cheers!",Bone Tomahawk

Granted the first half of this film strongly resembles a western with a team of cowboys out on a mission to rescue some people who've been kidnapped. But once they actually meet their opponents, the picture takes a sharp turn away from typical westerns.Just because it's a lower budget indie film doesn't seem to stop Bone Tomahawk at all from being a quality picture.

But then the story ramps up and Kurt Russel enters the film and from that point on there is nothing dull or under-delivered. The violence starts off a little over the top but more hinted at or slightly shown, but by the last 3rd it is insane, cringing, screaming out kind of violence while never loosing site of the story, it's characters or the pacing.

82,DareDevilKid,John Ford's Wild West Encounters Wes Craven's Horrors,8,19 December 2015,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.8/5 starsOn the list of things the world needs, a mash-up of ""The Searchers"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"" is pretty far down there. But if there was going to be such a thing, the smartly cast and well-crafted ""Bone Tomahawk"" fits the bill nicely. A witty fusion of western, horror, and comedy that gallops to its own beat - ""Bone Tomahawk's"" peculiar genre- blend won't be for everyone, but its gripping performances and a slow- burning story should satisfy those in search of something different. The rewarding western elements transition smoothly into the world of horror, like the sun moving behind a cloud; and yeah, things get dark and startlingly violent.S. Craig Zahler's directorial debut is set in the frontier lands - not just between civilization and savagery some time after America's Civil War, but also between oater heroics (and antiheroics), Coen- esque clusterfuckery, and a pioneering form of horror. It's a western that's also a comedy until the good humor runs out and what's left turns into a grim horror film. And for all its grim, grotesque leanings, the film smartly steers away from despondency; the story and characterization genuinely fears for its protagonists' lives while still holding legitimate hope that they're smart enough and tough enough to emerge out the other side intact. Also, though its cult-movie desires often show, ""Bone Tomahawk"" is ultimately sold by its cast, who commit fully to Zahler's discursive indulgences.All in all, the movie is a strong directorial debut, and one of the year's most unique genre films - a neo-cannibalistic-western-horror with deliberately paced old-school cowboy elements paying homage to auteurs from John Ford to Howard Hawks.",Bone Tomahawk
83,bregund,Way too long,4,12 February 2016,"Someone should have used a tomahawk to chop an hour off this film, it's that long. Somehow without any of its citizens realizing it, a group of subhumans breezes into a small town and kidnaps three people, all without making a sound. One wonders what the subhumans have been eating all this time, since they've never been a problem with the town before, but this is never explained. After the initial ruckus, the film devolves into a lethargic, plodding character study as the rescuers head into the wilderness to retrieve the victims. What follows is an hour of bickering in the desert, exactly like a bunch of catty homosexuals on holiday, punctuated by Patrick Wilson's bad acting.Despite the stultifying character development, there is one bright spot: the opening scene with Sid Haig and David Arquette is delightful in its ghastly simplicity; these two characters should get their own film.The film's apparently limited budget shows in the unrealistic-looking walls of the cave, as well as the fire pit, which looks like a prop from a stage play. I couldn't figure out how the hobbled man climbed the side of the mountain or how he instinctively knew about the whistle-bone in the Indian's throat. More than that, a film has to mean something or convey a message, and the message here is concealed under layers and layers of meaningless character development. The ending hints at what should be an equally tiresome sequel. I can tell from the witty dialogue that this must have been an entertaining book, but some books don't translate very well to film. I used to believe that people in general were hard to please, but some reviews labeling this film a ""masterpiece"" have certainly proved me wrong.",Bone Tomahawk

I didn't care for any of the characters, I was bored to tears, and I resented the filmmakers for trying to sell utter boredom as a kind of moody, slow-paced character exploration and build-up of suspense. It was just awful. Kurt Russel is great, but he doesn't get to do anything really. He's just being Kurt Russel, though in a sedated version, with no memorable lines. He also kind of sucks during action scenes - which are very few, and boring (and confusing) like the rest of the film. Why is this thing over two hours long? And why was it even made?

85,PyroSikTh,Expertly Written yet Disturbingly Gory,8,13 November 2017,"Bone Tomahawk is a steady mix of Western and Horror smooshed together seamlessly. It has all the usual Western tropes, albeit reduced to their simplest and most realistic, but also adds in significant enough moments of gore and cannibalism to stick with you long after the film has ended. It's certainly not a film for the mainstream, which is probably why it coasted under the radar upon its release. It's a slow burn that takes the time to find humour, charm, and entertainment in the mundane. It's first act puts you right into late 1800s frontier America for the everyday civilian. Cowboys are literally just guys who heard cows, Sheriffs keep peace in a quiet town, bartenders struggle for custom, doctors tend to the sick and injured, and ex-military keep to themselves harbouring their own inner demons. Life is quiet and peaceful inside the town, but wild and dangerous outside.The film opens with a guy's throat being sliced open, but not in the typical Hollywood fashion of a quick cut and blood spurting everywhere. It's like slicing through meat and bone. This pretty much sets the tone of the whole movie. It prefers gritty realism to anything else, without glamourising anything, and also doesn't shy away from it's more graphic moments. When someone is brutally murdered, they're really, brutally murdered. Slicing, stabbing, guts and blood. Bone Tomahawk is not for the squeamish or faint of heart.But the realism also extends to frontier life. I've already mentioned how it portrays a quiet town in the off-season, and the every day civilians who inhabit it, but each character who gets focus is built in such a way that they're not just characters; they're believable personalities with backstorys, desires, and varying degrees of intelligence. The use of vocabulary alone not only transports us back to those times, but also speaks volumes to each character and their motivations.The acting is top-notch across the board. Kurt Russell is Kurt Russell. He just oozes screen presence just by being there, and his Sheriff is both smart and patient, with his heart in the right place, and an awareness for those around him that makes him both intuitive as a Sheriff and empathic to his fellow men, no questions asked. His back-up deputy is played by Richard Jenkins with a gentle naivety that's hard not to love. He's old and chatty, but isn't too smart. Yet Jenkins manages to breathe such life into him that he never feels like the joke of the film, even though he's by far the most humorous character. Patrick Wilson's cowboy Arthur is the everyman of the group, and his broken leg throughout puts him in a unique position not often seen in movies. He's in pain almost perpetually, and the only thing that keeps him going is his determination to rescue his wife. He's heroic in the least heroic way, with no grand feats, limited by his injury, and relying entirely on his smarts to outwit the cannibals.Honestly, for me though, Matthew Fox's Brooder is probably the most engaging and interesting character. He's ex-military with a chip on his shoulder brought on by a tragic backstory that's never made a big deal of. For all intents and purposes, he should be the unlikable dick, but instead Fox gives him a charm and worldliness that makes him oddly likable. He never drifts into antagonism despite often holding views and attitudes in opposition to the other three, and while his pride and vanity would make him unpleasant company, they instead give him an edge that puts him at odds with everyone else. Matthew Fox really can act, and do it really well. He offers a better performance than his more esteemed co-stars, and that says a lot considering the company.Bone Tomahawk also excels in it's more technical aspects as well. Sound design is extremely good, emphasising every moment, no matter how quiet, disturbing, or mundane. When a knife cuts into flesh, you can hear the piercing, the slicing, and bone grinding that takes place. When the wilderness is quiet, the subtle ambiance of birds and breeze gently caresses the background. The lack of a musical score (for the most part) gives these exceptional demonstrations of sound design a chance to be their own thing, and adds all kinds of suspense and intensity to moments that would otherwise be cheapened by music. When someone is suddenly hit with an arrow, phwomph. The unpredictability brought on by the lack of music adds so much.Bone Tomahawk was a wonderful surprise. I'm not sure I'm in a rush to watch it again, not because of that death scene, but because the second act felt like it dragged maybe a little too long. There's only so long watching a guy limping in pain in the wilderness is entertaining. However, at the very moment I started to feel bored, it changed direction and kicked it up a notch. I give Bone Tomahawk a solid 8/10 for it's fantastic writing, well-executed horror, and acting performances of a lifetime. Would recommend, at least once.",Bone Tomahawk

After checking out the first page or so of reviews here, my interest was further heightened. So, I, along with some family members, sat down for what I thought would be a gore-fest with an interesting story (perhaps something like Tarantino's ""From Dusk 'Til Dawn""). It started out promisingly enough, but then descended into an overly long, actionless, sometimes amusing but not nearly enough, trek across the west. We eventually started to fast-forward, looking for something interesting to happen, and finally came across such with about 40 or so minutes left in the film (when the group finally catches up with the protagonists). I think this could have easily been edited down to about 90 minutes, perhaps even less. The gore that did finally occur was well-done. My recommendation would be to watch the first half-hour or so, then fast-forward to the last 40 minutes. That should keep you awake and entertained.",Bone Tomahawk
87,ArchonCinemaReviews,Bone Tomahawk doesn't really capture the essence that causes horror or western audiences to swoon,7,5 November 2015,"A western-horror hybrid film made on an independent film budget is next to unheard of until now. Bone Tomahawk is a chill inducing film.Paying homage to the old westerns of the 1950's and 1960's, Bone Tomahawk is about an honest law abiding sheriff who embarks on a mission with his deputy, an injured cowboy and a gunslinger to rescue three people kidnapped, one of which is the town doctor and the cowboy's wife. What ensues is a journey akin to a John Ford epic, focused on the gore and savagery of that time.There is a scene in The Searchers that still strikes and petrifies me to this day. It is in the near beginning when Ethan Edwards (John Wayne) returns to his family's home and must inspect the damage done by the invading Comanches. Outside of the blazing home there is a shrouded hut, in it he discovers the fate of his beloved Martha, the horror of which beyond anything we can imagine. The camera stays outside the door, not daring to pass the threshold. His nephew clamors to see what is inside, using all his might to get past Ethan. Bone Tomahawk uses that moment, but instead lets you push past Ethan and bathe yourself in all the grotesque viciousness unleashed.Writer and director S. Craig Zahler uses much more than this moment to imitate a classic John Ford western. First there is the medley of characters, all of which have been clearly marked out by Ford films in the past. Then there is the way in which this motley group of characters band together, against horrible odds, to save their friends and loved ones from unspeakable evil. While on paper, Bone Tomahawk seems to fit the western bill, it misses the heart and soul we as an audience discovered along the journey with these characters and jumps right to a brutal conclusion.And what a barbaric conclusion it is. I am a horror buff who relishes in fictional carnage and I was squirming with all my might to not look away at the severity of the scenes. Most of the gore is contained within the final third of the film, and is highly advised against for the faint of heart, a warning I rarely make.As a hybrid film, it certainly fits in both milieus. It is also that which prevents it from shining in either. People watch westerns not for the gunslinging shoot-outs but because they yearn for the simpler time when there were strong sheriffs and gruff bad guys and a search for right or wrong. The characters were fully formed and interesting, a beacon of truth in self. People watch horrors because they want to be scared, they want to face that which terrifies them to their bones and feel the catharsis of surviving. Bone Tomahawk doesn't really do or have either of these things, but is daring nonetheless.As a first film, it is a commendable undertaking and accomplishment for S. Craig Zahler, especially on a budget of near minuscule size at $1.8 million. I wish the film had more of a core to it in regards to the characters and the group dynamic – and at 132 minutes, it had the time, just not the meritorious material.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",Bone Tomahawk

Their opponents are far savager than they could of imagined. A decent slow-burning western that descends into madness and gore in an unbelievably downbeat climax.

91,lathe-of-heaven,"An extremely odd film... An excellent premise that, sadly, was criminally wasted... Blu-ray: Good A:8 V:8",5,29 December 2015,"I was really looking forward to seeing this, not least because I REALLY like Kurt Russell, and he is NOT in very many films these days (BTW, I frigg'n loved 'THE ART OF THE STEAL'!)Believe me, I don't mind 'Slow', I don't mind 'Weird', I don't mind ambiguous, BUT... this film was just SO oddly paced and shot that I suppose that it just wasn't really what I expected or what I was hoping for. I really DID like the premise very much because it sounded like it was going to be a nice blend of Western and Horror which I really like. Even some of the REALLY Cheeeeezy films in that Genre, like Full Moon's 'OBLIVION' or 'GHOST TOWN' can be lots of fun. But, somehow I guess I was expecting more 'Style' or something. I truly didn't mind the 'Slow Burn' aspect at all, but to me anyway there just didn't seem to be much of an effort at ANY true mood or style what so ever. It's like everything that happened was just done in a matter-of-fact way in a steady, plodding style. In my lowly and wretched opinion, for most films to be entertaining or involving at all, regardless of Genre, it bloody HAS to have some frigg'n MOOD to it. And, this film ESPECIALLY if you are blending a Western with the genuinely weird potential Horror aspects of this creepy 'Lost primitive tribe' thing. I mean, GEEZ people! If this isn't absolutely ***THE*** perfect premise and setting to create a visceral, creepy mood through some bloody STYLE for God's sake, I sure don't know what is... But no... everything just plods along with this bland 'Sameness', that with the exception of some scattered sudden, brutal violence, there was absolutely NO variance in mood or pacing or tension. Nothing... I mean, yeah, there was SOME suspense as to whether these 'Things' would find and kill them, but not much else.I will admit that the odd touches of humour seemingly thrown in randomly throughout the film DID work to some degree. I liked that. But quite honestly, that and the rather creative premise were just about the ONLY things really going for this movie. I mean, everyone acted fine I guess; it's not like the director didn't bring out decent performances (which MANY times is the case) but, it's just that to me personally, he did absolutely NOTHING with it. Again, in my opinion, if he had taken the exact same premise and the exact same setting and just given the film some bloody STYLE... now THAT would have probably made it a GREAT film, if he had TRULY utilized the full potential of the good idea he had to work with. Actually, he did indeed throw in just two VERY brief things that I thought were great! And this is precisely what I am talking about that the film desperately needed more of. I won't give anything away, but there is a VERY neat touch that has to do with how this tribe communicates. The other really creepy and imaginative thing had to do with their women. These two touches were indeed frigg'n BRILLIANT! But, we are talking about a total of like maybe 2 minutes. Damn! The dude should have created a whole mesmerizing mythology for these people instead of spending 3/4 of the damn movie sitting around talking about bloody nothing!To me it adds up to what seems like a genuinely excellent premise, very good actors, a great idea, and then, BOOM... totally wasting the opportunity...THAT, my friends, is what I feel where the real crime is here...",Bone Tomahawk
92,peefyn,Fleshed out characters,8,19 November 2016,"If you are considering to watch this movie, do know that there are some very(!) graphic scenes of violence in it.Bone Tomahawk is a horror movie in a western setting, and works really well. The relationships are developed well in the first part of the movie, so that when the ""action"" begins, you have a real sense of dread, and you care about them. The villains are made into total monsters, though still feel like plausible beings in the universe that is established.This feels very much like a modern take of a western movie. The typical archetypes of the western are here, but they're all more human than than the black and white characters from the old westerns. The men are proud and act heroic, but they're also flawed in a very real sense. The women characters are limited by the setting (the old west), but the screen time they get is not gone to waste. It also manages to move away from the stereotypical native American savage, instead opting to separate the (fictional, stereotypical) savages from the native Americans.The graphic scenes I mentioned are indeed utterly terrible, but they do feel justified in the movie. They don't at all feel pornographic, like in certain other horror franchises, but rather an effective tool to stir up fear and anger in the audience.",Bone Tomahawk
93,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,"Wow! Disciplined, brutal, and fantastique!",9,18 January 2020,"What a film debut from S. Craig Zahler! I'd been meaning to check out his work for a few years but finally got to it this week while home sick with the flu. I started with Brawl In Cell Block 99 which was a far superior film to what I expected, and Bone Tomahawk is even better!The ONLY movie I can even compare this to is a 1999 film I am EXTREMELY fond of and that is Ravenous (which also features my favorite film score of all time). Both are hybrid films that combine cannibalism-related horror elements with those of a western period piece. It's kind of wild how both open with a scene featuring David Arquette as well - makes me wonder if Zahler is a Ravenous fan as well and cast Arquette as a nod to it. The primary difference between these two is that Ravenous is the quicker-paced, campier B-movie version, while Bone Tomahawk plays more like a slow-burning, Oscar-nom type of film...that is, until the last half hour!I'd always heard this movie was brutal and the people who told me were not wrong. In fact, one specific act of violence has to be the most disturbing one I have seen in quite some time, especially considering it looks and sounds so realistic. If graphic death makes you squeamish, you may want to close your eyes through a lot of this movie, or just skip it entirely, but you'll be missing out on a fantastic movie.Leads Kurt Russell and Patrick Wilson deliver their usual cadence and vibes but both fit the characters perfectly and carry the movie very well. It's supporting actor Richard Jenkins who truly shines the most though - putting him on the map as an A-grade actor. Matthew Fox was also brilliant! And, the writing is just phenomenal! Tension between characters is realistic and balanced, and there's just the right amount of dry humor that's surprisingly witty and relevant every time it's used.The movie is quite a bit slower than Cell Block 99 but it's well worth the build-up as you reach the vicious final act. I think the only downfall is that the tribesmen who are seemingly invincible throughout most of the movie seem a LITTLE too easy to ""manage"" in the later segments... but that's enough of a flaw to really taint this A-grade directorial debut. You can call me an S. Craig Zahler fan now.",Bone Tomahawk
94,jamiedarlow-37510,A gruesomely violent and extremely well written western horror,8,16 April 2020,"A few residents of the town of Bright Hope are abducted by a group of mysterious, cannibalistic cave dwellers. The Sheriff Hunt (Kurt Russell), his right hand man Chicory (Richard Jenkins) and a group of individuals with connections to those kidnapped go on a 5 day journey to the caves to save them. It's a purposefully slow paced film in the best way possible; it has full respect and time for its characters, ensuring you can get to know them as much as possible in the time given. It's through the carefully written script and great performances that the story is given such rich depth to it that you care about what happens to everyone, making the impending horror all the more disturbing. Russell is great as always as the Sheriff and Jenkins, a seriously underrated actor, is brilliant! Patrick Wilson gives his best performance to date as Arthur, whose wife is abducted and he goes on the most difficult journey of rescue as he suffers from a decaying leg. It's the impressive directorial debut of writer/director S. Craig Zahler (Brawl In Cell Block 99) who also co-scored the film; the mood and the atmosphere is so thick you could cut through it!

95,adrianovasconcelos,Unique Horror Western,8,1 September 2019,"The film's critiques were so harsh, and the trailer so odd that I promptly decided to give BONE TOMAHAWK a wide berth. In the end, I only went along because my son insisted I should see it, adding that it reminded him of a Tarantino film. To humor my boy, I went along and, as it turns out, I enjoyed it.Direction is really good for such a wayward project; acting, especially by Russell and Richard Jenkins, is excellent; cinematography and stunts are awesome; the script is uneven at times, but certainly gripping throughout; and it does not feel overlong, despite its 132 minutes. In fact, its length made me more aware of the characters' problems as they overcome various perils and obstacles.I did not care for the Tarantino-like gore, especially in the scenes in the mountain grotto, but that negative aspect is not enough seriously to diminish my considerable enjoyment watching BONE TOMAHAWK.",Bone Tomahawk
96,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Thrilling And Intense Western-Horror Film.",10,28 October 2015,"Bone Tomahawk is an excellent,thrilling and intense Western-Horror film that combines wonderful direction,a terrific cast,a great script and a fine score. All of those elements make Bone Tomahawk a solid movie that is genre film making at it's best.Set in the 1800s,Bone Tomahawk tells the story of four men,Sheriff Franklin Hunt(Kurt Russell),Arthur O'Dwyer(Patrick Wilson),John Brooder(Matthew Fox)and Chicory(Richard Jenkins)who are trying to tracking down people who were kidnapped and held captive by a group of Cannibal cave dwellers. Now,the four men are on a quest to get the kidnapped persons back at all costs on a journey none of them will forget.Bone Tomahawk is a terrific and memorable film that combines two genres that I love in the Western and Horror genres giving us the best of both worlds in a creative way that is fresh and thrilling. The movie also sees one of my all-time favorite actors the amazing and talented Kurt Russell in his first Western movie since the classic Tombstone in 1993 and it is a outstanding return to the Western genre. And while Bone Tomahawk has a style that won't appeal to everyone the movie it has enough gripping power that will keep audiences entertained and seems like a movie that will have Cult status. What writer-director S. Craig Zahler has done in his directorial debut is taking the genres the Western and Horror film and given Bone Tomahawk a novel approach that is very interesting,different and will keep audiences glued to the screen. With Bone Tomahawk we are taken on a journey through the Wild Wild West with Action,Adventure and style that is almost like a re-working of the brilliant John Wayne-John Ford Western classic The Searchers(1956)but is more violent and brutal as well as very intense and powerful never letting go of viewers from beginning to end. One of the main reasons that Bone Tomahawk is so great is that it's like two movies in one with the first 90 minutes being a slow build but compelling character driven story with getting us to know the four main characters whether it's the tough Sheriff Franklin Hunt,the injured but determined Arthur O'Dwyer,the charming and dandy John Brooder and the old but dependable Deputy Sheriff Chicory. All four of the main characters all have different personalities and are at each others throats most of the time but they are likable and have that one common goal of rescuing people who were kidnapped. When they go on their journey we as the viewer we are with each of them on their journey and relate to them well. The screenplay by S. Craig Zahler is fantastic,with Zahler giving the four main characters incredible dialog and some humorous moments that are funny,subtle and add to the film. While not Action packed the movie has a few good Western movie shootouts that are short but effective. I also like the photography by Benji Bakshi which makes the Western landscape look beautiful and visual stunning whether it's during the day or at night. So while the first half is character and dialog driven you will not be bored. It's the second half of the movie where the genre switches from Western to Horror and when the Horror aspect comes in the last 30-40 minutes of the film and it is dark,gruesome and vicious with scenes of blood and gore that is not for the weak at heart with one scene featuring one of the most brutal and cringe inducing kills I have ever seen on film and when you see it you will never forget it. I think it's because of the tone and genre of the first half that will make the switch more powerful and gripping. The ending of Bone Tomahawk is outstanding with Action and thrills and that will leave you excited and with a bittersweet feeling. A wonderful ending.The cast is great. Kurt Russell is excellent and at his best as Franklin Hunt,with Russell being tough and gritty. Patrick Wilson is terrific as Arthur O'Dwyer,an injured man. Matthew Fox is wonderful as John Brooder,a charismatic gunman. Richard Jenkins is fantastic as always as Chicory,the deputy sheriff. Lili Simmons is great and beautiful as Samantha O'Dwyer,Arthur's wife. Also,lookout for cameo appearances by David Arquette(Purvis),Sid Haig(Buddy),Kathryn Morris(Lorna Hunt)and Sean Young(Mrs. Porter)who give good performances as well.The direction by S. Craig Zahler is amazing,with Zahler always keeping the camera moving with a stylish and stunning look while keeping the film moving at a nice pace. Great direction,Zahler.The score by Jeff Herriott and S. Craig Zahler is impressive and effective and matches the tone of the film. Nice score,Herriott and Zahler.In final word,if you love Westerns and Horror films,I highly suggest you see Bone Tomahawk,an excellent,thrilling and intense Western-Horror film that you wont soon forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",Bone Tomahawk

98,Coffee_in_the_Clink,"""Say goodbye to my wife. I'll say hello to yours.""",9,4 May 2020,"""Bone Tomahawk"" is an absolutely savage horror/western hybrid that superbly juxtaposes the classic western with the goriest and nastiest horror. It's beautifully shot by debut director S. Craig Zahler. He captures the gorgeous cinematography that makes the traditional western and is uncompromising with the violence. It is unforgettable and some scenes will stay with you for a long time after. One scene in particular stands out to me as being one of the most gruesome and disturbing I've ever seen in a film. But the violence is not gratuitous, in spite of what some might claim. The violence is warranted, not only because Zahler is crossing a western with a horror, but also because in being so violent and gruesome the film authentically depicts the hardships and nastiness of frontier life at the end of the nineteenth century in the US.The cast are amazing, and the film is a slow-burner which allows us to get to know the characters very well. This also helps in creating the suspense as the characters travel across a barren frontier in search of their people who have been abducted by a ruthless indigenous tribe. In a film that has cult status written all over it, Kurt Russell does it yet again. In the tradition of his career high-points, Russell establishes himself as a memorable Western figure in his performance as Sheriff Hunt. The rambling but entertaining 'back-up deputy' Chicory is brilliantly played by Richard Jenkins. Possibly the best performance in the film, which is hard to pick, comes from Matthew Fox as John Brooder, a vain, cool-as-ice quick-shooter who claims to have killed more Indians than everyone else in the small frontier town of Bright Hope put together. Patrick Wilson and Lili Simmons are also very strong in their roles. ""Bone Tomahawk"" is now one of my all-time favourites. It is not only my favourite Western, but also one of the best horror films I've seen. The savage tribe are absolutely terrifying and uncompromisingly brutal. The make-up is amazing, the cinematography very effective. At the core of this film is a very modest attitude that only accentuates its greatness. To sum it up, ""Bone Tomahawk"" in juxtaposing two genres is the perfect Western and also a terrifying and gruesome horror that pulls no punches.",Bone Tomahawk

100,AndyVanScoyoc,Paid Reviews? Or did I watch a different film?,5,23 September 2019,"Horrible acting with the exception of Chicory (Richard Jenkins) and Brooder (Matthew Fox's finest work, I think) were STELLAR (one, convincing cool, calm and collected no matter the situation and the other, endearingly simple)...an absolutely ABYSMAL performance by Kurt Russell (it was like he didn't want to be in it and I can't blame him) and SOOOOO achingly slow and drudging, my husband, who loves Westerns, refused to finish watching it.I guess all the people whining about how brutal it was, don't know much about the old West.

101,Miles-10,A Gem of Its Genre,8,2 November 2017,"Horror and sci-fi can be overlapping sub-genres, and ""Bone Tomahawk"" seems an example of both. Outwardly, the film has a classic Western plot. Set in the 1890s in the southwestern part of the United States, it is about a sheriff and the posse he forms to track down a band of kidnappers and rescue their hostages, necessitating pursuit on horseback across seemingly endless plains. The horror/sci-fi twist is that the kidnappers, though nominally Native Americans, are a nameless, pasty-faced clan of mute cannibals who are cave-dwelling, barely human monsters. Other Native Americans fear them, describing them as ""inbreeds who rape and eat their own mothers."" (Also, they communicate by means of an eerie howling sound that is due to a primitive implant. In some ways, they are reminiscent of the Borg from ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" or, even more, the less orderly, marauding Reavers from ""Firefly"".)The Professor (Zahn McClarnon) who refuses to join the posse calls the clan ""troglodytes,"" a term that suggests a throwback. But they seem not to be a throwback to anything that ever actually existed. This clan of ""troglodytes"" rather seems to have opted out of humanity by collective choice, and perhaps they eat people precisely because they do not see themselves as people.The creation of the Trogs seems to be speculative anthropology. Whether such an outcast population might have existed after the official close of the frontier might strain credulity, but it is always claimed by advocates for the existence of hidden monsters that they are right under our complacently civilized noses.The captives include a murder suspect named Purvis (David Arquette), Sheriff's Deputy Nick (Evan Jonigkeit), and frontier medicine woman Samantha O'Dwyer (Lili Simmons), who is treating Purvis for a bullet wound and fever when the mysterious clan of Native Americans raids the local jail in the middle of the night. The posse consists of Sheriff Franklin Hunt (Kurt Russell); his ""back-up"" deputy, ""Chicory"" Kory (Richard Jenkins); Samantha's husband, Arthur O'Dwyer (Patrick Wilson); and egotistical adventurer John Brooder (Matthew Fox).Samantha O'Dwyer is not a shrinking victim but the town's fallback when the regular medical doctor is unavailable (drunk as usual). She is sharp and competent, and her medicine kit holds items that come in handy as the story progresses.Chicory is a man who is too old to be a regular deputy, but Sheriff Hunt respects his expertise as a Civil War veteran who has experience fighting, treating wounded, and just being observant. His great fault is that he talks way too much. Arthur, the husband of kidnapped Samantha, is a would-be cattle drive foreman, side-lined after he broke his leg in a DIY roofing mishap. He is an unassuming cowboy, a devout Catholic, who loves his wife deeply. (There is a funny, tender scene in which he reads out loud a letter he wrote to his wife that she rightly calls poetic, but when he stops reading he scoffs that it isn't poetic at all.)Arthur is not really well enough for the journey, and although he proves to be an asset, at first his broken leg seems obviously a hindrance and even a danger to the posse and its mission. Indeed, I can't understand why the sheriff agrees to let Arthur join the posse rather than locking him in jail for his own safety. Of course, one reason for taking him along is that too few other townspeople offer to join the posse. The posse consists of only four. There is no back-up plan. A telegram is sent only to ask for two deputies from another town to come and temporarily take over police duties while the sheriff is away.Director S. Craig Zahler seems to be making a career of authoring (writing and directing) good B movies with sharp images and amusing dialog. (Instead of telling Chicory to ""shut up"", Sheriff Hunt asks him whether he can ""close that aperture"".) Zahler also gives work to good actors who have been misused or underused in Hollywood. Here we have Kurt Russell showing perfect savvy and grit as the sheriff, and Matthew Fox as the egotistical gunslinger who describes himself as purely rational but who hates Native Americans and loves his horse with equally unreasoning passion, and Richard Jenkins as the colorful Chicory. (More recently, Zahler has given Vince Vaughn a strong starring role in ""Brawl in Cell Block 99"".)""Bone Tomahawk"" is not for the weak of stomach. What the cannibals do to their victims is gruesome. In one horrific scene the production undoubtedly spent a large chunk of the special effects budget to show a human being butchered by the Trogs.",Bone Tomahawk

When you have an unusual story to tell, it's best to find established actors who are always looking for ways to challenge themselves professionally. In this case there are few primary and secondary characters and what matters most is the story. There is a stubborn Patrick Wilson who wishes to win back his wife, even at the cost of the lives of valuable members of society. What happens next is an agonizing tale of hardship and much drama. The end offers us a little blood (not too much) and except for a moment where there is gore from the rest we can hardly rescue some blood. It is an intimate film where love and honor seem to triumph.

Craig Zahler certainly lets Bone Tomahawk take its time, but isn't afraid for the film twist into a deeply gruesome and engrossing Western. Kurt Russell and Patrick Wilson are both solid in this disturbing horror movie, using dreadful horror elements to make Bone Tomahawk quite unusual for a Western film. Although this movie can definitely be considered a slow-burn, it's also a possible cult-favourite and audiences who enjoy tension will surely appreciate the painful gore of this chilling story.The film's best component would have to be the interesting ideas and well-designed story, alongside a fantastic combination of western and horror segments. The acting is pretty recognisable as it fits into today's standard thrillers, but several portions of the performances and the plot will strand you on the edge of your seat and leave you there until the end.If you're an adventure fan who can take chilling gore and dreadful intensions, anyone would be able to recommend Bone Tomahawk for you! To be honest, the film is fairly a bit overlong, but the dialogue is amazing and the story is engaging.

104,TheRedDeath30,Possibly Most Over-hyped Horror Movie of the Year,6,9 January 2016,"Obviously, I am not a professional writer and no one pays me for reviews. Were I a professional writer there are certain things I would avoid avidly in my criticism, such as referring to myself in the review or referring to other reviews. I am not pretending to be a pro, so I have no problem with addressing these things. I am a huge horror fan and watch hundreds of independent horror films each year. I am a fan of westerns and have been since watching John Wayne movies with my dad during childhood. I have a fan of ""arty"" cinema and have a high tolerance for experimentation, slow burn films, and character development. Why is all of this important? Because I want to establish, early on, that I am not writing from the perspective of someone who came into this movie looking for TOMBSTONE meets THE CONJURING. I am an explorer of dark cinema and was looking for a great indie horror/ western mashup that so many reviews seems to prop up as the greatest horror film of the year. I left the movie, not so much disappointed, as underwhelmed.There isn't much plot exposition necessary. A thief on the run desecrates the burial ground of a group of pseudo-natives called Troglodytes. They chase him to a small, quiet town where they kidnap him, along with a pretty young nurse and a sheriff's deputy. The majority of this film constitutes four men on a rescue mission to save them. That ""mission"" is about 85% of the run time. This is most definitely not a movie about intros and climaxes, but about the journey to get there. That's where all of my issues with this movie lie. The movie runs about 2 hours and 15. I would guess that about 90 minutes of that run time is just the journey to get to their destination. I am not an impatient teenage horror noob. I do not expect constant action to keep my attention. In fact, if you go through my more than 100 reviews on this site I am usually a defender of the ""slow burn"", but there are certain things that I require. First is development and a well-defined introduction of character. The four main characters here are given a ton of space to breath in during this journey and this is, most definitely, an ""actor's movie"" where the actors get to inject full dimension into these characters. The problem is that we never get to know them in the first place. They could be anyone, anywhere. Kurt Russell was my main drawing point and ends up every generic sheriff in every western movie. Who is he? Why is he sheriff in this little town? We get a ""gentleman"" with no notion of what sort of business he run, only that he killed a lot of ""indians"". Why? How? Where? Nothing is ever developed enough. We spend so much time with these characters, but never really get to know them. The one exception is the Sheriff's backup deputy, who is a great character, with a the most backstory, but also probably the most cliché of the stock western characters here.Okay, so I've seen plenty of horror films that never develop character. I can get over that. Where does it lead me, then? To quality as ""slow burn"" should be slowly amping up the tension and drama until we reach a boiling point in the movie, a final crescendo to release that tension. In short, if I'm going to watch nothing happen for almost two hours, then it damn sure better lead to an awesome finale. There is no big payoff here, though. We get to a cave, we shoot some natives, we get one gory kill and we fizzle out with a few more natives killed in rapid succession. This is what I waited all this time for? I can't believe how many reviews are enamored of that one kill scene. Sure, it's pretty gruesome, but don't these people watch horror beyond THE PURGE or SINISTER? I see worse than that, or equal, every week in tons of other indie horror films. Maybe I'm just de-sensitized, but it takes more than that to impress me.If you really want a great movie about prehistoric creatures living in a cave, go watch THE DESCENT. It's a far better film that knows how to build tension and horror. I keep waiting for a truly great mashup of western and horror, as there are great examples in literature, but for some reason cinema hasn't seemed to figure out how to pull it off.",Bone Tomahawk

They must not get out much!).The dialog was not all that great either. Stilted. Lethargic. Lili Simmons (Samantha) has the best line in the entire movie. See the Quotes section.After all is said and done we are left with a Non-Ending. Truly insult to injury.Very good seasoned actors all; so I place the blame on the director for not giving this tale the pace it required; or the tension it deserved. He also wrote it so I blame him for the dreadful ending as well.",Bone Tomahawk
107,ivanmessimilos,Unusual but great western,8,24 May 2020,"I've been researching and watching westerns lately because of the specifics of the genre and I have to recommend this film. With one small remark, but about it a little later.
Given that this is the director's debut, the film deserves all the praise. Not much was even invested in this film so it remained somehow unknown.
The scenery is beautiful and truly true to the genre, the characters (the cast is great) deep enough dramatically and interestingly, and the plot is western simple, the characters go from point A to point B to save the maiden from trouble.
Then why a recommendation other than being a newer western? We come to the remark, and that is that this is also a horror, given that the said maiden was not kidnapped by some infamous gang but by a cannibalistic tribe. That's why I can understand people who won't like this film because it combines two seemingly incompatible genres, this is not a film for everyone. You just have to be a fan of both genres, western and horror. However, I can't find a big flaw in the film and it has very good praise from me.",Bone Tomahawk

Synopsis: A scumbag bad guy desecrates the sacred ground of a pagan cannibalistic tribe of indian cave dwellers and the indians (who, though portrayed as indians, look like white men) go out for revenge. They take hostages to eat as food from the town of Bright Hope, including the attractive (of course) wife of the star, and the rescue is on... The posse includes: Kurt Russell does a great job in his usual role as a hard charging tough good-guy; one member was disliked for being the smartest and most capable (most capable leaders are often dislike by lesser men out of jealously); and the star, who goes on the posse with a compound fracture of his right leg (Yeah, like this would really happen!). The star slows down the rescue, and when they finally leave him behind he preservers alone to save the day, even though he is inept in most regards, observation, tactical security, and alertness...

It's what you can expect of a kurt russell movie. You sort of know what you can expect, when you see they have David Arquette and Matthew Fox on the payroll. You don't really care for any of the characters,they are one dimensional anyway. The movie is way too long 2 hour and fifteen min,a B movie of this kind,shouldn't last longer than 90min 100 at the most.

111,gogoschka-1,"An almost classic Western with a fantastic cast, great dialog and gruesome horror elements",7,24 October 2015,"This film is a rather special genre-mix of classic Western themes and gory, insane B-movie horror elements. Films like the quite watchable The Burrowers (2008) and Dead Birds (2004) have mixed those ingredients before with some success, but while those two were undoubtedly B-movies, Bone Tomahawk never feels like your typical straight to VOD genre film.What really stands out right from the start is the writing: the precise dialog and never less than interesting characters are what really makes this film a winner in my book. The premise might not be very original - it's Western to the bone (pun intended) and very much in the tradition of great classics like The Searchers - but despite its dark themes, there is so much understated humour in Bone Tomahawk that I felt at times reminded of some of the characters in Jim Jarmusch's films. And Richard Jenkins' character, back-up deputy Chicory, is down-right hilarious. The acclaimed (and Oscar-nominated) actor clearly has a blast with his part, and the same can absolutely be said for the rest of the cast. This is a film that is willing to spend a very considerable part of its running time just building atmosphere and exploring the different characters, and the action/horror moments are actually few and far between. According to some recent interviews with the producers, the excellently written characters are also what drew A-list actors Kurt Russell and Patrick Wilson to the film, despite its micro-budget, and if Russell hadn't been so committed to playing the part of Sheriff Franklin Hunt, the film wouldn't have been made.In spite of its tiny budget, this is a quality film that really should have had a wide theatrical release; everything from the A-list cast to the excellent cinematography, sound and production design practically scream for the big screen. A word to the wise, though; after some initial mayhem, the film moves along at a very considerate pace (and at over two hours it's a rather long film), so for those who seek entertainment heavy on action with non-stop shoot-outs, gory thrills and scares, look elsewhere: this is probably not the film for you (and perhaps also not the film that was promised in the trailers). But if you like old-school Westerns with great characters (played by great character actors), great atmosphere and deadpan humour, and you ALSO don't mind (very!) gory thrills, scares and some bloody shoot-outs along the way, I believe you will enjoy this film very much.

I guess the pointless sex scene was there to try to give it an extra star, but it was so out of place and nonsensical that, unless you've a fascination with the actress (who is very beautiful, I'll admit), just adds to the tedium.I only gave this film 2 stars because I didn't fast forward or turn it off...

There is old west style humor and some oddities but then some things go seriously wrong. People are being murdered and kidnapped. The sheriff feels obligated to go after the criminals but is not sure what he is up against. A friendly native American looks at an arrow that was left behind and tells the sheriff those are people he would NEVER try to find, they are worse than barbaric. But sense of duty motivates the sheriff to ignore the warning and go after the kidnappers. For awhile the movie slows to a snails pace but that is for effect to emphasize the hardship of traveling in a harsh environment. Soon enough the searchers find the kidnappers and quickly come to regret their decision to seek them out. Those people are savage to the core, even worse than the Native American warned them about.I refuse to reveal any more because to do so would ruin the ending for you.

It's a bit sub-Tarantino in that regard, especially with what it thinks is cute characterizations and dialogue (sometimes good, sometimes OK). But these are really good actors working with fleshed out and interesting characters and it knows when to unleash the catharsis. You actually care about these guys and the violence hurts.

121,SpoilerAlertReviews,The most disturbing western I have ever seen...,9,31 December 2016,"An impressive directorial debut from writer S. Craig Zahler, who also wrote this gruesome, filthy western of how wild the west can really get. More so impressive that the whole film was shot in just 21 days. An outlaw drifter wanders into the town of Bright Hope unknowingly leading a tribe of savage, inbred, natives better known as Troglodytes which translates as Cave-dweller."" During the night, these horrific abominations murder and kidnap some of the town folk, one being the wife of a crippled rancher, who then embarks on a rescue mission with the town sheriff, his old and incapable deputy and an over confident gunslinger. Kurt Russell heads up the rescue posse as Sheriff Hunt, slipping comfortably into his western boots. Richard Jenkins plays his ageing deputy, Patrick Wilson the limping, desperate rancher and an impressive Matthew Fox who stole the screen, as the charismatic, narcissistic know-it- all who both annoying yet strangely likable, reminding me a little of Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday in Tombstone. There's an air of mystery for the majority of the film, keeping the audience on tender hooks waiting to see what's in store for the rescue party. Are the kidnapped still alive? Dead? Or worse? While some elements are left to your imagination, you can only think of the worse, but what isn't, is nothing short of disturbing.The gory violence is shocking to watch, even just hearing the graphic noises is enough. The sound is gruesome, bloody and unsettling. The climatic end was actually painful to watch, scarring the memory making me shudder just at the thought of it. The lack of a score only intensifies the haunting atmosphere. Something has to be said for the special effects, make-up and the sound engineering that were all completely on point. I've never seen a more gory western, even more so than The Hateful Eight. The makeup and effects throughout are amazing but they really go beyond during the epic climax. There's been a few disturbing films this year, visually, Neon Demon and imagination wise, Nocturnal Animals springing to mind but this one really made me wrench covering my mouth with both hands. It's like those good horrors you're too scared to watch but find yourself mesmerised to the screen regardless. This is certainly not one for the weak stomached. Kudos to director Zahler for created a stunning western with a difference, becoming borderline horror. Running Time: 7 The Cast: 9 Performance: 8 Direction: 8 Story: 9 Script: 7 Creativity: 9 Soundtrack: 9 Job Description: 10 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for the sound and graphic quality. 86% 9/10",Bone Tomahawk
122,Tehmeh,"Technically shoddy, but damn if it isn't brutal and straightforward!",7,4 August 2016,"I decided to visit my elderly mom, and take some of the western movies I recently bought with me, because she and her man sometimes like those. ""Bone Tomahawk"" was one of the movies they saw. It might have been a mistake. This is almost a B-movie. Not a funny B-movie, that much is clear, but a B-movie nonetheless. There is little to no subtlety, the characters are as simple as they come and everything seems to be handled without great ambition, but it clumsily does what it's supposed to do. It knows where it wants to go, and somehow it gets there, like one of the crippled main characters. And when it gets there, it finds its comfort zone and finally breaks out its guns. Suddenly there's an atmosphere, there's tension. In the end it turns into a pure horror movie with some very disturbing gore, and if you didn't give up on the movie already, you'll be rewarded. If you like horror and gore, that is. My mother didn't!If you're looking for quality cinema, this is not it. The picture quality and camera work is unstable at best. It's not horrible, but this does look like a TV movie. While some shots, along with lighting and the works were pretty good, some were just flat, badly shot and irritating. But once you start paying attention (and you will) to the sound department, oh boy. It seems like every noise is a BOOM. If a horse gently walks in the wilderness, it's BOOM BOOM BOOM. It's like they had over 9000 mics and decided to mic absolutely everything. If someone walks on an apartment floor, every floor board seems to have a mic on it. Every conceivable audible sound is not only there, but it's also loud. This could have been corrected during the mixing phase, but nope. The TV and surround we used while watching this movie weren't the best, but I doubt they are to blame for all of this. It's a low-budget movie, so some of these shortcomings are understandable.Anyway, despite the technical clumsiness, ""Bone Tomahawk"" is a simple movie in a good way. It knows what it wants to be, and there isn't an ounce of pretentiousness or even cynicism to be found. When everything is set up, it's straightforward all the way. People need to be rescued and some other...""people"" need to get killed. That's it.The cast is good and carries this film when needed. The characters are simple, and some of them are barely even characters, but the sheer presence of Kurt Russell certainly helps. He doesn't do anything special, but him just being there is an asset. Matthew Fox surprisingly was very entertaining, and Patrick Wilson is always likable. Richard Jenkins almost felt real, and if I didn't know better, I would have thought he ad-libbed most of his dialogue. Lili Simmons is certainly beautiful to look at, but she handles her role well enough otherwise too. David Arquette was a nice surprise. Nobody really steals the show, and there aren't many - if any - truly great moments of acting, but what we get is enough. Some of the writing for these people is good too; not too lofty or ambitious, but pretty mundane and at times sparse. For some this will come off as boring, but I welcomed it.I don't know what to say of Zahler, the writer/director of this film. I would have to see more of his works. His writing seems to be decent, and it certainly looks like he can handle simple, effective and shocking horror. It would be interesting to see what he could do with a bigger budget and a little more deeper story, who knows? At least the guy knew what he wanted to do, more or less accomplished it, and gave this film a satisfactory ending. Bonus points for ending the movie when the story ended, right that second. No aftermath, no hugs, no tears, just end. I always find it funny when that happens, because so many other movies don't know when to stop.Now, on to the real heroes of the film: the make-up department and practical special effects guys. The ""enemies"" in this movie (don't want to spoil it) are quite convincing at times, and in certain scenes very disturbing. There is one very gruesome scene in which the practical effects really shine. Sometimes it's easy to tell when it's just prosthetics, but nevertheless these things were handled very well. There's always a charm to practical effects. Thumbs up for these guys, they nailed it.To summarize, I found ""Bone Tomahawk"" to be somewhat poor on the surface, but it has a simple, charming heart resembling a really good B-movie. It seems to be aimed at a very specific audience. I went from almost giving up to actually liking it! If you want a quality western with amazing landscapes, terrific soundtrack, great shots and complex characters, look elsewhere. But if you like brutal, straightforward movies that pay off at the end, try this one. It might just be your weird cup of tea.",Bone Tomahawk

A tribe isolated without contact to modern civilisation...but they have good modern ropes.In the end this movie is not meat nor fish.

125,Condemned-Soul,A gripping western-horror hybrid filled with strong characterisation,9,16 July 2021,"Writer-director S. Craig Zahler proves his filmmaking instincts are on point in his debut feature. Yes his films are long and slow, but make no mistake, they are deliberately paced to allow the character work to shine through, which pays off later on.'Bone Tomahawk' is no exception, and the performances are excellent as well. Patrick Wilson and Kurt Russell are typically on form, while Richard Jenkins is outstanding, putting in arguably his finest performance to date. You'll be rooting for the group to survive every step of their journey into hostile territory.Even the music is expertly placed. You only hear it once or twice, but the first time is when the characters leave their home to engage the faraway savage enemy; a doom-laden piece that tells us death lies ahead, but for who?Speaking of death, fans of Zahler's work know he isn't shy when it comes to bloodshed, and this is no different. The violence is brutal, sometimes horrifyingly so, and the final act is as magnificent as it is merciless. The cannibal tribe even make unnatural sounds to match their unnatural behaviour, making this an upstanding horror as much as a solid western.Overall, this is a really efficient piece of filmmaking, and I look forward to what Zahler comes up with next. The writing is great, prizing character development over anything else to get the wheels of the story rolling, while the dread that builds over the two-hour runtime suitably ties a knot in your stomach heading into the final, gory showdown.9/10.",Bone Tomahawk

129,stonedraim,What has Kurt Russel been up to lately?,8,23 December 2015,"****May contain spoilers****That was my question beginning my journey to look it up and found...hey...what's this.... Bone Tomahawk? Hmmm..... let's check this one out, as I love Kurt Russel as an actor.As the movie started I were falling into comfort and just embracing the feeling of the whole thing. Then suddenly...what?! Oh....it is a adventure, drama... and HORROR movie.This movie is....well....in my opinion and experience, the movie this year that has really shook me up (and chocked me). For me so far the movie of the year, and I see a lot of movies. It has giving' me nightmares, to be up close and personal. The dialogue, the pace, the ""every day"" feeling with intense moments are great. So great it is in my opinion a nod and a flick to Quentin Tarantino. Some straight forward ""one-liners"" makes the movie just kicking it up even more. There is a sense of ""that typical Quentin Tarantino"" dialogue in here. The big, and the positive, difference is that there is just a touch. Instead of ""rambling on"" for 4-5 minutes about an social every day topic, there is just a little drop of that essence in here. One example; the vice sheriff is giving thanks to the sheriff more reminding him on his nightly ramble. Just a perfect touch of that innovative and formal written and acted dialogue and behaviour. Great... excellent!Throw some subtle and warm humour in there, and you got a nice little recipe for a movie. The moments of adventure, drama and ""gore-to-the-core"" horror plus the fact that the silence around the situations makes the whole movie come very close... so close that it creates a special emotion going down my spine.So....on the negative side, sometimes the movie becomes almost boring, in it's pace. At one time, I said to myself ""Now, something has to happen..."" And one minute later....boom! Another negative thing is that some things in the movie should have been more worked through, as there are moments that boggles the mind with; how...HOW could that be?"" If it were shorter, it would have been closing up to an even better review.So, to the question a lot of people is discussing and arguing about. Hateful 8 with Kurt Russel, or Bone Tomahawk also with Kurt Russel, made in the same year. For me, and many others, there is a clear winner. Yes, that is right, Mr. Tarantino. You have been beaten almost at your own game. Bone Tomahawk takes it home. All in all; Great acting, great producing, great directing........great...no, wait... awesome picture. I highly recommend it. And...as somebody else wrote... an instant cult classic.Over to the movie as a product: - Production: There is a lot of mistakes and small errors here and there, both in the story and in the production itself. How could a hand come off by a flying bone? How can toes be decapitated with a subtle blow of a tomahawk made of bones? How can a simple wedge in a straight forward direction keep two grown men from getting that out of place and escape? There are more things... and... this is almost always coming down as a approved thing in cult classic and great movies. Just watch Robocop, Terminator, Braveheart... the list goes on. These things keep the charming moments up and in place. - Actors: So I'll be damned if everyone is overlooked by certain prized and nominations, because you got it all in here. They deliver in that kind of solid trustworthy and authentic way that you will be shaken all up sitting there in the theatre of the sofa. - Entertainment: At times, I thought this would be one of the best movies I had seen in a long, long time. In a sense, it was. Afterwards, and still... like one year after having watched it, I still hold this motion picture close to me. The pure acting, the innovative story and the complete package is... astonishing! A cult classic. - Age: 18. Blood and guts, horror, gore and terrifying moments. Warning!8,5 out of 10.

I don't like Tarantino! There's a lot of talking. A lot. But the action, when it happens, is authentic and gruesome. It's classed as a horror western but it's just cowboys and Indians with conventional horror gore because it's about cannibals and on that front I wasn't disappointed.Kurt Russell is a natural as always and leads like the pro he is. His chemistry with Richard Jenkins was best, and Jenkins is barely recognisable but is solid as usual. Matthew Fox has impressed me lately with his character efforts and this tops it. He's right out of the frontier days. I can never fault Patrick Wilson either.The atmosphere seems to build on the fact that there's no music. None. Not even ambiance. It's like a constant sense of sinister awkwardness.That can also slow a movie down, though, especially when there's so much talking.My two main gripes are the beginning and the end.Stop giving David Arquette acting jobs. The first ten minutes sells the movie. You almost couldn't give this intro away. The cinematography was also lazy at times.The end is also too quick, so pointless, and ultimately sells the movie short. Some people like ambiguous endings. I used to, when the likes of John Carpenter could pull them off. I think everyone was eager to get home by the end, like the cast and crew.It's worth a watch.

Many folks have already given this film thorough and well-written ratings but I can't help but add my two cents.I am a HUGE fan of the Western and only lately have a grown more fond of horror, and to see these genres mashed up in a two-hour vehicle driven by one of my favorite casts in years, is must see cinema. The film by title and cover seems as if it should be straight to video material but is in fact high quality, edge-of-your-seat acting, writing and production.The premise is a group of men try to save a man's wife from a mysterious tribe of cannibals.Kurt Russell (with his incredible stache), Patrick Wilson, and Richard Jenkins are perfectly cast in the roles as the posse that comes together to save Wilson's wife from the cannibals. Matthew Fox is the actor I never knew I wanted in a western, and oh lawdy, does he need to do more! He taps into Val Kilmer's spirit of Doc Holiday from 1993's ""Tombstone"", rounding out the posse.The film never feels long while we are given moments of pure horror while wondering what the hell these mysterious cave-dwellers are all about. I can still here their sounds now!This is an amazing directorial debut from S. Craig Zahler. Who I hope returns down this road later in his career. 10/10",Bone Tomahawk
134,chrismackey1972,Fun movie,8,29 October 2015,"I thought this was an original movie. Kurt Russell and the rest of the cast really delivered. It had a lot of character development as well as action.If you like gruesome kills, they have a really gross one for you when the group gets to the cave. I won't give it away, but it's...nasty. lol I didn't know what to expect from this, but I watched it because I like Kurt Russell. This was better than I thought it was going to be. If you like a movie with good acting, character development and action, you should check out this movie. I recommend it. The creatures -- especially the echoing sound they made -- were really kinda scary. 8/10",Bone Tomahawk
135,MattBirk,A Strong Western with the Brutality of a Horror Film,8,12 November 2015,"Bone Tomahawk is about a small group of cowboys who set out in search of a group of cannibals who have kidnapped some of their townspeople, including the wife of one of the rough riders. It may sound similar to a lot of other westerns in the sense that it's a rescue story, which is somewhat true in the beginning. The first half of the movie is a great character drama as it follows the group of four for a few day and nights as they travel to their destination. This is where some people might have a problem with the film and the pacing might become an issue. During this time, we get expanded knowledge about the men involved and I found it rather entertaining because the route to their destination is just as dangerous as the destination itself. Yes, the movie could have been trimmed down by about 10-12 minutes, but it wasn't too slow that I lost interest (like many others I have read did).It is during this time where acting comes into play and, for the most part, it's all on point, especially Kurt Russell! To no surprise, he is the highlight of the movie and is no one to be trifled with. He gives a very gritty and convincing performance worthy of his filmography. As well as the three other gentlemen that ride along with him, they all hit their marks (even my boy Matthew Fox from LOST). The only real problem outside of the pacing is Lili Simmons' awkwardly dull performance (mostly during her captivity). Normally I wouldn't point out such a small characters performance but it was seriously lacking. It could be because her character was poorly written for the type of situation she was in. For example, why was she so relaxed and showing barely any emotion in such a frightening situation? Yes she could have broken down mentally but that doesn't let her off the hook. Also her line delivery was highly questionable and her overall performance felt like dead weight.But it is the final 45 minutes of the movie that will leave everyone talking. Bone Tomahawk explodes into the horror genre with its cannibalistic violence (is this the return of cannibalistic horror movies?). The action is swift, and I mean very swift, it really comes out of nowhere. And this was what I loved most about the movie, you know they are getting closer and closer to unprecedented evil but you aren't quite sure when or where they will strike. It's this trepidation that makes the final third of the movie so thrilling. They're clearly unprepared for the gauntlet that is waiting for them. I won't spoil anything but the movie really doesn't shy away from violence once they get to where they are going. Bone Tomahawk transcends from a slow moving western into a carnage fueled frenzy.",Bone Tomahawk
136,rabbitmoon,"Nice concept, but poorly paced and not as fulfilling as it could have been",7,8 November 2015,"This is one of those films that seems to have been written around one key idea - in this case towards the climax, involving some horrific cannibals. The whole pre-amble is a drawn out excuse to lead the audience to those far more engaging scenes. Its watchable enough, fairly well directed, and some nice moments, but on the whole it plods along like one of those less progressive episodes in a TV season. The middle act involving a horseback journey reminded me of 3:10 to Yuma but a little more boring. The last act is by far the best (it feels like the film actually begins at this point), but even that isn't done anywhere near as well and as gripping as it could have been. There are two gory moments, and the overall conclusion is still pretty unsatisfying. It feels like the writer/director didn't quite have the balls (or budget) to do justice to the idea, so dragged it out in to something duller.",Bone Tomahawk
137,Mr. OpEd,"Spoilers, hopefully warning you off this flick the way I'd wish I'd been",1,23 November 2015,"Spoilers, hopefully warning you off this flick the way I'd wish I'd been*Spoiler* *Spoiler* *Spoiler* *Spoiler*I rather enjoyed the first 3/4s of the movie. Yes, it could have used some trimming (Note to film makers, walking and talking and riding and talking and lying down and talking is only soooo interesting for so long), but it was intriguing enough, the dialog was clever enough, the acting good enough, and kudos to the low-level lighting that was so successfully used.I saw that this was supposed to be a horror western and that there was gore. But truth be told, even the opening sequence that is violent and a little bloody isn't too bad. We've all seen worse. There are a few action scenes, all well shot and edited, very pro, but they do not dwell on the violence. It's quick and over. The camera does dwell on the one young man who gets killed and gutted early, but it's dark. The worst part was I couldn't help thinking, ""Once again, the black guy gets it early."" The movie also pays some positive nods to Christianity and the then changing notions of tolerance and acceptance of the ""other."" Then (SPOILERS) our heroes are captured and forced to watch the gory butchering of a live human being. He's scalped, something sharp is forced down his throat, his genitals are hammered, and he is split down the middle and torn into. That was it. Turned it off, not only disgusted, but angry.Think of watching the Sound of Music and the last third turns into the original Texas Chainsaw Masacre. Scratch that, TCM was a great movie and you know going in what it was all about. There was no lulling you into thinking it was going to be a western with a bit of a grizzly twist. Why didn't the bandits they ran into show up half eaten along the way; something to prepare you for the complete cold cock to come? I don't mind gory movies, but torture porn, or gorenography is never something I want to see. It's not edifying.But the gorenography did something more, it made me question the rest of the movie. Why did the Cannibaltrogs leave the black man behind? They didn't like dark meat? Why did they only take a few towns people since they got in and out so stealthily? Why not take a few dozen? Heck, why not just set up shop in town? There's a perfectly good jail there to warehouse dinner. Also, they have no fear of firearms. Why aren't they using them? They know how to split a man's head with a tomahawk at about 20 yards, I would think modern rifles and pistols would catch their interest.Finally, the reaction of the captured wife when the sheriff is brought into the Cannibaltrogs's lair. ""I'm alive,"" said with about emotion as ordering dry toast. She's already seen what these things do to humans. She should be whimpering with fear, perhaps unable to say a word. This does not begin to ring true for actual human emotions.So, I'd give the first, longish part of the movie, the actual western, a 5, but the disgusting sucker punch dropped it to a solid 1.",Bone Tomahawk
138,untilnow99,My hands are still tingling and my heart is still thumping,10,1 August 2016,"Yeah! THAT'S what I'm talking' 'bout! I had a hankerin' to see a scary movie tonight. Completely by accident I found Bone Tomahawk. And because I never read reviews or blurbs which will spoil things for me, and because all I do (mostly) is go by the IMDb rating-----and maybe skim a few user reviews once in a great while---- it never occurred to me that what I'd be getting myself into was a supernatural, downright heart- palpitating and rivetingly horrifying WESTERN. I figured it would be one of your regular shoot 'em up Wyatt Earp type flicks. Boy, was I wrong, wrong, wrong.Now we all know Kurt Russell can do suspense (""Break Down"") and Patrick Wilson can be Mr. Super Scary (""Hard Candy"") . . .but who knew they could both be so wonderfully bad ass and exceptionally watchable in a horror film set in the Old West? I can't begin to express how awesomely satisfying it was to see them act in this spooky, creepy, frightening film. I wanted to hug them both and thank them, over and over, for such terrific acting.The entire cast is delicious. Matthew Fox, Richard Jenkins = awesome! You'll see what I mean. Sean Young being the only actor in this that seemed a bit out of place. Or maybe I just thought that because I recognized her right away and haven't really got over seeing some of her other terrible performances. Sorry, Sean. After Bladerunner, it was all downhill. (I guess you did o-kay in ""No Way Out,"" but that was 1987.)Honestly. You have GOT to see this film. As the end credits were rolling, my hands were still tingling and my heart was thumping.

Craig Zahler did a wonderful job crafting this film. It starts strong, builds character, and has incredible explosions of realistic violence.The acting is strong and the directing is excellent, and the effects are incredible. I have nothing but good things to say.One thing that may bother some people about this movie is the fact that the group of murderous savages are Native American. but this is countered early in the film when a Native American professor explains that this tribe is populated by troglodytes, ""No tribe claims these people, they're cave dwellers that would eat their own mothers.""

I am a huge western fan and Kurt Russell is one of my favorite actors, so I thought I would give it a shot. I was completely surprised that this turned out to be an intelligently written script, a story about a posse of 4 who set out to rescue a women and a young deputy who have been kidnapped by a cannibalistic Indian cave-dwellers. OK, the premise is a bit of a stretch in 1893-but the middle of the picture about the 4 on their rescue mission did somewhat remind me of ""The Searchers."" Kurt Russell is superb as the sheriff leading the posse, Richard Jenkins is Chicory, the other old and loyal deputy, Mathew Fox is Brooder, an experienced Indian fighter and Patrick Wilson is the badly wounded husband of the captured woman. It's a compelling story, the final .30 minutes does get exceptionally gory and horrifying. Some great dialogue in this script.",Bone Tomahawk
144,jckruize,Odd but interesting.,6,7 December 2015,"Film is an unusual combination of Western and horror, with the heroes tangling with a macabre tribe of cannibalistic native Americans (a fictional creation).Writer/Director S. Craig Zahler is to be commended both for his unique story and the way he was able to interest some notable actors to star in it under his own direction. Certainly the result is a rather odd cup of tea, not necessarily to the tastes of a broad audience, but there is a lot here to like or at least admire. Zahler's dialogue is deliberately idiosyncratic, with its formal cadences and unusual vocabulary choices, but it's in service to a rather plodding 'quest' storyline that builds to a rushed (albeit gruesome) finale.Along the way there are a few false steps. It's not a very suspenseful trek that the heroes make to rescue the townspeople abducted by the cannibals; the riding scenes (then walking after their horses are stolen) and bivouacs play out one after the other with little sense of pacing. In fact, their main function seems to be to pad out the film's running time.By the time the cannibals' lair has been discovered, the ensuing violence happens in discrete bursts of action with no build-up to a climax. Little enlightenment about the tribe, its origin and intentions, including whether there are enough survivors to remain a threat, is provided either visually or verbally.Performances by the cast, especially Kurt Russell as the sheriff and Richard Jenkins as his deputy, are an asset. However, Matthew Fox's character proves somewhat enigmatic and wooden. And Patrick Wilson, as the injured husband seeking to rescue his kidnapped wife, is okay but has done much more compelling work elsewhere.A couple of other minuses are the flat cinematography of mundane Southern California desert locations, and Zahler's apparent disinterest in close-ups. But the cannibals are pretty scary, and there's one spectacular prosthetic makeup effect like nothing I've ever seen.Overall, Zahler shows considerable promise as an off-the-beaten-path type of filmmaker, and viewers will probably want to keep an eye out for his next project.",Bone Tomahawk

147,kdavies-69347,Stunning performances!,8,10 December 2015,"Author Craig Zahler's directorial debut is a beautiful period piece set in the old west. I haven't enjoyed a western in quite a while... and this was an absolutely fantastic film!The story takes place in the town of Bright Hope, which for the most part is a small settlement not far from the Mexican border. Kurt Russell kicks the dust off his boots and returns as yet another western sheriff (not since he played Wyatt Earp in 'Tombstone'). Patrick Wilson, Richard Jenkins, and Mathew Fox come together to form a posse of lawmen looking to rescue Wilson's wife, the local town doctor, after being kidnapped by a native tribes-people of mythical nature.What really drew me in were the performances from each of the actors. Everybody brought something fantastic to the screen, and I was always surprised when I realized I forgot the name of a certain actor, and when I completely believed that they were someone else entirely. Kurt Russell does a fine job of portraying the duty bound Sheriff, but the real surprise for me was Richard Jenkins as the elderly Deputy. The way he changed so much of himself to really represent the age of the character, and the somewhat simple nature of the aged, just completely blew me away. I was captivated by his performance alongside so many other great actors.There are some very shocking scenes in this film, and a grit that seems all too real at times. A few of the gorier scenes seemed a little over the top with violence, but that seems to be the trend these days with other modern western titles focusing on violence rather than story. However there weren't too many of them, and they balanced the storyline well. A few of the more disgusting moments are saved till the end, and it begins to touch briefly on the horror genre, as you learn more about the kind of evil these men are up against. But overall there were some pretty fantastic moments of shock, blended in well in order to make a deeply moving piece of cinema.A great story, even better acting, and just a touch of madness, 'Bone Tomahawk' is not a film you want to miss.8/10",Bone Tomahawk

But the aspects Craig Zahler uses is very much unique and hard to find any other similar moves like this. There are long scenes, and the gores were just unputdownable. The camera is awesome. There are very beautiful wide shots of everywhere, even from the indoor shots. The editing is just apt. Specially the fight scenes near the climax, the editing techniques soothe our eyes.

I wasn't disappointed. Bone Tomohawk is a movie that has been vastly ignored and underrated for it's originality and quality. The acting performances are very good, and although it fulfills at times the clichés of a western it showcases an originality to the genre that is extremely welcome. For me, perhaps biased, Kurt Russell is the outstanding performer. His portrayal is terse and unflinching. The surprise in this movie is Matthew Fox. His performance is offbeat, slightly creepy and somewhat intriguing. In this movie the western genre is mixed with horror - to fantastic effect. It is otherworldly action that exists outside of the norm and is all the richer for it. There is plenty of action, and plenty of comforting camaraderie. The horror is an added bonus that gives this movie a unique feel. One that I have no doubt will be replicated in future.",Bone Tomahawk

The brutality and pacing are epic in representation, a very dreadful tone is administered almost immediately and doesn't let up and the fact that there is no musical score to augment the film increases the disturbing atmosphere by a large margin. The way the film was shot and the lighting specifically at night was exceptional. The casting is outstanding and praise to Matthew Fox for chewing the scenery throughout while Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson and Richard Jennings all give remarkable performances.

But this movie is TOO LONG ( 2h 12min length) and around the first hour and a half NOTHING HAPPENS but four guys tumbling in desert outdoors. Zahler should cut at least 45 mins. In my opinion he wrote and directed so well one of the nastiest and most violent deaths in cinema (Deputy Nick's) but the rest of the film is slow burn with simpleton characters played by renowned actors. Despite this movie is catalogued as Drama/Horror/Western, horror is 10% only. And that's the problem. Too many genres.",Bone Tomahawk

172,ryanmark-57919,A Fantastic Blend of Western and Horror,10,19 November 2015,"I had a feeling this was going to be an awesome movie when I saw the previews but this ended up surpassing all my expectations. This film is obviously a western but I didn't realize how much the movie would remind me of a horror flick. The two genres go together much better than I thought they would. Bone Tomahawk has managed to be both one of the best westerns I've seen in a while and one of the best horror movies. It really is so unique that I'm kind of disappointed I didn't get the chance to see it in theaters. It's even more impressive considering this is the directorial debut for S. Craig Zahler. Let's get to the story.The plot revolves around a group of men setting out after a group of what one Native American fellow refers to as Troglodytes. They're so vicious that the Native Americans considered them uncivilized. These Troglodytes have come to town chasing a murderer for damaging their burial grounds. The man in question was taken into custody by the local sheriff, Franklin Hunt (Kurt Russell) and his back up deputy, Chicory (Richard Jenkins). The Troglodytes kidnap the murderer as well as one of the town's doctors and one of Hunt's deputies. Hunt gathers a posse including the doctor's husband (Patrick Wilson), a former Indian hunter (Matthew Fox), and Chicory to find and rescue the captives.I knew Kurt Russell and his glorious beard were going to be in this film but I didn't realize just how much talent was willing to come and participate in a smaller film like this one. Russell does an excellent job as Sheriff Hunt and brings his usual gruffness to the role. He's a no-nonsense character that sets out to do his job even though he knows he probably won't come back from it. The other lead in this film is Arthur O'Dwyer played by Patrick Wilson. Another gruff character that sets out to rescue his wife but with a bit of a twist. O'Dwyer is injured and has to keep up with everyone while on crutches. Wilson is fantastic at portraying the pain his character is feeling, both emotionally and physically. The posse is rounded off by Jenkins' Chicory and Fox's John Brooder. Chicory is a bit of a talker that seems a little dense but possesses many talents useful to the rest of the group, like taking care of O'Dwyer's leg. Brooder is a bit of a dandy but is also a stone cold killer with questionable morals when it comes to strangers but is willing to give his life for others without a second thought. All of these actors do a fantastic job and their personalities are just different enough to make their conversations truly entertaining and unique.The desert has always had a kind of rugged beauty about it that many people can't see right at first. This film manages to both show us the beauty of the Wild West one minute and then immediately show us how truly terrifying the wilderness can be. The Troglodytes are menacing enough but seeing Wilson's character dragging his broken leg over miles of wilderness is a different kind of terror. Speaking of the Troglodytes, or cannibals or whatever you want to call them. these guys are so monstrous that it's easy to forget that they're actually humans. Their skin and voices have been altered in order to make them even more ghastly. Zahler did a fantastic job making them unique from what we usually think Indians are supposed to look and act like.I should probably note that this film definitely isn't for everyone. There's a lot more conversation between characters than there is action. It's more of a slow-burning type of western but the interactions are so good that it's hard to notice. There is definitely some action in the movie but not portrayed romantically at all and is probably a bit brutal for many people. There's one scene in particular that made me cringe a bit when I saw it and I don't cringe much. Like I said before, the film has a lot of horror elements to it so don't be surprised if you see something horrible.I can't recommend this movie enough. Great acting, unique twist on a standard western trope, and phenomenal cinematography makes this a very easy recommendation. Western and horror fans should find something to like about this one but if you don't have a strong stomach for violence then you might want to try something a little more traditional.",Bone Tomahawk
173,CtlAltDel,Different take on the genre,6,2 May 2020,"Westerns are my fav genre. I was intrigued to see this film, especially as it had a such a relatively high rating on IMDb.The gruesome scenes are indeed gruesome but I was expecting more gore - though I'm not a huge fan of gore - so it was a relief. But then I wondered if the film's high rating relies on it. If the gore was removed, would the film suffer? I think so. I think the gore pushes the film beyond your stock standard western movie. This is both good and bad. Remove the gruesome scenes and perhaps it's less of a movie.Performances are solid. Particularly from Richard Jenkins (who does his awkward, nervy shtick, which I like) and Matthew Fox. For a low budget film it looks good. Script is good with some great lines: 'For a man named Buddy you're not very friendly' (something like that).Certainly worth a watch, especially for lovers of westerns.",Bone Tomahawk
174,dieseldemon85,Not for everyone,5,9 May 2021,"I have seen many westerns both Italian, American made and usually enjoy some of the more underrated Euro westerns. Along enjoy with films of the Giallo genre, not too big on the American slasher. I thought this concept was interesting, usually westerns as well as Giallo's use atmospheric suspense or great soundtrack. Scenes had a good build up here, but found the soundtrack unmentionable and way too talkative, which alot of dialogue seemed unnecessary and or dull. The cripple coming in to cannibals territory and being like Rambo highly unlikely. One time watch, may have a cult like following in time.",Bone Tomahawk
175,TheBarleyGuy,"Well made, but problematic.",5,15 December 2015,"Remember westerns? No, no I wasn't born during their heyday either, but the story of cowboys and (vs) indians has become ubiquitous in Hollywood, and you could argue has even shaped our understanding of the history of the formation of both Canada and the United States. You could say that people aren't informed by film, but when you don't have a firm concept of history, why wouldn't you pull some influence from the pop culture around you? The portrayal of First Nations people in film as savages, and the constant referral to them as such, is something that we are all aware of, even if we don't particularly like western movies. The issue with this kind of story, in 2015, is that it always feel a bit uncomfortable and dated. The idealized version of the wild west is something that has absolutely not aged well, especially as more and more is learned about the treatment of First Nations people by Europeans during the colonization of North America, and more of that knowledge is fed into the mainstream. It's because of this that Bone Tomahawk made me pretty uncomfortable from start to finish, because it wasn't released years ago, but this year.Now, I know that many of you are thinking ""ITS AN HOMAGE TO CLASSIC WESTERRRRRNNNNNS GAAWWWDDDDD DON'T BE SUCH A PC SJW DBAG GODDDDDDDDDDD"", but the fact is, homage or not, the ideas and characterizations in this movie are pretty dated and bizarre to watch in a contemporary movie. Hell, the movie is even full of actors that I like, giving really solid performances, but you can't just ignore the parts about the movie that are uncomfortable, because doing that gives the green light to continue. As well, it's not as though this movie is doing anything new or interesting with the archetypes of a Western. It's a pretty standard story of ""good guys vs bad guys"" and the bad guys are ""savages"". There is an aboriginal character who is portrayed as pretty assimilated, and he is the ""good Indian"" in the movie, which is an uncomfortable character as well. They also introduce one black character, only to have him immediately shot and killed about 30 seconds after he is introduced, leaving us with a mostly white-male cast for the rest of the film.I mentioned actors that I liked, and I stand by that. The movie stars Kurt Russel (Death Proof) with a stunningly beautiful beard, and giving a dynamite performance as he always does, as well as Patrick Wilson (Insidious), who I generally enjoy as an actor. You also have Richard Jenkins (Cabin in the Woods), Matthew Fox (Lost), Sid Haig (The Devil's Rejects) and David Arquette (Scream). When it comes to the casting of the Native American characters, there is a casual nature to the way that they are cast, I found two actors in the credited cast who were Native American, or at least that I could find out were, but it seemed that casting them wasn't terribly important here, which is unfortunately pretty common for movies like this.As well as a pretty solid cast, you have a pretty good directorial effort by S. Craig Zahler, in his debut. He is also responsible for writing this, and previously wrote Asylum Blackout, which is one that I've heard good things about. It's clear that Zahler likes westerns, and has an understanding of how they work and what elements need to be included to make them work. He also works quite well with cinematographer Benji Bakshi (Comedy Bang Bang) and there's simply no denying that the movie is well shot, and competently made. With the exception of being substantially longer than it has any business being. At over 2 hours, it's really unclear as to why this needed to go on as long as it did. It could have worked a bit better with a trim of 40 or so minutes, because the time spent developing the characters isn't especially interesting. They are the stock characters of most westerns, and it's another thing that shows this isn't really trying anything new. With the exception of some weird and super obvious reused shots, the movie does work on a technical level.What I've seen in a lot of reviews is the praise given to the violence and intensity of the end of the film, while I'm not sure that the violence is anything more than we might be used to in any other horror movie, where this movie sets itself apart is in the lack of a soundtrack. With no soundtrack to punctuate EVERY SINGLE ACTION EVER, the violence is presented in a way that feels very matter-of-factly. Kind of like whenever someone dies in the wire, there's no ceremony about it, it's just done. There is some pretty brutal violence in the last act of the movie, though its nothing you won't be able to see if you got through Eli Roth's latest pile of sh*t.Ultimately what you have here is an overlong, outdated horror movie where the white guys win over the evil ""savages"" that has some gory or disturbing moments in the last 20 minutes. It's not a bad film, but it's also one that feels weird in 2015. It's competently made, but I have to wonder  why? Anyways, I had a lot more to say about this than I expected, so let me know what you though.WWW.BARLEYDOESHORROR.COM",Bone Tomahawk

She had clothes on for a few minutes at the start and at the end.It's impossible to take anything seriously in Bone Tomahawk after seeing her show on screen. She was hired just for the ""CINEMAX"" scene. They gave her actual dialogue and that was a huge misstep for the producers/directors (aka relatives of Lili). She couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag - and get this: she is supposed to be playing a DOCTOR. I kid you not.The movie suffers from a horrible 3rd act as well - it's like they ran out of ideas & money.

181,masonmorgan-92917,An excellent blend of two beloved genres,8,3 January 2017,"S. Craig Zahler's Bone Tomahawk is a generally obscure 2015 Western-Horror film. Yes, really. Western horror. It is truly a strange mix but Bone Tomahawk manages to be an excellent western film as well as excellent horror film, making this genre-jumper immensely entertaining and surprisingly smart. You would never expect anything like Bone Tomahawk to get made, but after viewing, you will want more.Bone Tomahawk features a talented, but somewhat B-list, cast with Kurt Russell and Patrick Wilson being the film's most recognizable frontrunners. Every actor involved here, however obscure, does a fantastic job. There was a constant sense of realism and honesty in every performance, making the entire film all the more involving. The main 4 characters that we follow throughout have great chemistry and share some interesting dialogue. While all playing cowboys, they each manage to generate their own distinct personalities and traits creating a strange, yet entertaining, chemistry between them all.Bone Tomahawk is a film that is almost guaranteed to stick with you for a while after viewing. Whether this is due to the horrific violence or it's quick changeup of genre, it is certainly an impressively audacious debut film from director Zahler. But it succeeds in it's goal of creating a unique mix of genres so well that the idea never comes off as irresponsible, but rather genuinely impressive. The film's subject matter was handled so well that even it's most bombastic ideas and aspects felt surprisingly mature. Our director seems to indulge in the extremely graphic and disturbing violence but never to the point where it feels unnecessary. It's surprisingly well handled and smart with it's subject matter when it could've easily been silly and juvenile. It's not quite enough to say that Bone Tomahawk is just underrated as the high quality and smart narrative make it a truly great film as well as under appreciated. The visceral scenes of action and violence adds to the unwavering sense of tension and unpredictability as we progress through the brilliantly unique and twisted story. Expertly crafted, relentlessly intense and full of character, Bone Tomahawk is a truly impressive debut feature from director Craig Zahler, whom I have high expectations for in the future as his obvious confidence behind the camera is much needed trait that many modern filmmakers lack.",Bone Tomahawk
182,derbo73,Well done,7,5 October 2016,"A well written and shot western with splatter elements. The setting and the acting were great, the characters interesting and the dialogue very entertaining. Good writing and gruesome more-than-human enemies. The only downside of this movie was the fact that it was way too long. Over long periods nothing really happens, all you see is four men traveling through the countryside - which is OK and well done, but the length of the movie is still tiresome. The ending is brutal and bloody, the gore factor is pretty high, I would not recommend it for people who are not used to watch hardcore stuff. The realism is rather high in all the dismembering going on, it's nothing silly looking that you can simply laugh at. Actually I found this unnecessarily brutal and explicit, the movie would have worked well with less details of intestines. Anyway, a refreshing and good movie.",Bone Tomahawk

Who could have imagined a Western . . . with Kurt . . . could contain scenes that are, frankly, disturbing . . . one in particular so bad that the viewer immediately wants to un-see it! Maybe I keep looking for Kurt's Wyatt Earp to re-appear, but not in ""The Hateful Eight"", also in 2015, and certainly not in ""Bone Tomahawk"" (2015) . . . what's with this 2015 beard thing? Kurt has no reason to hide behind a beard, it does nothing for his looks or his acting.Notwithstanding this awful prelude, and some other nags, the movie has some absolutely charming dialogue, with actor Richard Jenkins literally stealing the show as ""backup deputy"" Chicory. Not since Pea Eye Parker and Gus McCrae bantered back and forth in ""Lonesome Dove"" (1989) have I enjoyed so much the casual – often totally out of place – and humorous back and forth. In fact, the entire movie – with B-list actors (except Russell) - is well acted and a pleasure to watch – from an acting standpoint.A 6-rating because one point is deducted for bleak, dusty and boring photography, another point off for sound that is sometimes so mumbled that the wonderful lines are lost, and two whole points off for nearly senseless gore – no wonder the movie is not rated in the USA – it should be X-rated for the depravity and graphic gore alone! Some reviewers pan this movie for its slow and plodding pace . . . maybe so, but not for a true Western. Fans of the genre have come to revere Westerns for that very thing, the lingering looks at the Old West. Trouble is, this is not a Western, it is a horror movie set in the West.You've been warned. At least shut one eye and peek through your fingers.",Bone Tomahawk
185,Kolobos51,I hope this movie finds its audience.,8,29 October 2015,"Bone Tomahawk is one of the truest genre mashups horror has seen since From Dusk Till Dawn. As with that movie, the first half of this film is completely and unapologetically not a horror film.It begins as a true, unironically classic Western. It opens with David Arquette (Scream 1-4, Ravenous) and Sid Haig (The Devil's Rejects) as a pair of violent thieves that stumble across a murderous native tribe. Arquette's character escapes and makes his way to the frontier town of Bright Hope. Once there, he is promptly wounded and imprisoned by the Sheriff (Kurt Russell).Overnight, the tribe hunts him and abducts him along with a deputy and the pretty doctor (Lili Simmons, Banshee, True Detective) that was tending him. The Sheriff responds by raising the few men willing to hunt down these Troglodytes, cave dwelling subhumans that even other Native Americans consider undeveloped and monstrous, and hunting them down. The first half is a Western adventure story as the Sheriff, his over-the-hill Deputy (Richard Jenkins, Let Me In), the woman's injured husband (Patrick Wilson, Watchmen), and a bigoted retired soldier (Matthew Fox, Lost) track the Trogs across uncharted territory.In the second half, the s--t hits the fan and our heroes learn just how brutally violent this tribe really is. It includes one sequence of murder that is as graphic and hard to watch as anything in any recent horror film I can think of.I'll also say that the effects are outstanding and the movie's production values, while small in scale, are generally impressive and way above what you would expect given the movie's well publicized micro-budget (1.8 million). With the exception of Lili Simmons, who is badly out of her depth, the cast is great and first time director S. Craig Zahn shoots his own material with careful composition out of the John Ford school of filmmaking.What I like so much about this movie is it really gives a sense of what would happen if regular people just stumbled into a horror movie. The Sheriff and his posse are prepared for a gunfight, not to have to deal with a level of savagery right out The Hills Have Eyes. The movie is a little slow in the first half, as is the case with most westerns, but the payoff is worth it. Horror and Western fans should consider this movie a must. Film fans in general should at least give it a shot, as I would honestly say this is one of the best I've seen all year.",Bone Tomahawk

189,jmalmsten,Spartan and brutal. Kind of refreshing actually.,8,1 April 2019,"So, I saw Brawl in Cell Block 99 a few months ago. Mainly on a whim. Had no idea what kind of film it was until the violence really kicked my teeth out. So I looked around to see what else this director has had a hand in. Mainly Dragged Across Concrete, which is yet to be released here as far as I know, and this here Bone Tomahawk.So I now sat down to see if it would be in the same vein. And afterwards I can say yes. It is similar in tone and style. The look felt a little cheaper. Something about the lighting I guess. But the point in it isn't to be pretty. There are nice views but it isn't the point. The point is to tell an old school gut punching western. The kind that I've read about that's supposed to have been all the rage during right about the time the film is set. There is no frill. No hiding the ugly. And they barely got away with depicting native americans as unholy beasts by simply having a more regular indian in civilised clothes describe the villain tribe as troglodytes. Like Brawl it skates past on a razor sharp edge.In most eyes probably barely defendable. The dialog is gruff. The violence is ugly. The morals, even among the heroes, is described as unquestionable, simply because of the lack of it.And yet. Like Brawl. There's a brutal honesty to it. And I think at the halfway point, or thereabouts, I noticed that there haven't been any music. It is a sparse movie told with as little in the way of sugarcoating as they could manage. And in a movie landscape with so much excess in everything but the violence, to see one or two really double down on depicting the ugliness of it. It was kind of refreshing.Now I'm even more excited to see what Dragged Across Concrete can provide. Because I think this director is one to keep an eye on.",Bone Tomahawk
190,KissMyAss31193,Not bad.. but boring.,6,10 September 2018,"I didn't want to do that. I didn't want to dislike this film because I liked the premise and most of the execution. But god damn if it isn't an hour too long.
From the beginning I was absolutely astonished by the organic and natural feel of the direction. It hardly felt like written lines but characters expressing themselves. Perfect! Then as soon as the plot is revealed the movie starts dragging. There is actually a scene with a character describing the challenges of reading a book in a bathtub. And another character suggesting a table and towel. Why was this in the movie? Also the camera work was hardly impressive and kind of dull and uninspired. Another thing that really bothered me was the fact that this film thought it was so much better than it was. Wasting time with characters I couldn't find myself interested in at all. This certainly is a film that could have used a twist. After the first twenty minutes everything becomes unsurprising. The script was pretty good, with some actually good lines. Not enough to save it for me though.
It's really not a bad film. But basically a pointless one. As a film it gets a 7. As a piece of entertainment it get's a 4. Because I take film-making seriously it boils down to a score of 6 out of 10.

This film is an excellent western in its own right, but absolutely brutal in its horror elements that due to its nature, will reflect why certain people might not appreciate it initially. It starts off very quickly and you kind of know the sort of brutality you are in for, but this isn't a horror film in the sense of slasher elements from start to finish. Instead it introduces the characters brilliantly and follows their quest to find the kidnapped wife of one of the men, who has been taken by a bunch of cannibals. We are slowly involved in their hunt for the caves where these kidnappers live, but on route as with every western, they meet characters and all sorts of obstacles which are stopping them from achieving their mission. It has a stellar cast with Kurt Russell leading the pack and he is in brilliant form as per usual. A brutal, but excellent horror western that is well worth the watch.

193,Ben_Cap,A western starring Kurt Russell called Bone Tomahawk? Take my money.,7,25 January 2016,"Westerns seem to fall in and out of favor every few years and right now we are in the midst of a high period. The more well known westerns available right now, The Hateful Eight and The Revenant both take the genre and do something different with it. Bone Tomahawk is straight down the line western. It is a scenic and terrifying world where the only things that shine are the six shooters and retribution is taken in blood.At the head of the cast is the one, the only Kurt Russell. He so perfectly is this character that I became lost in his performance. Everything from the facial hair ooze old west sheriff and while this may not end up being his most well known role it very well may be his best. Matthew Fox is pleasantly surprisingly really good. I never thought he could pull off the slightly arrogant but mysteriously tough guy as well as he does here. Almost a complete 180 from his role on Lost. Richard Jenkins also plays out of role as a playfully foolish but strongly loyal old man. The rest of the cast is either not all that impressive or not on screen enough to garner mention but the leading 3 will be all you need to get through this movie.The movie is written, directed and composed by S. Craig Zahler who before this I had never heard of. Zahler certainly knows how to shoot a western as this is a stunningly beautiful looking movie. The budget is obviously smaller than most but Zahler makes up for it with some fantastic sunsets and expansive wasteland shots. While the movie looks great the real gem here is the writing. The screenplay is sharp and witty with more than a few lines that I have repeated several times. There is a fluidity and understanding of western lingo that helps to add to the realism that the movie strides for. It's not quite Tarantino Pulp Fiction smart but Zahler is on the right track as this is one of the best written movies I have seen in 2015.Bone Tomahawk eventually will blend genres about two thirds of the way through into a fairly intense horror movie. Not so much a visual horror movie but more psychological and suspenseful type of horror which I believe is always better. While not an overly gory movie there are some real tremendous moments of extreme pain suffered by the characters and you will feel that pain if you are watching intently.while not the most exciting movie of the year or the movie with the most movie stars, Bone Tomahawk is an entertaining western depiction. There was without a doubt a lot of care and knowledge that went into making this movie as realistic and as well made as possible. If slow dialogue filled movies with a fair amount of gore don't light your fire then stay away, but for the rest of us this is a western you should not ignore.",Bone Tomahawk
194,VOIIIXI,What an amazing film!,10,22 June 2020,"I should've I watched this movie sooner, I watched Zahler's Brawl in cell block 99 & Dragged Across concrete and I absolutely loved them. This kind of movie is the why watching movies is one of my favorite things in the world. The violence and horror is intense, it's absolutely disturbing. the characters are very interesting, the story is gripping, the pacing is excellent and of course the directing and cinematography is beautiful. Zahler has a unique way of making excellent, gripping and intense films, especially with the violence, it's very quick and shocking when you don't expect it, which I love. And the sound design is very real and very good. The shot composition is brilliant too. I also loved his other 2 films so much, and this one is his best one and surprisingly it was his first too. I cannot wait for what this director makes in the future. This is the type of movie that you sit all the way through with all kinds of emotions never feeling bored and waiting to see what happens, and in the end you sit there in awe. 10/10 a must watch.",Bone Tomahawk
195,mpurvismattp,Eh..It's basically the hills have eyes...in the west...with less action.,5,1 February 2016,"I think IMDb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to reviews. Lately though I'm beginning to wonder if I'm just not seeing good things in movies that others are or if its just coincidence. Either way I didn't agree with most on this film. It was decent, not horrible but just decent in my opinion. The movie felt a bit low budget but that's not were the criticism is. The acting was good, I wasn't really blown away by anyone's performance but the names involved certainly gave it some credit going in. They all did adequate jobs in this film, and to be fair there wasn't a whole lot to work with necessarily so that wasn't the issue either. I just thought this film lacked inspiration. People keep saying it's fresh and revolutionary or something along those lines but I gotta say I just don't see it. This movie had a few decent parts, a few brutal parts and that's essentially it. It was basically the Hills Have Eyes with cannibal Indians in the place of cannibal mutants. Bigger named actors and less action on a rehashed idea doesn't make a good film in my opinion. That's my thoughts anyway.",Bone Tomahawk
196,ChrisinDesMoines,"A good movie, great plot, but watching it once was more than enough",8,24 January 2021,"This movie was suggested to me and because I like westerns (as well as have yet to see a Kurt Russell movie I haven't liked) so I decided to check it out. As a Western genre film it starts off good and like most western movies you have a slow buildup to the climax, and I knew what I was getting into with this movie (cannibalism) but I've watched Hannibal and Silence of the Lambs so knew that there was going to be some disturbing scenes in it.While I wouldn't call this a ""slasher film"" per se, it's closely related. Several scenes will cause you to cringe and a couple are pretty graphic in nature.Actual plot is good and original with a great cast of actors, most of whom you realize look familiar but can't place them (I have a Plex Server and I can cross reference movies by actors which caused me to say ""That's where I saw him at!""). I've read that this is a pretty low budget movie, but you wouldn't know it.I'm just going to say it. This movie is difficult to watch unless you have a strong stomach. If you like horror/slasher movies, you might find this good. If you like suspense, you will be glued to the screen, but be prepared to turn it off and walk away for a while (I did). If you like Westerns, then I'll tell you straight up, you'll most likely like this. I watched it, I'm glad I did, but I don't think I'll be watching this again like I do with several other western flicks that I have.",Bone Tomahawk
197,alihandemiral,"With ""Bone Tomahawk"", Zahler creates a whole new sub-genre with great success.",10,10 October 2017,"Bone Tomahawk may be classified as a ""western gore-horror"" - probably the first of its kind, although the superficial plot - four cowboys going on a quest against cannibal Native Americans - is entertaining and original enough, the film is much more than that. The casting is remarkable, especially with Kurt Russell and Matthew Fox; the costume design and the setting does not fall short than the casting. Yet, what makes this movie a critical success is the fusion between the characters and the carefully crafted dialogue. The clever dialogue goes hand in hand with the slow-paced story of the film and enables it to reach to the climax with the action-packed last twenty minutes. The amount of gore in the film is set just right, finding that thin line between over-exaggeration and incompetence. As both a huge horror and spaghetti western fan, I may say ""Bone Tomahawk"" is one of the most original horror films I've ever seen; Zahler needs to get right back at shooting films!",Bone Tomahawk
198,peedur,What on earth... ?,2,16 January 2016,"Literally, a blending two genres. Only here it is without an attempt to determine how they might weaken each other. Other films like ""Apocalypto"" and ""The Revenant,"" make this attempt with greater success. It's about storytelling factors which prepare the audience for the places we are going.It looks and feels like a western - characters on the edge of civilization, good and evil motives laid bare, the struggle to establish civilized values in a hostile setting. The weird, albeit brief detour into gore that the film takes assumes certain horror qualities too. There is the focus on ghastly details which make us fearfully aware of our physical frailty, and ""monsters"" we encounter look like people, but also come very close to being portrayed as another species, which for me was a problem.The way these ideas are combined in Bone Tomahawk renders any theme incoherent or non-historic (problematic with westerns). The point the film might be making is that the natives occupying America when settlers moved west were more savage and inhuman that we could ever imagine or relate to. The reality is that ALL cultures have barbaric periods, almost disqualifying inclusion into humanity. Making native Americans appear monstrous without context automatically makes a point not supported by history, but which horror movies rely on and sharpen by contrast.Are we to believe that there were many such tribes? Is this a true story? Were these troglodyte cannibals typical, or a bizarre sociological anomaly? Ultimately the gore and graphic violence is shown without necessary context - horrific for it's own sake. It simply grabs the viewers' hair and forces them to witness a ghastly spectacle. We are left gazing at the equivalent of a graphic atrocity on the internet, without warning. Genre usually prepares us for the quality and tone of visual storytelling. I don't believe that the audience was prepared for what we were eventually led to see.This disconnect wrenched me out of the narrative.",Bone Tomahawk
199,ms_jade_li,Kurt Russell in heroic role in Western Horror Cult Classic,8,16 March 2016,"I recently saw The Hateful Eight, the latest Tarantino film, a western where Kurt Russell is one (of the 8). Browsing netflix, Kurt looking western again caught my eye, as did the title. Not really a fan of horror movies, I chose, Bone Tomahawk with some trepidation. However, knowing Kurt's filmography and reputation for quality films, I figured how graphic could it get.That said I was thrown somewhat off balance by several aspects of the film, but it's not a bad thing. First I noticed how quiet it was. There were no distracting soundtracks or sound effects other than natural sounds. This gives amplification to ordinary sounds. Kurt smacking his lips while sipping hot corn chowder. The bed creaking as a man has a lovemaking session with his wife. The piano player at his piano not playing. The clop clop of the horses walking. The quietness brings life to the dialogue. You listen to what is being said.Another thing I noticed is that there are no ""red shirts"" in this film. Everyone is important. At first, as the posse was headed out to rescue the hostages, the characters made comments that had me believing, OK this guy's going to be picked off first. Instead of the usual predictability of ""the evil"" picking people off one by one, the folks in the posse actually had conversation and got to know each other. For horror movies, this is highly unusual. It took a little shift in perspective to roll with it.One point of aggravation for me was the guy with the injured leg. I winced and grimaced right along with him. He did a good job of setting up dynamic tension under the general tension of wondering if their rescue would be successful and when evil would show its face.Another area where this film is non-formulaic is in its quantity and variety of gruesomeness. What it lacked in quantity it made up for in gruesomeness. I had to avert my eyes in a couple of places.Now to get to Kurt Russell's heroism. He's a small town sheriff but he's fearless every step of the way, from when the stranger who ""buried something out under the tree"" is confronted in the tavern, to the very end (no spoilers here). He's everyone's ideal of what a sheriff should be. He's fearless. He's fair. He's good to his wife. He's kind to his kinsmen. And he's not going to stop until he saves the imprisoned townsfolk.Bone Tomahawk is not your run of the mill film. It is extraordinary in several ways.",Bone Tomahawk

Oh My God! really???if you want to waste your time just to see Kurt Russell I can tell you that it is not worth the time. the ""old timer"" plays much better and is more interesting in the whole movie then Kurt Russel.if I could give this movie a rotten tomato... I would prefer to throw the tomato in the garbage. yeah... the movie was THAT bad, and even worse (in my humble opinion).some scenes are just there to make you feel happy you are a Christian.

202,LawnBoy-4,"Slow, plodding and features one of the most nauseating scenes I've witnessed",5,2 March 2020,"Having heard so many good things about this film and, wanting to watch something unique, I finally gave this a watch. I am actually sorry I did, mainly due to one scene - the infamous ""splitting"" scene, which I won't spoil, but will warn that, if you are in any way ""sensitive"" to gore, you REALLY need to avoid this scene. I've watched many great and/or gory horror films over the years (and I love a good twisted horror film), so I am hardly one to become repulsed easily. The scene in question nearly made me vomit on the spot and I can't get it out of my head. It was entirely unnecessary and obviously included only for the shock value. Even the most exploitative films and scenes need to exhibit a purpose beyond going for straight-up shock value and the execution of this scene failed miserably in that regard.That is all I will say about that.Regarding the overall film quality, I felt that it was poorly paced, though not nearly as ""slow"" as others have described. For the first 20-30 minutes, the film does plod along while unnecessarily dragging out certain scenes, but it levels off well enough for the remainder of the film. Still, the early poor pacing is noticeable enough so as to detract from the scenes in question. Many have criticized the run time, but I had no issue with it, the first 20-30 minutes notwithstanding.In terms of performances, Kurt Russell and Richard Jenkins were the obvious standouts, so much so that they prevented the film from constituting an absolute bust.Again, if you have a weak stomach, you will either need to avoid this film altogether or go to another room when the infamous scene occurs.",Bone Tomahawk

I say semi gory, because there was only a few gory parts, one I kinda cringed lol. The movie had some dry humor to it and of course the actors were all good in it. A lot of famous actors in one movie sometimes can make the movie seem like an acting competition, but this one was done ok most bigger actors had smaller parts, so it worked out.

To say it was 'limp' and just so lacking in either horror or western themes.Occasional violence and gore is no substitute for action or tension. Avoid this massive waste of 2 hours. Watch a decent western or a good horror, because this is a failure on both fronts.How on earth this sits at a 7 on IMDb is beyond me. Save yourself the trouble of reading all those ""9/10"" reviews.

205,julesfdelorme,Truly Original but brutal and very creepy,9,21 September 2017,"With Hallowe'en coming up, I thought I'd talk about Bone Tomahawk again. It's a surprisingly good contemporary Western, with clever, witty dialogue and interesting characters, reminiscent at times of the Coen Brothers version of True Grit. It might also be the only successful Western Horror film that I can think of. I may not have given the film its proper due the first time around. As much as I do love Classic Western movies, I don't want to get caught up in that assumption that we don't do anything as well as we did in the old days, as we so often do. One of the greatest Film Noirs in my opinion is Chinatown, which is neither from the time period that we associate with Noir or filmed in Black and White as we assume Noir is defined by. Similarly there have been some superb later era Westerns like Unforgiven or the superb remake of True Grit. There are also modern Westerns that are able to tell the story in more modern ways like Meek's Cutoff, giving us a more modern perspective on women in the West. Not everyone's cup of tea, but a superb film nonetheless. Bone Tomahawk falls into that latter category. The premise, of a small town posse that is forced to go out to rescue kidnapped friends and family from cave dwelling cannibals, makes the film as much a modern Gothic horror movie as it is a Western. Which leads me to a warning: Bone Tomahawk is nauseatingly graphic at times, seeming more like a close relative of Texas Chainsaw Massacre than most what we think of when we think of a Western film. It is raised above the usual fare by its clever heightened dialogue. Lines like ""You're mighty unfriendly for a guy named Buddy."" and humorous exchanges about soup make this a close cousin of superb films like True Grit. And excellent acting, led by Kurt Russell, who I think does not get nearly enough credit for just how fine and actor he really is. And Matthew Fox, of Lost fame, who is also a better actor than he usually gets credit for. It's a smart, though often brutal film, with a very original story and a very original take on the Western. It's also genuinely creepy. You can find it on Netflix if you want to check it out. But be warned. Bone Tomahawk is not for the faint of heart. It is definitely not for the faint of stomach. But is well worth the watch. If for no other reason than its uniqueness and originality. #movies #film #filmcritique #westerns #bonetomahawk",Bone Tomahawk
206,ramkoil,Well Made very Violent,3,23 April 2016,"I watched this movie an hour ago and still feel uneasy. The movie starts with a violent scene of a man's throat graphically being cut. You almost feel the force put on the knife. Very nu-necessary. Then the movie pace and posture changes and about hour and 20 minutes is rather slow, very slow. However the acting and dialogue, is good, and unlike Hollywood movies the characters are realistic and likable, (except for one, i get to that later). Then action starts and the movie changes its pace and character, dramatically. There are hands chopped. A man scalped and cut in half, all clearly and savagely shown in detail on the screen. I have seen my share of gore but this did bother me. If the director had refrained from such blatant graphic violence on the screen and just implied, this movie would be much better.As usual the female character in this movie is depicted as humorless, feeling less, rude, and two dimensional personality. God forbid if females show any signs of emotion in movies. The movie is about rescuing her. And when the rescue party meets her after they have been through hell for her, what do they get? Insults. No gratefulness, no thank you! I don't know why Hollywood shows females like this. Very unrealistic and unlikable.

207,peterkettle-904-444717,Horror Western...,10,26 March 2019,"Bone Tomahawk is a western written and directed by S. Craig Zahler, and it is a film that made me think of Cormac McCarthy. Instead of savage tribes of Indians, Mexicans and white vigilantes we had a wordless group of primitive troglodytes. Unthinkingly cruel to themselves as much as others, they blind women and impregnate them, drive bone whistles into their own throats to make signal calls; they are casual cannibals. It is a peculiar and powerful film, with an original blend of horror. There are admirable performances from Kurt Russell, Richard Jenkins (always brilliant), Patrick Wilson and Matthew Fox. A Western for sure, but with a highly original take on an old genre. If the Western is constantly declared dead it is as constantly resurrected. Along comes Missouri Breaks, The Unforgiven, True Grit, No Country For Old Men, or The Homesman.

Even than, the authentic setting is slowly established, which soon enough starts to unveil the dramatic ride of rather unusual and unsettling characters. Than – ""the second"" part of the movie builds up the tension in the story-line that breaks even the oddest expectations! And there it is - rather crazy anthropological element in the midst of usual Western motives, that serves as a realistic horror drive in the latter part of the movie. Even the (so to say) ""sarcastic music"" plays a part in surreal movie odor that culminates great. So it has peculiar atmosphere.

214,mmaggiano,Bad whatever the director's intention.,2,31 October 2015,"The movie is admirable for being an indie production, especially a Western/horror with an unusual sub-genre (a lost tribe of 'people').That said, I don't know what the director was trying to do, and I think it's bad regardless. Was he trying to make pulpy, tongue-in-cheek fare? It fails at the sort of humorous winks that would make that work. Was he trying to play it gritty and straight-ahead? It's ham-fisted. Was he trying for a weird mix of these two things? ...probably, but that isn't what jars me.What jars me is that every element in the movie is a mix of sometimes good, sometimes competently shrug-able, and sometimes incompetent. I will say that the lighting is generally good (with some conspicuously forced lighting here and there), and that the flat characterization is acceptable in a film of this genre.BUT, the story logic, the dialogue, the acting, the shot/edit/sequence decisions, the sound design-- they're often sub-par or terrible. If these were all good to great, the weird tone of the picture wouldn't bother me. As it is, the tone is just another semi-competent choice at best.I believe that the fan support for the film exists because the fans of the genre are starved for content. For this, and for executing an indie Western at all for $1.8M, I will give the director credit. But on its own merits, this is not a good or even fully competent movie.",Bone Tomahawk
215,dogwater-1,Not Your Daddy's Rio Lobo,9,22 November 2015,"Here's one. Bone Tomahawk is an adventure story, a horror story, a character-driven western, a dark comedy, a rescue story and an edge of the seat thriller all in one. Need more? Its a love story too. A very well-written script by S. Craig Zahler, who directed and a cast of superb actors headed by Kurt Russell who is the next most unsung Hollywood actor after acknowledgment of Jeff Bridges. Richard Jenkins, one of my favorite actors, gives the ""stand-by deputy"" role of Chicory such depth and truth that it stands as one of the best performances I've seen this year. Matthew Fox as an off-beat foppish gunfighter with a soul is charismatic. Patrick Wilson, who continues his career of interesting choices is rather heart-breaking as a man so in love with his wife, Lili Simmons, that he suffers mightily in his determination to rescue her. Ms. Simmons plays an unusual combination of a liberated woman and caustic commentator on the ""stupidity"" of the frontiersmen she lives around in the ironically titled town of 'Bright Hope'. David Arquette and Sid Haig channeling Slim Pickens set the stage at the beginning and from the first scene you know this is not 'My Darling Clementine'. Sure there is some gore of a type I've never quite seen before. Its minimal, but strong enough to unsettle anyone's nerves. As for the savages, well they're definitely savage and scary to boot.

It should therefore come as no surprise, the principal creative force, S. Craig Zahler is credited as; Scriptwriter, Director, and (unusually), also the Movie-Score composer. The script is taut and purposeful, with an almost 'Tarantinoesque' attention to the small but important details. The slow pace feels deliberate, and lulls you into a false sense of ease, which is exactly where Zahler wants you. In this state, you don't feel the horror creeping up on you until it's too late. From this false sense of peace, your comfort zone is shattered by an explosive change of circumstances. There's extremely effective use of tension and psychological dread, where you know bad things are going to happen, but not when. You know the enemy is brutal but also realise your hope they aren't also worse than just brutal; is definately futile.

For the genre, each has surprisingly good casting, and by extension, really sound acting. I liked the characters in each of them.Bone Tomahawk (BT) got around the issue of believable creatures by just not going there: they used a creepy humanoid species instead. That's the main ""horror week spot"" of TB, they opted for creatures which look in large part as actors wearing prosthetics, and I imagine some CGI.In fact, the parts I liked best in BT were more the characters on the trail, their predicaments, and their interactions, more than the horror aspect.I wasn't sure who would still be left standing by the end, and my feeling was that Kurt Russell might have it in his contract that he would be one of them :-).

Considering the excellent period costuming for the men, and even for Sean Young's character, why the hell was Samantha's (Lili Simmons) hair and makeup straight out of 2015? This sort of thing is always so infuriating, hair and make-up is often not period so that stupid people will more easily identify with characters and this isn't a film that needs to make that appeal at all.2. I'm sick and tired of the portrayal of almost every single gun shot completely instantly killing someone. Anyone who's seen someone get shot knows that it almost never instantly kills someone (unless you're a black person confronted by a white policeman in the US). Even a gunshot to the head will precipitate seizures, twitching and involuntary movement. In a film like this which is meant to be disturbing and gory, this inaccuracy is very frustrating.3. The stone age cannibals' portrayal was quite good, however their 'loincloths' were obviously way too conveniently attached in a very unlikely way.

In summary, I enjoyed the film from start to finish and was recommended other works from the director. Rest assure I will be looking into more of his films.",Bone Tomahawk

223,specialuse117,The western bone is connected to the horror bone,10,11 November 2015,"I absolutely loved this film. It is long (over 2 hours) but the pace is not slow. The pace is just right for the story. Even with this long run there is really not any back story on the heroes or the villains but it did not matter. The writing and acting were so stellar and even unconventional that I felt drawn into this western town. I could actually watch these characters just sit at the saloon and talk, especially Chicory. The humor worked, and when it got scary it really got scary. I did not want anything to happen to these people. I really felt for them. This was not an art film or a message film. There is no mention of global warming, evil businesses, corrupt governments, etc. Even the villains were not portrayed as innocent victims abused by others. The stereotypical heroic female did not save the day, the token minority who sacrifices themselves was absent. There was not even the brave reporter or newsperson who risks all for the story. Just an entertaining movie.",Bone Tomahawk

A simple premise and plot line allows the brilliant acting, script, and atmosphere-building to really shine. This is a true slow-burn horror film that carefully builds a sense of dread, and leads to a spectacularly awful climactic ending.This film is not for newbies, and certainly not for those with weak stomachs. I consider myself a pretty seasoned horror film watcher, and this movie will stick with me for a long time. It requires a bit of patience, but the payoff is worth it, and the journey there is beautiful.",Bone Tomahawk

Instead i got a dark, pretty realistic western with a simple story. Bone Tomahawk is one of those movies that shines with it's characters. After the wife of a crippled man, played by Patrick Wilson, is kidnapped by wild cannibals, a couple of men are going on a rescue mission to save her. The four men can't be more different and that's what drives the movie. The movie is slow and if you're looking for fast paced entertainment or great moments, you are probably having a hard time with it. If you like stories about a group of people in an extrem situation, you're right. Don't expect too much, but for a nice evening with no expectations, this movie serves very well.",Bone Tomahawk
226,sergicaballeroalsina,A contrasted western,8,1 September 2017,"The triviality of the dialogues makes the most casual western I could remember so far. The distension with which the people from Bright Hope live the most plausible western I know. In this movie the clichés are replaced by the witty humor, by the quiet and unimportant talks that generate custom, that do the daily life. Then, in response to a manifestation of unsuspected violence, the reaction of the community is very reasonable. An armed troop is formed suddenly. A troop of imperfect heroes; very human. The trip is heavy and there is someone who does not shut up. So far so good but this warm western becomes ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and the sense of horror is enormous precisely because of the normality with which the facts had developed. Tension; a lot of tension. Just as westerns lovers could expect from a western. But it is not justice or revenge. Bone Tomahawk reach the tension in an unprecedented way; through terror. The scenes are very horrible but also very brief. Just a brushstroke. A sufficient measure. What a way to suffer! A movie where there is no place for complacency. Demolisher. Unique.",Bone Tomahawk
227,unyan,Peculiar in so many ways,7,22 February 2020,You don't see many films like this one where the attention to characters personalities and their often inane dialogue Manages to keep you interested in the very slow plot. I would describe it as a kind of mix between the descent and Dawn til Dusk the cannibals themselves put me in mind of the troglodytes in the 1960 version of the Time Machine. It's over long at two hours but the reason for this is to get to know all of the protagonists Gory in parts and somewhat baffling in others.,Bone Tomahawk
228,cmills-98693,The lovechild of True Grit and The Hills Have Eyes,9,17 June 2019,"Bone Tomahawk is phenomenal.You have to split it down into its sub-genres and it nails every single one. As a western it's similar to that of True Grit and is certainly worthy of that accolade, it's pithy, gruelling and harsh. Watching the rancher drag his broken leg around for 5 days is painful to watch, and thats before you hit any of the moments of horror.The horror element is exceptional, if, in my opinion, a little short. The deaths are as gruesome as they are realistic and you can't tear your eyes away, although during one you wish you could.Bone Tomahawk is fantastic, it's cast are exceptional and Kurt Russell puts in one of his best performances.

Granted for the scenery a lot money weren't needed but it looked way better then it was ""payed for"". It starts off with an action sequence and continues with relatively no action til the last 10 percent of the movie. But don't let that fool you, the dialogue builds very interesting characters and the comedy pops up here and there. The actors are amazing which makes the movie even more enjoyable even though the well made action is kept to the minimum. I wouldn't recommend this to watch with your friends on a late night to see some gory action but if you're not looking for that and actually want to enjoy the Western atmosphere, cowboys and some really well made action and gore. This movie is perfect.",Bone Tomahawk
231,Alenbalz,Bare bones,3,30 December 2015,"Can,t see what all the fuss is about this movie. Yeah a western that really isn't a western, And is applauded by other reviewers because it has a bit of horror in it. Cave dwelling cannibal Indians, is a pretty stupid idea, as far as I'm concerned. Better if this theme was set in Middle Ages Europe rather than the Wild West. So these cannibal Indians sneak into a town, kill an unsuspecting negro stable hand And abduct a prisoner, deputy and female doctor treating the prisoner, And a bit like true grit, the sheriff, other deputy, husband and an Indian hater go out after them, not knowing how many they will find,, What makes it really absurd, is the husband has a broken leg, that gets worse every day, because he doesn't rest it as he should. So 2/3 of the movie is about the journey and the last 1/3 is the confrontation, with the usual predictable ending. There are some graphic scenes of a man being scalped and cut in two by the cannibals, but the abducted wife's role and character is pathetically written and acted, especially as she's already witnessed this happening to the prisoner. And true to Hollywood style a gratuitous sex scene early on in the movie. Overall a ridiculous setting for an interesting idea.",Bone Tomahawk

233,theredhairedcrow,Unforgettable For a Variety of Reasons,8,23 October 2015,"Russell, Fox and Jenkins give realistic, believable portrayals in their roles. Facing danger and death with the stoicism and dry wit historically attributed to many European settlers, as well as the historic though understated bigotry towards any non-whites one character voiced. Russell was on-point, his expressions and reactions excellent as Sheriff Hunt, and his ""back-up"" deputy Chicory played by Richard Jenkins and he had personal dynamics that really made the film.Deaths were very, very graphic both visually and audibly in a stark brutally simplistic way. There is nothing of comedic horror in this film, of absurdity or ""bloodshed for fun"". The setting, the ""reality"" of their situation were harsh and horrific in the exact sense of that word, and though tagged as ""horror"" in genre, it's not one I would personally apply. While I didn't care for the typical ""settler heroes"" vs. ""savages"" theme, the comment by a Native American in the film, ""Those are not MY people!"" provided some relevant clarity and truth that all indigenous are not homogeneous, in past or present.The only irritating part I found was Lili Simmons' ""Mrs. O'Dwyer"": a naturally young, very beautiful and highly skilled doctor who has lived in the west with her husband but still has to ask, ""Are those gunshots?"" Along with the end song, after setting such a gritty, touching western of determined courage in the face the unknown, those two aspects lessened the film from a higher rating for me. For those not used to or cannot handle such graphic visuals, the story itself is compelling enough to close your eyes at those points, because you don't want to miss this unforgettable tale.",Bone Tomahawk

Instead they not only just kill him, but kidnap a woman and a sheriff deputy. (Why? They really kidnap people and drag them trough a 4 days desert trip?) Whatever. Then the husband with the bad leg joines a search team. Which is hunted down one by one. Except the husband who has an injury. And at the end love certanly triumphs, they kill the bad Indians one by one.
No suprises, no real antagonist characters. The Indians are two dimensional, they are just dumb, cruel savage cannibals.So, the movie does not provide any suprises and most of the time I felt the blood and gore placed only as shocking value so they could tell: wow we have made an excellent western movie which is also a horror!

236,peterm1,Surprisingly good,7,19 April 2017,"When I stumbled on this movie on late night TV I was not sure what to expect. But it had a respectable cast and so I persisted. The folks acting in this clearly knew how to act.The thing that really drew me in though was the dialogue spoken, the language used characters drawn. It is here that I noticed some similarities to other recent classic westerns that really got into the character of the Old West. ""Open Range"", ""Lonesome Dove"" and ""True Grit"" (the Coen Brothers version) all come to mind. That version of True Grit is one of my favorite movies of all time largely due to its verisimilitude and the Coen Brothers attention to detail and respect for the original story. Comparing this to that movie is therefore meant as a badge of merit.These are all movies where there is little to accommodate post modern sensibilities. And the language used, the morality displayed and customs depicted are all much as I understand them to have been in that 1870s era. All movies are about the willing suspension of disbelief. This is even more true with horror movies and the like. And nothing spoils the mood so much as the tendency found in too many modern movies to have the characters all look and sound as if they are walking the streets of Los Angeles in 2010 (but in cowboy clothes). This film has its characters use language, dress, behave and express views that adhere to the mores of an earlier time - duty, perseverance in the face of adversity, sacrifice and other late Victorian ideas of what it is to be a good and honorable man.Undoubtedly the movie has some flaws. I will let you find them yourself as I don't think they are of such magnitude as to damage the story too much. But parts of the movie are surprisingly scary too. And while that is what the movie is ostensibly about, I have to say it is its ability to evoke old-time values that really won me over. I am not usually too much into horror movies (too often they are only horrible in a bad way - script, story, acting, paper-mache monsters etc) But this is not one of those, it is instead made in a really craftsman-like way that held my interest and engagement to the ending scenes.",Bone Tomahawk

Small build ups to nothing. Very little ""happens"" through out and it's tedious. The acting is good but they are tasked with lifeless dialogue. The last 40 minutes of this endless movie get a bit better but by that time I didn't care and was ready for it to be over. YMMV but as much as I love Kurt Russel this movie doesn't deserve the high ratings it is receiving. Like The Hateful Eight...needlessly slow and forgetful.",Bone Tomahawk

The movie starts with an awful scene about someone cutting someone else's throat with all the details shown. I mean, we get the idea, why go into the ugly details? Also, when the cannibals decided to eat the deputy, was it really necessary to show how they cut him? The scene is really really disturbing. I even looked away in the middle of it. Why show all this violence and disturbing scenes? Is it the trend now? I wish I have never seen this movie, it will be stuck in my head for a long time.

The stupid premise that some cliff dwelling supernatural beings were so upset with a robber that desecrated their burial ground that they traveled 3 to 4 days .. probably 75 miles .. to kill the guy and abduct the female doctor that treated him for a gunshot wound is laughable.I was hoping like many other bad horror movies that every character would be killed.

It feels like that they didn't have anything to make the movie longer as the plot itself is like 3-4 pages long stretched for more than 2 hours. Not much happens throughout and neither are the cave dwellers who at least should be intimidating are any good as at the end they switch their button to go from stupid to completely stupid.

Although both films are entertaining, the ""Bone Tomahawk"" is a little more thrilling.Some people might say is a slow movie. But why a slow movie should mean that the film is necessarily bad? Anyway was not for me, and slow can be also good. It would be too boring to see those cowboys killing and slaughtering Indians for the all 120 minutes...

Dialogue was excellent in the early part of the film as well. But it all got very awkward and boring once the posse headed off to get the troglodytes. Did they really have to focus so much time on men travelling through the desert, with nothing much happening ? The scenes in the cave were gruesome enough, but the troglodytes didn't really seem scary...just bit extras dressed up in grey make-up.

My decision was influenced by the cast, that included such excellent actors as Kurt Russell, and Richard Jenkins, surely one of the finest character actors working today, and in a change of pace for him, outstanding in this role. David Arquette lends able support, in what for him has become a somewhat signature character. The script is well focused, and literate, and no one blinks at the notion of cannibalistic foes as the malefactors here. It is slow at the outset, and picks up speed as it goes, altogether well paced. An adventure, and a character study. A good film, well acted by all. Very much recommended.",Bone Tomahawk

I thought that lesson number 1 is that less is more. You don't need the Hellos and Goodbyes that pad out every scene. I know, by showing a normal, mundane life you make the horror that follows more horrific yet but the earlier, excruciatingly long, wooden scenes of stilted dialogue back at the ranch add nothing other than embarrassment to the actors' faces. The posse camps at night and we expect a cannibal attack at any moment and the deputy requests advice from the sheriff on how to read a book in the bath without getting it wet! And the scene drags on... and on... just too funny. At half the length, this would have been a good horror short. Interesting idea, good cinematography but...",Bone Tomahawk

It felt like a mix between The Hatefull Eight and The Descent, which sounds quite exciting if we're being honest.I really enjoyed following Sheriff Franklin (Kurt Russel) and John Brooder (Mathew Fox). Not only did they played the coolest characters, they also had the best performances. At least, that's my opinion. It's nice to see Kurt Russel back and I still believe that Matthew Fox is underrated. That being said I couldn't care less about the other main characters.

255,RageQuitLeigh,A breath of fresh air,9,19 January 2021,"A breath of fresh air amongst modern movies, which shows that great movies begin and end with great scripts and well chosen casting.The premise revolves around the kidnapping of 2 residents of a sleepy western town and a recently arrived drifter by a cave dwelling tribe. The towns sheriff and 3 other men embark on a long horseback journey to rescue the missing town folk.Westerns do tend to be very decisive amongst movie fans. The wider public accuse them of being boring and for good reason. They tend to follow the same themes and cliches leading toward very similar set pieces and endings. So despite that i implore you to give Bone Tomahawk a go, it feels different.There is a charm about this movie where whilst being set 1890s could have been at any time in a sleepy town in the middle of nowhere. It doesn't get caught up in too much of the time period, use annoying language or have long unrelatable conversations.Likewise this movie could have been made at any point in the past 70 years. It doesn't resort to modern special effects. What we have is a well crafted, shot and acted cinematic movie.What really seals the deal here though is the cast. It is as well chosen as i've seen in a while. Kurt Russell is fantastic as the well weathered but courageous sheriff but its Richard Jenkins that steals the show as the 'back up deputy' a bumbling older gent who provides well placed comic relief but is often the moral compass throughout the story.Highly recommended.",Bone Tomahawk
256,Gabriel_Kuntze,Western Horror With Kurt Russell? Yes Please!,8,23 March 2021,"While not a fan of westerns, I watched this movie specifically for Kurt Russell, and I was pleasanty surprised. The whole setting is very well done, although many times the movie is way too dark, and everything seems so ""clean"" for a western. The suspense is amazing and the troglodytes are a scary bunch. There's some gore which is really nasty and does serves a purpose, it's not there just to freak you out.If you like a different take on the western genre, I thoroughly recommend this. Character development is done really well, you end up knowing the group of cowboys and rooting for them, even for John Brooder, who's kinda messed up. And if you like good ol' Kurt, get ready for some kick ass scenes from the most underrated badass guy from the 80s and 90s. I loved some lines of dialog, too.Overall, another proof that low budget films (only 1.8m!) can be really good, and even better than high budget crap. 8/10",Bone Tomahawk

Kurt Russell won our hearts as Wyatt Earp and to see him in another leading Western movie role was great. His acting was spot on and believable as always. Patrick Wilson continues to shine as one of Hollywood's best male actors. His role as a cowboy with a fractured shin makes you feel his pain. His desire to find his wife is also believable and passionate. Mathew Fox was seriously amazing as a well to do, former soldier turned gun slinger. Truly captured his role better than anyone. Richard Jenkins puts a performance as Deputy Sheriff together that is not only funny, but lovable, innocent and honest. The banter between the above mentioned parties was spot on and their connection together as actors was simply stellar.What you'll find is a true Western movie that has some very graphic and well done scenes in the first two thirds of the movie. What happens at the final third is disturbing and brilliant horror. Like Dusk til Dawn the movie switches speed at the end with surprises you may not be prepared for. Unlike Dusk Til Dawn, you wont find the quips in humor to lighten up the mood, keeping a serious and brutal tone.I refuse to give away one death scene to anyone who has yet to see the movie.

261,MediaboyMusings,"Great cast, excellent dialogue, and impressive visuals on a budget",8,19 December 2015,"Between its ""horror western"" billing and barely detectable presence at the box office, Bone Tomahawk has ""cult film"" written all over it and that's a shame because it certainly deserves a wider audience. The 10 or so people I've asked about Bone Tomahawk had never heard of it and that lack of awareness, due to little or no promotion, is an unfortunate by-product of the film's independent nature (it cost less than $2 million to make). Kurt Russell, the film's star, turns in a first-rate performance as Frank Hunt, the sheriff of a frontier town in the American West in the 1800's. Russell hasn't acted much since starring in Quentin Tarantino's Death Proof in 2007 and it's nice to see him back in 2015 with some high profile and meaty roles (this summer's Furious 7 and Tarantino's about-to-be-released The Hateful Eight). Here, he's surrounded by a talented cast that includes Patrick Wilson (Watchmen and the current season of TV's Fargo), Richard Jenkins (The Visitor and TV's Six Feet Under), and Matthew Fox (TV's Lost), with additional support from David Arquette, Lili Simmons, and Sean Young.First-time director S. Craig Zahler also wrote the character-driven screenplay, which Russell called ""the best Western I've read since Tombstone"". I was rather surprised to learn that 1993's Tombstone was the last western Russell had appeared in, considering how memorable he was in it as Wyatt Earp and how comfortable he seems in the genre (apparently he's making up for lost time - The Hateful Eight is also a Western). The gruff Hunt, sporting a lite version of the full-on Yosemite Sam-style facial hair Russell displays in Tarantino's upcoming film, heads up a four-man posse who represent the only hope for some locals kidnapped by a tribe of cannibalistic cave-dwellers. Also included in the foursome are Jenkins' bumbling deputy (the film's go-to source for comic relief), Fox's dandyish gunslinger, and Wilson as the broken-legged distraught husband of one of the kidnapped townsfolk. The physical limitations of Wilson's character impede the urgent nature of the group's quest, who need to make a five day journey in three days. That conveniently helps to extend the time available for the interplay between the four radically different characters and it's those lively exchanges that are Bone Tomahawk's core strength. Viewers looking for extended action sequences or buckets of blood will be sorely disappointed - this is a slowly paced and talk-heavy film. That being said, Bone Tomahawk does contain some occasionally brutal visuals; one particularly disturbing scene is likely to stay with you long after the credits have finished rolling.One of the few faults I can find with Bone Tomahawk is that it does feel a tad overstretched at 132 minutes. Otherwise, Zahler impresses mightily in a directorial debut that features excellent casting, sharp dialogue, and a beautiful look that shows no signs of the film's minuscule budget.mediaboymusings.blogspot.ca",Bone Tomahawk
262,revboose-781-838014,Beowulf on Horses,7,25 June 2017,"Despite the rather sedate pace and relative lack of action, as others have said, the acting makes this movie really flow. The characters are not simply types - the director works hard to give them a hair of background and more than just a surface personality. While the female lead is very much the traditional ""damsel in distress"", she has a strength to her that is trusted by the townsfolk she serves.Issue #1 - the dialogue between some characters seems very clipped and overly formal, the kind of language that works well in a novel but sounds forced on-screen. I have the same issue with True Grit (the more recent one). However, assuming this is intended as a close reflection of how people spoke in those days (rather than letting them simply speak like us, now), it is what it is.Issue #2 - calling the story ""original"". Folks, it's Beowulf on horses. Yes, there are some interesting elements that I haven't seen used with this story before, but on the whole, if you've seen Beowulf or The 13th Warrior, you'll twig to a lot of plot elements fairly early.This being said, the movie was worth a watch, even if only once. Kurt Russell is excellent, but Richard Jenkins absolutely steals the whole show. If you've only ever seen him as smarmy business-types, you need to watch him really stretch here (or lose his mind in Cabin In The Woods - just sayin'!)",Bone Tomahawk

I liked the actors and I liked the settings etc But there was plenty things that didn't make any sought of sense to me. We are expected to believe that there is a small tribe of troglodytes living in the American outback who capture cowboys etc to consume as food? This tribe kill people after fighting yet leave the bodies to either rot or get eaten by wild life but kill there captives after struggling to get them into the cave, This tribe live in a small cave in the side of a mountain which can only be accessed by a couple of ropes ? This tribe we are again to believe can do throat surgery and implant some sought of device into each others necks to make them sound more vocal ? We are also expected to believe that they have stayed hidden for hundreds of years yet the tribe only has a few members ?, Next we are expected to believe that the lead characters can be injured yet seem to show no pain even though one has a whiskey hipflask which has been made white hot inserted into his body BUT he only makes a whimper?

269,sure_man,Not your classic western,4,14 November 2019,"There's a piece in Granta written during the Bosnia war in the '90s that spent many pages describing the beauty of both the natural environment and the multiple cultures coexisting there. It then introduced a random guy who was hunting in the mountains to feed his family. An army patrol came upon him totally by accident and, after some dialogue, determined he was of the opposing ethnic group. They subsequently abused him and, slicing the skin at both the bottom of his spine and at his neck, inserted a pole along his spinal column under the skin, hung him between two trees and proceeded to roast him, apparently for the fun of it. This event was shocking within the idyllic literary context of what had preceded it and had the effect on the reader of having been mentally raped.Bone Tomahawk has a little of this quality. Along with some prurient fluff and desert travelogue, the film reflects the hard, unromanticised existential barrenness associated with Cormac McCarthy's work about the old West, tinged with a little bit of Larry McMurtry's Blue Duck. The characterizations reflect the settler's resignation of everyone understanding their roles, as well as the inevitably of them walking into a fate ultimately beyond their control, all the while making conscious choices to fulfill them. The representation of the savage's cosmology with the rock circles was left unexplained, but was a crudely constructed representation for a culture totally beyond the comprehension of the settler's (i.e. weird sounds, bones in cheeks). All that is presumed by the viewer is the lethal consequences when these two cultures came into contact with one another. The film doesn't really prompt us to ask any questions, only to accept the cowboys-and-Indians dynamic, while at the same time suggesting maybe we should be asking questions. (And recall the scene in the bar with the palpably demeaning ""racial"" hostility of the ""professor"" when being quizzed on the nature of the possible assailants.) And obviously, similar to the in the Granta piece, the jarring visualized butchering was a bit much and sort of unnecessary, a violent reality whose cruelty we don't want to admit we understand or have the capacity for, although it did move the story to its climax.Life in the West was brutish and often short. What seems like a slow pace is the result of our expectations based on standard commercial films bathing us in action and visual fireworks. I suppose that begs the question of whether I would either recommend this movie or watch it again. On both accounts, I'd have to say no.",Bone Tomahawk
270,WinterbornTM,Nice Surprise,8,14 November 2015,"Bone Tomahawk is a 2015 western-horror written and directed by S. Craig Zahler and starring Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox and Richard Jenkins.The story follows four men, the town's sheriff (Russell), a cowboy (Wilson), the back-up deputy (Jenkins) and a gunslinger (Fox) who go on an expedition to retrieve a group of captives from some cannibalistic cave-dwellers. The four actors really shine in this movie, giving very good performances, especially Matthew Fox as John Brooder. It's good to see Fox in such a good role, considering he hasn't done that much since the Lost years.The movie gives us a very good look at the Old West. As the four men make their journey, we learn more and more about them and their motivations. Sheriff Franklin Hunt is a man who wants nothing more than the safety of his town and is willing to do anything to protect it. Arthur O'Dwyer is a cowboy who has a serious leg injury but still goes into this expedition, because for him the stakes are personal. Chicory is a simple-minded old deputy but with amazing loyalty for the sheriff. John Brooder is a well-dressed well- mannered gentleman who joins the ride because he is a trigger-happy gunslinger with a personal vendetta against the natives.The script is very well-written, giving us full tri-dimensional characters. Also the dialogue and the mannerisms feel very authentic, transporting you back to the Old West. As I said in the beginning, this movie is a horror-western, and that really shows in the third act. There are some brutal, gore-scenes that will not be easy to digest (no pun intended) for those faint of heart. One slight negative about this movie is the pacing. Sometimes it feels a little too slow, but not enough so that it will ruin your enjoyment.Bone Tomahawk is a very good movie, with an interesting premise and a nice twist on the western genre. It's a movie that could have gone wrong in so many ways, but surprisingly, it doesn't. Sporting some great characters and an intriguing storyline, Bone Tomahawk deserves an 8 out of 10!",Bone Tomahawk
271,markwoo,"Horrible, given 2 stars only for some of the dialogue",2,31 October 2015,"This is a very unpleasant film and I would not recommend it to anyone. From the sordid opening of watching two murderous bushwhackers at work the film hardly improves and some of it frankly ridiculous. The supposedly smart sheriff allows a badly injured husband to accompany a rescue mission that is destined to last at least 4 days on horseback –never going to happen. Then there is the question of how the troglodytes got to the town and back with three captives as they seem to lack horses – daft. Of course you then have to have some unidentified Mexican baddies to steal the rescuers horses forcing the crippled husband to hobble for miles – unbelievable – and surprise, surprise he lags behind but still heroically presses on despite aggravating his injury more than once – even more unbelievable. The three leading rescuers get to the troglodyte hideout and promptly get attacked and one is killed and the other two caught and hauled up to their cave. Oh, I forgot to mention that the troglodytes cannot talk only make a completely weird call which of course they do repeatedly to alert all and sundry to their presence. The two remaining rescuers find that the gimp's wife and other deputy are still alive (after what 5/6 days) and of course their presence brings about the near instant and horrible butchery of the other deputy. But at last the cavalry arrives as gimpy the husband finally gets to the cave area. He manages to kill two troglodytes and immediately realises that they have something in their throats so he cuts this device out of one of the troglodytes and uses it to make those weird calls so more troglodytes come running towards him so he can shoot them. The last and final idiocy has gimpy arriving in the cave crawling having climbed up to the cave (which, by the way looked pretty inaccessible) unseen and unheard and effects a rescue.

274,VardAntinyan,A nutrient in the art department,10,19 March 2019,"Once I heard Clint Eastwood saying making a good movie is really about finding a good story. A captivating genuine story often can empower performances and directing within its realm and deliver a single piece of art to its audience.Bone Tomahawk is more than that. It's so powerful in its realism, so meticulous in every second of performances, so discreet in its promise, and so thorough in its delivery that it feels fulfilled in the gut after watching. It's a nutrient in the art department.I noticed some reviewers tried to classify it as western, horror, or drama. Some noticed some racial nuances. Let me state this, though, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter because the story teller and the director didn't think about it, and it's a good thing too. A genuine story shouldn't regard restrictions of any kind. Classifications can be left to the critics.Performances are striking. I carefully watched every single move and every single sentence of K. Russell as a sheriff, and he makes solid sense in every second. He is not only so convincing, but also so attractive character that rivets the viewer. Emotions passing his face deep and transparent at the same time.Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox, and Richard Jenkins inhabit three fundamentally different characters that come together in a single journey. Merely curious interactions of their worldviews keep the audience very busy before they'll get to their destiny.The dialog are powerful, somewhat formal but never ungenuine. One feels precisely that the formality comes from the main characters themselves. Paying attention to other characters reveals that formality of the dialog is not a signature of the movie: it just happened that the main characters were so.The furnishing of the houses and the little admirable sketches of the family lives of the characters create a unique vantage, making the viewer feeling in the same room with the characters. And all of these, punctuate with horrid scenes, that comes natural to the characters' environment, creates a solid masterpiece of modern cinema.I predict this movie not to be hype, or cult, or otherwise recognized widely, the reason being no clear bad characters, but rather accidentally bad situations. These might make some simplistic viewers unreachable to the movie. But it will be recognized by the few sophisticated viewers as an accomplished art with its solid place in the world cinema.",Bone Tomahawk

But what I really expected was that the story would be diluted with a couple of dashing cowboy jokes or some interesting events that dilute the movement of the heroes to the cherished goal. But I didn't see it. There were some attempts, such as gangsters Mexicans and stealing horses, but all this was presented so crumpled and inaudible, that did not leave a smooth account of any memories. The duration of the film is very long, and at some point I caught myself thinking that I was incredibly bored. The dynamics are simply zero. Well, let's say the creators of the film didn't set a goal to show us dashing shootings and fights - that's not the message, but in this case, I can't understand what justified such an impressive duration of the film.There are no special claims to the actors. What they were offered, they played. But the very images of the main characters were not impressed, they are cardboard and some fresh, inanimate.

People expect Westerns now to be grey in morals, ethics and looks. But Bone Tomahawk - although grey - is unlike any modern Western by any standard. It feels more like a horror - and I'm not just talking about the buckets of blood and gore. I'm talking about the FEEL - the anxiety, tension and supremely uneasy (realistic even) feel of the film.

281,gharbinour,Powerful and gritty horror/western movie,10,12 December 2019,"Bone Tomahawk is powerful. The last half hour must be one of the most violent I have ever seen on screen. It's shockingly brutal. The film belongs to the Weird West genre, a mix of western and horror. The last Weird West flicks I saw were the disappointing The Hateful Eight and the pretty cool Ravenous. My favorite in the genre is Se sei vivo spara by Giulio Questi. S. Craig Zahler is a newcomer, but he wrote several screenplays before directing his first picture. He has written The Incident by Alexandre Courtès. Bone Tomahawk is kind of slow, but never boring. I loved the scenery, the dialogues and the nice characters of the film. It has such a remarkable cast, Kurt Russel is far better in this than in The Hateful Eight, he plays the rightful strong silent cowboy. And I adored Richard Jenkins' character, I didn't recognized him right away. Bone Tomahawk has a creepy, but cool soundtrack that the director scored himself being also a musician. But for me, the biggest quality of the film is the cannibals. I enjoyed that we don't see them for almost the entire film, it creates expectations and suspense. They talk about them, they are a menace, but we don't see them for the most part, a little like Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now or the Cajuns in Southern Comfort. When you finally see them, they look so damn scary. They are cruel and soulless creatures. The design of their body is also very interesting.

They are just extremely boring. The creators also thought, well, besides good characters and dialogues, a Tarantino movie needs some brutality. However, Tarantino knows how to make a good movie where brutality fits in. The writer and director team of Bone Tomahawk did not.

And even more so for a throwaway scene at the end. I felt both crossed far over the normal ""shock"" line, and were there merely to titillate and generate controversy. In fact the last 20 minutes of Bone Tomahawk undoes everything the rest of the movie built towards, by descending into the unrealistic-bordering-on-supernatural. This just broke the suspension of disbelief for me. It felt like the grown-up staff left the film set and let a bunch of teenage boys carry on making the final few minutes of the movie.It's a real shame, because the rest of the movie is absolutely astonishing. The pace, camerawork, dialogue (for the most part) builds the impending dread beautifully. This is a finely crafted horror film hiding in a very convincing western skin. Despite the long running time, It's difficult to tear your eyes away... until the moment when the filmmakers clearly decided they were going to force you to do that. And as the credits roll, those scenes are pretty much all you'll remember (every time you shut your eyes).SPOILERS
Specifically, I feel Nick would have passed out from the pain long before the movie finally lets him. And can two people really tear a human carcass in half as easily as that? I doubt it.

However, the movie is a mixture of great and not-so-great.The great thing about this movie is how compelling the story is. There are lots of tense and intriguing scenes that really got my attention and surprised me at times. Another great thing is the setting, it's been long since we've seen a good movie set in this time with a cowboys and Indians plot. No, The Revenant is a great ""western"", but this is more the type of westerns I'm looking for. The ensemble cast is good as well. Kurt Russell mainly plays Kurt Russell, he's a lot like his character in The Hateful Eight, nothing too special but very amusing and lots of charisma in his role. Patrick Wilson was a mixture of great and bad, the anger his character showed was very well done, but in a neutral state he just felt bland. The same goes for the rest of the cast: when they have to show emotions they're great, but when they don't they just seem very average. Except for Kurt's character. Speaking of which, the characters are not very memorable or relatable at all, but that's not not what the movie is about. So if you're expecting that, don't watch this. Simple as that.Now what are some actual flaws? The dialogue felt so unreal and unnatural at times, all characters except from Kurt Russell all have some cringe worthy dialogue or just very bland. Another flaw I have with this movie is the cinematography. For some reason, the cinematographer chose to put the focus on things that weren't the focus at all, such as the scene where Patrick Wilson's character is reading his 'poem'. The cinematography is my biggest complaint.Anyways, most people will probably overlook those flaws and they didn't bother me THAT much. Bone Tomahawk is a fresh idea converted into a good film.

Each character brings their own dynamic to this film and they each nail their roles quite well. I'm not sure why people would negatively rate this film for not being appropriate for children. Most western films have a dark grittiness to them that would not be appropriate for children so I'm not sure what parents were expecting from this one. Nothing about this movie suggests that it would be appropriate for children. It's dark, a bit slow at times but it does its job in bringing the viewer into this intense western thriller.

293,twiss54,More than worthwhile,8,25 September 2017,"As a 60+year-old fan of the Western genre, I give this film accolades for its gritty realism. It is very violent, and, has been mentioned in other user reviews, should not be shown to the younger folks. In recent years, there have been a number of straight-to-video or straight-to-streaming Westerns that have scored highly in dirt-in-the-craw realism but have been sorely lacking in character development. This movie scores in both departments, I feel. Richard Jenkins, in particular, unrecognizable in his role (I had to look up the character here on IMDb to see who the actor was... and was surprised to find it was he), gives us a character worth remembering. Lili Simmons brings to mind Diane Lane in 'Lonesome Dove.' Of course, Kurt Russell delivers as the no-nonsense sheriff who gets more than he bargained for. Worth watching but not for the squeamish.",Bone Tomahawk
294,hamanoooo23,Boring Tomahawk,2,16 November 2019,"Forget the borefest and plot holes... am I the only person who was irritated by the incompetent directing? The shots/edits/sequences/sound effects were terrible and felt unnatural (far below average). The movie did not flow smoothly, and the horrendous dialogue by our one-dimensional characters did not help either.Despite all that, I still kept watching and had hope in the troglodytes and gore. But after 2 hours of nothing, I was further disappointed by the lame cave-dwellers as they did not strike me as terrifying nor brutal - they were stupid and slow.I do not understand how this movie got such high ratings (most likely because of the cast), and why many are complaining about it being gruesome and excessively violent. With the exception of one scene which only men would sympathize with, every other death was normal. We didn't even get to see them properly eat anyone.",Bone Tomahawk
295,ajepisode13,Amateur approach to a promising idea,5,28 January 2018,"The Old West...cannibals....cowboys....damsel in distress....posse of various characters. The plot here is an interesting one, with genuine possibilities of something special, something different. But oh dear, the directing is right out of the Ed Wood School of Film-making. The talented Kurt Russell is totally wasted, and the beautiful Lili Simmons is completely under-used. Richard Jenkins manages to deliver the better dialogue but the rest of the cast are, sadly, in the hands of someone who looks as if he's never seen a film in his life. I can't imagine there was a storyboard or considerable production-planning. 
There is so much scope for real suspense throughout the search for the missing townsfolk, but the director uses nothing to suggest tension or fear.
He needs to watch films from the 40s and 50s, and learn how to involve the audience more. 
The landscapes are attractive but the cameraman uses little creative or artistic skills in the remainder of the film. So sad, because the premise is a really good one. I just wish someone with real skills had taken the helm: we would have a much better film, I believe.",Bone Tomahawk
296,jmbovan,Disappointing revulsion.,3,18 January 2019,"First, the minimalist acting style that is becoming more common in certain types of independent film doesn't sit well with me. And in a Western that tends for gritty simple one tone expression, having this apparent minimalist expression just falls flat. Story line was flat with blunted characters just appear and then go as the story shifted. There was no character development simply caricatures of stereotypes of western roles. Adding the cannibalism to this film seemed to be a way for us to care about the flat caricatures that didn't pull for any empathy outside of ""Oh no that would be inhuman!"" Just a flat mess of an idea that seems to be ""unique"" because this is the first western film to merge with cannibalism (or if not the first the most graphic in its depiction?). As a fan of horror films, this was just unsettling without any horror, just the revulsion of inhumanity. As a lesser fan of westerns but decidedly a fan of epic and thoughtful ones, this was disappointing given what they could have tried to convey but seemed incapable of making a larger societal allegory that was hinted in small moments. Basically, the film conveyed ""Old West was hard, and you have to be strong to survive because humans can be inhuman monsters"". Disappointing. Revolting.",Bone Tomahawk
297,BloodGuts,"If THE DESCENT was directed by CLINT EASTWOOD, this would be the end result.",9,18 February 2016,"Like buses, westerns tend to be extinct until three pop up at once. Quentin Tarantino's big budget THE HATEFUL EIGHT along with the James Ransone economical vehicle THE TIMBER and now the more sinister events of BONE TOMAHAWK.Sharing the lead, Kurt Russell, with two of the three mentioned, BONE TOMAHAWK is a western that hides its horror extremely well, paying off with a viciously brutal closing chapter. Sent into the wilderness after his wife is kidnapped, Patrick Wilson (THE CONJURING, INSIDIOUS) takes the local sheriff (Russell) on a lengthy trek to retrieve not only his wife but to put peace to the natives who feed on the flesh of humanity.While Russell looks like he has just walked off the set of THE HATEFUL EIGHT and owns the screen, the rest of the cast play a supportive pillar in this unconventional film of two parts. The film's drama is played straight from the pages of a Clint Eastwood western. Slow pace, macho behaviour and a penchant for a good gun fight all here in check. In principle none of the central characters are initially likable but their motives relatable. Whether it is the ruthless deputy Brooder (Michael Fox) or the lovable charm of Chicory (Richard Jenkins), the supportive network the unlikely companions share builds stronger as the stakes raise higher. It is only when the tribe confront the captors that the true horror arrives and only the minds of Eli Roth and Neil Marshall could imagine something so blood worthy.Despite its nature, BONE TOMAHAWK is a more faithful western than this year's bigger film and while the score doesn't quite live up to the classic of Ennio Morricone's instantly classic score, there is an authenticity in S. Craig Zahler's film that extends further than its rivals. Whether it is the barren wastelands or the hateful characters, the costumes or sheer humanity that drives the cast through, this film lays waste to over scripted wordplay in favour of a slow build up to a very tense final chapter.If THE DESCENT was directed by CLINT EASTWOOD, this would be the end result. One scene in particular will be treasured as the most cringe worthy moment of 2016, and surprisingly, even with the surreal unfolding of events, the film never over plays the horror so much as to forget this is a western at heart, just don't forget to take a sick bag.> Martyn Wakefield is writer and editor for BloodGuts UK Horror and has contributed over 250 reviews dedicated to the horror genre.",Bone Tomahawk

302,toyandmerchandise,Good not great,7,15 August 2020,Got recommended this by a film critic that we have on BBC radio Wales who said that it was great.The film isn't great its good that appears to crank up the gears and makes you sit up from your seat towards the end but it's only for 10 mins and finishes with a wimper when it had the position in the story to do so much more.I have a feeling there is a lot that didn't make the final cut. The film is a journey to track kidnapped people similar to maybe the searchers but when they reach the destination it should of been the final third of the film rather than the very brief 20 mins we in fact get of the stories climax.,Bone Tomahawk

304,serpent_coil,Boring and over the top,1,20 October 2016,"So, the premise is fairly classic. Indians abduct some people from an isolated western town, a group of men led by the sheriff goes after to get them back. The movie seemed interesting to me because of the combo horror/western and the cast containing some high ranking actors and a good IMDb score. So why was this movie a gigantic let down? Well, first of all it's not a horror movie. Sure, there are some gory scenes but 95% of the movie is just the rescue party riding through the desert and chatting by the campfire. Doesn't have to be a problem, lots of great movies are dialogue heavy and still manage to keep interest and suspense going. Unfortunately this movie has terrible, terrible dialogue. The writing is so stiff and woody it comes off as parodic. OK, maybe it's historically accurate, but the dialogue consists of endless conversations that in the end lead nowhere, doesn't advance the plot and doesn't really reveal anything about the characters. The acting is OK given what they had to woe with I guess... Quentin Tarantino has the talent to write long, seemingly directionless dialogue and still make it flow and be interesting. Lots of less talented filmmakers try to emulate this only to fail miserably. That's my best guess as to why this movie falls so flat. The over the top violent end of the film only highlights the heavy-handedness of the script as it varies from two extremes. Boring and over the top in the same movie. Don't watch this.",Bone Tomahawk
305,TheSwedishJFK,A cult classic,9,23 November 2020,"Westerns is the first film genre I was introduced to and the closest one to my heart. It all started with the tv-show Bonanza and it went from there to the films of John Wayne, the spaghetti westerns and finally to my favorite film Tombstone. For many decades the genre has been quite weak. But now and again there comes a long a gem or two that make me believe that the genre will always be alive and forever evolving.
When Bone Tomahawk came out, I was very skeptical. I thought that it would just be a violent gorefest. That was not the case.The films story is very straight forward. A woman and a young deputy sheriff have been kidnapped by cannibals. Four men, a sheriff, the woman's husband, a gunslinger and a confused old man take on the mission to find them.
I was so determined about believing this film would begin to be brutal in the first ten minutes. Instead it has a slow but satisfying pace. We get to learn the rugged old sheriff who is played by a lowkey and simply perfect Kurt Russell. The other three men in the party is played by Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox and Richard Jenkins. These three actors, who should get much more praise in general, are giving career-best performances. Their chemistry together with Kurt Russell is just magical.When the plot finally starts moving faster with more action and gore it does not disappoint. There is plenty of gore in the film which it is famous for. But it is mostly concentrated in one scene. I think that the use of gore is so effective here. They do not miss-use it all the time. That leads to a much more horrific experience when it eventually happens.Finally, I just want to say that if you are interested in new approaches to genre-films, this is a must-see. S. Craig Zahler gives us such a rich blend of horror, drama and western that you can not label this film with one genre. It Is just Bone Tomahawk, an instant cult classic in my humble opinion.",Bone Tomahawk

The acting is a very high quality. This film works at a number of different levels. It evokes the spirit and feeling of a classic western like the searchers but also has a sinister undertow which hints at a greater menace lurking in the background. The characters are really well drawn and as the film progresses, the bond between them grows naturally. There is genuine horror in this movie also and the protagonists are scary on a human level. Kurt Russell is superb in this film as is his sidekick Richard Jenkins. It almost seems unfair to single out anyone as there are no weak performances in this piece of work.

Surprisingly, it seems to be an obscure gem even though it's a new release with an excellent cast. I think the problem is that it's too violent and gruesome in its later half to appeal to old fashioned Western fans, but for horror fans, there's not quite enough bloody mayhem, or soon enough. So, for genre purists, it might be a hard sell.However, if you just like a really well written movie with great characters and gut-wrenching action, this is the film for you. There is something special about the script. It has a Tarantino vibe, but a little classier, a little more subtle. The main characters are excellent, too, and much of the film's success comes from their interactions and dynamic that comes from their differences.This movie is the kind of magic you get when you let a talented writer and film maker do their thing.

There's lots of witty and wry banter among the characters as they embark on a mission to save people being held captive by cannibalistic troglodytes. Yes, that's what I said. The first two acts play like a fairly conventional western, but holy crap, the third act is like Sam Raimi and John Capenter on overload as it becomes more and more over the top. It has some Tarantino-esque vibes and some cheesy sets (particularly a cave with primitive prison cells) that help make the movie fun.

317,Furrystoat,Closest to realism in a Western film yet,9,22 December 2020,"How refreshing it was to see a Western that comes close to an accurate depiction of the actual levels of depraved, barbaric brutality against white settlers that were committed by Indians on a routine basis. Although the film naturally took great pains to cast the most brutal acts as an anomaly and not representative of the norm, anyone who has studied American history at all and in particular the practices of the native tribes knows that the specific acts depicted in the most gory parts of the film were not only commonplace but rather mild when compared with what was actually done to each other as well as to the white settlers. The film makers should be commended for having the courage to make such an effort in the direction of realism in these politically-correct times and Kurt Russel in particular should be applauded for being a part of a film that will probably never be permitted to be made again. Excellent acting throughout, and the writers did the best that they could in these truth-averse times.

318,ianmitchell-45214,I really enjoyed this film. Caught me by surprise.,9,20 July 2016,"I'm not going to give you guys a professional review. I'll give you an honest account of why I rate it so high. At least you know I'm not trying to sell it too much.The only reason I even gave this film was for a few reasons: - 1: It had an interesting title. Bone Tomahawk... It's intriguing isn't it? I like these kinds of titles because they give a hint of something different and innovative. Not going to rant about other films but titles like 'Sinister' and 'The Conjuring' just sound a bit normal to me I guess 2: The good rating on IMDb. Yes, I know it is not a good idea to do this but I gave it a go because it has the horror genre and is rated above 6. I think at the time I was planning on watching it the rating was at about 8 I think. 3: Lili Simmons is in it. I don't fancy her or wanted to see it to see her nude. I was just curious because I've been thoroughly enjoying the series Banshee and I'm checking out where the Banshee cast are also starring in.Onto the movie. I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I thought it was going to be corny and similar to Hateful Eight. I guess the fact Kurt Russell looks exactly like he does in the Tarantino epic gave me this impression. The film had a very authentic feel to it in many ways. It comes down to the dialogue. The way the main characters chat to each other in a conversational tone (especially the old geezer who rambles on during their cross country walk) was a breath of fresh air in my humble opinion. I've been enjoying The Walking Dead TV series but the dialogue in that show can be very wooden and over;y dramatic. This can be annoying in American TV shows because it is not realistic for everybody to make powerful poignant lines of dialogue all the time.Another aspect I liked in this film was the lack of music. Films have this habit of spoon-feeding us how to feel at certain moments. The only time I even noticed the background sound was during the most disturbing scene (AND MY GOD IT SHOCKED ME!!) in which I think this weird low frequency sound started rumbling. I suppose the reason I really enjoyed this film is because I had no hype leading up to it nor did I check out reviews or spoilers. This is probably the best way to watch a movie really. Overall I highly recommend it. The film is quite long and maybe some might find it boring but I didn't. I just let the movie take me on the same journey as the four men.Best horror film I've seen since The Kill List....",Bone Tomahawk
319,karmicboom,Tombstone meets Cannibal Holocaust,8,21 June 2020,"A truly effective blend of old-school western and exploitation horror that never feels cheap or contrived. The script is very well-written (it's reminiscent of the Coen Brothers, at times) and is filled with witty and sometimes very funny dialogue, and the actors all bring their A-game. The film is deliberately paced. It spends a lot of time setting up the characters and allowing the audience to get to know them, before diving headfirst into a nightmarish and gruesome third act that's right out of a Ruggero Deodato film. Probably the best blend of genre I've seen since From Dusk Till Dawn. Highly recommended",Bone Tomahawk
320,royalewcheese11,One of the best films of the decade so far.,9,18 February 2016,"My two favorite films of 2015 not only stand above the rest quite comfortably, but also happen to be extremely similar in both nature and quality. The fact that these two films share so many resemblances makes comparisons rather difficult to avoid. They are both unpredictable, dialogue-driven and occasionally brutal Westerns starring Kurt Russell, and edited by Fred Raskin. However, unlike Quentin Tarantino's larger-scale The Hateful Eight, a mere $1.8 million budget and three weeks of shooting were all it took to bring writer/director S. Craig Zahler's wonderfully refreshing feature film debut Bone Tomahawk to screens – and not enough screens, at that.Along with being advertised as a ""Horror Western"", the budget may initially give the impression of a mildly entertaining B-movie at best. However, using mostly outdoor locations and a simple olden-time village for its set pieces, the low budget does not hurt the film to any grating degree. Although the small town ironically named Bright Hope may at times feel more like a tourist attraction recreating the 1800s than an actual piece of history, the film's limitations make its greater accomplishments even more impressive. It may somewhat live up to its advertised cross-genres on account of its riveting tension and shockingly gory violence, but rather than providing schlocky scares or excessive shootouts, it instead utilizes its lesser production value to tell an exciting story revolving around character above all else.The straightforward plot surrounds four brave men who set out on a mission to rescue some villagers kidnapped by evil Indian cave-dwelling cannibals. This does indeed become as gruesome as it sounds, but the effect is completely earned by thorough character development in the writing and strong lived-in performances bringing them to life. In order to be invested when we witness the savage acts of ripping body parts and flesh out of the protagonists, they first need to be fleshed out themselves. Zahler does a commendable job of detailing each one with their own individual quirks, values and motivations while maintaining a sense of mutual respect among the group, even when small conflicts arise between them.Russell is subtly captivating as a sheriff who, even amid deadly circumstances, never hesitates to carry on with his duties, because that is what he considers the job to be no matter what: his duty. Patrick Wilson sells the determination and agony of a crippled man who will stop at nothing to save his wife, and Matthew Fox is a sly delight as a cocky gunfighter who can stir the pot on occasion but still honors his allies at the end of the day. Best of all is a nearly unrecognizable Richard Jenkins as the simpleminded and talkative yet irresistibly funny and endearing old back-up deputy who completely abides by his title, providing total support for the sheriff at all times. The first two-thirds of the film mostly consist of conversations between this central quartet as they alternate from riding their horses to setting up camp, and eventually to walking on foot. These naturally paced exchanges are consistently engaging and often humorous, while demonstrating an uncommonly sophisticated precision of realistic language that would be used in this setting. Over the course of their journey, we become surprisingly attached to these characters which, in accompaniment with the overarching sense that anything could happen to them at any time, keeps us on the edge of our seats when danger inevitably emerges.Bone Tomahawk is a clear-cut example of the right way to create a suspenseful and thrilling cinematic experience without the need for expensive effects or consistent action. With well-rounded characters, deliberate pacing, practical makeup and the utilization of sound with hardly any musical score complementing the tension, it succeeds not only in emitting a threateningly unsettling atmosphere but also in establishing a connection to the viewer that results in pleasure at some moments and unforced emotion at others. Zahler's direction is unvarnished and unflinching, focusing no more attention on decapitations and ripped-in-half bodies than on casual ramblings about flea circuses or reading in the bathtub. He knows and trusts that the audience can identify the difference in narrative significance between campfire chats and bones being rammed down our heroes' throats without having to ram it down ours. He has made a gem of a film that should not be overlooked. ""We'll make sure all this has value"", the sheriff reassures. I feel I must echo the armed gentleman's response by imploring filmgoers: ""Please do.""",Bone Tomahawk

I don't know how it managed a 7.1 on IMDb but what do I know? There is no great story line to this movie its flat and plodding with slow though simple to understand dialogue. I feel that the humour that's there is forced and has no punch. I never felt either that I was rooting for our four man band or too worried about the heroine as there was no real sense of urgency or danger. As a horror / western it is probably in the B movie bracket. There is nothing special or to write home about in this film ""so move on there people there's nothing to see here"".",Bone Tomahawk
322,AJRX97,The Hills Have Eyes meets Tombstone,9,26 December 2020,"I don't really know how else to describe this other that the title.The movie is just interesting to watch. The filmmakers keep you in suspense for most of it, with about 65% of this movie being the main characters' journey.The basic premise is this:
There's an ancient tribe of native Americans who have become, as one character describes them, abominations. Like I said, think Hills Have Eyes. Their sacred land is disturbed at the beginning of the movie by two criminals. They kill one, the other escapes and shows up in a small western town. Kurt Russell plays a tough, no nonsense sheriff and he takes down the drifter with a bullet to the leg. The towns doctor - whose husband is played by the great and underrated Patrick Wilson - is among three people abducted by the abominations in the middle of the night, leaving Kurt Russell to round up a posse to go find them.I watched this with a friend who said the middle of the movie was too boring, but the fact is if you like westerns, you shouldn't feel bored by this at all, no more so than the journey sequences in True Grit or Hostiles. Back in the old west, moving a great distance took time and this shows it. Think back to I Am Legend. We don't need to see the ""zombies"" every waking moment to feel the tension of knowing that they're there.Once this movie gets going, it embraces its horror element and will be sure to satisfy you gore lovers. The final 30 minutes are truly excellent and the dialogue and acting throughout is top notch. This movie feels less of a horror movie set in the old west and more of a western movie with a horror story.Definitely recommend!",Bone Tomahawk

The characters may be a bit stiff, but that fits the quiet western setting where language (I would imagine) probably is as thoughtfully constructed as are all other aspects of frontier life. At the same time, the acting (esp. Richard Jenkins) is great. If the second act drags a bit the third pays off.

Much of the dialog and situations were stolen from other films. ugh. This film was so boring, that I can only rate it a ""C"", and that's being generous.

It's a classically crafted western that ended up as a brutal cannibal masterpiece.At first it does make the audience feel that theirs not much happening compared to general modern cinema but what we do have is quality acting, cinematography and script building up to the shocking and unpredictable end I can't recommend this enough, unlike most films of today it's not made for profit it's made for quality film making, something which I fear today is few and far betweenGo watch it",Bone Tomahawk
327,rhino1374,Well worth the watch.,8,24 October 2015,"This was a refreshing take on the modern western. I say modern western but to me it was a return and an evolution of those I used to watch with my grandfather when I was younger. It had to me aspects of ""There Will Be Blood"" and one of my all time favorite movies that also starred Mr. Kurt Russell ""Tombstone"".The graphic nature of this film was realistic, and the attitudes of the characters were indicative of this time and place. It is definitely not a film for those weak of heart or who are easily offended by true accounts of how things were in our collective history. That aside the story had some points when it dragged but never to a place where you lose interest. The performances of the actors were of high quality and believable.It is my opinion that if you have a craving for a good western along the lines of ""Tombstone"" or ""3:10 to Yuma"" and like realistic portrayals of rugged characters you should watch this diamond in the ruff.",Bone Tomahawk
328,bruyve,Rare entry in the western/horror genre ... and a good one,7,8 February 2017,"The plot of ""Bone Tomahawk"" is deceptively slight: terror hits a small western US township when two residents go missing, apparently kidnapped by cannibal natives. A posse of four men go out to save the day, with mixed results. Yet that synopsis hardly does the movie justice as, unusually for horror movies at least, the characters are well-rounded and the acting is almost uniformly excellent.Some may find the gorier scenes on display hard to take, but seasoned horror movie viewers will see nothing more shocking than they've seen many times before. The key differences here are that the viewer cares about the main characters, understands their motivations, and can see the logic in their actions. If only all horror movies had these qualities.The pedestrian pace may irk a few viewers, though the main criticism is the rather anti-climatic ending. The cannibals show little inclination to avoid gunfire, and after a brief skirmish the action, and the movie, peter out. This is gripe aside, few lovers of either genre will be truly disappointed by ""Bone Tomahawk"".",Bone Tomahawk
329,Niik_Flix,Bone Tomahawk missed its throw,3,9 January 2016,"Kurt Russell is the man, you could place him in any role and he'd be awesome. But what the in the world did I just watch? This was just weird. People have been boasting a gritty horror western but all I saw was cheesy and not to mention gross. There was no suspense, they tried but it was very predictable. Characters were great; there was a nice diversity between them all and I think the actors were perfect for their parts. My biggest confusion though, is the purpose of this film. There was no story here at all, no moral at the end or thought provoking moment. An event does not count as a story; you need to go a little deeper. These villains were seriously large cavemen that ate people. When a character died I never felt bad for them, I felt bad for myself once because I watched someone get cut in half like a hog in a butcher shop. Being gross doesn't count as horror. Everyone can have a dark mind and come up with horrible deaths; the question is if you can make the audience clinch the arms of their chairs in suspense and them scared. The cinematography was okay, nothing crazy but certainly not bad. The town and terrain were very cool and believable. I just don't understand why they made this film. I felt like I went to a fancy restaurant and all they served was grilled cheese.",Bone Tomahawk

Besides a single awesome trope, there aren't any original specialties about this western, leaving it without that sense of wonder a movie with this type of premise needs to have. That it somehow promises it will have. It's like if Mad Max: Fury Road only had 5% of its weirdness, of its originality. And it seems like it could've been a Fury Road for westerns. Yet the makers didn't have enough creativity or bravery to step on the imagination paddle. Almost like they didn't care to.Only one character doesn't feel like a stereotype, and while the acting is on point for the majority of the time, the generic sentences drown out the unique exchanges just with their sheer numbers. You do end up caring about the outcome, which is why the third act is so disappointing in the end. Other thing that didn't help is that music is missing from the film completely, probably due to the director's inexperience. This is a movie that will surely be remade in 20 to 30 years as it had mass potential but misfired.Only for the hardcore western enthusiasts.",Bone Tomahawk

The movie is a slow burn for the majority, with the third act stepping up a little with the violence.It did take itself as a serious type of Western, which at first I thought would not work, but ended up being pulled off well. The more time spent into the story, the more serious and horrific situation we actually find the characters are in.Probably not for everyone, but I found it refreshing, without all the fast paced, CGI induced coma styles that most movies try to impress us with these days.

338,burymeonline,Small town settlers go up against a terrifying clan of cave-dwelling cannibals.,9,8 November 2015,"Western horrors are few and far between. They really don't come along often, and it's such a pleasurable meshing of genres when they do that nailing it only serves to heighten the experience. This one was a real curve-ball of a surprise, I have to admit. Starts out with a brief but creepy introduction to our lethally predatory antagonists before ruggedly commencing into a sawdust-on- the-floor-western, which gradually descends into gruesome horror towards the final act. Patrick Wilson pulls out all the stops as the crippled hubby looking to rescue his wife, whose stubborn determination to locate and recover his beloved, and keep up with the more able-bodied rescue party despite his afflictions is heart- rendingly portrayed, utilising a nifty twist towards the end to give him an unexpected and much needed upper hand. Kurt Russell is as ever is on form as the sheriff leading the search and rescue mission, with the almost useless but loyal assistance of a nearly unrecognisable Richard Jenkins as his doddery old deputy. As I mentioned earlier, the horror takes a while to turn up, but the journey there is a real authentically period treat of character acting, and when the darkness does arrive it brings with it a particularly gruesome death, and without giving too much away, there's an astoundingly well written heroic final line that almost brings tears to your eyes, if not at least an approving air-punch. Each person cast is a joy to watch, bringing their own eccentricities, pretensions, and reliability to the table. Hell even Sean Young holds her own in her brief appearance. I thoroughly enjoyed this. It does what films are ultimately meant to do: Tell a cracker of a story.",Bone Tomahawk
339,jantriska-63546,A weird thrill ride,7,10 January 2017,"Saw this, finally, and I was intrigued but also impressed...and yet a bit disappointed, by the time the film ended. It is a mix of a classic Western, a buddy movie (or, rather, a movie about dynamics of a small group), a kind of a slowly unfolding disaster movie, and a horror film, with a 'creature feature' aspect to it. The acting I found to be solid. The characters were somewhat developed but kind of left half-finished. The sheriff's and his posse journeying into the eventual lair of cannibalistic cave dwellers is well depicted; there's tension, as well as entertainment. It does drag on too long. The cannibal troglydotes are freaky - but quite unbelievable. The viewer doesn't learn anything about them or their origins expect for the fact they're damn good at killing, butchering and eating humans (and maybe a few other animals). And, of course, the good guys win, overpowering and outsmarting the cave-dwelling baddies. So, let's talk about the cave-dwelling baddies. Are they some strange clan of white settlers gone totally astray? Are they a forgotten and ostracized sub-tribe of Native Americans? Are they mutants or aliens? Not much of a hint here. I would have preferred even a short backstory about them. As some other viewer has remarked, if this is the 1890s, why are the man-eaters not cleverly using guns instead of spears, bone tomahawks and clubs? Why are they so Neanderthal instead of maybe being simple inbred rednecks who munch on the occasional fellow Wild West traveler? (Here, I am thinking IF there were cannibals on the American frontier then, they would have resembled the bad rednecks from 'Deliverance' rather than some creature from 40,000 years ago). Anyhow, the director tried to make a mash up of two or three genres and produced a kind of a cult film. I like my Westerns straight-up and I like horror movies like 'Alien' where it's more of a reptilian or some completely non-human creature, so it didn't appeal to me on that level. It did appeal to me as a journey film and as a statement on how far people are willing to go. Kurt Russell is continuously appearing in movies these days, being basically Kurt Russell- wouldn't it be great to be him?",Bone Tomahawk
340,phil-37442,A posse pursues a cannibalistic tribe who has kidnapped three town-folk.,9,30 December 2015,"This is one hell of a movie. This movie is definitely character-driven. This is not some mindless, gore-filled slasher flick. The dialog is terrific and the language, attitudes, and perspectives are genuine Old West. This movie makes the characters very sympathetic and you really feel for their suffering and determination. They are also distinctly individual and not Hollywood cookie-cutter stereotypes. This is a true iconoclastic western that breaks all the stereotypes, tropes, memes, and any other lazy writing tricks and develops a truly original product. I found myself holding my breath and sitting on the edge of my proverbial seat waiting to see what would happen next. This is not a movie to just vicariously satisfy 21st century blood-lust, but to tell a story about human endurance, determination, and courage. The first scene exemplifies the intensify when it shows a sleeping cowboy getting his throat cut in the first fifteen seconds after the initial credits. The center section in which the posse takes a few days to track the tribe to their home valley, may drag for some people, but it shows the posse's determination to suffer hardships and endure suffering in order to rescue their friends. There is not much gore for fans of gore, but that would not contribute significantly to the plot in any case. However, there is one scene in which the cannibals consume a captive (I won't say which) that will satisfy gore-fans desire for blood, torment, and intensity.I won't continue out of fear of giving away too much and because I could write about this movie in depth for some time.

Kurt Russell is one of my favorite actors and he's probably the only one that could've pulled this role off in my opinion. The rest of the cast is not as famous as Kurt but they flow well together.

By the end of the film, I found myself cursing that I hadn't watched it sooner and let it sit there all the time. With an attention-grabbing ending, the director makes it a point to not let you leave your seat until the end, with great performances by Kurt Russell (no stranger to a great western), Richard Jenkins (as his backup deputy), Matthew Fox (who makes it a point to utilize his performance like one utilizes bullets in a gun: a controlled rate that makes you yearning for the next shot from him), and Patrick Wilson, whose character arguably has the most to lose in the worst possible circumstances. At some point in the film, after an already interesting ride, the film's principal genre switches from western to horror, which makes the audience, like the main characters, hold on just long enough to try and see how it all ends.In short, this film is worth your time, and maybe you'll hopefully realize it sooner than later.",Bone Tomahawk

All actors were on song here and enjoyed seeing Kurt Russell playing in another western, this part suited him perfectly, Matthew fox also played a good part along with the underrated Richard Jenkins. What i like about this film is that the story is given time to breed not rushed and you get into the characters although i would have like to see Matthew's fox's characters fleshed out a bit more. I'd say 90% of this movie is a western and 10% horror, the scenes of which (particulary one) are gruesome but not long drawn out scenes that you see in some movies just for shock value. this is 9 out of ten for me well worth at watch using a good old style western with a little twist",Bone Tomahawk

Some of the more graphic scenes made me wince, but they were part of the story and not just for the sake of it; they showed plainly what happened to people when they were caught by some tribes back then.To be honest, concentrating on the gruesome bits would be to miss the great story telling, humour from the old timer and selflessness.

Reminds me of a 70's 'journey to the centre of the earth' type of film - no disrespect to that film, it was great in it's day, and sadly this would have been just as great back then as well. The story was just bad - corny and drawn out, as if the author/script writer ran out of ideas and then padded it out with completely irrelevant rubbish. In fact it was so boring I am finding it hard to fulfil the 10 line quota - oh I know, I sat willing the film to get better - but it didn't.

A far cry, really. Sadly, it took me an hour to realize I was watching the wrong movie.
It is sad to realize, retrospectively of course, that the producer could have told the writer to redo the script into a parody like TROPIC THUNDER (2008). Because it is the type of story that is parodied in Tropic Thunder, or maybe even worse: here we have disenfranchised characters no one really cares about, dull dialogue, boring scenes, lack of common sense, and mindless fake gore.

351,jailbirdtri,"A rare, but effective blend of genre's.",8,29 December 2015,"My Rating: 7.5/10 A rock-solid western in the beginning, Bone Tomahawk transforms midway to become one of the most gruesome horror movies this year. It's not an unlikely combination. There have been a few titles in the past that falls under the western-horror category, but not many of them delivered so well.Written and directed by S. Craig Zahler, the movie has a smart and tight screenplay. Zahler's story is unflinching and he never dilutes the intensity of what is shown on-screen. He succeeds in maintaining an air of unpredictability throughout the whole feature, and yes Zahler's name is definitely something to look out for in the future.The story is set in the American old west, maybe during the end of 1800's. Four men are on a mission to rescue a few kidnapped people from a tribe of inbred man-eating savages. The quartet includes The Sheriff of the town Franklin Hunt (Kurt Russell), an injured Cowboy Arthur O' Dwyer (Patrick Wilson) whose wife Samantha O' Dwyer (Lili Simmons) is one among the captives, an armed gentleman John Brooder (Matthew Fox) and the Backup Deputy Chicory (Richard Jenkins).The casting is okay but not great. The veteran actors Kurt Russell and Richard Jenkins give their best. Russell gives a fine performance as the Sheriff, making the whole premise believable. Jenkins' character Chicory might be the most likable of all and his role feels so natural and belonged in the whole plot. Patrick Wilson does a commendable effort, and so does Mathew Fox. The only character that appears to be misplaced is the town doctor Samantha O' Dwyer played by Lili Simmons. Her performance doesn't seem to blend in the 1800's period.The cannibals were nightmarishly original. And their savagery is not just spoken of; rather it is shown in detail. The camera doesn't shift around much when it comes to the bloody violence. The eerie atmosphere together with the unpredictably quick turnarounds makes the feature quite effective. A major plus of this movie is that it sticks to being as realistic as possible. Be it the dialogues, the situations, the acting or even the gut-wrenching violence and gore, Bone Tomahawk is realism to the bone.Recommended watch, if you can sit through a good old, slow paced, formal talked western in the former half and all the bloody gore in the later half, but ultimately the movie pays off.",Bone Tomahawk

Sadly he's barely in this movie and the opening scene gave way to a much slower paced hour where not a lot happens outside of some pretty good dialogue here and there.The second hour really picks up though and is where the meat of the movie lies. The tribals were genuinely horrifying and I did feel worried for the characters which I haven't felt during a horror movie in a very long time. The movie did feel authentic due to some decent acting and setting. The most impressive thing about this movie is its 1.8 million dollar budget.

360,An_Irish_Guy,Cinematic Brutality,8,4 November 2015,"Sitting down to watch 'Bone Tomahawk' I was excited, the concept was clever, unique. The opening scene immediately sets the tone for the rest of the film, it's graphic, brutal and relies on realism for its shocks. It is not, however, the only thing that is given to us in this movie. The ironically named small western town of Bright Hope that is presented to us shows us the humanity in the characters we are introduced to, with 3 people on the police force it's clear bright hope doesn't have much trouble makers, which makes what's to follow all the more shocking. The 'troglodytes' are portrayed masterfully, they behave like wild animals, everything they do is so astronomically different from the people of Bright Hope that it makes them seem almost supernatural, those blood curdling howls will stay in your mind for a few nights to come. Bone Tomahawk's real success does come from its realism, it's shocking brutality and managing to avoid the all out killing spree we've become so accustomed to in horror films, this is what leads me to give this film an 8/10. It is definitely worthy of fitting in to the horror genre, some of the deaths will haunt your nightmares, but there is undeniably good character arcs, an entertaining story and great acting performances amongst all the insanity, Bone Tomahawk is definitely worth a watch.",Bone Tomahawk

These characters couldn't be any more 1-dimensional. The dialogue was excruciatingly forced, falling flat. There was literally no character development. No arc. Really? This entire category felt totally uninspired. Kurt Russell was fine, hard for him to be ""bad"" in anything. Matthew Fox was particularly stale. The rest of the cast was present. Directing/Cinematography/Editing: A previous reviewer mentioned that this was a ""paint by numbers"" film, and the director ""must hate close-ups"". Completely agree. This had b-movie written all over it. Long takes where they didn't need to be. Lack of camera adjustments. Poorly composed shots.Creativity: For the most part I find it lacking. Just because you jam multiple genres together, doesn't mean you've done something special. I will however give the director kudos on the gruesome kills; though few and far between.If you want to see a western with good dialogue, starring Kurt Russell, go watch The Hateful Eight.Want to see a slow western, with actual character development and trekking across the American west?

364,hammit,"A fresh, original blend of genres that results in a new cult classic!",9,2 November 2015,"This film is a great example of what Hollywood is sorely lacking these days: Originality! Like other reviewers have mentioned, this is slow burning western/horror flick that keeps building the suspense until the finale. It's not an edge-of-your-seat thriller that is loaded with action, but it has enough to keep your interest. It has more of a typical western feel to it in terms of character development. The dialogue is spot on for this genre. The acting is superb and plot is genuine. I think that it speaks volumes about the script given the fact that the actors signed on for minimum pay (that means they WANTED to be in this film for the script and plot). The gore is definitely there for the horror fans, although I would say that if you are seeking a lot of gore, you may be disappointed. It does have some that is pretty graphic. I definitely would not let children or even some teenagers watch this, its an adult movie. If you are a fan of westerns, I think you'll like it a lot. If you are a Kurt Russell fan, you will not be disappointed (this was his first western since Tombstone). Patrick Wilson and Matthew Fox make an excellent supporting cast and demonstrate their acting skills well. This is a new cult classic!",Bone Tomahawk
365,specfor2,Off the HOOK!,9,11 November 2016,"This is one of the best 'horror' movies I have watched in quite some time. Some people don't like the really slow pace for the majority of the films length. But believe me, stick with it. The story is pretty basic, I really liked the soundtrack and the acting. Kurt Russell is great, and Richard Jenkins is perfect. Watching Patrick Wilson suffer through the whole journey is pretty brutal and who doesn't like the bad ass character, played by Matthew Fox? Aside from some violence at the beginning, there isn't much until the s*** hits the fan. I won't even say when it starts, because that's the beauty of this movie, at least for me, I almost forgot I was supposed to be watching a horror. Then WHAM, the violence begins and it is savage! So do yourself a favour, if you have read no spoilers, just go watch the movie. The less you know the better.

367,adam-1093,Wasted opportunity and poor executed flop... Do not waste your time watching it,1,21 August 2018,"I rarely write reviews as surely not being close to ok writer or entertainment journalist, but had to voice disappointment about this movie and odd high rating which tricked me into wasting my time watching it.....First of all I am not taking anything from creators of the movie and effort made. I realise and always appreciate craft, creative efforts and overall production processes and values are big challenges in long run. Yet I was terribly surprised that with such good & established casted actors director and script writers managed to deliver such awful result. It is awful on almost every level of movie making. It could not even be salvaged by overall actors performances, and gosh you can tell they tried their best, especially Kurt Russel and Richard Jenkins. So lets start with basics.... 
Poorly designed interiors and town overall, on a budget for sure with props being dropped randomly used from prop house. Purely for that reason they lack authentic feel of the era and just look rushed and faked. 
Outdoors locations could be so much more considering idea of movie and they ended up looking as they were shot on some local hilly back yard of farmhouse... Few dusty hills and never ending tight shots of corners of small valleys...Cinematography is mostly below average. I mean it. Few shots are beautiful but they cannot take away 95% of just poor visual story telling. What happened to basic rules of composition ?! 
As mentioned before script is flawed with gaps which are hard to explain. they leave more question marks and head scratching rather than create plot which follows and makes sense. Dialogs seems to be quite coincidental as well as characters relationships and placement. Actors tried to create believable portrayals and you can tell their did their best but half of the movie they ended up flat and out of place. There is mere authenticity in story itself and there is no plot twist as well. Some gory scenes that ad just brutality rather than any essence to story. I was quite angry with myself that I committed to watch this movie to the end. 
Please do not repeat my mistake. Movie is low budget creation and overrated. 4/10",Bone Tomahawk
368,jess_palacios,A powerful combination of realistic western and horror cannibal movie,8,14 October 2015,"I just see yesterday night the movie at the Sitges Fantastic Film Festival of Catalunya, and I only can praise the insight of his director and writer. As a great fan of both, dirty & twilight westerns of the seventies and horror splatter movies, I found very natural that combination, as we see a couple of times before. But I have to say that the fine drawing of characters, a little bit a la ""Unforgiven"", in combination with the slow but atmospheric and realistic pace of the timing, plus the brutal and gory explosion of final violence and crude action, works absolutely superbly, better than I expected. As personal variation on the classic cannibal Italian movies of the 80s, I think its a lot more honest and stylish than, by the way, Eli Roth's ""The Green Inferno"", and as twilight western with tragic and violent overtones, it remind me the best western ever made about the confrontation between white men and native Americans in the last Frontier times: Robert Aldrich's ""Ulzana's Raid"". If you like splatter survival from the 70s and 80s, and melancholic, demystifying, sad and violent westerns, if you read books like Jack Ketchum's ""The Crossings"" (wich is very much alike) and appreciate weird westerns as Mulligan's ""The Stalking Moon"", this is your movie.",Bone Tomahawk

It picks up pace and becomes so brutal, and oddly intimate. It's one of those stories where it's got wonderfully acted characters, who you don't even need to love, that get you rooting for them because you can see why they do what they do. And it all just falls into place to deliver an unruly, painful, and disgusting narrative. If you like freaky stuff, and fantastic horror, it's really hard to find a reason to say this isn't worth a watch.Even if you're not largely into horror, as long as gore doesn't spook you, it's still 100% worth the watch.",Bone Tomahawk
370,wishpishh,Distressingly effective,7,1 February 2020,"I have such mixed feelings for this film. On the one hand, it masterfully gets to me, and on the other hand I kind of wish I could un-see it. I came in to this completely cold. I knew it was a different, edgy and pretty violent Western. And it starts off just so, and keeps going that direction for most of the movie. But then it catches you completely off guard and totally messes you up. That scene which I have now learned is infamous really stuck to my mind, to the extent that for several days since I saw the movie it still really bothers me and makes me feel truly unnerved. I have probably even lost sleep because of it. And that's coming from someone who usually isn't very affected by gruesome horror (I've also seen some of the cannibal movies that this is sometimes compared to). This tops them all in terms of emotional impact (the emotion being shock and disgust).What makes the movie so effective in its mission to draw you in is that it's very well acted, with great characters that you grow to care for throughout the movie. As the horrific stuff really gets going (and good lord, it's horrific), the performances, the sound design and the unflinching camera really sells it. It feels totally real and utterly nihilistic. So if the goal of the movie is to scar its audience, then it passes with flying colors.And still, if you close your eyes (and ears) during those scenes you still get a very enjoyable and solid Western movie with great script and production with some great performances by good actors.",Bone Tomahawk

372,rdevine_az,Good performances. poor script,6,9 January 2016,"The performances by the cast were good considering the weakness of the script. It seems Kurt Russell has found his niche in these westerns. His character in this film was similar to his role in ""Tombstone"" and his more recent performance is Quinten Tarentino's film ""Hateful Eight"".I found Mathew Foxes performance as Brooder to be done well, but the costuming was inconsistent; a debonair Indian fighter?Richard Jenkins character of Chicory was well done and in some ways provided comic relief.And although Lili Simons character was the catalyst for the main storyline, I felt that she was almost a through away character because the story didn't explain why she came into the story. Maybe she was the token woman for the film? The problem with this movie is the story. It dragged at times and did little to develop the characters or tie ends together. It seems that it traded in script for unnecessary gore although the basic storyline had a lot of potential.",Bone Tomahawk

Either you loved it or loathed it -- there is definitely no in-between feeling regarding it. I happened to not only love it but as several reviewers have previously stated, thought it was necessary to show/see it. Just as the middle third of the film feels rather slow and a bit tedious, it is meant to put us, the viewer, in the proverbial shoes of the characters we are watching.

375,TuanHo,One of the worst edited movies I have ever seen.,4,28 December 2015,"The slow pacing of this movie is unbearable. You'd have more fun just closing your eyes and taking a nap to dream about three-titted supermodels or something.Let me now talk about the musical score for the movie. It's almost non-existent. Some scenes are so boringly silent you may as well eat some spicy food and fart as loudly as you can to liven up the atmosphere in this movie while you watch it.Sure, there are films that intentionally have slow build-ups after an exciting opening, e.g. Nolan movies, The Hateful Eight, etc... but this was excruciating.Almost every single scene in the movie lingers on for about 2-3 seconds too long. You'd think it was edited by some first-year film school students. Those extra seconds in every scene add up. If you got rid of those unnecessary seconds, you could easily chop off 10-15 minutes off the running time.I know this movie is low-budget, but couldn't they afford some more extras and better sets? I wonder how much Sean Young got paid for the one minute that she's in this? Whatever it was, it was a waste of money.The only redeeming aspects of this was some of the dialogue: ""Say goodbye to my wife. I'll say hello to yours."" - That was the best line in the movie. Simple and moving.The other great part is the gore. It's graphic and gruesome. I've seen a lot of messed up stuff in my life but the gore in this was very surprising.I still don't understand why so many critics were so kind to this movie. It's actually baffling.",Bone Tomahawk

377,freetheblizz,Perfect Blend of Horror and Country,9,27 October 2015,"So I was excited about this film when I saw the trailer on facebook about three weeks ago. I tempered my optimism by telling myself the mash-ups of genres often fall flat on their face when it comes to movies. So when it came it out I waited a day, didn't read any reviews but saw a quick clip of Gemmi Galactic interviewing Mathew Fox and I thought I better just buckle down and watch the movie already. I can tell you that I wasn't disappointed in the slightest.This film is the perfect blend of country and horror, it does both well. If you are into a tense thriller that ends with a ton of action this movie is for you. It's long for a horror flick almost two full hours, but I never felt restless. The script moved you seamless through the story and the acting was spot on. The Indian cannibals was a really interesting twist and something I enjoyed immensely. The action had the perfect amount of gore, not the over the top kind where blood shots all over the place. The lack of over the top theatrics added a sense of realism to the entire film. It felt as if you were watching something that could have actually taken place. Without the presence of a real supernatural threat this movie did more than hold it's own.Cabalism movies are something that don't catch my interest too often, normally the entire flick rests on the writer trying to use the taboo to make you sick. Often with the director or special effects crews trying to constantly show you people eating other people and pushing you into the boundary between being scared and wanting to turn it off because it isn't scary but is just flat out revolting. You won't find that in Bone Tomahawk, the story and the acting carry the movie, and the brutal violence adds to the realism of the times and the situation they find themselves in.If you are looking for something to watch during this Halloween season you should check this movie out. I would give the movie five out of five stars, or a nine out of ten. It was that good. I think you won't be disappointed with the cost of a rental or the purchase of this movie. Seriously set some time aside and check it out. You will find as a horror fan you recognize more actors than you would have thought for a straight to video movie. I hope we see more of this trend in the future I personally detest the theater and love watching movies in the comfy surroundings of my home.As a side note you know it is good when my wife hides her eyes more than once. I call it the eye test LoL. Next cannibal movie on the list The Green Inferno, let's hope it comes out on video soon.",Bone Tomahawk

I certainly wasn't disappointed. I had heard it was very long that there was a very long set up etc but that didn't discourage me. Simply put it is fantastic which is rare to say of a Hollywood horror film these days. Highly suspenseful and gut wrenching stuff! It's worth every bit of the prolonged set up. I've seen hundreds of horror movies all my life and I found the gore in this borderline unwatchable. If you are a horror fan this is a MUST SEE film! Easily the best horror film Kurt Russell has done since John Carpenter's The Thing in 1982. This film is darker than The Thing though I would say. The film is dripping in foreboding tension and atmosphere. Very long but so worth it. Don't miss this classic horror film!,Bone Tomahawk
380,sarepthora-72263,A tad on the boring side,4,28 August 2021,"Great cast, good acting, but otherwise just a tad on the boring side. The story drags along quite a bit, without barely any moments of actual suspense. There are some gore scenes near the end, and they do make up for most of the boring bits, but by then you most likely will be half asleep already and trying to stay awake till the end. The horrifics nearing the end will jerk you awake for sure and to be honest, the ending is done rather well, but it's all a bit to little to late to be giving this a good overall rating.",Bone Tomahawk

The men of this violent tribe apparently see their female companions as means to an end. At the end of the movie you can see how they are used as human incubators. Lying flat on their backs with amputated arms and legs and stakes driven through their eyes. This image is going to stick with me for a long time... This part of their ideology could have been played out a bit more if you ask me. Missed opportunity there! Same remark for the hills have eyes movies. Overall I thought this one was a bit slow paced. I watched for the horror which didn't really happen till the last part of the film. We only get to see one person getting properly butchered which is too bad for a movie about a cannibalistic tribe. Am I reaching for the stars? I don't think so. After years and years of horror movies I guess I'm just waiting for one that can still shock me. Am I desensitized? Yes, but only in the world of fiction.If you are in the mood for some awkward yet entertaining dialogues alternated by gruesome man-splitting cannibal murder then this is the movie for you.",Bone Tomahawk

No other words best to describe this movie other than to say that this is the best horror/western movie this year and i would venture to say that this movie probably has taken the cup for being the best this year. If you are a fan of horror or western movies then you should definitely check it out. Kurt Russel, Patrick Williams give strong performances. All the four main characters describe one simple notion throughout the movie. Russell--A town sheriff who would do anything to fulfill his duty as a town sheriff and bring the criminals to justice. Williams--A loving husband who would do anything to bring his love back even in the face of immense odds.There are some scenes in this movie which will definitely shock you being so gory and violent and this is coming from me being a long time horror movie fan who is not easily shocked. To give you an idea how certain scenes will be imprinted in your mind for some time is like when you watched the movie Sinister and there were some scenes that you could not forget for a while.Finally do not take my word for it or someone else's and give this movie a try and then decide for yourself.

387,pmuhtaris,A solid effort that pulls no punches,7,30 July 2021,"Bone Tomahawk is a gruesome movie. Not necessarily in the amount of violence but in the intensity. When something happens on screen you're left feeling a little anxious, as the director has chosen not to imbue our heroes (or villains) with unnatural speed and accuracy, a refreshing choice that keeps the pacing realistic, if sometimes a teeny bit docile.I went into this not knowing anything about the movie and was surprised at the way the genre's have been blended here to make a classic Western and a classic horror that sits comfortably between the two genre's without ever showing preference towards either one for too long. The actors, lead by Kurt Russell all give good performances.The characters are all very human, they all have their own story and a background and a personality, though some more interesting than others, but every word spoken seems to flow with purpose, occasionally giving you an insight into those strange thoughts that plague some of people at the oddest times when others, in the same situation, become more stoic. Words aren't wasted and none of the movie is filled in with pointless dialogue.It isn't a perfect film, but it will keep you interested until the end and may even prove otselfto be a modern classic.",Bone Tomahawk

These are some good actors and the movie has an interesting premise, but man oh man was that script bad. The dialogue is just so out of place and sterile that it had me cringing half the time and laughing the rest. I prefer a horror/thriller film to have a solid story, time to form characters, and a nice build to the climax, but the pace of this movie is all wrong. If you're going to spend so much time on conversations and so little time on action, there better be some progressing interest in the characters and a sense of involvement in the story. That just wasn't present with this film, despite the fact that well over half of it is spent in aimless talking and walking. The actors were held back by terrible writing and poor character development throughout the story, leaving us with sub-par acting and uninteresting characters. The general lack of a soundtrack contributes to the overall dullness and sterility of this film. As for scares, there really weren't any, although I will give points for the horror factor with those cave scenes towards the end (shivered and cringed during that stuff). Overall a solid idea with some great actors that just went straight to hell due to the awful writing, particularly the dialogue. Like I said, I really wanted to like this one and stuck with it even after the first 20 minutes made me realize how bad the writing was. But if you just have to find out like I did and find yourself doubting 20 minutes in, trust me, it doesn't get better and it's not worth waiting till the end.",Bone Tomahawk

He ran out of water about the same time I was out of interest. Kurt must be hurting for money to do a horror western film like this. We like Kurt and it had a seven out of ten rating so we thought what the heck. There are too many unanswered questions because the ending stops like a pony dropping of into a canyon. It's horrible but you cannot help but look. The husband and wife don't seem believable as a couple and the wife survived days with cannibals but it doesn't explain any of what happened to her or why. Men with no injuries don't survive but the one really hurt and out of water kills the most? The eating of humans and violence surpassed the capabilities of my mind-it was over the top and distracted from what had the potential to be a good movie.,Bone Tomahawk

I'm just an average guy who likes movies, so don't expect any major techno-babble in this review.Kurt Russell always puts on a solid performance in his movies, and you can expect the same here. The rest of the cast also play their roles out well. The one cast member that had me floored though was Richard Jenkins. His character stole the show as Chicory. I've only and always known him as playing the same straight-laced, proper semi-neutral-good- bad-guy supporting character in every movie I've seen him in (Jack Reacher, Cabin in the Woods, etc.). Believe it or not, though, he actually played this totally out of the ordinary role extremely well and provided much of the comic relief as an old, balding, widower deputy sheriff who rambles on about the oddest things for hours on end.Outside of the acting, the dialog in the movie is quite entertaining. There's lots of ""natural"" humor that just flows with the conversation and events; nothing feels forced, nor should it in a horror/thriller. The dialog has the same feel and is much like the first and the latest ""Tremors"" movies.The downside of this movie, however, is its pacing. It clocks in at over 2 hours and it does a good job at establishing back plots and characters... but it drags at times. There are some scenes that could be condensed into one line of ""And some days later..."" that we're dragged through, coughing up ever dusty rock and tumbleweed as we go along for the ride.It feels like a 90 minute movie that they needed to make longer, so they kept pasting southwestern scenes together until they hit the 2 hour mark.The ending, without ruining anything for all of you, also falls flat. It's a freshman mistake and one that any decent writer/director/screenwriter should know to avoid. But the end left me with the feeling of ""Huh? Is that it?"" and then the credits rolled.Definitely worth 6.5 stars. Could have been closer to an 8 if it didn't drag for so long.",Bone Tomahawk

I'm also someone that really likes the use of silence in films that I watch, it just seemed here often like it was being used without a reason.

And I have enjoyed Patrick Wilson since I first saw him in Watchmen. Together, they are a superb team.The supporting cast - terrific, the writing - marvelous and reminiscent of the Coen Brothers, where Wilson now hangs his hat in Fargo, another bit of similar writing.All in all I was favorably impressed with Bone Tomahawk, which is why I gave it an 8/10.

The sheriff (Kurt Russell), gathers three other men including her husband and go on a rescue mission to save her. A simple plot, but not bad.The movie is mostly driven by conversations and it is a slow burn, because the main story doesn't even start until around a half an hour has passed, but still great dialogue keeps it interesting.I really don't feel that this is a horror movie like a lot of people say it is. There's really no suspense or creepy atmosphere, there's barely any music at all actually, but horror fans might still enjoy this because of the gore and cool kills.As acting goes, it's good, I think all of the actors did a great job, especially Kurt Russell. The only thing that sort of bothered me with this movie is, I felt like I was watching some sort of miniseries that's only 2 hours long. I don't know why, I think it may be something to do with the way it was filmed or the way some things looked, but you guys probably won't have this problem.Overall, if you like Kurt Russell, Westerns, awesome kills and a decent story, check out BONE TOMAHAWK.",Bone Tomahawk

I went to see the movie because i expected a horror movie mainly but as it turned out for me this is more of a western than anything else.I think the first part of the movie is its strongest. I very much enjoyed the characters of the four protagonists and i also think the actors gave a strong performance. I consider the second part from where the protagonists first encounter the cannibals. This was the part that should have made the movie a horror movie but for me it definitely didn't. I was almost surprised by how unscary the cannibals were presented. There are two torture scenes in this movie which i would have found excellent if they just weren't as gory as they were since that did not suit the style of the film at all. I was neither scared nor thrilled at any point of the movie. I was especially annoyed by the emotionless performances of everyone in the second part of the movie. The protagonists don't show any emotion whatsoever and barely seem to care that they are being hunted by cannibals. Also the cannibals seem lazy as hell. For example, during a fighting scene, while his opponent is reloading his revolver, the cannibal casually walks towards his bow and arrow. Also, when cannibals are investigating a suspicious noise it seems more like they are going for a walk than anything else.In conclusion, i think it comes down to what you want to see. If you want to see a western with more than usual gore, this is definitely a movie I would recommend. If, however, you want to see a horror movie with a creepy and scary atmosphere set in the wild west then I would suggest you don't watch this movie since I would barely consider this movie to be a horror movie.I rated this movie as a western, hence the high rating.",Bone Tomahawk

They definitely studded the cast to suit an audience such as myself, including some of my favorites (I mean, who doesn't love Patrick Wilson?) unfortunately the movie was just so drawn out it eventually just became boring. As a viewer, you hope that since it's taking so long to get anywhere there must be something really good coming; like a slow-burning horror. No, no. What we found at the end was just something out of what seems should be another movie maybe? And of course, it was so contrived and stupid that it ended up just being insulting. Not to me. To the actors in it who had to go along with the ridiculousness of it. Literally the only reason I'm giving this even a 2 out of 10 is because of the actors. Good job, guys.",Bone Tomahawk

405,bmwalker-03960,"A brutal, unapologetic delight",9,17 September 2019,"Make no mistake, Bone Tomahawk is not an easy watch. Those of us with light hearts will not find any joy with this film.The performance of the entire cast from top to bottom billing is stellar. Even some of the cast members with smaller parts and, perhaps not known for their acting chops, seem to give maximum effort and it pays. Of course, when speaking of the performances, special mention has to be saved for Kurt Russell. His range and ability to keep you engaged is no more evident than in this movie. Patrick Wilson also gives a strong performance but again, that can be said for everyone involved.The visuals of the old West are immersive and grounded, you feel like you're in the location, and with it, the peril of the situation these characters find themselves in, resonates more. There doesn't seem to be a lot of CGI or studio trickery, even for some of the more gruesome parts which I commend. If something looks like it's been tampered with in post-production, it can be jarring and take you out but this film takes no such steps.My one criticism, and it's a minor one, is the length. The pace is slow which absolutely works in the story's favour, but a slow burning movie at 2hrs and 10mins won't sit well with some people. I totally understand why it's slow paced but had they shaved 10/15 mins off, it probably would have had the same desired effect.This is a film that needs to be experienced and the less I say about plot points, the better. It is 100% worth a watch.Anybody looking for a movie to consume that feels like a storyline in the Red Dead Redemption franchise, this one's for you.",Bone Tomahawk

411,vdipietro4,Too Much Too Late,7,11 January 2016,"Through the majority of Bone Tomahawk, I found myself completely Enthralled. Many may mistake this film for something of a slow burn; and by just considering the plot, they would be right. On the surface, Bone Tomahawk is a linear and semi-predictable film that's not going to turn any heads (this may be why it has been largely overlooked), but it's when we stop looking for the climax that we begin to enjoy the ride.Perhaps more than anything, I believe it was the characters that made me give this film an above average rating. They're age old but new, fitting nicely into predetermined western clichés of the 60's. We have a bewildered husband, an anecdotal old timer, a flare obsessed desperado and of course the morally upright Sheriff. But what these cowboys lack in originality, they more than make up for in dialogue. At some point through the story, I began to enjoy them, perhaps even more than I should. Through sheer dialogue, these gritty cowpokes are able to make even the most boring scene not only memorable, but often enough quotable. My main gripe with bone tomahawk was it's erratic pacing towards the end of the film. In no way, shape or form did the humble and interesting journey seem like the pre-requisite to such a quick action packed ending. This is to say that although the ending was not bad in and of itself, it simply did not fit what I had come to expect from the film. In short: If you're in the mood for a throw-back western with some great dialogue, Bone Tomahawk just may be the film for you.",Bone Tomahawk

It was an agonizing hour and a half at least of them trudging across the plains looking for the kidnapped victims.

416,ward_s,"Haunting, dark, brutal",8,25 October 2015,"Some time back I saw film of an unfolding maritime disaster. A huge freighter loaded down with some mineral ore had miscalculated its approach to the pier and though it was only moving a few feet per minute its unimaginable momentum was sufficient to utterly destroy the pier and other infrastructure. It crept slowly forward, an irresistible force meeting the immovable shoreline. That image came back to me as I finished this film. It moves slowly, resolutely forward, quietly gathering momentum, until it plows to its conclusion in a dark, horrifyingly violent collision. It's a simple story. Members of a clan of primitives have taken a handful of frontier citizens and the lawman leads a ragged posse to go rescue them. Once they reach the camp of the primitives, as one would expect, there is much killing. But it is not a simple film. It is distinguished by its pace and its characters. It starts its journey in familiar territory, a small western town with a rough- hewn lawman (Kurt Russell). There is a killing, a stable boy is eviscerated, and a couple of townsfolk are abducted. The lawman and the townsfolk consider their options. To paraphrase Donald Rumsfeld, you go with the posse you've got, not the posse you wish you had. The lawman and three others set out to do what needs doing. Though, it is a long trip, the film uses this time to its quiet gain, slowly bringing the characters to life and also slowly grinding them down with its sun-scorched terrain and relentless bad luck. These characters are worth getting to know, but some may be tempted to whine from the back seat, ""Are we there yet?"" Trust me, we will get there in time. This is no simple character study, however. The marvelous characters draw you in to their lives and you'd be forgiven for feeling affection for them. The posse slogs inexorably forward. To count up the minutes, there is actually not a lot of violence, but what violence there is is brutal, horrible. It is not splashy Tarantino violence; it reminded me more of John Hillcoat's film, The Proposition. It is dark, gruesome, vividly real. It spills viscera. Bodies drop leadenly. There are no gymnastic escapes. When flesh is torn, you hear it. But what really sets it apart is that after the long trek to get there, you feel you have friends in the fight. The violence feels as close as the pounding in your own chest.",Bone Tomahawk

Briefly, here are some details that liked me most: the rhythm of the whole film, the exact traits of personalities of the characters, the dialogues - maybe too smart in some scenes if we consider the origin of the characters - , the role playing of every actor: flawless.

I watched this movie in good faith, due to a promising cast and many good reviews that I read prior to watching. Unfortunately, although this movie is advertised as horror, it is really, really not. Nothing happens for about 90% of the movie. A movie can be slow paced, yet still interesting, but this movie captures no interest at all and holds no suspense whatsoever. If you value your sanity, don't bother with this movie. Unless you enjoy watching people walking aimlessly and doing absolutely nothing else, nor saying anything interesting either.I gave this movie two stars: 1 for the 10% of the movie where something actually happened, and 1 for coming up with a kind of interesting plot (which was executed horribly.)",Bone Tomahawk

The blending of western with horror kind of put me off. I will however watch anything with Kurt Russell so after reading a review here about this movie, I gave it a try.I enjoyed this movie very much. The pace might seem slow to some but I found it perfect. There is violence and a few scenes are quite gross but they are appropriate for the story being told and I didn't have to cover my face. Since I don't watch many horror movies, I can't comment on how unique the scenes in this movie are but they seemed much different to me than the typical slasher type stuff I have gotten stuck watching a few times.Kurt Russell, as always, is a pure pleasure to watch.",Bone Tomahawk

Shot on a shoestring budget on the Old Paramount Ranch, Kurt shows the kids you don't need fancy, dancy CGI, deafening explosions, smash 'em up car chases, or even a big budget all star cast with some duded-up script, just a good supporting cast and good ol' Kurt doing what good ol' Kurt does best. ... and it works!

It was true to the western genre but it wasn't much of a horror genre, it had some gory moments and I would let the misleading genre slide because of the fantastic plot, great dialogues and unpredictable turn of events.

422,philjanuary,"Really different movie, and not just for the sake of being different",7,30 January 2016,"Bone Tomahawk is a horror western/weird western, that seems to be 2015's big sleeper hit. I was expecting not to like it or give up half way through due to my dislike of horror flicks, so the fact that I loved this really surprised me. Arthur O'Dwyer's (Patrick Wilson) wife Samantha (Lili Simmons) is kidnapped, which sets in motion a very fun western horror tracking down the kidnappers. Arthur, Kurt Russell's Franklin, Matthew Fox's Brooder, and Richard Jenkins's Chicory set out on this adventure.Matthew Fox's Brooder is surprisingly the highlight here. Kurt Russell is great as always. Richard Jenkins is of course brilliant as well, and plays great comedic relief. Even Patrick Wilson is really good, granted he is the weakest link of the 4, but you're up against 3 brilliant actors. Zahn McClarnon, who had the highlight of last year's Fargo playing Hanzee, and also steals the show in the deleted scenes of Awful Nice, shows up for a quick memorable scene here, and is just commanding. I really hope he continues to be in shows and movies, cause he's great to watch. Lili Simmons from Banshee and David Arquette from Ravenous! (among other things) do some of the best work here with their smaller supporting roles.I probably prefer Ravenous when it comes to cannibalistic westerns, but this was a fresh take and interesting to watch.",Bone Tomahawk

There are also two vague incidents while on the hunt for the cannibals between a seemingly friendly Mexican couple, who get killed by Fox, and then an attack on Fox that doesn't seem to wake anyone up...In the end the cannibals actually find the posse and to make it somewhat exciting, there's a ritual of a lot of gore that is in part, hacking a body in half by way of doing it between the legs and then pulling...and then some other gore...All in all, the ratings on IMDB are WAY too high for this movie. I think some of these ratings are written by people involved with this movie or people that get paid to write them.In the end, I was disappointed and, I don't say this very often, but a waste of time and film and the actor's abilities.

Said savages soon also stock their larder with a pretty doctor and a crook and deputy from a another raid on the small townlet of Bright Light.From there expect little blood until nearer the end when the rescue party turn up and are captured themselves. Cue brutal beatings, meal-prep in the form of chopping a (live) deputy in half and a sad escape where they leave one of their own behind (critically injured but functional) to settle the score with the surviving cave-dwellers while the survivors make their escape.Apart from the fact they had enough firepower to wreak havok on the few remaining freaks anyway and a newly-rescued doctor with a kit bag that could have assisted our dying hero, the ending resulted in the damsel in distress being rescued and reunited with her beau and the idiot back-up-deputy seemingly saving the day.

430,andycotterill-00783,Absolute modern day masterpiece that somehow slipped below the radar.,9,9 April 2019,"This is the first review I've done in over 10 years but felt it needed to be done.After watching this film one of the main things that struck me was how the hell did this slip under the radar. Then I soon realized how. The film industry and cinemas were clogged up with utter garbage CGI superhero movies that cater for the masses. Sure there is a place for this junk food for the brain but it creates a vacuum behind and some classics fall into this and disappear into the abyss.I wont spoil the film but what we get here is a cast of well known actor's without the need to show off six packs and muscle ripped unrealistic bodies. This is pure acting in all its glory and how filmmakers should take note.The story starts with a brief introduction of what is to come. It plants a seed in the audiences mind but doesn't give too much away keeping you intrigued. Then we have a atmospheric dusty frontier town with a local sheriff and its few townsfolk. Following an incident that leads to an abduction we have our 4 characters quickly scrambling to mount a search and rescue operation.This is where the film comes into it's own. The filming and scenery is just fantastic and creates that ""out there"" exposed feeling. The film then starts to show the different qualities of each character. This is where you start to bond with each character and each one possesses his own quality that adds to the overall mission....no superpowers in sight just pure bare bones and great acting.The mission ticks along at the right pace sucking the viewer deeper into it.y You start to think what would you do... and before you know it you are almost In the wilderness with them.The tension builds throughout and following several occurrences our gang are cut adrift and past the point of no return. Then the film takes an unexpected turn and will catch audiences off guard. Imagine ""dusk till dawn"" but without the unrealistic aspect of vampires and CGI crap. We have a horrifying reality that requires a strong stomach but will keep you gripped until the last minute.That's where I'll leave it.....I gave it 9 out of 10 because to go against the grain of modern day garbage and take it back to good old good acting and filming locations this brings the art of filmmaking back to basics and delivers with such a punch that will shock.Go see it is all I can say.",Bone Tomahawk

441,daveschmid,A Creepy Fun Take On a Western,7,2 October 2021,"I liked this. It wasn't a scary movie, and I in no way feel disturbed or unsettled by it. It was almost campy in some ways, but overall Bone Tomahawk was a fun, enjoyable movie with some gruesome twists and really solid acting from the entire cast. Gore was used sparingly, though to great effect in a couple of scenes. The characters were all distinct and well fleshed out; you genuinely cared for each of them abd rooted for them throughout the story's arc. There's something about this movie that could have been so much darker and more sadistic, but I think that would have ruined it. By employing a campy, spaghetti western style with frequent enough doses of dry humor (the assistant deputy was great to this effect), it kept the movie from taking on a negative, depressing atmosphere devoid of amusement despite still managing to maintain a sense of foreboding, impending doom as the characters edged closer and closer into hostile territory. The movie's sounds were tuned quite effectively-the squelching squish of open wounds, sinister blare of bloodthirsty horns and screeching battle cries of the ""troglodytes"" left an eerie and memorable impression. While I have to question those who deem this movie terrifying and truly scary-as I didn't feel real fright or horror even during the movie's most challenging, viscerally shocking scenes-I have no trouble agreeing with those who simply enjoyed this movie for the bizarre, genre bending adventure that it is. Final rating, a solid 7/10.",Bone Tomahawk

This blu ray went straight into the garbage can. I do not want to inflict the boredom and complete waste of time I experienced on anybody else.The plot is so thin you can see through it, the characters are uninteresting, the direction feels fake and uninspired, the boring color grading is ugly and entirely destroys what little good the cinematography could have done to this movie, and I could go on.

There was killing but its pretty traditional focus the camera away to suggest there was something violent going on. There was no other type of violence like that in this movie and they go right to this one unrelated and unmatched scene. Then they drag the movie on for another 15 minutes with a pretty crappy ending. I never write reviews and signed up just to show my shocking disapproval for this. Its really a waste of time. Just don't see what they were trying to accomplish. If you want to be gory and horrific, you should do it throughout the movie.

Actors Patrick Wilson, Matthew Fox (where has he been?), and Richard Jenkins are an outstanding secondary cast to Kurt and we also appreciated Lilli Simmons (who I had never seen before) as the doctor who gets captured and sparks the posse to set out and rescue her. I loved her character's storyline and attitude, not your usual western where the woman just lets herself be taken care of or controlled. I'll have to check out BANSHEE on Amazon to catch more of her acting. We really liked the movie even though it started out a little slow, when they got on the trail it finally picked up. The brutal encounters with the cannibalistic Indians were crazy, very scary, and made for a thrilling finale.

I expected a gritty, atmospheric, dark Western like ""True Grit"". The movie had a promising start and also the cast seemed promising. The last third of this flick is so ridiculous, though, that it reminded me more of a B horror movie than a Western.The ""cave dwellers"" are depicted so unrealistically and over the top that I was sorry I had to sit through 1,5 hours to arrive at this ridiculous scenario.If you'd like to watch a Western with a great, dark, gritty atmosphere with bad-ass characters, suspense and a rewarding ending, avoid this movie and re-watch ""True Grit"" (the new version).",Bone Tomahawk

The scenery and the set are quite OK for a western. You don't have to much human interaction. There are also some plot holes.

Kurt Russell was at his best, Patrick Wilson made the broken leg seam real, not just acting, we felt his pain. Matthew Fox did well but not at his best, and Richard Jenkins was really good.

Its characters elicit the responses required to root for them , be reviled by them and care for them.

456,hairball-1,What WAS that???,2,16 April 2018,"Picked this movie out of a bargain bin, attracted by the fact that it had some good people in it. LOVED Kurt Russell in ""Tombstone"" and being led to think that this was (supposedly) another Western, we were looking forward to it. I mean, they don't make too many Westerns anymore.And they didn't make one this time, either.In fact, we sat through it and by the end, really had no idea exactly WHAT it was that we'd just sat through. Or in my case, WHY I'd sat through it.Kurt Russell will always be Kurt Russell and I think he'll always be good in any character portrayal, as he was here in the role of the Sheriff. In my mind, he will always BE Wyatt Earp, in one of my favorite Westerns. But this movie kind of morphed from Western to Science Fiction to outright blood-and-guts gruesome and hideous Horror. Took some seriously sick minds to come up with some of the gore portrayed in this movie and I actually had to look away several times, although the sound was still horrible!There were a lot of impossibilities in this movie. I did like Matthew Fox's portrayal of an eccentric and rather creepy character, but I'd like to know, first off, what he was thinking by going through his days in a dirty, dusty frontier town dressed in a dapper white suit, and secondly, how he managed to stay so clean ... until he was attacked by those ""creatures,"" that is. Then, a guy wracked with fever because of a gangrenous leg simply could not drag himself through a desert all alone (especially with cannibals lurking about which brings me to wonder why in the world they didn't nab him?? An easy meal if there ever was one! I mean, being crippled and all ...). Then, the lack of outright blubbering hysteria on the part of the captured wife when the Sheriff and ""Chicory"" (loved that name!) were dragged into the cave had me totally baffled! Why she wasn't huddled in the back corner in a tight, quivering ball of terror, scared completely out of her mind, just escaped me! Instead, when she saw them, she seemed very calm and almost bored as she immediately greeted the Sheriff. Amazing! A braver, stronger and more even-keeled little gal than me, that's for sure! And again, she was still so clean!My husband didn't say much but I found the one critique he did have hilarious: ""You know, hacking a guy in half just wouldn't happen that 'cleanly.' There'd be all kinds of internal stuff to deal with and he wouldn't just pull apart like that.."" No. He probably wouldn't.And I still can't figure out what the crippled pregnant women really had to do with anything.We both agreed that the movie was ""really awful"" and we felt let down because that group of actors deserved a better movie. There are lots of people who like lots of gore and if that's the case, they're gonna LOVE this movie. But for those of us who still appreciate actual Westerns and have seen these actors in much better roles, we both found ourselves actually wishing we hadn't watched it. It was horrible and haunting and nothing like we were hoping it would be.",Bone Tomahawk

The whole time I was waiting for something to happen but then....wait for it...nothing. I wished I had gone for my root canal instead. It would have at minimum made better use of my time. Any guy that can drag himself thru the desert with a broken leg deserves an academy award, if only this whole scene was half-way believable. It's not. Neither was baffing his wife missionary style like really bro? Aren't you putting some weight on that thing? The ridiculous sounds the troglodytes make is annoying and by the time they sliced the guy in half which was gross, I kept wondering how the heck the dude with the busted leg was going to save his kidnapped wife when everyone else was dead or captured.

The cave looks as if it were made of blankets covered in clay and how the hell did the cave cells hold them in with wooden bars somehow secured by wooden pegs pushed in by hand? The nasty Troglatites didn't look very Troglatitish and the damsel in distress still looked fresh as a daisy, I thought it very gentlemanly that the Trogs didn't even grab her by the pussy. Yet despite Kurt getting shot in the stomach he still had the strength to cut off one of the trogs heads with what seems a Jawbone. Couldn't wait to the finish!I think Hollywood is running out of ideas what with this and 'Cowboys and Alien's' at least it had good effects, unlike this one.

Acting was understated but matched the mood of the movie perfectly. Kurt Russell is back in a huge way. All the cast were perfect for their roles. The violence was gruesome but rarely over the top. The troglodytes were menacing. The story and writing however is what carries the movie. Its basic ""Searchers"" material with a modern twist. I would in no way consider this a horror movie. Its a western but with very dark overtones. Cinematography is good and again matches the tone of the movie. The only reason this receives an 8 and not higher is I feel that at 132 minutes it runs a little long and that 10 minutes of the search could have been edited.",Bone Tomahawk

Except for the occasional funny lines by the assistant deputy, the acting, including that of Kurt Russell, was terrible. The story was terrible. All day I have been thinking that these reviews are a prank or we watched different movies. I suppose to be fair, the cinematography was good.

The film successfully joins the western and the horror genres into one. Kurt Russell provides a masterful portrayal of Sheriff Hunt, an in-charge Sheriff looking to rescue his deputy and other residents of the town. While Russell provides the audience with a great portrayal of Sheriff Hunt, Richard Jenkins portrayal of Chicory, was my favorite character. Chicory is a good natured backup Deputy that provides some of the best delivered lines.

466,tntbw,About two hours too long...,1,25 October 2015,"This is my first review on IMDb, I just had to register to warn people away from this movie. Don't be fooled by the list of great actors who seemingly signed on for this disaster just for the paycheck. Don't get me wrong, they tried their best with what they had to work with, which wasn't much. Clearly most of this movie's budget went to pay for the cast, probably 10% went towards the set pieces, 0% towards the musical score, as there isn't any, and whatever was left over was used to pay off some movie critics over at RT. This turd got 86% at RT, they should be ashamed for telling such a lie. With the exception of when the heroes are riding and then walking across the desert to rescue some kidnapped town folk, the entire movie is shot in small, indoor dwellings that look like the sets from either the old Star Trek or Batman TV shows. Honestly, this is the first western I have ever watched where you don't get to see the town, I guess that wasn't in the budget, nor were the extras it would take to make it look lived in.",Bone Tomahawk
467,amrod-40740,Will linger in your mind long after you have seen this movie.,8,26 October 2015,"I have never posted a movie review online. At 49 years old, that should really tell you something about Bone Tomahawk. I saw the movie about 4 days ago and I am still thinking about it. Having read multiple other reviews about this movie both professional and viewer, I am not sure any one in particular has really nailed what it is about this movie that makes it so fascinating. There have been lots of reviews claiming it is a Western Horror movie, something like The Searchers meets the Hills Have Eyes. But I really think that does it an injustice. This was a straight up Western in my opinion. Yes, there are some extremely violent scenes, but that in and of itself does not make it horror.Bone Tomahawk is very simple in its story. Four rugged men, all substantially different characteristically, travel cross the western terrain to save a deputy and a wife/doctor who have been kidnapped by a barbaristic cannibal tribe. Their journey makes up three quarters of this movie. The dialogue between the men is exceptionally well written in that it almost seems to be too proper for its time, but it has the effect of drawing you in. With the subtle lack of background music or noise and rather drab cinematography, the viewer is somewhat forced to listen to the conversations between these men. As a result, it all feels very natural and was easy and interesting to watch.The last quarter of this movie is odd. Yes, it is brutally violent and the scene everyone has been talking about is almost unbearable to watch. Another reviewer commented that the image of that scene is burned in his brain and it is impossible to un-see it although like him, I have tried. When the cannibals first attack our travelers, it almost seems slapstick, with an odd looking arrow that knicks Richard Jenkins in the head and other cannibals jumping out from the bushes only to be shot in very clumsy ways. What makes the violence so unnerving is the reaction of our characters to it. When the young deputy in the cave is meeting his demise, he is carrying on a conversation with Kurt Russell. No one is screaming in fear and when the kill takes place, the natural instinct of the viewer (me) was OMFG!!!! But Kurt Russell and the other characters did not appear uncomfortable or surprised at all. With the lack of background music, the kill becomes all the more realistic. Later on, Patrick Wilson is graphically digging something out of one of the cannibals throats. We are not just given a brief glimpse of this, but a prolonged shot with no background noise other than the sound of fingers penetrating flesh and blood. Again, it is difficult to watch. But Patrick Wilson's character does not seem disgusted by it at all. It is just something he needs to do.Bone Tomahawk is in reality a pure Western. The violence is always there in Westerns, just not as graphic. Scalping has been talked about in many a western before this, just not shown as graphically as it is here. After reflecting on the movie, I am certain that the laid back nature of the dialogue and lack of emotional outbursts by any of the characters, made the movie that much more impactful. Lots of movies can make you cry or laugh or scream. Bone Tomahawk will do much more; it will make you remember.",Bone Tomahawk

When you think about it they have a 2hr period in which they  have to bring you into there world and make you feel the way they do.  This movie does that better than most high budget movies. By taking out  the music you hear things that you normally wouldn't so you become  focused on every sound (foot steps, cutting with a knife.

477,crazytefl,"Good effort on the part of the actors, weak idea",2,31 January 2016,"Spoilers ahead.I am not sure why this movie was made. I could see the actors making a lot of effort to save it, but in places it was just too cheesy. By the end of the film, some of the cast started overacting, while others did the opposite. The characters are quite ""cartoonish"".The funniest moment is when Kurt Russel's character, with a flask sticking out of his rib, convinces everyone he can't come with them and is staying behind. The expression on the girl's face is priceless: ""Oh, you are staying behind? With a bunch of excited cannibals? OK! Have fun! Thanks very much for doing it, mate!""The whole part where Kurt Russell, his deputy and the girl sit behind the wood bars, which they could have broken, waiting to be chopped in half and eaten is a failed rip-off of some other movies and books. The juxtaposition of the imminent and horrible death and the calm trivial conversations among the doomed characters did not work and did not have the desired effect. The whole part felt unnatural as if the director wasn't really sure where he was going with this. It felt more like a scene from a Charlie Chaplin's movie.The girl's husband crawling across the desert on his four and battling healthy ferocious cannibals is quite comical and unnatural too. The rest of the movie gives off the scent of some mild racist propaganda mixed with some slasher horror movie element to spice things up.I could not help but notice a cheeky smile on the girl's face as they were passing a bunch of grotesquely mutilated (synchronously pregnant) cannibal wives. This girl is the most fake character of them all.I would not call watching this movie a complete waste of time. It has its value as a bad example of cinematography. It also shows how good Kurt Russel really is - despite an absolutely dumb premise and horrible directing, he obviously did his best.",Bone Tomahawk
478,cruzacat,Terrible,1,20 February 2016,I've never written a review before but I could not resist the temptation to do so after watching this movie. 20 minutes in and I was already contemplating turning off the TV. This movie is incredibly slow. There is nothing exciting happening throughout the movie and the lack of music makes it awfully dull. The storyline is dreadful and incredibly unrealistic. I mean come on! 3 guys turn up and can barely shoot the cave dwellers... Then 1 man who is CRIPPLED dominants the rest and saves the day. What a load of garbage. People who have rated this highly need to watch a real movie. I regret spending $6 to rent this. Waste of money.,Bone Tomahawk
479,sportsther,"What was that? Not a western, a drama, a comedy or even real SciFi!",3,21 March 2016,"As a western, Bone Tomahawk couldn't decide whether it was a drama or comedy but eventually got around to what it wanted to be, a cheesy horror movie. I tried to get past the lack or development and the implausibility of the story line. Even after the movie was over, it left me scratching my head. Dialogue was extremely slow, the characters were flat, foley over-rode everything and at points the pounding horse hooves drowned out the background music. I know it wasn't meant to be an ""authentic"" western, but if I wanted a great fantasy western, I'd put in ""Cowboys & Aliens"". At least that one knows what it wants to be! For those that want an off-beat western done well, check out Jarmusch's Dead Man. Depp, Farmer, Thorton and Iggy Pop performances shine. There's a well written plot, smart dialog and plenty of character development, all things lacking in Bone Tomahawk. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112817/?ref_=nv_sr_2",Bone Tomahawk

Should have looked at reviews first before letting the family watch it, ended up turning it off and not finishing it. First of all the period correct attire was all wrong, The story-line was loosely put together and went on and on. The acting in this movie was mediocre no real talent. This showed up in the western category which was very misleading. If you expect this to be a typical western style movie it's not. I'm not going into the gruesome details of this crappy movie.

To my surprise, all the top comments give it a very high rating and a lot of praises. Did I watch the same movie as everyone else? Because wow. What a waste of time. The pace is slow, the characters barely fleshed out (pardon the pun), and much of the action and so called ""horror"" is frankly laugh worthy.

I didn't find Bone Tomahawk that good, and thought most of the gore was unnecessary, just kind of thrown in for shock value. The Troglodytes were a pretty unreal mix of Sci-Fi meets Freddy Kruger. Plus the story was just convoluted. (Who steals a woman, then carries her that far away to put her in a wooden cage?) It just didn't work for me. A big disappointment for any real western fans.

This is the best film I've seen in a decade. The script and dialogue are first- class. The performances are deft, supremely focused and perfectly pitched. The music is evocative and suspenseful and, at times, very beautiful. The Western movie is a long-established and occasionally hackneyed genre but this film has an entirely plausible feel while also having a quotidian strangeness to it. That it was produced on such a small budget is further proof that this is not only a masterpiece, but a major cinematic achievement.",Bone Tomahawk
489,lparle,A big let down **Spoilers**,3,24 July 2017,"I only watched this film because of the 7.1 scoring on IMDb. This film was such a let down. Great cast with a interesting plot and some good acting, but what a terrible ending. The first 3/4's which was predominantly a western was alright, however the last quarter which was more of a horror film was pretty awful. A couple scenes I couldn't get my head around; Brooder's death was expected at some point, but for such a good gun sling, why did he die so quickly and not really contribute in many killings?! Also in the cave the bore tusk wearing savage roared/screamed but it was unnaturally loud (even with it's throat piece) and made it appear more like an alien. The final scene of the survivors just walking down a mountain was just strange, I was left feeling like I'd missed part of the film with it's sudden ending.",Bone Tomahawk
490,bigraiderhater,Just didn't work for me.,3,13 August 2017,"I'm not sure if what I'm about to write would be considered a spoiler or not, but consider this a warning.I'll keep this short and sweet, unlike this movie. If it wasn't for the character, Chicory, I'd have given this movie a 1. Chicory's innocent and unintentional humor was the only thing this movie had going for it, in my opinion.It moved so slowly that I almost lost patience and turned it off. I don't mean slow as in ""building suspense"" slow. I mean ""watching Arthur drag his leg, fall down and moan in agony for half of the movie"" slow. We get it. He's miserable and bravely struggling to complete this monumental task. I didn't need to be beat in the head with that fact for an hour.Then, the last 30 minutes. Ugh. The bad guys were a cross between sci-fi and horror movie villains......but so cheesy. The scenes in the cave reminded me of an episode of the 1970's series, ""Land Of The Lost"". Yes. That cheesy. The bad guys use their hands to pound the cell bars into the wall. The good guys can't kick them out. But when the stuff hits the fan, the woman just pulls the bars off like nothing. I usually try not to nit-pick details like that, but this was just so fallacious.The bottom line is that I had high hopes for this movie, but the mixing of the genres didn't work for me. It felt like a very slow, ""B"" movie from the 80s.",Bone Tomahawk
491,robertcampion-78050,"Brilliant trailer, disappointing movie.",3,22 October 2017,"This could have been a great movie and I sadly suspect there was a great movie left on the cutting room floor. I felt opportunities were missed all over the place. The characters Chicory(Richard Jenkins), Purvis (David Arquette) and Brooder (Mathhew fox) were criminally under utilized and may have been effectively edited out of the movie, even the Sheriff(Kurt Russell) was marginalized as the film progressed. Arthur (Patrick Wilson) was good here but should not have become the central character and got far too much screen time.Samantha (Lili Simmons) was a 'Quinn Medicine Woman' type character in a time when there simply were no Quinn Medicine woman type characters and her face and perfect teeth just didn't fit this movie.The troglodytes were one dimensional and I suspect there was a missing rape scene (probably edited out) that would have given us more sympathy for the kidnapped and would have explained why Samantha was still being kept alive too.The costumes and sets were excellent, but the troglodytes cave was laughably cheap. Other reviewers have highlighted the dialogue ....All I am going to say is that the writers/producers of this movie clearly love Quentin Tarantino. There are strong hints of 'Dusk Til Dawn' and 'the Hateful 8' about this movie....thats not necessarily a bad thing, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and all that, but the problem here is its not soo much a homage but more like good old fashion plagiarism.The language is completely incongruous with late 1800's where even lowly cowpokes know what a troglodyte is ...seriously, I had to look it up !!!!Trailer was one of the best I have ever seen, but film itself was poorly edited and ultimately unsatisfying.",Bone Tomahawk

I really liked the first 1/2 of this movie though I felt the writing of the dialog was way overly Pollyanna -but very interesting. I think the plot is very interesting and ""new."" Then it takes a very serious and hardcore shockporn turn. Seven was pretty hardcore back in the day, but it left almost all of it to the audience's imagination. This left nothing to the imagination, even leaving you to wonder about how the special effects were done. I skipped past and landed on another scene that was only slightly less gruesome. I quit after that. It surpassed Seven and many SAW movies in my opinion. Unrelatable violence is such a fun cinematic experience. Yay.",Bone Tomahawk
494,camlawshee,"Competent, focused, and satisfying.",7,23 August 2019,"Bone Tomahawk is a movie that is done well but dissapoints in some areas.
I'll start with the good parts. The acting is top of the line, with every character feeling natural and realistic. There isn't any theatrical dialogue. Most of the talking is southernly and calm, what a dinky Western town like Bright Hope would have. The lighting is realistic, which is a massive plus. On top of that the way the film is shot compliments each scene, making each character pop when they speak.
Now I'll complain. The sound design is perfect up until people start to get mangled. The way the brutal kills sound really throws me for a loop because of how excessive and needless it feels. I hoped the sound would be muffled for the most part but slicing and dicing sounds crystal clear. The story also makes little logical sense. Arthur is a worthless character to bring along other than for plot convenience. A lot is left to be desired near the end, which also feels super rushed. A few extra shots would have helped fatten up sections that were other wise bare bones. The beginning isnt perfect either, especially with the realistic aura of the film. How is someone to believe that after eleven days the main catalyst of the film didn't just die in the desert? If he knew Bright Hope was where it was, how come the sheriff and deputy sheriff treat him like a complete stranger, even though they seem to know a lot about their town? Why did they only take 4 people instead of most of the townsmen, especially after the professor told them what they were up against? How have the troglodytes survived so long? How does the professor even know they exist, considering their aggressiveness and that most people who encounter them die? Most of these are nitpicks that could be resolved after a rewatch, but stand out as post-watching questions that require answers. The reason this film is getting a 7 instead of a 6 or 5 is because I believe the combination of the horror and Western elements of the film play perfectly off of each other, making horrendous scenes of violence explode unto the faces of viewers.",Bone Tomahawk

I didn't even realize this was a horror. I thought it was going to be another great Kurt Russell western like Tombstone.This movie was just too slow. So much so I fell asleep through about 20 minutes of it. The characters were interesting and the acting was good... it just took forever to build up the story.Then there's that third act. Sometimes filmmakers just go too far. The kill scene in this movie makes watching two big dinosaurs rip a man in half seem merciful. I get it... they want to shock the viewers. But for me, this was just unnecessarily brutal and graphic. If you think you've seen it all and have been desensitized thanks to movies like Hostel or Saw, you would be very mistaken. You. Haven't. Seen. Anything. Yet!The Motion Picture Association needs another rating beyond R for movies like this.",Bone Tomahawk
