0,Leofwine_draca,"Not the greatest, but I enjoyed it nonetheless",6,27 April 2016,"My love of the disaster genre means that I can enjoy this type of movie despite the myriad problems with it, alongside the inherent cheesiness and the poor writing which makes it laughable in places. It pales in comparison to stuff from the 1970s like THE TOWERING INFERNO and EARTHQUAKE, but it's certainly better than modern SyFy Channel and Asylum offerings, even if that's just because of the massive budget alone.The story is written so that the disaster scenes keep occurring throughout the movie. The CGI effects work is extensive, but it's also pretty good, and certainly better than in the awful 2012. Yes, you get all the flag-waving nonsense associated with this type of film, but you also get plenty of suspense scenes and depictions of post-earthquake devastation that you don't usually get to see in the movies.Dwayne Johnson continues to be a hulking, mildly charismatic presence in the movies, although he's no Schwarzenegger. Alexandra Daddario is there for her looks and certainly succeeds in that respect. The rest of the cast don't fare so well, with Ioan Gruffudd virtually reprising his role from SANCTUM and Paul Giamatti on autopilot, although at least we get to find out what happened to Art Parkinson (the disappearing Rickon Stark from TV's GAME OF THRONES). SAN ANDREAS is certainly undemanding entertainment, and not a film I'm in any hurry to sit through again, but compared to other offerings in this packed sub-genre, it's not THAT bad.",San Andreas
1,SnoopyStyle,lots of destruction,5,23 March 2016,"Raymond Gaines (Dwayne Johnson) is an LAFD rescue helicopter pilot. He is getting divorced to his wife Emma (Carla Gugino) after the death of their daughter Mallory. They still have their daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario). Emma is moving in with her rich boyfriend Daniel Riddick (Ioan Gruffudd). Daniel is flying with Blake on a private plane to San Francisco as he opens his new highrise. Meanwhile, Caltech professor Dr. Lawrence Hayes (Paul Giamatti) is researching an earthquake predictor with reporter Serena Johnson (Archie Panjabi) doing a story on him. When the earthquake strikes, Blake is trapped as Daniel abandons her. Brothers Ben and Ollie Taylor come to the rescue.It's funny that I saw Charlton Heston's Earthquake (1974) just before watching this movie. CGI has created much better destruction. Neither has a terribly good story. It's weird that the seismic teams from both movies go to a dam. The Rock is great as always. His opening rescue is fun and exciting. It does bother me that he's a rescue pilot but he doesn't rescue a soul flying all over California. I love the destruction and the action but lots of bothersome things start piling up.It's weird that Raymond would tell Emma to bring as many people as possible to go up to the roof. He's only one helicopter and I doubt he could take more than ten people. They would be in terrible trouble if she's actually successful. Next, it bothered me that Ben brought Ollie down to the basement garage. I get the risk reward equation of rescuing the hot girl but he can't bring his little brother into that. Finally, Raymond and Emma is racing through the flooded streets like the Grand Prix. I cringed at thought of all those people they're running over as they speed through. You can forget about them stopping to help anybody else. That's the last straw for me. I can live with all the death and destruction but the heroes can't be running over everybody with their boat. There are a few overwrought scenes and I would like a connection between Dr. Hayes and the Gaines.",San Andreas
2,Prismark10,Cracks in the earth,5,17 March 2016,"San Andreas is a big dumb disaster action film but it is entertaining enough with some good special effects.The Rock plays a rescue pilot and a brave one as we see in the beginning. However he is soon to be divorced, as his ex has found a millionaire property magnate, he also cannot get over the death of his other child.When the big quake strikes, The Rock springs into action, despite all the chaos he rescues his wife from the top of a collapsing building and then goes looking for his daughter, abandoned by her mother's boyfriend and aided by two random British kids she just met.Never mind other people who are injured or needs rescuing, the Rock only has his family in mind and he will commandeer any vehicle he can get his hands on. The rest of the cast are underwritten such as Paul Giamatti's seismologist doing his best to warn others.A popcorn film that you will see once and that is it. However how many times will we see The Golden Gate Bridge being destroyed though?",San Andreas
3,mark.waltz,"Disasters happen, but are they always this same formula?",3,9 May 2016,"Remember Clark Gable searching for Jeanette Macdonald in 1906? Lana Turner struggling to avoid falling trees in exotic settings in two different movies? Charleston Heston and Ava Gardner struggling to find a way out of collapsed skyscrapers? Even Superman reversing a quake. Now those had moments of tension that were gripping and nail biting, but it was all about survival and helping others cope and nothing more. Along came the modern disaster movie which took basically the same synopsis and plugged in different names, different types of natural cataclysmic horrors and shoving it all around an estranged or separated family determined to get back together no matter what the cause.This surrounds the heroic Dwayne Johnson, aka ""The Rock"", having him and his ex-wife in a helicopter flying from L.A. to S.F. to rescue their daughter after his ex-wife Carla Gugino's boyfriend abandoned her, leaving her with a foppish British lad and his pesky younger brother. This was acceptable in ""Dante's Peak"", silly but tolerable in ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and eye- rolling and outlandish in ""2012"". If you thought that the exploding freeways and the collapsing buildings threatening the family driving and later flying through it, wait until you see ex-wife jumping up on collapsing debris to get to the Rock's helicopter.I had a feeling of the mentality of this movie with the opening of a twit- wit girl, not paying attention while driving through the San Gabriel mountains, looking back to grab a bottle of water and her phone (of course) and going over a cliff hundreds of feet because of rocks falling from a smaller quake, and surviving barely getting dirt on her face. How could the creators of this not realize what a disaster they had on their hands, maybe not in box office dollars (you could sell the Hoover dam to these types of movie audiences) but in critical pans. Blame ""Titanic"" for starting this wave of formula films that in retrospective just didn't know where to stop. Certainly watchable, this is beyond flawed and outlandish in so many ways. Computer generated effects and ear blasting dramatic music just intensify how over the top. As tragic as the real thing would be, there is no way that these characters would survive any of these intense situations. It's all too much, too repetitive, too dark and after a while, it is obvious what is going to happen. I can only watch so many of these movies, not just because of their absurdities, but because of the grim future they predict, and, I'm sorry. That ain't entertainment.",San Andreas
4,claudio_carvalho,"Lame Story, Great Special Effects",6,3 January 2016,"In Los Angeles, the Fire Department Air Rescue pilot Raymond ""Ray"" Gaines (Dwayne Johnson) will drive his daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) to San Francisco since she has joined the university. He is divorcing from his wife Emma (Carla Gugino) that intends to move in together with her wealthy boyfriend Daniel Riddick (Ioan Gruffudd). Meanwhile the researchers Dr. Lawrence Hayes (Paul Giamatti) and Dr. Kim Park (Will Yun Lee) from the Caltech travel to a dam to check their seismic studies and there is a strong earthquake collapsing the dam that kills Kim. Lawrence discovers that the San Andreas Fault is moving and will cause a huge earthquake in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Ray needs to travel to help the victims from the dam and Daniel offers to take Blake to San Francisco since he has a meeting in the city. Daniel brings Blake to his office and while waiting for him, she befriends the British architect Ben Taylor (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) and his younger brother Ollie Taylor (Art Parkinson). When Ray is flying to the dam, there is an earthquake in Los Angeles and he rescues Emma. When the earthquake reaches San Francisco, Daniel escapes with Blake to his limousine but the building collapses and she is trapped inside the car. Daniel flees from the building and leaves Blake behind. Blake succeeds in contacting her father but the cell phone dies. What will happen to her?""San Andreas"" is a popcorn disaster movie, a genre that was usual in the 70's, but with state-of-art special effects. Unfortunately, the lame and corny story is ridiculous. Ray uses the helicopter to rescue his wife and daughter and destroy it. He steals a pickup truck; an airplane from the hangar; and a boat to save his daughter apparently with no consequences. His ex-wife Emma resolves all her issues with Ray in the middle of the chaos. There is no cell phone, but the fixed-line telephone works perfectly despite the destruction and havoc. Blake, Ben and Ollie save the film. There is a tsunami and Ray drives the motor boat in the middle of the debris and possible survivors as if he were in a race. In the end, love is beautiful! My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Terremoto: A Falha de San Andreas""(""Earthquake: The San Andreas Fault"")",San Andreas
5,nogodnomasters,THIS IS NOT A NORMAL DAY,5,21 May 2018,"PLOT SPOILER REVIEW???Ray (Dwayne Johnson) is ex-military working for LA Fire and Rescue. In the opening scene, God rightly attempts to kill the world's most distracted driver, and Ray foils the plan with a helicopter that has its own swagger music. In a subplot that never connects, Paul Giamatti plays Professor Hayes at Cal Tech who predicts the big one, i.e what happens in Vegas, happens in LA.The basic plot is the same as an Asylum disaster movie plot. A great disaster happens, and the film concentrates on one typical 2.3 child family trying to come together. In this case substitute a new male friend and his brother for 1.3 kids. The main difference is that Ray is separated from his wife (Carla Gugino) who is going to live with her new boyfriend Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd) and his daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario). Yes I had ""Taken"" plot flashbacks and wondered if they were going to include Albanians. Liam Neeson would have stopped the looters.As far as the plot, I really don't have to say anything more. Unless you are younger than the film rating, you will have the whole thing figured out in the first 10 minutes. Even the action within the scenes are predictable, like the Hoover dam scene hand off.The soundtrack was typical. What separated this from an Asylum flick was the special effects, actors, and lack of insignia gaffs.If you want on overly predictable action/disaster film, this is it.Guide: 1-2 F-bombs. No sex or nudity.",San Andreas
6,kosmasp,Shaking,6,10 July 2015,"It has been quite some time, since we last had a movie like this. You can't really invent anything new with the formula. All you can throw at the viewer (no pun intended) are the best possible special effects. Clichés? Well you know you'll get them. You also get very beautiful people here in the main roles (if you're not offended by that, you'll go on a journey with them).The Rock saving people? That's not a stretch. His charisma shines through the screen and you believe he's able to do most of the things that are depicted in this. The story itself is not going to have you guessing too much, but it's sufficient enough to carry what's going on. It's decent and the movie entertaining enough",San Andreas
7,Sleepin_Dragon,If only Dwayne Johnson could save the world.,5,14 October 2015,"The San Andreas Fault is 100 years overdue to get angry, but all that changes as the biggest earthquake (of course it is!) rips up. Ray (Dwayne Johnson) is a rescue Pilot, with family issues, his wife Emma has left him for Daniel Riddick. Daniel is in San Francisco with Ray's daughter Blake, when the Earthquakes start cranking up.So the start sets the tone, a woman in a Jeep hurtles off several rock faces and is OK. I'm surprised she wasn't lifting out clutching a Prada handbag and a bichon frise. All sense of reality has now gone.The CGI, special effects are utterly breathtaking, a step up from Day after tomorrow, 2012 etc, they are literally jaw dropping. The Hoover Dam destruction is awesome, that cost a few $£'s to produce. The filming and camera-work throughout are brilliant.The acting for the most part is pretty good, with this time of action movie you're not going to get Shakespeare. Great to see the stunning Archie Panjabi appear (Journalist.) Alexandra Daddario is really good (it's those eyes.)Some elements that you'd expect, Ray being able to pinpoint Emma in San Francisco, very likely? The Blake story also makes The Day after tomorrow's family meet up seem realistic. Every cliché imaginable is on show, there are too many to even begin, once again partner's new love turns out to be no good (when are they ever?) Almost every scene is contrived, whatever they need appears, cars, planes, phones.If disaster strikes I want more then Dwayne Johnson, Kylie and a guy with his laptop telling me to drop, cover and hold on.In some ways it's shocking, but it's too much fun to hate, incredibly repetitive, but very watchable in spite of it's huge flaws. 6/10",San Andreas
8,Tweekums,"An exciting, over-the-top disaster movie",8,25 July 2019,"This big-budget disaster movie sees Dwayne Johnson playing Raymond Gaines, a rescue helicopter pilot with the Los Angeles Fire Department. His wife is filing for divorce and her wealthy new boyfriend, Daniel Riddick, is taking Raymond's daughter, Blake, to San Francisco because he has to fly to Nevada after an earthquake destroys the Hoover Dam. Seismologists soon realise that it is a precursor to a massive quake that devastates Los Angeles and causes major damage throughout California. Raymond manages to rescue his wife and the pair head north to save their daughter. She is now with a pair of British boys, Ben and Ollie, the older of whom was in the city to apply for a job at Daniel's firm. Then an even larger quake strikes San Francisco; Blake and the boys must head to safe higher ground and hope Raymond can get to them.If you are looking for realism you are in the wrong place but if you just want an exciting roller-coaster ride of a movie where the protagonists survive a succession of disasters by the narrowest of margins then this is the film for you. The opening scene features a daring rescue which serves to introduce Raymond. After a very brief lull to introduce his family the action proper gets started. This begins with the spectacular destruction of the Hoover Dam and then escalates as we see Los Angeles and later San Francisco decimated; buildings collapse and famous landmarks destroyed. Dwayne Johnson impresses as Raymond Raines and the rest of the cast are solid even if the characters are for the most part playing second fiddle to the special effects. These effects looked fantastic on my relatively small television; I imagine they would have looked amazing on the big screen. Overall I'd say that this is well worth watching if you want a thrilling ride.",San Andreas
9,ma-cortes,Breathtaking and spectacular disaster movie with big name cast and decent special effects,6,11 October 2019,"In the aftermath of a massive earthquake in California, a rescue-chopper pilot .

Meantime , the researchers Dr. Lawrence Hayes (Paul Giamatti) and Dr. Kim Park (Will Yun Lee) from the worldwide geophysical Caltech team are investigating strange events and learn that the earth's core is heating up, as they travel to a dam to control their seismic studies and there is a strong earthquake collapsing the dam. Later on , an earthquake causing death, destruction and wreak havoc. They fight for saving a fraction of the city's population, but the entire big town is doomed , as the citizens to escape the impending cataclysm. Along the way Raymong struggles to find a way to save his family. This impressive quake has an awesome and destructive power enhanced by the overwehelming special effects and digital sound. Ever have one of those days...? Pray you don't.Where will you be, who will you be with? San Andreas. We always knew this day would come. Then a series of global catastrophes threatens to annihilate mankind and unprecedented eruptions and earthquakes of unprecedented strength wreak havoc all around California. We Were Warned .Who will be left behind?The end is just the beginning. Geologists predicted it...Now, science has confirmed it...but we never imagined it could really happen. Mankind's earliest civilization warned us this day would come...Ordinary catastrophe movie in thrilling and vintage style with all star cast dealing with a huge earthquake outbursts at the noisy city of San Francisco .
Acceptable disaster movie paced in fits and starts with a great cast, though a little wasted . The plot summary centers in a valiant pilot who goes to look for his daughter and a sismologist who predicts disasters , fighting amount of dangers because of San Andreas Fail is cracking . The F.X. of computer generator are first rate , better than the classics 7o and 80 :""Earthquake"", ""Inferno towering"" and likeness to ""Volcano"" or ""Armaguedon"" and ¨2012¨. Thrilling screenplay dispenses absurd excitement as well as spectacular scenes and lots of action . This is a fast-paced, stylized disaster-spectacle film with noisy action , thrills , chills and strong images of destruction and chaos. In addition , cinematography and musical score are breathtaking . The impressive , state-of-art special effects and the good cast cannot save this passable film , at all . It lacks deep characterization , displaying some boring moments and a tiring script that was presumibly well paid . This was a successful catastrophe movie that belongs to disaster movie genre that in the 70s and 80s achieved splendor , such as : ¨Towering inferno¨ , ¨Poseidon¨, ¨Beyond Poseidon¨ , ¨The swarm¨, ¨Avalanche¨, ¨The Russian rollercoaster¨, ¨Avalanche express¨ , ¨Airport I, II, III..¨ and whose main representative was producer Irwin Allen . All of them packed primitive and traditional special effects , with no computer generator effects ; nowadays , these catastrophe movies are plenty of 3D FX , showing breathtakingly realist images . Main cast is pretty well, giving understanding interpretations , such as : Dwayne Johnson as pilot Raymond Gaines , wife Carla Gugino , their daughter Alexandra Daddario and Paul Giamatti . Support cast is frankly good such as Daniel Riddick , Ioan Gruffudd , Archie Panjabi , Hugo Johnstone , Art Parkinson , Will Yun Le and brief appearance by singer Kylie Minogue .It delivers a colorful and evocative ambient thanks to an expert cinematography cameraman by Steve Yedlin . As well as a frightening , suspenseful and moving musical score by Andrew Lockington . Being lavishly as well as efficiently produced , and competently directed by Brad Peyton . This non-sense but enjoyable disaster movie was decently directed by the Canadian writer/producer/filmmaker Brad Peyton , though with no originality and it has some flaws and gaps . Brad Peyton is a good writer , producer and filmmaker who has directed a few acceptable films , such as : ¨San Andres¨ , ¨Journey 2: The Mysterious Island¨, ¨Project Rampage¨ and ¨Incarnate¨ and he is shooting San Andreas II . Rating : 6/10 . Passable and decent catastrophe movie",San Andreas
10,BA_Harrison,Measures a 7.5 on the BA_Harrison disaster movie scale.,8,30 May 2015,"Awesome. Magnificent. Spectacular. Breath-taking. But that's enough about buxom beauty Alexandra Daddario in her tight vest what about the rest of the film?Well, San Andreas delivers precisely what one might expect from a big-budget disaster movie starring Dwayne' The Rock' Johnson: a scientist (Paul Giamatti) who tries to warn of the impending disaster; a strained relationship between hero Ray (Johnson) and his tasty wife Emma (Carla Gugino), which will, of course, be resolved before the end credits roll; the destruction of several famous landmarks; a resourceful, plucky daughter (Daddario) who has learnt all she knows from her resourceful, plucky father; numerous narrow escapes for all of the main characters, from falling buildings, explosions, crashing vehicles, and tidal waves; impressive CGI effects that pervade almost every single frame; and a nasty character who gets what he deserves (a container ship on his head!). In short, San Andreas delivers almost all of the expected clichés of the genre—all that's missing is a cute dog saved from the jaws of death in the nick of time.It's highly preposterous and predictable Hollywood nonsense the likes of which we have seen many times before, but it is sufficiently loud, chaotic, and expertly executed to be worth the price of a ticket for most disaster movie fans.My favourite moments (apart from Daddario sunbathing in her bikini and her underwater swim, that is): the ground breaking open and a tube train spilling out onto the streets of San Fransisco, and the big surprise waiting for Ray and Emma at the top of the tidal wave.7.5 out of 10, happily rounded up to 8 for—you guessed it—Alexandra Daddario.",San Andreas
11,paul_haakonsen,"There is Mother Nature, and then there is Raymond Gaines...",7,5 October 2016,"Right, well there is no doubt about it, that this 2015 disaster movie was going to be one of those by-the-book disaster movies that end up being so predictable that even a blind man knows what will happen way before it did on the screen. And sure enough, director Brad Peyton didn't fail to live up to that and deliver a very predictable movie.With that being said, I am not saying that ""San Andreas"" is a bad movie. Actually it was very, very enjoyable. It was so predictable that it was actually becoming fun to watch and bet on what would happen throughout the movie. But also the special effects. This certainly was a Hollywood CGI and special effects galore from start to end. And it was the special effects that kept the movie afloat, pardon the pun.The story is about a shift on the tectonic plates which cause several massive earthquakes to strike the coast of USA, causing unprecedented damage to cities and the country. And in the middle of all the chaos and destruction is Raymond Gaines (played by Dwayne Johnson) and Emma Gaines (played by Carla Gugino) in a desperate search for their daughter Blake Gaines (played by Alexandra Daddario).You know how this movie turns out even way before you actually press the play button on the remote. But still, just sit back and enjoy all the action and the special effects, because it really is breathtaking. If you enjoyed the ""2012"" movie - the one with John Cusack - then you will most definitely also enjoy ""San Andreas"".As I have mentioned already, then this is first and foremost a CGI and special effects movie, and a huge chunk of credit should really be given to the CGI and special effects team for what they pulled off here. It was an amazing ride to sit through this movie, because all the destruction and mayhem looked so realistic and so awesome. But one thing that puzzled me was the lack of human bodies. Wouldn't there be lots and lots of dead people around in the debris and floating around in the water? Oddly enough there was very, very little of that to be seen. It was a shame, because it would have been a nice and realistic detail to the movie.The acting in the movie was good, and I think that Dwayne Johnson did an okay job here, although it wasn't his best of performances. It was, however, Paul Giamatti (playing Dr. Lawrence Hayes) who put on the most memorable performance in the movie. And it was also a nice thing to watch Ioan Gruffudd (playing Daniel Riddick) in a role such as the one he had in this movie.""San Andreas"" is not a movie that challenges the intellect of the audience in any way, but it is a thrill ride that is more than worth to sit through. And while the movie is permeated by a sense of Dwayne Johnson's character being of almost super-human proportions and can handle everything that Mother Nature throws against him, it is still an enjoyable movie. Just don't think too much about what is going on around you on the screen, just sit back and enjoy the ride.",San Andreas
12,tavm,San Andreas was a very enjoyable disaster flick,8,3 June 2015,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. Seeing the images in 3-D, this was pretty exciting but if there weren't characters we cared about, I don't think this would have been as good. Dwayne Johnson is fine as the hero saving his family during an earthquake with ex-wife Carla Gugino-who previously appeared with him in Race to Witch Moountain and Faster-also playing a true heroine-helping when needed. Their daughter also proves her mettle when she gets involved with a couple of British brothers-one close to her age and his little brother-in helping them survive. Paul Giamatti is fine as the scientist who explains to his colleagues-therefore us-how serious things are as they happen. Oh, and I guess Ioan Gruffudd-who I always first think of as Reed Richards-Mr. Fantastic-in the Fantastic Four movie I saw a decade ago-is basically-well, not a villain but a jerk of a character who leaves his stepdaughter-or is she since I can't remember if he was even married to Ms. Gugino-when she was at her most danger! Didn't surprise me what happened to him! Anyway, me and my friend highly enjoyed San Andreas.",San Andreas
13,edwagreen,**1/2,6,13 March 2016,"This film defies the definition of disaster movies. Irwin Allen, move over.One thing that all disaster movies seem to have in common is that it always must bring in the inter personal relations of people or families. This film is no exception.Before the quakes hit, a woman is in the process of divorcing her husband and getting ready to move in with another. They lost one daughter in a rafting accident. The daughter accompanies the guy to San Francisco and when the quake hits, she is trapped in a car and he flees the scene. This was cowardice at its worst.Naturally, the woman and the soon to be ex-husband get together to rescue the daughter. They bond. Notice how in films that it always take a disaster to bring people together.Paul Giamatti is as much of a geologist as the man on the moon. Nice seeing Archie Panjabi, after her stint on ""The Good Wife,"" as Kalinda Sharma, in this film as a reporter.

The CGI disaster effects did get a lot of screen time, but I just couldn't feel any fear or urgency. Maybe the lion's share of the budget went to ""The Rock"" and FX.

15,hitchcockthelegend,Lots of rocks everywhere...,6,15 November 2015,"It's CGI destruction time as Dwayne Johnson battles earthquakes and a tsunami to go rescue his daughter - with estranged wife in tow of course.Disaster films are easy to kick because very rarely they are nothing more than candy carnage with a trite screenplay and cheese laden dialogue. Such is the case with San Andreas. In essence this is a remake of Roland Emmerich's 2012, only this is the shorter version with the time span that 2012 should have had. This does exactly what the marketing department promised it would, namely lots of crash bang and wallop, but just like Emmerich's behemoth it gets boring entering the final third, the writing just not good enough to hold interest once the noise and destruction dies down before the big finale arrives. Suspense is absent, emotional investment in characters is null and void, while there are no worthwhile surprises in store. But on the plus side Johnson is a likable guy and he carries us through till the end of what is a fun movie if expectation levels are appropriately set at dumb popcorn fodder. 6/10",San Andreas
16,Theo Robertson,Could Have Been A Bit More Nasty,6,6 June 2015,"One of the stand outs from the 1970s disaster movies was Mark Robson's 1974 film EARTHQUAKE . Where that film worked best is the character vignettes especially Marjoe Gortner's creepy and fascist National Guard soldier . There was also a streak of enjoyable meanness along with special effects that were achieved without the easy and lazy option of CGI and I came in SAN ANDREAS with EARTHQUAKE in the back of my mind !!!!! SPOILERS !!!!!! To be fair this is probably the wrong mindset which works against SA . The main bulk of the story revolves around Dwayne Johnson's para-rescue hero trying to save his wife and daughter during a mega-quake in California . The other characters are underwritten cyphers that are hard to care . That said Ray and his family are also difficult to care about but I'm guessing this isn't really a film people go to see due to the cast and want to spectacle ad here the film does succeed to an extent , though things do get overblown such as a cruise liner cashing in to buildings . You're also aware - though it isn't very noticeable here - that in this day and age if an effect is done it's nearly always done via CGI and green screen and technology over the years means cinema has lost a lot of its magicWhere SA really falls down is its lack of meaness . A few unnamed extras suffer death via spectacle in the initial quake and rather impressive is the chap running down a stairwell where the wall collapses and he falls out of the building . Tough luck dude but these are a bit few and far between for my liking and because the audience no emotional investment with these cyphers their deaths have little impact . The film's climax features Ray trying to save his daughter's life via CPR and thought for one moment we might actually have a rare Hollywood blockbuster with a downbeat ending . I was to be disappointed",San Andreas

He reunites with his super hot estranged wife Carla Gugino and they race to San Francisco to find their super hot daughter Alexandra Daddario as the largest earthquake ever hits California. Predictable to a (San Andreas) fault and rife with every cliché you can think of, this movie really shouldn't work. However, disaster movies have a long tradition of being entertaining as a whole despite the separate parts being terrible. What helps this one the most is an extremely likable cast that act like superheroes for nearly two hours. If you are in this movie and you have a remotely selfish thought, you won't make it out alive. This movie's big on karma. Which I guess it should be since it's a movie designed to appeal to the masses who don't want something thought-provoking, just some solid entertainment to take their mind off their crappy lives for awhile. On that front, the movie works very well. It's a nice diversion that gives you beautiful people, lots of action, and very good CGI. Popcorn movie fun and nothing wrong with that.

Plot is incredibly formulaic, you could substitute ""earthquake"" with any number of disasters - floods, fire, asteroid, sharknado (!), to name but a few - and have dozens of other movies, most of which would be better than this. The writers don't even bother trying to be original in the plot, or even have much of a plot. The main aim is for the director to show off his CGI skills, through collapsing buildings, large holes in the ground, tidal waves, scenes of destruction etc, all set against familiar backgrounds (eg San Francisco's CBD). Anything else is just a segue to the next CGI-generated catastrophe. As far as the casting goes, some interesting appearances, though this movie is not going to enhance anyone's CV. Not surprising to see The Rock in the lead role - this sort of schlock is what he does. Paul Giamatti must have really needed the money as this is far beneath his abilities. A bad sign for Ioan Gruffudd as he is capable of better roles (as the Hornblower series would attest to) - I guess this means his Hollywood career has stalled. Good to see Alexandra Daddario though, and not for her acting ability...Avoid - this is excruciatingly awful.",San Andreas

Thanks to SAN ANDREAS, we now know that Standard Operating Procedure for American First Responders in cataclysmic disasters is to Save Your Own Family Members First (no matter how many innocent bystanders you have to ignore, if not mow down hit-and-run fashion). I estimated that ""The Rock's"" indestructible over-sized zodiac boat chopped off the heads of 387 folks bobbing in the waters filling the streets of San Francisco. SAN ANDREAS also teaches us that life will go back to normal in a day or two, even if California's clout in Congress is reduced to the size of Montana's (as its need for crematoriums easily quadruples Hitler's during the entirety of WWII). The Science of SAN ANDREAS postulates that the Hoover Dam is built upon a so-far obscure branch of the SAN ANDREAS fault. Lastly, this flick reveals an urgent need to reinforce America's iconic H-O-L-L-Y-W-O-O-D sign, before it's too late!",San Andreas

While director Peyton has teamed up with Johnson before their shorthand may in fact deter the fact that the screenplay is leaden by Carlton Cuse and Andre Fabrizio & Jeremy Passmore that echoes the cheesy '70s genre films while evoking Roland Emmerich's wet dream of mass destruction techniques, laying to waste the Hollywood sign, The Golden Gate Bridge and Hoover Dam. Giamatti gets in touch with his inner Jeff Goldblum as the savvy seismologist who echoes the Greek chorus of ""Holy Mackeral! RUN!"" for the doomed populace.

This was terrible.I haven't seen a natural disaster movie since ""2012"". I could appreciate that movie even with some of its absurdities. This movie was one big cliché: from the ridiculous stunts, the uninjured stars save a scratch, the divorced co-stars, the d-bag new man and on and on.But this wasn't a movie about a natural disaster, the earthquake was secondary--a back drop.

Oh, and a super-mega-monster earthquake hits California, stranding Emma in mortal danger in Los Angeles and Blake in mortal danger in San Francisco, but fortunately Ray pilots a rescue helicopter...Disaster movies offer the spectacle of disaster married to the soap operatics of the characters caught up in those disasters, and San Andreas does not buck the trend here – the family members played by Dwayne Johnson (Ray), Carla Gugino (Emma) and Alexandra Daddario (Blake) are all likable – certainly likable enough for the audience to be invested in them and want to see them emerge alive and well at the end. And Ioan Gruffudd has just a sniff of the slimeball about him from the start...And we certainly get value for money in the disaster stakes – the destruction of the Hoover Dam (see Superman), Los Angeles decimated (see 2012), San Francisco pounded to pieces (too many to mention, most recently Godzilla) and flooded by a tsunami (OK, I'll grant you that one). Much of it makes little sense – San Francisco is, I recollect, a bit on the hilly side, and I have doubts that the floodwater would be quite as extensive as it is portrayed here – and there's not an ounce of originality in it from start to finish, but all of it is brilliantly executed.Alexandra Daddario is extremely gifted in the T-shirt-filling department.This film is the exact definition of a popcorn movie – sit down with your popcorn, put your brain on hold, and enjoy.",San Andreas
25,evanston_dad,"Planes, Trains, and Automobiles with The Rock",5,26 December 2015,"Poor California. No sooner does it recover from one cinematic disaster than it's struck by another, and I'll leave it to you to decide whether I'm talking about the movies themselves or the catastrophes that happen in them.L.A. is usually hardest hit, whether it be with earthquakes or towering infernos, but ""San Andreas"" is an equal opportunity devastator, so it goes after San Francisco as well. What happens is that the San Andreas fault splits wide open, as disaster mongers have warned with glee that it will eventually do someday, triggering a 10-magnitude earthquake, which, trust me and Paul Giamatti, the obligatory scientist who no one listens to until it's too late, is very bad. The movie can barely wait to set its devastation in motion and show off its bag of not-very-good special effects, so it eschews things like establishing characters or plot and gets right down to business knocking rows of skyscrapers over like dominoes. But fortunately for California, it has the Rock, or as he's known when he's trying to establish himself as a serious actor with a straight face, Dwayne Johnson. He's determined to save his wife and daughter, who are stranded somewhere amongst the mess. And if he can't do it, no one can, because he knows how to do literally everything. The film turns into a sort of ""Around the World in 80 Days"" on steroids, as Johnson uses one form of transportation after another to get to his loved ones - - helicopter, car, boat, plane (I think) -- and nearly every one of them crashes in a way that would kill any mere mortal manning them. I kept expecting him to show up in a hot air balloon next. I don't think it's spoiling anything to say that his mission is successful.Carla Gugino plays the wife, and the film makes some attempt to make her a useful human being rather than a mere damsel in distress (look, she knows how to drive a speed boat!) but only barely. And Giamatti tries his best to not look embarrassed as he says things like ""My God"" and knows he'll probably be paid $1 million to say them.You have to really be willing to tolerate a lot of dumbness to enjoy this movie, and even then it pushes the limits.Grade: C",San Andreas

A highly skilled helicopter pilot, Ray, races to save his ex-wife in Los Angeles, before the complete destruction of the city. After one daring rescue, Ray flies north toward San Francisco in search of his daughter, racing against time and the inevitable aftershocks that promise to devastate the coastline........Disaster movies always have more than one narrative in the film. They always have separate ones that make you get more involved with the characters, as to deter you from the huge plot holes, lacklustre script, and this films biggest crime, uninvolved side characters.Yes, we have at least seven characters in the film that are involving, but the plethora of other characters in the film are just there to help them on their way, like special keys in a video game to help you advance to the next level (the couple at the side of the road who just happen to own an air school), or to just scream, and then perish.You'll soon realise that it's not made to challenge your grey matter, as we have the Paul Giamatti section of the film giving us all the events of the filmHe is this films Jeff Goldblum in Independence Day, Ian Holm in The Day After Tomorrow, Don Cheadle in Volcano, a prolific actor in a high concept film giving us a commentary of what's happening in the film, and what is about to. And they always give us a big told you so near the end.So its a case of just sitting back, and seeing it on the biggest loudest screen there is, because it's all spectacle, and minimum plot development.The other two narratives involve Johnson and Gugino persevering to save there daughter and building bridges with each other, and eventually talking about a tragedy that caused them to separate.And the other narrative is for the teens in the audience, namely the females, as it involves the daughter, a very polite, very very English boy and his brother, vying to stay alive and eventually date, and these two narratives meld together by the end.Gruffud and Minogue appear briefly, and are the subliminal villains of the film, and really had no reason to be in the film at all.The effects as you'd expect, are wonderful, and at two hours, it goes at a steady pace.Without Johnson, this film would really struggle, he has this really wonderful screen presence that makes the most absurd concept seem palatable.So all in all, it's a nothing more than a big, dumb, event movie, and it was just as I expected, enjoyable, and instantly forgettable.Plus, I'm sure it holds a record for using the line 'get to the side of the stadium' so many times in two minutes.",San Andreas
27,phd_travel,Effects are good not over the top,8,26 July 2015,The main thing about a disaster movie is the disaster itself. And in this sense they got it mostly right. The effects beginning in the LA high rise collapse to the SF quake look real and not too over the top like in the Roland Emmerich movies. Dwayne Johnson and Carla Gugino are a watchable pair going to rescue their daughter. Alexandra Daddario seems to be able to play characters much younger than she is.There are a couple of illogical plot elements and faults. Firstly the disaster set in San Francisco didn't have enough familiar landmarks being destroyed. The streets they were floating around in were too wide - SF streets are very narrow in the downtown area. It's a bit absurd that Gruffud's evil developer character ran from downtown to the Golden Gate Bridge to avoid the water. It's too far and there are so many hills in the city that are closer. In fact people would have had plenty of hills to avoid the water in the city area. So the whole swimming around thing is unnecessary. Why not make the disaster fit into the real framework of San Francisco's layout? Overall it's quite an entertaining exciting disaster movie that doesn't have draggy moments and gives you what you came to see. Worth a watch.,San Andreas
28,trashgang,predictable storyline,7,30 September 2015,"Normally when 3D is available I go watching it in 3D but sadly I wasn't able to see it that way so I saw it in the normal version and I have mixed emotions at the end. For me the story wasn't that great after all and the effects didn't convince me all the way;The story is so weird. Ray (Dwayne Johnson) working for the fire brigade has for me forgotten what the fire brigade is all about, protect and serve. the only thing he does is protecting his family. You can see hundreds of people running and getting stuck in buildings but the only thing he wants to do is to protect and rescue his ex-wife and finding his daughter. Sadly you can see it coming miles away that the new lover of his ex is a going to have a hard time during the earthquake. The effects without people are superb but once the main lead is in the CGI you can easily spot they were in effects or green keys. But the earthquake at LA and San Fran are really breathtaking. Maybe they exaggerated with the boats running against the tsunami but that's so typical with this kind of family flicks. Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3,5/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",San Andreas

When you think that a couple million of people just died and there is absolute chaos everywhere he still finds his daughter in the middle of a devastated San Francisco. His rubber boat can apparently drive through debris without being damaged at all. No bodies to be found during the whole movie while the biggest earthquake ever just occurred.

30,siderite,A refreshing take on a tired genre this is not,5,27 August 2015,"This film is a classic disaster movie and by classic I mean exactly the same as any number of previous disaster movies. Even the awesome muscles of The Rock trying to escape his tight shirt and the equally awesome breasts of Alexandra Daddario trying to escape her tight shirt couldn't save the boring by-the- numbers script. The special effects were great, but I kind of saw everything (complete with subway train falling when the earth fractures) in 2012. Why are subways functioning during a 9.6 earthquake anyway?What is worse, the details that slip through the cracks of the carefully cloned plot are ridiculous. See professional rescuers coming to help a woman trapped in a car dangling dangerously over a chasm... and arriving in a helicopter. Then hovering above and wondering why the car shifts position and falls. Or watch Dwayne Johnson going to save his daughter by serially stealing every vehicle he can find, then trashing it. And when it's time to save his daughter he comes back to his wife to kiss her and reassure her that he will save the girl. I mean, all of the tension of almost losing her could have been avoided if he would have just gone and save her.Bottom line: just watch a clip of Alexandra running in her wet shirt over and over again and ignore the rest. Special mention for lovely up and coming Marissa Neitling. I have high hopes for her. Meanwhile Carla Gugino pops up in everything and gets more annoying by the day. And Dwayne Johnson... he was perfect for the role, but what a disastrous role it was. You can do better, man!Also worth mentioning: I think the PG-13 take and then the hopeful ""we all help each other with volunteers and FEMA and look at families holding each other"" ending was just an insult to New Orleans. Just saying.",San Andreas

32,StevePulaski,The summer of 2015 is officially here,7,31 May 2015,"Brad Peyton's ""San Andreas"" opens with a young girl driving on a winding road alongside a mountaintop. At one point, she looks down to get a drink of water as a sharp turn and another car approaches. Following that, she approaches another sharp turn and another oncoming vehicle and proceeds to read a text message. Both circumstances leave her unharmed. Suddenly, rocks begin to slide down the mountain, eventually knocking her down the mountainside, with her vehicle hitting every cliff on the way down before finally getting lodged vertically alongside the mountain. She winds up remaining unharmed in the vehicle as she waits for a helicopter rescue team led by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson to rescue her.Yes, dear reader, the weather is warming and incredulous disaster films are among us once again. If we're going to kick off the year with a breathless amount of gusto and action-packed scenarios, especially following the classy and wickedly entertaining ""Mad Max: Fury Road,"" we might as well follow that pleasant taste with another adequate entree. ""San Andreas"" is a film that sits so comfortably in its genre that its charm began to grow on me, and, despite a great deal of downright awful dialog and a contrived, emotional punch, there's still enough fun in this film to warrant a recommendation (firmly accompanied with a wink, as well).We focus on a variety of characters during the film, one of whom is Ray Gaines (Johnson), the aforementioned head of the Los Angeles Fire Department helicopter rescue squad. Ray is about to be divorced from his wife Emma (Carla Guino) and plans on taking their college-aged daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) on one last vacation. Meanwhile, Lawrence Hayes (Paul Giamatti) and Dr. Kim Park (Will Yun Lee), two Caltech seismologists, head to Las Vegas to track several small earthquakes when they witness the collapse of the Hoover Dam following an earthquake.As a result, Ray heads to the Hoover Dam, leaving his daughter with her stepfather (Ioan Gruffudd), but not before witnessing the San Andreas Fault shifting. This, again, causes a catastrophic 9.1 earthquake, with skyscrapers collapsing, overpasses crumbling before the eyes, and a fury of unpredictable hell. Ray winds up finding his wife in the chaos early on, but now has the responsibility of finding his daughter, who is with two tourists from England she met before the earthquake hit. In addition, Hayes must alert the people of California that the catastrophe isn't over and that a larger earthquake is on its way.The camaraderie in ""San Andreas"" is captured on a grandscale, and it's also shockingly brutal for a PG-13 film. Shots of buildings crushing people, people being engulfed by a tsunami, and every kind of disastrous circumstance find their way in ""San Andreas,"" with director Brad Peyton impressively handling all the action. The two biggest turn offs of disaster movies is when the action becomes so murky and indistinct that it's impossible to tell what is occurring and the frequently appalling lack of human interest plaguing these films. Peyton, surprisingly enough, handles the action element crisply, with editor Bob Ducsay (who has edited a variety of action films, all the way from the latest ""Godzilla"" to ""Tremors 2: Aftershocks"") effectively capturing the mayhem without having the audience lose their sense of placement.The downside to ""San Andreas"" is how obsessed it is with finding the most convenient quips, similar to ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" where it's constantly trying to be cheeky with its humor. There is a sequence that has Ray and Emma parachuting down onto second base in a Major League ballpark, with Ray, upon landing, remarking to Emma, ""It's been a while since I've gotten you to second base."" While that particular line is humorous, the remainder of the film always seems to be in search of that one perfect line that it subsequently squanders a lot of potential human interest.Human interest and believable dialog have been exercised in disaster films before. ""San Andreas,"" while covering solid ground on its own, still doesn't manage to match the artistic merits and sheer elegance of Steve Quale's ""Into the Storm,"" which managed to tag the human interest and dialog bases more effectively. It also doesn't manage to evoke the kind of suspense necessary to this genre, for it's always seeking the easiest, most celebratory way out of seemingly doomed situations for its characters that the outcome for certain perilous incidents becomes rather predictable. However, the realism of the chaos in ""San Andreas"" is what held my interest. Watching natural disasters play out in films, whilst not being in any danger yourself, is a wonderful trait that really exercises the very principles that cinema was founded upon; being immersed in an environment or being in the middle of action without ever leaving your seat or being in any conceivable danger. There are fine elements of chaotic filmmaking being explored here that will undoubtedly leave the average moviegoer wowed at what's placed before them.""San Andreas"" is the film for those who already completed their third rewatch of ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" and feel ""Ex Machina"" looks a bit ""too talky"" for them. On that note, and several others, it works just fine.",San Andreas
33,Hellmant,"Follows the basic 'disaster flick' formula, religiously!",5,4 June 2015,"'SAN ANDREAS': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The new big budget disaster flick starring The Rock (aka Dwayne Johnson) as a rescue-chopper pilot; who's trying to rescue his wife and daughter, from a series of large earthquakes in California. The movie was directed by Brad Peyton (who also directed Johnson in 'JOURNEY 2: THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND') and it was written by Carlton Cuse, Andre Fabrizio and Jeremy Passmore. It costars Paul Giamatti, Carla Gugino, Alexandra Daddario and Ioan Gruffudd. If you're looking solely for cool special effects, this movie is definitely for you; but anyone looking for a little more substance, will be sorely disappointed.Johnson plays a rescue-chopper pilot, named Ray, who works in San Andreas, California. His wife, Emma (Gugino), recently left him and moved in with another man (Gruffudd). Their daughter, Blake (Daddario), really wants Ray and Emma to get back together. When a major earthquake strikes San Andreas, Ray steals a chopper to go rescue Blake and Emma, who are stranded in different areas of the state.If you've seen one disaster flick, you've practically seen them all; this one follows the basic formula, religiously. I'm not a big fan of the genre; due to the utter lack of originality, and creativeness, in most Hollywood offerings of it (I did really enjoy 'TWISTER' and 'THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW' though; and of course 'TITANIC'). All of the characters, in this, are very generic; and cartoon like. I didn't find any of their drama interesting, or involving at all. The movie does have the routine spectacular effects and monstrous disaster moments, though (that fans are looking for). Those that just want a visual treat, and a few basic thrills, will probably really enjoy it. I even found last year's 'INTO THE STORM' to be more entertaining! I do like The Rock though; but this is one of his more forgettable roles.Watch our movie review show at: https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=zfYb1KqmKxo",San Andreas
34,Buddy-51,"Eye-popping spectacle, silly drama",6,23 April 2016,"In ""San Andreas,"" the world's most famous fault ruptures in so spectacular (and unlikely) a fashion that virtually the entire state of California is reduced to one heaping pile of ashes and rubble. And as dams burst and skyscrapers crumble, we're treated to a series of rescue stories involving characters that, quite frankly, we couldn't care less about. But then, again, no one really goes to a movie like ""San Andreas"" for thoughtful drama or incisive characterization. It's all about the destruction and carnage, and, in that respect, at least, it delivers the goods - with hyperkinetic action scenes and impressive special effects to compensate for some of the corny dialogue, tedious plot lines and scientific illiteracy that pockmark the picture. And don't think there isn't at least a little time carved out for a burgeoning romance and a few stolen kisses amidst all the death and devastation.Surrounded by thousands of fleeing, panic-stricken extras, the main actors, led by superhero Dwayne Johnson, include Carla Gugino, Paul Giamatti, Archie Panjabi, Ioan Gruffudd, Kylie Minogue, etc., all playing characters straight out of Stereotypes ""R"" US (there's even an old couple to share one last embrace before they perish together in an epic tidal wave that all but decimates San Francisco).My favorite moment comes when a seemingly well-versed, well- travelled character describes San Francisco's landmark Coit Tower as ""that tall cement nozzle thing on the hill.""

35,thesar-2,It's Because the Gays are Getting Married,3,17 June 2015,"The biggest thing San Andreas had going for it was not the special effects which were pretty well done. Nor was the best part the acting way above most big-budgeted, disaster b-movies, namely from the forever charismatic The Rock. The best thing going for this was the NUMEROUS opportunities to crack jokes throughout and mostly directly at the silliness of it all. Sure, it is, again, a big-budgeted, disaster b- movie, but it sure as hell gave me enough material to lean over to my friend in the theatre and say out loud what we were both thinking at the ridiculous scenes and set-ups we witnessed.I almost missed this in theatres, and boy, I wish I hadfor two reasons. The 3D – which, given the choice, I will ALWAYS opt out of and sadly, this was the only time that worked in our schedule, made everything very dark and along with the dim lights in the theatre and the small screen, it was hard to see a lot of what was going on. But, more importantly, I wish I had seen this at home, because I would have formulated one of my top 40 lists with all the jokes I had come up with in lieu of this standard review. I had so many zingers, which did crack us both up, but disappointedly, I couldn't pause to take notes.That all aside, the movie was so very one-note, I was left at the end saying: ""I've seen all this before in other movies, but those movies had so much more going for it, other than just an earthquake."" Putting away the obvious clichés, predictability and terribly boring ""story of heart, courage and getting my ex-family back!"" the movie characters, if I could give them so much credit, never seemed to understand what was happening to California. They must've REALLY been acting towards green screens because they carried on the most inane and hilariously bad conversations as if thousands of people weren't actually dying all around them. Further, and even sadder, when anything looked like it really would've been cool to see in the foreground, such as freeways collapsing, the Transamerica Pyramid falling over in San Francisco or the 90-story-up Mike O'Callaghan–Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge cracking and falling, we were subjected to our losers of heroes saying nothing of interest or barely reacting instead. What the heck movie was this? A Godzilla sequel?Add all that, plus a live-action cartoon wimp, a tsunami made silly and a far-too long opening set-up, this is only recommended as a drinking game or as an excuse of getting all your friends around to see who could come up with the best MST3k comments. Other than that, stay away, far away from this movie with more than one FAULT.",San Andreas

38,Robert_duder,"Rip roaringly entertaining, a disaster masterpiece",10,27 June 2015,"Another reviewer on IMDb gave this a 10/10 and they said that this was all the best parts of every disaster movie you've ever seen. That's not too far from the truth. It has been a long, long, LONG time since we have had a terrific disaster flick. Nowadays its all about the special effects and it becomes so ridiculous that you lose sight of what made disaster movies so great. San Andreas still goes for the jugular of modern day special effects but it also goes back to the disaster roots and uses all the familiar recipe ingredients to ensure this is ferociously enjoyable and it is!! It will never win Oscars (not including special effects) and its not some critical masterpiece but it is purely entertainment. It is the sort of popcorn, theatre flick that we rarely see anymore. Its the type of movie that reminds you why we all fell in love with movies. I smiled, I cringed, I cried out loud, I teared up...it was remarkable. I could watch this again and again without hesitation. The characters might be typical and some of the scenes predictable but it has been so long since someone got the disaster movie recipe right that I loved every minute of it. This is as much of an homage to the 70's Disaster era as it is a modern day spectacle of effects.Dwayne Johnson (in my books) went from ridiculous WWE wrestling that I haven't watched since I was 12 to trying his hand at acting and becoming the next big Hollywood star. In fact, he might be one of the only young Hollywood stars in recent years that I really enjoy watching him kick some serious butt. He has an incredible charisma on screen and he's just very likable and a great ""every-man's"" hero. He is perfect in this part and defines hero. Carla Gugino plays Johnson's estranged soon-to-be ex-wife. She plays a great part and her and Johnson seem like an odd couple and yet as their characters develop they are believable together and terrific. Alexandra Daddario is terrific as Johnson's daughter. First of all, she is gorgeous but she is also very down to earth, a great heroine, and very believable. She stands right up there with Johnson and gets noticed. Hugo Johnstone-Burt, Art Parkinson, Ioan Gruffudd and Paul Giamatti round out the supporting cast and literally all of them are terrific in their own way. They all have at least one or two scenes that are really great and the movie wouldn't be the same without them.Director Brad Peyton has done everything right with this film. He goes for the emotions, the intensity, the realism and for all the previous Earthquake films this one takes the cake. Remember the classic Disaster film ""Earthquake""? That was scary. San Andreas obliterates modern society and you believe it. You can't help but imagine what this would be like. It is one nail-biting, insane moment after another. The CGI is spot on (and I HATE CGI) but this was nearly perfect. Ironically, the only time the CGI was bad (really bad) was in a scene near the end with them in a boat. The Quake, the disaster itself, the Tsunami and the Hoover Dam scenes were amazing. If you're going into this looking for all the reasons why it isn't perfect then you'll find some. I went in looking for a good time and man did I find that in spades!! Incredibly entertaining, a terrific time at the movies and another huge 2015 blockbuster!!! 10/10",San Andreas
39,bowmanblue,Sorry Dwayne!,5,10 August 2017,"I have to start by saying that I do ten to watch anything that Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is in. For someone primarily known as an action star (and former wrestler to boot!) he does tend to offer *slightly* more range in the acting stakes than some of his contemporaries. Here, in 'San Andreas,' he doesn't have to utilise an awful lot of acting ability to portray a tough-as-nails helicopter pilot who must utilise his aerial skills to save his family when a freak earthquake hits the city. Yes, that's about the size of the plot. Anyway, I knew what I was getting. I've seen enough disaster movies to know the score – the actors normally come secondary to the special effects. And this film was no different.I began by actually quite enjoying the film. It doesn't take long before buildings start crumbling on a large scale and, when this happens, the special effects are indeed well done enough to at least make the devastation appear believable. Plus you have the ever-great Dwayne Johnson at the helm, who, as I've said, is always fun. However, it was about there that the fun started to come to an end.There's little even Johnson and the special effects department could do to prevent not only the city of San Andreas, but also the entire film, from slipping into oblivion. It was about a quarter into the film when I started asking the question: Is this film trying to be serious, or not? You see these kind of disaster movies do follow patterns, or to put it a little harsher, have their own clichés. And 'San Andreas' starts to conform to so many of these that I was left wondering if they were checking every box on purpose in some sort of 'self knowing' kind of way. Sadly, by the end of the film I can confirm that they never had their tongue anywhere near their cheek.Once the disaster is underway, we're also treated to the couple who have split up getting back together, their subsequent inability to die while all around them drop like flies and the search for the child in danger. Now, I could almost forgive all of those if it wasn't for the fact that some actors appeared to be doing possibly the worst British actors since Dick Van Dyke! (Feel free to correct me and look them up online and inform me that they really WERE true Brits – but I'd be shocked!) So, a film that could have been really good fun was only reasonably due to Johnson and the effects. It's a shame that they couldn't have at least tried to make the sub-plots a little more original, as it makes the film pretty forgettable if you've seen as many disaster movies as I have. Plus Paul Giamatti was wasted and only there to try and give the film more of an air of gravitas.",San Andreas
40,ThomasDrufke,The Definition of a Guilty Movie Pleasure,7,17 November 2015,"If you were to make a movie based on the San Andreas fault and need a lead that can make himself believable pretty much single handedly taking on an earthquake, you get The Rock to do it. There's no one better at these types of movies. Alright I'm exaggerating a little bit, but he is absolutely believable throughout the entire film. While it's certainly not the best film of the year by any stretch of the imagination, there is so much fun to be had with San Andreas from beginning to end.The Rock plays a Los Andeles fire and rescue pilot in the midst of pretty much the world's largest recorded earthquake. His wife, Carla Gugino, and daughter, Alexandra Daddario also happen to get caught up the mix with the earthquake, all while trying to re- establish their family together. Surprisingly, The Rock doesn't do all the action. In fact, Daddario and the two brothers she crosses paths with in San Francisco cover a great deal of the films main action. Her and the rest of the cast also ground the film which would otherwise be ridiculous, with reality. To a point in which I actually felt for the characters during some of the more emotional moments.The CGI is also noticeably very good for the most part. If it weren't for some of the weaker boat scenes towards the end, I would have said this film could get a special effects nomination. It's crazy that I'm even saying this film could be in the conversation for some technical Oscar, but you have to acknowledge where the film did things right. The story itself can be very cheesy at times but I don't think it ever tried to leap boundaries that it couldn't. Some of the one-liners are pretty bad, but like I said, it's a fun film to watch. Especially when you have one of the most beautiful women in the world, Daddario, giving a surprisingly solid performance.+Popcorn flick+Performances all around are solid+Daddario+CGI for the most part-Script isn't the best7.6/10",San Andreas

42,lesleyharris30,"Big Budget, Mediocre Story,",5,6 June 2015,"San Andreas is a mediocre movie with a reasonably well developed storyline and an average cast. It certainly has many enjoyable moments, the effects are outstanding, packed with many intense scenes, and some of the best acting I've ever seen from Dwayne Johnson, he had scenes, particularly with his wife, where he really got to shine and show that he is more than just a typical action star, his likability made the movie more bearable. It had a lot of potential, and judging from its budget, the studio really had faith in it, but it's main problem is it's poorly written, it jumps in to the adventure much too early, without giving us enough time to care for the characters and hoping for them to be safe beforehand, and, though I did like Paul Giamatti's performance, his character and story didn't really feel necessary, we could have simply followed Ray and his family, with news updates to inform us on what was happening, I don't think we needed that much time to understand what was going on, and that further weakened my care for the characters. Ioan Gruffudd's role is very disappointing, I think he's a very talented actor and was happy when I saw him on screen, but after the earthquake comes around the writers decided to make the audience hate him, but the way they do this is very confusing and the characters final scene was the most ridiculous part of the entire movie, it literally looked like a cartoon. It has good moments, but San Andreas is mostly a huge let down with poorly written characters and mostly dull performances, and I honestly couldn't recommend it. A rescue pilot heads on a journey across the state in order to find his daughter after a huge earthquake. Best Performance: Paul GiamattiWorst Performance: Art Parkinson",San Andreas
43,A_Different_Drummer,disaster in every possible sense of the word ... and then some,3,28 August 2015,"Possibly the worst ""disaster"" movie since the Poseiden Adventure.Makes the DAY AFTER TOMORROW (which actually was not a bad film) look like Oscar material.Horrible script. Horrible direction. Horrible special effects. The actors struggle, really and painfully struggle, to distinguish themselves in this ""pot luck dinner"" pretending to be a spectacle pretending to be an A-List movie, pretending to be entertainment.If you watch a lot of movies, you get used to the visual cues, the angles and sequences that directors use to bridge to the next big scene.Right off the top of this film -- at a stage where I really wanted to like the film, to enjoy it -- a quake rocks the Hoover Dam and forces Paul Giamatti and his fellow scientist to run for their lives. Giamatti makes it, and the other guy almost makes it but at the last second stops to help a young girl.Carrying the girl, the other scientist once again tries to make it to safety but, as he runs, the asphalt around him shatters. The visual cues indicated something big was coming, but the possibilities were limited. I remember thinking, the only result that would justify these angles and the suspense buildup would be if the gets the girl to safety but dies himself....? Sure enough, he has just enough energy to ""toss"" the girl to safety -- sorta like a football -- as he himself gets his spine shattered by the quake catching up to him.At that point, this movie and I were no longer pals.A few minutes later, there is a scene where Dwayne Johnson's ""young daugther,"" played by 30 year old Alexandra Daddario -- whom one IMDb reviewer suggested ""should try a porn film"" -- is parked in an office lobby and treated like a 15 year old. Was that in the script? Was she playing younger? Did she win the part in a game show? Or, is that scene merely typical of the general lack of consistency one has to expect if you have to sit through this film right to the end? I suggest the latter. You have been warned.",San Andreas

45,callanvass,Very entertaining for a disaster flick,7,19 June 2015,"Ray (The Rock), a rescue chopper-pilot, is having major family issues. He is not over the death of his daughter Mallory and he is still in love with his wife (Gugino), from whom he is separated from. Ray goes to spend some time with his daughter, Blake. (Daddario), but finds out his wife has moved in with her boyfriend Daniel (Gruffudd) . When A humongous Earthquake begins to hit California, Ray is forced to cancel his time with his daughter. Daniel takes his daughter instead. During the earthquake, Blake gets put in a very precarious position and Daniel abandons her. His wife gets put in serious danger as well. Ray must overcome all the obstacles to save his family.I was pretty excited to see this movie. I've been a huge fan of The Rock's for years. Disaster movies can be hit or miss, but the trailers I saw looked pretty awesome. The story isn't anything special. It's pretty routine, but it gets the job done very efficiently. I got very attached to Ray's family. For something as simple as Disaster movie, that's a pretty big feat. Not only is the cast extremely talented, but the characters have some depth to them, despite a relatively ordinary script. The last 30 minutes are filled with genuine emotion and lots of suspense. I was really surprised by how much it kept me guessing. The ending toyed with my heart a bit and I was unsure of what was going to happen for once. This movie won't contend for academy awards, but it's a blast to watch. It's big, loud and I loved every minute of it. If you're an adrenaline junkie like I am, you won't be disappointed. The Rock has become a huge box office draw. This movie made a lot of money and he's earned it. He's become a very dependable leading man. I believed in his plight and I was with him every step of the way. Carla Gugino is great as the love interest. Daddario is really easy on the eyes, but a pretty good actress as well. She was strong-willed, but vulnerable as well. I thought she conveyed all emotions very well. She's going places. Johnstone-Burt and Parkinson are fantastic as Ben and Ollie. They are very likable as the Brothers. They provided laughs and became a big reason this movie was so entertaining. Paul Giamatti's role is kinda thin, but he was pretty solid. I had a good time at the movies! It's one of the better disaster movies I've seen. I'm going through a really rough time right now. This movie provided me with a nice distraction.

47,vincentlynch-moonoi,Bull toddy (and that's putting it politely),6,18 June 2015,"Special effects + 10 Acting = 7 Geology = 7 Believable plot = 0 Overall score =6I knew I would be disappointed by this film. The reason -- I expected directorial excess. And that's exactly what I got.In terms of special effects: bravo! Can't imagine it being more stunning.In terms of acting: fairly good. Dwayne Johnson has tuned out to be a better actor than most of us expected; I enjoy him on screen. The supporting actors (they all are, because the film belongs to Johnson) all do reasonably well. No real criticisms, although this isn't Shakespeare and that level of acting certainly isn't required.Geology: well, even as a guy with 2 degrees in the Geosciences, I'll give this a ""7"". Not because it's that accurate in terms of the big picture, but because Californians have no iota of understanding of what may very well be coming their way one of these days. If this film made any of them nervous, then the overstatement of the geological situation served its purpose. That the entire fault line would adjust pretty much all at one time is not very believable, and that serves to point out one of my big issues with this film -- how often does the worst case scenario in almost anything actually happen? Well, here you have the worst, worst, worst, worst, worst, worst, worst, worst, worst, worst case scenario happening. Catch my drift -- excess to the nth degree.The other place where excess enters into the picture is with a believable plot. Almost every situation that Dwayne's character, his wife, and his daughter find themselves in (separately or together) are virtually impossible to survive. And yet, they survive one after another of these truly extreme situations. Some have mentioned brain damage to the daughter in the drowning scene. I'm not sure about that, but I am fairly sure that the script writers had brain damage. If the film was only based on believability, I would give the overall film a ""0"". In terms of believability, the old ""Earthquake"" film with Charlton Heston was far more believable.I guess young audiences like one thrill after another, even when it makes the film nothing but lurid fantasy. We older guys want to believe something is really possible. So for me, overall, the movie is a thumbs-down.",San Andreas

But if in case you have seen ~10 movies in your life, you have already seen ""San Andreas"".

49,westsideschl,More to Fear,2,19 October 2015,Starts out stupid and gets stupider (starting with the first quake event): 1. Very fake scene of a car stuck on the side of a cliff. The downwash from the copter's blades would have increased the likelihood of car going bye-bye . The whole event was more incredulously laughable than believable. 2. The usual backstory of family issues so stereotypically common in these types of movies. Producers telling writers about demographics and its relation to making loads of audience money. 3. Film industry's stereotypes of scientists continues unabated. Have these writers ever been around anyone with a science background? 4. Continues image stereotype of a tough hero with narcissistic muscle mass and overly tight tees to sell that image to female paying viewers. Must be the only image appropriate for our role model for heroic deeds. 5. Improbabilities abound everywhere as family and friends happen upon one another though out all the havoc. And/or happen to rescue or survive harrowing life ending events. 6. Final scene of our flag unfurling to inspiring music. I guess it means even with a city destroyed and millions dying there is still a reason to still be positive. On a positive note: 1. Good use of the latest computer hardware/software to show things breaking apart. 2. All the destructive scenes are about as likely as an asteroid hitting the same city. So southern Cal peoples can sleep except for the other more likely tragedies.,San Andreas
50,ironhorse_iv,"It was entertaining, but what a disaster! This Earthquake Movie hit Rock Bottom, indeed.",6,3 June 2015,"This movie felt a bit, mediocre and flat. The reasons why, is because the movie follow disaster movie trope, way too much. It also kinda carbon copy, plots from other disasters films. It felt so unoriginal. There was nothing really special about this film, at all! Directed by Brad Peyton, the movie tells story of a Los Angeles Fire Department search-and-rescue chopper pilot Ray Gaines (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) whom, must rescue his family, after a massive earthquake has struck the whole state of California. Without spoiling the movie, too much, half the time, that I was watching it, I felt like I was rewatching 2009's 2012, yet again, because it has a divorce father stopping at nothing to rescue his family from the ruins a massive earthquake creates around them. It's so clichés. It's not San Andreas's fault, it's the producers, writers, and director's fault. This movie didn't hit, it's magnitude of great writing. While, the movie plot is pretty bland. At least, the visuals were somewhat, alright. Still, there were some moments in the film that I really found to be, a bit jarring and unrealistic looking. The whole, beginning scene with the falling car, look a bit, cheap-looking. This might not be Earth shaking news to anybody watching this film, but it needs to be, said. The science, behind the earthquakes was a bit shaking. Of course, Hollywood will paints a bigger-than-life picture and plays with the truth in order to entertain, but for fun sakes, let's try to separate fact from fiction, for a bit. There is some criticism from scientific circles on the certainty of 'wall-to-wall' scenario, in which the film shows the whole San Andreas Fault, doing. In my opinion, Hollywood went a little far-fetch, with the ""wall-to-wall"" ruptured scenario, in which the entire San Andreas Fault, extending from near the Mexican border almost to Oregon, break away from the main land. One of the biggest mistakes is how San Andreas Fault breaks apart and forms a massive gap in the wrong direction. This kind of rupture has never been seen and is a highly unlikely, given both historic and paleo-earthquake records. It reminds me, so much of 2004's TV miniseries '10.5', how ridicules, the science is in this film. While, I'm not a state seismologist, I think, anybody with a brain, would know that. Still, the movie does bring up, some interesting geology information, worth-noting. It's somewhat, true, that Nevada, could have earthquakes on their own, but a fault in Nevada connects to the San Andreas fault to form some sort of superfault, is highly unlikely. Another thing is in reality, any San Andreas earthquake would had magnitude would be closer to 8.3, not 9 or over as depicted in the movie. Even if it's possible, tall skyscrapers shouldn't fall, so easily like that. Tall skyscrapers are actually designed to sway back and forth during a quake to prevent serious structural damage. One of the things that really got me, out of the film is people being able to run around, with ease, during an earthquake. I really couldn't shake that off, because, for me, having survive, multiply earthquakes in the past, I really didn't buy into that. The movie had somewhat, a good pace. Constant rampant destruction -- collapsing buildings, rubble, people getting crushed or nearly crushed, kept the movie from being boring. There are hardly, any slow spots in the film, but sadly, I really couldn't take any of the destruction risk, seriously as a threat. Knowing the director, and the film being rated PG-13, I really doubt, that any notable character would had die in the film. It's seem very unlikely. While, the enormity and frequency of the massive-scale destruction can be overwhelming to anybody who suffer from recent large-scale earthquakes. It felt a bit less upsetting, due to the lack of gore. The acting in the film is alright for the most part. I just wish, people show, more fear. Dwayne Johnson seem, a bit mellow out that the world is going to sh*t. They didn't really show his charisma, in this film and he comes across as somewhat plain. It was disappointing. The movie, at first, made it seem like the film is going to be about his Search & Rescue crew and him, doing missions, but half-way, through the film. He just abandoned, his crew and they are never again, brought up. For a character to be a lead helicopter pilot for search and rescue missions. It seem like, a let-down. It's also, a bit, unlikely, he know, how to fly a plane, or also drive a boat. Supporting characters like Alexandra Daddario, as Ray's daughter, Blake seem, out of place. She looks nothing like Dwayne Johnson or Carla Gugino. I really didn't like, her romantic sub-plot, with Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt). It seem a bit, much. Her acting was weak. It seem like, she was brought in, just to be eye-candy. Even an acclaimed actor like Paul Giamatti as Geologist, Lawrence Hayes seem a bit frail. He does little, but speak in severe, warning-filled exposition dialogue like any other scientist in a disaster film. Ioan Gruffudd is stuck in the role that makes him, looks like a villain due to his cowardly, but he come across, to me, as a man who living through, some really bad trauma, and just happens to be totally helpless. While massive destruction and disaster are the main points of the movie, there are underlying messages about teamwork and helping people, and the main character is a heroic pilot who risks himself to save others. Overall: Visually, it's alright, but the bad writing, full of cheaply done exposition, cheesy dialogue, odd coincidence, and bad shortcuts into the mix with half-drawn characters makes it, average, at best. Just go if you're looking to be distracted for 2 hours. Just don't think too much. It's dumb fun.",San Andreas
51,The-Sarkologist,The Rock vs The Earthquake,7,30 May 2015,"There is really only one reason you go and see disaster movies and that is for the cheese – and this one has it in spades. They all have the same plot: there is this really big disaster and the family of the hero is separated so they must defy all of the odds and head into the middle of the disaster zone and rescue them. Throw in one of them dying and a frantic dose of first aid only for them to start coughing and everybody hugs, look at the disaster that has struck, and say 'well, at least we're alive. We will rebuild'. Oh, and also throw in the stars and stripes unfurling from a destroyed Golden Gate Bridge and you have your Hollywood disaster movie.As can be expected the hero of our movie is a search and rescue officer for the LA fire department, but as it turns out he is not just any search and rescue officer – he and his team did two tours of duty in Afghanistan, and as it happens they are the best. Yet, for some strange and unexplained reason three of the team disappear at the beginning of the movie leaving The Rock to take all of the credit (but then again, he is The Rock).It is one of those movies that has plenty of those 'seriously? For real!' moments. For instance, The Rock happens to work for the LA Fire Department and a massive Earthquake has just hit Los Angeles (with a rippling ground and all of the buildings in the CBD collapsing) and when he discovers that his wife is trapped at the top of one of the buildings he just turns the chopper around and rescues her (just before the entire building collapses mind you – while everybody else in the building ends up being killed, but then again they didn't listen to The Rock – they went downstairs and not onto the roof). Okay, rescuing his wife is fine, but then they discover that their daughter is stuck in San Francisco and as it happens the earthquake has struck their as well, so he just takes the LA Fire Department helicopter for a spin up to San Francisco, despite the fact that they might need it in Los Angelese (and as it happens, by the end of the movie it seems as if everybody has forgotten that the earthquake also wiped out Los Angeles).To add to the endless number of clichés that just happen to riddle this film (but then, what would you expect from a disaster movie), The Rock has just received divorce papers from his wife, namely because his wife has met another man. Yeah, okay, that happens all the time; it just so happens that the guy that she met is the controlling partner of one of the largest architectural firms in the United States – yes, the guy's like a billionaire, a billionaire who never got around to marrying, until he met The Rock's ex-wife. However such things are not meant to be because it also turns out that this guy is a coward and ends up leaving his daughter trapped in a car in the sub-basement of one of his buildings, who is then rescued by some guy that she met while sitting in the foyer only a few minutes before.So, that's basically it. A disaster movie. Buildings fall down, things blow up, and massive container ships are picked up by a tidal wave (that only hits San Francisco by the way) and is subsequently used to take out the Golden Gate Bridge. If you don't want something too draining with some pretty decent effects, and a few laughs at the inexplicable clichés, then you will probably like this movie.",San Andreas

The visuals are absolutely incredible, so if this was the only thing you wanted to see in a disaster movie, you've come to the right place. Planning and making this film must have been a huge undertaking. The film suffers from the same cliches as most disaster films do, though, where a failed marriage is saved by disaster. Enough already, Hollywood, find other ways to cause conflict between the protagonists.I thought Alexandra Daddario was particularly good (in the role of Blake Gaines). With a little more film experience I think she should be opted as the new Lara Croft. On the other hand, Ioan Gruffudd was terrible!

55,eddie_baggins,Some nice CGI carnage can't save the day,4,22 May 2016,"The Rock's certainly one charismatic cat but while San Andreas isn't a catastrophically bad movie, not even the charms of Dwayne Johnson can save this big budget spectacle from an overwhelming sense of meh, thanks to a corn ridden script, uninteresting characters and a feeling of déjà vu.See the thing is, we've all seen San Andreas before. Whether it be 2012, Deep Impact or any other number of other natural disaster films and for a film of this ilk to succeed it needs to excel at something to really wow us, the viewers that have been treated to such tales since the dawn of cinematic magic and San Andreas never has the charms or smarts to overcome its many weaknesses.Director Brad Peyton certainly brings nothing to the table other than a few neatly constructed CGI set pieces and he wastes an able cast amongst San Andreas's 100 minute plus runtime and it's actually quite hilarious in one of those sad kind of ways concerning the way in which the once more slumming it Paul Giamatti, poor old Ioan Gruffudd and even Australia's very own pop princess Kylie Minogue are used.Well adverse to making otherwise dull tales more enjoyable than they should be (see Hercules for proof) Dwayne Johnson alongside Carla Gugino can't do much with a role that literally sees him spend half his screen time flying a helicopter around and talking about his marital woes. We've all grown to love the Rock thanks to his action prowess, his quick wit and his everyman persona but San Andreas never gives the one time jock wearing wrestler time to do his thing.Some nice Australian shot locations and some relatively ""special"" special effects save San Andreas from going underwater and getting caught in its scripts many fault lines and it's hard to ever hate something with the Rock in it but San Andreas is barely passable popcorn entertainment that's very far from memorable.2 Rays Outdoors stores out of 5",San Andreas
56,filipemanuelneto,A CGI show in an entertaining film.,6,19 December 2020,"""Another earthquake film in which California will be obliterated."" That's what I thought when I discovered this film. I was not mistaken. It's just another disaster film, similar to so many others in its mistakes and virtues: it's stupid, but it entertains wonderfully.Against the backdrop of the famous ""Big One"", the devastating earthquake that hangs over California like a Damocles Sword, the film follows the efforts of a veteran of the Los Angeles Emergency Services to save her own daughter in San Francisco, in a story that is perhaps the most odd I have ever seen in a disaster film. He totally ignores his professional duty, selfishly choosing to save those who matter to him instead of presenting to his service and saving as many lives as possible. Of course, in the midst of all, he saves other people, if he were not the hero, but it was not what motivated him. And of course, the daughter proved to be totally capable of getting away with herself when everything seemed like the Apocalypse.The cast is led by an actor I have never particularly liked, Dwayne Johnson, but who has risen considerably in my expectations since he proved to be more than just a muscle mount. He's not brilliant, but he has improved and choose more carefully his roles, gaining with that. Here, he does what he has to do and gets along reasonably well, but he does not establish any chemistry with Carla Gugino, who plays the ex-wife he still cares about, and who seems to be acting with a wall instead of a human actor. Paul Giamatti is a noble actor who is used to dignified characters and with a certain charisma, and he had everything he needs here. Alexandra Daddario, on the other hand, brings to the film a dose of charm and fun in the feminine, in addition to a beautiful curvaceous body.Personally, I think that what draws the most attention in this film, in addition to the most comical moments that lighten the tension, is the massive dose of CGI where the film spent a notable slice of the budget. And California has never been more beautifully devastated! The CGI is wonderful and there are visually extraordinary scenes that make us think that only in a movie can someone escape by a hair for a wall falling the next instant. With the massive dose of destruction, so realistic that we can smell it, and the decent work of the cast, the film makes up for any defects with solid entertainment and acquires value for that very reason.",San Andreas
57,leonblackwood,"Great CGI, poor storyline! 5/10",5,19 October 2015,"Review: This big budget movie looked extremely impressive and the director made the most out of CGI  graphics but the storyline is corny and badly written. With that aside, it's very realistic in terms of the actually earthquake and the tumbling buildings so I have to commend the director for that. The whole movie is based in San Andreas, California were a helicopter rescue pilot Ray (Dwayne Johnson), is out to save his family during a critical earthquake. He's in the process of divorcing his wife, Emma (Carla Gugino) who is going to live with a high flying English business man, with there daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) but when the disaster strikes, his focus is completely on saving them. At the time of the earthquake, Blake was in a limousine at the bottom of an office building with her mothers boyfriend Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd), who leaves her in the car to save his own life but she gets rescued by Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) and his little brother. She then manages to contact her father, so he speeds to her rescue after saving Emma from a falling building. The only problem is that the earthquake has become more ferocious, so it's a case of using planes, boats and automobiles to get to daughter. The acting was a bit sketchy along with the fact that everyone looked perfectly fine after going through such a disaster but thats Hollywood for ya. The director seemed to have spent most of his time on the green screen than on the script because it's corny as hell but you can't help rooting for the Rock, who didn't let anything phase him. With all of the falling buildings, floods and dead bodies the director should have shown what other families were going through during such a disaster. He basically just concentrated on 5 individuals, who wasn't the most interesting of characters but he did try to give some depth to the family, by introducing the dead daughter element. Anyway, if you take away the corny music/script the movie isn't bad and it shows how far the Rock has come with his acting abilities but there is much better disaster movies out there. Watchable, mainly for the graphics!Round-Up: Although everyone was putting down the Rock when he first started his acting career in Welcome to the Jungle and Walking Tall, he has definitely come a long way in terms of perfecting his acting style and being able to show emotion on camera. Everyone loved him in the Mummy franchise but he struggled to find his niche in Hollywood because of his highly successful wrestling career. After starring in Doom in 2005, he turned to comedy in Be Cool were he sported a funny afro alongside John Travolta and then he starred in the lead in Southland Tales which didn't go down to well with critics. After that he turned to sport movies in the under-rated Gridiron Gang and Disney's the Game Plan and then he switched back to comedic roles in Get Smart, Race To Witch Mountain and the Other Guys. He then started to get taken seriously after his role in Faster but right after that he brought out Tooth Fairy which didn't do his career any good. He bounced back in the Fast and Furious franchise whilst starring in Journey 2, GI Joe and the disappointing Empire State but he was brilliant in Pain & Gain and Snitch. Hercules wasn't that great but I enjoyed the Ballers series and he held his own alongside Vin Diesel in the latest Fast and Furious movie. With 17 movies in the pipeline which include a Big Trouble in Little China remake, Shazaam, Journey 3 and Fast and Furious 8, he has definitely come far after his young wrestling days, which he still does on the side. This film was directed by Brad Peyton who brought you Cats and Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore and Journey 2: The Mysterious Island so this is definitely a new genre for him. He done well in terms of making a profit for this movie and I was impressed with how real the whole film looked but it still could have done with a rewrite. For a disaster movie, it ticked all the boxes but it lacked originality from my point of view.Budget: $110million Worldwide Gross: $470.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/drama/thrillers starring Dwayne Johnson, Carla Gugino, Paul Giamatti, Ioan Gruffudd and a special appearance by Kylie Minogue. 5/10",San Andreas
58,TheMovieDiorama,"San Andreas vibrationally shakes its cast off the ground and into implausible, unlikely and downright lucky situations.",4,16 July 2019,"Disaster films have never been my pleasure, heck they're not even my guilty pleasure. Films designed to showcase state-of-the-art visual effects, masquerading a plot that is, more often than not, stupid beyond belief. Ding ding! Oh, looks like we have a winner. This blockbuster measured a magnitude of ""purposefully preposterous"" on the Richter scale (and yes, I'm aware it's a numbered system...). A series of earthquakes caused by the San Andreas Fault pummels a helicopter-rescue pilot into traversing the entire western coast in order to save his ex-wife and daughter before a skyscraper falls on them or something.As endearing and heroic as The Rock is, I hope his character got fired after this event. He only saved a handful of people and wasted so many precious minutes attempting to reignite his internal flame for the Gugino sex bomb, that his loyalty and priorities were skewed right from the first camera shake. Screw the public asking for assistance! Right, let me start by saying the film succeeds in what it sets out to do. It's a mildly entertaining popcorn-munching effects extravaganza that harks back to classic 90s disaster flicks. The visuals were decent, the main cast members were charismatic and the much promise of a British chum dissecting the etymology behind ""Nob Hill"". What more do you desire? One could ask. Oh, I don't know, maybe some genuine logic that doesn't perpetuate geological absurdities?I'll start with Giamatti's seismologist. An obligatory character used to accentuate the ridiculous behaviour of the fault line. On several occasions, the reporting team constantly interviewing him say something like ""he tried to warn you, but no one listened"". Umm...excuse me, miss. Yeah. As soon as he discovered that he could predict earthquakes, the whole frickin' country started to shift. He never had time to warn anyone! So don't paint him to be this angelic hero, he left his friend to die on the Hoover Dam because he couldn't be bothered to run towards him. Instead, much like with every line Giamatti shouted, he rampantly screamed ""Take cover! Run! Get to the barriers! It'll be over soon! Run! Run! Earthquake! Run!"". Oh, but then you get lines like ""Right now, I wish I were so wrong. God be with you..."" as if he's part of Europe's 'The Final Countdown' music video! Calm down on the epic stares, dear. Your overacting is hurting my eyes. Never mind the science that was mind-bogglingly underdeveloped and unexplainable.Then we get to the main cast, the Gaines' and their two British pals that Talk like This because They musT pronounce all of Their Ts in The mosT Typical BriTish accenT of all Time. Naturally, with a plot as absurd as San Andreas', there are so many moments when these characters escape death just in the last second of a building collapsing or a helicopter crashing, that you start to believe that they're incarnates of religious deities. No one is constantly that lucky. If Kylie Minogue pummels to her death whilst inhibiting her native Australian vocals for an American accent (actually not bad!), then no one should live. Mr. Not-So-Fantastic makes an appearance as the film's mandatory selfish meanie, which only provided one excellent phone call from Gugino regarding her daughter. The tsunami sequence contained an absurd amount of noticeable green screen that I felt my eyes artificially becoming blinder by the minute. Oh, and how could I forget about the introductory sequence with the girl in her car, and the helicopter managing to balance itself in the tight crevice of a canyon whilst her car is locked into place vertically by a few pebbles. Say no more, say no more.Anyway, I know what you are all going to say. ""It's supposed to be dumb fun!"". And sure, I cherish ""dumb fun"" like the rest of you. But there is only so much dumb I can take before I start to question the logic and realism that the film exhumes (hint: none). There's only so much destruction before my mind becomes numb to it. Despite some catastrophic visuals and a dependable cast, San Andreas shakes its plot too ferociously for its own good. The last ten minutes being a prime example of that.",San Andreas

What doesn't, The Rock and the Disney-fying of anyone dying.What do I mean? The Rock is hit and miss in this one, he pulls of some great scenes whereas others are just a bridge too far (he may have caught this from Fast Furious). The effects are excellent. The deaths are sanitised for perhaps younger viewers, the cost of this is tension and any real concern you may have had for the family.

60,matthewssilverhammer,"Big, Dumb Fun",7,5 June 2015,"The disaster genre isn't a high-brow affair, with films opting for exciting destruction in lieu of compelling characters and dialogue. At one point during San Andreas, a character describes another character as ""cute, not bright""; that is an apt description of these films, SA included. It's predictability and dumbness are earth-shattering, so clearly it could be a better film. However, with fun 90's-era action set-pieces bolstered by state-of-the-art effects, San Andreas just plain works in spite of itself. With corny, melodramatic emotional beats drowning in giant and impressive action scenes, this skillfully made cookie-cutter flick is easy to enjoy. Story is not its strong suit; sloppy coincidences and ""get outta there!""-type dialogue abound. What you do need to know is that it's also full of buildings falling, big things breaking, and beautiful people screaming as they try to survive the most epic earthquake in history. Utilizing some great faux-long takes and a sure-hand with the CGI, we are given some truly exciting and unique thrills. The cast does a commendable job heightening their performances to the eye-rolling cheese in the material, managing to get us just emotionally invested enough. Johnson is a pure movie star, Daddario is pleasantly unshrill, and I'll never tire of Giamatti. Most impressive is its ability to remain appropriately somber as we celebrate the triumphs. The immense amount of faceless death is anchored by the movie being so concerned with helping others. Sure, it's done with some not-so-thinly-veiled 9/11 allusions, but those negatives are mostly harmless and even noble within the extraordinary annihilation. Like a tsunami of tension, San Andreas is a big, dumb fun.",San Andreas

It shows an entire city not only being hit by the biggest and strongest earthquake in history but then hit by a three hundred foot high tsunami that finishes the job. This is the disaster movie of disaster movies. No need for a strong story here. The special effects provide more than enough drama. The actual characters in the movie are ancillary to the story. It's about nature going wild, and on a scale that is beyond measuring. At the conclusion of the movie, San Francisco is a mess. Paul Giamatti is fantastic, and also quite amusing, as the scientist who predicts that the earthquake will strike - and nobody believes him until it is too late. By that time, the Hoover Dam is history and the rest of California is next in line. LA also gets hit, hard, but the director saves the best special effects for San Francisco.

65,stevendbeard,Great Summer Disaster Movie,7,29 May 2015,"I saw ""San Andreas"", starring Dwayne Johnson-the Fast & Furious movies, Tooth Fairy; Carla Gugino-Sucker Punch, Night at the Museum; Alexandra Daddario-the Percy Jackson movies, White Collar_tv and Paul Giamatti-The Amazing Spider-Man 2, Shoot 'Em Up.This is a disaster movie that does it right. Lots of fantastic looking action-it's never boring-and good actors. Dwayne plays a search & rescue helicopter pilot that is going through a divorce with Carla. They had two daughters. One of them died in a boating accident that Dwayne blames himself for-for not saving her. This caused a wedge between Dwayne & Carla, so she decided to move on, with their surviving daughter, Alexandra. FYI: Alexandra has the prettiest eyes! Anyway, Paul plays a seismologist working at Caltech. He studies earthquakes and sees a huge one coming, so he tries to warn people but, of course, no one listens-they never do, in these movies. The first quake hits the Hoover Dam in Nevada but Paul sees that this is just the beginning because it sets off the San Andreas fault-which runs some 800 miles up and down the length of California-and tries again to warn people, this time, with a little more success-probably because of what happened at the Hoover Dam. The main emphases of the movie is Dwayne trying to rescue his estranged wife and missing daughter. During this searching, you get to see what it would probably look like if this really happened; the Golden Gate bridge, the Hollywood sign, and Hoover dam all destroyed by the quakes, falling buildings, boats and even a Tsunami! FYI: In real life, the largest recorded earthquake was in Chile with a 9.5 on the Richter scale. In this movie, they have a 9.6. Oh yeah, if you are a Kylie Minogue fan then you are in luck, because she has a cameo-look for her in a restaurant scene with Carla, just before the quake hits. It's rated ""PG-13"" for disaster type action and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes. I really enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",San Andreas

67,alindsay-al,A below average dumb disaster movie,4,14 August 2017,"This film has the rock in it which is always a big appeal for me so I decided to see San Andreas and this film isn't particularly good. The premise of this film sees a rescue helicopter pilot attempt to find his ex wife and daughter in the midst of the worst earthquakes in history. Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson plays the lead in this film and he is really good in this film. He plays the everyday parent trying to save his kid really well and he also has the charisma to give himself some much needed personality. The same cannot be said for the supporting cast, Carla gugino plays his ex wife in this film and I just never really bought there relationship in this film so it made it really hard for me to care about her character. Alexandra daddaro plays there daughter in this film and I found her performance to be really over the top and poorly written. I also found it pretty hard to care about her character even though the film goes out of its way to really try to make you. Paul giamatti is in this film as an expert of earthquakes and he gives a really over the top performance. There are times in this film when you can tell that he is trying to give a decent performance but then the script comes in and his dialogue creates a really ridiculous character. Everybody else in this film is really cheesy and over the top and it makes it hard to care about anybody other then The Rock. The story of the film is disaster movie generic as they come, there are some decent personal moments that make you care about The Rock which is key to caring in this film. But as mentioned before the plot for this movie is as generic as possible and there are just too many moments that are just sigh worthy. The script as also mentioned before is pretty terrible filled with cheesy ridiculous dialogue that really hurts everybody involved and the film as a whole. The style of the film is really what we come to see this film for and I will admit there are some really cool disaster action set pieces in this film that will definitely entertain. However some of the effects didn't feel fully finished, especially at the beginning of the film there are some pretty bad effects that make this film feel incredibly unrealistic. Overall this film isn't really worth watching at all unless you like disaster movies for what they really are, films to turn your mind off but have no depth.",San Andreas
68,estebangonzalez10,A dull disaster movie that doesn't offer anything new to the genre,4,31 May 2015,"""It's been a long time since I got you to second base!""No matter how big of a fan of anyone from this cast you are, the entire screenplay is so full of clichés and the dialogue is almost entirely laughable that it makes it impossible for any one of them to save this film. Not even Dwayne Johnson (and he is an actor who usually delivers in action movies). This disaster movie is no different than The Day After Tomorrow, 2012, or Deep Impact. It is full of clichés and relies solely on CGI, but it doesn't have a soul. We've seen each one of these characters in dozens of movies before and I honestly didn't care for any of them in this film. It takes the familiar family dynamics from Taken, where a divorced father has to save his beautiful teenage daughter, while struggling with the fact that his ex-wife is moving in with a wealthy man, and it mixes it with the familiar elements of disaster movies like 2012. So in summary, it is basically a cross between 2012 and Taken. The effects didn't really blow me away either and the best scenes are already included in the trailers. I didn't hate San Andreas, but it doesn't deliver anything fresh or original. It's a disaster movie that lives up to being just that: a disaster.The film introduces us to the hero right away as Ray (Dwayne Johnson), a rescue- chopper pilot is saving a teenage girl from a car accident as it has derailed off the road and is barely hanging in the air squeezed by some rocks along a mountainside. After the successful rescue mission, Ray gives his daughter, Blake (Alexandra Daddario) a call to invite her out for the night, but she and her mother Emma (Carla Gugino) have already made plans with Emma's new boyfriend, Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd) a wealthy business magnate. Ray and Blake make plans to hang out together the next day, but a massive earthquake in Nevada sends him on yet another rescue mission. In the meantime, Lawrence (Paul Giamatti), an expert in all things concerning earthquakes and tectonic plate movements develops a program that allows him to predict possible earthquakes in the future. He predicts that the Nevada quake is just the beginning of the disaster and that California will be hit the hardest. His prediction comes true as Los Angeles and San Francisco begin to shake. On his way back, Ray receives a call from Emma who is in a building in LA that is about to collapse. Emma happens to be in another building all the way in San Francisco with Daniel that is also falling apart. Ray makes it his mission to save both his ex-wife and his daughter before the quake completely destroys both cities. Meanwhile, Blake is saved by a pair of Brits, Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) and his young brother Ollie (Art Parkinson), but this is just the beginning and more massive earthquakes are expected to hit them soon. Having the hero of the film play a rescue-chopper is a great excuse for the director, Brad Peyton (who had previously worked with Johnson in Journey 2: The Mysterious Island), to include jaw dropping aerial shots of the destruction. There are dozens of buildings collapsing and thousands of lives lost as Ray is trying to save his family. The CGI effects are solid, although nothing we haven't seen before. It delivers what audiences are expecting from a disaster movie, but the characters are never fully developed. The dialogue in this film is incredibly dull and its hard to care for the characters despite how much of a fan you are of the cast. There are some funny moments thanks to the chemistry between Johnstone and Daddario, but there is not much more here. You know exactly who is going to survive and who is not so there is no tension either. It's a film you come to see for the visuals alone and nothing else. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",San Andreas
69,jimbo-53-186511,"It's overblown and exaggerated, but it's also entertaining and has a premise that isn't as detached from reality as many people may think",7,14 July 2016,"When a massive earthquake hits California, rescue pilot Raymond Gaines (Dwayne Johnson) finds himself in a race-against-time battle to try to rescue his ex-wife Emma (Carla Gugino) and daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario). Meanwhile, following the aftermath of the first earthquake Doctor Lawrence Hayes (Paul Giamatti) and his team believe that they have found a way of detecting where earthquakes are going to happen prior to them 'happening' and make it their mission to warn everyone to get out of San Francisco while they still can.If you strip this film down to its bare bones this is a fairly generic action film; heroic protagonist must try to rescue his family (in this case though rather than protecting them from a villain he is trying to rescue them from Mother Nature which is an altogether more terrifying prospect). I think what makes this film more terrifying lies in the fact that it could actually happen; San Francisco is on a major fault line and has had its fair share of Earthquakes. In this film, all the filmmakers have done is slightly exaggerated this real-world problem and wrapped it up in a neat package that on the one hand is reasonably entertaining and on the other hand it provides us with nuggets of information explaining away what we are bearing witness to. In San Andreas, both of these elements compliment each other very well (the scientific aspect kept me informed without boring me and the rest of the narrative was strong enough to keep me involved in the story).One other thing that this film has in its favour is the likability of the characters; Ray is your typical action movie protagonist in that he's tough when required, but is also a man that is loving and devoted to his family. Likewise, it would have been so easy to make his daughter a 'weak damsel-in-distress character', but she's ballsy, resourceful and brave (which are all admirable traits and are things that give the film added weight).Whilst no-one gives a performance here worthy of an Oscar nod I have to admit that some of the acting here was really good; the ever reliable Paul Giamatti was excellent. Dwayne Johnson can do tough-guy stuff in his sleep, but I was surprised at how good he was at the emotive stuff. All the supporting cast were also fine as well.Although San Andreas is a good film in the main there were a few weaknesses here and there; for a start, I got the impression at times that director Brad Peyton was a little too in love with the special effects side of things (there was clearly a lot of money thrown at this project and I felt that Peyton wanted everyone to know that). Also Emma's husband serves no real purpose in the story (after we bear witness to his cowardice), but yet we're still shown scenes of him later trying to survive the Earthquake - although there is a wonderful example of Karma surrounding his character later in the film so his inclusion in later scenes is both good and bad.San Andreas is not a brilliant film and it is far from perfect, but it is an entertaining film that covers its 110 minute running time effortlessly. Yes it's a bit cheesy, clichéd, exaggerated and overblown, but it's also a film that I felt had something to say and that is just one of the reasons that I feel makes this film work reasonably well.",San Andreas

This is a well made & exciting Natural Disaster movie just like the old school films of the 70's & 90's with a much bigger budget & scale. Johnson makes a great lead hero again & I've loved alot of his films lately such as Rampage, Skyscraper & his Jumanji films, He's one of the greats & here he plays Rescue Helicopter pilot Ray, he's a troubled man full of regret & turmoil & he plays it fine & has to come to the rescue of his ex-wife & daughter during the huge earth shattering disaster of the San Andreas Earthquake. There's excitement, suspense & Amazing scenes of destruction & it's a huge affects heavy move but an epic effects movie that is a perfect Cinema good time or an Saturday night popcorn good time, it's just a big fun survival adventure & nothing more but that's fine as it's a wild & fun ride with Amazing scenes of destruction.

74,3xHCCH,This Roller-Coaster Was Relentless!,7,27 May 2015,"Because watching at the 4DX Theater at the Bonifacio High Street is twice the price of the usual movie, we need to decide well which films will be best seen in such an all-involving manner beyond sight and sound. The first time I decided to watch there was ""Into the Storm,"" a film that recounted the violent effects of a massive tornado in the American Midwest. Today, for my second time to watch there, it is yet another disaster movie, this time about a massive earthquake. I guess in my book, a disaster movie would be one genre of film that would work well in 4DX, and certainly this time I am not wrong.At the risk of betraying my age, I recall in my childhood that there was a famous film entitled ""Earthquake"" (1974) which was a big deal back then because it was shown in theaters with a special soundtrack effect called ""Sensurround."" My vague recollections of that movie experience was very loud and heavy bass sound effects made audiences feel like they were shaking along with the action on the screen. Of course, with one disaster film being released after another over the years, audiences would expect the new one to supersede the previous one in terms of special visual effects of mass destructiveness. ""San Andreas"" definitely does not disappoint in that aspect.Professor Lawrence Hayes (Paul Giamatti) and his team at CalTech had perfected a method of predicting earthquakes. Just when they were testing their system at the Hoover Dam, a very strong earthquake strikes. However, their equipment shows that that that Nevada earthquake was just the precursor of a bigger, more destructive as their indicators light up the whole San Andreas fault line from Los Angeles all the way to San Francisco!Meanwhile, we meet Fire and Rescue chief Ray Gaines (Dwayne Johnson) had to rescue his estranged wife Emma (Carla Gugino) trapped somewhere in LA, and then rush off by all (and I mean all -- land, sea and air) means of transportation possible to rescue their daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) trapped somewhere in San Francisco with her two new British friends who helped her, the charming architect Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) and his perky younger brother Ollie (Art Parkinson). Will Ray reach Blake in time to rescue her, or will he be reliving a past tragedy from which he had never really moved on? We all know that story is not really the big selling point of a film like this. We can all somehow predict how the family drama would go in the end, don't we? We know that Ray Gaines, being the ""Rock"" that he is, would be a super-dad who just happened to know how to do EVERYTHING. It was so good that Dwayne Johnson nailed both action and dramatic scenes with aplomb and sincerity. He provides both muscle and heart to this film. We know we will be seeing lucky characters, narrow escapes, coincidental encounters, last-minute saves, and yes, these incredible scenes are there aplenty. Oh, cheesy romantic scenes? It had those too. No, we do not really watch films like this for the story.People who watch this film are there to watch the best special effects used to recreate the most realistic disasters. ""San Andreas"" spared nothing in its span and scale of disaster. You have seen the Golden Gate Bridge destroyed in other films, but I bet you've never seen it destroyed this way before. Watching this in 3D+4DX is worth the extra ticket price because this really brings us more into the midst of the massive earthquake. Our seats are shaking with the quake, as well as the motors of the cars, planes, copters or boats we see on screen, with the wind blowing around us. It is literally breathtaking as we are taken on a relentless roller- coaster ride, with adrenaline on a constant high. Odd as it may seem, while this film fully captures the terrifying power and fearsome wrath of a massive widespread earthquake, with our hero Ray and his family to root for, this film is also becomes quite entertaining to watch as well. Director Brad Peyton was able to strike that perfect balance to keep us at the edge of our seats with the sense of imminent (and potentially real) danger, and still have an exhilarating fun time. You may also pick up some quake survival tips along the way. 7/10. With the 3D+4DX, 8/10.",San Andreas
75,pensman,A Disaster: CGI 8 / Acting -8,2,9 April 2016,"Just watched this on a 65 inch TV and I imagine on the big screen that the CGI would be even more inspiring. Most films that depend this much on green screens tend to have dark backgrounds for sets; not this one as everything is shot in bright daylight. So I give credit to those involved in all of that computer work. But the dialogue writer and acting coaches should be hiding in shame. Most films of this genre call for a willing suspension of belief but this one calls for a ""What the H E double hockey-sticks f'ing unbelievable surrender."" Once you accept that premise and just settle back to watch the Hoover Dam and San Francisco tumble down as our hero does the impossible, then you can just enjoy the architectural carnage. And of course use this as an excuse as to why you refuse to set foot in California.",San Andreas
76,aharmas,A Good Hollywood Disaster,8,30 May 2015,"Here comes the ""Rock"" avoiding all types of obstacles and dangers. Before this film is over, he has confronted every possible element on Earth, and somehow, there's hardly a scratch on him or any of his relatives. This is quite remarkable when you recall that he has flown through fire, falling debris, somehow managed to avoid being crushed by one titanic tsunami, and that doesn't include the final part of the film when he's trapped underwater. If anyone's the star of ""San Andreas"", it's not the spectacular special effects, but the endurance of this human being who will go through anything to save his relatives.Of course, his is not the typical family. He has previous trauma and tragedies of his own, before the big ""ones"" hit. Because of some personal loss and lack of communication, he is faced with divorce, but his his ties are still strong, and there's somehow room for hope in the middle of all these disasters.To start, we meet a couple of Cal Tech Scientists, who have finally figured out a way to predict the arrival of a big earthquake. They test this device near Las Vegas, only to find out the device works, very well, as the first monster earthquake strikes Hoover Dam, giving us a preview of what a multi-million dollar production can give you when armed with the latest CGI technology and some terrific sound effects. Not having enough time to catch out breath, and we have already lost a human life and some impressive modern engineering landmarks.Soon, the remaining scientist realizes that the tremor in Nevada is just a precursor of what could be one of the worst earthquakes in history.If his calculations are correct, a huge portion of California will go through drastic changes.Once the big one hits, we see entire sections of Los Angeles crumbling, disintegrating, exploding, being enveloped by fire, etc., etc. This is all backdrop for the personal drama the ""Rock"" and his family are going through. His wife is trapped in a fancy restaurant at the top of a Los Angeles building. His daughter has gone through San Francisco and will soon face some spectacular problems herself, as this other metropolis will, if it's possible endure an even worse series of catastrophes than Los Angeles, including one monster tsunami and quakes that will probably be felt in the Eastern seaboard.The audience will witness falling glass, young stars being threatened by concrete blocks, electric cables, gaping holes, and every imaginable deadly possibility our screenwriters can come up with. It gets to the point when it just becomes a little too unbelievable. It's always fun to watch some creative special effects, but we need time to recover in between showcases, and ""San Andreas"" gives you very little time to breathe. Unlike the recent ""Mad Max"" entry, this one is a bit thin and scattered all over the place. It feels like the director is not really in control of his technology and his toys. Ridley Scott and George Miller seem to be handle both technology and drama together and separately. Here we might as well be watching a kid, as he records, the disaster, and it keeps being interrupted by the obligatory and obtrusive acting interludes.One is bound to have a good time if one is willing to believe the rather impossible situations on the screen. Oh yes, we can see the impact and tragedies which occur during and after the disaster, but we also know that it couldn't all happen at the same time.",San Andreas

78,peterp-450-298716,"No doubt about it, you'll see some earthquakes. But the whole story didn't shake me up.",4,4 September 2015,"""The Earth will literally crack and you will feel it on the East Coast."" What expectations do you have when you're going to see a disaster movie such as ""San Andreas"" ? Obviously you're looking forward to see how a metropolis like San Francisco is reduced to an immense mess, strewn with rubble and twisted steel. Immense skyscrapers collapsing like a house of cards and tumbling down one after the other like domino's with lots of noise and accompanied by bombastic, swelling and ominous music. A crowd fleeing in panic. People being crushed and pulverized, thrown off buildings and bridges and the number of victims rising steadily. And all this developed in a perfect, crisp and digital way. Preferably in 3D so that you get the feeling as if everything is crashing down right in front of you. That's what you can expect in this Hollywood disaster movie and it all looks very impressive. But the accompanying story in which the personal and emotional part is mingled, really is sometimes far-fetched and trite presented. In brief you can say that the disaster part has been shown numerous times in other (older and therefore outdated) movies. And the tragic, emotional part is a subject that's dealt with in other films, but only much better.The whole story takes place at the San Andreas Fault (and that explains the logical film title). Ray (Dwayne Johnson), helicopter pilot aka rescuer, is from the outset at the forefront. A nail-biting rescue operation at the beginning of the film immediately shows what this impressive,muscled Hulk is capable of. He rescued innumerable people who were in such a precarious situation. His marriage, however, he couldn't save. A break-up between him and his wife is inevitable. A planned trip with his daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) is canceled because the Hoover Dam got destroyed by a heavy earthquake (excellent shown on the screen by the way). But she can fly with Daniel Riddick's (Ioan Gruffudd) private jet. He's the wealthy new boyfriend of her mother Emma (Carla Gugino). Of course, this trip is going to San Francisco. Coincidentally this is ""the place you shouldn't be"" at that moment because there will be a concentration of earthquakes, with disastrous consequences.How an American landscape is recreated by a succession of strong earthquakes, is the better part of this film. These are sometimes poignant, apocalyptic images that look really slick. It's breathtaking to see San Francisco's surface heaving as the ocean. But unfortunately this is not sufficient enough to turn ""San Andreas"" into a successful film. And since this is the only good part, you get the feeling as if you're just voyeuristic person who gets his kicks from watching others misery. The side story about unresolved grief, incomprehension and divorce is so predictable (so far it's the most predictable movie I've ever seen) and dull. It was so predictable that my wife and I spontaneously started a ""predict-the-next-event-or-quote 'game. And I have to be honest. My wife won as easy as pie.The characters are no more than stereotypical figures. Dwayne Johnson wasn't actually so bad. This role fitted him as a glove. On the other hand Johnson looks as if he could cause an earthquake on his own. But that this rough diamond turns into a sensitive wimp near the finish, was a bit to much (but surely predictable. One point for my wife). Gugino plays the indignant and disillusioned almost-ex-wife who immediately digs up a multi millionaire (of course. My point), although her attitude shows something different. As if she's not entirely sure about it. For the rest she just radiates helplessness and dismay. Daddario is a stunning actress with piercing Tsunami-blue eyes and a cup size that you can't look past (probably inherited from her film-mother who's also blessed with a nice set of boobs). But that's probably the most important thing why this MacGyver-like teenager was selected. She's being helped (but usually she's the one who's helping) by two boys from England, Ben and Ollie. I saw it coming from miles away that Ben and Blake would develop feelings for each other at the end (And yes, one point for me again). For me, Ollie (Art Parkinson) was the most successful and enjoyable interpretation. A smart, perky, unabashedly, funny little boy. The rest of the cast was only necessary for the story. The funniest (and shortest) interpretation was made by Kylie Minogue. A tactless bitch who gets what she deserves eventually.""San Andreas"" is a shallow-brained spectacle with some facts that are scientifically incorrect or illogical. I didn't know that you could be floating underwater with your mouth wide open without drowning and I am confident that this film broke the record of ""giving-CPR-after-awfully-long-time-with-no-brain damage-because-of-oxygen deficiency"" easily. The disaster part looked damn good and it seemed as if you could feel the shocks yourself by looking at the shaking images. The sentimental story only made shake with laughter sometimes. When are they going to replace those idiotic, clichéd one-liners and fragments with original ideas? When Johnson quoted ""Now, we rebuild"" and the American flag was raised again, I sighed again and secretly I was hoping the Richter scale registered 15.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",San Andreas

80,masonsaul,Average disaster movie,5,28 December 2018,"San Andreas is a very predictable and generic disaster movie full of all the clichés a disaster movie typically has. The CG, whilst really good for the most part, dips in quality in a few scenes. It's still enjoyable overall due to a reliably great performance from Dwayne Johnson, a good supporting performance from Paul Giamatti and the huge amount of destruction you expect from a disaster movie.",San Andreas
81,jadepietro,Bad to a Fault,4,26 October 2015,"(Rating: ☆☆ out of 4)This film is not recommended. In brief: The CGI is first rate but the film is a true disaster.GRADE: CSan Andreas is the type of movie that is a direct homage to those overwrought Irwin Allen disaster epics of the 70's, only not as much fun. Still you will laugh at the ridiculous plot and marvel at the actors' restraint and composure in delivering the unintentionally bad dialogue with the straightest of faces.Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson plays Ray, a rescue pilot whose personal life has fallen on rocky times. Separated from his wife, Emma (Carla Gugino),but still a devoted father to his savvy daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario), his life is in shambles. But a soon-to-be major earthquake is destined to send his family grappling for safety and bring this family closer together, with a new British boyfriend (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) for his daughter in the mix.￼San Andreas is the type of film where everyone talks in somber voices and speaks, no...shouts, in exclamation points saying, ""You need to get out, and I mean, now!"" or ""This is not over yet!"" or ""We're coming to get you!"" or ""Everyone, get undercover!""Reliable actors like Archie Panjabi, Ioan Gruffudd, and Paul Giamatti as the chief purveyor of doom (""California's tectonic plates are shifting and there will be bigger aftershocks. Pray for the people of San Francisco!"") are given little to do except look scared or get wet or dirty from the falling debris and giant tsunamis. Dwayne The Rock plays his leading role like a well-chiseled hunk of granite. He is more like a superhero without the colorful outfit, never resembling a real human being, but then none of the characters in Carlton Cuse's awful screenplay are written convincingly. Brad Peyton directs the film with the sole purpose of keeping the action moving and he does.￼Let's face it. The characters and their lives are merely an excuse for the actual raison d'etre of the film: the mass hysteria and destruction of many American landmarks with the latest in technical CGI wizardry filmmakers have to offer (Hoover Dam, the Hollywood sign, the Golden Gate). Fortunately the CGI upstages everything, as it should, and is really the film's only redeeming quality. The plot gets more preposterous as it forces the characters into more perilous circumstances, but the visual effects become more impressive. There is little time for the real family drama to unfold with all the collapsing skyscrapers, screaming mobs, and fiery explosions, but there will, or course, be love among the ruins in this predictable mess of a movie.As Ms. G repeated says, ""OMG!""

82,Seraphion,Too much coincidence element in a disaster movie,6,7 June 2015,"The movie really does incorporate the most common clichés of any disaster movies; dysfunctional or broken family which get reunited at the movie's end the dad called to be the hero amidst the turmoil, the hot chick or double hot chick combo, the damsel in distress, the coward who sacrifices others for his own safety who in turn meets his end, and the scientist who doesn't much. What makes this movie worse is that there's too much hyperbole in the script of how the disaster happening. This in turn translates into great display of disasters, especially here when it is combined with great CGI. But there's too much coincidence in the story that makes it so fake, like the coincidence of finding Blake, the coincidence of the tanker in the tsunami, etc. Surely he movie's great CGI and depictions of destruction is what saves it from getting a score below 6 from me. The acting overall is somehow a standard job. Even with Dwayne Johnson and Carla Gugino the drama side didn't really connect, although the action side really keeps viewers staring at the screen for quite a long time.",San Andreas
83,rgkarim,"Rock Solid Earthquake Film, but Nothing Special",7,29 May 2015,"ACTORS' PERFORMANCE: For a disaster movie you don't expect much in terms of acting outside of lots of screaming and a stone cold, brave protagonist. Surprisingly San Andreas' characters slightly deviate from that formula. Johnson is ever the stoic macho man, who seems capable of anything. He primarily keeps his cool, but for once has some tragic backstory that adds some emotional turmoil and realism to his pallet. Daddario has certainly grown up from her Percy Jackson days, and continues to impress with me with her roles. Despite looking like a shallow twenty year old, Daddario has some depth to her simple role as her character pulls out some survival skills while still be vulnerable to fear. Gugino further shows women rock, as she too jumps into the ravaged quake zones to help Johnson achieve his goals. Her character starts off moot, but eventually transitions into an action woman while also assisting in keeping the plot moving, something that can be hard to do. Paul Giamatti nails the tectonics expert role, bringing a plethora of qualities to a stereotypical role that not only ""explains"" the science involved, but also brings some purpose to the film. SCENES: San Andreas brings jaw dropping special effects to the fray, showing what a major earthquake in California could look like. The design team has done a fine job editing computer-generated sequences of buildings collapsing alongside live action sequences involving props ""falling"" on extras. Camera work adds some depth to the scenes, and for once tumbling cameras actually add to the detail of the movie, ""It's a Miracle"". Sound editing also hits home as a powerful symphony score is mixed into the rumbles, crashes, and explosions granting the feel as if this was a judgment from the heavens. In case you haven't gotten yet, this may be the best part of the movie. LIKED: San Andreas is one of the better suspense movies I've seen in a while. Most movies involve the cast making stupid choices so that we can get more suspense and thrills. This film does a decent job of piecing the events together to give a point to the adventure and putting the chaos as a secondary quality. This is helped by dividing the story into three components: detecting the quake, being in the quake, and getting into the quake zone to rescue. By balancing these three plots, I felt as if I was watching a disaster unfold, while also experiencing the horror of the city coming apart. Jumping around kept the movie entertaining, while keeping the simplistic plot moving as the three plots converge to a close. Another like is the variety of action involving stunts like aircraft piloting, debris dodging, and even skydiving all used to get to their goals. The character development was not half bad, not only adding definition to a limited role, but also helping maintain interest and emotional connections to the cast. DISLIKED: Like all disaster movies, the obvious foreshadowing in both dialog and camera-work, gives away an already predictable plot. Most likely that won't ""shake"" you up too much, but still surprise keeps things interesting. Second is the lack of buildup of the earthquake. Think about how most disaster movies start to teasing you before the storm hits, you get hyped up for what is about to come and it makes the movie more exciting. Not this one, the earthquake just hits and then bam the buildings begin to fall. In addition we could have used a little more character development to help out with the simple heroes, especially when there was so much tension at the start of the film. Conflicts kind of died down, forgiveness and acceptance happening in the blink of an eye (like that ever happens). As a side note, I wished they had done more with the Rock's team they introduced in the beginning. Some of my favorite natural disaster movies involve a crack team going into the void to save the innocents, and this one could have greatly benefited from such an element. FINAL THOUGHTS: All in all, San Andreas plays its role as a thriller, giving you some suspense, some laughs, and digital destruction in one weekend. It was better than I expected, but still lacks a lot of other qualities I like to see in a movie. One thing that most will like is the beautiful specimens on the screen and the strong heroic qualities they have that may get your fire going. Those looking for some fantastic digital work and an exciting adventure should pay a visit to the theater for this one, but otherwise stick to the home renting. My scores are: Action/Drama/Thriller: 7.5-8.0 Movie Overall: 6.5",San Andreas
84,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,Oh for crying out loud,1,14 February 2021,"Who pays to see crap like this?First of all, there's a reason we have earthquake codes. To withstand big shakers.

85,rannynm,Terrifying and Realistic,7,29 May 2015,"I like this movie a lot. It is a good disaster film. San Andreas is directed by Brad Peyton and stars Dwayne Johnson, Carla Gugino and Paul Giamatti. While this movie is well done, it doesn't quite compare with movies by the disaster movie king, Roland Emmerich. After seeing one of Brad Peyton's other movies, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, I had my doubts, but he does a pretty good job here. There are three reasons why I enjoyed this film so much. First, are the special effects. Special effects in a disaster movie can make or break it. In this film, the CGI is eye-popping. At certain moments, it feels like there is a little too much going on all at once. But at the same time, it makes you feel as if you are in an earthquake, which probably feels pretty overwhelming.The second reason I like this film is the acting. The acting is pretty strong for a disaster movie. Sometimes in disaster movies, it's all about stunts and action sequences. In this film, the acting makes you feel invested in the characters and you are really rooting for them. The last reason I like this film is the story. Though corny at times, when adding humor or romance into the big earthquake scenes, the interplay between the action scenes and the family scenes keeps you emotionally involved.There is a bit of a downside. The dialogue, characters and the some of the story are very predictable and filled with clichés. While some of the lines are clever, they often seem out of place. There are lots of pretty standard panic, action lines such as ""Run,"" ""Hold on,"" and similar. The main characters are well fleshed out, though some of the cast seems like simple stereotypes representing selfishness and greed.They spend a lot of time showing the destruction of the earth quake and less on the aftermath of the quake, such as having the main heroes trying to survive riots, gas leaks, crumbling buildings, etc. With all the devastation, it is a bit dull seeing the Golden Gate Bridge collapse for the 1000th time in a disaster flick.It is humorous that scientific accuracy is thrown out the window. For example, they say the earthquake is a 9.1 but, according to what I've read, that magnitude cannot happen on the San Andreas fault. I give San Andreas 3.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18. If you like Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Paul Giamatti and disaster movies, you'll like this one.

86,bobbysing,"A typical disaster movie with well-conceived, frightening graphics but minimum logic and emotions.",5,2 August 2016,"Beginning with a superb rescue scene of a car hanging from a cliff, SAN ANDREAS impresses a lot before it moves ahead to the terrifying earthquake hitting the city with a never before magnitude of 9.6. And from here onwards the film becomes a mixed bag with some visible merits as well as many major flaws served together to the audience loving this particular genre.To give you a better picture, if you are only interested in watching frightening graphics showcasing an entire region getting flattened by the major earthquake, brilliantly depicted by the VFX and the action director together, then SAN ANDREAS might turn out to be a fine exciting watch bringing you on to the edge of your seat repeatedly. Having a widespread destruction show to offer with excellent visuals of tremors, falling skyscrapers, blown up bridges, roads and a lot more slickly edited together, it unarguably scores much higher in this most significant (CGI) department of a disaster movie.But in case you are expecting an engrossing, realistic watch with a great mix of courage, emotions and fear then SAN ANDREAS honestly turns out to be nothing more than a technically sound, typical disaster film made on a dumb script. And the word 'dumb' is being used here since we have a whole city knocked down drastically but without any sight of thousands of people dying or bodies lying all over (as a bloodless show). Moreover here we also have the lead character of a strong, professional fire-and-rescue pilot, who simply forgets about his official duty or anybody else dying around (looking from his helicopter flying over the affected area) and is only interested in saving his two family members alone caught in one of those falling buildings like an unkind, mean human.Having said that many might not like to think about it in this logical way since the character has been really played well by the likable Dwayne Johnson along with a decent supporting cast trying hard to portray their given role convincingly. But actually that's not how we are supposed to see/visualize a tragic natural disaster with such a self-centered approach as per my personal opinion.In other words, though the film gets largely saved by its lead performance, action and graphics department put together, it's the lack of realistic/logical execution by its director Brad Peyton or the missing emotional depth in its one dimensional approach that doesn't allow you to give SAN ANDREAS any higher rating than an average film.",San Andreas
87,Matt_Layden,"""The Earth will literally crack and you will feel it on the East Coast.""",6,6 April 2016,"Where are all the ugly people? San Andreas puts a beautiful family front and centre of this disaster film and it leaves me wondering that only beautiful people can survive disaster attacks. You have a handsome well built leading man played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. You have his gorgeous wife, played by Carla Gugino and their hot hot hot daughter, played by Alexandra Daddario. Even the suave and Welsh Ioan Gruffudd has a small role here. I guess you can label Paul Giamatti as average or even below average and guess what role he's got here? The smart guy. The plot line for the film is flimsy, so much so, that there is almost no plot at all. We have a basic outline of a story where we find our characters in the location where a giant Earthquake will take lots of lives and destroy lots of buildings. Johnson plays a rescue chopper pilot, we see his skills in the opening sequences where he has to rescue a young blonde woman who's stuck in her van falling down a cliff. Our hero, front and centre, rescues the poor girl and goes back home to find divorce papers waiting for him. His family is falling apart due to a horribly tragic accident that cost him the life of one of his daughters. His other daughter is alive and well, they seem to get along, so we have no daddy issues here. Except his wife wants to move on and move on with Ioan Gruffudd. He seems like a nice guy, when circumstance don't call for him to save another persons life or anything. As soon as a character like this pops up on screen, you can almost guarantee that they will do something dickish, which will push the wife back closer to her soon to be ex husband. What does this guy do? Leave her daughter to die while she is stuck in a car. This switch was almost instant. He was likable up until that point, then he becomes a total dick to everyone. When one's life is at stake I guess....Anyways, I digress. San Andreas wants to entertain you with the abundance of special effects it throws at you. 2012 style effects which sees building collapse left, right and centre. People running through the streets, destroyed in seconds. Yet, our main characters always seem to be okay even when running on a building that is falling beneath them. Thrilling? I'm not so sure, since we've seen these scenes played over and over again in every other disaster film. San Andreas has the added bonus of looking completely fake when we have our characters dead centre in the action. Seeing both Johnson and Gugino is a boat roaming San Fransisco is hilariously awful. Nothing about this film feels genuine. The special effects look like special effects I see everywhere else. This film feels like 2012 lite. Centred around one family and their attempt to escape this destruction. The cast is serviceable to their roles, which entails a lot of screaming, running and nothing else really. I couldn't help but roll my eyes in disbelief numerous times throughout the film. Let me ask you this: Both Johnson and Gugino decide they must find their daughter amidst this chaos. So they go to San Franciso, communications are down, tens of thousands of people are dying and more are looking for salvation. Will they find each other? This is after a tsunami has hit too by the way. What are the chances that they will be wandering around looking for their daughter and she will magically appear right behind them? I think it's pretty plausible....at least this film wants me to believe so. San Andreas offers nothing new and it feels like rehashed material. I guess if you like disaster films check it out, or just watch 2012 again, it's almost the sam damn movie. At least in that one we get to see the destruction on a much bigger scale.",San Andreas

There's an excellent cast as well, led by Dwayne Johnson and Carla Gugino with good support form Alexandra Daddario, Paul Giamatti, and Hugo Johnstone-Burt. However, I hope you're not expecting any earth shattering (no pun intended) dialogue or storyline, because the filmmakers here have taken every plot cliché and hokey line of dialogue and thrown it into this movie.All in all, this film, directed by Brad Peyton, with a screenplay from Carlton Cuse, is just an escape filled with one tension packed scene after another, but don't be surprised if you find yourself unintentionally laughing out loud with some of the cheesy dialogue and plot elements.",San Andreas
89,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Predictably predictable,6,17 June 2015,"Leave your mind at the door for this one, and expect to be spoon fed clichés and an American ""happy"" Ending, because any bit of logic or cohesion quickly sinks deep into the fault, as buildings topple (yet few on the ground are shown injured) , tidal waves flood the cities, and The Rock tries to save his obligatorily estranged family from certain death. Melodramatic crap about his wife filing for divorce and already moving in with a new guy, and an under developed subplot about their dead daughter (which comes from out of nowhere and leads to nothing) mixes quite poorly with some good effects and a handful of amusing lines, while Alexandra's character and plot line was, in my mind, more interesting and more well done than The Rock's soap opera, and I'm not just saying that because she is strikingly beautiful, although that does help.The trailer included a line ""This whole chunk of land will be decimated"", which was not in the film. One supposes that is because the filmmakers realised it made no sense, as the word decimate means to kill one tenth of something. Curious, that a word exists for that. But as bad as that line is, the film's final line is even worse: after witnessing so very much death and destruction, wifey asks, "" Now what do we do?"" Someone in the audience in front of me shouted, in a bored voice ""Rebuild"", immediately before The Rock watches an American flag being raised, and proudly and triumphantly responds, ""We Rebuild"", to simultaneous audible groans, and laughter from the audience.",San Andreas
90,moviexclusive,"If you're in need for a disaster-movie fix, 'San Andreas' is a Rock-solid bet",6,26 May 2015,"'2012' marked a pinnacle of sorts for the natural disaster movie sub-genre, containing in a single picture earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis occurring across various cities at the same time. That probably explains why there hasn't been a big-budget studio movie to that effect since then till now, and also why this latest in a while feels the constant need to up the ante. Indeed, 'San Andreas' wears its ambition of being the biggest earthquake movie to date on its sleeve, but unless you haven't gotten your fix of such VFX-enhanced natural catastrophes, you probably will be left nonplussed.For the geographically challenged, the title refers to the nearly 800-mile fault line that runs through California. As seismologist Lawrence Hayes (a very grave-looking Paul Giamatti) intones at the beginning, it has been predicted that a big one will happen every 150 years, and we are already almost 100 years into the current interval. And so, as far as the science goes in this movie, a magnitude-7.1 along a previously unknown fault near the Hoover Dam will trigger a ""seismic swarm"" along the titular San Andreas fault, precipitating a magnitude-9.1 in Southern California and another even more powerful magnitude-9.6 further up north in San Francisco (for context, the 1960 magnitude-9.5 quake off Chile is the current world record holder). Amidst the toppling buildings, the human tale that emerges is one of a LAFD helicopter pilot Ray (Dwayne Johnson) who flies into downtown Los Angeles to rescue his ex-wife Emma (Carla Gugino) and then, together with Emma, into the heart of San Francisco to rescue their daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario). Instead of a multi-character narrative, veteran TV writer Carlton Cuse's screenplay focuses pretty much on Ray's solo rescue mission, albeit with some tangential cutaways to see Emma's cowardly boyfriend Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd) get his comeuppance for abandoning Blake earlier on in an underground car park. Fortunately for Emma, a dashing Brit geek named Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) whom she just meets steps up to free her, and with the latter's younger brother Ollie (Art Parkinson), the trio travel together to find higher ground to rendezvous with her parents.It's a clichéd setup no doubt, and the denouement is to be expected, but Ray's race-against-time to get to his daughter turns out surprisingly affecting. Instead of establishing every little detail upfront, Cuse's script keeps us wondering just what led to Ray's estrangement from his family, which leads to a poignant moment between Ray and Emma at the halfway mark. And instead of reprising another macho action hero role, Dwayne Johnson stays admirably grounded in the role of a father who is driven by equal parts love and grief to make sure that his child is safe. It is probably Johnson's most nuanced performance, and he gets reliable support from Gugino in their third on-screen collaboration to date.Leaving Johnson to do the emotional heavy-lifting, Brad Peyton instead concentrates on choreographing the mayhem around him. No stranger to VFX-heavy setpieces, Peyton tops his previous work in 'Cats and Dogs 2' and 'Journey 2: The Mysterious Island' with some truly jaw-dropping visual spectacle. From the fracturing of the Hoover Dam just ten minutes into the film, Peyton moves on to design the destruction of the entire Los Angeles skyline before moving on to extend the same devastation to the whole San Francisco Bay Area. It is one thing to see skyscrapers like the US Bank Tower and the Citigroup Centre falling and quite another to witness a giant tsunami send a container tanker smack into the Golden Gate Bridge, and let's just say this is probably as real as it gets next to it happening for real.Whether it was intended at the start, the choice to cast Ray as a helicopter pilot turns out to be quite the inspired one. With generous help from his cinematographer Steve Yedlin, Peyton toggles between three different perspectives from which to let his audience appreciate the scale of the disaster. There is Emma's point-of-view from someone on the ground, Ray's point-of-view from in between the toppling buildings as he tries to retrieve Emma from mid-air, and finally an even more birds-eye point-of-view of the whole earth shaking, buckling, broken, on fire, and inundated with water. The combination of these distinct points-of-view should keep audiences looking for spectacle thoroughly engaged, especially those who can't quite care more about the unfolding human drama.And yet, even though it does follow disaster-movie formula to a fault (pun intended), there is no shaking off that feeling of 'been there done that'. Yes, like we said at the start, there isn't much more any filmmaker can do to top the Armageddon wrought by Roland Emmerich in '2012', and to be sure, Peyton doesn't do that. That said, if you're looking for an earnest reminder just how unpredictable and cataclysmic Mother Nature can be, then you'll find no fault with 'San Andreas'. It doesn't get too sappy or too melodramatic, and even contains some useful PSA tips on just what to do if and when you're caught in one. It's a Rock-solid disaster movie, we'll give you that.",San Andreas
91,Luigi Di Pilla,Top special effects mixed with high suspense,8,21 November 2015,"San Andreas is on the technical level similar to the other catastrophe movie 2012. To be honest I found 2012 better than this. Anyway, give it a chance. You will spend no doubt an entertaining time. I watched it with my son and wife on DVD. Every one liked it and gave at the end a rating of 8 out of 10. The special effects came great here and are more effective on a large screen. Congratulations to all staff for this fine job. The story itself is simply told but well mixed with high suspense. The music was fantastic. Dwayne Johnson was interesting to see in this role. He delivered a respectful performance.",San Andreas
92,quincytheodore,"San Andreas does have flaws, but the bumpy ride through spectacular visual with rock solid lead proves to be an entertaining one..",6,29 May 2015,"Using the same premise from many disaster movies such as 2012 and even Volcano from years before, San Andreas delivers a more superior spectacle. However, it also copies many cliché elements. Cheesy script to build up tension and assortments of convenient plot devices are scattered through the story. This is a movie designed to entertain with over-the-top visual, and with welcomed addition of Dwayne Johnson as the lead, it succeeds in doing so.In a streak of unfortunate geological events, California is in immediate danger of massive earthquakes. Ray (Dwayne Johnson) is a pilot of rescue helicopter who must journey across the quivering land to save his family. The calamity serendipitously offers a chance of reuniting the estranged father as he proves how far he's willing to go for his wife and daughter. This theme has been done so many times, Day After Tomorrow and 2012 comes to mind. Luckily, The Rock is a demanding on-screen presence, with charisma and superhero physique, he's a good cast as the savior type.The script offers back stories, while not all of them pan out, The Rock does his best to convey his character. Another perspective is presented by Paul Giamatti as Lawrence, a professor who investigates the incoming catastrophe. He's here to deliver partially scientific explanation to the audience. Ironically, his role is quite predictable with foreshadowing comments to get the momentum rolling.Visually, San Andreas is breathtaking. Expect tons of falling buildings witnessed in extraordinary viewpoints and multiple set pieces to awe the audience. There's one particularly amazing continuous shot that follows characters as they weave back and forth as everything collapses around them. It will not disappoint those who come for high octane explosive scenes.It does have several problems like predecessors of the genre. Some of the sequences are highly implausible, most notably with the characters having plot armor and impeccable timing. Dialogues are not always charming as only few moments of the human drama are thoroughly engaging. It then eventually sets up for resolution analogy or the inspirational survival gimmick. Audience should be familiar with this method of suspending disbelief.Although the plot can be faulty, San Andreas is still a visually delightful journey. Presentably fascinating for a popcorn flick.",San Andreas
93,Terryfan,Enjoyable Movie,7,19 October 2015,I had to wait for San Andreas to come out on video so I can't judge by how it was in theaters but I'll give my review of the film.Normally disaster movies are hit and messes depending on how you would view them. San Andreas takes a different approach to the genre.The plot of the film centers around Rescue Chopper Ray (Dwayne Johnson) and his ex wife Emma (Carla Gugino) must make the most dangerous journey in the wake of a massive earthquake to find and rescue their daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario)I'll give the film writers some credit for taking original approach to the plot of the film. Also they took the time to give an actually fact about earthquakes which is not something you get in a movie action thriller like this one. The effects of this movie are mix at best that's the best way I could possibly put it they did try too hard. Some of it is wow other times you'll be scratching your head. I did enjoy some of the quotes in the movie and the writers did make the lead characters interesting with some back story to them so there is something there character wise. Is it a masterpiece? No but it is overall enjoyable and would be fun for anyone on movie nightI give San Andreas an 7 out of 10,San Andreas
94,michaeltrivedi,Ehh,5,10 September 2020,"I like Dwayne Johnson movies. They all are actually pretty good, for the most part. It's always a fun time for me at least. This one is like that I guess. It's good, perhaps even worth a watch.Give it a try5 stars",San Andreas
95,Screen_Blitz,Ultimately forgettable disaster movie,5,11 October 2015,"In this disaster flick directed by Brad Peyton, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson plays Ray Gaines, a recently divorced helicopter rescue pilot sets out to find his daughter Blake (played by Alexandra Daddario) his daughter who is caught amidst the chaos San Francisco when it becomes devastated by a massive earthquake due to strong movement in the San Andreas fault. Carla Gugino plays Emma, Ray's ex-wife who she is forced to turn to help find their daughter as she becomes trapped in the aftermath of the biggest earthquake recorded in history. This film brings out some of the most dazzling special effects of the year, but sadly, the effects cannot save this film from the disappointment it is.I watched with movie low expectations and this movie fell slightly lower. The plot is good, but nothing original or particularly exciting. When watching the trailer, the movie looked like a borderline rip-off of Roland Emmerich's 2012. While the movie fortunately doesn't turn out like this, it falls under a rather laughable script and poor dialogue. The whole subplot with Ray and his wife coping with divorce and Ray trying to reconnect with his daughter is a bit distracting and in some degree, takes away from some of the plot. A lot of the dialogue is cheesy and quite laughable. One of things the plot is missing is the emotional investment to help move the story along. The acting wasn't even great either. While Dwayne Johnson did a pretty solid for his performance, the rest of the cast could use really some improvements. The special effects, on the other hand, are fantastic. The earthquake scenes looks amazing (if exaggerated), and this is all thanks to the eye- popping special effects. During these scenes, you can almost feel the sheer intensity the characters are facing as watch buildings collapse, highways wiped out by massive floods, and roads tear open. But sadly, the special effects do very little to redeem the film. San Andreas is not terrible movie, but it isn't great either. Some may find this worth watching, but ultimately it's forgettable. It strives very little replay value and doesn't give its full potential. Overall, it is still worth watching if you are fans of disaster movies or movies with Dwayne Johnson.",San Andreas
96,Troy_Campbell,Excruciatingly dull.,3,29 May 2015,"Midway through the opening sequence I knew I was going to face an uphill battle to find enjoyment in this disaster flick. Full of limp action, woeful CGI and dialogue determined to make your ears bleed, the pre-credits scene is, sadly, indicative of the entire movie. As each set piece gets bigger and louder, yet less exciting thanks to Brad Peyton's bland direction, the narrative stupidity increases to a level that's extreme even for this inherently bombastic blockbuster genre. Not helping is the complete lack of tension despite the apparent high stakes; so dull are most of the action sequences that it becomes more fun to pick out the plethora of errors, plot-centric or otherwise. It also boggles the mind, considering the film's reported $110m budget and the fact that photo-realistic CGI has been around for years, at how the computer effects can be so poor. The ridiculously charismatic Dwayne Johnson injects energy wherever possible and Carla Gugino – sharing an unexpectedly good chemistry with Johnson – is dependably solid, whilst Ioan Gruffudd gets shafted with a laughable, about-turn role and Alexandra Daddario fails to impress. As for why thespian legend Paul Giamatti is in this at all? Well, everybody has to pay the bills. Notwithstanding the admirable efforts of a few key cast members, there's very little to praise in this over-scored, over-edited and overblown mess. Ultimately though, the biggest fault of San Andreas is being excruciatingly boring.",San Andreas

This is a catastrophe not a disaster movie. If you're thinking of The Towering Inferno or Earthquake you're in for a shock, this film makes Poseidon (2006) look like film of the year. The opening scene is irrelevant, the characterisations are awful and the excessive use of CGI, appalling. 41 years after 'Earthquake' hit the screens, and amazingly the original is still more realistic than this piece of rubbish.

It's not perfect or too realistic, but definitely one of the best ones, because of such important basic topic as natural disaster, and so much action. Just amazing to look at all that stuff looking like really happening. Deep and live experience. I am bit disappointed by unrealistic high number of death evasion, things happening too quickly, and their ability to move boat through water already filled with garbage and building pieces and dead people. Actually I expected to see more alive people while they were driving that boat. But still this is one of those extreme best movies that I will remember. High presence of effects, action, vehicles, devices, action, and bit of emotion. Motivates us to take precautions against real life natural disaster. Also reminds me of such news.",San Andreas
100,Stephen_A_Abell,A Truly Entertaining Waste Of Time.,8,4 April 2017,"This is one of those big Hollywood disaster movies that ticks every box -It's BIG - with thanks to today's computer graphics we can now total towns and cities and open up massive chasms in the earth. We can also fly helicopters through the tumbling skyscrapers and ride speedboats up the mountainous waves of tsunamis. The action and the special effects are awesome, though they do verge and teeter on the edges of ridiculousness.It's Hollywood - the only thing bigger than the effects and the disaster happening on screen is Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's aura. Not only is Johnson a physically immense man but his presence on screen is substantial and powerful. It was mainly due to this presence, humour, and physicality that I watched WWE and I was pleased to see all those essences worked well on the big screen too. As time has passed his acting skills have grown, though he doesn't have to call on them too much here as the film is action and effects driven.As with most movies of this ilk, the story is pretty limited. A family has split up for the day, going about their daily businesses and routines when the earthquake hits. Amid the ensuing catastrophe rescue pilot Raymond Gaines (Dwayne Johnson), must rescue his ex-wife and daughter. This isn't as simple as it sounds, as more buildings fall and water rises the three people have lots of obstacles to overcome before they are reunited.Director Brad Peyton does a good job of tying all the computer graphics and live action sequences together to give a thrilling and entertaining movie that is full of tension. Never did I withdraw from the movie once to think, wow isn't that a great effect; there's nothing worse than when a special effect spoils the flow of the story. That is a great testament to Peyton and the effects team.Though this is Johnson's film the rest of the cast are above average, especially Paul Giamatti who plays Dr Lawrence Hayes who is in the process of developing an earthquake premonition machine.If you like films where you can leave your brain at the door then this would definitely be one for you to watch. If you've had a rough day and need something to relax to then you could try this movie. If you love disaster films then you need to watch this.",San Andreas

Bla bla bla worst of all: he's a big-time rescue guy and when the disaster hits no one is asking him to help in the rescue efforts? He just goes after his own daughter and leaves everyone else to die? How convenient for the plot. As a superhero fan, I find any story about a hero who abandons his hero career just so he can selfishly be with his family to be abhorrently anti-heroic. A father is a normal dude, not a hero. A hero puts all the innocents first, because his ability to save them also gives him a moral imperative to actually do it. What's more important: the save the world or to save your family? Good luck with your happy family when the world has gone to hell. Sheesh.The one interesting thing I took away from this movie: Boobs. Carla Gugino = big boobs. Her daughter in the movie, Alexandra Daddario = big boobs. And she takes off more and more clothes as the movie progresses. So, watch this movie for the boobs. It's got nothing else to recommend it.

102,Richie-67-485852,It's Your Fault!,5,13 June 2015,"If you go to see this movie, getting a glimpse of what a earthquake can do remains fascinating to be sure. However, there is a disease in Hollywood that affects writers for some reason. The story comes to a point where you have to help the movie along and waive your own common sense to do it. To me, that's work and I paid to be entertained not work! Director is asleep here. What bothered me is there was so many people dying but we are supposed to care about the actors 5-6 of them getting hurt and getting help. When many are dropping like flies all around them, they not only survive but if the movie is to be believed, they should all go buy lotto tickets and retire guaranteed millionaires. Take the Director with you too. I enjoyed seeing the Rock. Just a glimpse of this guys muscle is worth something. This movie is also good for making the following point: If we ever do have a disaster, the public is virtually on their own for survival and rescue too. Too bad the earthquakes don't center on some politicians taking one for the team.. Now that would be a good movie. Skip the theater on this one.

105,petra_ste,"Crushes interest, shatters patience",5,15 December 2015,"Here's the thing: in fiction, disasters are only as compelling as the characters involved in them.San Andreas is more mediocre than flat-out awful, but the script has the raw storytelling power of the blurb on a box of cereals.The Rock is the stoic working-class alpha male, caring father and action hero, the kind of tedious protagonist who is always brave, is always right and always knows what to do next (his character introduction is an interview praising his accomplishments). I'm surprised that, in the climax, he doesn't simply pull at the San Andreas Fault and put it back in its place. Carla Gugino is the divorced wife who plans to settle down with Obviously Slimy Ioan Gruffudd. Paul Giamatti is the geologist who warns the city of the impending catastrophe before spending the rest of his short screen time crawling under a table - it's as if movie makers suddenly realized in the last stage of production: ""Oh wait, disaster movies need multiple plot lines, right? Paul, you busy?"".Not even Alexandra Daddario's turquoise eyes and luscious curves managed to resuscitate my attention.I'd suggest skipping this - it may be a 9 on the Richter magnitude scale, but as a movie it's a 5/10",San Andreas

We really didn't have anyone else in peril. If we weren't with THE ROCK, then we cut away to Paul Giamatti speaking sincerely and worriedly about the safety of those affected ""God Help Them All"" was a typical line for him. This sense of ""just okay"" also applies to the special effects of this film.

107,fernandoschiavi,"Brad eyton thinks he created a human narrative, but his work is nothing more than an inconsequential exaggeration. At east it is visually incredible, a true guilty pleasure!!",6,2 May 2021,"Cinema is art. But it is also entertainment. And anyone who appreciates experiencing in the dark room realities imaginable only in the environment of audiovisual fiction should have a lot of fun with San Andreas. One thing is for sure: This blockbuster cannot be accused of misleading propagating. The film delivers exactly what it promises: uninterrupted action and many scenes of destruction.Anyone who likes catastrophe films like Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, 2012 and Armageddon (to name one that was not directed by Roland Emmerich) has everything to like the new feature: explosions, last-minute rescues, waves engulfing cities, and a hero at risk trying at all costs to save the people he loves. Among the public, it is very difficult to find anyone who can escape the temptations to watch these productions, even though they are increasingly less memorable; that is, the end of the world is practically a collective 'guilty pleasure', that kind of production that we love to hate or vice versa.San Andreas (in the original) begins with an action scene, with an accident that triggers the rescue led by Ray (Dwayne Johnson) and his team, in Los Angeles. At the same time, scientist and professor Lawrence (Paul Giamatti) develops a module with a colleague that manages to anticipate the incidence of earthquakes. The problem is that when the module goes live, a huge earthquake was already starting to hit California. Newly separated and with a daughter about to go to college, Blake (Alexandra Daddario), Ray is surprised by the series of catastrophic events that hits the state. Using his knowledge as a firefighter, he decides to save his ex-wife (Carla Gugino). Together, the couple will travel from LA to San Francisco to rescue their daughter. At the same time, Blake struggles to survive in SF, with the help of two brothers, Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) and Ollie (Art Parkinson).The film, which capitalizes on the image of the star Dwayne Johnson, is a legitimate representative of a subgenre that was very successful in the 1970s: the catastrophe film. And as the current order of things preaches, the plot tries to be based on apparently credible scientific data to invest in the smallest of possibilities and, with that, give way to a terrible and disturbing scenario, but full of opportunities to generate moments of tension and tension. High emotional charge. That is, you throw yourself everywhere, even if at least one toe tries to stay stuck in reality.Unlike other films of the genre, Earthquake: The San Andreas Failure does not have much narrative nuclei. In addition to the study center that manages to predict the catastrophe of epic proportions that is about to start very soon, there is only the family of Ray (Johnson), a firefighter specializing in highly difficult rescues. The film itself follows the pattern of so many others, such as 2012, The Day After Tomorrow and the problem is that we have seen it all before: the family reunited by the catastrophe, new friends are made in time of need, all looking for loved ones loved ones and the action scenes have the sole purpose of making the protagonists save their own lives, powerless beyond that. No news.At the head of the cast, Dwayne Johnson is increasingly comfortable as an action movie hero and nothing seems to bother him, whether on land, at sea or in the air. Carla Gugino returns to make a good partnership with Johnson, after ""Faster"" and ""Race to Witch Mountain"". The beautiful and charismatic Alexandra Daddario, from the films of the ""Percy Jackson"" franchise and the TV series ""True Detective"", until she does well as the young lady in danger, but shrewd enough to face the problems that arise in front of hers. The British Hugo Johnstone-Burt and Art Parkinson until they do not do badly like the unexpected companions of Blake after the tragedy.Of course, patriotism is present, the ingenuity of the Americans is tirelessly pointed out as responsible for the saving of millions of lives, the flag flies intact after the disaster, things that we already expect from a film of this type. And so as not to shock the same American viewers, millions die in seconds on the big screen, but we don't see a body if we want to. Never. It is the maximum disaster in its cleanest possible form. The script by Carlton Cuse, which became famous and awarded the texts he created for the series ""Lost"", has no more creative situations and uses, without any shame, clichés seen in other films of the genre without the same shine. In a cold analysis, however, the direction of Brad Peyton, who seems to be right when it comes to destroying Los Angeles, San Francisco and part of the state of Nevada, is calamitous in relation to the dramas he tries to establish among his characters. Most of the characters are quite one-dimensional, which makes it difficult to care for them. The exceptions are the unusual trio formed by Blake, Ben and Ollie, in addition to Lawrence the earthquake expert played by Paul Giamatti, who manages to be one of the best actors in the cast, even though he is sabotaged for having to say nonsensical things.Everything is laid out in the most literal way possible, with a script (written by Carlton Cuse) out of a manual for beginners. The family photos that Ray (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) observes serve to show that he is a hero full of personal dramas and to mark the place that he and his daughter (Alexandra Daddario) will use as a meeting place later. The skyscraper under construction that the character of Ioan Gruffudd shows his stepdaughter will serve as a backdrop for the third act of the film. Nothing exists by chance, as in classic cinema, but everything is so obvious and artificial that it is difficult to accept anything in the film that is not the visual effects.Obviously, it is irrelevant to discuss the quality of the script or performances, to point out absurd facts that we will witness or to demand verisimilitude from the feature. When we set out to watch a film like San Andreas it is necessary to get rid of all this cinematic predicament, simply to let yourself go with the fun and have a complete sense of where you are getting into. The order here is escapist fun (even though the theme is completely real and scary). Seeing Los Angeles and San Francisco completely destroyed through spectacular special effects is undoubtedly a treat for the eyes. The aerial shots that show the entire cities shaking, with their ground raised, are impressive and, for the most emotional, scary. Brad Peyton's management is competent most of the time and manages to sustain one or another situation of tension - even if they really afflict only those who are most easily impressed -; after all, the famous script conveniences are there, to resolve the impasses. Like a good catastrophe film, what stands out here are the incredible scenes of destruction, created with efficient special effects, which are even more highlighted in 3-D. For the genre.Brad Peyton's direction, from the not-so-memorable "" Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore"" and ""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island"" (also starring Johnson) is just right, although it manages to have a good moment of suspense in a scene where Ray tries to carry out a rescue and we don't know if he was successful until the last moment. But he lacks a little more of a firm pulse to make the action sequences more exciting and dramatic. Peyton struggles to generate tension and rarely makes the viewer feel anything for the protagonists. Long moments of disposable dialogue make the film even more dull and all we want is for the earth to shake again to liven things up a little.Regardless of the clichés that were already expected, a major problem with this Earthquake is its speed. The film seems to engage in the franchise of the protagonist and goes fast and furious for just about everything. There is no atmosphere, preparation or suspense for characters or situations. Well, if someone tells you that they feel that something bad is going to happen, the next scene will happen as quickly as possible; if someone announces the fall of a dam, the dam falls unceremoniously in 30 seconds; if anyone senses the danger ... it's over, the scene is over. There is no way to cheer, get tense or get excited about a film that is not only full of common places, but also prevents the viewer from having such cheap emotions that any copy of the genre has.Designed for the conservative / patriotic US audience, the film does not work entirely outside its niche. Peyton thinks he created a human narrative, but his work is nothing more than an inconsequential exaggeration, both in the family drama involving the family destroyed by a tragedy that affected everyone and by the excess of scenes of destruction. In fact, there are so many scenes of destruction that it lessens the impact on the viewer, in the best style of any film in the Transformers saga. It is such an earthquake that in the end it becomes trivialized and repetitive. San Andreas, in the end, is the same as all the catastrophe films you have ever seen in your life: it has the same characters, the same twists, the same situations. But we don't care. We like it. When it happens to still have a charismatic cast headed by The Rock, then it gets even more fun. Earthquake easily enters the hall of catastrophe films that deserve a huge screen, image in very high definition and sound at maximum volume.",San Andreas
108,MihaiSorinToma,"An ordinary ""disaster"" movie",5,27 August 2017,"After a massive earthquake which almost shatters California, a rescue helicopter pilot finds himself in the terrible position of saving both his wife and his daughter from the debris. As nature seems to have yet another shake in store for the people, he must act quick in order not to repeat an event from the past which marked his life ever since.It's one of those movies which has prepared a massive cataclysm for people to endure while focusing on a couple of characters and their fate throughout the fatidical moments. It simply impresses and amazes with its visual effects and CGI, but manages to be below par in every other aspect which is more or less movie related. Besides the fact that the pilot ditches any work related service and uses the work helicopter to save only his family, the main characters seem to have some kind of supernatural powers, those of high endurance to crashes, hits and wounding in general. It get it, it is supposed to be exaggerated, otherwise the movie wouldn't have existed, but it takes this exaggeration aspect to a mind boggling and even logic insulting level, thus spoiling the satisfaction which could have been provided afterwards. I honestly think that you can do it without having such unbelievable events which simply do not bring anything good (maybe irony), because we're not talking about a super-hero movie here.The main characters, on which the whole story focuses, aren't very sympathetic, creating little care from the viewer as far as their fate is concerned. Anyway, being as predictable as this movie is, you won't even think that something bad could happen to them, thus little worries here. I did enjoy some of the actors' performance though. The dialog also has a very important role, but not through its complexity or intelligence, but through its simplicity and complete lack of imagination, almost every line being composed of two or three words or something really obvious which simply stalls the action without any reason. The plot is overall simplistic and linear, managing to be have a complete lack of drama, or at least of drama which can be transmitted to the viewer. If you consider a drama only the fact that a quake struck a highly populated area (of course, movie-wise speaking; in real life of course it would be a massive drama) then it is highly dramatic. If you're looking for drama as far as the main characters are concerned, then you're completely out of luck.As an overall impression, it's just another ""disaster"" movie which has, as most of them, very impressive visuals, but fails in terms of logic, story-telling, characters or even plot. To be honest, I didn't have high expectations regarding it and I saw it just for the visuals which didn't let me down. If you're looking for anything else, you'll have to search elsewhere.",San Andreas
109,Rob-O-Cop,Big Dumb America,5,26 August 2015,"Hilariously dumb and manipulative, it's entertaining on that level alone, although scary in that it's so boarder line that you can't be sure the movie was made with tongue anywhere near cheek, I'm inclined to think not. That this movie is serious, that America needs to feel like a scared kitten rescued by a big stack of muscles. That stack of muscles is Dwayne Johnson and it's hard not to love him. He's kinda good in this, I like him, even when he's part of this manipulative propaganda. The special effects were nice. It kinda flowed, sort of, I guess, lots of plot holes but why bother looking for them when the iq level they're aiming this at is so low you're not supposed to notice. The cheesy flag at the end gives you another good piece of cheese to choke on. If we're going to go down we might as well go down stupid.",San Andreas
110,jrarichards,By no means as weak as you might expect,8,26 January 2017,"Let us first acknowledge that those electing to watch a disaster movie do so for certain pretty obvious reasons. So no comparing chalk with cheese. There are quite a few over-lucky coincidences in ""San Andreas"", and a certain number of geological, oceanographic, architectural or scientific implausibilities, but then again one does not watch this kind of film to see real life (and if we want to see terrifyingly real-life images of disasters natural and manmade, we can certainly now do so). Indeed, the makers of ""San Andreas"" (from Canadian Director Brad Peyton onwards) have obviously looked quite carefully at the shocking footage of the two recent large-scale tsunamis (if failing to note that the water does GO BACK AGAIN before too long!), as well as 9/11, and to me the flavour of that they inject into the film is realistic enough.Obviously, the special effects in general make or break a film like this, and - again to my mind - ""San Andreas"" avoids the first and worst trap of useless or cheap effects, while also avoiding the trickier CGI-era trap (heavily fallen into by the new ""Independence Day"", for example) of making the death and destruction look throwaway, wholesale, somehow ""impressionistic"" and therefore inclined to leave the viewer cold. Here, the scale is vast and the ideas for the chaos and catastrophe really pretty innovative, but we are also kept in touch with the fate of real people, who are sometimes at least left with tiny choices about how they can act (notwithstanding some quite-impressive and shocking presentations of instant deaths from large chunks of falling masonry and so on). Ultimately then, I like the way this is done, and would suggest these effects leave this film high up on the list of quality disaster movies.The characters who operate against the catastrophic background must also be a bit crucial to a film of this kind, and here they are enjoyably resourceful, with professions, backgrounds or experiences that have given them a far-above-average capacity to manage when everything collapses. The muscle-bound Dwayne Johnson playing fireman-cum-helicopter rescue guy Ray Gaines does well enough, and the rest of his (surviving) family consists of a beautiful (if estranged) wife played by Carla Gugino, and a beautiful and gutsy (and above all kind) daughter played by Alexandra Daddario. Sweetly enough the latter meets up with younger and older brothers from England played respectively by Art Parkinson (Irish) and Hugo Johnstone-Burt (Scots-born Australian). This leaves us with minor accent problems, but ""the lads"" end up coming across pretty well, in part also because the older brother is trained in engineering (conveniently), while the younger is no slouch in the intellect department, and reasonably charming with it. This group gels surprisingly well, enough for us to see them as more than cardboard cutouts, and enough (I feel) for us to to get wrapped up in their fates...The main other players are Caltech scientists, notably Dr Lawrence Hayes (played by the ever-likable Paul Giamatti). Marissa Neitling has a welcome bit-part in there, Alec Utgoff and Will Yun Lee slightly more major roles, but as a team they look OK, and all the more so when joined by a journalist played by Archie Panjabi. While none but the Doc have that much to do here, there is both a degree of plausibility and sufficient reason for sympathy from the viewer.There's also Kylie (Minogue) in a tiny cameo role (plus), and Ioan Gruffudd as a bad guy (though this time - FOR ONCE - a bad guy played by someone who has dropped his native British accent for an American one). Many thanks for this great step forward, Brad! (All the more so given that the British accents we do have here are among the heroes). More points also for the fact that this is a bad guy who leaves the daughter character to her fate, but also ends up saving her, albeit indirectly. That's a touch of nuance I appreciated, and it's not quite the only one. Thanks to this film, I learned a lot more about a San Francisco landmark which I must go and see one day (having never heard of before) called the Coit Tower. This is not a purely chance inclusion in the film (as those who read up on it will see), and it's nice to see that someone knows their Frisco a bit.Clearly some more things were done right in this film, as I found myself genuinely moved I believe three or four times, and not surprisingly also during the final scene (which is of a kind I personally have always been a sucker for). So then, quite against expectations, I ended up having an enjoyable time with this film, which came over as some kind of cohesive and pretty impressive piece of work. These days, this is not as easy as it sounds with a (reasonably) big budget and CGI-based offering of this kind, but I was won over successfully.",San Andreas
111,bob-the-movie-man,A Fault without stars,5,6 June 2015,"In recent years Roland Emmerich has been the king of destruction on a worldwide scale with films like ""The Day After Tomorrow"", ""2012"" and ""Independence Day"" (now – bizarrely and to my view unwisely – with two sequels on the roadmap). This time though, with ""San Andreas"", it is Brad Peyton who takes the helm in a mass orgy of destruction on the US west coast.Dwayne (""The Rock"") Johnson plays Ray, a Fire & Rescue helicopter pilot whose skill and coolness are illustrated through a daring opening rescue.But despite the joy received from rescuing stupid people from perilous situations, Ray's life isn't all a bed of roses. For reasons of past tragedy, he is separating from his wife (Carla Gugino) and to rub salt into the wound her new beau – architect Daniel Riddick (Ioan Gruffudd) – has the temerity to step into his fatherly role of transporting his daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) to college in San Francisco.Meanwhile the excellent Paul Giamatti plays an expert seismologist who, with just astonishing – and some might say unbelievable – timing, discovers the Holy Grail for detecting earthquakes the very moment that a severe earthquake rocks Nevada! But that is just the start of the problems as the whole of the San Andreas fault opens up and disaster looms for the whole Western seaboard with – you've guessed it – San Francisco forecast to bear the brunt of the devastation. The scene is set for Ray to pursue a desperate mission to save his family.There is a major fault in this movie, as reflected in the title. Unfortunately, that is not the only fault visible.The early seventies were the golden age for the disaster movie genre, led by producer Irwin Allen with the classic ""The Poseidon Adventure"" in 1972 and ""The Towering Inferno"" two years later. I was pre-teen at the time and just adored these films. Where they worked so well (for the better ones anyway) was in putting a completely disparate group of people together, each with their own back-story, secrets and sins, and watching the drama play out as the disaster involving capsize/fire/earthquake/meteor/killer bees (delete as applicable) proceeded. What ""San Andreas"" visibly lacks is this sense of 'will they/won't they' (die that is), since there are so few main characters available to be potentially bumped off. Granted that young Blake, with her true hotness amply illustrated through an early gratuitous poolside scene, picks up a prospective boyfriend and his younger brother in San Francisco to up the potential body count. However you know that the arc of the story, and the likely prospect of a 'Hollywood ending', is bound to limit the carnage. And this effectively pours a tsunami worth of cold water onto the tension.The other major problem I had was with the 3D. I'm not a great fan, but had to admit that the effects used in the opening scenes of the film were pretty good and added to the excitement. However 3D effects always leave me feeling that the action seems – ironically – LESS real than in 2D, and this really strikes home when the wall-to-wall CGI of mass destruction arrives. To me it just looks insanely false, as typified in an early scene (no spoiler) involving lots and lots of water. It would actually be interesting to see a 2D cut to see whether it was the CGI that was bad or just the CGI in 3D.Dwayne Johnson, although not having the most dynamic of dialogue to deliver, actually does a creditable acting job. Most of the rest of the cast seem to be sleepwalking through their roles, including a strangely irrelevant cameo from Kylie Minogue. Will Yun Lee is good as Giamatti's brilliant young colleague. But the British actress Archie Panjabi (excellent as Kalinda from ""The Good Wife"") seems to be completely wasted in a nothingness role of a TV news reporter. All in all, the earth didn't move for me with this flick.(If you enjoyed this review please see the illustrated version - with comedy captions! - at bob-the-movie-man.com and sign up to receive future posts.

112,AngelHonesty,Good disaster movie,7,21 December 2019,"The show did well depicting the aftermath of a large earthquake in the US. I find the graphics are very well done, so is the filming and storyline. It does have more of a fun feel to the movie then a deep series one. The only thing that really brought this movie down from being a great film, was the acting. Carla Gugino and Dwayne Johnson were terrible choices for this film. They have no chemistry and Dwayne Johnson is all muscle, nothing heartfelt or deep about his acting. The only belivable actress is Alexandrea Daddario",San Andreas
113,bryank-04844,"'San Andreas' is perfect in all the right places, cheese and all.",7,27 July 2015,"It's certainly been a while since we got to sit through an epic disaster film that featured earthquakes, volcanoes, twisters, a giant monster lizard, or even a 'Sharknado'. Luckily for us, the summer of 2015 has given us 'San Andreas', a full- scale earthquake action picture starring Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. It shouldn't be any surprise that director Brad Peyton has teamed up with The Rock again for this disaster flick since their previous 'Journey 2: The Mysterious Island' did so well. Add on 'Lost' writer Carlton Cuse, and you have 'San Andreas', the movie that should be able to hold the championship belt at the box office, at least for a week or two.It was definitely a missed opportunity to not title this film 'The Rock v. Earthquakes', even if it didn't feature our main hero jumping solo out of an airplane and giving the natural disaster his iconic 'People's Elbow', while yelling ""If you smell what the Rock is cooking"", but I digress. What I like most about 'San Andreas' is that it knows exactly what kind of movie it wants to be and commits one billion percent to it. It knows that it wants to be full of action and peril with at least three sides of cheese, complete with funny one liners, fast close up pans of The Rock looking at the destruction, and even wind blown American flag hanging ever so slightly on the damaged rubble.So, if you're going to follow anyone in a massive earthquake type scenario, it might as well be The Rock, who plays Ray, a retired war pilot turned helicopter search and rescue pilot in Los Angles, as we see in the first scene of the film that strongly resembles the first few minutes of 'Cliffhanger'. Ray is the epitome of the good guy badass who can rescue and save anyone with a smile on his face, tell a quick joke to make you feel more comfortable, and probably fight three bears with chainsaw hands by himself. This didn't work at home though as his soon-to-be-ex-wife Emma (Carla Gugnio) wants a divorce and has moved in with her extremely wealthy land developer boyfriend Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd).Emma and Ray have an 18 year-old daughter by the name of Blake (Alexandra Daddario, the beautiful mistress of Woody Harrelson from HBO's 'True Detective'), who takes a ride with Daniel on his private plane where she meets Ben (Hugo Johnston-Burt), who is applying for a job with Daniel. Ben's kid brother Ollie (Art Parkinson) is the smooth talking comedic relief of the film and is along for the ride through the earthquake too. Meanwhile, a seismologist (Paul Giamatti) at CalTech learns of a string of mini quakes around Las Vegas, when the big one hits, taking out a major landmark.He soon realizes this is the pre-cursor for the mighty big one to tear about the San Andreas fault, which happens soon after. Ray is summoned to start rescuing in his helicopter when the big one hits and goes rogue to rescue his ex wife on top of a building, then off to find and save their daughter in another city. Most of the film is spent dodging falling buildings, avoiding sink holes, and a big typhoon as the split family tries to find each other. This is also a great way for Ray and Emma to work on their failed marriage, possibly due to an underused and ridiculous backstory.That being said, 'San Andreas' plays out quite well, with plenty of moments that will guarantee you to move to the edge of your seat and your jaw to drop. It just seems like the earthquake is strictly after Ray and his family from time to time, as they can't seem to catch a break from certain doom. The Rock handles the big guy hero with ease and even has a few shots of delivering some hilariously cheesy lines with big musical crescendos.Daddario and Gugino turn in excellent performances as well, as they are more or less put through the ringer more than a dozen times. Second to The Rock smacking the earthquake in the face, the visual effects are all top notch. I know we've seen tons of buildings completely fall due to certain Marvel superheroes recently, and we certainly get that here, but it's the smaller moments that stick with us for longer, whether it be kitchen appliances exploding in a restaurant and setting people on fire, or window glass falling on people from several hundred feet up and slicing and dicing them. That detail was good to see here.In the end, 'San Andreas' won't be up for Best Picture at the Oscars, but it certainly nails this niche genre to a tee with all of it's impressive action and performances, even if it has enough cheese for a baker's dozen grilled cheese sandwiches. Highly Recommended!",San Andreas
114,lopezpatricia-06139,A REAL SATURDAY AFTERNOON CGI STINKER,1,21 June 2020,"What an insult to anyone with a brain. Every scene is super predictable. Every single line is cheesy.

115,Seth_Rogue_One,When you have 110 million dollars in your budget you can get awesome effects!,6,10 October 2015,"Unfortunately that seem to be pretty much the only thing you can get.You can't make paper-thin characters with dialogue containing so much cheese that the movie could end up with you gaining weight from watching it alone any more fleshed out and a script that's so predictable that even a person with dementia can follow it and see how it's all gonna play out with no problems any more unpredictable.The acting is acceptable at best, Carla Cugino tries raising the acting- bar a bit here and there but overall yeah not that great.Although he has great charisma and a likability factor to him that can't be denied I think that maybe Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson should invest in some acting classes, but perhaps it's just the director who failed to direct him properly and was too focused on making the movie look good instead.And don't get me wrong it does look good, the effects are really good and without them this could very well been a complete disaster (pun intended).I give it a 5.5/10 though, cause it does deliver when it comes to the disaster action and if you're a disaster-film buff you'll probably find a reasonable amount of enjoyment in it, and it was borderline passable time for me as well (when I wasn't cringing over the acting or the cheesy dialogue).",San Andreas

117,virek213,"Whose ""Fault"" Is It Anyway? SAN ANDREAS",8,5 June 2015,"It has been known for decades that, of all the major cities in the United States that are vulnerable to massive earthquakes, both Los Angeles and San Francisco rank at the very top. Not only are there many fault lines running underneath each city and its outlying metropolitan areas, but there's also what is arguably the most notorious fault line on the planet, the dreaded San Andreas Fault. Scientists have said that a major quake usually occurs along this fault line every one hundred fifty years; and in the year 2015, that time is severely overdue; and while there have been significant quakes in that period, they've occurred on rift zones other than the 800 mile-long San Andreas, which runs all the way from Eureka southeast to the Mexican border. But in the 2015 sci-fi/disaster opus SAN ANDREAS, California's time has run out.Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson portrays an L.A. Fire Department chopper pilot who is expert at saving people's lives, but who wasn't able to save one of his daughters during a whitewater rafting trip that turned tragic; and soon his life is turned upside down when his wife (Carla Gugino) serves him with divorce papers. In the meantime, over at the seismological lab at Caltech in Pasadena, the school's chief seismologist (Paul Giamatti) has detected ground pulses in southern Nevada, which unfortunately start a chain of horrific ground events, beginning with a massive quake destroying Hoover Dam. Yet this is only the beginning; to him, it indicates a possible chain reaction on the San Andreas Fault Zone on the 400-mile stretch between L.A. and San Francisco. Sure enough, his predictions come true with extreme consequences, as all of California is hit with a swarm of quakes in the 7.5 to 9.5 magnitude range along the infamous fault line, with Los Angeles and its surrounding environs being hit first. Johnson is thus forced into action to rescue Gugino from a crumbling high rise in Downtown Los Angeles; and with the knowledge that his only surviving daughter (Alexandra Daddrio) is up in San Francisco, he and Gugino must outrace the continuous destruction, and some hair-raising events (including having to parachute from a plummeting aircraft into San Francisco's AT&T Ballpark; plus a gigantic tsunami that swamps the City by the Bay), to get her.Without question, like a lot of Hollywood blockbusters that rely so heavily on CGI, SAN ANDREAS suffers at times from plausibility issues, as real-life Caltech seismologists Lucy Jones and Kate Hutton pointed out. There is only minimal scientific evidence that ground pulses of the type mentioned here could trigger seismic events on any other fault lines, let alone a monstrous catastrophe along the San Andreas Rift Zone. Still, in terms of certain important rescue and destruction scenarios, like many older buildings collapsing with nightmarish results, SAN ANDREAS does things right, especially with the presence of Johnson playing an Everyman type of hero.Though it shares its scenario with two other important films of this type (1974's EARTHQUAKE, and the 1990 made-for-TV film THE BIG ONE: THE GREAT LOS ANGELES EARTHQUAKE), SAN ANDREAS also borrows liberally from more recent high-octane sci-fi/disaster films like 1998's DEEP IMPACT, 2004's THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, and, perhaps most especially, the 2009 end-of-the world spectacle ""2012."" But while director Brad Peyton is not in the human-interest category of a Steven Spielberg, he is still able to get the best out of his six main cast members, who are not stereotypical cardboard clichés, even with a script and storyline with plausibility problems. Several moments in the film, like the rescue of Daddrio from a San Francisco high rise swamped by the tsunami, are quite frightening. In the end, SAN ANDREAS, whatever gaps there are between illusion and reality, does serve up the goods in true Hollywood fashion. But it also warns that the people in both Los Angeles and San Francisco are at risk from The Big One now more than ever before. For those reasons, I am willing to forgive its occasional lapses and give it a respectable '8' rating.",San Andreas

In a way, I am both.Sometimes one is hungry and wants a burger at BK to fill the stomach and appease the hunger. If you do so, you know that it is not good meat or a good burger, and that the BK outlet it is not a proper restaurant. You don't go there fooling yourself right? But you still go in, grab your cheap burger, eat it and enjoy it.Well, when one decides to watch a movie like San Andreas is the same, with all respect. I mean, didn't you knew how was going to be in advance or what you were going to find? It doesn't matter that the acting is not good or the the characters believable, it doesn't matter that the situations are ridiculously impossible and we already know the end, it doesn't matter that the hero seems supra-human and he is the only clever guy in the whole planet. Nothing really matters, because you will spend two hours watching the Rock and imagining a cataclysm of planetary proportions that we all humans fancy fearing and overcoming for whatever reason our subconscious has decided that is OK to fancy. We we'll delight at that god of a man called The Rock, because he is the sexiest man alive and has muscles that seem created to save the world, or at least me. He is the rescue-me-hero of my fantasies for sure.I watched this movie on a plane, as part of the entertainment program, and I thought it was the right price :) but I was entertained.

An overwhelming saga of a state devastated by monstrous earthquakes, resulting in stunning vistas of unprecedented destruction so vast that they are difficult to emotionally process. Technically, there is no doubt this is a brilliantly made and directed movie. However, it is the human element that creates the tension and suspense as characters for whom we care struggle for survival against a panorama of immense ruin. Carla Gugino shines as the wife of Dwayne Johnson, giving a moving performance of tremendous power as a woman desperate to save her family. Gugino lights up every scene in which she appears and the camera loves her. Johnson does well in his part as a helicopter pilot and first responder who faces the greatest challenge of his professional and personal life.

Surprisingly to me, Johnson was pretty good, although he played a character who was virtually a sort of superhero. Daddario and Johnstone-Burt (both decent eye candy) also played their roles well. Parkinson also did a good job as Ollie, Ben's engaging and precocious younger brother. There is a bit of sentimentality and gratuitous flag-waving at the end that I suppose are realistic enough but were a little over the top.Really, you would go to this movie to see the disaster scenes, which are monumental, as one expects from disaster movies nowadays.

Similar as in not much plot/story (if any) but huge on visuals. Now, obviously the visuals have become bigger and more impressive since Volcano, but it seems that story writing for these films hasn't because San Andreas is just another disaster movie where the popcorn comes out and the brain power gets switched off.This is really just another stereotypical Hollywood Action movie where the makers will go do pretty much anything - including going against professional advice they brought in - just to make a film look good. For instance, an earthquake hitting San Francisco would not, in turn, cause a massive tsunami to hit San Francisco. I know this film is as far from true life as you can get, but still, to ignore such a factual error is pretty bad. But with San Andreas you get what you pay for...massive on effects, action, & unbelievability but paper thin on plot & story.You know what you're getting into with a movie like this (if you don't then you're pretty naive), and I've watched movies of a similar vein that I've actually quite enjoyed (Day After Tomorrow being one), but even with all the amazing effects (and they really are well done here) and action, San Andreas still only produced a ""meh..it was OK"" reaction from me.The rating I've given this movie is purely because of the CGI and the action, because let's face it - there's not much else here to help boost the rating, including the acting. I mean it's not bad, but there wasn't really any stand-out performances, including Johnson's and I think this is another example of his limitations as an actor. In fact, I think the only thing that stood out best was Alexandra Daddario's chest, so at least the male teenage audience will be happy.If you enjoy films where action, CGI, cliché's, and predictability totally eclipse story & plot then you'll probably enjoy San Andreas.",San Andreas
124,nicholls_les,"It's just a movie, I enjoyed it!",8,19 November 2018,"Most of the criticism of this movie seem to be by people who expected this to be a high end drama or Shakespeare ( not that I like Shakespeare, I find most of it boring) but this is a simple disaster movie not meant to be taken too seriously.
On that basis, it isn't half bad!
I agree there are plot holes and many scenes are pretty unbelievable but so what! It's just a movie.",San Andreas
125,brett-76260,Yeah not so good,3,16 October 2021,Did you ever see the movie Dante's Peak??? If you have them there is no need to watch this one... basically the same movie. I mean it's not horrible but it is kind of a turd. Now the CGI??? Yeah that's horrible. Some of the CGI is pure cringe and extremely cheesy. This won't be the worst movie you ever seen but it is certainly one of the Rocks lower end flicks. It's a one and done that's for sure.,San Andreas
126,DareDevilKid,"You'll Have a Blast while Watching it, and then Forget it Almost Instantly",7,23 June 2015,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 3.3/5 starsThe allure of ""San Andreas"" rests entirely on the caliber of its pandemonium, cutting-edge special effects, and the charisma of its leading man - on these three counts alone the movie is more than worth the price of admission. Complain all you want about the plot contrivances, plot-holes, and flaws in the narrative, but the film is ultimately critic-proof for its sheer entertainment value, and even the most cynical will have to admit that it more than delivers what you bought your ticket to see.As disaster-action films go, this one isn't in proximity to the caliber of ""Towering Inferno"", ""Dante's Peak"", ""2012"", and ""Into the Storm""; perhaps because the mayhem looks too artificial after a point of time, and also because some of the CGI wizardry comes across as preposterous - the kind that doesn't make you gape in awe but rather remain dumbfounded at the absurdity of the whole situation. I mean, they should have stopped short of having The Rock ride a bloody tsunami on a speedboat. Still, that same tsunami is the reason why we see a cruise ship rolling through California's Chinatown section, so I guess that offers enough compensation for the aforementioned inanity. Nevertheless, ""San Andreas"" is a terrific entry in the genre's popcorn blockbuster category, brimming over with close-calls, near misses, and unbridled fun.The film also benefits from some solid performances. Carla Gugino, Alexandra Daddario, and Hugo Johnstone-Burt are easy on the eye, Paul Giamatti is a veteran performer, and Dwayne Johnson brings as much charisma and star appeal as he ever has, proving once and for all that he has the chops to guarantee a grand opening for a non- franchise, non-comic-book, solo vehicle (the movie is doing rollicking business at both the U.S. and international box-office). The script is obviously predictable, but it takes little time to set up the characters and offer them some back story, too (nothing original but a pleasant surprise indeed). And when a foolish woman (Gugino) wants to divorce the world's manliest man at the moment (Johnson) in favor of a cowardly architect/business tycoon (Ioan Gruffudd) who builds wobbly skyscrapers that rudely scrape the heavens, you just know that the Gods would get infuriated enough sooner or later to smite her entire home state from top to bottom. At the end of it all, ""San Andreas"" is great fun surrounded by clichés, and cheesy in all the right ways.",San Andreas
127,davidgee,Grandmother of all disasters,8,2 June 2015,"Let's be honest, people. What we want from a disaster movie is to see lots of buildings collapsing, dams bursting, a tsunami pouring through city streets and (let's not deny it) casualties in the high thousands. Well, if that's what we want, that's what SAN ANDREAS delivers. And how!Okay, the family-in-peril is the grandmother of all disaster-movie story lines, and Dwayne Johnson is not the most charismatic actor on screen (and just how charismatic was Charlton Heston in EARTHQUAKE or Sylvester Stallone in DAYLIGHT?), but SAN ANDREAS wisely centres on this one family and one don't-say-I-didn't-warn-you earthquake expert (Paul Giamatti). EARTHQUAKE had far too many back stories. SAN ANDREAS does not test our patience: the 'quake goes on and on and on: building after building crumbling onto street after street.The script shamelessly borrows from a whole bunch of previous disaster movies, but the sheer pace and the stunning CGI make this as thrilling a movie as we are likely to see until ... JURASSIC PARK returns (not long to wait)",San Andreas
128,beresfordjd,It is what it is.,8,28 March 2016,"This is a movie - it is not real life, the people in it are not real. It is a disaster movie, a story. It has all the elements that movies like this have. The only thing is that it is reasonable entertainment, a popcorn movie. The special effects are good and quite convincing. The young kid is incredibly irritating as they always are in these things and people ,like the daughter, get into life threatening situations without actually getting hurt while all around them (the extras) are being blown away left , right and centre. It is enjoyable fluff and one should not bring to it the same critical examination that you might watch The Godfather with. The Rock is the main character and does not do too bad a job with it as does the rest of the cast. Kylie Minogue's part is all too brief, unfortunately. It does make one wonder that if there were such a catastrophic event how would the country ever cope with so much death and destruction?",San Andreas
129,mjsreg,A stunningly awful film with brilliant special effects,2,30 June 2016,"The only reason I gave this film any stars at all is purely because of the special effects.Other than that the story is sickeningly predictable and shallow.If you like the usual formula for American 'feel good' movies then you will probably love this, even with it's illogical and downright stupid action sequences.The characters are the usual cardboard cut-outs indicative of these films. Stereotypical 'hero', along with stereotypical 'babe', 'clever child', and the most awful portrayal of someone British on film I have seen since Hugh Grant and Colin Firth - and they are both truly the most awful of awful. Even if you watch this film for a bit of no-brainer fun you will cringe numerous times, and be left wondering if a film could become any worse.The only decent bit of acting comes from Kylie Minogue who has an all to short part.",San Andreas

The movie is a little terrifying than other disaster movies like 2012 or the day after tomorrow. I don't know much about Earthquakes but the science laid out in the movie is sound, and it plays on real events that have happen in the past ten years that make the movie seem accurate (to some one who lives in an earthquake free zone at least), than other end of the world situations. I can only imagined how much more crazier it would be if I was from San Fran watching the city get totaled. Like most disaster movies it has an ensemble cast with Paul Giamtti as head of the team that figures out how to predict the quakes, Alexandra Daddario as The Rock's sexy and strong (white) daughter, and the always beautiful Carl Gugino once again playing Johnson's love interest slash sidekick like she did in Race to Witch Moutian and Faster.

It is in many ways a very convincing plot that builds up and that is actually the best part of the movie, what is going on doesn't seem to be that unbelievable, it could kind of happen it the right or wrong circumstances occurred.The rest of the film is action packed, trying to escape, trying to rescue and help etc. etc. seeing that some people are good and some are not so good, maybe even evil and see what happens to the good ones and the bad ones, very classic.",San Andreas
134,MattBrady099,Enjoyable action flick,5,30 May 2015,"San Andreas is today's vision of The Day After Tomorrow, Deep Impact and 2012 but a lot more fun.The story San Andreas is about a massive earthquake rocks California, a rescue chopper pilot will stop at nothing to find and save his estranged daughter.So I just San Andreas and I had a lot of fun watching it, it's not a amazing movie if I'm looking at it closely and yes the movie dose have it's flaws, but really what was I expecting from this movie? well I was expecting Dwayne Johnson character saying really cheesy one liners that are bad but funny. Big CGI environment, dramatic music from every disaster movie out in the 90's and everyone being dead serious. And I got some of that but not that the cheesy one liners which I'm glad it's not in the movie.Who every says that Dwayne The Rock Johnson can't act...you are right but this guy has been acting for a while now and it's getting pretty old saying he's acting wooden, same with Arnold Schwarenegger he's been performing for almost 40 years now and everybody just accepted his acting as I think everybody knew it got old after a while saying the same thing. Both have something in common, both can't act but at least they both have that likability to them that every time they on screen I'm happy to see them, because they both really likable in real life. Dwayne Johnson in this movie pulled off a action hero very well and at least he had fun with the role and he didn't take it way way too seriously.Now it comes to disaster movies you got to have good visual effect's and for the most part this movie did have good effect's. It really helped to set the scale of a big disaster and it give the action scenes that solid concrete impact that a movie like this needed.Now for problems: When I said some of the CG was good, well there was some noticeable and fake looking CG at times. The opening of the movie which involves a car crashing and hanging off a deep hole in the background. Some of the effect's worked and some didn't.The character's in the movie are so freaking retard and I don't mean Dwayne Johnson, Paul Giamatti and Carla Gugino character's, I mean the supporting character's. This isn't really a spoiler for the movie but these a scene where Dwayne Johnson daughter played by Alexandra Daddario, she's stuck in the middle of this disaster and then she finds out about a tsunami that's on it's way due to all of the earthquake's, and what does she do? goes into a unfinished building that's not even close to done and she thinks that would save her from the tsunami, nope the building couldn't hold the power of a giant freaking waving that's more power then other wave (The movie made that point out about the tsunami and earthquake's) and it starts flood the whole building and soon falls over.I got nothing against Alexandra Daddario. I've seen her do a solid performance in TV shows and movies, but she wasn't all that great in the movie, actually she was pretty bad. She kept doing that boring looking face even when this big disaster is happening around her.Overall San Adreas is a enjoyable action movie. As I said before it's not flawless but it's better then most disaster movies that we got today. I thinking if this movie came out in the 90's this would have been a smash hit and this could have been the next Independence Day, just think about it.",San Andreas

136,ArchonCinemaReviews,Surprisingly intense and heart pounding disaster action film!,7,3 June 2015,"Heart-pounding, entertaining and surprisingly good for a thrilling action disaster movie.In seismology terms, the west coast is experiencing a swarm event. The shaking of the San Andreas fault line is not over, and that's not from after shocks. The people of California need to get out. One family, led by a rescue chopper pilot, journeys on a dangerous mission to save their daughter during the extreme state of emergency.Within five minutes, San Andreas decisively tells audiences that this action film is not going to be that type of movie. Immediately avoiding cliché plot points and basic story telling, San Andreas resoundingly gets viewers ready for an original take on the 'disaster film' archetype.The specific movie genre has certainly taken a nose dive in popularity in recent years. Perhaps San Andreas will give way to some diversity in the films offered to audiences through popular box office release. For a disaster movie, San Andreas is a good one, the action is well plotted and frenetically chaotic, albeit mainly computer generated.The thrills catch audiences off guard and thrash them about, but are only effective because there is sufficient character development early on. The casting of all main characters who appear capable to endure the devastation. Carla Gugino, Dwayne Johnson, Alexandra Daddario, Hugo Johnstone-Burt, Paul Giamatti and Ioan Gruffuld are spot on perfection given their character's motivation and help to retain engagement.As a narrative, San Andreas is fluid and natural with very few lulls and distractions. Yes, there are some dramatic subplots that some may deem unnecessary, but the overall trajectory of the plot follows a linear path.San Andreas is heart pounding and surprisingly good and plays on the fear of the ""big one"" perfectly. And just so he knows: I trust you Dwayne Johnson, you can come to my rescue any time.Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases.",San Andreas

He Was Getting Divorced with his Wife (Carla Gugino) Emma Gaines actress who played with Dwayne Johnson Faster (2010)weird that she wanted to be with different man(Ioan Gruffudd)Daniel Riddick Fantastic Four. he's name his Riddick felt like director or script writes had stole name from Vin diesel film Riddick, Daughter of Ray i wasn't fan of (Alexandra Daddario) Blake Gaines was eh OK i wasn't fan of her i wish there was another chance's of getting another actress. to movie had good Earthquake graphics like (2012) there was some unrealistic scenes like (1) girl drives car rolls over like 10 times she has still has survived ? she was not even hurt or bleeding she was just normal not unconscious (2) when Dwayne and Carla was running around looking for car or something to drive or fly but they turned around they have found boat straight away like i am asking god for something comes out no where in real life disasters they would have look for that boat for 10 years ! i know it's movie in every disaster movie is unreal like 2012.(3)i have hated character Daniel Riddick try to save his girlfriend daughter try to ask security guard for help then floor smashed into guard he was in shock not worrying for his daughter who was stuck in car he asked for help then he doesn't go back wait i thought he was Mr Fantastic to get his daughter out there but what kinda father is he ? later on someone was recuse Blake was Ben, Hugo Johnstone-Burt was each another in film in all hour with annoying little brother. Kylie Minogue is in this movie isn't there better chance to get another actress out there ? Kylie was horrible in movie playing Daniel brother Susan. later on Emma she wanted to go back with Ray Emma say's You left my daughter alone? If you're not already dead, I'm going to kill you. OF CROUSE i thought he was going to be good father not leaving his girlfriend daughter beyond stuck in car following another people being broke Daniel Riddick was dumb character i hated no cared.but there were good moments with the Dwayne Johnson saving the day and getting back with his wife and saving his daughter, San Andreas is not based on video games expect there was one scene of movie when Dwayne steals car the car was stolen already someone has gun Dwayne Punch's him there was only scene but movie is not about grand theft auto. this movie i thought it could be boring like another disaster films i wasn't huge fan of. but i have enjoyed this movie with good main role in film one of my favorite actor Dwayne Johnson had spot on perfection given this character motivation and help everyone to retain engagement. witch is good in film the only thing i like about is Disasters scenes good CGI witch wasn't to bad. i haven't seen 3D in film, cast Dwayne Johnson witch is good role for actor to play film. when I read the title it said San Andreas I was like what they are making a grand theft auto movie ? This is what happens when they get wrong director to expect him to do movie there is better directors but i liked to get Ronald Emmerich directing this movie director Brad Peyton put a stupid director in charge in this movie when directed Cats and dogs ? that franchise i never cared for Journey franchise but i wish this movie did a little bit better. but i had fun with movie still and It Had Good Main Role in movie Dwayne Johnson i would have say it's watchable i would have watched this movie again and again only for Dwayne Johnson movies he hasn't done many action movies this movie is not action movie i know it, it's disaster film with good main role Dwayne Johnson could smell what's cooking out there ?

The screenplay was written by Carlton Cuse, with Andre Fabrizio and Jeremy Passmore receiving a story credit. The film stars Dwayne Johnson, Carla Gugino, Alexandra Daddario, and Paul Giamatti.Raymond 'Ray' Gaines (Johnson) is a Los Angeles Fire Department helicopter-rescue pilot. In the midst of a divorce from his estranged wife, Emma (Gugino),[5] he calls his daughter, Blake (Daddario), to talk about their upcoming trip to San Francisco. Meanwhile, Caltech seismologist Lawrence Hayes (Giamatti) and his colleague Dr. Kim Park (Will Yun Lee) are at the Hoover Dam making a breakthrough in earthquake prediction when an unknown fault nearby ruptures, triggering a magnitude 7.1 earthquake which collapses the dam, killing Park in the process, but he gave his life when he saved a girl. After Ray is called into work, Blake reluctantly decides to go with her mother Emma's new boyfriend, Daniel Riddick (Gruffudd), a wealthy real estate developer, to San Francisco where he is completing a high-rise building in downtown.

142,stevenrotherforth,Kylie's not singing anymore!,7,29 April 2021,"San AndreasLoud and proud are probably the best words used to describe this disaster action movie starring Dwayne Johnson.It's all out spectacle with some impressive CGI and action set pieces to get the heart pumping.Of course there's going to be no Oscars for the dialogue but everyone involved delivers their performance with conviction. Even the gorgeous Alexandra Daddario is believable as Johnson's onscreen daughter despite being only fourteen years younger than him in real life. Carla Gugino and Paul Giamatti round off a likeable cast.There's even a brief appearance by pop princess Kylie Minogue. ""I should be so lucky!"" Isn't something she sings as she opens the wrong door during a rather nasty quake.The plot is a simple one. In the aftermath of a massive earthquake in California, Chopper pilot Ray (Dwayne Johnson) risks his life to save his family.San Andreas is basically a string of action scenes tied together to make a good time at the cinema. On the big screen is the best way to watch this movie or on a huge TV with a dedicated Home Theatre AVR and a set of beefy speakers. Weedy Sound-bars with no subwoofer need not apply here. This movie deserves a monstrous sound system to really make the most out of the crumbling skyscrapers and rupturing landscapes. The Dolby Atmos sound mix is an absolute belter.In 4K HDR this movie looks superb. A crisp clean 4K Image packed with detail. Pores and wrinkles are rendered accurately and you can even see the skin texture on Dwayne's bald head. HDR makes that dome of his all the more shiny. This is a movie worthy of owning on 4K Blu-ray to show off that new TV or UHD projector.San Andreas is a reminder of the classic disaster movies from the 70's only with much better special effects. It's not a perfect film but it's a bloody good time and that's what movies should be all about.",San Andreas
143,peefyn,Mother nature,7,2 June 2015,"I know next to nothing about the science this movie is based on - or most likely ignores - so my viewing experience was not affected by any such knowledge (or lack thereof).The plot of the movie could be described as a series of earthquakes, and the series of last-moment-situations a family face during it.Of the many levels of relationship that are explored in this movie - like the one between divorced parents, parents and daughter, girl and boy, older brother and younger brother, step dad and stepdaughter, scientists and media - the only one that really caught my interest was man and nature. The other ones are mostly forgettable. Johnson plays himself as a guy that rescues people, and does exactly what you want from him. The rest of the cast too, I guess. But the real treat of the movie, is how it shows off the destructive powers of nature. This movie is not people trying to fight that power, but rather avoiding to succumb to it completely. There is no fight against nature (in this movie), but rather just a hope for survival.The one thing this movie is missing is an ending scene similar to those found in old cartoons like He-man and G. I. Joe, where the main character speaks directly to the camera, and talks about the dangers in the story you just witnessed. I would have loved to have a scene where Dwayne Johnson talks about the dangers of earthquakes, and what to do in them. Preferably dressed up as He-man.",San Andreas
144,p-jonsson,Very Hollywood and still I liked it...a lot,9,2 November 2015,"This is a classical Hollywood movie, thin plot and a lot of effects. However, this time, I quite liked it. Actually I liked it a lot. The plot, although thin, is not altogether bad, it holds together even though are quite a few unbelievable moments. However, put in the context of a traditional disaster movie, it is not bad.. Maybe this is what I like about the movie. It is really a good old fashioned disaster movie.When I first read the blurb about this movie I was afraid that it was going to be a big apocalypse at the beginning and then it was going to be a ""slow"" search for Ray's daughter. It is nothing of the kind. It has a decent build up of suspense up to quite a few more or less spectacular earth quake scenes  and then it continues. I was pretty happy that there was a decent build up from the start but I was even more happy that the initial earth wrecking event was actually not the big event.As I wrote at the beginning, the plot is pretty thin. The special effects are not however. At least, I liked them. Not surprisingly houses a are falling over like there was no tomorrow (which for a lot of people there are not) but it is done quite well. I also liked the scenes where the earth wobbles when Ray and his wife flies over it in his chopper. I found that quite cool. There are a few moments that are, well let us say not too well thought through. For instance the classical collapsing building that collapses in the just the right pace for the heroes to do there job. The we have when Ray and his wife speeds through the waters of Los Angeles after the quake, which are riddled with trash. The amount of trash in the water would have rendered their propeller useless after a few hundred meters. But then, I think I am too much of an engineer now.Speaking of Ray's wife. That was one of the things I really did not like with the movie. Maybe the movie directors and actors in Hollywood are so used to divorcing all the time that they think it is a ""standard"" plot element and do not think twice about it but for us other ""ordinary"" people it is a tragedy (especially people outside of the US apparently if one should go by the trash that is spewed out from Hollywood all the time) and I really do not want to watch that crap all the time in movies and TV-shows! I was actually tempted to downgrade the movie at last a star, even two, for that crap but what the heck, it is a good movie and I do like ""The Rock"".So after, after that little outburst, I have to say that I this one was a really enjoyable movie. One of the few lately that I have watched. It is a quite good, classical, disaster movie with a good build up, really good effects and a good and happy ending (for the main characters at last) and I am a sucker for happy endings.",San Andreas
145,dcarsonhagy,Another Disaster of a Movie,5,14 October 2015,"If you believe the west coast, especially Los Angeles and San Francisco, can survive a 9.1 earthquake, followed by a 9.5 earthquake, and then a tsunami, this will be your cup of tea. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson plays the lead as a rescue person piloting a helicopter to find damsels in distress. It seems he is in the process of an amicable divorce and is trying to get his daughter to Washington state to further her education. Then the FIRST grand-daddy of ALL earthquakes (there are actually TWO of them) hit back to back, daughter is misplaced in San Francisco, so its up to mommy and daddy to find daughter before, oh, I don't know, she's hit with irritable bowel syndrome. All this movie does is offer TONS of CGI effects and mayhem galore. I will say it did not get too maudlin with the daughter-in-distress situation, but it came terribly close.

146,rooee,Nothing shakes the Rock,4,11 June 2015,"Dwayne Johnson reunites with Journey 2: Mysterious Island director Brad Peyton for a cacophonous crumble-'em-up in which a chunk of the US West Coast is hit by the biggest earthquake in recorded history, shaking loose all manner of clichés and stock characters. The best of them is an exposition-spouting scientist (he even has his own personal journalist to ask him direct questions) played by Paul Giamatti. It takes an actor of Giamatti's calibre to make this direlogue sound vaguely convincing. But still, he's a mouthpiece rather than a character as such. Unlike Hercules, which was smart-bad, San Andreas is dumb-bad: a series of dramatically empty and conspicuously bloodless destruction sequences connected by a frankly boring family drama. Johnson plays Ray Gaines, an air rescue pilot whom we meet in the midst of a divorce. He and his wife (Carla Gugino) split after the death of their daughter, and now she's shacked up with a coward. But then the earth moves (literally), and Dad and Mom join forces to save their daughter (Alexandra Daddario), who's tossing and turning in San Francisco. After a series of laughable coincidences, which give the sense that the Gaines family are merely playing a virtual reality game together and can locate each other on a mini-map, it ends with a very tedious and predictable sequence half-inched from James Cameron's The Abyss. For the most part, with its linear family rescue plot, it's a re-run of The Day After Tomorrow – but Johnson is no Quaid, Daddario is no Gyllenhaal, and Peyton is no Emmerich. Yes, really – Roland Emmerich might make mega-trash but at least knows how to frame it, and build tension, and he knows when tongue and cheek should meet. Despite some admirable attempts at single-take immersion, Peyton's setpieces build from nothing to sudden empty bluster, suitably chaotic but shockingly weightless. There's nothing wrong with CGI – actors have been acting with nothing really there since the dawn of film – but there's no excuse for making the end of the world so boring. This is a mostly humourless film except for some light relief in the form of Hugo Johnstone-Burt and Art Parkinson, playing bumbling, brave English brothers who both fancy the pants off Ray's daughter. But even this almost-fun aspect is turned groaningly earnest at the end – spoiler alert! – as Ray looks upon ground zero and says it's time to ""rebuild"". With the plucky-but-weedy Brits alongside him, and the Stars & Stripes draped across the Golden Gate, it's the most cumbersome metaphor for post-9/11 transatlantic relations I've seen in some time. Cumbersome describes this film. We're promised epic and we get lumbering; we're promised adventure and we get a rote rehash of tired themes. It's a weak tremor at best, and not amusingly rubbish enough to deserve a really terrible rating.",San Andreas
147,room102,"Painful to watch, one of the worst movies of 2015",2,14 September 2015,"My god, what a gut-wrenching schlock. This movie is beyond awful, it's lowering your IQ with every passing minute. This is ""2012"" meets ""The Day After Tomorrow"" meets... well, basically any other Emmerich/disaster movie. But even Emmerich is more self-aware and I think that EVEN Emmerich doesn't take himself as seriously as this movie tries to do.The movie isn't simply a formulaic, predictable, full of every cliché in the book, kind of disaster movie. The dialog and direction are so awful that it makes Emmerich movies feel like ""Citizen Kane"" in comparison. The direction makes it painful to watch and you can't help but feel sorry for the actors. The dialog is as if the movie was written by a 7-year old and intended for blind people - every character has to use his own name, the name of the other character and state the obvious situation. Or just throw a cliché sentence.The plot, situations and flow of the movie are taken directly from the students book called ""Formula for Disaster Movie"". Oh, and don't forget to throw a few ""Superman"" situations here and there, just so it wouldn't look as if the lead actor only concerns about his own family while everybody else dies (see: ""2012"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow"").All the cast is simply awful. It's a combination of terrible acting, terrible writing and terrible direction. Even Dwayne Johnson, who I actually consider a decent actor (at least for his genre), can't save these awful script, plot and direction.The movie is simply painful to watch. Every line and every scene is worse than the other.The movie's ONLY redeeming element is the CGI, which is decent and nothing you haven't seen in any ""Transformers"" movie; and like in any Michael Bay movie it's so over the top and the situations are so absurd, that it simply loses the affect.I SHOULD mention that I can't remember the last time I've seen such a lazy, obvious use of green screen (especially anything involving the boat). Even George Lucas would be embarrassed to watch it.BTW, I'm not a doctor, but I do believe that 4 minutes with water in your lungs would make you brain dead.If you like this movie or think it's better than any other disaster/Emmerich/Bay movie, there is something wrong with you.Yeah, I didn't forget about the actress. She's awful. She's no better than Megan Fox in a Michael Bay movie. And no, I don't think she's wood (well, except for the diving scene). I might be going gay, but I've seen much more attractive actresses - and each of them was more talented too.",San Andreas
148,James_De_Bello,6/10,6,28 May 2015,"If you understand what a disaster movie is about and how it works you will go and have a nice experience just as I did, certainly superior to the ""2012"" or ""Day After Tomorrow"" dullness.The usual cheesiness in disaster movie is there, the characters are so stereotypical it's hardly believable and worst of all it commits the usual, stupid mistake of having characters make it out of a situation just in time before everything collapses. This mistakes really annoys me firstly because it repeats itself a dozen times in the film but most of all because it's worthless: it does not add stakes or tension, they would be exactly the same, but except for maybe twice in the film situations get resolved just in time and the uselessness of it really annoyed me. The film tries too hard to give it's characters depth and barely succeeds in it. I cannot deny I was rooting for them, that maybe being due to the fact that the actors involved are honestly all doing a good enough job, but the fact that it tries to achieve character empathy through clichés that have been present in cinema since the beginning of time is ridiculous.That being said, it does deliver the goods of a disaster movie and delivers them much more competently than the recent disaster films we have seen on the big screen. With the exception of the finale where things are unnecessarily blown up to eleven, there isn't exaggeration. The set pieces are for the major part breath-taking and original enough. I counted actually two times where my mouth totally dropped in genuine amazement. I was riveted by many scenes and this is probably due to the fact that the director never overuses CGI. It is used in the perfect dose, there is enough practicality involved and the fact that the set pieces aren't always the biggest most blown up ones made it better, it gave the film more stakes. Moreover there is a great use of long takes in certain parts of the film, one in particular is very long and threw me right into the action like no other disaster movie ever had done before.If you know what you are in for you will have a good time and you will be given back your money's worth, you won't want to be re-watching this movie anytime, but that is perfectly fine and fits the film in what it is trying to achieve.",San Andreas
149,scottshak_111,Nature isn't shoddy. This movie is.,5,19 June 2015,"Earthquakes and Tsunami couldn't save this disaster of a movie. So pathetic that it would make you question your life choices! To begin with, we don't have a good story, okay probably a clichéd one. Drama is literally absent when you see confused faces, remote feelings that are further made shoddy by the poor screenplay. The latter department has just words, unfelt and bland. Carla just goes on to embarrass us further by reacting awkwardly with dialogues like, ""You left my daughter alone?"" and creates a see-through anger glass that becomes sad at one point. Dwyane, The Rock he is, didn't have to try hard to play himself. Alexandra Daddario sizzles on screen but her inclusion seems deliberate by the casting director. Bringing Paul Giamatti into this was simply a waste of talent.Whilst the movie quaked, I thought probably a Tsunami would bring home a twist. But to my surprise things kept going downhill. There is no profundity in the movie. No gravity to frame creation. Pathetic actors that make everything just look crappier than it already was.Trying really hard to look at the bright side, I would say visuals sometimes looked rad. But does it really matter when you make such a bad flick? To sum it all up, Peyton sucks!",San Andreas
150,kgprophet,Master Disaster,6,30 May 2015,"When I saw the trailer for the movie ""2012"" in 2009, I thought 'this is it', this movie is the one to end all disaster movies. Indeed, San Andreas is the first big budget disaster movie to come out since then. So the big problem for any new disaster movie is to avoid ""been there, done that"". It is a checklist now that these kind of movies go through. To my surprise, San Andreas found a way to outdo previous disaster films. My guess is that the original cut of this film ran the length of ""2012"" ( a punishing 2 hours and 40 minutes), and the filmmakers were smart enough to cut this down to the 2 hours audiences expect. They probably excised a great deal of schmaltz and lingering around, making what's left a film that has very little padding. That means that there is more screen time for the effects shots. I thought after seeing ""2012""... ""OK, California tipping into the ocean, that can't be beat"". In San Andreas, you don't get 1 shot of California falling over, you get 10. Same thing for the ""Day After Tomorrow"" scenes with the city being deluged by water. That was a 5 minute sequence in DAT, in San Andreas it's the entire third act. In San Andreas the effects shots are so numerous that you can linger over them. The destruction of the iconic TransAmerica building is just part of an extended sequence. Buildings being destroyed are so abundant and believable, you actually get a sense of gravitas.For a summer popcorn film, the producers of this film were able to exceed expectations. Rock Johnson didn't spew out more than a couple one-liners. The cliché bad guy didn't go over the top. The family soap opera was done tastefully even though it was as flimsy as a soap bubble. Paul Giamatti provided some welcome energy, even though he is stuck with some of THE WORST dialogue ever heard on film. His scenes are brief, giving us no time to explain in great detail how their new earthquake predicting thingamajig works. And who cares, the message of impending doom is crossed off the checklist. The filmmakers also seemed to acknowledge that the few dozen other incidental victims that our heroes come across are given a quick send off and don't become extra baggage. For instance, our lamely created 'villain' is only revisited a couple brief moments after he runs off, no extended scenes of conflict or mean people stuff.I will reluctantly give this film a positive review because there has never been a disaster movie made with such good pacing. The third act is almost always a protracted rescue, with a overly melodramatic moment of epiphany involving relationships. In this case the pat ending is not drawn out, I could almost feel a sigh of relief from the theatre audience. I also must admit the improved pacing created some good moments of tension, despite the predetermined outcome.",San Andreas

Let's all pray they don't make a San Andreas 2. Unless of course, Carla Gugino and Alexandra Daddario unleash the Winnebagos. Then I definitely will tune in and laugh through another sharknado type session..so if you were hoping to see Carla Gugino and Alexandra Daddarrio show off their little baby bumper buddies, you will be disappointed just as I was disappointed.

I love a good disaster movie and I especially love a bad disaster movie and as visual effects improve year on year the disasters get bigger, and more far fetched.

As a series of quakes the begin to hit the San Andreas Fault, a Fire Department Helicopter Pilot is involved in a race to save his estranged wife and then his daughter from the havoc which is sweeping across San Francisco. Predictable over the top storyline with destruction on an epic epic scale, this film was simply marvellous to watch. Don't try and get anything out of it except the oohs and aahs of near misses and the satisfaction of the right people being squished. An endearing couple of English boys thrown into the mix and you have just the right balance of human despair and meteoric destruction.

156,troyputland,An epic disaster movie.,6,17 June 2015,"Disaster movies are a thing of the past. Their time was up when the millennium hit. Film companies have tried and failed since then (2012, Pompeii, Into the Storm). Nothing has made a lasting impression since the late 90's. San Andreas is an epic disaster movie of extreme proportions. Special effects have hit the roof. The earthquake (or earthquakes for that matter) that hits San Francisco is phenomenal. Tectonic plates shift, skyscrapers collapse and the body count is beyond imagination. Fire & Rescue good guy Dwayne Johnson's mission is to find his soon-to-be ex-wife and daughter who're grounded in different parts of California. A lot of saving's to be done before he can rest. Remember Sandra Bullock in Gravity? Once you think she's safe a new complication arises. Same goes for Johnson. San Andreas possesses the looks, not the texture. Most characters are underdeveloped, and every single woman's a damsel in dire need of rescuing. There's only one moment of compassion and sorrow, and that comes at a time when Johnson and ex-wife-to-be Carla Gugino should be rushing to save their daughter (Daddario). Style engulfs substance here. There's enough material injected to want them to survive, no matter how predictable events become. On a positive note, the set-pieces are at maximum intensity and Paul Giamatti's earthquake expert nails home the importance of preparation.",San Andreas
157,kermitkid,Fun disaster movie,8,30 March 2020,"While it is a bit cliche (even for a disaster movie), overall, the film is fun. One of the great things about it is it manages to be campy, yet serious. There are moments that were unintentionally hilarious because they were overacted and far-fetched, and yet it works. It's funny that ""The Rock"" is in a movie about an earthquake. The movie is a great mix of humor and drama. Amidst all the destruction, and death, and people running for their lives, there's still the occasional funny one-liner. It feels a bit like the movie ""2012"" at times, but that's a good thing, because I liked that movie. This film is the kind of film where you just turn off your brain for two hours and let the visual effects do the talking. Nothing more than that. If you try to take the film seriously, you probably won't enjoy it, but if you watch it as what it is, a film meant to be fun and nothing more, you will enjoy it more.

158,Thrashman88,Predictable Doesn't Always Mean Bad!,8,15 November 2015,"A disaster film! A Hollywood staple genre! Let's see:High budget, Hollywood disaster summer flick: Check Dazzling state of the art special FX; Check Average acting skills displayed through out the movie: Check Corny dialogue: Check Predictabilty of plot: Check Fun to watch from start to finish: Double CheckIn the great tradition of movies by Roland Emmerich and Steven Spielberg, Brad Peyton's San Andreas is all of the above and more. People expecting ""masterpiece theater"" should definitely look elsewhere. This is big, dumb, Hollywood blockbuster fun, done very good, even if we've seen stuff like this before. The special FX are top notch and they certainly elevate San Andreas head and shoulders above some of its peers. Shades of Emmerich's ""2012"", Mark Robson's own ""Earthquake"", and John Guillermin's Irwin Allen produced ""The Towering Inferno"" are present all over this flick, which has pushed the boundaries of disaster films to new heights. It's pointless trying to summarize a disaster movie like San Andreas, and the message is still the same: no matter what adversities mankind face, somehow they'll make it thru if they stick together. That's my take at least. And Dwayne Johnson's acting is pretty OK, much better than I expected, which made the movie even more fun to watch.I actually saw this expecting a very, very bad version of Earthquake or The Towering Inferno.

159,luke-a-mcgowan,Likable characters in genuine danger makes up for a cliché-ridden CGI fest,6,15 October 2015,"San Andreas is the latest instalment in the eternal series of CGI-fueled destruction porn films. During pretty much all of this movie, whenever CGI buildings are coming down or digitally created chasms are appearing in the ground, I felt almost completely removed from the destruction. At no point did I think ""oh no that's terrible"" I just watched it with a bored expression. Fortunately San Andreas redeems itself with surprisingly likable characters. Dwayne Johnson stars as our hero Ray, a firefighting helicopter rescueman who lives in a McMansion and is currently going through a divorce with his wife Emma. He also has enormous love for his daughter Blake, but is conflicted by his wife's new billionaire boyfriend Daniel. The clichés are still alive and well, but the screenwriters bolster it with a tragic backstory concerning the drowning of Ray and Emma's other daughter. Its only a little thing, but all of a sudden Ray's love of his daughter and his divorce from Emma are given context that make them less clichéd and more plot-oriented. Problems I had with how amicable Ray and Emma were suddenly fell away, and subtle developments like Blake wearing two identical necklaces were quite touching.Johnson is fine here, delving nicely into a quiet moment of grief during one scene but for the most part the movie misses his charisma. Daddario channels Maggie Grace in Taken so much that she even started to look like her on screen. Paul Giamatti brings considerable clout to the thankless background role of Lawrence, a seismologist. Ioan Gruffud does nothing to break out of the walking cliché he inhabits, idling down his well-beaten character arc without a hint of effort. Art Parkinson and Hugo Johnstone-Burt (whose character development begins and ends at ""British"") contribute quite a bit as two likable tourist brothers.San Andreas' plot has been done a million times, and on at least three occasions I correctly predicted the cheesy dialogue right before it was said on screen. There was one super cheesy line after a parachuting sequence that actually had me laugh out loud. Save for the tragic subplot about Ray and Emma's drowned daughter - the screenplay for the most part writes itself: loving dad whose ex-wife has a new rich man? Check he's a big letdown, allowing our hero an opportunity to put his family together at the end? Check someone saves a crying child from death? Check Our hero has to do something death-defying because his unimportant colleague screwed it up and after all, he's our hero? Checkcharacter walks through a door and then there's a big boom telling us they died off screen? Check Minor character risks everything for a stranger he met for a few seconds? Check Setbacks that are immediately alleviated by deus ex machina? Check No one except the characters seems to be doing anything but die or walk in the background? Check ""Don't die on me"" CPR scene? Check Then fill the rest of the movie with buildings falling down. That's a wrap, people!What sets San Andreas apart is director Brad Peyton's direction of those disaster scenes where our likable characters are in danger. During rescues of Emma and Blake respectively, there were times I genuinely feared they would not survive. As I said, the endless destruction of California was a bit too distant for me, but sequences involving our characters, I felt that Peyton had a good eye for. At the film's conclusion, I was genuinely happy our five important characters had made it, and I suppose that's all I could want from a disaster movie.",San Andreas

We have all heard about earthquakes and their devastating effects (one of which is the creation of a tsunami), but this film seemed to exaggerate quite a bit. It was like the natural disaster of all natural disasters.The effects were very good, and seemed pretty real. But as I just mentioned, it was a bit too much. Buildings crashing, roads cracking, windows breaking and mass panic everywhere. Seemed like something from The Avengers movies, with destruction after destruction.The acting was good and pretty believable. I can relate the actors to their characters, and Dwayne Johnson fits this kind of character, being the 'hero' in a family setting. Alexandra Daddario also did a good job and I liked how her character was pretty smart acting. I also really liked Art Parkinson, he played his part well and was very cute too. I'm a fan of Colton Haynes (Arrow), but he was only in the film for a bit in the beginning.The storyline is basically centred around the disaster, but with a touch of family cohesion in there.

Just in the past couple decades, we've paid to see the destructive power of volcanos (in ""Dante's Peak"" and ""Volcano"", both in 1997), large outer space rocks colliding with the earth (in ""Deep Impact"" and ""Armageddon"", both in 1998), creatures from outer space trying to take over the earth (""Independence Day"", 1996), global destruction resulting from climate change (""The Day After Tomorrow"" in 2004 and ""2012"" in 2009), and, of course, numerous earthquake films, the most spectacular of which is 2015's ""San Andreas"" (PG-13, 1:54).Like most disaster flicks, the movie named for the seam where two tectonic plates rub up against each other from northern to southern California follows a familiar formula. First, there's the relatively minor incident that serves as an unnoticed warning sign of the cataclysm to come. In this movie, it's the opening scene and sets the stage for the intense action we're about to observe and effectively introduces us to some of the main characters. Then, there's the heroic central character – in this case, helicopter pilot and search-and-rescue team leader, Chief Ray Gaines (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), a man who, naturally, has family problems. Gaines's troubles involve his wife, Emma (Carla Gugino) leaving him for failing to deal with a past family tragedy and preparing to move in with her new boyfriend, wealthy real estate developer Daniel Riddick (Ioan Graffudd), and Gaines having to let go of his daughter, Blake (Alexandra Daddario), as she prepares to leave for college.Next, of course, we have a brilliant scientist (Paul Giamatti) who tries to raise the alarm of impending doom and one key individual, a reporter (Archie Panjabi), who helps him spread his warnings in an attempt to save untold lives. We see these two, and those working with them, both share and observe a significant natural disaster, only to realize that it's merely the opening salvo, and try to warn others of the greater danger to come. We are, of course, talking about massive earthquakes and their horrific results. As if all that weren't terrifying enough, the story amps up the tension by making the quakes more powerful than any previously recorded in California history, along with having significant seismic activity along the entire San Andreas Fault (including a previously unknown section of it) almost simultaneously! The size and scope of these earthquakes may not even be scientifically possible in real life, but it all makes for one truly awesome spectacle. After that suspenseful incident at the beginning of the movie, we see a total of four major events, each more devastating than the last, combining to wreak widespread havoc, cost untold numbers of lives and practically wipe one major American city right off the face of the earth.Of course, as these closely linked natural disasters build upon each other, Chief Gaines uses his brains, his brawn, his courage and various modes of transportation to try and save his family. No small feat, considering the daunting obstacles presented by the ongoing devastation around him and the fact that, as the proverbial poop really starts hitting the fan, his estranged wife is in Los Angeles and his daughter is in San Francisco, while he's up in his helicopter not very close to either of them. Fortunately for all concerned, his wife still trusts him and his daughter has learned a few things from the old man, both head knowledge and strength of heart. It also helps that she had recently become acquainted with a visiting Brit named Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) and his younger brother Ollie (Art Parkinson), both of whom are nearly as brave and selfless as Blake herself. Gaines isn't the only hero in this tale. Good thing. In this movie, there's way too much rock falling even for an actor with that nickname to handle all by himself. All these characters are in for a hell of ride – and so are you if you see this movie.""San Andreas"" does exactly what it sets out to do – impress us, frighten us and entertain us. The scenes of destruction are phenomenal – especially if you see the film in 3-D! It's hard to imagine any disaster movie topping this one without crossing into the ridiculous. Some segments of the movie are so intense and frightening that it could almost qualify as a horror film. Yet, the horror is as much in your mind as on the screen. This movie shows very little blood and very few people actually getting killed, even as you know the events on the screen are resulting in the deaths of hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people. The accomplished cast sells the story well, with performances that are stronger than in most disaster flicks. Unfortunately, the script sometimes works against the actors. As great as the plot is, some of the lines are distractingly cheesy and most of the occasional attempts at humor fall flat. But none of that matters very much. Some lame dialog and a formulaic story aside, this is one fantastic and thrilling cinematic accomplishment. It's well worth your time and money. There. I've given you my advice. Now if you miss ""San Andreas"", it's your own fault. ""A-""",San Andreas

The Rock is getting divorced due to his inability to talk about his daughter's death who drowned and he feels responsible, he has another daughter the very fit Alexandra Daddario who was a lot better in True Detectives, the wife is getting shacked up with an obnoxious architect. Earthquake strikes daughter hooks up with an English bloke and his annoying brother both who went to the Dick van Dyke school of fake English accents. Smarmy architect gets wiped The Rock saves the day, rescues daughter, wife falls in love with the Rock, the Rock rebuilds America. Oddly after a busy week at work I did not hate it, quite enjoyed the visual effects and I really could put my brain in neutral, the acting was non existent as it really was a side show to the unrealistic scenes such as sailing up a 90 degree wall of water.",San Andreas
169,datorsiers2,Just another rehash,4,2 November 2017,"I can assure you have seen this before, it isn't any different from the classic Hollywood natural disaster movies, apart for maybe the slightly better special effects, but all movies of this sort have outstanding special effects nowadays, don't they?Every single natural disaster film cliché has been taken into account when creating this, makes it look extremely cheesy and very ''american'' with The Rock, of course, being the big, invincible buff guy who saves the day, in this case his family. I mean, the special effects were pretty awesome, but it doesn't have the ''wow factor'' anymore, since we have seen so many movies similar to this there isn't anything surprising. Without surprise the plot is extremely easily predictable and linear, i mean its so predictable you will easily be able to say what's about to happen in every scene, that's if you have seen about 2-3 movies like this.Overall, it can work as a braindead entertainment movie you watch, when you are seriously bored and don't have anything else to watch as it's extremely easy to follow and you don't need to think, just let your brain drift.",San Andreas

One of the top earthquake movies and one of the best disaster movies in general, as well as one of rock's best movies. Johnson is an experienced rescuer who often accomplishes the impossible. Unfortunately, however, he had not been able to save one of his two daughters and is separated from his wife, although he still has good relations with both her and his other daughter. His experience as a rescuer will be the key to dealing with the greatest threat from a natural disaster he has ever experienced so far. A series of very powerful earthquakes along the San Andreas rift will bring him close to his wife and daughter whose lives are in danger. An almost impossible journey to rescue his family from the greatest threat he faced. A quite serious film, much more mature than many others that Johnson played in and one of his best. Excellent directing and effects that are almost reminiscent of the 2012 film, but also plenty of suspense from start to end of the film and with quite good acting. It is recommended to all fans of the genre and like 2012 it should be mentioned as another reference film for its genre.",San Andreas

172,abouhelier-r,San Andreas,6,1 June 2015,"In the aftermath of a massive earthquake in California, a rescue-chopper pilot makes a dangerous journey across the state in order to rescue his daughter.San Andreas is directed by Brad Peyton and stars Dwayne - the Rock - Johnson. This film is the next 2012, it knows exactly what it is, it's a big disaster movie. When you go see it, you pretty much know exactly what you are going to get because the trailer told you. I'm not disappointed by this movie because I didn't have much high expectations regarding the story or the characters as those kind of movies have always been a showcase for great cgi. The attempt of the film to be deeper doesn't really rise above the cgi spectacle so it sort of falls flat. For the most part the acting is good enough but feels sometimes a little bit over the top, except for Paul Giamatti who was really good. The Rock is cool, he can rescue people, fly an helicopter and drive a boat. Moreover, the script and the lines in this film, for god sakes, they are so cheesy. Writers tried to focus on characters after the cool things happened and the pace slowed down and gets boring because it is just the same thing over and over again. For the characters development to work and the viewers to care about those specific characters they should have found a balance, especially in a movie that is just about destroying things. The specials effects look mostly good but it's like two different people created them. Overall San Andreas is full of cgi spectacle, buildings falling and explosions. These people know how to operate a good disaster movie but they don't know how to write good and interesting characters.",San Andreas
173,n-kefala,An earthquake of clisse,5,12 July 2015,"An earthquake strikes in California and nothing -but nothing- is like it used to be. This is a movie that you know from the beginning that special effects are having the leading role. The cast is okay (their performances is not for an Oscar and they know it) and their characters are as much interesting as a typical Hollywood blockbuster demands. I had fun with San Andreas, the special effects left me amazed and I didn't look my watch even for a minute. Okay, the story is about an earthquake, so you have a little bit of a drama too, but don't worry about it, Dwayne's Johnson muscles -for the ladies- and Alexandra's Daddario eyes -for the boys- should do the trick.",San Andreas
174,stephendaxter,"Fun mindless destruction, led by The Rock",6,5 September 2015,"San Andreas is a disaster film dealing with yet another earthquake, and a tsunami, and follows a family who always seems to get themselves out of the tightest of situations. So in other words, every disaster film ever, this movie had all the cliché's that you expect to happen in disaster films, you have super-humans breathing underwater for minutes, last minute rescues and lots and lots of ridiculously close calls. But what made this film more enjoyable than many other disaster films? Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. Everyone and their mother likes The Rock, he is one of the biggest names in the entertainment industry and such an incredibly likable guy, you cannot hate this man. So when you put him in a disaster film it just makes things much more awesome, and besides, if i was in an earthquake i would much rather Dwayne Johnson coming to my rescue over John Cusack. The reason why you go to see disaster films is for the crazy mass destruction of a city (usually San Francisco) not for the incredibly deep plot. So in my opinion i value entertaining and fun destruction more in disaster films over providing us a captivating and coherent plot. Lets start with that destruction shall we? because there is a lot of it, there are buildings falling onto other buildings, the ground collapsing, raining boats this movie had it all, and i was having fun with it. The impossible close calls would bother me if the film was trying to take itself seriously but it really wasn't, they went for visual effect over practicality and i applaud that decision. They went all out with the visual effects in this film and they look insane. It is one of the best looking disaster movies i have seen and the large scale action set-pieces were just awesome to look at. They are why you watch disaster movies an they did it pretty right. Next up is the characters, you always have a group of characters or a few groups of characters who in some way all know each other and end up running into each other in the middle of a city- wide catastrophe. Most of the time you only really like 1 or 2 of them and the rest you wish would be crushed by something, but in this film i found myself liking most characters. Initially, for the first 30 minutes i thought the side-plot was going to be generic and bore me to death and i also thought the supporting cast was going to be unbearable to watch, but as the film went on i found myself connecting with the characters a little more. Dwayne Johnson was really convincing as this huge heroic paramedic and i really liked Carla Gugino in the film, their relationship was generic but still interesting and kinda surprised me. Alexandra Daddario was also good but her and the other side characters didn't do much for me, they weren't really as interesting as The Rock. The biggest issue i had with the film was pacing, the disaster scenes were great and some of the family bonding scenes were good but the cutting between the two and time spent on each took enjoyment out of some scenes. There would be moments where the uneventful family scenes went for too long or it would constantly be swapping between action and family to action back to family. It just took me out of it a little when it swapped from fast paced to slow pace over and over.In the end San Andreas is not great film but it is definitely a very enjoyable disaster movie. The mass destruction and impressive visual effects make it fun and the characters and their relationships are alright times but the real star of the show is Dwayne Johnson who elevates the enjoyment factor to the power of 10. If you are looking for a gripping story and complex characters, go someplace else, if its mindless destruction you seek, this is the film for you. - 5.9",San Andreas

The destruction and even some of the death scenes are awesome and entertaining. Obviously being what it is, it is very effects heavy but good quality and smooth.Something small that really impressed me was seeing Paul Giamatti character of Lawrence, a scientist, actually leaving his equipment behind to run and help people when disaster struck. In most movies, the scientists always stay or go back for their equipment or step over people to get to safety first.An awesome disaster movie to just sit back and watch and one I will definitely be buying this on bluray.CHAPPY HOPES the Kardashians and Bieber were home when Hollywood went down.",San Andreas
178,metalrage666,Lovers of disaster movies can rejoice.,8,28 May 2015,"After years of being let down by disaster movies that have about 5 minutes of action and 85 minutes of soppy I need to save my (insert random family member and/or pet here), this latest offering comes as a breath of fresh disaster filled air.San Andreas finally offers disaster movie aficionados multitudes of awesome and well crafted scenes of destruction and mayhem that has annoyingly been lacking in movies for decades. Basically what we have here is a no-holds barred future look of what could possibly happen in the wake of massive earthquakes hitting the U.S west coast and devastating a large and ill-prepared populace, and the ineffectiveness of anything that human beings can devise to deal with such an event. Not long into the movie the seismology centre develops a new way of predicting earthquakes by tapping into various micro-quakes and recording their intensity. They try out their new technology on micro- quakes recorded earlier at the Hoover Dam and it's a success however, at that instant a major quake hits the area and the Hoover Dam is reduced to rubble, killing one of the seismologists. From that moment on, it's more or less a race against time as further quakes are recorded travelling up along the San Andreas towards Los Angeles and San Francisco. The Rock, Dwayne Johnson, is a helicopter rescue pilot and after a 9.1 magnitude quake hits L.A, he sets off to try and find his estranged wife and then his daughter who's trapped in San Francisco. Soon after that quake, an even bigger 9.5 quake hits and continues to pulverise an already shattered west coast. Unlike many recent disaster movies, whether it be twisters, volcanoes, meteors/comets or Mayan predicted apocalypses, San Andreas doesn't solely focus on the human or family element and it doesn't let the rescue of said people overshadow what's happening around them. The things that are first and foremost in people's minds is the fact that at any moment they can get crushed by debris, or by a falling building or be swallowed up by the ground they're walking on. The science, for the most part, is to the point, there is no boring politicking going on to try and slow things down, there's no endless or mindless talking while the world rips itself apart outside and sight unseen, and thank god there is no stupid dog or cat that constantly has to be saved at the expense of common sense. San Andreas is a strap yourself in and watch city skyscrapers tumble, bridges and dams collapse and tsunamis wash away what's left. I can't fault the effects of devastation in this as at times it felt like you're watching a real life news broadcast. I guess the most annoying aspect of this is that once again the hero is a soon to be divorced dad with soon to be be ex-wife who's shacking up with a new and richer man. Thankfully though the daughter isn't a little kid and a total pain in the A**. Think movies like, 2012, The Day After Tomorrow, Armageddon, Twister, Volcano, War of the Worlds etc. and even a child can see that there's a common theme happening throughout all these movies. It seems that we as audiences just aren't capable of relating to a family that's happy or stable for a change and there has to be some kind of internal melodrama running parallel to the bigger issue happening all around them. In some sense San Andreas has toned that down and not let personal baggage get in the way of a decent story, and while some people believe that this has reduced the tension, I simply feel that we are finally getting what we all paid to see. If I wanted to see some kid who still wets their bed because of their parents divorce, I'd watch a TV soap. This is worth seeing on the big screen for the sheer magnitude of devastation throughout. Hopefully though this is not a glimpse of what is yet to come for real.",San Andreas

It promises a wild ride that excites the audience without any intellectual effort and it delivers on its promise. Many have complained that the script isn't very intelligent. They're right. Every character is just a prop with an invisible label, every actor in it has nothing to do but act out their characters' clichés, every disaster movie cliché is recycled, and every major scene will surprise no one who has seen a disaster movie before. When the end comes for so many millions, no one stops to mourn, they just rush to the next scene with no thought. It was brainless and obvious, but so what? I was on the my seat anyway. Films like ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" ""Independence Day,"" and especially ""Earthquake"" have done the same thing, deliver mayhem and near-death experiences with style and expertise.

The story line and plot wasn't anything spectacular. It wasn't anything you haven't seen before, very clichéd and predictable. The Rock's performance in this film did give it that extra kick that was needed to make this film a bit more tolerable. If you're planning on seeing this film enjoy the ride for the visual effects and the action, don't expect very much more. I'm not going to say it's bad and I'm not going to say it's good.

181,iamtherobotman,All out action...down to a fault.,4,13 February 2018,"Ok, so what can I say? If you enjoy pure action, high drama and a barrowload of coincidences and near misses then this is the film for you.
I lost count the number of times someone escaped by the skin of their teeth sheer moments before a building collapsed or a bridge or a ship comes careering up Main street.Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad film, it's just all so predictable and gung ho and overly 'YEAH USA, USA, USA'. Sometimes it would be good to watch an Action film that perhaps wasn't quite as far fetched as Hollywood seems to like.
The ease at which buildings were ripped apart like sheets of paper was frightening. Surely in an area such as San Francisco which is in a high risk Earthquake zone buildings are constructed to a standard so as to be resistant to tremors. The buildings here were destroyed like the Three Pigs house of Straw. No building or structure escaped undamaged and that just simply wouldn't happen.Much of the film was well acted, i'm beginning to become a bit of a fan of Dwayne Johnson, he's not a bad actor in the films I've seen him in ( other than the Mummy/Scorpion King which were just really bad films), Alexandra Daddario seems fairly versatile in her acting and done a decent job here... On the whole there were no major complaints about the acting ability of the cast, perhaps the direction left a bit to be desired at times, but you can't blame the Actors for that.Some of the effects were well executed, the rippling of the ground as the tremors struck was nicely done, though as mentioned earlier they went a bit OTT with the destruction side of things.Overall not bad as a film, as a piece of eye candy not to be taken seriously.
But please, Hollywood, can we have a change from the norm. This type of film could be excellent but they rely far too heavily on these coincidental occurrences tightly packed into the 90 minutes and often the storyline ends up lacking.",San Andreas
182,lois-lane33,Brought to you by the American Dental Association.,7,8 June 2015,I'm just kidding. Its a funny thing though-the first 30 minutes of the film had more close ups of people with perfectly white & perfectly proportioned teeth-more than anything I've seen for a long time. It wasn't quite at cringe levels but it was close. Even the supporting actors had rows of perfect teeth. Good teeth look good. I get it. We all get it already. The actual content of the film (other showing perfect teeth over and over again) was well done. Big disastrous Earthquakes rip Cali a new one. The photographic handing of events that never happened was believable-and something to behold. Hope it doesn't happen. Could happen. Not entirely speculative fiction that there thing. Happened in smaller ways already. That big quake in 1989 for example. That wasn't special effects. Personally I've never understood mans compulsion to build things in areas that have proved themselves already to be dangerous. The online Prelinger Archives have actual footage available for free online viewing of the big quake in 1906 in San Fransisco-that is something to see. California isn't alone-there are several cities on the South American west coast right beside a dangerous fault line also. Plus they also have volcanoes-well they actually run all along most major fault lines.,San Andreas

184,justinwfirestone,Disastrous,4,11 July 2015,"My first experience in the UltraScreen®DLX with massive screen, Dreamlounger leather reserved recliners, and Dolby Atmos immersive sound with bass you can feel (it's true), was none other than to see San Andreas. If you haven't been following my reviews this summer, my goal is to review all of the summer blockbusters on cheap movie days for $5.My first surprise was that the seats are reserved. You get to pick your seat, although there were few left to choose from when I arrived. The second surprise was that the chairs are power recliners, so you just push a button and wham you go back and your legs go up. The third surprise was a smell I hadn't smelled in years, not since junior high locker room. It was a mix of people who don't like to shower, don't like to wash their gym clothes, and wet tile. Then a nice young couple who dry humped the whole movie sat next to me and at least she was wearing a strong perfume that mostly covered up the smell.But I digress. What about this disaster movie? It features a family (that apparently has no last name, at least not that I ever learned, nor is there any last name listed for them in the credits, so I will call them Family #1), a pretty family, an upper-middle-class family that is going through a rather benign divorce and Emma causes trouble immediately because she is moving in with a richy rich dude (who has a last name, because he's Daniel Riddick), a thoroughly loathsome man incapable of love except for buildings.Ray is solid as a rock, he's something sturdy, like a real man, someone you can cling to or hold on to no matter what. He loves his daughter, Blake, very much, because he blames himself for the death of his other daughter, whom we eventually learn died while rafting. You see, Ray is a professional rescue-chopper pilot, so the death of his daughter is as much personal as it was a professional blunder.The main problem with this disaster movie is that Family #1 is split in two groups, and there is no real belief that any of them will ever actually die, although San Andreas does feature Blake enduring the longest non-death sequence I've ever seen. In better disaster movies, like the original Poseidon Adventure (it's unfortunate that I have to clarify the ""original"" Poseidon Adventure) the protagonists are traipsing and shambling through the disaster together, and they drop like flies until the very end, when only a handful of the worthy and fortunate survive.The acting in San Andreas isn't bad, and it's not good. It's extremely okay. Poor Paul Giamatti, who seems typecast as himself these days.Things blow up, collapse, and fall apart real good. The special effects are pretty amazing and realistic. It's nice to see so many Californians perish as a precursor to the Great Water Wars of 2016. In fact, even though Ray is a civil servant responsible for saving lives, he tries to fly the chopper from L.A. to San Francisco to save his daughter instead of trying to save anyone in Los Angeles or elsewhere along the way. He _does_, however, trade a stolen pickup for directions to an airfield, which I suppose is a fair trade and shows he's a Really Good Guy.There is a bit of adventure. Ray commandeers trains and boats and planes. Well, no trains. That would've been pretty cool to drive a train through an earthquake. A simple oversight, I suppose. Nevertheless, I sensed the feeling of excitement at the thought of being in a real disaster, stealing whatever vehicles were around to go wherever I wanted. And it's nice to see a lot of chopper scenes in a movie. There should be more chopper scenes in every movie.Forget the millions of Californians who died or were dying along the way. All we care about are a handful of pretty, well-off people trying to survive the worst earthquake in human history. We rarely see anyone die, because they get swooped up or down or crushed. No bones, no blood, no limbs flying everywhere. It's pretty WASPish death, as people disappear in clouds of dust, never to be seen or heard from again.Despite all the Californian death and destruction, Americans can be jingoistically proud to see a final flowing flag confirming we are the best nation-state on Earth, and we will rebuild it all for the next disaster.",San Andreas

Most spectacular is to watch water flood to San Francisco. It is shame that the movies story is so full of cliché and American patriotism that you almost feel sick. Gigantic American flag at the end is almost too much, but if you can handle all that, the movie is quite enjoyable and beautiful to watch. 3D works quite well, but doesn't offer anything extra for story telling.

I can only think of three problems and they are so tiny they barely matter. Number one the Film is not the most Original out there but who cares about Originality if a film is Thrilling and Action Packed?. Problem two there are some Clichés in the film that I thought were a little bit lame.Problem three it was a tiny bit predictable but it didn't bother me Much. The Film is so Thrilling and Action packed that the tiny problems went over my head,they simply don't matter. This Film has so many good points and the good points outweigh the Bad points By Far!. The film has great performances by Dwayne Johnson,Alexandra Daddario, Carla Gugino and,Paul Giamatti those four were great and were the standout actors of the film. Paul Giamatti plays a Cool and Likable Science Professor who tries to warn people about the earthquakes that are coming. Dwayne Johnson does a great Job playing a Father as well as a Man who works for the fire department,he has a lot of cool scenes were he rescues people and I really liked him in this film he plays a really cool brave and Likable Man and I cared about his character right from the start which is another one of the films positives you care about Every Character and you want them to survive. The movie is full of likable characters so as a result there is more suspense because you want them to Live.There was good character development of the Main characters too which is Another Positive for this film.The Main story is about Dwayne Johnson and his Exe wife that go and Search for their Daughter who is in Danger. Dwayne Johnson and the Ex wife character spend a lot of the film looking for their Daughter and I thought there were some good emotional scenes between them. The Blake Daughter character becomes friends with these two brothers and Later in the film they try and help her when she's in Danger which I thought was nice. That's another thing I liked about this film you had characters that stood by each other and tried to help each other and I like to see that in movies and maybe that makes me a Softie but I Don't care because I like to have likable characters in a movie so I have people to Root for.I have heard people complain about the film saying it's too simple well I hate to break it to people but Simple is not always a bad Thing. This Film was simple but Effective because of the Emotional story and Thrilling disaster scenes.There were some disaster scenes that were so visually stunning my mouth hung open in shock at how great the scenes looked because all of the buildings and bridges that collapse in this film looked Real That's How good the special effects were!. The Film also has Great Music played throughout it and the Music fit with the Disaster Scenes that were taking place so I give a big Kudos to the Music composers for that. The Director and Writers also did a great Job creating a very Emotional and Exciting Disaster Thriller.This film also has Some of the Best Cinematography I've ever Seen I thought the scenery was beautiful and the whole Film was Shot Very Well so the Director of photography also deserves a lot of praise for his good Work too. I also Loved The music that played at the End of the Film it was very Emotional it was a good score and it fit the Film. Overall This is A Very Good Film it was Very well Made and it Deserves a Watch from everyone.",San Andreas

Basically I am fan of Dwayne Johnson I like him in furious franchise and now I liked him in his solo movie too......the acting was good and the most thing I liked was its ""SPECIAL EFFECTS"" they have did a really hard work on special effects the disaster designed for this film was ""EPIC"".Tsunami and especially Earthquake was awesome in movie and our Hero Mr. Johnson was just awesome his physique was like he deserved the role of a rescue pilot.other supporting cast were also good at their places it was not boring but somewhat a enjoying movie I haven't gone to watch this movie in theater because of the ""critics"" this movie is not as bad as critics are saying.its a one or two time watch but still a good movie.",San Andreas

The rest fails horrible by the 12 rating that gives you a feeling that none of it is real. They somehow stay crispy clean the whole movie and even forget there injuries when it's time to move on.The emotion tone of this film is also off .The drama feels forced and comes, in a lot of scenes, at awkward times in the movie.A lot of the dialog was predictable and also the total happy ending.I never liked""the rock"" as a main character. He always gives me a vibe of being a selfish man,him being a ""family man with a past"" didn't work so well for me.This all combined I stand by my rating and I would not recommend this ""filling"".It's ""rock"" bottom for this genre.Why do I wanna watch the Flintstones now?.Oh yeah....""rock"".(mumbling mad)To much ""rock"" in this review.",San Andreas
190,roddekker,Six Good Reasons To Dislike San Andreas,2,24 December 2016,"Here are 6 reasons why I gave San Andreas only a measly 2-star rating.(1) - The over-the-top heroics were nauseating beyond belief.(2) - The rescue team were all a bunch of cookie-cutter jocks.(3) - The scenes of mass destruction quickly became tiresome.(4) - The characters and their personal dramas all made my skin crawl.(5) - That irksome catch-phrase ""Oh, my god!"" was uttered about 1000 times.(6) - The waving in my face of the American flag was a truly cringe-worthy moment.Well, there you have it. I think that gives you a pretty good idea of this film's overall disappointment-factor in a nutshell.",San Andreas
191,Rawal_Afzal,"A mind-blowing 3D experience in every sense, yet the story falls flat on its face",7,2 June 2015,"The film is earning a lot and a lot of people turning up to watch this one, but the reviews by critics and on online websites have come down hard on this one for the lack of great or proper plot and story, and I would agree with this objection. The brilliant action and the great depiction of the disaster that an earthquake is, followed by a tsunami in this case, was damaged and marred by plot that had so many holes that you couldn't even count. This film should never have been about one family to begin with, which would have been alright had it been about a common family stuck in the disaster, but here it revolved around a person who works for the rescue department. He is never shown to be in touch with his higher authorities, to be carrying orders, or to be helping people in the disaster. He is just shown to be casually flying his chopper in the air when he finally gets on with his job to rescue his wife. So it all disappointed given that they had the action to make it a great film.I know it's just a film after all, but just merely the thought of such disasters and what everyone goes through, the running around to here and there... I remembered God Almighty after I was done with the film and had a chance to reflect upon it all once again.The best bit was the scenes of the split/parted pieces of the earth. I am not the most educated person on such topics, or in general, although curious and a seeker of knowledge I am, but I knew that such a thing too can happen due to earthquakes, and not just that the building and houses come down, but still to watch it was mind- blowing, mind- blowing scenes they were.So again, for the sake of some very good action, it remains a very watchable film. I thoroughly enjoyed it as a 3D experience.",San Andreas
192,vistheindian,Nothing ground breaking,6,1 June 2015,"Quickie Review:A series of small tremors on the San Andreas Fault lead to the biggest earthquake disaster in recorded history. Rescue-chopper pilot Ray (Dwayne Johnson) must venture into the middle of the aftermath to rescue his daughter (Alexandra Daddario) and ex-wife (Carla Gugino). San Andreas is visually a great cinematic disaster film. With that comes a lot of computer generated visual effects that are bit rough around the edges but deliver in setting the grand scale of the destruction. Yet the film falls into the same clichés of every disaster film ever that it becomes tiring. Burdened with overacting and forced drama San Andreas is mediocre at best.Full Review:The Rock fighting an earthquake? Yea sure, it's a ridiculous premise but we a have a charming actor as our hero and a plausible disaster, what could go wrong? Oh it's a carbon copy of all other movies of the same genre.Of course a movie like this can't be done without CGI. There are few moments where you can clearly tell the actors are in front of a green screen. However, when the city wide destruction is shown the scale of it all is very well displayed. More than once my eyes widened at some surprising incident as a consequence of the earthquake. I'm not a geologist so I don't know the specifics of it all but the overall sequence of events and damage felt realistic. I enjoy Dwayne Johnson in films because he brings a lot of his charisma to whatever character he plays. He was necessary for this movie. Without his one-liners that lightened the mood, the movie would be drowning in overacting drama.Question to Hollywood: why do we always need a divorced couple and d-bag stepfather in a disaster movie? Seriously, that can't possibly be the only way you can get the audience to relate to the main characters. Ioan Gruffund, who plays the stepfather is just in the movie to be a d-bag, who does one d-bag thing, to give Carla Gugino a d-bag boyfriend to instantly hate and fall back in love with Dwayne Johnson. This is not a spoiler, you know that's where this movie is heading in the first 10mins. To top it off the movie tries to be dramatic but it just ends up feeling like overacting. I blame the script and directing because the cast of this movie do have decent acting career that's better than what they brought here.All in all, purely considering the genre San Andreas delivers on the big devastation sequences. Great acting is a not a requirement for a movie like this but it definitely would have brought the movie to a more entertaining level. With some managed expectations you might leave the cinema liking the movie but not loving it.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",San Andreas
193,robert-259-28954,"Pure action, no acting allowed",5,25 June 2017,"Compared to The Rock, Arnold Schwarzenegger is like Sir Lawrence Olivier. His acting is like a, well, professional wrestler. The Rock only proves how low we have set the bar on movie entertainment. However in that aspect, this film is long on action, and little else. My ""5-Star"" review is for the special effects ONLY. I doubt that anything starring The Rock would be good for much else; the CGI is mighty spectacular, just as you would expect. It was realistic enough to put you off your trip to LA, or at least re-think it. If I was the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce, I'd try to have this movie banned. But if pure violent action, thrills, and mayhem is your goal, this film certainly fills the bill.",San Andreas
194,CowherPowerForever,A Fantastic Disaster Film,8,30 May 2015,"When San Andreas was first announced I was super excited for the film. First and foremost about the disaster element of the film. I love the disaster sub-genre of films. Adding Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as the lead only put icing on the cake. San Andreas turns out to be one exciting thrill ride from start to finish. It is not perfect in areas of acting and story, but the film is overall very fun to watch. The following is my review of San Andreas.San Andreas was written by Carlton Cuse, Andre Fabrizio, and Jeremy Passmore. Cuse is more well known having worked on hit TV shows such as Lost and more recently Bates Motel. Fabrizio and Passmore worked on smaller projects together such as a film called Special, and a low budget action film starring Bruce Willis called The Prince. The story area is one area of the film that lacks, but disaster films like this aren't known for great overall stories. Even my favorite disaster films of the 70s were written loosely. The film follows Ray(The Rock) as he tries to save his family during this mega Earthquake. Frankly, that sums up the entire plot of the film. Nothing else to really tell. The film really delivers on special effects and overall amazing CG. That will be talked about more in the next paragraph. Even with a loose story, the characters connect well, even if they aren't that well developed overall. Cuse, Fabrizio, and Passmore write a story that moves things along, and frankly the story outside of being thin is not bad, and doesn't drag on.The film was directed by Brad Peyton. Peyton directed another film with The Rock as the star called Journey 2: The Mysterious Island. The film is wonderfully shot, and for a thinner budget of about 100 million dollars, the CG is mostly enjoyable. Here and there it clearly looks absurd, but for the most part it was not noticeable. The action is the front and center piece of the film. With mega Earthquakes hitting California, the action picks up right out of the gate, not even 20 minutes into the film. Little buildup before that, and I'm glad they took that approach. Generally disaster movies that are made these days, which are rare, can cost 200 million or so to film. For them to make a film on a budget of 100 million dollars to look like this is impressive. Still has flaws in the CG, but overall this aspect was impressive. The acting department is lead by The Rock(Dwayne Johnson) and also stars Carla Gugino, Alexandra Daddario, and Ioan Gruffudd and Paul Giamatti in smaller roles. The actors overall are great. The Rock has never really delivered an amazing performance, but he has always leads an action film well. That is the case once again. Adding Cugino and Giamatti just helps out the overall acting aspect of the film. Peyton directs a fun filled action disaster film that most should enjoy.The film was composed by Andrew Lockington. Lockington is known for scoring the Journey to the Center of the Earth films(The Rock stars in the second film), and also Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters. The score for a disaster film is key, and in my opinion Lockington hit the ball out of the park. With many action scenes in the film it calls for a deeper score, but also low key material in more dramatic scenes. He adapts well over the course of the film, and his score adds amazing depth to this great film. Big thumbs up for the score of this film.In closing, San Andreas is just one heck of a fun disaster movie. With the sub-genre basically dead recently, it was great seeing such an enjoyable film like this on the big screen again. I'm hoping it saves the sub-genre overall, but even if it doesn't, this is a film to fall back on. There is still hatred for disaster movies like this from some movie goers, but if you are a fan of those older disaster films, you should find some enjoyment out of this film. I would highly recommend that everyone see this in theaters.8/10",San Andreas
195,boris_unanimate,Dumbest. Movie. Ever. Still hilarious tho.,3,6 August 2019,"I enjoy watching dumb B movies because they're either so bad they're hilarious, or purposefully dumb & bad, so that the audience is in on the joke.San Andreas was a disaster movie fan's wet CGI dream. Every scene and second without the main cast was decent. Every time one of them did or said something, I got an aneurysm. It's sad that this movie earned more than Blade Runner 2049.I know it's meant to be a popcorn flick, but the dialogues were awful and moronic. The screenplay was written by a mentally underdeveloped person. At least 2012 wasn't THIS dumb. This was a great unintentional comedy. Also, Alexandra Daddario is a terrible actress.",San Andreas
196,hoxjennifer,A Natural Disaster Roller-coaster Ride,7,9 June 2015,"San Andreas is bringing back natural disaster movies in style. Incredible CGI and special effects show non-stop, heart-attack inducing action through multiple earthquakes, countless building collapses and a tsunami to top it all off. On this front, I give ""San Andreas"" an A+. The action in this movie had my heart racing almost the entire time.The rest of the film sets everything back just a bit. Cheesy one liners (Ray: ""I can't remember the last time I took you to second base""-- you'll get it when you see the movie), remarkable coincidences and attempts at epic one liners *cue silence before said one liner and serious gaze into the camera*. On this front, there is nothing unique or special about this film. As a parallel to the whole state of California falling apart and eventually rebuilding, a running storyline throughout the movie is the protagonist, Ray, and how he manages to rebuild his broken family ties after being shaken by a tragic accident that eventually tore his marriage apart. Like any action thriller movie, there is inevitably a romantic subplot (or two!) in this film as well. Overall, I give this an A+ for special effects and action, but a B- for the film as a whole. If you're really into anxiety-inducing thrillers, you will enjoy this. Ignore the corny bits and you'll be fine.",San Andreas
197,Eric_Cubed,Better than 2012,7,25 June 2015,"Okay, here's the deal. An apocalyptic movie with the (C)ock, like Jean Claude Van Damme, like Chuck Norris before him, like The Expendables and every Jason Statham movie ever made, need to be assessed in context. Is this movie ""The Deer Hunter"" or ""Good Will Hunting?"" No, it is not. But does it deliver? Yes, it f----ng does. It's fun, it's grandiose, it's intense and it's over the top. But isn't that what we know going in? This is what makes it enjoyable. Not having our expectations high as a kite, we can really just go out and have fun with this one. All the uptight, White reviewers like Richard Roeper be da--ed. By the way, I pretty much enjoyed Battle Las Angeles, Godzilla, War of the Worlds, Outbreak and Independence Day. If you liked these too, you will like this one. Always confront the cynical haters who hate us for having fun, feeling good, expressing our passion, our sexuality and our vision. They are the conservatives of the world.",San Andreas
198,RMurray847,"20 minutes of GREAT destruction, surrounded by 80 minutes of below-average script and acting.",5,11 January 2021,"I have always loved disaster movies. They are almost all terrible, but they are often on the leading edge of special effects. And I'm talking about all the way back to Irwin Allen's TOWERING INFERNO or even back to GODZILLA. As a kid, those movies blew me away with their awesome destructive power! In recent times, films like DEEP IMPACT or TWISTER breathed new life into the genre, featuring what are now pretty dated, but were once pretty advanced, effects. I enjoyed 2012, not for it's great script, but for it's outstanding scenes of global destruction (and Woody Harrelson's delightfully unhinged performance).So I prepared for the same guilty-pleasures with SAN ANDREAS. But it let me down to some degree because the ""non-destruction"" scenes were particularly dumb and unbelievable. Bad script, bad characters, bad acting. Dwayne Johnson can be quite a charming actor and he seems on the surface to be well equipped for an undemanding lead role like this. He will never win an Oscar, but his physical presence and charm should have tided him over. But his part was SO painfully cliched and by-the-numbers that even The Rock crumbled under the weight of its high school level writing. It was as though a child had watched a bunch of disaster movies and was told to write the dialogue to be like all those. Or perhaps it's more accurate to say that it felt computer-generated. No soul...just plot points to tick off. Estranged ex-wife and her new husband who is clearly doomed to die (yep, just put Carla Guggino in Amanda Peets' role from 2012). Attractive daughter in distress, causing Johnson to abandon his role as a search and rescue guy when the world most needs him? Check. Cardboard scientific characters will little purpose other than explaining to us the ""science"" of what is going on in a vain effort to lend credibility (thinking DAY AFTER TOMORROW here). Check. A ""cute"" kid who is spunky but still needs a bit of rescuing? Check. A romance developing out of nowhere when everyone ought to be focused on things like staying alive and the end of the world (thinking the POSEIDON remake). Check.Add to that some truly dreadful performances by Guggino and Alexandra Daddario (as the daughter), along with embarrassing turns for Paul Giamatti (as the ""scientist""...hope he got a good paycheck) and Archie Panjabi as ""the TV reporter."" Just not good.Fortunately, the movie is still watchable due to its scenes of destruction. There is perhaps 20 minutes here of truly jaw-dropping special effects work as we watch major cities crumble to the ground in spectacular fashion. This is the stuff viewers like me come for. And SAN ANDREAS delivers. (I watched in 3D...the 3D is okay, but I don't think it adds so much that you should go out of your way to see it in that format.) The CG cities are convincingly rendered and more convincingly toppled. (Things get dicier near the end when Johnson and Guggino zip around on a speedboat through CG debris. They never quite look like they're really ON the water.) So I enjoyed those moments very much. They are just as rote and predictable as everything else...but as I said, I take guilty pleasure in these movies.So, for me, it's 3 stars. If you DEMAND good scripts and acting from your disaster movies...keep looking. This is perhaps a one-star film for you. And if you have a higher tolerance for bad writing and acting, then this might even be a 4 or 5 star movie. So take my thoughts in their context. If I watch this movie again some day, I'll be skipping MANY scenes and just cutting to the chase of some great destruction!",San Andreas
199,ukproject,Quattro Formaggi,2,30 May 2015,"A Quattro Formaggi is a type of pizza topped with four different types of Cheese, and San Andreas is a movie dripping with so much cheese that it would be an Oscar winner if they had an award for Cheesiest movie of the year.Spectacular special effects aside, this is one of the most painful movies I've watched. After shaking my head every time another cheese smothered Hollywood cliché hit the screen, by the time San Andreas ended I needed a massage to relieve the crick in my neck.IMDb should disable spoiler alerts for movies as predictable as San Andreas, but here goes:**Spoiler Alert** LOL Ray played by Dwayne Johnson is a helicopter rescue pilot. He has just been handed divorce papers by his wife who is moving in with her new rich boyfriend taking their daughter with her. Ray and his wife used to have two daughters but one of them was drowned in a canoeing accident. Ray had dived in the river but was unable to rescue her.This is the build up to the movie which takes place within the first 15 minutes.THEN a massive earthquake strikes and you should now know EXACTLY how this movie is going to end.*********** If you're the victim in a major disaster then don't count on the emergency workers as according to San Andreas they will be too occupied rescuing their loved ones to be bothered with what they are actually supposed to be doing. In the real world emergency workers like Ray would be vilified by the press, disgraced, charged with dereliction of duty, and then hung and quartered in a public square.There are movies where I just like to switch my mind off and enjoy whatevers on the screen. With San Andreas though you need to surgically remove your brain, flush it down the toilet and wave it goodbye forever in order to enjoy it.",San Andreas
200,The_moan_of_all_moans,San BLANDreas,2,8 June 2015,"Dwayne Johnson CAN'T act...I repeat... Dwayne Johnson CAN'T act. Does he have an incredible presence on screen? Yes; his build and stature are almost herculean(which is THE reason he was cast in ""Hercules"") and his drive? Well that can, and never will be questioned, the man is a machine, his discipline is astonishing. Those remarkable qualities aside, he CANNOT act. Everything is generic. His emotions, reactions, timing; they all lack genuine conviction. In this film (and in the majority of his other roles) It's impossible, as a viewer, to invest in his character because as soon as he opens his mouth, and delivers a cringe-worthy line or flashes one of his unnecessary, trademark smiles, you just can't help but begin a daunting journey, from optimism to despair. In my opinion an actors job is to make you believe they are the person they are portraying and i'm sorry but when it comes to showing emotion, Dwayne Johnson is currently incapable of doing that. Following in Ray's (Dwayne Johnson) unconvincing footsteps is Carla Gugino who plays his wife/ex- wife/love interest. Again, her delivery is dismal. Now, there may be people who would throw the blame to the writers, or the director for delivery or material. But i'll give you a perfectly appropriate example of how that doesn't sit well with me. Paul Giamitti. The whole film, for me, is garbage, but a great actor will take whatever nonsense is handed to him and make it work. That is exactly what he did. Why? Because he CAN act. The film really does try its best to overpower the mundane acting, by bombarding the viewer with good, but highly repetitive disaster sequences. It's basically rinse and repeat throughout the whole film. Although (due to the film's nature) it is wise to forgive any foolish moments in the film, it really does take the biscuit.Let's face it, disaster films have floundered in recent years and unless they are regrettably based on true events, they come across lethargic and show themselves in their true light. As moneymakers. Simple moneymakers. Oh here's a worldwide name, here's some CGI, take a cool cover version of a song for the trailer, that'll make up for the abysmal script, lack of actual acting talent (i mean what the hell was Kylie Minogue doing there? Seriously?)and the baffling lack of depth. It'll do its job, no doubt about that, but that doesn't stop it from being a disaster of a film.",San Andreas
201,irishm,Not enough characters,5,15 July 2016,"I was ambivalent about this one. The special effects were great, and that was what I came to see so I was more or less satisfied. The Golden Gate Bridge was in the wrong place and can't actually be seen from the Coit Tower area, but you can't have everything.Still, the movie was missing something. And after I thought about it, I realized that the missing element was character conflict. In the good old days of disaster movies (think ""The Towering Inferno"" and the original ""Poseidon Adventure""), you had a whole bunch of very different characters, often in conflict with one another, some of them even ""bad guys"" working at complete cross purposes, and that made the movie much more interesting against the backdrop of the disaster. In ""San Andreas"", the very few main characters have exactly the same goal, and most of them are even from the same family. (The two that aren't, want to be.) The lack of character conflict hurt this movie, and the cowardly boyfriend wasn't in it long enough to be of much help.Yeah, the effects were great. But for me, that wasn't enough to make for a really good movie. Maybe that's the way they do it these days, with a single big star making it ""his"" movie without any on-screen competition, but I prefer the old ensemble-cast way of doing it, with several major stars playing strong characters who each have his or her own personal goals and subplot, with everything tying into the main theme.A really good disaster movie needs more than special effects. ""The Poseidon Adventure"" only had two, but it remains one of the best examples of the genre because of the outstanding cast and excellent story-telling.",San Andreas
202,lovintennis,Predictable with poor special effects,3,7 August 2017,"The punchlines were predictable and corny, though the acting was fine. When the blond's car went tomahawking down the cliff, it looked really fake, like it was either computer-generated or controlled by a cable. How does the brunette remain scratch-less as she plummets on the roof just long enough for The Rock to pull her up out of the mess with his chopper? And of course the main blond who's stuck in the basement is rescued by the boys who decided they can't leave her (because she's a hottie) and is revived at the end by CPR. If she wasn't pretty, the boys would've said, ""To heck with this, we're out of here."" All in all, this was really predictable, corny, and thriller-typical.",San Andreas
203,name99-92-545389,"A ""me me me"" disaster movie",7,25 June 2021,"I expect most IMDB regulars are familiar with the argument that over the past 20 or 30 years animated movies changed from conservative fairy tales to liberal allegories. A less noted, but equally important change, IMHO, is in action movies.I think of ""traditional"" action movies as having the hero battling for society. He (or, OK, sure whatever, maybe she) may be battling in a personal context, but the battle is for society. Regardless of John Rambo's weird personal issues in the first movie, he shows his true nature in the second one. Bruce Willis might waste a few seconds talking to his family, but he is running around Nakatomi tower because he's a cop, doing cop things for the rest of us. Linda Hamilton fights Terminators to protect her son, yes, but with the nice side effect of protecting humanity.But at some point this changed and a number of action movies turned into not the hero for society, but the hero for his family (and mostly to hell with everyone else). Of course the most extreme version of this is something like _The Cabin in the Woods_, but that's almost a satire; I'm more concerned with non-satire versions of this story, like the Tom Cruise _War of the Worlds_ or _2012_. These are disaster movies that care only about the lives of one family/group; everyone else is disposable, and we're supposed to consider it a fine thing that the family screw over or at least ignore everyone else they encounter as they search for each other across various plot points. Of course, with such contempt for humanity as a whole, these movies are replete with scenes of people running around in panic, all of course clueless and turning rabidly on each other, even though we have ample knowledge of many many real world disaster scenarios, and this is not how they play out. Or, for a different version of the idea, compare a spy movie like _Anna_ with older versions of the genre, like _Salt_. In _Salt_ we have someone who is, regardless of everything else going on, at least trying to save the world. In _Anna_ we have someone who kills a few people (good? Bad? Who knows?) with the fundamental story line being that she wants to liberate herself from the system, and has no interest in saving the world.I mention all this because San Andreas is the apotheosis of this trend in the self-centered disaster movie. The instant disaster happens, our hero forgets his responsibilities to his city and cares only about his family. He's happy to requisition (and destroy) along the way a city helicopter along with multiple other stolen vehicles, all the while feeling zero guilt at abandoning his post. His daughter is no better, happy to loot a fire engine for supplies. The one villain is the person who walks out on the daughter of our happy family, even though there was nothing he could have achieved by staying with her.So yes, the graphics are cool, the daughter is very pretty, the story keeps your heart racing. It does what an action movie is supposed to do.Everything EXCEPT the single most important thing -- it doesn't give you a hero! It doesn't give you someone to look up to as better than the rest of us. It gives us someone trying hard to save his family, sure, but a hero is not someone who wrecks the lives of others trying to save his family; the hero is someone who sees the whole world as his family.I'm not sure if this is the new normal or a weird glitch. But I think that a society without heroes is a society that is not destined for much more greatness. There's something pathological in a culture so self-centered that it cannot even see that the central character of this movie is, yes, a big, strong, competent man -- but no hero.",San Andreas
204,urthpainter,Conditional Entertainment,3,3 September 2015,"So, arriving home super late, I found myself hungry, dirty, and in need of entertainment. I promptly began pouring a bath, and discovered that sharp cheddar, chorizo hard salami (nitrate free), and some dank pumpkin seed crackers would fit the bill for a snack. I clearly needed to watch something on my laptop while simultaneously eating and bathing, and had to make the snap choice between San Andreas or Turbo Kid for entertainment - seeing as the tub was rapidly filling. The problem was it was very late, and I didn't want to disturb the two college girls who moved in a floor below me only a short time ago. Back to the film analysis. Like I was saying I had to make a quick choice between films to watch. I knew the complexity of Turbo Kid would require my undivided attention to fully absorb, so I made the clear choice of San Andreas. Now eating in the tub is probably not the best idea, but when it is very late and there is only so much time of consciousness available, one must do what they must. San Andreas begins with a harrowing rescue involving a car and a chopper (not a motorcycle but the flying kind of chopper), and this is when the first of two unlikely things occurred. While constructing my second cracker a large slice of my sharp cheddar fell, and I heard it hit the plastic bottle I was drinking water out of. I should probably mention that when I first got in the bath, I didn't have anything to drink, and had to get out, choose a vessel, and fill it with water - I really had no way of pausing San Andreas without crossing the bathroom to hit the space bar on my laptop, and at the time a cool drink of water was far more important. So I was looking for the slice of cheese on the floor, which further distracted me from the movie that i was watching at low volume, and it was not to be found. Cheddar really isn't known for its ability to escape, so I checked the impossible, inside the bottle of water I had heard it hit on descent. The slice of cheese was in the water bottle. This is true, it happened. Wide thought the mouth of this plastic bottle is, it was an equally large slice of cheddar, and falling approximately two feet from my cracker assembly, the odds of this occurrence was slim. But I stray from my in-depth study of San Andreas. Because of the low volume, I really couldn't hear any of the dialog, but I didn't really think I was missing that much - there was the Rock, Tim Robbins wife from that hilarious show the Brink, and the daughter from Taken, with some other people I didn't recognize filling the roles of other characters Wait - there was also that heavy nerdy looking actor who is in all kinds of awesome movies, including the one where he is a comic book writer, that also involves an actor who plays Crumb. He's solid, which really made me wonder what the heck he was doing in San Andreas. Damn, my eyes are really starting to burn, and this movie is almost 2/3 over, so I should probably wrap up this review.At one point during my cleansing, I had to dry off my hands to make another cheese/chorizo cracker, and when drying my hand on the towel on the floor, I swore I heard a buzzing sound, but I knew this didn't make any sense, so I quickly shrugged it off and proceeded with my snack task. Did I mention the crackers were delicious? Its all about the ingredients, and all were top shelf materials. Damn, the stuff is really going down in this movie! That must be like the 15th skyscraper to collapse in a way that skyscrapers would actually collapse, not like that demo 911 falling strait down into itself at 9.8 feet per second squared. These ones are falling all sideways, it's Craziness! They must be in San Francisco now, because there's the baseball park where that juicer Bonds would hit all the homers into the water and boaters would all freak out and jump in the water to get his balls. Anyways, so I was getting out of the bath, and this is where the second unlikely thing occurred. I always dry off my face first, and while dragging the towel down my face, I heard the buzzing again. This wasn't a fly buzz - but a deep scary buzz. Oh, did I mention the only light source in the bathroom was a single lit candle? Believe me, one candle power isn't a whole lot of light. It's just enough to make my crackers, and witness the impossible cheddar slice in the bottom of my water bottle. So I was pretty much dried off, when I turned on the light and looked back into the draining tub, and what was there in the water? A yellow jacket hornet! Again, truth - fact, there it was. It occurred to me that I probably should have stepped on this beastie barefoot, grabbed it with my hand, or in a really unlucky move ground that bad boy into my face with the towel. I really think San Andreas must have had something to do with my good fortune on this night, which definitely will raise it a full star in my final rating. So in summery, if you have to watch a disaster earthquake movie staring the Rock, but can't turn up the volume to hear dialog, and your taking a bath while eating crackers with a yellow jacket present - I really can't recommend a better movie than San Andreas.final rating: 3 out of 10 stars",San Andreas
205,kdavies-69347,A film that missed the disaster movie era.,4,6 January 2016,"Director Brad Peyton and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johonson pair up again in the earthquake disaster flick 'San Andreas,' named after the fault line that runs across California.This is not as bad as I was expecting. I've never been a huge fan of the disaster movie genre, with such films as 'Day After Tomorrow' (2004) and '2012' (2009) usually falling flat in terms of scientific reality vs. Hollywood sensationalism. It's not very well acted per se, but you don't watch something like this for the characterization the actors try and portray in their roles. The plot is VERY basic... earthquakes happen, disaster ensues. No twists or turns in the road but it's not boring by any means. Does the gigantic Tsunami in the San Fransisco bay area make sense? No not at all, but it is entertaining for a disaster flick (most Tsunami's are only .5 meters to 2 meters in height in the open ocean, it is their speed, not their height that makes them so large as they approach the shore).I wouldn't go so far as to give this film much acclaim, but if you are the type of person who enjoys watching buildings collapse, explosions going off, and people dying in generally horrible ways, then this will be your type of film.4/10",San Andreas
206,moviescoundrel,This One Should Have Fallen Into the Ocean,6,4 June 2015,"What a cheese-fest. For some reason, when audience reviews were overall favorable, and Giamatti was cast as a scientist, I thought there may be some grit and realism here. Hmmnot so much. Special effects were quite good but this film was held together with a large amount of velveeta and fiction. Even in the first sixty seconds Ray's (The Rock) character was a bit far-fetched as he risked everyone's life on board for the life of someone in trouble. Lawrence (Giamatti) and his partner have a hypothesis about fault lines and earthquake prediction. They quickly and unrealistically prove this, and then just become a very annoying, unconvincing subplot.The rescue of Ray's daughter is the main driving force here but it just bleeds every bit of realism and plausibility from the film. She and her annoying, worthless companions conveniently get around every danger, and then her dad and mom somehow maneuver multiple vehicles through miles and miles of wreckage and turmoil and somehow find her amidst the wreckage of shattered city. Yikes. Not even close. Carlton Cuse (from Lost) is responsible for the screenplay here, and it just doesn't seem right. Not his style. Should not have been anyone's style. Boo.",San Andreas
207,georgecoffeynewyorker,OMG like. Was AMAZING,5,6 June 2015,"Oh wow, what to say about this film. hahaha. Mind blowing it was. Very emotional thou in particular at the end. The music would even help with your emotions too. For e.g, when the boat was being washed ashore, these two elderly couple hugged each other as if they were gonna die(which technically they did) and the music was like as Titanic kinda feel. You were left on the edge of your seat. Sound effects wow. Just wow. Music fantastic. Watch out for the new Hans Zimmer, Andrew Lockington. His music score in the film, was mind blowing. As I said to my mate, keep an eye out for Andrew. The only fault thou, was the PLOT. I couldn't get the plot. Two words my friend surmised it as ""No plot"". I literally can't give a plot. That simple. hahaah. But everything else, just wow.",San Andreas
208,JamesIan2021,An Absolute Blast,8,31 May 2015,"2015 may have the best action movie in the name of Mad Max Fury Road, but the year also boasts the biggest, most enjoyable and most destructive movie, and that's San Andreas. The premise is simple: The famous San Andreas fault line is active, the surrounding land mass will crack in half, followed by the obliteration of California. Add in some family drama and a whole host of characters scattered throughout the city and let chaos commence.The phenomenal special effects, in my opinion, should be considered for the next Oscars awards. The detail is so staggering and clear you'd be hard pressed to find any flaws. Not that you'll be hunting for any as by the time the first quake breaks out your jaw will drop at the might and enormity of the sequences. Director Brad Peyton (Journey 2: Mysterious Island) handles the action superbly, throwing you right into the deep end and grabbing onto you, the suspense is killer yet there's always a sense of fun. The sound design is tremendous, every single piece of shattering glass and rumble of debris envelopes you in the theatre, the illusion of danger coming from all around is alive and rather menacing.Lead star Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is on fine form, he is the most likable movie star, and most bankable. Johnson's charisma and screen presence is as powerful as the earthquake. His role as Ray Gaines, a helicopter rescue man, is utterly convincing. There are some strong female roles in this movie which is great, we need more like this. Carla Gugino is awesome as Emma, joining her ex-husband Ray Gaines to find their daughter Blake, played by the talented Alexandra Daddario. Gugino isn't a damsel in distress, fighting for herself as all hell breaks loose around her. One of the finest scenes of the movie sees her character Emma escape a collapsing building, taking refuge on the roof, as it slowly falls beneath her feet. Gaines comes in on his chopper and hovers above on a terrifying rescue attempt. Daddario is so damn good, after her kick-ass role in Texas Chainsaw 3D she proves herself once again in a role going up against all odds. Her character Blake is resourceful and motivated, and you root for her, hoping she'll survive. A big thumbs up to Paul Giamatti as Dr. Lawrence, a mad scientist sort character who runs around the screen trying to warn people about the incoming quake. Giamatti is so suited to the role, I couldn't imagine anyone else in his shoes.With outstanding support from Archie Panjabi, Ioan Gruffudd, Hugo Johnstone-Burt, Art Parkinson, Will Yun Lee and a sassy cameo from Kylie Minogue, a well rounded cast solidifies the wild California obliteration. This film is a must in 3D, watching The Rock commandeer a boat and ride a tsunami as it crests brings so much joy, this film unleashed the inner child in me as I leapt out in my seat in excitement, literally. Towers crumble spectacularly, land masses rise and fall plus the action shots are explosive enough to make Michael Bay green with envy. To those expecting a film that has logic, realism and a story that will stimulate your cranium, San Andreas won't be a wise choice, but in that case suspend your logic, forget realism and just enjoy yourself. It's not every day you get to see a film that has The Rock riding tsunamis and dodging collapsing buildings in a helicopter accompanied by the beautiful Carla Gugino. I reckon after another viewing of this epic summer blockbuster, it'll be even more fun. We need more movies like this, escapist fun that has the heart to go with it and the odd bit of Hollywood cheese, not to mention an ending that will leave you misty eyed and with a big grin after you leave the cinema.",San Andreas
209,fairlesssam,Complete pile of pap,1,7 June 2017,"This movie is shockingly bad. It is so utterly cheesy and corny it makes you cringe so much that you're doubled up on the floor. Dwayne Johnson cannot save this one.Right from the start it's ridiculous as a young woman in a car who isn't looking where she's going has the most horrific crash you've ever seen and LIVES!! I mean the car rolls about 50 times as it crashes down a massive cliff and she's thrown about like a rag doll but oh she's fine! The movie improves slightly as Dwayne Johnson enters as a superbly talented helicopter pilot and does some nifty moves to save the miraculous survivor. Also the earthquake monitoring people are engaging, the special effects for the hoover dam scenes are very good.However after those initial introductions it all goes down hill as Dwayne Johnson's character pines over his ex (soon to be divorced) wife and is shown as perfect daddy to his model-like daughter. Johnson manages to have a helicopter all to himself and miraculously rescue his own (soon to be) ex-wife and go on a mission to find their perfect daughter together. What a pile of pap.

In that sense, no surprise. Yet, somehow, one would have hoped that this movie would break the mold and make sense. But we have to compose with a grand total of 10? characters; a ""hero"" that goes from LA to San Francisco in a helicopter, a plane, a car and then a boat to rescue his ex wife and his daughter. Let's just woefully ignore that this would have caused the death of 30 million people at least and cheer. Average score because it met the expectation and was good looking in its disaster.",San Andreas
213,shinsrevenge,Not much there besides special effects,5,19 November 2015,"Sadly ""San Andreas"" is a barely average movie. It has some nice special effects, breaking dams, collapsing buildings and stuff. But the story is so thin and the characters so weak developed that you'll instantly forget about it once you saw it.The movie features Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as a helicopter pilot for rescues. He and his wife are separated and she has the daughter. His wife also wants to move into the big house of a rich man that she seems to be interested in. She also sends Dwayne the divorce papers to make clear that she wants to start a new live. So it makes perfect sense that she dumps the rich man with the first occasion, just to make up with her husband and talk about some past tragedy they went through and that really doesn't play any role in the movie. I mean, they included the fact that the two lost a daughter in the past in the desperate attempt to put some background story into the characters. But it's done in a rather emotionless way and you don't really care about it.Just like all the main characters don't seem to be that troubled with all the death and destruction around them. They walk and talk around as if it's not really a big deal. Gives away all the tension. For example, his daughter gets rescued by a young man (and his kid brother). She seems interested in him from the first moment. And despite all the terror around them and the fact that he just recently got a nasty leg wound, they have nothing better to do than look into each others eyes and kiss. Daaaww - no, not really.Did I forget something? Ah yes, the main story. So Dwayne gets separated from his family and tries to find and save them. Fortunatelly all the buildings and cars they are trapped in wait until everyone is safe and then, in the very last second, decide to collapse. How convenient.Just like the other scene with the broken highway. They stop just in time, so that they don't fall into the huge gap the quake has caused. No need to worry though. Walk a few meters back, talk with the only other car on this endless road and be surprised to find out that the man you meet luckily has some connection with a tiny airfield - somewhere near. So take the plane and continue the rescue.What are the odds? Don't think about it. If you can reduce your thinking to a minimum (along with the expectations) and just enjoy disasters and destruction, you might like this one. I value story and effects about 50/50, so it's altogether an average movie for me. Not a must see, not a total waste of time.If you however happen to value story higher than the rest, skip it. You'd be disappointed.",San Andreas
214,russellingreviews,"Not groundbreaking cinema, but it does suck you in",6,26 May 2015,"""Science fiction films are not about science. They are about disaster, which is one of the oldest subjects of art."" ― Susan SontagWalking into the cinema... The Rock in a disaster film about falling and shifting rocks. Ironic? Get ready to turn off the brain, watch cities be destroyed, have fun and even have a good laugh. Cinematic rating: 2.5 stars Reel Dialogue Rating: 2 starsDo we need another disaster film? When it comes to escapism, there is nothing like a good disaster film and it seems to be something that audiences want to see. Logic and physics need not apply. Script writers take a back seat to the CGI experts. In the case of San Andreas, it provides us something new: not just earthquakes, not just tsunamis, nor the typical well-timed American flag unfurling. What is new? We get The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) saving the world or at least portions of California. For those unaware, there is a huge fault caused by tectonic plates along the West Coast of the United States. These plates have been the cause of actual earthquakes throughout history and provided story line for many films. This fault line takes centre stage and is allowed to wreak havoc through many of California's cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and even, Bakersfield. Even though San Andreas is a multi-regional disaster, the real story is of a man striving to save his family. Ray's (Johnson) family has been torn apart by tragedy and divorce, but beyond the personal dramas he has to save them from these impending earthquakes. It may not be an original storyline, but the reason many will choose to go to the cinema is to experience the ground-breaking special effects that come from this genre, have some fun and may even have a bit of a laugh. Did San Andreas provide this desired special effects smorgasbord? To a degree, but it was not in the way that was expected. If San Andreas offers anything new to the catastrophic film experience, it is the breathtaking sound engineering. This may seem simplistic, but the sound engineering made this experience all encompassing and primal. Interestingly, it was the sound design that helps by adding a bizarre emotional component to the story. It allows the audience to feel the impact of the earthquakes and action on a new level. Beyond the sound design, the rest of this familiar tempestuous tale suffered under the weight of expectation. Not that there was a high level of expectation for the script, the acting, but the visual experience, albeit grand, is not original. Some of the biggest visual challenges in the wake of the carnage were unexplained buildings in two world class cities that contained minimal occupants, vehicles with unlimited fuel consumption and the 'needle in a hay stack' search and rescue process. Yet, even with it's failings, director Brad Peyton (Journey 2: The Mysterious Island) provides the unbelievable and makes it all seem probable through the adrenaline-charged action. Also, the inclusion of the family drama cast against the backdrop of a disaster helped provide the film with the needed soul and a reason to care for the characters. The expectations were for this to be silly and unbelievable, but ultimately it turned out to be fun escapism. Within the escapism, the questions get back to the primal considerations of the human experience: survival, salvation, the end of the world and the bond of family. In a year of disaster and dystopian films, it is easy to consider the end of the world, but San Andreas goes a step further and provides a glimpse into our need for others and especially family. In an unbelievable manner, this story shows the lengths people will go to provide care and safety for their family. This small familial nugget provides the gem amongst the falling rocks of California.Leaving the cinema... Disaster films rank at the bottom of the list of my preferred genres. Why? Each film has to find different and bigger ways to destroy the world and in the end provides the same result. When it comes to San Andreas, it does not break new ground, but even though it was ridiculous, it was fun and provided an enjoyable cinematic escape.

216,Blazehgehg,"A Very ""Hollywood"" Movie",7,2 November 2015,"Turn your brain off and grab your popcorn: San Andreas is another natural disaster movie that is so over the top it borderlines on silly. It doesn't quite reach the cartoonish levels seen in Roland Emmerich's ""2012,"" but that ends up working in the movie's favor as it does try to keep itself grounded in some sense of reality.Just y'know, a reality where a sizable portion of California faces maximum destruction.Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson plays the perfect man: a hulking mountain of muscle who always knows the exact perfect solution to every problem, which he carries out with flawless skill. His seemingly only fault is that he cares too much, a fact that threatens his marriage. He's passed these traits on to his daughter, and together they seem perfectly suited to do almost anything, including escaping the most devastating earthquake in the world.Thankfully for us, Dwayne Johnson continues to be a surprisingly competent actor. Though the rest of the cast is fine in their roles, The Rock really carries this movie, lending charm and just enough emotional depth to his character.San Andreas is not a hugely aspirational movie. In terms of pure destruction, it pales in comparison to other films, even though its CG is still pretty good. But there's no bars being raised here, it's just ""good enough"", and it nails that bulls-eye almost dead-on, even when the proceedings can feel a little predictable. Unless you're a hardened movie cynic turned off by excessively ""Hollywood"" movies full of CGI destruction, you'll probably find at least some amount of entertainment here.",San Andreas
217,Zaffy-1,like a TV B' movie,4,2 June 2015,"I am disappointed! I expected a decent disaster movie that would scare me a little but instead it almost bore me to death. I didn't mind the clichés or the bad dialogs and the lame story, I didn't even mind that the ""holy"" family of the hero survived. My problem was with the disaster part of the movie which was really not climactic at all. Very bad directing and special effects weren't enough to make you feel the terror of an earthquake (trust me I have survived 2 catastrophic ones, I know). Even the attempts for some humor fell so flat, mainly because there wasn't any tense in the first place to try and break it with a funny scene.Btw, I am not a seismologist but, aren't tsunami's supposed to be formed from earthquakes that happen under the sea? I guess an asteroid also hit the Pacific at the same time the quakes happened, but they cut it at the final editing. Oh, the Rock's character is the WORST rescue man in the history of all movies and TV. Ever.",San Andreas
218,prospectus_capricornium,"Sense-Juddering Visuals, But Logically and Emotionally Void",6,30 May 2015,"It will be impossible to chase after logic and sense once the Earth ruptures open in SAN ANDREAS. This doesn't mean there's plenty to find, because the truth is, there's barely any, but SAN ANDREAS doesn't really need to be logical for it to be able to deliver its sense-juddering capacity. The film works with eye-popping visuals alone, and this is why the film, amidst of all its shortcomings, is still worth seeing.SAN ANDREAS is exactly the film you would expect to see from a big-budgeted disaster movie. It teems with ground-cracking quakes, earth shattering explosions, and gigantic earth-wiping tsunamis. Through these visual tactics, the movie keeps the audience's attention glued on screen, that it would be impossible to ponder whether what's happening is still logical or not. This makes assessing the performance of the actors not an easy job, and I'm not saying it's necessary. Dwayne Johnson charms his way through his thinly structured character by appearing someone with heroics written all over him, that you may have your eyes the entire time following him as he saves both his family and the world. Carrying such responsibility would, of course, give way to making stupid and. brow-arching decisions (like when characters take pauses to have tender moments, cry, hug, and play the emotional blame game, in the middle of what could be an apocalyptic doom), and you would be incredibly happy laughing about such preposterousness, while also thrilled, watching the characters defeat the impossible. But its hard to appreciate such effort of putting emotional touch on the characters when they rarely go in congruence with character development.In the end, the film is nothing but one powerful quake that has just passed by before abruptly ceasing to exist. What is left after drowning entirely in the imminence of cataclysmic dangers and horrors of apocalyptic annihilation, is a feeling of voidness. SAN ANDREAS' greatness is as seismic as any cgi-packed disaster movie can be, and it's epic in such way, but it hardly leaves a sense of emotional satisfaction, making it a forgettable entry to the disaster category. 6/10",San Andreas

Just watch it for yourself without biases. It's actually quite fun to watch. The ""big one"" finally hits as the long-overdue San Andreas fault goes off (hence the film's title), triggering a huge earthquake. LAFD pilot Ray Gaines (Dwayne Johnson) and his estranged wife Emma (Carla Gugino) must head north in his helicopter from Los Angeles to rescue their daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario), who is in San Francisco. However, San Francisco is in for another beating - and the largest quake in recorded history.The movie is quite exciting, with an excellent plot (and no, the plot was NOT forgotten). The actors do a good job. The film has a good sense of humour (essential in a movie like this). And, above all, the special effects in the film are FANTASTIC. A definite must-see.",San Andreas
220,BillSims28,Five-Word-Review: Brainless Visual Jingoism; Utterly Uninteresting.,2,7 November 2015,"I really don't want to say much about San Andreas, Hollywood's latest disaster flick, starring Dwayne Johnson, straight off his Fast and Furious acting success, alongside Carla Gugino (Spy Kids) and Alexandra Daddario, of True Detective's first series. There's not been a good (I use this term lightly - I mean ultimately stupid yet enjoyable) disaster film in my opinion since Roland Emmerich's 2004 piece, The Day After Tomorrow. Yes it's really just rubbish, but I love it, just like Independence Day (1996). However San Andreas is nothing more than offensive crap. I really loathe to say anything positive about it, but fine, the visual effects are effective. Though the whole point of this film is tricking audiences into thinking that they're still impressed by CGI. The real denominators of the audience may be able to enjoy this. Now, the rest. With the risk of seeming too Kermode-like, it's utter bile. I've never seen The Rock's appeal - I don't hate or love him - and San Andreas does nothing to add to his appeal. There aren't any characters in this film. At several points I just started thinking: ""Who is this? Why should I care about anything happening?"" And it's true. No one has any personality to them above generic stereotypes. The plot (save the child) is hardly original but it clearly can be used enjoyably when the director knows it's silly and tongue in cheek. It's like someone read The Dummy's Guide to Making a Disaster Film, then put in an earthquake and a vaguely popular actor and that's San Andreas. Every line is so idiotic one can quote what's coming next before even hearing it. (Without saying Ghostbusters, guess what comes after the line ""Who do we call?"" It's ""everyone"", if you've never watched a bad film.) Throw in a couple of risible jingoistic shots like the American flag waving amongst the wreckage, but minus all the cheesy charm of Independence Day, and you get this tripe. It's got every trope, from the notable actor (Paul Giamatti) playing a nonsense-spouting scientist, to the cowardly human villain amidst the natural destruction, all the way to a forced romance. If you've managed not to see this yet, then don't. I love films which are so bad they're good, like Independence Day. I also like sometimes switching my brain off to enjoy some fun and action, like Avengers: Age of Ultron. But this will literally drop your IQ by watching it. Insultingly awful, shoving absolute twaddle in out faces and reaping hundreds of millions in return. 19/100.",San Andreas
221,slayerjmk95,Johnson Elevates This Fun and Intense Disaster Film,8,7 June 2015,"Whenever a disaster movie is released, it's generally welcomed with open arms as ""escapist"" fun; a movie that you can just sit back and watch unfold without depth. But, then there are a select few that elevate above your average disaster film. San Andreas is one of those. It's still not without its absurd moments, but there are very few that push believability. The biggest one is actually the opening sequence, of which involves a girl's car flipping down the side of a mountain (repeatedly), and then becoming stuck between rocks, an the young girl survives even without her airbag deploying. After that, things take off in a great way.San Andreas follows Dwayne Johnson's Ray Gaines, an LA Fire Department pilot who must rescue his daughter after she becomes stuck in San Andreas during a catastrophic earthquake, of which is discovered too late by Caltech seismologist Lawrence Hayes (Paul Giamatti). Surprisingly enough, Brad Peyton's direction here is a superb improvement over the family movie Journey 2 with Johnson, showcasing brilliant effects with heart-pounding disaster sequences that shock and awe. Johnson's performance here might actually be his best, as he offers great dramatic depth as a broken father, haunted by a tragic past. Alexandria Dadarrio was also surprisingly good as his daughter Blake, who had grown accustomed and looked up to her father's life-style, even embracing certain rules and tricks. The script was good, but nothing spectacular, other than Johnson's somewhat clearly deep and thoughtful dialogue (a touching scene between him and his ex-wife, portrayed by Carla Gugino). The visuals were some of the best this year, and never seemed lackluster. Andrew Lockington's score was suitably epic and evocative of a horrific event depicted in-film.San Andreas is a truly surprising and welcome summer blockbuster that strays away from being generic, but not too inventive either. The movie is greatly saved by strong performances of the main cast and smart direction, of which is a good step forward for Peyton. Certainly a must-see on the big screen, not sure about 3D though, as there weren't many pop-out moments.",San Andreas
222,MovieJunkie1976,A lovely disaster,6,5 June 2015,"Before the hallmark of special effects carried film into its current form, modeling was a dominant aspect of film. In the 1970's Hollywood was obsessed with the disaster film. Films such as Earthquake (1974) and The Towering Inferno (1974) were the best elaborations of this piece of movie history. That is until now , that San Andreas(2015) is released.These films are simplistic in design and great for producing thrills for the audience , which is why I am surprised still to this day that so few are done. You would think a vein of film that so well exploits modern effects would be used more frequently. Not to say that the few uses of disaster themed film such as Deep Impact (1998) or even Twister (1996)were not great effective uses of such device , just not as pure to the device as their character development was as strong or outpaced the disaster set around the story.This type of film for purity requires that the character interaction is in the background, something to bring harmony to the viewing audience so they are not just paying for an effects show. Though that is their primary motivation for viewing. San Andreas is a firm return to this formula.San Andreas (as the title should tell you) is the modern tale of the California ""Big One"" (Earthquake). We are slowly lead in to the situation by introduction of the rescue team lead by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. In the midst of some shaky domestic affairs is called into service after a massive quake in Nevada.However as Nevada shows us the party is just starting.This type of film really only requires that you have an individual who keeps the plot rabbit on track thus holding the audience suspension of disbelief in check. Paul Giamatti (Lawrence) was an excellent choice and single handedly kept this critical area working. The acting is this movie is a pass for all.The Direction is tight everything about this movies broad subject and theme is packaged neatly by director Brad Peyton , who owes that good fortune to scriptwriter Carlton Cuse.The disaster itself is pure fun , the kind of sit back and enjoy destruction that has seldom been seen outside of it's 1970's heyday. With the exception of young children this movie is perfect for almost any audience. Yes , there's blood , and there are some pretty graphic on screen deaths but nothing you would not expect from a scenario such as this in real life. It also has sparked interesting discussions of the nature of survival and civility something I am certain is a good thing today. This is great summer film , and a great excuse to be in an air conditioned theater with cold snacks on a 90+ degree day.Note: If you pay close attention you will see there is a moment in this film where ""the Rock"" is not on screen. I think Dwayne Johnson did a good job in that scene of reaching the character's core emotion.Three Stars(of 5.)",San Andreas
223,Kingkitsch,Not so rock-steady,6,11 November 2015,"Who doesn't like the Rock? Or Dwayne Johnson? Or whoever he's calling himself these day? 'Murica loves the Rock! Everyone. So let's get this out of the way up front. He appears to be a very nice man under all that beefcake, but he's not much of an actor. A disaster flick like ""San Andreas"" is tailored around his meager skills as a thespian. This worked for Arnold, Van Damme, et al. We don't care much about character development as long as things blow up, fall down, or are threats from outer space. Dwayne makes all the right faces here, but the paper- thin plot doesn't do much to help him on the road to an Oscar.1974 gave the world ""Earthquake"" in Sensurround. Lots of booming bass to shake your brain into a coma and the eternal cheese of Charlton Heston. ""San Andreas"" has neither the gimmick or Heston, just a lot of expensive CGI that looks like 99% of the other effects-laden flicks out there. This is why such films were invented in the first place. We want to see a whole lot of gnarly destruction and maybe a few famous faces getting killed in gnarly ways for the price of a ticket. The only really famous face here is Kylie Minogue, who gets flattened after maybe two minutes on screen. Everyone else in this B-flick is unknown, so we can't care about them because the screenplay won't allow it. Five characters escape death over and over here, but you won't really care. The ridiculous factor ratchets way up on the WTF scale as the Rock and his estranged wife go after their daughter in the midst of the destruction of Southern California. Evidently, the Rock can commandeer and pilot anything with a motor. The credibility factor in both circumstance and luck presented to the viewer is pretty much a take-it-or-turn-it-off scenario. NO ONE could survive major quakes, a helicopter and plane crash, a tidal wave, and falling skyscrapers so often. Still, the Rock manages to do so while attempting acting and saving his daughter after she drowned by looking upset and giving unconvincing CPR. Still, you watch. Your curiosity has been piqued. You still have popcorn. You wonder where all the other people affected by the earthquake have gone. You groan as the American flag unfurls behind the Rock as he intones ""Now, we rebuild"". This is a four star time- waster, but I'll give it six because, well, the Rock. Mindless and forgotten almost immediately once seen.",San Andreas
224,captainmike-michael,An Intense Disaster Film,7,6 June 2015,"Disaster films are expected to have the same type of story development but this replication of 2009's massive ""2012"" has a stronger and slightly more emotional family dynamic that helps a bit in the chemistry between the characters and their respective performances. The film in a much smaller scale of destroying part of the US with earthquakes and tsunami, finds its success that not only Emmerich is the only director who should monopolize the genre. The outstanding quality, eye-popping CGIs, stunning visual effects of disruption, good shots of cinematography of the disruption, thrilling challenges for survival and powerful scores by Andrew Lockington are on par with ""2012""; even the theory discussed in the film might seems erroneous but not entirely foolish and ridiculous. While it repeats the same mistakes - lacking of awareness and precautions on natural disasters, the spirits and the energy of the people to help each others during hard times is one of the most inspiring element that keeps engaging with audiences which is not found in other disaster films.",San Andreas

When he is flying the helicopter or ""Helo"" as he calls it, they don't fly like fighter planes. The film thinks they do but whatever!

227,ian1000,Pure Entertainment,8,29 August 2015,"Anyone expecting a similar movie to ""The Day After Tomorrow"" will either be disappointed or, as in my case, hugely relieved.Featuring superb CG, witness the disaster that overtakes California and The Hoover Dam.Amidst all this, witness the casting disaster of the Welsh Bloke as a slimy new boyfriend of The Hero's ex-wife.Then witness the casting oddity of that girl with large breasts that we all watched in ""True Detective"" in 2014, playing the student daughter of The Rock. Sorry honey, you do not look 20, and this site says you're 29. It's almost as bizarre as the 30+ Maggie Grace playing Liam Neeson's 17 year old daughter in ""Taken"". Almost.In short, a cheesy predictable script but an all action family tale set against the backdrop of the largest quake in history. Just enjoy it.",San Andreas
228,dutchs-1,"2012 meets Planes, Trains and Automobiles",9,23 June 2015,"Well, helicopters, cars, light planes and boats, anyway, all stolen. The film opens with Professor Lawrence Hayes of Caltech (Paul Giamatti) lecturing a class on earthquakes. Giamatti pulls off the frumpy style of a middle-aged professor in one of the better portrayals of a scientist I've seen on film. Then we see a teenage driver in the hills above LA committing just about every unsafe driving act in the book, only to be knocked off the road by something not her fault - a rockslide. The amiable hunk Dwayne Johnson pulls off a tricky chopper rescue to get her out of the jam. Back to Professor Hayes, who has been told of an earthquake swarm near Las Vegas and heads off with an assistant to check out a new scheme for predicting earthquakes. You have to either have a historical event or some new predictive technique because how else are you going to have foreshadowing? A Magnitude 7.1 earthquake hits, demolishing Hoover Dam and the bridge nearby, and killing the loyal assistant. First of all, you can't specify the magnitude of a quake in progress, and second, Hoover Dam in this film must be made of adobe because a Magnitude 7.1 quake wouldn't touch the real thing. Hayes soon learns that his instrument network is predicting much larger events. Dwayne is in the air when the quake hits and his estranged wife calls for help. Well, in a disaster, you have to start somewhere, so why not. Then they get a call from their daughter, who is trapped in a collapsed building in San Francisco. So Dwayne and his wife head off to save her. With tens of thousands of people needing help in LA, one of the LAFD's skilled pilots takes a much needed rescue chopper to San Francisco to save one person. In real life that would be good for a firing plus a trip to San Quentin. They get as far as Bakersfield when the chopper conks out and they crash into a building. Bakersfield is being looted by the most politically correct looters you ever saw, and one has stolen a truck to carry his loot. So Johnson steals the truck a second time. They get a hundred miles or so and are blocked by a chasm across the road, so they steal a plane. They can't land in San Francisco, so they bail out, then when they realize everything is blocked by rubble, they swipe a boat. Meanwhile the daughter has been rescued by a smitten stranger. The family's likely rendezvous point, Coit Tower, is blocked by fires, so the two groups are presented with the puzzle how to find each other. Tsunami, container ship flips end over end and takes out the Golden Gate Bridge, daughter and friend trapped in flooded high-rise, parents frantically looking in the flooded streets, dramatic life-saving.If power is out everywhere, how come every time a light pole comes down, there's a shower of sparks? I thought California had strict earthquake codes, so why do all the buildings collapse like dried mud? (You can say it's an earthquake if you like, but they looked like controlled demolitions to me.) It's fun and the kaleidoscope of disaster elements keeps it moving frenetically. And if you want a strong female character, daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) carries it off. She paid attention to all the things her firefighter dad told her. She's the one who knew to use a land line to communicate, what supplies she might find on a fire truck, and how emergency radios work. And her new male friend gives her credit for it. When Dwayne thanks him for being there for her, he replies it was more like she was there for them.",San Andreas
229,dongillette1,An Action Film - Not A Political Sentiment,10,30 August 2015,"Been reading some of the reviews from non-US reviewers on here and it seems they've got the wrong idea. This isn't a USA chest- thumping film, it's simply a mindless action flick and it succeeds brilliantly at that. If you're expecting something that makes you ""think deep,"" or something that stimulates conversation, forget it. But what you get here is a solid, 100%, no-apologies-necessary action movie that rivals any of the Die Hard series for nail-biting excitement. The CGA graphics are pretty damned good, the cast is pretty damned good, the ""science"" is pretty damned good, and the premise is pretty damned good. When I saw it was ""The Rock"" in the lead, I almost passed, but he did a fine job--as good an action hero as Sly Stallone, Arnold, or that cheesedick Bruce Willis.

It's about Ray(the Rock), he's a rescue copper pilot and when an huge earthquake hits California, you will see Ray and his family trying to survive this disaster. First off this movie shows that the rock can carry his own movie and be great In it. The bad thing is that the rock is one of the few good things about San Andreas. The visuals are good but at some times you can see bad CGI. Some of scenes are breathtaking and need to be seen on a big screen. The acting is good by everyone. If the rock wasn't the star of the movie, it wouldn't be a good movie at all.The Rock is just a likable star. Overall San Andreas was a good disaster movie,with a good performance by the rock and great disaster scenes. You don't need to rush to the theater to see this but it also wouldn't be a waste of your money.",San Andreas
232,blufrog49,Earthquake Meets Titanic Meets Posiedan Adventure Meets Towering Inferno,7,16 June 2015,"OK, first I did NOT see this in 3D. Second, I give Dwayne Johnson a 10 just for showing up. I could look at him all day. And he has turned into a pretty decent actor. In this film , his character shows us not only his physical attributes, but his ability to drive/fly just about anything. I really expected him to commandeer a cable car, but sadly, that didn't happen.Having lived in both LA and the SF Bay Area and experienced 2 of the biggest quakes in CA history, I can say the film made me a bit uneasy, but it was also fun to recognize so many landmarks (and be amazed how the characters got so quickly from one place to another, defying speed records).The CGI was terrific--and scary. The opening scene, which has little, if anything, to do with an earthquake, was especially riveting. As for the rest of the film, as exciting as it may be, we all knew how it would end. The coincidences just seemed, well, TOO coincidental. Perhaps the most unbelievable part was zipping around SF in the speedboat--would there not be debris and buildings just under the surface? No one should drive that fast in an area like that, but hey, it's an adventure film.Oh, and did I mention The Rock is a 10?",San Andreas
233,thomas-w15,"Great visuals, that's about it...",5,5 June 2015,"Hard to fall asleep in this one. There is maybe ten or fifteen minutes in the whole movie where some sort of action isn't happening. Earthquakes, tsunamis, landslides, buildings collapsing, and of course, more earthquakes. That is what we were promised and they delivered. Sure, the movie seems really unrealistic at times, but at least they advertised exactly what is actually in the movie. Although the acting could have been done by anyone really, the CGI and earth-shattering action is enough to at least have fun while watching San Andreas. What I mean by unrealistic is mostly things that you would expect. It would be impossible to actually just pick up some random boat and drive it all the way over a tsunami while dodging a humongous cargo ship that for whatever reason is coming right at you. Or after a tsunami does devastate a city and leaves the whole city flooded, it would be extremely difficult to drive a boat straight through the city because of the untold wreckage that would lie in front of you. There are a lot of other gaps in logic with this flick, but I knew what I was walking into and it came as no surprise to me watching those gaps. I will say this, Dwayne Johnson a.k.a. ""The Rock"" has turned into a box office draw in the past couple of years. Whether it is his charm, his silverback gorilla sized body, or whatever, people like to see him on the big screen. He did a decent job in this movie. To be honest, the role could have been played by anyone as long as they were muscular enough which may be the reason why Dwayne Johnson was cast. But, the role did not require any acting, or any of the roles in the movie for that matter, but still the whole cast did a good job at the roles they were given and no one was terrible. Now we come to the exciting parts, the action. Mainly talking about the earthquakes and tsunamis sequences. This movie kind of reminded me of an earthquake version of The Day After Tomorrow. I do not want to ruin the story of San Andrea for anyone but the plot is more or less the exact same just switching out an apocalyptic storm for the biggest earthquake in recorded history. It was impressive to see exactly how an earthquake would completely level a city. Getting a visual of an entire city being hit by an earthquake like it is a little town built by legos is nothing short of extraordinary. Everyone will at least enjoy the visual side of what the movie has to offer. Does San Andreas have it's faults? Without a doubt, but it is still fun to watch. I recommend you see San Andreas either in theaters or on DVD, but it will probably be more fun to be see in theaters. For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com",San Andreas
234,AliceofX,Exciting Action,6,30 June 2015,"The film begins with a scene of a careless driver who seems to have no regard for her safety and well being, or that of others. If you were in the mood to search for deeper meanings in a supposedly dumb action flick this is almost a subtle introduction to the story. The film's disaster earthquake that wrecks everything could be taken as symbolic for Ray and Emma's divorce and the damage that the separation of families does to children. That said, this is about as deep as the story goes. As is typical of action movies the action takes the front seat instead of the plot and in San Andreas it is just exciting enough to make you ignore the plot weaknesses. If anything San Andreas could have done with less unnecessary back story and cringe worthy dialogue. Particularly the worst part would have to be the Malory Talk where it gets all dramatic as Ray is talking with Emma about their dead daughter. It is just so out of tone with the rest of the film. And of course I did not think for one second that Blake was actually going to die.Overall San Andreas is an enjoyable action flick that is fun to watch but nothing too special that you would have to rush to the cinema to see it.",San Andreas
235,SweetWilliam63,The Fault In Our Stars,5,13 February 2019,"Wouldn't even waste a review on this movie except I couldn't resist the catchy headline. Those of us who grew up in the 70's remember when disaster movies were all the rage. (Towering Inferno, Earthquake (in Sensurround!), Airport, Posiedon Adventure, etc) In those days before CGI the special effects were part of the reason to see the movie. Today, I've become so used to sensational effects that it's hard to get a ""meh"" out of me. What's missing here is characters that we care about, atypical storylines and solid suspenseful moments. (Moreover, after 9/11, watching crumbling buildings and terrified crowds just seems ironic. We live in a world where the unimaginable is all too imaginable.) Dwayne Johnson is essentially beefcake throughout. Paul Giamatti is wasted. Alex Daddario is watchable but not enough to save this overly cliched snoozer.",San Andreas

238,tvspace,"Watchable, ridiculous, all-American histrionics",3,28 May 2015,"I'm feeling generous -- I'm going to give San Andreas a 4 out of 10. That's on account of some impressive special effects work, and the fact that as terrible as the script is, it doesn't devolve into the kind of non-stop chaos that too many current big summer movies resort to. The film is at least watchable in some basic sense.Now, to the story: I described the plot of this movie -- before seeing it -- to a friend and I'd say I got 80% of the details correct. That's how formulaic and predictable these kind of movies have become: the family patriarch will rescue his beautiful family while the world burns around them; we end with their triumphant reunion, somehow along the way forgetting that, you know, millions of people have died so the good fortune of one upper middle class American family isn't really all that potent of a tonic for what we've witnessed.At its heart, a movie like San Andreas is a kind of ideological propaganda: the supremacy of the all-American nuclear family over any chaos the world can throw at it. This film mixes in a strong dose of patriotism (from Dwayne Johnson's heroic status as an Afghan War veteran, to the unfurling of the American flag from the broken Golden Gate bridge at the end) to supplement this family-over-all message.However, the problem here is that Johnson's Ray Gaines actions are not patriotic. Far from it, they are a grave dereliction of duty. As a Los Angeles Fire Department rescue helicopter pilot, his job is to serve the greater good. Instead he selfishly rescues his estranged wife from the tony penthouse restaurant where she was having lunch, and then, even worse, the two of them head to San Francisco (in an LAFD helicopter!) to save their daughter. It should go without saying that a Los Angeles fireman's first job is to assist Los Angelenos in the aftermath of a 9.1 Southern California earthquake, not to steal one of our taxpayer-bought helicopters and fly it to San Francisco. (I would have loved to have been in the writers' room when they hammered this plot point out.)Indeed, the essence of ""patriotism"" should be that Ray trusts San Francisco firefighters to stay on duty and do their job, while he does the same in Los Angeles. If every firefighter in California behaved like Ray Gaines, no one would be rescued because all the firetrucks and helicopters would have been racing across the state to various colleges to rescue (exceptionally well-endowed) daughters.I'd like to see a movie about the thousands of people who died in East Los Angeles while Ray was flying north up the Central Valley for several hours.It's funny -- on the way into San Andreas I heard the guy in front of me say, about Mad Max: Fury Road, ""I wasn't too impressed... it was more of a political, women's empowerment kind of thing."" How many people come out of San Andreas and recognize that it is even more political than the Mad Max film? The difference is that this is a propaganda film for all-American values (patriarchy, family, physical work -- i.e. the latter is contrasted with the step-father, a designer or architect, who is shown to be morally repugnant), while Mad Max has a message that subverts and provokes those assumed values. I dunno -- I'm not very political but it seems pretty funny to me that only the subversive film is recognized as being ideological. Think about it.Great special effects, though!",San Andreas

240,LiamCullen6,Typical Disaster Movie,6,6 June 2015,"This movie is everything you would expect from a family-appropriate (PG-ish rated) disaster movie. All of the action and typical clichés are present:Key protagonist with something haunting him from his past that drives him? Check.Split-up family that gets reunited through the disaster? Check.Cheesy romance? Check.New step-father that is easy to hate and entirely antagonistic? Check.Seemingly invincible main characters? Check.Occasional stabs at humour? Check.Occasional curse-words and innuendos to appeal to adult viewers? Check.Near-death-experience for one of the characters only to be saved at the last second? Check.Nerdy scientists that predicted the whole thing? Check.You get the idea. It is very cliché. So don't expect to be blown away if you've seen any disaster movies before (2012 springs to mind as a good comparison). However it is by no means a bad movie - quite the contrary: the visuals are stunning, the acting is relatively well done and helps make up for the average script, and the film somehow manages to create an atmosphere of excitement despite the clichés.Nevertheless, I found myself leaving the cinema not quite feeling full enough. As if to say, ""oh - is that it? It ends like that? Really?"" It just didn't quite seem like an appropriate ending. Almost as if it was lazily and hurriedly tied up at the end rather than being finished off nicely.So if you're desperate to see a disaster movie or an action-packed film for the whole family, go watch San Andreas.

244,CrisMovieCorner,"The Rock, massive earthquakes, Daddario and her eyes, what more could you ask for?",6,2 September 2015,"It feels like wherever you turn today in the movie world The Rock is showing his face, which is not a bad thing he is a very enjoyable actor I find. I have been enjoying his work since I first seen him in ""The Mummy Returns"" when I was 11/12 already loving him from his time in WWF.Disaster films usually tend to all follow the same tropes, San Andreas is no different in that aspect they follow the tropes, ""damsel"" in distress, children in danger, over the top destruction and comedic retorts in deathly situations. Even though it buys into all the usual tropes, it doesn't take away from the film, director Brad Peyton chose to focus on characters as well as the destruction, without trying to make the film something it isn't. It stays very true to its destructive route which is the real reason we all watch these type of films and it does not disappoint in nearly destroying the entire San Francisco Bay Area.The films relies a LOT of CGI as you would expect, for the most part there is a some beautiful visuals, I found some of the effects to by abysmal like something you would expect if watching a film from 2/3 decades ago. Plus the use of poor green screens is eminent in many scenes, they stand out in their awfulness in scenes in which Johnson and Gugino's characters are sailing through the city. There are some incredible visuals though, none that I will be specific about as to not ruin them for viewers who are yet to see them.The ensemble cast of Johnson, Gugino, Daddario, Guffard and Giamatti amongst others were a nice combination, let's be honest though it's an action film getting ""The Rock"" to star in it is like avoiding Christopher Mintz-Plasse like the plague, it just makes sense! The entire of the cast were great in their roles, my only complaints come from getting people to put on accents that they just don't sound right at all Guffard has a wonderful accent his attempt at American was poor, the same I found with Parkinson and Johnstone-Burt, what is the point in getting an Irish kid and an Aussie to play accents not natural to them. It is something that I have always been annoyed by, especially when the accents break constantly throughout film. My other ""complaint"" isn't really a complaint, it is the fact that whenever I see Giamatti I think he suits NO role yet still delivers with every role, my brain just doesn't understand it! ha. All that being said, I will watch ANYTHING that has Daddario in, not only is she a brilliantly talented and incredibly beautiful, I may actually be in love! I'll have to stop here on Miss Daddario before this turns into a love letter aimed at her.The film was very well paced, it doesn't get itself caught up in trying to tell us the story of the world while this is all going on it. It is straight to the point of being a sect of America, plus the action really gets under way within the first twenty minutes when the Hoover Dam comes crashing down. From then on the film has a nice pace and focus on both characters and the real reason we're all watching to see stuff crumble! Overall, the film was a thoroughly enjoyable popcorn flick, the film is stunning to look at for the most part and the characters are enjoyable in their own way. However the story is very predictable as you would expect from many films within this genre, but that doesn't make the film any less enjoyable let's be honest is it really possible to not enjoy The Rock being The Rock? He's a total bad ass in pretty much everything he does, this is no exception. While the film will not be out winning awards, it will give you a solid two hours (nearly) of enjoyment without really having to concentrate on the story. This is my first ever .5 rating, it wasn't a 6 but it wasn't a 7, but I don't really know why the film just wasn't either so I had to switch up ratings a little.",San Andreas
245,chubbydave,The Worst First Respoonder,5,29 September 2017,"San AndreasThis is a movie about ""The Big One"", a huge earthquake in California. It focuses on The Rock who plays the worst first responder in the history of first responders. In the beginning they show him saving a young woman from a dramatic car accident without any regard to the spinal injury that she would have had to have suffered in such a horrific accident.Then when the earthquake hits, instead of reporting for duty to coordinate rescue efforts, he abandons his responsibilities and steals a rescue helicopter and uses it for personal use. He's just awful, and I cringe at such a horrible person this character is meanwhile being thankful for the many, many unselfish first responders who help people in need.But it's an exciting movie with a lot of special effects so it's fun to watch if you can stand this evil main character.",San Andreas
246,trooper5783,Great 3D popcorn fun!!! IGNORE ALL HATERS!!!,9,22 July 2015,"I wasn't gearing up to see this movie. However, my aunt told me that it was really good, and I MUST see it, and prepare to be dazzled and frightened. But after reading the mixed feedback, I was skeptical about my opinion, yet listening to the reviews on here saying its a great disaster flick. And, what do you know, it was a fantastic movie! Granted, the plot is generic Michael Bay formula that steals lots of elements from the DreamWorks movie Home(which I didn't like that much), and the scientist subplot doesn't mesh well with the important majority of the story, but those were small and the only flaws with the movie. Do see it in RealD 3D if you plan to see it, because I was jaw-dropped by the visuals and the outcomes of the destruction(I also jumped at 2 or 3 pop-out effects). The acting is phenomenal, I really was intrigued by the actors fitting the characters very well(particularly Paul Giamatti, The Rock, and Alexandria Daddario). Unlike most action movies, the characters are lovable and you really do care for them. The CGI and practical effects are amazing here, they don't rely too much on either medium to be considered unrealistic. Overall, see San Andreas and ignore all the haters who are just hypocritical and judgemental of great movies.",San Andreas
247,John K.-2,"Never mind the plot, enjoy the effects",7,6 June 2015,"I popped out to see the film ""San Andreas"" tonight. I rather enjoyed it, and managed to stay right through to the end (first time I've done that since ""Fury"" last year) -- and was only mildly distracted by the woman next to me who was already snoring when the film started, and didn't stop till it was over. (Her husband only jogged her when the snoring got loud).To enjoy it, you have to be able to suspend disbelief. Right from the very beginning, when we were asked to believe that the offspring of Dwayne Johnson (African-American) and Carla Gugino (Italian-American with hair and eyes reminiscent of Sophia Loren) is a girl with the bluest eyes you've ever seen (Alexandra Daddario, Italian/Irish/Hungarian/German/English-American), believability flies out of the window. If you look at a list of the top disaster movie clichés (like this one: http://www.wow247.co.uk//9-of-the-worst- disaster-movie-cl/), then you'll see well over half of them in this film. And, like many disaster movies, Mr Scott is ignored: you can actually change the laws of physics, particularly towards the end of the film.Having chosen to suspend disbelief, the best ways of enjoying it are actually to hope the main characters get out alive, and to enjoy the special effects. I particularly liked the apparent aerial shot of the land oscillating up and down like the waves of the sea. (I hope I haven't spoiled it for you by revealing that the film includes at least one earthquake).It's not going to give you any deep insights into humanity or real life. But if you're in the mood for some big loud disasters, it's worth a night out.",San Andreas

It follows basically the same rules, movies such as The Day After Tomorrow or 2012 (or any other disaster movie coming from Hollywood for that matter) went ahead before. The daddy has trouble with mommy and the kids are not close when the drama starts. Therefore daddy goes on an impossible mission to save the kid, explosions and destruction follow his path and no matter how troubled the world may be... there is always time for a love story in between, right? The CGI looks cool though and the sound is just fine. You will find yourself surprisingly caring a lot for the main chatacters and San Andreas is a perfect popcorn blockbuster.

What were they thinking?Do all the people involved in putting this together not think that the viewers have some sense of understanding of realism and how things work and don't work?It's a great movie if you just want something that has plenty of action and carnage, a couple of hot looking chicks- let's face it, neither Carla Gugino or Alexandra Daddario are hard to look at, but don't go into this with high expectations!I mean where to start? Ray steals a government owned helicopter- it's not his, it's owned by his employer, the LAFD. He then flies it on his one man mission to save his family, with no questions asked by anyone in authority. He then uses a hover function that doesn't exist to effect his own one man rescue. I was seriously waiting for him to undo his shoelaces and start to weld up the steel structures MacGyver style to stop them from collapsing!!!!!He can skydive- and tandem as well!Then we can outrun or out-manoeuvre a rapidly approaching and humongous tsunami!Oh and to really get the blood boiling, a reference is made to most discredited earthquake survival technique- the Triangle of Life!

251,philneil,10 Things I Learned,6,22 November 2017,"...from San Andreas.1. Buildings, roads and dams will crumble & fail just seconds into an earthquake.2. You only need to be a couple of feet off the main structure of a collapsing dam to be safe from imminent death. 3. Bursting a car's rear tyres will unpin a passenger trapped by an interior car seat.4. Once rescued, aforementioned passenger will be just fine despite being pinned by their legs so tightly they could not move.5. Cell phones will be useless but somehow landlines will still work.6. It is possible to just walk into a small aircraft hanger and make-off with a plane.7. Someone needs to dramatically shout ""TAKE COVER!"" at the onset of an earthquake, you know - just in case it wasn't obvious by all the shaking and falling debris.8. The actors trying to pull off an English accent obviously went to the Dick Van Dyke School of Acting.9. Climbing a 1000ft tidal wave whilst avoiding an oncoming shipping vessel dropping it's heavy cargo is totally achievable in a pontoon.10. Kylie Minogue did not need to be in this movie.6/10 for the special effects. Leave your brain at the door.",San Andreas

I was actually surprised that all the rumbling and crumpling started barely 10 minutes into the movie. Then it lasted for the rest of the movie. Forget the character development or plot, just destroy everything for 2 hours. That basically sums it up. I'm wondering, is anyone really impressed with these special effects? I just felt tired of it. Whatever the little plot it has... is stupid. This cool rescue chopper pilot only cares about his family. Doesn't give a damn about saving public. And he's supposed to be a hero? One thing this movie has going for is all the cleavage. And I'm not talking about the cleavage of the San Andreas fault. They sure captured those cleavage perfectly.This is shameful below 3rd class garbage.",San Andreas
254,Arcturus1980,Very entertaining,9,9 July 2015,"I was strongly advised against seeing this movie by someone who considers it sheer stupidity from A to Z. Fortunately, I went anyway. It is easily my favorite natural disaster movie, an enjoyable subgenre that hitherto has not wowed me.I don't much mind that San Andreas stretches scientific realism until it yelps for mercy, because to my way of thinking it comes down to intelligent, likable characters, an engaging, well-paced storyline, a good helping of humor (not that it takes much for The Rock and Paul Giamatti to amuse me), a ton of perilous action with solid special effects, and nice sprinklings of pathos amid the mayhem. The Rock and Carla Gugino as separated parents achieve a tenderness that is not a joke, however much it may be lost on those who maintain a self-satisfied, preconceived idea of San Andreas as a mindless, popcorn movie.Though there were no real surprises, it was not for me a by-the-numbers experience. San Andreas has a Spielbergian sense of wholesome integrity and more depth than it is given credit for. Many would write off Ioan Gruffudd's megarich character as a two-dimensional cad, but not only is his behavior entirely conceivable under the circumstances, Carla Gugino's character is all the more fleshed out and sympathetic by association. If all hell didn't break loose, he would have remained good boyfriend material by any reasonable analysis. That aspect interests me.I found it very entertaining overall.",San Andreas

I know that no one watches this sort of entertainment in search of a meaningful plot, or even intelligent characterisations. However, the most annoying thing about this movie is that the plot recycles the same irritating plot device that I have seen and criticised in numerous other movies. *** spoiler alert *** A rescue worker, supposedly employed to rescue people and save lives, goes off on a private rescue mission, first to find his estranged wife, and this his daughter. But wait, the city is falling into ruins as he is doing this, and it doesn't seem to occur to him to use his helicopter to help anyone else, even on his way.I could mention the ridiculous plot, the coincidences, and the two- dimensional characters.

259,RocketeerFlyer,A Rocking (sorry) Disaster Film with a few Faults :-),8,17 October 2015,"SAN ANDREAS is another film I missed at the Cinema. The trailer looked like fun so unusually for me I bought the BluRay from new with the 3D version included (I'll return to that later)I found it to be a very entertaining disaster movie, it took parts of ""EarthQuake"" (obviously) along with ""The Poseidon Adventure"" and ""The Towering Inferno"" mashed 'em together and created a fun and brilliantly OTT movie.The disasters within this one come think and fast and for the most part the special effects are very good indeed.The film starts with a great scene featuring an obviously careless young woman who seems to get away with every driving mistake you could possibly make, the subsequent rescue attempt of this lady is THRILLING with The Rock (sorry Dwayne Johnson) piloting a rescue helicopter and it could be argued that this is the standout scene from this film.There's a neat scene with the Dam, a Rescue attempt of his wife and the mass destruction of SF (I pray I will never hear of such news, although I believe that fact within this film is correct and that a big one along this fault is now well over due)Check your brains in at the foyer or at the kitchen (as you make up the drinks and popcorn/snacks) like others I cannot believe those that say there is no real story...maybe the real thinking man's/woman's disaster film has yet to be made? (although ""Interstellar"" had a decent stab at it) but this is your POPCORN ENTERTAINING DISASTER FILM sort and it works a treat.Are there faults? yes and we have seen them before in numerous other films, for example...1) The parents are splitting up and have filed for divorce...so can you guess what happens next?2) The rich guy that wins the heart of the wife (well he's nice at first right?) but he's rich and has everything to live for but then the destruction hits...So what do you think happens to him? yup.3) Ray (Johnson) and Emma (Gugino) seemed to be the perfect family but as I say they're awaiting divorce, they have one beautiful daughter (Alexandra Daddario who is a truly beautiful young actress) but had another taken from them...So can you guess what happens to her? yes she's in danger but I wonder if she'll die? I ain't saying but take a guess? (In Poseidon, Earthquake and Towering back in the 1970's they were not afraid to kill off characters we got to know well throughout the films) hint: they cheat.4) I truly LOVE our flag here in Britain (The Union Jack) but you never see the British films unfurling ours like this at the end of a film, it may be draped over a coffin of a British agent or something like but never unfurled as it does here towards the end of the film. Tongue in cheek? I hope because it is awfully cheesy.Now I list the above 4 because they're so obvious, have been done before (you roll eyes a little) but it DOES NOT spoil the entertainment value of this film.The team up of Dwayne Johnson and the still beautiful Carla Gugino again works (I liked them in the ""Race to Witch Mountain"" remake)8/10 for me but this was because I saw the 3D version and for a change it actually made a difference (it may not have been made in 3D? but the conversion was terrific) If you have a 3D set up then I would recommend you pay the extra and enjoy the destruction in 3D...it's worth it, otherwise a good 7/10.Oh and if you do buy it on Blu Ray then do try to get one with the Wonderful Lenticular 3D slip-cover...Rescue Helicopter among the destruction is eye candy.",San Andreas
260,pendenquejohn,This is the typical action movie for you...,1,18 September 2015,"The title says it all. This is the typical ""stupid"" action movie for you. All the stereotypes were served on a delicious looking faux-gastronomic like dish, and, to believe that I was going to see something of note. So, far from being the case.First, the video game boats, helicopters and airplane. It is quite amazing how Alexandra Daddario's father avoided falling stones, disastrous life threatening situations with the most perfect God given skills and talent time and time again. I could not believe in many of the scenes how incredible this helicopter guy was at manipulating his engines in between falling buildings and how he was able to climb a tsunami at 90° avoiding yet again what seem to be the end.That scene had to be one of the most ridiculous and stupid one I've ever seen in an action movie. So inconceivable and unrealistic that they could not even have found a logical end to it since it skips directly to the sequence where they're looking for their daughter.How thy were able to navigate with such ease with their boat in the crumbs of what seemed to be the biggest disaster the south part of America had ever known. In that respect they could have done much better than that.How was the Alexandra Daddario able to make Art Parkinson's laser pointer functional when they were in water ? All these are just a variety of nonsensical scenes that the movie delivered time after time.Second, the whole scene about Alexandra Daddario's situation relative to death was just completely overblown and forced like as if they were trying to draw emotions from the spectator. This lasted for a good couple of time in the movie and turned out to be particularly annoying.The facts that main protagonist always found a way to escape the most life threatening situations made the movie even more annoying in regards to what was being thrown at them.The fact that the earthquake only appeared in specific situations was actually quite disturbing. And, it was easy to anticipate the difficulties that the main characters would have been confronted to.More specifically on the acting, Dwayne Johnson's acting I found to be quite stale and soporific. His emotions were really non existent and it was quite difficult to believe in the role that he tried to embody.From a technical standpoint, some of the catastrophe scenes seemed completely fake, especially the tsunami where you could see that this was a not-so-well 3D processed material. Most of the times, I found the see to be completely fake and unrealistic.This movie really over-painted the main characters as superheroes in front of a super-great catastrophe but realistically ? It seems like they would be always the first people to find some sort of idea when the rest 'normal people' would be running crazily around and dying - ; extremely predictable like always.Conclusion, this movie is really everything I kind of distaste about action movies, hence why I have been boycotting them the last few years. The script is alway in favor or the main protagonist but this time it was SO conspicuous that it was ridiculous, agonizing and pathetic.",San Andreas
261,fabiolpinheiro1993,"Good, but it feels like a 90s simulation program instead of an epic disaster film",7,23 June 2015,"I'm a sucker for disaster movies, but i didn't love San Andreas. The film has a very cliché narrative and characters, but this is not my biggest problem with the film, because i wasn't expecting more. The dialogue is very unnatural and cheesy, but the likable cast smooths the lines. My 2 biggest problems with the film are the visual effects and how bland it is. The film has the most perfect premise for a perfect disaster film, the san Andreas fault line, but despite some big destruction the film wastes the vast opportunities to make a huge epic disaster movie. There's so little, and what we see is done in the most bland way possible. The film could easily have no director, since there's no identity to the film, there's nothing do indicate there is someone doing it. The action is plenty, but there's nothing new or exciting about it. The destruction is wasted on so many levels, it's like watching a simulation made by a computer of what an earthquake like this would be. The camera shots are like an entire city being destroyed and you pass in a jet plane at high speed through the city, and for a 2 second window you can see the destruction, and thats it. Many scenes could have been epic, but i guess the director just said, why more? 2 seconds are enough!As for the visual effects, they seem good at times, and terrible at others, the water for example is just terrible, for the most time i never believed i was watching more than cgi. There's nothing new, it's like hey we have an a idea lets make it and get it over with. It has a: been there, done that feeling from beginning to end. Don't get me wrong, i enjoyed the film, despite its flaws, its a funny movie, action packed, its good. But thats it, is just good, almost falling to the level of just satisfying when it could be a lot better. They could have made so much more with the premise, find original ideas, but in the end it feels nothing close to cinematic, it has the feel of a 90s simulation program.

Even though the film is a big disaster film cliché, it never fails and run out of surprises and I appreciate that. Just when you thought it's over, there comes another wave of events that will make you swear repeatedly. And the impressive special effects will just make you swear even louder. I should take note of the film's introduction, I might say, that was unexpected and it surprised me completely. A girl was driving on the road and she was inattentive, she was fishing her phone out amongst other things and many cars passed by and you would think that she was going to get hit by those cars (because that's what usually happens) but I was wrong, something much bigger, or must I say massive, hit her and it wasn't any vehicle. So thumbs up for that big shocker, way to start a movie! This film won't get a very high rank in the drama department but it has just enough to poke your heartstrings and tear ducts. It's a well-executed disaster movie; you don't need to look and ask for anything more.

Special effects were great and did take the movie to a whole new level of awesomeness.Now what really annoyed me during the movie is the inability of the Rock to act and they keep on hiring him for more movie roles. His face never changes when he's happy, sad, angry, joyful ... The rest of the cast was OK, Ollie character is just boring and the movie can do without.These are some points really annoyed me during watching it:Ollie character who supposedly is 13 years old, acts like he's sexually frustrated all the time, I mean common he's a child. The plot of the movie was very obvious and cliché; I saw that boring ending coming a mile away but as I said, I love its special effects and that's why I really wasn't affected by all negatives, I was able to get over them and enjoy the CGI non human part of the movie.",San Andreas

Well, here it is again - only with slightly different wrapping.",5,6 June 2015,"If you're already familiar with (or a fan of) any of Roland Emmerich's fare, then this film should be no different to you. This is the sort of movie that only works if you're willing to suspend your disbelief (just trust me on this), allow your intelligence to be insulted (the movie spouts off a lot of safety tips that anyone would know), and turn off your thought processes. And although there are some quiet moments throughout that allow you to connect with the characters on a deeper level, many of the disaster scenes in this movie is just POINTLESS. It goes out of its way to show PLENTY of people we never seen before struggling and dying. I get that that is one of the genre's main tropes, but this movie does it SO MUCH that I just got pulled out of the shock and awe (and slowly became desensitized to it all).Another thing that really annoyed me was just how CONVENIENT (if that's even the right word to use) everything was. It's pretty much expected from the disaster genre, but I know for a fact that there are GOOD disaster films where their screenwriters managed to keep things interesting by throwing some twists along the way just to throw off audiences (see: The Towering Inferno).The visual effects are, for the most part, pretty good - but there are some scenes where you can tell that the VFX artists failed to make their green-screen work look as *believable* as the rest of the movie. It doesn't take an eagle-eye to spot which scenes I'm talking about (pay close attention to the third act).Dwayne Johnson gives a surprisingly sympathetic performance as a father/husband going through some tough family affairs, yet also retains his action-hero status as a well-trained rescue pilot. His daughter (Alexandra Daddario), is not your typical annoying 'child' either. She plays a much more involved role that boasts some considerable importance to overall plot!All in all, I found San Andreas to be a fun popcorn flick. The movie annoyed me much more than it absorbed me, but at least I got some adrenaline from the earthquake scenes (plus, Dwayne Johnson wasn't half bad in this movie)!",San Andreas

Nothing special except for the visual effects and sound, which i might add was a bit too over the top at some points.The actors did a good job portraying characters we've seen over and over again. Dwayne Johnson has his moments and glimpses of great hidden acting ability still not fully exploited. Maybe he should do a cop movie patrolling the streets of L.A. or Miami.If you've seen 2012 and enjoyed it like i did, you will enjoy this movie too although the characters in both movies are bit too similar that sometimes it's quite frankly annoying.

A great depiction of a mind boggling earthquake,followed by a tsunami. This actually really frightened me into thinking about the serious,loss of human life and devastation this type of disaster would cause if it were to really happen,bone chilling to say the least.There were great performances by all actors and actresses e.g. Dwayne Johnson as an outstanding helicopter rescue pilot who gave us a preview of his skill during an opening scene depicting a nearly impossible accident rescue. Paul Giamatti fit very well as the seismologist scientist. The family drama offered a more personal slant,making it a great ultimate survival story and suspenseful movie.A definite must see for fans of movies like 2012 and Day After Tomorrow,this action-packed film will knock your socks off.This film should,without a doubt be nominated for some type of award recognizing the phenomenal ""over the top"" special effects.",San Andreas

There is one interesting acting performance, that of Paul Giamatti who does a passable stock permanently hysterical scientist trying to warn the world that the end is nigh. Dwayne himself does what he does best, though whether it would pass as acting is another matter. As a professional fireman he is obviously able to hotwire cars, steal boats, fly aircraft (fixed wing and rotary) and tandem parachute but being convincing as he ruminates about his (other) daughters death is clearly a skillset too far.But the script is excruciatingly ludicrous - to the point of embarrassment. The daughter is peculiar looking and the baddie who has the audacity to take up with Dwaynes soon-to-be-though-we-all-know-she-can't-really-leave-Dwayne-ex-wife is as leaden and lumbering as the object that finally presents him with his come-uppance.But the English lad (actually an Australian - Englishmen would never have teeth that white) who takes up with the peculiar looking daughter ? Without doubt the most ridiculous acting performance I've seen in a while - and the teeth ? The one lasting memory I shall take away from this film is rows and rows of huge, glacial white sets of tombstone teeth that jump out at you from the screen in a way that Jaws never did. Dwaynes match his gleaming helicopter pilots helmet The patriotic flag waving at the end was truly nauseating.",San Andreas

276,ufster-2,"Say what you want, it's entertaining",7,6 March 2016,"For a catastrophe survival movie, San Andreas hits all the marks. The build up is not overly indulgent as to suffocate the rest of the movie by stealing air time from the action and drama scenes, refraining from draining the audience's attention span with minute details that would serve no real purpose but as contrived plot ties or references later on. We learn all we need to know about what is going on with the characters by the 15th minute and from there on it's a roller coaster ride. Acting is surprisingly decent, especially from Dwayne Johnson. He firmly establishes himself as a go-to guy in big budget action movies, further solidifying his rise to the Hollywood A List. Generally, delivery is on par with the level of acting one should expect ideally from this genre. Visually it is stunning where it matters, dominated by heavy CGI yet the post-catastrophic scenery feels natural and believable; even as you watch some of the most outrageous depictions of an earthquake struck San Fransisco. Seriously, a warship wedged between two skyscrapers is as out of place and wacky as it gets, but they pull it off. Pacing is like clockwork, tick/tension and tock/release always on the beat. Dramatic scenes are neatly placed to move the plot towards where it's supposed to go, the climatic action and the action hardly ever disappoints. You get micro-crisis after micro-crisis within the overarching context of the macro-crisis and even the macro-crisis is delivered in sequences that help maintain the fast pace along the ride. If the roller coaster metaphor works here, there is initially the slow rise up the hill, the subsequent free fall followed by some fast turns, climbs and descents and then there are a few big vertical loops, corkscrews and batwings scattered along so that the audience is constantly kept on edge. Formulaic is almost always an adjective that is used to berate a movie but in this case, sticking to the formula pays off for director Brad Peyton and the writers.",San Andreas
277,trvlers-77920,3.8/10,3,2 June 2015,"The question isn't whether ""San Andreas"" is ridiculous — of course it is, it's a disaster epic about earthquakes devastating California — but rather, how effective is that ridiculousness? Oddly, the answer is: not very. For a big, splashy summer blockbuster about destruction and carnage starring Dwayne Johnson, ""San Andreas"" is surprisingly dull. There's a repetitive, relentless sameness to the action without much scale or suspense. A massive quake rocks the Hoover Dam or downtown Los Angeles or middle-of-nowhere Central Valley or the streets of San Francisco. Buildings topple, concrete and glass rain from the sky and frightened masses flee in terror. Then a series of aftershocks starts the process all over again. Then the quakes trigger a tsunami, which levels everything once more. But director Brad Peyton rarely builds to these moments to maximize their potential tension. A powerful image like a gigantic wave flipping over a loaded cargo ship, snapping the Golden Gate Bridge in two as if it were made of Legos, doesn't wow us as much as it should. It's just one more event within a litany of mayhem. Peyton, who previously directed Johnson in 2012's mediocre ""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island,"" smothers all the action in thick, glossy globs of CGI to such an extent that there's an emotional disconnect. We are detached from the stakes here; the fact that millions of people probably die and major U.S. cities are decimated feels like an afterthought, like collateral damage. The Big One, which we in Los Angeles have prepared for our entire lives, basically serves as a catalyst for Johnson's character to reconcile with his estranged wife and become a family once more with their 19-year-old daughter. The normally charismatic Johnson is stuck in a ruggedly stoic role as Ray Gaines, a Los Angeles Fire Department helicopter pilot. At the film's start, it's clear he couldn't be more capable or commanding at work, but his home life is a wreck. His wife, Emma (Carla Gugino), has just served him divorce papers as she prepares to move into the Beverly Hills mansion of her new boyfriend, a slick and insanely wealthy architect named Daniel (Ioan Gruffudd). Ray had been looking forward to driving his daughter, Blake (Alexandra Daddario), up the coast to college, but Daniel takes over that part of Ray's life, too, by offering to fly her there instead in his private jet. Even before the first hints of a rumble, it's clear that the earth ripping apart will bring them all back together. But first, Ray must commandeer various vehicles in order to swoop in as Super Dad. It's like ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles,"" only with a catastrophic body count. First stop is the roof of a Los Angeles high rise, where Emma had been lunching at a luxurious restaurant with Daniel's disapproving sister (a barely-there Kylie Minogue). (Peyton does stage a long and impressive tracking shot through the shaky chaos here, though.) Then, the two head north as a team to find Blake, who's trapped in a limo inside the collapsed parking garage at Daniel's San Francisco corporate headquarters. (So much for his skyscrapers being structurally sound). But as Paul Giamatiti points out as Caltech seismologist Lawrence Hayes — the lone voice of reason and a welcome source of beautifully understated melodrama — the only thing to do in a situation like this is pray. Giamatti is the only person here who finds any subtext in ""Lost"" co-showrunner Carlton Cuse's script, giving his rather unimaginative lines more gravitas and camp than they deserve. Speaking of camp, Johnson gets one brief, shining opportunity to showcase his comic abilities when he unleashes a groaner of a pun in the middle of AT&T Park, the San Francisco Giants' home, even as the city is collapsing all around him. ""San Andreas"" actually could have used more of that instinct. If nothing else, acknowledging its own over-the-top nature provides a much-needed variance in tone. Mostly though, this guy is all business. There's never any concern that Ray won't save the day. He's The Rock. He's a behemoth. Although, in his quest to rescue Emma and Blake, he allows untold thousands to perish, even though it's, like, his job to help people. This being a PG-13 movie that aims to appeal to the widest possible audience, ""San Andreas"" couldn't be bothered with realistic stuff like suffering. But the film does deserve credit for the strong female characters it offers in Emma and Blake. Thanks to all those years they spent with a quick-thinking and resourceful firefighter in the family, they not only know how to keep themselves alive but rescue others, as well. A pair of British brothers (Hugo Johnstone-Burt and Art Parkinson) not only survive thanks to Blake but also learn some first aid and emergency response tips. Folks in the audience can learn a little something, too. For example: The perfectly coifed television reporter (Archie Panjabi) who'd been interviewing Giamatti's character dashes for the doorway at the first seismic shift. He tells her not to do that — to get underneath a sturdy table or desk and hold on tight instead. So ultimately, this mindless spectacle is most effective in its traces of realism. How groundbreaking is that?",San Andreas

It harkens back to the classic Disaster Movies of the 1970's like Earthquake, Towering Inferno, Posiden Adventure, and others. Others are saying it was just too cheesy. Well, that's what it's supposed to be. If you went into it to find a great drama, well, you watched the wrong movie. It's a Disaster Flick, plain and simple. The only Acadamy Award given to this one should be Special Effects. They were EPIC! When my wife and I saw it (in 3D in the theater) we were on the edge of our seats (my wife especially so, and she didn't wanna see it).

283,cloud_nine,Good Popcorn Movie,6,30 May 2015,"Bottom line, this is a good action movie that happens to take place within the framework of a huge earthquake. Turn off your brain for a couple of hours and enjoy. Plot: the Rock and his estranged wife struggle to rescue their daughter in San Francisco following The Big One. As in all action movies there are certain rules that don't apply in real life. After the quake hits in San Francisco, the daughter is trapped in a car located in a garage two floors below street level. Her cell phone works! She is able to call daddy in his rescue helicopter over Los Angeles which has also been hit. (It is at this point where the audience began to laugh and make funny comments.) Daddy has just rescued his wife and though they are in a rescue helicopter and people in LA need saving, they take off for SF. We do get to see the obligatory destruction of the ""Hollywood"" sign.Daughter is rescued by a young man she has just met. There is debris in the garage but no dust in the air. And though they are in a ruined garage beneath a ruined building, there is enough light to see what they are doing.Daughter's new boy friend has a shard of glass embedded in his thigh. When Daughter pulls it out, I expected a geyser of blood but no. Nothing. She wraps a cloth bandage around it and off they go. Later, they kiss.Fast forward. The Rock and wife are in a rubber pontoon boat in the bay when the tsunami hits. They are able to ride the boat up the crest of the wave and over to the other side just in time for the same wave to take out the Golden Gate Bridge. They easily maneuver the boat through the debris filled sea water which has covered the city. Funny how the boat is not shredded by the debris and nor is the propeller broken off.Soon the Rock is swimming through tsunami water inside a building to find his daughter. There is plenty of light and they both hold their breath for a Very Long Time.Once they are all safe and rescue operations are under way, someone asks ""what do we do now?"", the Rock says ""now, we rebuild."" This is how the 1936 movie ""San Francisco"" ended. ""San Andreas"" borrows parts of ""Earthquake"" (1974), ""The Day After Tomorrow"" (2004).....well, you get the idea.",San Andreas

Maybe she just didn't want to do this movie. Dwayne Johnson's acting deserves a best actor nod compared to her.Now, on to the movie. Just like War Of The Worlds with Tom Cruise, this movie was ridiculous in the fact that the main characters always escaped death within split seconds. Everybody within inches of them dies, but they are always spared. Some may accept this because it's a movie, but it becomes a little much.In summary, I could forgive all the ridiculousness of this movie and enjoy it for what it's worth, save for the miraculous last second saves and the very below par acting from Carla. I give it a 6 because it had nice effects including sound, but the movie went exactly as anyone would have predicted.",San Andreas

If anyone went into this disaster film with ""The Rock"" as the lead, expecting coherent storyline and originality, well you're probably new to movies.That said, here are the things I liked about the film...1. The Rock (how can you not like The Rock?)
2. The CGIThat's about it.What's wrong with the film?Although I wasn't expecting much, the formulaic approach is so cliche by now that it's embarrassing to see The Rock do it.1. Super hero level nonsense
2. Unrealistic sequences
3. Geography problems throughout
4. The laws of physics cease to exist in the Rock's Kitchen (but can you smell what the Rock is cooking?)
5. Tsunami when the quake was inland (and headed toward the land at that)
6. The insane amount of time Blake (his living daughter) was without air after drowning (based on what they did, it should have been about 10 minutes if you include him grabbing her, getting her to a dry floor, her laying there while the Rock had a monologue with the Aussie with the English brother, getting her on the boat, getting out of the building and then giving up on her after trying CPR unsuccessfully. Then a heart touching moment, then super Rock brings her back from the dead)
7. The fact he gave up on her in the 1st place.8. Needing to see her drown before he cared enough to actually break the barrier
9. Rich man bad cliche

Within 15 minutes I told my other half that , the parents about to get a divorce would not, the daughter missing after a massive earthquake would be found, the new partner of the mother would be killed and everyone would live happily ever after. And they did. The most formulaic, generic, dare I say lazy kind of film making?

288,IanAJohnson,"This film was cheesy, but entertaining.",5,8 June 2015,"San Andreas is a disaster film about the largest recorded earthquake happening along the San Andreas Fault. There are three sub-plots used to portray different aspects of the earthquakes. First there is a small team of seismologists at Caltech used to explain why the earthquakes are happening and what to expect from them. Next, there is Ray Gaines, a soon-to-be divorced helicopter-rescue pilot and his soon-to-be ex-wife as they look for their daughter in an action-packed sort of way. Finally there is Ray's daughter, Blake, and a couple of survivors as they try to escape Los Angeles with more of a survival focus. This is an over-the- top movie and that is exactly what it needed to be but in that respect it missed something, though. They constantly mention that the largest earthquake ever recorded was a 9.5 on the Richter scale (a scale that has been obsolete and replaced since the 1970's by the way), but the earthquake in this film is a 9.6. Why not make is an 11.3 or something because the effects of this earthquake were much more destructive than the one in real life (and yes, I am aware of the logarithmic scale that theses models follow)? This is the kind of movie where you shut your brain off and just watch the colors on the screen oblivious to what the colors represent. Granted, the colors are pretty and the C.G.I. is pretty good most of the time. When I was starting to watch this movie, there was an introduction sequence with some girl in a car that fell off the road. The C.G.I. was awful and the motion of the car defied so many physical laws that Isaac Newton rolled over in his grave. It got much better after that, but it was not a good first impression. Just about nothing is original here. A lot is taken from 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow, with a tiny bit taken from Twister. Like most disaster movies there are sections of the film dedicated to character development so that you care for the protagonists. In this film that fails incredibly hard. I didn't care about anyone; not even a little bit. It's not that these people are unlikable, its just that every word that comes from there mouth is the cheesiest and most clichéd dialogue a person can possibly write. A large chunk of the dialogue is just a person asking a question followed by a long pause and an ambiguous and unhelpful answer. ""Who do we tell?"" ""Everybody."" ""Where are you going?"" ""To get our daughter back."" It just goes on and on. Overall, the film is fun, but incredibly shallow, inconsistent, predictable, and cheesy.",San Andreas
289,Nightopian-Raposa,Goody goody,8,4 March 2020,"Unfortunately, this not an adaptation of Grand Theft Auto, but rather, a disaster movie from the studio behind Into The Storm.The Rock plays Ray Gaines, a rescue helicopter pilot for the LAFD who lost a daughter but is lucky to have the other one (Alexandra Daddario) love him very much... despite the fact he and his wife (Carla Gugino) aren't together anymore. Gugino is now dating Reed Richards from the '05 Fantastic 4 film. Too bad Mother Nature has other ideas, as the notorious but also real San Andreas Fault has finally shifted, causing the biggest earthquake the state's ever seen. And they've seen a lot. Now, Gaines and the ex must rescue Daddario after Reed chickens out, not knowing that she's on her own adventure with a handsome boy and his little brother.The effects, brought to you by Brad Peyton, are hands down... ok.

290,hamass-mujadid,"The Day After Tomorrow, 2012, World War Z—Somewhat Likable. San Andreas—Utter BS!",4,26 May 2015,"Equivocal. Obvious. Balony. Couldn't be any worse. The underlying principle behind all the caring-family-gets-past-everything stupidity is the hierarchical system of art that Brad Peyton sadly lacks. And sorry to say, such apocalyptic depictions are getting far worse than they used to be, or maybe people have started to like worse. Dwayne Johnson is not shoddier than he is supposed to be; he does what he's expected to: make his appearance, save the day, make some money, and there you go. And Carla Gugino's acting is always uncalled-for, so that's up to her usual standards, which are pretty below the line.San Andreas depicts the same rotten-tomato story of an ordinary yet exceptional man who risks everything and ventures into dark-holes and ""plot-holes"" to rescue people, including his daughter (who is miles from appearing so.) Where the whole ""effing"" world is collapsing and tumbling to the core, Mr. Shoulders (Ray) has the guts to get past everything without a single scratch. So that's how it goes.I know I'm supposed to be writing a movie review, but this movie is just pathetic, so much so that I'm constantly deviating from my goal here. As with Fifty Shades of Grey, in which Ellie Goulding's Fifty Shades of Grey totally had me, the only thing I found captivating in San Andreas was ""California Dreamin'"" by Sia—what a song that is, I mean totally. But even that song's congeniality to the movie is limited. They ruined it in the movie trailer, not the song, mind you, but the whole clip was just not so captivating. And now, they ruined it in the movie. It was better off away from this unaesthetic, mainstream, untalented piece of work.They just do that for the box-office, don't they? Last year it was Godzilla, and this year it's this. Hiring a famous cast, writing a visually entrancing plot, and releasing it in 3-D. Get lost, seriously! I watched Mad Max: Fury Road a couple of weeks ago. Its genres were almost the same. But the way they executed it is beyond words. Miller totally pulled it off. And here, it was just a money-grabbing, regular movie with a rigged ending. Brad Peyton has paved his way for many other visual-stuns, all of which will get slapped by critics, and lauded by ordinary audience, who value collective conscience related to reality more when they are watching a movie. C'mon guys. Beat yourself with baseball bats at home; don't come to the cinema if you want to learn a life lesson. It's not a Nolanized version; it's customary, lame, underdeveloped, and sorely lacking in moralism. And Brad, you want to teach a life session, get us ready for a destined apocalypse? Write a damn article in The New York Times. Don't waste our money, and cinemas' popcorn on something this stupid.Action and thriller movies constitute the essence of liveliness of cinemas. Drama-movies suit lessons. You don't get your backpacks ready by watching a 3-D action film that saves the actor/actress and kills everybody else. Why doesn't the apocalypse harm them? Why don't they get killed, or injured, or even remotely affected by the physiological and neurological tragedy that just occurred. At the end of everything, film-makers then raise their cameras from helicopters at 1000ft and try to prove how much they feel for everybody. You don't expect positive reviews only on the sidelines you've readied your earnings for. And I must not be criticized and see people ""not finding my review useful"" only because I didn't find anything good about the movie except its indication to a foreseeable dilemma, which is not really a critic's cuppa-tea.So in the end, San Andreas is a mundane Armageddon itself. It depicts itself, so to say. It's a catastrophe—an utter disappointment. 2012 had the same plot, World War Z is also remotely linked to it, and so are several other movies. With the exception of World War Z, which was unusually likable, despite the zombie-factor, every other such movie is aesthetically a disaster, a work of a philistine, and sick-and-span-ily misleading. Folding down, folding up, crumbling, disassembling, wide-ranging affect-zone—the skyscraper effect, the hulking cruiser, jack-and-jazz buzz, ireful seawater, smashed-up barricades, barrages, dams, overturning, falling apart, dropping down into the crux, Paul Giamatti's teensy-tiny deliverance, and Alexandra Daddario's lion's share—*giggling*—are all I've liked about the movie. When you're in the cinema, these things rock you up. But at the end of the day, let's face it, the movie sucks badly!",San Andreas
291,ameliek81,A lot of useless story lines,3,26 August 2015,"I'm all for stupid/cheesy/lame action movies, but this one seems to have intentionally not put any effort into this at all.The whole story of the dead daughter is just annoying and doesn't add to the action. I find it actually takes away as it's useless. Also, the whole divorce between the 2 parents. Again, it doesn't add to the story simply distracts from the action. As does the moms boyfriend. We could have done without him. I mean honestly, if he hadn't been in the movie, if the dead daughter storyline was left out, there'd be no difference. The characters would still be the same as would the events. All these ""distractions"" I found to be annoying to the point where I couldn't enjoy the movie. Also, a lot of eye rolling dialogue. For example, after Blake is rescued from the car at the beginning, she and the 2 brothers are running in the streets, buildings falling apart all around them, they've seen people get crushed by debris... Ben (the older brother) asks Blake ""why do you wear 2 of the same necklaces?"" really? I mean, really? groan.If you don't mind something incredibly predictable with no surprises at all (I'm just an hour into the movie so maybe they'll end up all dying!)then go ahead.

It is loud and the sound is every well done. The music is not a John Williams score (granted there are some scenes that would have benefited from it keeping the tempo and storyline going) but it is nothing to right home about. Special effects are great and realistic, especially the quick ""pull focus"" that occurs. The actors perform their parts very well, script solid, director got the physics perfect and just over all a well crafted movie.There is some a particular distraction when Alexandra Daddario runs that is obvious, which I leave up to you to discover.

294,hjbuhrkall,At bit too generic,5,25 April 2016,"I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy watching this, but perhaps some of my enjoyment came from accurately predicting so much of the dialogue and events of the movie (this can in some cases be amusing). The Day after tomorrow, 2012, Deep Impact, Armageddon, Twister, Volcano, The Perfect Storm, The Core, and the list goes on and on. I have watched them all, and my recipe for a disaster-movie is as follows: You need the following ingredients: The ""hero dad"" from a dysfunctional family who was recently separated from his wife because of generic hero-reasons. His daytime job has a vital role for his survival in the following events (firefighter, cop, engineer, specialist, scientist), and hence qualifies him as the protagonist. The ""kid"" who at some point gets in the middle of the unfolding disaster, and then needs saving from the hero-dad. Luckily the kid have learned a lot of survival skills from the dad, so before being rescued, the kid has to save a few other characters of the movie (preferably a stray child). The ""scientist"" who pretty much single-handedly predicted the magnitude of the coming events, but nobody would listen to him/her, because of the absurd scale of his theories. When the world now is in peril, the scientist is accredited with endless power to command with both the media and army alike. The ""scientist-aid"" has to be young, naive and good-hearted, and die under tragic circumstances so to fuel the scientist motivation for solving the situation. The ""Stage"", needs to be a densely populated area, any metropolis in either the US or Europe will do. other great cities (e.g. in India or China) can be added, but only so they can be leading up to the real disaster.The scientist and his aid is just on the brink of a breakthrough in whatever field they are studying, and at the same time the kid is traveling to the midst of what is to become a disaster-zone (this can be college, going on a camping-trip, or just hanging out with friends). Meanwhile the hero-dad is out doing his bad-ass job, or having an argument with his ex-wife. When the disaster strikes, the scientist-aid is tragically killed off, but at the same-time this provides the final data needed by the scientist to prove his theory. Before an official warning can be issued all hell breaks loose, and now the media and government has no choice but to trust the all-knowing scientist. While all this is going down, it becomes apparent to the hero dad that he needs to save their child, and at the same time mend his broken marriage. When the disaster is over, the hero-dad is once again back with his wife, the scientist gets a girl, and in this specific case even the kid manages to get a new boyfriend in the process all is well.Mix in a bowl, and add plenty of mind-boggling effects of entire cities being demolished. Inset random scenes of people being destroyed by the disaster, but remember to leave space for the important ""family-bonding"" parts throughout the movie. Season with one or two scenes of main-characters barely escaping dangerous situations, and at some point during the end, you need to have a main character ""die"", so he/she can be revived again.",San Andreas

Events take over however, as a huge earthquake measuring a massive 9.1 on the Richter Scale, tears open the San Andreas Fault and with it many of the cities, along it's path. Ray manages to save Emma, from the roof of an high rise building, but his daughter Emma, isn't so lucky and finds herself trapped in a car with Daniel. Daniel decides to go and look for help and leaves Blake in the car. Daniel decides to put his own welfare above all else and abandons Blake to fend for herself. Blake's found by Ben, (Hugo Johnstone Burt), who's been interviewed for a job at Daniels offices and with the help of his younger brother Ollie, manage to free Blake. Blake manages to find a working phone and rings Ray, who immediately aims his helicopter at San Francisco. Things take a turn for the worse however, as the helicopter develops a fault, forcing Ray to make an emergency landing. Ray manages to steal a vehicle and he and Emma resume their race to San Francisco by road. They come across an elderly couple broke down by the road. The couple agree to give them the keys to a plane they own, if in return, Ray gives them the keys to the vehicle. Blake, Ben and Ollie, must find an alternative rescue point as their planned pick up point, Colt Tower, is engulfed by flames. On the ground, an early warning centre led by Lawrence (Paul Giamatti), predicts that the earthquake was only a prelude of things to come and advises the population to leave the city, as the largest quake in living memory is just hours away.",San Andreas
296,cuthbertjoel,"If you wanted a plot, you've come to the wrong place",3,18 July 2017,"I'm afraid the opening sequence of this movie sets the tone for the rest of it. Admittedly, some of the CGI within the movie is much better than the pathetic offering in the car crash scene, but there is still very little to offer unless you just want to see mindless explosions and buildings falling down.When watching this film, it was so hard not to compare it to others of the same genre (The Day After Tomorrow and 2012 were the two that sprung to mind). And, I'm afraid San Andreas never gets close to being anywhere near their standard (and they are hardly world beaters!) My main problems are that the character development is none existent which renders you totally ambivalent to any of the characters in the film. If they live or die could not have bothered me less. And also, the cheesy dialogue and overacting is something you've seen a million times before.For me, it is the poorest in a long line of disaster movies that tried to pin it's hopes on Dwayne Johnson, but I just didn't buy into him as this sort of character, so the film was flat from the start.",San Andreas
297,Sammy_Sam_Sam,Exactly what you'd expect from this sort of film...,5,29 May 2015,"The film starts with a CGI car falling down a CGI cliff in a semi- CGI world... I haven't seen a car crash like that since the Playstation 1, but the quality does get better from thereon. It's a disaster movie about some earthquakes and some people who are caught in some earthquakes. Some die, but some do not... makes sense. The Rock is the star and he is like a bald-headed action man who jumps from one vehicle to the next. He is incredibly strong and can hold his breath underwater for minutes at a time. He drives a huge black American 4x4 in immaculate condition, with the US flag on it. I kind of wished for once that the leading man would drive a nice little hatchback or a sensible family estate, but sadly not. And like a lot of leading men in disaster movies, he is troubled by something from his past and is in the middle of a divorce. Anyway, there's some more stuff that happens and then there are credits when it ends... nothing too unusual really. If you like inexplicably stupid films then I can't recommend this highly enough, because it has EVERYTHING. Good CGI, bad CGI, loads of extras dying in imaginative ways, a bumbling Brit who can't get his words out (I guess Hugh Grant was too old for the part), and Paul Giamatti. Some things I liked about the film were most of the effects, Paul Giamatti, and some interesting shots of the female cast. Things I didn't like were the script, the storyline, most of the actors, and I didn't like that I watched it in 2D when 3D would've made some of those aforementioned shots even better. To conclude, 5/10. It would've been 6/10, but the Rock missed the opportunity to wear a captain's hat while he was pootling along on his boat.",San Andreas
298,ghostjunk,Disaster Strikes Back!,6,11 November 2015,"Following the aftermath of a brutal and violent earthquake, a chopper pilot must travel with his ex-wife, against massive destruction, to rescue their beloved daughter.Dwayne Johnson may have started his career as a pro wrestler, but has clearly proved that he's got all the charisma, muscles, and talent to be a true modern-day action hero in San Andreas. Some critics are calling the acting one-dimensional but I'd have to agree to disagree. While there may be a predictable amount of panic-infused performances from our actors continuously running away from danger, San Andreas managed to surprise me with its emotional heft. This is where the film's true strength comes into play and saves it from reaching a level of mouldy cheesiness that not even a mouse could enjoy. What can I say? A little cheese every now and then never hurt anyone, or at least the inner kid in me tends to enjoy it.That being said, we may as well get straight to the obvious elephant in the room. Yes, this just another typical Hollywood blockbuster disaster thriller, and yes, the plot line is as clichéd as they come, but there's no arguing that it accomplishes exactly what it sets out to do, and that's entertain! I won't argue with anyone that there's also a lack of character development and some pretty far-fetched scientific elements present, but who really cares? Let's not forget that both Twister and Dante's Peak were criticized for the same things back in the day, but I didn't care then and I certainly don't care now because they're simply too fun not to enjoy. The same can be said for San Andreas, which is easily the best film of its genre to come out since the '90s and its jaw-dropping special effects and good sense of humour more than make up for its obvious shortcomings.The film also features one flawlessly choreographed continuous shot that follows one of our characters' struggle to escape the destructive force brought by one of the film's massive earthquakes. It's a 3-minute long scene that features over 50 actors, 8 locations, dangerous stunts and a great mix of practical effects and CGI that pulls you right into the action. It's hard not to be impressed and even a little inspired from such a realistic-looking and complex action sequence. It's just a shame they had to end the movie with such a corny, American propaganda-esque scene, but what can you do? At least the film wasn't based off any books or games, and isn't another godforsaken reboot.Unquestionably clichéd but equally fun, San Andreas is sure to disappoint most critics as a loud and mindless Hollywood flick. I am, however, confident that most audiences will have a hard time not enjoying this modern-day, action-packed disaster thriller. I suggest you recline your chair, crank up the surround sound, turn off your brain and just enjoy the ride!",San Andreas

This was good stuff! And then...it turned into a Dwayne Johnson rubber-stamped action joke. The cliches. The wooden dialogue. The predictable good guys and bad guys.

300,WaldoLydecker1,The Rock saves the World,3,17 August 2020,"Of course he will save everyone (living) who matters to him. He's the freakin' Rock? He can outrun earthquakes, falling buildings (in a helicopter, no less!), a tsunami, and God knows what else. When there is no real suspense, what does it matter how many perilously close calls the hero and/or his loved ones encounter? We know they're all going to come through stronger than ever. I guess I'm old-fashioned, but CGI effects, no matter how well done, just look phony to me. The destructions of L.A., San Francisco, and points all around and in between are quite spectacular, but the aforementioned CGI disconnect prevent any real sense of peril for any character that really matters. The one death with any emotional resonance occurs before the movie even begins. Paul Giamatti gets to emote directly into the camera, but even that seems fake and ham-fisted. And he may be the highest-paid ""actor"" in movies, but his major accomplishment is looking buff and tough while flying planes, helicopters, swimming inside a building, etc.",San Andreas
301,Smerdyakoff,An Above Par Disaster Movie,6,30 September 2015,"The disaster movie genre started in the 70s with such films as the Towering Inferno. They were usually ham fisted star studded turkeys. While the plot and dialogue in this one is pretty pedestrian, over all it is entertaining without being graphic or sexual, beyond the usual damsel, or in this case, his daughter, in distress. It is a good family film that serves up the action and special effects but keeps it grounded, albeit cheesy at times. Sure, the two English brothers who saved his daughter at first then she saves them is pretty schmaltzy but not too terrible. Add the cad of a potential step father who wimps out to save himself, in order to set up a possible re-union between the Rock and his ex, played by Carla Gugino, borderline cheese too.The Rock is so much a better action hero he-man type than his 80s predecessors like Stallone and Lundgren it isn't worth the comparison. Not that he is a great actor, but he has much better screen presence.In all, it is a good enjoyable disaster movie and an easy watch, and safe for the kids too",San Andreas
302,jen-lynx,A fantastic addition to a misunderstood genre,8,7 June 2015,"I'm going to be straight up here, I love disaster movies and the cheesier the better. ""San Andreas"" (2015) doesn't miss a note. It is absolutely gloriously atrocious. I loved hating the absurdity of it all, while simultaneously witnessing my worst nightmares. And it has ""The Rock"".There are several things I expect from a truly great disaster film, the first is Bad Science. Nothing says Bad Science like electromagnetic spikes in something or other used to predict earthquakes and thereby change the course of history from here on out, especially when such a power is used to predict the biggest recorded earthquake ever that stretches over 1000+ miles of California landscape! We also need some kind of compelling redemption story...the man who realizes he's been a dick all along and saves the day, or the quiet shy nerd discovering his inner strength, or the damsel in distress finds her hidden reserves...this movie has them all and more! We also need a bit of completely absurd ""parking spaces in front of busy restaurant"" moments. That is, those ridiculous, but perfect, synchronicities that only happen on film. Oh boy, does this film deliver! From flying helicopters with unlimited fuel to hot-wired pickup trucks just as the bullets begin to fly, to scoring the fastest boat in the Bay, this movie lands them all. Finally, we need to see stuff being blown up, leveled, destroyed, people fleeing in terror knowing they will never make it, and pure mayhem and destruction. What can I say, the Golden Gate Bridge is destroyed spectacularly once again.""San Andreas"" delivered a solid disaster film. It is not trying to be a great movie; it makes fun of itself, without crossing the border into satire. It is a modern day take on a classic, albeit often misunderstood and maligned genre. ""San Andreas"" might well see itself on my shelves some day.",San Andreas
303,VallejoDiego,Sorry if I hated on this movie bad. But it is my opinion (minor spoilers,3,10 June 2015,"Straight to the point. I didn't like this movie. It was so unrealistic and predictable. The action scenes with the quakes looked so fake most of the times and especially the beginning when the girl crashed and the car happens to flip over like 10 times so perfectly looked so fake. The acting by the cast was OK I guess but I didn't like Alexandra Daddario at times, even more in the car scene when she was stuck and her crying didn't look like her crying at all. Then when Dwayne Johnson at the beginning he ripped out the car door with his own hands was just so fake because no one can do that it doesn't matter if you're the rock. In the end I did not like this movie and didn't enjoy in one bit. So I give it a 3/10 because the whole movie was unrealistic and predictable. And for me this is the first bad movie I have seen as of 2015",San Andreas
304,johngraham1964,Not that bad,6,4 September 2015,People seem to hate this film but just accept it for what it is - a formulaic disaster movie. There's not much you haven't already seen in 'The Day After Tomorrow' (ooops there goes the Hollywood sign again....) but there are some neat special effects and inventive ways for people to get flattened by falling roofs/buildings/shipping containers... It was an enjoyable little romp and for 'us Brits' it was fun to see Kylie Minogue come to a grisly end (yes I know she's Australian but she's v famous over here). Don't expect anything deep and meaningful - the American film studios' fondness for saccharine endings is here as per usual) - but don't dismiss it so quickly either.,San Andreas
305,dgranger,A great paint by the numbers action movie that manages to avoid some clichés.,7,3 July 2015,"This movie is a great fun action film that did get me to feel for the characters only because I had taken a CPR class a long time ago and knew you have up to five minutes to resuscitate a drowning victim before brain damage or brain death sets in. That wasn't explained in the film. Otherwise, the action was fast paced, well shot, and the situations well explained. I am sure the science in this film is all correct. But however it it had an overall paint by the numbers feel to it where you never have a doubt they were going to make it out alive. It did manage to avoid the movie clichés like if their are two loving comical brothers in the film, one is going to die, or the black guy dies. It manages to miss several clichés but hits so many others.",San Andreas
306,pasa-2,Nuking the fridge every few minutes + uses all clichés possible,3,7 June 2015,"After watching the trailers my expectations were pretty low, but the movie managed to be even worse.What is too bad as it used many good actors I like and had good potential.The main problem is if fails to convince for a moment, all I felt was actors doing some abstract things in a safe room while CGI is painted in the background.Sure, in an event like this no official arms do anything but members of this family -- and while everybody just dies they even manage to meet. Conveniently finding all kind of vehicles on the road and as soon as getting into a clearing must face a serious obstacle the next moment just to pin them at the proper place for the next event and allow the next BS scene.I think it will be too much even for the US public that seem to bee responsible for all the IQ-halving films we get lately.

Every character was one dimensional and the fractured family saved by getting together in the face of the deaths of millions, a tired overused trope, was especially nauseating.
I don't know who were the lost people giving this movie a 10, minus ten is more like it. Did they work on the film? Lame. CGI, and not even good CGI, doesn't make a good movie. Especially one that has a shamefully weak script. It wouldn't matter how good the CGI was, it couldn't have saved this horrible mess.",San Andreas
308,luke5119,"A Good Disaster Movie, Nothing More...",6,26 August 2015,"In my years I've seen many a disaster film. Twister, Volcano, Dante's Peak, Deep Impact, Armageddon, The Towering Inferno, Poseidon, The Core and many others, even Charlton Heston's disaster classic from 1974 ""Earthquake"", which for its time was really something. Visually San Andreas is astounding, along the lines of 2012 I'd say it bares a strong resemblance. Dwayne Johnson I think in these past couple years has all but cemented himself in as an A List action star in Hollywood and has gotten as far away from his ""Rock"" persona as he possibly can. The only thing that turned me off about this movie apart from the cliché Hollywood ""yeah,..okay"" moments was the story. I think it could have done better following the lives of several groups of people suffering the quake's instead of just one family. I will say it makes a small attempt to connect you with other characters, but it's a pathetic effort to say the least. Everything plays out, well...pretty much how you'd expect it to play out from scene to scene. Even when they had the perfect opportunities to throw in a small twist here and there, they didn't. There is one scene in particular where one of the main characters is injured by a shard of glass that impales his thigh. They quickly make a tourniquet and carry him on the remainder of the film. At one point towards the end of the film one of the main character's, Blake decides to check on his wound. This would have made for the perfect twist to reveal that the shard of glass severed the artery in his leg, resulting in that characters death. Did they do that? Nope,...they turn it into a kissing scene. In all it's a good party movie watch with friends one time, but not one I'd watch every year.",San Andreas

San Andreas is all those things as well. The difference is, True Lies is almost a spoof. San Andreas is trying to be an action drama, yet is less believable than the spoof.Don't filmmakers use consultants or subject-matter experts? Did no one ask anyone who knows anything about... well.. ANYTHING to consult for this movie? During an opening scene, our hero helicopter pilot performs a 'tip the hat' maneuver to get the chopper into a narrow canyon and perform a rescue. How did they get out of the canyon?Our hero activates an 'autopilot' and leaves the controls of the helicopter to rescue our heroine. There ARE helicopters with a form of autopilot, but not THAT helicopter.In several instances, our heroes carry on a conversation in a Huey helicopter as though they were sitting in an idling Maybach. Our heroine, from a rooftop amid collapsing buildings, even yells at our hero who is inside a very noisy helicopter and behind a closed door... and he hears her.Our hero performs CPR on a drowning victim and performs rescue breathing before clearing the lungs of water.... on a moving boat.There's too much CGI. In our opening scene, a hapless victim's car goes over a cliff. Did the drive a real car over a cliff? Did they even drive a model car over a model cliff? Oh no. They created the scene through CGI with obvious non-physical results. It's pretty lame.Michael Bay has ruined movie-making. Now, every director seems to think that a great action scenes need to look like it was filmed as though the cameraman was on a pogo stick... on roller skates.... riding a tilt-w-whirl. There's a fantastic scene in the film Old Boy in which Old Boy fights off several attackers in a hallway. One camera. One long, long take. No shaky-cam. No whip pans. No flash cuts. The scene is brilliant, effective, almost haunting. Take notes, directors. The viewer needs a point of reference to see what's going on. If you tie a camera to a string and swing it around your head, the result isn't a great action scene.

Of course, coz if Plan A worked, the film would be too short.* ""Trust me, it's gonna be OK."" Yeah, do trust them...A lot of extreme, but silly scenes, such as riding a tsunami on a small motor boat while they were standing comfortably, just holding the boat rails with their hands, no safety belts, no helmets, yippee! Then a fabulous slalom between huge falling containers... Then a pilot flying around in state helicopter with no mission order, just for a joy ride.And those 100-storey buildings collapsing match models...And most of all, where are the authorities to face such a cataclysm? Of course, you see some police people and paramedics, but that is incidental.Still, I believe the most stupid part of this lame script is when they say ""People of San Francisco, leave the city immediately"" (or so). Do the writers have any idea about how it is to evacuate 800,000 panicky people when the next huge earthquake is announced to occur in the next minutes?""Who will you be with"", says the trailer.

He was so frigging loud and over acted the most part. LOL. Thats not even funny. And Alexandra Daddario, i swear to god she's a porn star in the making with those huge bouncing titties and blue eyes.

As far as this movie is concerned. You can skip this right from the beginning through how they maneuver a copter within the mountains is just banana's. I already had the feeling that this was going to get horrible as it progresses and i was right. Of course, his wife is always going to survive everything major that was going to hit her and dywane was always going to save her despite his copter getting f'ed up. And of course the daughter, she was going to survive too being trapped underground in a building while the fantastic duo somehow manages to save her while everyone else dies.The family values in this movie resembles the famous TAKEN, and the disastrous effects resembles somewhat of the movie 2012 which was horrible itself.

314,JasonKleeberg,From the director of Cats & Dogs 2: The Revenge of Kitty Galore,5,31 May 2015,"A movie with faults.There are varying degrees of disaster movies. They range from the utterly awful (2012, Dante's Peak) to the pretty entertaining (The Poseiden Adventure, Towering Inferno). When I plan to see one, my expectations are pretty tepid - I know it's not going to be high art, but I hope it'll be entertaining enough. I think San Andreas falls somewhere right in the middle.The story is simple enough. The titular fault line that runs from San Francisco to Los Angeles activates, causing the biggest earthquake in recorded history. A rescue pilot named Ray (played by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) goes on a hunt to rescue his wife and daughter.It's hard not to root for The Rock - not only is he the biggest action star on the planet, but he's a genuinely awesome person. His charisma is clear on screen, but it's a bit hard to take him seriously as a helicopter pilot. He's also apparently the worst rescue worker ever, because he takes his helicopter and flies 300 miles north to rescue one person instead of trying to help thousands of the city of L.A.'s trapped citizens. The rest of the cast is easily interchangeable - Carla Gugino plays his wife and Alexandria Daddario (Woody Harrelson's muse on True Detective) plays his daughter. The cast does pretty well with what they have to work with. The problem is, they don't have much.This script is abysmal. It's terribly predictable in the sense that whatever you see or hear on screen WILL come up again. Ioan Gruffudd is cast as Daniel, a villain (as if Mother Earth wasn't big enough) - his sole purpose in this film is to anger the audience. I think it would have been much more interesting if he was a genuinely good guy, having to help The Rock with the woman they both love. Paul Giamatti stars as ""time filler scientist"" in a story line that, if taken out, wouldn't have made a bit of difference. He's simply there to fill screen time and spew exposition on why earthquakes happen. Newsflash, we understand why earthquakes happen. Some kid stars as ""comedic relief character"", as you'd expect, along with his brother, who stars as ""contrived love story guy"", because we simply have to appeal to everyone. There were two other rescue workers introduced at the beginning that never appeared again, which was unfortunate, because I think they could have added to the story.That being said, we don't watch disaster movies for the story, do we? We watch them for the destruction, and that's where San Andreas thrives. Most of the CGI is fantastic - buildings crumbling, bridges collapsing, cruise ships capsizing - they all look amazing. There was only one scene, the opening scene of an SUV tumbling down a cliff, that looked awful. The rest was really good. AT&T Park folding in on itself was particularly satisfying. Being from this area, it is interesting to see a fictional version of your city being destroyed - a thought that's always in the back of the minds of Californians who have dealt with earthquakes before.If you're looking for high art, you won't find it here, but you can do much worse than spending a lazy afternoon with The Rock, but you can do a lot better. Go see Mad Max: Fury Road instead.Final Score: C-",San Andreas
315,cammic,Just another disaster movie....but this one is a disaster,2,5 June 2015,"I was not expecting this movie to be as bad as it was, but it was bad. It follows, what seems to be Hollywoods out-of-the-box storyline; husband hero who is divorced from wife, become hero to his daughter and ex-wife and they all live happily ever after. It is basically the same story and script from ""2010"", but I was not sure if this was a comedy or not. For eagle eye Australian viewers, you will find lots of goofs when the backdrop is supposed to be San Fransisco; the funniest is seeing a Band of Bendigo sign.... The special effects are so over done and over the top, that you just find it all a bit farcical. For example, post tsunami, he manages to drive a speed boat at full throttle without damaging the boat or tangling the engine!!! A cameo by Kylie Minoque is so out place....and it does not make any sense. Basically, I had a free ticket to this movie and it I had paid....I would be asking for my money back!",San Andreas

I thought this judging by the movies he has directed in the past such as ""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island"" and ""Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore."" But boy was I wrong!!! This movie was action packed. With a lot of destruction, violence, and disturbing scenes that made the movie more intense. The CGI was absolutely incredible. The acting was also surprisingly good. The Rock was better than ever and Carla Gugino and Alexandra Daddario did great. Hugo Johnstone-Burt and Art Parkinson did an awesome job. I am not even the biggest fan of Paul Giamatti but I loved him in this film. The only reason I'm giving this movie an 8/10 is because of the unnecessary romance. There was really no reason to throw that in the film because all it did was make the scenes more cheesy and eye rolling. If you love disaster films you will love this because it is visually stunning with top of the line stunts and CGI that made this movie one of a kind.",San Andreas
317,santiagonunez16,"It's a Dwayne Johnson movie, what else would you expect??!!",8,29 May 2015,"A movie with CGI and The Rock disguised as a disaster movie was actually a lot of fun. While it won't win any Oscars, it doesn't mean it's a bad film. Dwayne Johnson owns the movie right from the opening scene where we expect him to take charge of daring rescue after a motorist has steered off the road and is hanging on a cliff. Then there is the constant flexing of his huge biceps as he vogues for every scene from helicopter rescues to steering boats and planes. Still, this is the big budget, special effects movie Hollywood puts out every summer and the thrills are as huge as the big guy himself. The story is simple, sure we've seen it done before: divorcing dad from estranged soon to be ex-wife, in this case she's moved on to a richer boyfriend, and the daughter caught in between all of this will set off the story in motion. The most underrated actor in the world, Paul Giamatti, is brilliant as the scientist who figures out the catastrophic events that will soon unfold. The story would have been just as good with him in the lead and focusing on his character instead, but let's face it, he isn't the type of box office draw as The Rock. Still, I found his character underused a lot in this movie. San Francisco begins to crumble, along with various parts of California when the San Andreas fault lines give in. Now it's up to emergency rescue helicopter pilot to step up his game and do what he can to save his estranged wife and daughter. Think Die Hard of disaster movies. While the movie is predictable, loud, full of some decent CGI effects, it's still a pretty good night at the movies. Anyone who walks into a Dwayne Johnson movie expecting Citizen Kane here will be disappointed. This is a summer popcorn movie that does what it's supposed to and entertain you for 2hrs.",San Andreas

Here is the movie in a nutshell, which also tells you everything wrong with it:LAFD rescue expert Ray (The Rock - note that he and all his rescue team are retired, seasoned, special military rescue squad, whose last tour was in Afghanistan), abandons his rescue assignment after a huge earthquake in neighboring Nevada to go rescue 1) his almost ex-wife, then 2) his daughter, when other quakes hit in CA in succession. All of which was predicted by Paul Giamatti, super hero, best in class, geo-seismologist scientific dude from Cal Tech. Paul is reluctant to believe the warning system he created, and keeps praying instead. Prays at his computer, prays under the table, prays on national TV. Paul, you're supposed to be a world class scientist -- STOP PRAYING and get to the data points already!!So, no one even calls The Rock to see where he's gotten off to. He absconds with billions of dollars of taxpayer paid and some privately paid high tech helicopters, equipment, planes, boats and automobiles, abandons his ""post"", all for personal use in rescuing his ex-wife and daughter. Ioan Gruffudd has a small, inane, and totally unnecessary part in this film in which he is a total whiny *wat. Dwayne's daughter's part in the movie is written semi-smartly, but with lots of cleavage. The abrupt end to that semi-smart piece of writing comes when she takes a time-out to make out a little with the sub-hero while a pick-a-catastrophe Armageddon is happening around them in every direction.Meanwhile, The Rock and his imminent ex are running about willy-nilly in planes, boats and automobiles in a very stupid and unfunny manner trying to get to the daughter. Never once taking with him -- out of all of this stolen rescue equipment and whatnot -- any first aid kit, defibrillator, rescue gear.....not even a bandaid. Turns out, he doesn't need them. It doesn't just ride the line of miracles and (cine)magic, it erases them as it burns across those lines like a boss. It's like it was scripted or something. So, all's well that ends well. After a dozen or so of the most massive earthquakes in recorded history running up and down the San Andreas fault, gas line ruptures, water line ruptures, communications losses, aftershocks, random fires and a tsunami the size of which would have flooded to freaking Vegas; Marin County, just across the narrow channel separating the SF Bay from the Pacific -- and the SF Penninsula from the mainland north of the Golden Gate Bridge -- was absolutely untouched, and all the survivors were gathered there, on that first lovely hilltop, surveying the devastation. Magic is great, isn't it?? I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough for this movie. I will also avoid Carlton Cuse projects for the remainder of my natural life.",San Andreas
319,edwardscissorhands12-874-850830,San Andreas aka 2012 aka Day After Tomorrow,4,28 May 2015,"****I will indicate when I will begin spoiler talk so you can get my general feelings on the movie if you do not want critical plot points spoiled for you**** Have you seen the movies 2012, The Day after Tomorrow, Independence Day, Into the Storm, or any other disaster film? Well, if you have, you have also seen San Andreas, one of the most clichéd movies I have ever seen in my entire life. You already know how this entire movie is going to play out. It will start with some minor destruction, continue into a lecture being given by a teacher so that the writers do not have to think of creative ways to tell us information and instead spoon feed us vital background, the main character will be conveniently located at the center of the action, and then for the last act just reference any action movie ever made to see how the climax and falling action takes place. While everything is extremely predictable, I must admit that in terms of this movie just being a fun visual feast (although that is not at all what the tone conveys), I can say that most of the action and destruction scenes were pretty well done and actually extremely intense at some parts. However, when these scenes are not taking place, cue the useless, generic, predictable character development delivered by actors who are mainly there just for the pay check. Something else to mention is how incredibly stupid the characters are. A character was driving down a straight stretch of road for about a mile with a couple of miles of visibility, then all of a sudden they are shocked to see a massive (I'm talking the size of a foot ball field) crack going through the road stretching for miles. UHM, hello?!?! Don't you think he probably would have seen that, idk like a mile back?! It is stupid decisions such as these that really make me mad at the characters and do not make me feel bad when they face peril. I am talking about a lot of negative aspects of the movie, but I did have a decent time with it and I did actually get pretty frightened in some of the action scenes. But this does not make up for the overwhelming negative aspects also including way too many conveniences happening for the main characters that have to happen or else they would die and we would not have a movie. Overall, I would say you should check this movie out in theaters, but as long as you know not to expect too much, and as long as you do not have anything else better to do. And i mean that, NOTHING else better to do! Grade: 74/C.*********OKAY! Spoiler talk begins here!!!!!!***** For my spoiler talk for this movie, I figured that I would share with you a drinking game that I created in my head while watching this movie. The way you play is take a shot anytime you correctly guess the outcome of a plot point in the movie, or correctly identify something that is blatantly suggested to be a future reincorporation. I guess this isn't really spoiler talk because if you have seen any disaster/action movie ever you will be able to stay ten steps ahead of this movie at all times, never actually being surprised by ""twists"") I will share with you when (if I was playing) I had to take a shot: 1. Girl's mom's boyfriend emphasizes the strength of the building he is building; she later goes to try to survive the tsunami, shocker. 2. Ray discusses how one of his daughters died by drowning; what a surprise his second daughter had to be saved from drowning. 3. Ray saves his daughter and is giving her CPR; cue the cliché moment of silence then water flows out of her mouth JUST when we were scared and thought that she was actually going to die! 4. As***le boyfriend ditches main character's daughter (and serves as the rich, selfish d!ck also seen in 2012), and what a surprise he gets a comical death later on in the movie. 5. Car is trying to escape the collapsing parking garage, girl gets trapped, and what do you know the person to save her is the sweet guy she just met and shared very quirky dialog with. 6. Sweet guy saves girl by lifting cement block with a tire lift, who saw that coming! 7. Two main characters getting a divorce, but what a surprise they decide to stay together in the end. 8. In the end, characters hug and cry in happiness that they are safe and reunited, then the camera panned out to show the destruction one more time. What an original ending, am I right!! (I hope people are able to understand my sarcasm and not actually take this last part seriously, If you thought I was serious, you are the type of person who might actually like this movie.)",San Andreas
320,stepstosand,Earthquake disaster,2,19 January 2020,"Big earthquake film. Somewhat exciting at times, But would have been better if the lead actors would have driven of the edge of the San Andreas Fault and killed.",San Andreas
321,stepstosand,Kaboom,2,19 January 2020,"Acting 1-A lots of squinting and grunting between disaster after disaster. You don't really believe anyone. So you don't really care if they die or not. Some good special effects. Lots of people die.

322,storm_mica,"This is a comedy, right?",5,6 October 2015,"My partner and I watched this cold sober and found it hilarious; in fact I'm sure the neighbours must have thought we were on drugs... Just like the ""Airport"" movies of the 70's, it was so clichéd and cheesy it was funny.The plot was, of course, complete garbage. The Fire service let their pilots take the company chopper for a spin whenever a natural disaster strikes, right? And the hero can find his daughter in the middle of an earthquake AND tsunami ravaged city? And zodiacs capable of climbing up a tsunami wave (that was heading in the wrong direction BTW..) are lying around, fully fuelled and ready to be stolen... Maybe not as funny as the pilot firing a flare out the cockpit window of the concord to divert a heat-seeking missile from destroying the plane while in the middle of a ""loop the loop"" maneuver... but this one was up there so to speak...Its funny the number for people who have reviewed this as a serious movie; in fact it would be even funnier with ""funniest home videos"" sound effects overdubbed over the soundtrack.. but I diverge...The actors all did well to play it straight and not crack up laughing at the lame and stupid script they had to act. The Rock (and his biceps, triceps, etc) was a good choice in the lead. Good to see the cameo from Kylie (she kept that very quiet..) and also great to see local favourite Hugo Johnstone-Burt (Ben)(who is normally the policeman on Mrs Fishers Murder Mysteries) mixing it with the big boys and girls.This movie was filmed in my home town and on the Gold Coast (down the highway) and it was fun place and face - spotting. Good comedic value this one... stop thinking about it so seriously!!",San Andreas
323,sgholbrook,"You get what you are previewed...... ""A Disaster Movie""",7,2 June 2015,"A disaster Movie, that's about the only way to describe it. I think it would benefit from having a 20 minute build up to one or two big events or something, rather than one after another after another, of slightly increasing impact which is a rare thing to be saying and at points the script can seem very cheesy and unnecessary which in turn ruined the atmosphere a little.. But otherwise was worth the watch. Highly recommend NOT watching trailers for this film ! Only left 1 big thing left to shock me, BLOODY TRAILERS ! Otherwise, go enjoy yourself with this action packed film ! Also, it's probably worth a note that this film sounded awesome at a high volume ! It Needed it ! Didn't see it in 3D, but can't imagine it would offer that much more, it isn't needed to make this film what it is !",San Andreas
324,okg-11122,Not as bad as I thought it would be,8,10 July 2015,"Of course Dwayne Johnson was in this movie because when ever thing blow up he's there. This movie is based on something that could happen in the future or tomorrow. A okay action packed movies with lots of explosions, building falling down and lots of water. After I watched this in movie theaters I wish that I had watched it in 3d because the effects where awesome. Anyone who got to see it in 3d was pretty lucky. A gun movie if you are in the mood t see stuff fall and blow up. The reason why I don't give this a 10/10 is that some scenes are to fake to be real, even though the threat is a real thing. But it's a Good movie to watch with some friends and a bucket of popcorn.",San Andreas
325,mrloughrie,Very bad.,1,4 December 2015,"This is one of the worst movies of 2015. It's a dumb disaster movie. If you are in for a movie that depends only on special effects, it's this one.One of Alfred Hitchcocks sayings, ""If the sound cuts out while people are watching a movie, they should still have a perfect idea of what is going on."" This movie broke that rule.If this movie had bad effects, it would look terrible. It's the effects that made some people give it a positive review. It's a bad movie, lets all be honest. It's effects are the only reason it has 6.2/10.Other movies like Transformers: Dark Of The Moon (2011) are better because they have better plots. This is just garbage.Now you see the real reason I don't like this movie is because it depended too much on special effects.",San Andreas
326,fullbug,What's With All The Bad Reviews??,8,3 December 2016,"First off, I'm old school ultra conservative, so most movies of the last few decades and their reversal of roles (fem agenda) annoy the heck out of me. Not only is there mega cleavage flaunted in every other camera shot, but the women in most of these movies make Rambo look like a sissy. In other words...what a load of crap!Aside from that (however) this was a very well done disaster movie, with the usual personal side stories and some awesome special effects. And we're not talking a few crumpled buildings...the entire city of San Francisco is completely obliterated. Also plenty of action sequences from the air, ground, and sea.8/10 stars seems quite generous for someone like me that is politically butt hurt (Lol), but for those giving it 4 stars or less...there is something terribly wrong with you.",San Andreas
327,macadam122,Fun filled mayhem.,8,31 May 2015,"The summer disaster movie is a tried and tested formula of one third story and two thirds humungous special effects. San Andreas is no exception. No one goes to a disaster movie looking for Shakespeare and its obvious that most of the quite big names in this have been looking for a film they can do that doesn't call for angsty hand-wringing. It's big, it's bold and it's predictable fun. It's undoubtedly Dwayne Johnson's film and he plays the character he's good at, a tough but tender heroic type with the gutsiest moves and the scariest stunts. The stunts are great and kudos to the stuntpeople who can never get the praise they deserve. Don't go looking for highbrow entertainment. Take a big bag of popcorn and hang your scepticism up at the door. It's a great ride.",San Andreas
328,reyalvarez,A Boring Mediocrity,4,25 November 2015,"The movie ""San Andreas,"" starring Dwayne ""Rock"" Johnson, is the worst kind of movie. Just mediocre and nothing unique or new. As we all know, when a movie is spectacularly good, it is a masterpiece. When a movie is spectacularly bad, it can become a juicy, fascinating masterpiece like some of legendary director Ed Wood's movies like ""Force Nine from Outer Space."" ""San Andreas"" is neither of them. It is just a boring mediocrity just like thousands and thousands of boring movies which are released every year. There is nothing unique about it. Since the days of ""Towering Inferno"" and first ""Poseidon Adventure,"" countless disaster movies, including the present movie, have been released. Out of all these disaster movies, is there anything unique about ""San Andreas?"" Absolutely nothing. First, although the computer-generated graphics were well done, there is nothing eye-catching or new about it. We have seen many, many movies with this level of computer graphics. Also, the images in this movie are simply computer-generated, souped up versions of what we saw during the recent tsunami disasters in Fukushima, Japan and Aceh, Indonesia. Second, there nothing unique about this simplistic, comic book like plot. A hero, who has a problem from the past, tries his best to save his daughter from a disaster and a genius scientist, played by Paul Giamatti, makes a spectacular prediction and saves countless lives. Didn't we see this kind of plot countless times? In conclusion, this movie is just a bore with a hackneyed, cliché plot with average computer graphics. I am disappointed to say this because I like Rock Johnson, (I find him to be a fun guy.) but this movie is, on a scale of 1 to 10, just 4.",San Andreas
329,just_for_movies,Very generic but still a blast,7,30 May 2015,"San Andreas is the newest disaster movies and it's essentially like every other disaster movie. Even so, this movie was exceedingly entertaining with it's visual effects and impressive sound design. I wasn't expecting much when going into this movie but it definitely exceeded my few expectations.When going into this movie, one isn't going into it expecting an inventive story and lots of talking. One is instead expecting insane amounts of destruction and a visual spectacle. That's exactly what one will get when watching this movie. The visual effects are insane in this movie and just a blast to behold in 3D. The amount of detail to every CGI shot was impeccable. That being said, there were a few shots that were very obvious that it was CGI being used there. But those shots were few and far between and it didn't ruin the movie at all. I have to give light to the sound design as well because it was amazing. The sound department deserves an Oscar for their incredible work on this film. The story/plot is where this movie is weakest. This movie is basically as generic as a movie can get. Then again, this movie is considered to be an entirely original movie because it's not based off of previously created material. The actual story/plot is solid enough but still a little messy. Character development was generally pretty good but it could have been better. I suppose the worst part about this category is the pacing. The pacing is very messy and it jumps around a lot. The ending is quite abrupt as well I might add. Finally, all the actors did a fine job doing their thing and Brad Peyton delivered the goods with his directing skills.In the end, San Andreas is a movie boasting insane visuals, and a great sound design. It is generic and the pacing is off but at the end of the day, this movie is all about the visual effects and destruction. And it delivers just that. This movie is definitely worth seeing on the big screen and preferably in 3D.",San Andreas
330,Muhammad_Nd,A Good Hollywood Disaster,10,14 July 2016,"Here comes the ""Rock"" avoiding all types of obstacles and dangers. Before this film is over, he has confronted every possible element on Earth, and somehow, there's hardly a scratch on him or any of his relatives. This is quite remarkable when you recall that he has flown through fire, falling debris, somehow managed to avoid being crushed by one titanic tsunami, and that doesn't include the final part of the film when he's trapped underwater. If anyone's the star of ""San Andreas"", it's not the spectacular special effects, but the endurance of this human being who will go through anything to save his relatives.Of course, his is not the typical family. He has previous trauma and tragedies of his own, before the big ""ones"" hit. Because of some personal loss and lack of communication, he is faced with divorce, but his his ties are still strong, and there's somehow room for hope in the middle of all these disasters.To start, we meet a couple of Cal Tech Scientists, who have finally figured out a way to predict the arrival of a big earthquake. They test this device near Las Vegas, only to find out the device works, very well, as the first monster earthquake strikes Hoover Dam, giving us a preview of what a multi-million dollar production can give you when armed with the latest CGI technology and some terrific sound effects. Not having enough time to catch out breath, and we have already lost a human life and some impressive modern engineering landmarks.Soon, the remaining scientist realizes that the tremor in Nevada is just a precursor of what could be one of the worst earthquakes in history.If his calculations are correct, a huge portion of California will go through drastic changes.Once the big one hits, we see entire sections of Los Angeles crumbling, disintegrating, exploding, being enveloped by fire, etc., etc. This is all backdrop for the personal drama the ""Rock"" and his family are going through. His wife is trapped in a fancy restaurant at the top of a Los Angeles building. His daughter has gone through San Francisco and will soon face some spectacular problems herself, as this other metropolis will, if it's possible endure an even worse series of catastrophes than Los Angeles, including one monster tsunami and quakes that will probably be felt in the Eastern seaboard.The audience will witness falling glass, young stars being threatened by concrete blocks, electric cables, gaping holes, and every imaginable deadly possibility our screenwriters can come up with. It gets to the point when it just becomes a little too unbelievable. It's always fun to watch some creative special effects, but we need time to recover in between showcases, and ""San Andreas"" gives you very little time to breathe. Unlike the recent ""Mad Max"" entry, this one is a bit thin and scattered all over the place. It feels like the director is not really in control of his technology and his toys. Ridley Scott and George Miller seem to be handle both technology and drama together and separately. Here we might as well be watching a kid, as he records, the disaster, and it keeps being interrupted by the obligatory and obtrusive acting interludes.One is bound to have a good time if one is willing to believe the rather impossible situations on the screen. Oh yes, we can see the impact and tragedies which occur during and after the disaster, but we also know that it couldn't all happen at the same time.",San Andreas
331,jim_flowers,Irwin Allen where are you?,1,17 June 2015,"The B movie schlock that Hollywood used top turn out as horror movies. High dollar CGI, low budget story! I'm a movie aholic and see one practically every week. I rarely REALLY regret my choice, this was the exception. I is sssssoooo bad it is rather comical.Suspension of Disbelief is NOT ENOUGH to ""explain"" MAY parts of this movie. From the opening scene rescue where the helicopter hovers ever so delicately between the trench wall, even when a 4,000# car falls into the abyss whilst attached to a cable on the copter's winch to the GAWD AWFUL scenes where they are in a RID boat tooling through the streets of a VERY DESTROYED San Fran with TONS of debris floating in the water and yet, the outboard prop remains in tact, to the BREATHTAKINGLY HORRIBLE submerged scenes in the same TOTALLY DESTROYED San Fran with CRYSTAL CLEAR water!

Great acting and suspense and special effects, even though it's over 40 years old. ""San Andreas"" pales in comparison. The acting is mostly terrible, a cheap TV quality, with the one strong exception of Paul Giamatti and Archie Panjabi. The science and geology were interesting, would have been nice to see more of that (and Giamatti) and less of the incredibly unrealistic collapse of San Francisco and rescue. Then there were the hinted at effects of the quake on the rest of the world, but nothing more was shown. And what exactly happened in LA? The only story here was that of one family, and it was so uninteresting and too simply explained and solved. What a waste of effort!",San Andreas

While they don't disappoint, there were a few moments where they could have been better, in particular the opening scene, which was really bad in my opinion. Apart from that, this is a typical disaster movie, and as such it suffers from all the usual pitfalls of that genre : stereotypical characters (you've got the scientist, the hero who tries to reunite his family, the selfish a**hole, etc), predictable storyline and of course the infamous shot of a giant wave chasing the hero, or the earth shattering 2 feet behind him. At least they avoided the annoying/helpless teenager cliché ! All in all, nothing new to see here. Not bad, but not great either : 6/10.",San Andreas
334,tochukwu-83206,Destructive Summer Fare,6,19 February 2016,"For a while, I thought I was seeing a Roland Emmerich film. In fact, I could have sworn it was a Roland Emmerich film due to all that cataclysmic-disaster and wanton destruction featured in the film. For those of you who don't Roland Emmerich-he is that director who helmed commonplace summer natural catastrophic films like (Independence Day) and (The Day after Tomorrow)-sacrificing story and plot for sheer entertainment. However, San Andreas is directed by Brad Peyton and his utilization of sequences suggests that he is either trying to mimic Roland Emmerich or trying to outdo him.I couldn't agree more when a film writer from screenrant.com said-in his/her own words: ""Hollywood has been kind to Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. True! I couldn't agree more. He is one of the most successful wrestlers turn actor. He is that sure guy who you go to when you need a little bit of muscle and badass attitude in action figure. And as a result over half of his Filmography is in the action genre: (Fast and Furious Franchise), (Hercules) (Faster) etcetera. However, apart from the usual comfort-zone-acting, his character is laden by worry-with appropriate reason for that worry.Here he plays Raymond Gaines: a Los Angeles Fire Department Air rescue going through a divorce. Raymond divorce stems from the fact that he feels responsible for one of his daughter's death. After Blake (Raymond's surviving child) travels with Daniel: Emma's boyfriend (Raymond's wife) to San Francisco, an earthquake strikes obliterating the city. Raymond attempts to rescue Blake despite the continued destruction of the city-hoping that he doesn't lose another child.Despite the concerned nature of The Rock's character, there is little exposition for the character's mood. Dwayne Johnson though is able to pull off that season fire department rescuer with ease and seasoned experience. Here, he sort of lays back and allow the events of the film to take centre stage. Though there are still the usual displays of heroics here and there especially in that beginning scene, which looked like if the earthquake has started from there. But those courageous attitudes and behaviours are used to match the urgency of the situation rather than downright showing off of strength as we have come to see in some of his films (Looking at you Hercules). Don't get me wrong, The Rock is one of the stand- outs entertainers of our time: the type you will call a ""Movie Star"" and not a ""Movie Actor"". It has become a norm for most films to please its audience than educate on the revolving occurrences. San Andreas falls into that category. Scenes explaining what an earthquake is are usually done through fast-talking tectonic-plates seismic, blab-blab gibberish. I finished the film and yet am still not able to offer a simple definition of what an earthquake is. I should be able to do that considering that I've just finished seeing a film featuring falling skyscrapers and landscapes that seem to meander like a liquid flow. In the supporting characters, no one shines because expectedly women are still made to become the supportive figure (Carla Gugino's character). And the only female figure (Alexandra Daddario) that does something still looks as hot as ever after surviving earth- changing seismic events. And lest I forget, let me get this of my mind. Firstly, what's up with the similar make-up given to Carla Gugino and Alexandra: black hair/black hair, same shades of eye pencil in a too glaring attempt to make them look like mother/daughter? Secondly, what was the importance of Ioan Gruffuld role to the film? The film could have turned out well without his character, maybe save cost of production from the viewpoint of cast's wages. For Christ's sake, he was in the whole film without any importance to the plot screaming at each quake, surviving each with luck. And then when you think he might survive this ordeal, he is taken off the film in a much familiar death scene. That death scene is even more stupefied because of the helpless look on his face. It is not just an insult to the actor's talent but to the actor himself.Nevertheless, all praises to the film's special effects, catastrophe and on-screen San-Francisco's obliteration. Watching as the earthquake levels the whole city is entertaining and as such the audience feels less pity for the extras who scream around. Brad Peyton captures the wanton tragedy very well with believability from the quakes leveling down the skyscrapers down to the tsunami storm engulfing the city. There are several sequences which stood out. Particularly, I liked that scene where The Rock tries to beat a tsunami wave by speeding over it with a speed boat and when he seem successful a cargo ship follows with its containers spilling out- almost crushing the main characters. I also liked how the director scattered debris over the waters which had swallowed the city. And that sequence, that particular sequence where a cruise liner is washed on-land by the tsunami waves is commendable. The massive scale destruction makes for an interesting watch and the consequences of that are shown if only a little, especially that time where we see individuals stealing from an electronics store.Truth is that, San Andreas is the perfect blockbuster entertainment (destruction and all) that goes out of its way to please its audience so much that emphasis is removed from its casualties and placed on the survivors, but it could do away with certain elements and incorporate some-plot wise. Rating: 2 ½ stars out of 4.",San Andreas

And yes, every one is hilariously predictable.Yes, the hot girl is wet and her cleavage is showing for most of the movie.Yes, every shot is crammed with mind-numbing amounts of CGI. Normally that bothers me, in this movie it just works. If you see it in 3D you will be drooling.Go see it right now, seeing this in theaters is the absolute best waste of 2 hours you will spend all year, and I am extremely confident that you will have fun.Remember that moment in Independence Day when the aliens blew up the white house? or in the Dark Knight when batman flips the whole 18 wheeler front-ways with his motorcycle? or how about when the entire city of London was demolished in GI Joe Retaliation? the handful of cool scenes in that weird Godzilla reboot?San Andreas is basically 2 hours of jaw-dropping destruction, epic sequences, death scenes, and interspersed one-liners.

Why they showed lots of muscle I don't know for the rock. I could only see him using his arms to lift a woman. Plane and choppers crashing and lead actors not even getting scratched.From the last position in a boat where several other power boats are miles ahead, all suddenly disappear as rock surpasses them all in his small boat and survives.All in all just I would call this a movie for children to enjoy.

338,johnnmilw,So sappy and pretentious,2,27 August 2015,"In the spirit of early sappy disaster flicks like 'Earthquake'('74), 'Towering Inferno' ('74), combined with the shallow and horribly nagging morality stingers used in 50's sci-fi movies, 'Invasion of the Body Snatchers ('56)' and 'Tarantula' ('55), this movie is among the newer breed of disaster flick that exposes what Hollywood is as an institution. To begin, 'what if' scenarios like this are fun because we get to see exceptional movie-making and special effects. Tragically, the drawback is that good actors have lousy script material because all the resources are spent on CGI effects. The scripting was lousy, as every few moments we shift from life-threatening circumstance to heart-warming exposition of a characters morality then back again to disaster. By the end of the movie, all the characters who are of noble character are rewarded with both our awareness of how exceptional they are and they survive. The movies style is done in the same format as a movie like '2012' or 'Day after Tomorrow'. Very heavy on a disaster that in reality, would finish off most of the people, including the heroes, but the heroes escape death by mere centimeters or milliseconds. Sometimes, it's believable when 'the average in-shape person' is able to withstand hours of exhausting survival situations. Sometimes it is. The way Hollywood portrays how the 'average' emerges as an 'exceptional' in responding to crisis doesn't have to be so pretentious. I don't think we as movie-goers require that much.",San Andreas
339,Blazs91,'Los Angeles has fallen',7,14 February 2016,"Frankly saying, I was fairly anticipating this movie to be a new big blockbuster of Hollywood. According to the trailer, I was expecting something close to the mixture of 'The day after tomorrow' and '2012': a movie, which is about stunning visuals with a subtle plot of family issues and mediocre storyline. And my assumptions were right!The movie tells us an extraordinary story of an ordinary man, played by The Rock. He's everyday job is rescue people got jammed by unfortunate accidents. However, after a series of massive earthquakes in California, his primary responsibility turns out to be save his own family.If you saw the trailer, you might guess what this movie will provide you: a fair amount of action and destruction. There are not some characters in the movie. The main plot is twined around the scientist, whose mission is to figure out everything about the source of the disaster, and Dwayne Johnson, who is not really desperately aspires to save his family. You might see some character development during this movie, but nothing like what have not seen before. The Rock's performance was actually really good! The only problem was that even though he had some moments of true acting, he did not have too many well-written lines, and therefore, he did not have enough chance to show more of his emotions than his physique. His wife is also a great actress, and the chemistry between these two characters is very satisfying. However, I did not really liked the performance of their daughter, but the scientist, played by Billy Chrystal, was phenomenal! This person was the one, who actually made me scared about the upcoming disaster and feel worrisome about the happenings. I am not saying, at all, that the movie is bad, because of the weak plot. Actually, I fairly enjoyed it! We can receive some plot complementing the action sequences, which were the main strength of the film. The visuals are really stunning, and we could get a really fair amount of it. However, some scenes are quite near to the impossible, if you accept the fact, that you're watching a disaster movie, it won't decrease the experience, indeed! The movie has some really jaw- dropping moments, and all the visuals are clear, smooth and pure.If you liked nicely done effects of spectacularly collapsing huge buildings and prepared for a little tension of how an ordinary man tries to save his family, then this movie is for you! This film mainly focused on entertainment and not on storytelling. However, this attribute makes the movie's advantage, which is quite enough to make it enjoyable.My final ranking is 7/10.Thanks for reading!",San Andreas

Lets review all three of them: In the aftermath of some catastrophic event, the heroes (all divorced), save the day and guess what? They happily take back the old hags that dumped them for other men.Really? Are all the Hollywood writers out of ideas? Or there is only one guy that keeps the story and creates a different cataclysm? Personally, I'd rather be eaten by alien invaders, drown or be dead in an earthquake than returning to the x-wife.As the CGI goes, of course, top notch. Acting is overdone, and the Oscar goes to Paul Giamatti. Dwayne should stick to comedies. Carla Gugino should be on the cover of Playboy. Wait! Playboy doesn't do nudes anymore ...",San Andreas
341,tonyjcole94,Tremendous Graphics. Terrible Acting. Unrealistic.,4,3 June 2015,"After seeing 2012 I didn't think natural disaster films could get any worse. I was wrong. Let me give each component of the film a raw score out of 10 to break it down for you. We'll start with the good stuff.Graphics 9/10 Probably the best thing about this film. Everything looked so real. from the Hoover Dam being destroyed, to the Golden Gate Bridge being split in half. No signs what so ever of cheap CGI. i wish the motion designers of this film would have worked on some of the greater disaster films.Accuracy 4/10 Aside from the information given throughout the film given by Dr Lawrence Hayes, the accuracy was pure s**t. - for one a 7.1 earthquake wouldn't pulverize the hoover dam. - there would not be a tsunami in san francisco if the earthquake generated from the san andreas fault. - Faults do not split apart during earthquakes as shown in the movie. The ground on the two sides of the fault slide past each other; they do not pull apart. Narrow crevices may form due to bends in the fault or in regions with very strong shaking. - The San Andreas Fault is not long and deep enough to have a magnitude 9 or larger quake as depicted in the movie. The largest historical earthquake on the San Andreas was the 1906 magnitude 7.9 earthquake. It is plausible that a 8.3 quake could hit the San Andreas, but even that would not be ""felt on the East Coast"" as Paul Giamatti's character claims in the film.Plot 3/10i have to pick at this first because it really bothered me during the film. Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't The Rock Black/Samoan ? how in the hell does he have a fully Caucasian daughter? That really took away from the film being at the least bit somewhat realistic. Anyway, if you haven't noticed , this film nearly the same identical plot as 2012. Main character is some big time money maker who's marriage has went through the dump, throw in a buncha last minute saves from the ground collapsing, a girl being saved milli-seconds before a car falls etc. and at the end after he saves the world and hes back with his wife. blah blah blah. been there done that , NEXT!overall give the film a 4. it is for entertaining purposes and thats it. don't go see this for a great futuristic natural disaster that could happen in real life.",San Andreas
342,xatian11968,Ignore the naysayers and definitely go and see San Andreas!,10,2 June 2015,"I usually read the bad reviews before seeing a movie, so definitely read them and then still go and see San Andreas. It is a viably entertaining series of events that leap from one catastrophe to the utter destruction of San Francisco. If you ever wanted to see the peninsula of San Francisco go up in smoke Sodom and Gomorrah Style?! Then this is the film to see it happen. I mean the gay old city of Saint Francis by the Sea, literally wiped clean with the help of the Pacific, or at least that's what the viewer might infer from some of the smaller lines of the people in the aftermath. And what about that Hugo Johnstone-Burt! Talk about a man in a baby blue button up shirt you want around when the California fault lines open up. The only disappointment was that Hugo didn't take his wet shirt off being the ever able British gentlemen caring for his young lad brother.The Rock, well what can you say? When you want a Rock to stand on, Dwayne Johnson is your man. Carla Gugino and Alexandra Daddario, the mother and daughter troupe – Bravo! The script wasn't much to work with, and the viewer may not have wanted to know either you before the first earthquake, but definitely, Ms. Gugino WAS Dwayne's wife. When all hell breaks loose, she sternly faces death valiantly as her white knight battles falling sky scrapers and dares gigantic waves to defeat them. And Miss Daddario, like mother like daughter. And finally, Paul Giamatti, ladies and gentlemen... Text book Scholar and Savior, using his staff and his university's resources in a tight spot to save the Bay and the Coast from what could very well be the re- alignment of Golden State.This is everything all the other movies of 2015 thus far have lacked, someone to root for amidst the ruin of the City named for Saint Francis in San Andreas.",San Andreas

If you're a bit of an action-junkie like myself, you'll probably like this one with its non-stop action right through the film. While some of it may seem a little over the top, it is what it is. A ""Rock"" action film. I also didn't mind the rest of the cast in their roles and everyone seemed to pull their weight.

Writers of the story should be drowned in oil, for insulting everyone who watches this movie. Special effects are really ""special"". This looks like it was made by a drunk monkey. Don't waste your time. If you have 120 minutes to spend rather go and watch cloud move. I am really disappointed in Dwayne Johnson and Carla Gugino.

The storyline is somehow repeated and there are some flaws in it. The script has nothing special except may be one quote ""If you couldn't save her, then nobody could have."" well, I liked it myself, what u think? acting from all characters is good but no way to even dream about an Oscar there is nothing special about any of them, the human side and survival instinct could have been better used, these are the main lines I need to talk about, but again a very good movie, and I enjoyed it and certainly recommend it",San Andreas

347,mg3331,Satisfactory Disaster Movie!,9,29 May 2015,I saw this just yesterday on it's opening day in the UK and I would say it's better then I expected. Realistic it certainly isn't (the closest you'll get to that as far as disaster movies go is The Impossible but I'm not here to review that one) but the earthquake quake scenes are the most impressive to date. Duane Johnson hardly qualifies as an actor but he does serve his purpose as rescue pilot Ray who must save his wife Emma and his daughter Blake who is abandoned by her no-good step father. Blake is joined by British (I think Australian) engineer Ben and his little bro Ollie who come to her rescue. I think that these two are clearly added to the movie simply to as a romantic interest and to make her plight less lonely. Of course you know that Ray will come through for all of them in the end and the principal characters will all survive impossible situations. If you want a movie with plenty of tension and spectacular effects but still a happy ever after ending then this is for you.,San Andreas

The rest of the characters felt like there was no character plot behind them before casting even. We need hot Boobies...Viola! Alexandra Daddario and mama sita Carla Gugino appears with not even a speck of dust and full makeup more than half way through the movie. Mind you, they were gritty and bloody in the initial quakes. And so was Rock...but heck...we don't care. Its a disaster movie where the family had problems which are solved by surviving...nothing at all like Twister or Independence Day or Titanic even. Erm, excuse the Titanic. But we still have the Rock amidst great CGI saving ONLY his ex wife and ONLY his daughter and her fellowship. In case of emergency, break the glass and call LA Fire Department. I did watch the whole movie and seeing it again on the small screen would advise not to watch on the small screen.

The special effects where incredible. It's the kind of film that will shock you, make you feel joyous, happy, sad and a whole range of other emotions, it is the ultimate survival story.I have seen many film's with a similar storyline but this film tops all of those just when you think the worst is over, something worse happens it just keeps giving, I was glued to my seat watching I didn't want to miss a second.

Recently divorced from his estranged wife Emma (Gugino), he calls his daughter Blake (Daddario) to talk about their upcoming trip to San Francisco. Meanwhile, Caltech seismologist Lawrence Hayes (Giamatti) and his colleague Dr. Kim Park (Will Yun Lee) are at the Hoover Dam when an unknown fault nearby ruptures, triggering a massive earthquake which collapses the dam, killing Park in the process. After Ray is called into work, Blake reluctantly decides to go with her mother Emma's new boyfriend Daniel Riddick (Gruffudd).Hayes discovers that the San Andreas Fault is starting to shift, causing a massive 9.1 earthquake that starts ripping apart major cities along the fault line. At the same time, Emma is having lunch with Daniel's sister Susan (Minogue) in a highrise restaurant when the quake hits Los Angeles, destroying much of the city with Susan among its heavy casualties. Ray is able to save Emma, and they barely escape the city on his helicopter. Much of California becomes affected by the quake. In San Francisco, Blake and Daniel are trapped in their car on the basement of the latter's office. Daniel leaves her to call for help, but he flees in terror, leaving her behind. Blake is saved by Ben (Johnstone-Burt) and Ollie (Parkinson), two brothers that Blake had met moments before the earthquake. After calling her parents, Ray and Emma quickly fly up north to save her.When enroute, the engine in Ray's helicopter fails, causing him and Emma to make an emergency landing in nearby Bakersfield. After obtaining a vehicle, they drive out until they reach the now opened-up San Andreas Fault. They find an old couple who happen to own an airplane, who end up giving Ray and Emma their plane in exchange for their vehicle. Meanwhile, Blake, Ben and Ollie tries to find a spot in the city where Ray and Emma can save them; seeing that their planned rendezvous point, Coit Tower, is already engulfed by flames. With help from news reporter Serena (Panjabi), Hayes is able to warn others of a much more bigger earthquake in San Francisco, just in time before it hits; becoming the largest earthquake ever in history, recorded as a 9.6.Ray and Emma eventually make it to San Francisco, just as the aftershocks continue to destroy the city. They commandeer a boat and notice that a tsunami is about to hit the city. Along with other evacuees with boats of their own, they are able to get over the incoming wave near the Golden Gate Bridge. Daniel, who is on the bridge, is killed when a cargo ship slices the bridge in half, crushing him. The tsunami floods the city, killing many more people and collapsing several buildings. Blake, Ben, and Ollie manage to run into Daniel's unfinished building moments before the water hits. They move up floors and manage to signal Ray and Emma, who are searching nearby for Blake. But before they can save them, the building starts sinking into the ground, causing the floor Blake, Ben, and Ollie are on to flood with water. Ben and Ollie are able to escape, but Blake apparently drowns even as Ray manages to get her out. Emma crashes the boat into the building and rescues everyone and they escape before the building completely collapses. Once in the clear, Ray is able to revive Blake through CPR. The five make it to a relief camp in Marin County. The now reconciled Ray and Emma, along with Blake, Ben, and Ollie, talk about their future as the sun slowly sets on what's left of the Bay Area.See This Excellent Movie For The Terrific Story And The Irresistible Women In It.",San Andreas

AS an actor he is very versatile and this movie is no exception. His performance is flawless. Paul Giamatti's performance, small as it is, as the Cal Tech Seismologist is spot on as well.There were the typical cheesy scenes you have in disaster films but not over the top where you roll your eyes and can't believe they made the actors say that. and the special effects were believable. The idiots who stand at the beach even though the tsunami warning is blaring, the old couple hugging in the impending doom. Cheesy yes, but if they were left out you would be asking 'where are all the cheesy lines it's a disaster movie after all"". The devastating destruction scenes were definitely believable. The film of course centers an a select group of people and how the disaster brings them together, I thought it was well put together.The movie starts right off with action, reminded of the opening scene in Cliffhanger.This disaster movie about a huge earthquake in California hits the major issues including a tsunami.The locations seem to be accurate IE Route 198 about 70 miles back. That is often were the flaws in these types of movies occur: names of routes, buildings, directions etc. I live in SoCal and the LA info appeared on track, I don't know San Fran at all so I would have to differ on that location.And thank goodness the jerk off gets his just rewards and the good guys are all OK, well except for poor Kim.Cute new Australian actor,Hugo Johnstone-Burt is perfect in his role and and you have to love his little brother Ollie (Art Parkinson).I repeat who wouldn't want The Rock to direct you to safety- 'just get up against something sturdy...triangle of life'",San Andreas

The plot runs on rails so even with some pretty good action and destruction the sheer inevitability is crushing. What is it with Americans? The ending (happy of course) includes: 1) a prayer meeting 2) the stars and stripes unfurling in slo mo. 3)A sunset The American family reunited and having a group hug. obviously the point of these epic disasters is to have loads of heartwarming family bonding and kids reconnecting etcHow come the rock can breathe underwater for 10 minutes?

The acting, what little there is, was not surprising giving the cast and subject matter. I make exception for Paul Giamatti. The majority of the credits for the film go to the special effects people, as unbelievable as they are. Two outstanding points in this film belong to Alexandra Daddario; and her eyes are not bad either. Hence my rating of 2 rather than 1.

Currently in cinemas, this movie is amazing in 3D.San Andreas is the story of Ray, a rescue-helicopter pilot. Following an earthquake in Nevada, which then travels to San Francisco, he must danger across the dangerous new territory to save his wife and daughter.The movie was truly amazing. I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie (I'm pretty sure I almost broke my Mother's hand clinging to it). The effects are brilliant, and it truly makes you feel like you're there in the streets of San Francisco, struggling through yourself. A heart-wrenching emotional journey that will leave you shaking with adrenaline long after.I highly recommend seeing this movie in cinemas, in 3D. The acting is spot on and the effects don't look fake. It's a set above the rest of most disaster movies; it's set a very high bar in the genre, leaving the only question: can something beat this movie?In my opinion, not until special effects get even better than they are today.10/10, if you're looking for the right movie on a date, or just a night out, go see San Andreas.",San Andreas
364,macdaddy3598,"The action is fun, but the story is awful",5,24 January 2021,"As a disaster movie it stands tall on bodycount by essentially wiping out all of California's coast. The spectacle along the way is a CGI cornucopia, but that's where the awe begins and ends.I love The Rock. Funny, strong and charismatic. He's the true action hero but this movie turns him into a transportation expert who mansplains his way through commitments of grand theft auto.As the destruction unfolds, and an earthquake scientist (a wasted opportunity of Paul Giamatti) holds a Q&A while government leaders are nowhere to be found, The Rock (Ray) takes his county issued Search and Rescue helicopter on a recon mission to save his freshly ex-wife. Take a minute to process the absurdity of this trained medic flying over millions of people dying in buildings and on the streets to save his ex without as much as wondering if, maybe, the search and rescue team could possibly use the chopper he's joyriding with.Of course the razor thin plot has their daughter in peril 380 miles away. She reports that mom's new boyfriend abandoned her when in fact only the audience knew that he walked off after being shellshocked while trying to get her help. Mom calls his cell (from the stolen chopper) and wishes death upon him. Little morbid when you realize the real story.So dad flys the helicopter toward San Francisco, but of course the rotor fails. Instead of setting it down in and unpopulated area - like I dunno, the ocean? - he crash lands into a crowded store increasing the bodycount via collateral damage. The looters don't seem to care there's a helicopter in middle of Walmart leaking fuel as the anti hero dad and mom steal a previously stolen truck. The lazy writing helps people beyond the ethics question because, it's fine, it was already stolen.Meanwhile the daughter and her newly minted boyfriend of 30 minutes are on a mission to high ground. She knows everything about first aid and fire truck equipment, ""my dad is with search and rescue"" she claims. Well she passes thousands of desperate people running in the streets waving their arms. Clearly her dad's selfishness was also inherited.The daughter (Alexander Daddario) spends the duration of the movie breathless. After the action begins she can't belt out a single mindless line without breathing heavy. This occurs even as she stands still to share her incredible knowledge of what to do in this emergency, to two people.Back to dad and mom, well, they they've just stolen a plane. For a trained medic watching the world literally burn 5000 feet below is fine as long as you go find your daughter in the chaos of millions dying. So, The Rock makes it to San Francisco and realizes he can't conveniently land a plane, so time to skydive! The plane goes on magic autopilot as the two leap from the side door with no concern of where the plane will crash and how many more people he will literally kill.The daughter and her soulmate of 1 hour find a tall building to escape the tsunami as dad steals a boat, passing thousands of dead floating bodies (not shown but would be true) to save the girl.Part fish, The Rock rescues her underwater and saves her and the love of her life, and his little brother.Now our heroes get to higher ground, where oddly, only about 100 survivors made it to, as he hugs his estranged wife and Mensa member daughter proclaiming they'll simply 'rebuild' as the entire 2000 mile coastline is annihilated.5 for the spectacular destruction

They were so over the top that destruction in your average Godzila movie looks like a boring home renovation video. If they cut some of the pointless scenes and shots (and this movie has plenty of those), they could have added a super volcano and an asteroid impact... utterly missed potential for even mode bombastic landscaping!Do you remember that Emerich's 2012 movie?

367,edharrison17,Good movie.......But!,7,31 May 2015,"As a fan of disaster type films, I was really looking forward to ""San Andreas"" and the magnitude of destruction L.A. and San Francisco would receive. A precursor event a the Hoover Dam, followed by a 9.1 in Los Angeles and a monster 9.6 in the City by the Bay!! As usual we have the human drama family issues as a secondary tale, which in comparison to other movies of the genre, it was rather tame and low key, as compared to say, ""Twister"", which was horribly annoying to watch. In ""Twister"" the human divorce drama was too much at times and totally pointless. In ""San Andreas"" it's just about right.As for the disaster sequences, I would have preferred more views from different parts of the city being destroyed, instead of just one general area where the family rescues were to take place. L.A. is a huge city and for the focus to remain just in one area is a shortcoming.The San Francisco portion was more widespread, mainly from the Golden Gate to downtown, but that's it.The CGI effects weren't much over the top and were the highlight in this film. You should not be disappointed at all.Recommend the slower, but very impressive, non CGI effects in the 1974 film ""Earthquake"" with Charleston Heston and Ava Gardner, if you want more of a city-wide view of L.A. being destroyed by a major quake.In the 1974 version, you have freeways bridges cracking, city blocks crumbling, LAX shaking, cows tumbling, cars getting crushed, elevators free falling, power line towers rocking, houses falling off stilts, mission bells shaking and the Capital Records building getting sheared.Overall, I give ""San Andreas"" a 7/10, impressive effects and a good human story.

We thought the whole idea was very cool and loved watching the movie and understanding more about real life natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis.",San Andreas

Seriously? This movie is absolutely horrendous, and extraordinarily predictable. The acting was bad, the effects were not amazing, the story was poorly executed, and there were several completely pointless subplots.I wish I hadn't watched this.",San Andreas
370,oakshield,Very low expectations and it's still garbage,3,13 January 2020,"Well, it's a disaster movie, what're you gonna expect? But this one takes all the bad tropes and cliches of disaster movies to the max. Every single character is a stereotype from start to finish, the dialogue is vomit inducing, the story is preposterous and the movie would be best served by having no dialogue at all.The visual effects are at about the same level of previous big budget disaster movies from many years ago. They're so-so, it just completely takes you out of the experience the fact you can spot the green screen plenty of times.Three stars - One for the Rock just playing himself as usual and one each for Alexandra Daddario's pair bouncing around whenever possible.Seriously people, this cost 110 millions dollars and there is better amateur content on youtube. I've no idea how it made close to half a billion. Guess ""family"" means gullible.",San Andreas
371,duncan-gordon11,"If you want a good movie, get a good director, screen play, cast, etc.",5,4 June 2015,"I stayed for the whole movie because I thought I recognized some of the cast beside Johnson. turns out, no. Someone will find Johnson's right type of movie. And maybe he'll choose better scripts or something, but this one is poor. This disaster movie could have been written by an avid first year high school student in his spare time at lunch. Most of the cast were OK acting wise. The direction of the movie showed no innovation, no uniqueness. If Johnson is going to continue with acting, he should not be lead in a movie. Or try something with a smaller budget that he has to be more versatile in. I wont be going to any more Dwayne Johnson movies anytime soon, although its not really his fault in this one.",San Andreas

In the first few minutes you see Hoover damn with water almost as high as the water could possibly become, maybe even higher. Besides Hoover damn, there is the ridiculousness of buildings falling and resting on each other, a ship moving out to sea but yet suddenly is going faster in to the bay than the tidal wave the ship is riding on.... Worst part was a giant gaping tear in the ground they called the San Andreas Fault, but the scene looked more like the flat Midwest than the actual San Andreas Fault.

374,paulquilichini,It falls on its own.,1,13 October 2015,"I can't fault the acting, since the rest of the movie was bad enough for me to not even notice.**SPOILER** The main group of characters should have died many times over- and I would have been kind of glad- because they made terrible survival choices throughout. I know, dramatic effect has to be achieved, but in this movie it was achieved at the expense of my empathy.I'll skip over how many laws of physics and math were broken, since that's a decomposing horse in Hollywood these days.The worst part? At the end, Dwayne's character stands across the bay surveying the destruction, while an American flag unfurls from the remains of the bridge. ""Now we rebuild"", he says, with his family in his arms. Yeah... he's SEARCH AND RESCUE! Why is he not thinking about now rescuing any of the thousands of trapped and injured people before more die, and especially before thinking about rebuilding?! What?! Now we rebuild? Aren't you skipping a step? One thing they left out: he didn't travel by train. We had plane, helicopter, boat, parachute, and truck. They missed train.

Granted Carla Gugino is one of if not the most sexy woman in the world so she is the sole reason i gave it 3 stars. As for Dwayne Johnson.... He failed, i usually love his movies but in this one nothing works. Its just a mess with poor writing and poor acting. The only good acting comes from Ioan Gruffudd who is hardly in the movie....

They created a somewhat believable post-apocalyptic environment, don't wanna know just how long the post-editing took them for this movie.All in all, just because of the special effects, I would consider this movie to be worth watching, despite it being the same old song and dance you have seen in theaters for the last 20 years. It merely looks beautiful because of some really talented effect-studio.The only thing that I really didn't think was necessary was the story of the geology-department that ran alongside of the main plot. It wasn't intertwined at any point, they both kept to be separate stories until the end. Kinda seemed superfluous to me, left the impression that they had to explain their movie cause everything wasn't clear as is.Other than that, solid 7/10 for this kind of movie.",San Andreas

378,Bravesfan82,Worse Than You Can Imagine,2,25 January 2016,"This is a shortened review. For my full length review, please visit: http://guywithamovieblog.blogspot.com/ I have a soft spot for disaster films. I'm not ashamed to admit it. They're generally a fun, energetic way to spend a couple hours while munching on popcorn or throwing back handfuls of Skittles. They're almost always better if you're able to disconnect your brain, sit back, and just enjoy the spectacle.The genre has a rich Hollywood background. It goes back fifty or sixty years, but hit a pinnacle of sorts in the 1970's with such excellent films as Airport, The Poseidon Adventure, The Towering Inferno, and Earthquake. The 1990's saw a revival of the genre when audiences were treated to the likes of Twister, Titanic, Armageddon, Independence Day, and Deep Impact. They weren't always good films (I'm looking at you, Volcano), but they were big (big casts, big special effects) and emotional and simply fun.Since the beginning of the 21st century, the disaster film genre has seen its share of hits and misses. The Perfect Storm, Contagion, The Impossible, War of the Worlds, and Gravity have all been very good or even great. They have carried on the tradition in a very noble way. San Andreas is one of the most recent additions to the genre, but it fails on almost every level.The plot is threadbare, but concerns one family dealing with the effects of gigantic earthquakes shaking and shattering the Earth along the titular fault line in Nevada and California. The father, Ray (played by the normally charismatic Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) is a former Army medic and current rescue chopper pilot and EMT. His soon-to-be ex-wife, Emma (Carla Gugino) is moving in with her new boyfriend who, of course, is a real jerk, but she doesn't know that yet. Rounding out the family is Blake (Alexandra Daddario), Ray and Emma's daughter who is setting off for college when the movie picks up.San Andreas, much like lesser disaster films such as The Day After Tomorrow and 2012, uses the ""fractured family overcomes enormous difficulties to rebuild their lives together"" motif as if Cruse simply pulled the formula out of a hat of clichés early in the writing process. I don't think I'm spoiling anything for anyone when I say there was never one moment during the entire 114 minute runtime where I thought they weren't going to end up together after the horrendous events they had to endure. Nothing like a national tragedy with millions of fatalities to bring a family closer together! One somewhat baffling aspect of the plot is there is scene after scene of Ray stealing different vehicles and piloting them towards San Francisco in an attempt to rescue his stranded daughter. He starts off in his helicopter and then steals a pickup truck, then a plane, then a boat. By this point, I was already laughing at the movie and I began to envision a series of events where Ray has to commandeer a railroad locomotive and, in the final harrowing moments, a vintage San Francisco cable car. Sadly, those wishes didn't come true. If they would have, the movie would have been slightly better.For a movie like this, the plot doesn't have to be revolutionary to make a great film, though. If the characters are relatable, engaging, and act in believably human ways, they can make up for something simple and ordinary. Unfortunately, these characters (and the others they meet along the way) are none of those things.As far as the cast goes, I thought it would be the film's saving grace – even if other areas fell flat. I almost always enjoy Johnson, even in lesser films. He's got charm and charisma to spare and has shown some decent acting chops (especially in the criminally overlooked Pain & Gain). Gugino and Daddario have been fine in the few films I've seen them in and, if nothing else, they're both attractive (especially Daddario!) and have screen presence. Unfortunately, just like most aspects of this film, the performances are average at best and laughably bad at worst.Paul Giamatti (playing a Cal-Tech scientist who figures out a way to predict the quakes) was who I was most looking forward to seeing, though. Giamatti might be the best actor of his generation and I have been enthralled by his various performances for nearly 20 years. San Andreas is one of those rare films where he would have been much better off just saying ""no"" when his agent approached him about taking the role. He's not given much to work with, no one in the film is, but he also seems to be phoning in the entire performance. I don't necessarily blame him – why exert too much energy when the project certainly doesn't deserve it? – but he could have been the one bright spot in an otherwise dismal film.Even the basic glue that normally holds these big spectacles together – the fancy computer effects – were seriously lacking. There's a moment at the beginning where a young woman is driving and goes off the road. Her car flips a comical amount of time before getting snagged on the side of a cliff. The entire scene, from the car to the surrounding area, is so poorly rendered that it looks like an Asylum production with a $1 million budget, not a major studio release. In fact, almost all of the scenes involving moving vehicles were obviously filmed with green screen backgrounds. This method is not new, of course, but on better films with better filmmakers, it is much less obvious and distracting. To be taken out of the film, practically at the start, was a serious blow.",San Andreas
379,louis-crabb,"Predictable, Terrible",3,31 May 2015,"This movie had almost the exact same story as the equally terrible 2012. Two people with a kid got divorced, ex-wife marries a douche, douche dies, divorcees get back together happy ending, 'Murica F*** yeah. I was sitting with my friend in the cinema and as the movie started I called the ending and guess what I was one hundred percent right. We turned it into a game to try and predict when the next disaster would strike and who would die and we never failed. There was never any peril even when one of the main characters supposedly died because we knew she would not. And the Rock or 'Ray' had superhuman abilities like ripping of car doors and 15 minutes of breath holding.DON'T SEE THIS MOVIE.",San Andreas
380,twogunrosie,Earth Shaking Thrills in 3D,9,9 June 2015,"If any part of this movies was implausible ... who cares!?!? It was one awesome thrill ride from beginning to end. This action movie was all about action. Of course that are some scenes where you might be tempted to roll your eyes knowing that there's now way it could happen like that, but if they made the movie true to real life rescues, it would be boring. This movie is everything but boring.Dwayne Johnson was at his best - again. He's cute, he's funny, and he's a great action movie star. The movie has lots of laughs to give you a release after each roller coaster ride it sends you on, a necessity for this kind of ""edge of your seat"" action.When we saw this movie, we misread the movie schedule and arrived too late to see the regular movie. Although the 3D version was more money, we don't go to the movies that often, so we thought ""what the heck"" and paid a little extra. We were glad we did. If you have the option to choose between regular and 3D - see it in 3D. You won't be disappointed!",San Andreas
381,hridhik,"Great popcorn flick,but a disastrous movie",5,27 September 2015,"I just watched San Andreas and I have to say that i was pretty disappointed. If you enjoy fast paced movies with CGI effects everywhere then this is your movie.The script is pretty weak and is the normal cliché storyline you would expect for a disaster movie. The CGI what i think is fantastic and was the only highlight of the movie. The destruction shown is pretty realistic and convincing. The acting is okay. Not good,not bad just okay. The characters are just blank. They don't have any chemistry whatsoever between them.There are like a hundred plot holes or ""sins"" for this movie.Let me mention some. So Rock's daughter Blake is at a skyscraper when she has a short conversation with a guy over there.And then he goes and the quake hits and later Blake gets trapped. Then this guy who should be running for his life from this hell risks his life and try to save this girl who he even barely knows. I just the hate the fact in the whole movie Rock just tries to save his own family! I mean dude works in the rescue department.The movie wants us to think that only that family is important and they barely show us the tragedy or the loss suffered by other people.You even rarely see people die. And this movie is very predictable.You would know what would happen in the second every time something bad happens. There are some cool action scenes (especially liked the tsunami one) so i wouldn't call this an entirely bad movie. Anyway, this my opinion.There are a lot of praising reviews out there and I will respect that.Watch this movie , and decide for yourself.",San Andreas
382,agsteribbe,Excellent old fashioned disaster movie,9,12 September 2015,"Finally a real old fashioned disaster movie, with most of the movie time being spend getting nearly killed. Of course the whole story is pretty thin and the situations are absurd to an agree that it is sometimes laughable but strangely enough it fits the movie.It is just a 2 hour long earthquake happening around you with brilliant visuals, fantastic sound effects and for a movie of this kind, quite reasonable acting too. The family take on the disaster movie works reasonably well, focusing on bringing mom pop and the kid together again through all the mayhem that's happening around them. As a European i have to say for my fellow viewers : There is the usual all American flag waving during the movie and a laughable slow motion shot of an enormous USA flag at the end of the movie. For the American readers : Don't see this as an insult, we just have a different look on nationalism in Europe. To sum it up you get falling buildings, tsunami's all kinds of mayhem and not to forget miss Daddario's bouncing cleavage to look at for 2 hours, what's not to like !",San Andreas
383,raz-boy,A disaster movie with the Rock,6,2 June 2015,"I had a really fun time with this movie. ""San Andreas"" seems like a typical disaster movie that we have already seen a hundred times before, however some noticeable elements of this film made it much more enjoyable than most of the other movies of the same genre that we get today.First of all the movie was very well paced. There were hardly any moments throughout the film that I would like the scene is getting dragged on or is too slow. ""San Andreas"" is almost constantly filled with action, which is what the audience wants from this type of movies. Another important thing is that this movie didn't take itself too seriously. It was supposed to be a popcorn flick, and it was. Most of the jokes were really funny and not forced. Sure there were a couple of scenes that I would go - ""Really?"", but most of the time it was fine.The visuals are spectacular! The insane special effects were definitely my favorite part of the whole movie. And finally. the Rock is just AWESOME. He is basically playing the same guy in every movie that he is in, but that is why we love him!",San Andreas
384,michelle139,Great Movie,10,30 May 2015,Went with high expectations just from seeing the trailer.And I can say I was not disappointed at all. The storyline was great the effects of the movie was AWESOME. I saw it in 3D and jumped a few times in the movie it kept me on the edge of my seat. I was extremely impressed in the acting and the sets of the movie. It doesn't matter if the science is shaky. We all go to the movie to enjoy them not to be picking it apart over science. I can see this actually happening sometime in the future. The only problem I had was with the tidal wave was that it would have crossed the ocean more than flood the city.Other then that it was a really good movie.,San Andreas
385,topeth,"Another ""Seperated husband saves the day"" cliché",6,3 October 2015,"By the moment the movie started and the rescue team were saving a girl who happened to got jammed between two mountains, I knew it will be just another ""fire/rescue guy saves the day"" Hollywood cliché.First of, I didn't watch it in theaters. Never wanted to anyway for the low ratings and getting a hint of the story. I'm glad I didn't. Except for the shiny visuals of earthquakes this movie doesn't have anything new to offer.Despite of having a monotonous story line the movie is so full of goofs. It doesn't matter how many spins a helicopter gets while crashing, how many twists a car does while spinning away between building blocks due to earthquake there seem to have not much damage done over victims, especially when they suppose to live till the end of the movie (e.g. The wife and daughter of the hero who's up there on the helicopter) I don't feel like writing any further. Just for the sake of formality I'd just rate this as follows: *Acting - Terrible terrible terrible except our beloved daddy.*Screenplay - Boring *Cinematography - Good if not great. I'll give a thumbs up to CGs. After all the movies are earning on it nowadays.My rating: 6 for the CGs of course, I'd have given it 5.If you don't have anything to do and just to kill your time by watching a pop corn flick, go for it.

388,BlackLemonTea,A Movie That Describes Today's Hollywood,4,12 October 2015,"San Andreas basically tells the story of the heroic rescue-chopper pilot Ray (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) who is about to divorce with his wife (and consequently be more distant to his loved daughter). Suddenly a massive earthquake appears in California and destroys everything. Ray sets his goal to rescue his family and other people while the whole city and its buildings fall apart.Let me start off with the plot. There is not much to say - and especially nothing good. The reason is easy to explain: The plot is very, very predictable. First we get introduced to the main character who is a real hero and whose job it is to save lives. Suddenly a big event occurs and forces the hero to save even more lives. Of course many obstacles appear and he needs to solve them no matter what it costs. The movie uses tons of clichés and is not original or creative in any way. The same happens over and over again: Buildings fall apart, lives get saved, people try to survive, more buildings are destroyed and lives get saved. Oh, and even more buildings suddenly crash. If you want to teach someone why using clichés make your movie or script worse, then simply show them this movie and if they have a brain they will understand.On top of that the characters are even more boring than the plot. Father who faces divorce papers but wants to stay near to his daughter that he loves so much? God, that's a great idea and I have never heard about that before. A city gets destroyed because of a huge event and the protagonist needs to solve the problems in a heroic manner? Great ideas, great writing *sarcasm off* I think I made my point clear. The characters are flat and do not give me much reason to care for them. Furthermore the acting is below average. I think ""The Rock"" is a very like-able personality off the camera, but as an actor he is disastrous. But I do not only blame him, the whole cast does not seem to be very convinced of what they are doing. The flat character design does not help either.I have more negative aspects to mention, but to cut it short I will just sum them up briefly. The dialogs were horrendous and uninteresting, the visual effects disappointed as well (considering the time we live in and comparatively to other movies like ""Jurassic World"" or ""The Avengers"") and the movie did not really have much suspense that could have made it at least a tiny bit exciting. The only positives I took from the film were some good long shots of some building that were beautiful to watch.Let me finish this review with a final rant. This movie sums up the current situation of Hollywood.I recently watched a discussion between a few screenwriters about how the industry works and evolved over the centuries. Everyone agreed that today's movie industry targets twelve-years-old children who beg their parents to let them watch the newest action flick with their favorite movie star. Of course this might be an exaggeration and generalizes the situation, but I partly agree with this statement. This is the reason why ""The Avengers"" or ""Jurassic World"" or even ""San Andreas"" have a better box office than movies that were supposed to be movies and not just mediums used to earn a lot of money. Hollywood is not a movie industry anymore, it is a money industry. Alright, to be fair, money has always been a huge part in Hollywood. But at least in the past there were actual filmmakers who cared for the content, the characters, the story and the FILM. All that is very rarely seen in today's Hollywood.To make it clear, naturally there have been trashy movies in the 80s or 70s and before as well, but today these movies unfortunately dominate the market, or at least it seems like that.Prominent names like Dwayne Johnson (who no doubt is a cool guy off- screen but a rather weak performer on screen), attractive faces like Alexandra Daddario and scripts that don't want the audience to think much and contain a lot of over-the-top-action and funny gags (and make you wonder why you aren't a successful writer) is what coins Hollywood currently. Why? Because that's the way you make money. I find that deeply sad and worrying. There are just a handful of movies I am looking forward to watch this year. To sum it up, San Andreas is a waste of time and money. If the filmmakers don't care, why should I do? Save your money for the movies coming out this winter (for example ""The Revenant"" or ""Macbeth"") instead of spending it on this one. 4/10",San Andreas

I usually like the Rock but this is probably his worst movie.,San Andreas
392,dreamtakers,Good Movie Paired with Jaw Dropping Visual Effects makes it Worth Watching,8,24 June 2015,"I got to admit that I have a soft spot for disaster movies. They are always a blast to watch and San Andreas is no exception. You can expect all the significant recipes for a perfect disaster movie blended into San Andreas. Cue: Ground cracking quakes, fast collapsing skyscrapers, dams bursting, bridges falling, heart-dropping 100 feet tsunamis, explosions blowing up in every corner and piles after piles of destructions and rubbles. To top it off like every other movies of similar genre, you can observe people on a mad dash for their lives and deaths littering as a result of tumbling structures or other unfortunate ways possible. The highlight of San Andreas is definitely the mind blowing visual effects. Technology has really come a long way. The CGI in San Andreas is undeniably stunning and a fabulous feast for the eyes. The effects are so surreal that you will feel as if you are experiencing the earthquake itself. A movie would not be complete without some much needed drama. Throw in a fearless hero (Ray), an estranged wife (Emma) with her new tycoon boyfriend (Daniel) and daughter (Blake) with brains, beauty and brawns. When all hell breaks loose and Daniel abandons Blake, Ray and Emma team up to search for their daughter in San Francisco amidst this wild apocalypse and face infinite obstacles in their quest. Melancholy is aplenty with inevitable deaths and tear-jerking near death scenarios. However, there are some light moments in the movie between the darkness and disarray. British charms, romances and funny dialogues are some of the elements that uplift the movie. The cast for San Andreas is superb. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson has once again proved his acting chops by portraying as bold helicopter rescue man Ray Gaines. Carla Gurgino is equally fantastic as wife Emma, and daughter Blake well played by talented Alexandra Daddario. Australian newcomer Hugo Johnstone-Burt also does a pretty decent job as romantic interest Ben. Paul Giamatti is a stand out and he is absolutely amazing as his role of a genius scientist Dr. Lawrence, who discovers a way to predict earthquakes and hurriedly warns citizens of the Bay Area about the impending disaster - the largest earthquake in history (9.6 on the Richter scale) that is about to strike SF. Then, there is Colton Haynes who makes a brief yet memorable appearance at the film's start as rescue worker Joby and cool cameo by superstar Kylie Minogue.San Andreas managed to achieve what it aims to achieve: Entertainment. The film takes movie goers on an incredible adventure and invokes whirlwind of emotions along the way: fear, fascination, sadness and happiness with insane disasters, ruination of famous landmarks, incredible visuals and eye candies at the side. Do not anticipate anything original from San Andreas; just sit back, relax, munch on some popcorn and escape yourself in this summer blockbuster.",San Andreas
393,eweerstra,Total crapfest,2,10 March 2019,"I would've given it a 3 until the cheesy kiss between the older English boy and the daughter. Or maybe if the 2 guys tag teamed her.

I want those 2 hours of my life back",San Andreas
394,marosbts,Mother of all Disasters,1,28 December 2016,"Amongst all disaster movies I have seen in the last 2 decades, this will get a prominent spot. But one which puts this movie really into the top position of the most dumb movies ever seen. Yes, this movie has managed to actually beat 2012. I even find The Core as a way better movie than this one, which is a complete waste of time.For one - the movie is absolutely unbelievable. Hell, even Sharknado seems like a scientifically researched movie against this. And while in every single disaster movie you know from the beginning, that a disaster will strike, you still can incorporate some twists, some unpredictable and entertaining storyline into the movie. Clearly, this was not the case in San Andreas - the disastrous disaster movie.But lets go step by step - opening scene - a girl drives in her car and does all the stupid things you should not do while driving. The only surprising thing is that her crash happens only on the 3rd time she does some stupidity. But from the first second you knew she will crash. Our hero - The Rock - immediately comes to the rescue while her heavy American built SUV is being held above an abyss by one tiny winy tree branch which would hardly hold an adult American person. But with some totally unbelievable airmanship, our hero positions his chopper in a way to rescue this poor girl in the last second. And then things go on like this - totally predictable - disaster strikes and in the last second our heroes manage to save themself or be saved by Dwayne. The amazing thing is that everybody else is totally dumb and despite super strong earthquake, the folks in San Francisco head down to the bay to be rescued - like no one ever heard of a tsunami, which would be so obvious with a 9+ earthquake. But guess this is not elementary knowledge to anyone around. And while buildings around keep collapsing like the architects would never even consider risk of an earthquake in SanFran, you see how Dwayne actually keeps stealing cars, boats just in order to save his two kids. And totally unpredictable - despite not having a way to contact them, he manages to find them. Better said - the kids use a laser pointer to signal him, but he and his wife took almost 2 minutes to actually look around and notice them, because yes, its so important to discuss - hey darling, whats this, oh, a green dot, lets pretend we are cats and try to catch it. Every normal person would virtually immediately turn around and look for the source. But considering how stupid everybody around acts, the viewer of this movie should not be surprised about that. And neither should be about the typical dumb ending of the movie - because - nothing is more important after a huge disaster, than to raise the US flag onto the collapsed Golden gate bridge - I mean - you guys have them always handy so that they can get raised immediately after disaster strikes?So, the real issue of this movie is, that there is never any suspense. There is never any association of the viewers with the poorly developed characters. The storyline is absolutely not entertaining and forgettable, CGI effects are nothing to write back home about. So unless you really want to torture yourself, just simply ignore this movie and watch something else",San Andreas
395,denise-hasircioglu,Disaster Masterpiece,10,14 September 2015,"The starting scene with the girl trapped in the car gave this movie a very explosive head start. Dwayne Johnson (Ray) is already the hero of the movie and I am anxious to see what will happen next.Special effects are amazing but this has become a norm in Hollywood nowadays so I can't weigh all my stars on that one. But something happened while I watched this beginning scene. A wave of intense suspense apprehended me. I don't know if it was the buffet of heavy sound effects and music or the expectation of what was to come but I was instantly engrossed and excited about the film.Some say the plot of a family trying to rescue each other is absorbed and 'been done before' but isn't this what anyone would do in a situation such as this? Your family becomes number one priority and what's better than a dad who is a search and rescue squadron? Utilizing every creative means of modern transport in California to save the one daughter he has left. However it seems logic was a bit lost on this movie. And maybe I just like finding the logic holes. But while everyone ran one way, the leading cast ran the other way, directly into the epitome of disaster. Making it all the more harder for Blake's parents to track her down. What also bothered me is during the telephonic call where they communicate their plans to meet at the Coit Tower. They had a secure line and enough time to make a plan B. Why didn't they? Instead Ray and Emma just had to guess where their daughter might go next and sail around aimlessly through the 49 square miles of flooded San Francisco. Eventually, with the creative use of a laser light. Their hearts full with hope that they will be reunited. Yay! But wait.. over all the barriers they broke through to get there, one wretched layer of glass stands between them. And for half an hour you watch as a re animated version of Titanic comes to life and suddenly the building is a sinking ship filling with water level by level. This is the part where the acting gets really genuine. Blake's drowning death is significantly spine-chilling, considering her sister died the exact same way. Ray takes some time to recover from the recall and gathers the strength to break through and rescue his daughter. When mother could have saved them the hassle and jetted through the window to begin with. All these logic flaws, unfortunate as they are, they make this movie. They add the story line as every movie has always done. If Emma and Blake didn't get themselves into all kinds of trouble then where would Ray be able to display his amazing heroic talent? I give it a 10 out of 10 because despite its flaws, this movie gave me a feeling that was notably powerful. Like I was there, experiencing the terror with them. That is very difficult to achieve so I commend the Director Brad Peyton. As well as Dwayne Johnson's role that fit him perfectly. Alexandra Daddario with her performance during the drowning scene and Carla Gugino when she sees her daughter is dead. Also the scientist played by Paul Giamatti when he witnesses the Hoover Dam go down and predicts the repercussions that will follow. Excellent acting. Excellent directing. Superb CGI, and an engaging topic.",San Andreas

I am saying far fetched because of the one second left saves done by the rock. But again, that's what the action movies are all about. I love the rock an most of the movies he does. Go into this movie knowing there will be some scenes you will roll your eyes at. To call it a comedy is not accurate at all.

401,bigconoruk,An earth-shaking sensation.,8,3 June 2015,"First off, I'm a big fan of disaster movies with big budgets like 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow. Today, these kind of disaster movies remain as icons of natural disasters on the the big screen. When San Andreas came out, I have to agree that this is definitely one of them or even a rebirth of the disaster movie canon.The performance of the cast was surprisingly spectacular. We have The Rock, Paul Giamatti and even Kylie Minogue! I think The Rock is the highlight of the film and really steals the show. The visual effects are, without a doubt, breathtaking and I've never seen any impressive destruction effects since 2012. The story, on the other hand, is... well... between okay and good. Although it's also slightly predictable but again, The Rock did really well in this story.To conclude, San Andreas pleased me in my disaster movie passion once again! If you're a big disaster movie fan like me, you should really watch this. After all, It's really worth a watch!Film Score: 8/10 - Great",San Andreas

She meets a boy called Ben and his strange brother who has not passed puberty and still is attracted to women, including Dwayne Johnson's daughter. Ben and Dwayne Johnson's daughter, Blake, fall in love, what a surprise! When Ben and Blake first kiss, the young boy says ""Mum is going to love her"" and in another moment when looking at Blake says ""I can't wait to be twenty."" I dare you to watch this movie and not hope that everyone will die, except for Ioan Gruffudd, this character was the only person I wanted to live because he was a snob to everyone!!!

Now before you science geeks start ripping this movie apart, remember it's just a popcorn movie. It's supposed to have cool special effects. It's supposed to have a hero. It's supposed to have some cheesy lines. But it also accomplished what it was set out to do which was give the audience a fun, wild ride. As far as character depth and Oscar-nominated acting, not needed in this one. A big natural disaster is about to hit. No time to think about how hurt this person is or why the rules aren't fair. And absolutely no time for a scientific explanation. Keep the action going and let's all do like Iron Maiden and run to the hills. Don't listen to most of the reviews on this one.

The acting was fine, the special effects were pretty good, and the suspense factor was high, but the story was AWFUL!If I did not know better, I would say this movie was made in a rush, as though someone at the top was about to drop it, so the producers hacked it together as quickly as possible.

And I mean - NOTHING. It's like somebody selling you a Jaguar and when you decide to pop the hood up, you find a two AA batteries instead of a powerful engine. A total let down. No plot, no action. 2012 level special effects, that we've all seen before ( mainly in 2012 and to a degree in The Day After Tomorrow),. The whole thing is so predictable and boring, that the only thing that kept me from switching it off earlier then I did ( ending was horrible), was hope that The Rock might do something worth watching.

409,Coury85,Oh the Rock...Can you do any wrong?,7,27 May 2015,"What an awesome and fun ride through the ""what if"" scenarios of some very real themed situations. Once again, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson can seemingly do no wrong (except for his corny role in Fast & Furious). The entire movie centers on his character and his shattered family after the loss of their child. As the story unfolds the layers to his character and introduces you to his job and expertise you feel the set up for what becomes a pretty believable character. As the audience embarks on this journey of tectonic plates and fault lines, the ""what if"" plays heavy on the connection to the film. I am still certain and have been long before this movie, California is one good earthquake from being an island so this movie worked for me! You get some necessary background information about what's going on whether you can truly understand most of it or not, you can see it's serious none the less. Out of no where the movie goes from going great to the start of the never ending series of coincidences and weird behavior that had to have been added just to make the story flow. *Spoiler Starts*Paul Giamatti plays Dr. Lawrence or Prof Lawrence at the school that is doing the research along with his partner Will Yun Lee as Dr. Park. They are the ones who have created the ability to predict earthquakes and the movie starts to dig in. While at the Hoover Dam, they realize they indeed can predict them but its a little too late for Dr. Park...in a terrible scripted event, he dies while saving a little girl who he throws across the falling bridge. It became very cliché and eye rolling worthy. Was it needed for him to die? Maybe but so lame, no! That I guess is what pushed Paul's character to dig deep to make their work stand for something. The movie from this point is a great ride but filled with a bunch of too close for comfort events that somehow still don't kill any of the important main characters. As buildings are falling, the ground is cracking, the sea is swelling and fires run amok, the mains just keep on pushing. Now The Rock is king of all things bad ass but dude, damn, you are one resume stacked veteran. In the movie he's LA Fire and Rescue and prior military Let me see if I can list all the things he is certified to do in bad ass fashion. -Helicopter Pilot -Rescue Jumper -Cessna Pilot -Certified Skydiver with tethering experience (somehow this one still got me because they didn't know they weren't going to be able to land the plane when they took it so I am sure he didn't check any gear that may or may not have already been in the plane. It was taken from a jump school but still, do you trust a randomly packed parachute that just was laying around? Ummmmm I don't, but for Hollywood, go ahead I suppose. -Expert Speed Boat operator along with his wife. (Cargo Ships are behind the swell and still don't make it but his speed boat does...I want that edition) -Expert diver because he can hold his breath forever. -Biggest yet most gentle CPR certified person in the world. (a normal person doing correct CPR cracks ribs on the individual they are trying to save and he does it on his little, cute, and large chested daughter Alexandra Daddario aka Blake for what seems forever. She wakes up eventually after a dramatic end to an almost telling story of two daughters killed by drowning tale. She's fine, no pain, walking and talking at the end like nothing ever happened. Now that could have been a good moment for a joke about her being all broken inside but hey, I am not the writer. -Expert survival teacher ( Blake and her friends only survived this movie because of the things her dad so called taught her. Oh and the fact her moms crappy boyfriend did one thing right, he built a strong skyline.)I think I have covered his roles in the film but I am sure I am missing something. Don't get me wrong, I still really enjoyed the film and it's awesome 3D graphics but if I didn't find any fault, it just wouldn't be right. I would watch this again over many of the films I a have seen this year. Great for the family, those who enjoy a thrill, and sci-fi enthusiasts.

410,dolphin888,"Same old, same old, but worse!",1,24 September 2015,"Can I give it zero? I have said this for years about disaster films: they all have the same plot line. Somewhere at the beginning there will be a failed relationship, one that usually has a child or two involved as well. From there (not saying it happens here), the ex- couple will struggle to save their child, with usually the man becoming the hero of the day, so that Mom and Dad will be together again with their child/ren. This was such a horrible, horrible movie!!! Reminds me of when 3D movies came out in the early 80's - bad movies where they tried to throw everything and anything at the screen, but lacked a story. Since CGI effects came on the scene, it seems many bad movies, like this one, think they can overcome a badly written movie by making some awesome effects. It will work for most of the do-do's out there, but otherwise will fall flat for most. I should add, that ""hey! I ain't looking for something too deep, but for God's sake, use your imagination a bit folks...folks being the ones who are writing this garbage!Extremely shameful!!!",San Andreas

From some of the reviews which nit pick tiny details or inaccuracies, that's not what movies are about and have not been since the days of Max Sennet or the Keystone Cops. It's all about the improbable brought to the screen, lighten up people!
The film follows a fairly standard formula, a back story, action coupled with great special effects. An unlikely hero saving the girl, the cowardly step father and reunion of the main characters which are nicely handled

The film was exceptionally well created and thought out.The casting was great and every actor/actress seemed to fit their role wonderfully. You could tell no one was trying to ""over do it"" and I was again surprised at how well the filmed turned out with almost no A- list celebrities (except for The Rock and Paul Giamatti). The writing was also well done and not so cheesy as some of The Rock's previous films. The CGI special affects were amazing and the unlike anything else I've seen before. One thing I found satisfactory was the sub-plot. The whole ""parent traveling a great distance and through tremendous obstacles to save their child"" has already been seen before with 'The Day After Tomorrow'. Then again the film could have gone in another direction with a sub-plot similar to that of '2012' but we know what a disaster that was.Overall I give this film an 8/10. All things considered, The Rock and the rest of the cast did a create job, the film was well written and produced, and extremely detailed. Apocalyptic/disaster movies are nothing new and neither are Dwayne Johnson action films but I think you'll be surprised.

The acting is absolutely horrific, the rock has the acting ability of a disabled fox and I wanted the two English toff kids to die every time they appeared on the screen.The girl in it, although very attractive, has the personality of a sprout.Bah! if anyone offers to watch this movie in your presence please punch them in the face.The ending where the rock says something like ""now we rebuild"" and the American flag unfurls in the wind made me want to spew my popcorn all over the cinema floor.Avoid at all costs.",San Andreas

And I do love Dwayne, he's just so lovable....So that sums up my 4 rating...Now for why I think it's a 1.... If you are looking for a good disaster movie, on the cheesy side, I would recommend something else. The only character whom I thought actually had soul in this wasn't any the leading roles, but actually the young sidekick brother Ollie who, for me, actually had good lines and showed a different personality than what you would expect. Every other character in the movie was so 1 dimensional that the cheesy lines didn't even seem to be cheesy... just bad writing. Sure the falling buildings were well done... but with that kind of cash for a movie, who can't do crazy awesome dramatic explosions and effects and such. I find it a shame that Hollywood truly thinks that no original plot (I mean come on... California breaking off has been done so many times...), mediocre acting and 2 cute women in 2 different age groups is enough for a good movie... Sorry did forget to add the Rock, the good-guy who's life is not great but hey, he can still smile and be an awesome dad...then go save the world... err California. But oh yeah, hey, he didn't save anybody except his family!!!! What a dou***bag. His job is to save lives in a helicopter, the first scene we see him putting his life on the line to save a kid, so we know he's the bada** guy you want to save you.

Nowhere to land but why the hell bother? The mother of all tsunamis is racing toward the city? Jump on a fast boat to try to go behind before it crests. A wife and daughter tough as nail? Lucky man. At least they're worth saving in my book, not like all those idiots who run toward the bay. And why not a little miracle to boot. And, finally, a huge American flag unfurling, brand new, to inspire rebuilding. It would have been much better if it would have been at least a little wet. All in all, good fun. Good CGI.

OK, the CGI are almost well done. The 3D starts well, but, as often, there's a lack of good use of this technology after the half of the movie.

420,bonekeep,Better when you don't expect much...,7,7 June 2015,"When you ask your daughter to pick the movie we're gonna go see together, you don't question it. So, with an open-mind and belly full of dumplings, we made our way to this Dwayne Johnson natural disaster flick. Honestly, it was actually a decent movie. Plenty of over-the-top CGI, and plenty of silly dialogue for sure, but as a So Cal native living under the shadow of ""the big one"", it's easy to get drawn into the visuals of super quakes over 9.0 hitting along the San Andreas fault line. Now, if you're gonna make a movie about giant slabs of rock you have to cast a giant slab named The Rock (thank you... I'll be here all week... please tip your waitress). Actually, Johnson was called upon to do some serious acting as part of a plot line that required him to portray the pain of a father tortured by his guilt in the death of a daughter in the past, and he indeed did a terrific job. Other performances were equally good, most notably Carla Gugino's breasts and Alexandra Daddario's breasts. I could totally see the pitch meeting for this movie: ""Sure there'll be top notch special effects and plenty of excitement, but dammit if the earth is gonna be shaking with this much ferocity... we need BOOBS!"" So, if you don't care to see what ""the big one"" would look like, or care to smell what The Rock is cooking, at least you get plenty boobies (no nudity though... don't expect something akin to 13 year old me's favorite scene in Airplane). I rolled my eyes more than a few times for sure, but it was worth the watch.SPOILERS: 1. The best part of the movie was watching AT&T ballpark destroyed... suck it Giants. 2.

The script is wretched, the action is completely unrealistic. All acting talent the performers could must is woefully insufficient to cover the ridiculously juvenile script design. From the very first scene of a girl, a car, a mountain road, and the ridiculous tumble down a mountainside, the movie wreaks of over-reaching effects and underdeveloped characters. This movie ranks right down there with Rambo and Missing In Action. My wife said it best...hokey.",San Andreas
422,JeffBatHome,A cliffhanger from the first scenes but geologically improbable or impossible,6,8 June 2015,"I liked this movie. I might even go see it again, but in 3D.""San Andreas"" is a CG-heavy disaster movie plain and simple. If you go see it for the story or the characters you will be disappointed. The characters are likable enough (even the bad guy is merely a coward but not evil) and the plot and dialog are predictable. I found myself sometimes saying what the actors said before they said it.However ""San Andreas"" has more cliffhangers per minute than any other movie I can think of. It starts off with a literal cliffhanger to introduce the main character, Ray (Dwayne Johnson). Ray is a man who knows precisely what to do in almost every deadly situation which, in the beginning of the movie, means dropping down on ropes from a hovering helicopter (which he also pilots) to rescue a young woman from a car which is hanging on a cliff. A literal cliffhanger.The remainder of this movie is one disaster after another which shoot at you with machine-gun rapidity from which only Ray and his disaster-savvy daughter, Emma (Alexandra Daddario), her young engineer friend, Burt (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) and his bright side-kick brother, Ollie (Art Parkinson), can escape from again and again while rescuing themselves and others along the way. ""San Andreas"" is the movie version of the old saying, ""Life favors the prepared.""Which brings me to my major criticism of this movie. ""San Andreas"" is geologically WRONG. The San Andreas fault can AND WILL create major carnage in California but it cannot deliver a 9.1 earthquake, let alone a 9.6 earthquake. Furthermore the San Andreas is a ""strike-slip"" fault, so it moves sideways, not up and down, and so it CANNOT create a large tsunami like that depicted in the movie.If you want to make a film about a REAL 9+ earthquake and tsunami you should make it about people living along the coast of the Pacific Northwest, anywhere from northern California up past Oregon and Washington state right up into Canada. The Cascadia Subduction Zone runs along that entire portion of the west coast of the North America. It WILL deliver an 8.8 to a 9.1 earthquake which will devastate the Pacific Northwest coast first with the BIGGEST earthquake we can have in the US and then with a tsunami equal to the 2011 Japan tsunami. The only question is when and how bad (8.8 if half of it rips or a 9.1 if all of it rips). Contrary to the movie no one has yet figured out how to say exactly when an earthquake will occur on any given fault.If there is one actually good thing about this movie it is that it MIGHT get people to think a little more about disaster preparedness.The San Andreas fault and the Cascadia Subduction Zone will cause DEVASTATION for which we as a nation are ill prepared. Example: Building codes consider a building to be a success if it does not collapse during an earthquake. But can the building be USED after an earthquake? Building codes are mostly silent on that. With really big earthquakes vast number of buildings will be rendered unusable (or collapse completely) resulting in loss of housing, work places, and other infrastructure thus dealing a devastating NATIONAL ECONOMIC DISASTER on top of the earthquake disaster.I hope ""San Andreas"" will make people think more about being prepared, because preparedness is our only defense against earthquakes and other disasters.",San Andreas

Howard Stern's former boss, Pig Vomit taking charge is perhaps the most hilarious thing about this movie. Seeing numerous people having their day/lives ruined in the most outrageous ways was also fodder for extended hilarity.There were one or two heart-warming moments, such as when The Rock's character risked breaking his daughter's ribs to save her from drowning.The aerial shots were breathtaking, and reminded me of my days as an Image Analyst in the U.S. Army.As a military man who has been through a divorce, and who has witnessed numerous other military personnel go through bitter divorces, I could relate to what The Rock's character was going through.My wife and I both enjoyed this movie in 3D, and we agree that 3D movie technology has come a long way since we saw our first 3D movie, A Christmas Carol, in 2009.I look forward to buying the DVD version of this film and watching it repeatedly!",San Andreas

426,keithbenicek,Oh yeah this film IS a Disaster ...........,1,29 May 2015,"Movie Review: (the best I can do) . San Andreas - Highly Fictional ... no Delusional, redux of so many awful mega California Quake films with Cheezy Absurd over the top special effects and horrible acting by ""Down the"" Dwayne Johnson who couldn't act his way out of a wet paper bag, laughable line deliveries by Paul Giamatti and Carla Gugino who used to be good actors. This is supposed to be a Mega Disaster Epic, and that it is ... an Epic Mega Disaster of a laugh. Apparently the writers never consulted a single Scientist in the improbable script for this dumb movie. You would be better served taking your $25 for two tickets and buying Lotto Tickets, which have a better chance of actually happening as advertised. They should have billed this laugh fest as a comedy. 1/2 a Popcorn cold for this Mega Dud of a Apocalyptic Film. And that is the View from the Balcony - KB (c) (tm) 2015",San Andreas
427,phillipd97,Rushed.,7,30 May 2015,"The movie from the beginning instantly grabs our attention with a sudden accident, the man who comes to the rescue is Dwayne Johnson. He does this time and time again in the movie and overall Dwaynes acting is pretty good, which the same can be said with the rest of the cast.Another positive with the movie was the special effects watching this in the cinema, I did enjoy the special effects even more. However thats where the positives end.What really hurt this movie was the storyline, every 10 seconds in the movie I felt there was something new happening, sometimes it was another building falling or another random civilian getting crushed by falling debris, it was always something a lot of scenes in the movie weren't even needed, and the parts that I thought were needed to give the storyline depth are rushed and the movie is thrown into another unneeded complication. I think this movie had to much action, which in my opinion usually spoils a movie, it defiantly spoiled this movie. There is having a complication, like having to steer a boat over a massive tsunami then over complicating a scene by adding a huge carrier ship which they then have to navigate through. Overall to sum of the movie, if you have seen 2012 then there basically the same thing except a different family and a different kind of storyline, as long as you don't go into the cinema with your expectations to high like I did, will you get what you paid for.",San Andreas
428,smspencer69,Surprisingly Good Disaster Movie,7,29 May 2015,"I went in to this with admittedly very low expectations, however I genuinely enjoyed the 2 hour action packed adventure. The premise is not exactly original; following the worst earthquake in history The Rock, a helicopter rescue pilot, sets out to rescue his ex-wife and then with her help his daughter.The science is not too shaky (if you'll forgive the pun); major earthquake along the San Andreas fault is not beyond the bounds of possibility and the scientists subplot is only mildly irritating and does not detract from the action much.And there's a lot of action! The Rock + ex-wife and daughter + friends bounce from one disaster to the next, barely scraping though intact in their request to re-unite. Each of these near-misses are edge of the seat stuff - you know at the back of your mind they're going to get through it but still you find yourself holding your breath each time. The stunts are excellent and the special effects are brilliant in their realism - yeah they're a bit over the top but it genuinely looks like they destroyed San Francisco in their quest to make this film.It's not Shakespeare and no-one is expecting any of the leads to win best actor at next years Oscars for this but Dwayne proves a strong lead with the rest of the cast doing an amiable job with the exception of Aussie actor Hugo Johnstone-Burt who seems to be doing a Lee Evans impression in his attempt to play a Brit.If you like disaster movies you'll love this; everyone else switch your brain in to neutral and enjoy the thrill ride!",San Andreas
429,spam-917-215663,Cliché filled stream of p#ss into the viewers face,4,2 June 2015,"This movie is just ridiculous. It's a movie in which every man is portrayed either as a wimp or an a**hole - except DWAYNE of course. He's the man who taught his supermodel-type daughter with big knockers all about survival and emergency routines and she actually seems to have been paying attention to his valuable life-lessons. And then there's this kid that has more wits and balls than his big brother.. Sorry, but all the reviewers glorifying this flick just have no standards anymore. Sure the CGI of collapsing buildings, fiery explosions and a big tsunami wave are somewhat entertaining but everything else is just a blatant orgy of clichés. And some of it is just.. incredibly stupid. An example would be DWAYNE's daughter informing this guy and his little brother about emergency situation radio channels that rescue services use to communicate. REALLY??? THEY COMMUNICATE USING RADIO CHANNELS? WOW! WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT! And that ""rare known bit of information"" is one of the arguments to stick with her instead of doing something else. Come on! I don't know what the writers, the director, DWAYNE and the big knockers were thinking when they decided to create this weak, yes DWAYNE, very WEAK movie.My suggestion: watch it when you're really, really bored and there's nothing else to do.

430,Cake15,A movie of coincidence and luck,5,2 June 2015,"Don't get me wrong, this movie was excellent in terms of graphics. They were visually stunning. The storyline was alright considering the possibility of it happening is much higher than other event movies that have taken place. The problem is the coincidences and luck that happened in this movie. Everyone wants a happy ending and I think that's the problem. Sometimes happy endings just aren't going to exist. Therefore, the creators made something realistic into something unrealistic.The relationship between the family is undeniably strong but I feel it was too focused on that. Why can't there be a single guy saving the world? Or a female? I'm personally tired of movies where the middle it turns into a life/death situation to keep the family together. It honestly reminded me of Titanic but with skyscrapers instead of a boat since they focus on a certain building being ""the strongest"" skyscraper of them all.I gave it 5/10 due to the graphics ONLY.",San Andreas
431,larsviebrock,"Alternative Title: ""Dwayne Johnson's Day Off""",3,25 November 2015,"Okay, where do I start with this one... It's a ""Natural Disaster Movie"" as we know hundreds of, but this one is especially bad. I can't say I like this genre too much anyways. The Day after Tomorrow, 2012, Deep Impact, Armageddon, Indépendance Day... I've seen many and while not really loving any of those, they were all a bazillion times better than this cinematic mess. The Plot: The earthquake starts way to abrupt for my taste and leaves no room for excitement to develop. So, we follow a family consisting of a mother, her daughter, the (super rich) step-dad and the biological dad, played by Dwayne aka. ""The Rock"" Johnson. The plot is already super predictable, they will somehow get rid of the step-dad, parents get back together, all (apart of the step-dad) survive and live on happily... And exactly that happened! The Rock plays a LA-helicopter pilot for the fire brigade, and on the worst day ever in Los Angeles, what does he do? Use his amazing helicopter flying skills to rescue hundreds of lives from dying in the collapsing buildings in one of the world's highest populated metropole and become a hero. Or instead,steal a helicopter from the fire department, fly 6 hours to San Fransisco, to rescue two lives and his own ass, while passing by thousands of dying civilians and not helping anyone at all.... As you might have guessed, he chooses the latter. For what he has done that day (or rather hasn't done) they should take him to court, letting hundreds die while stealing a helicopter desperately needed... Well, sounds great, doesn't it. The characters: it doesn't get much better right here. I don't want to sound racist, but I really don't see how this girl is supposed to be the daughter of these two people... and apart from the rigorous cast, the characters are crazily one dimensional. The step-dad for example is plain evil. With zero heart, mercy or regret... which of cause justifies cheating on him. Verdict: Awful movie, one dimensional characters and a hero, who never does anything hero-like. Watch the movie if you have zero expectations and have two hours of spare time you really want to waste in the most stupid way possible. Otherwise, omit this cinematic rubbish and go for a post apocalyptic movie instead, they are usually better. (I am Legend, 28 days later...)",San Andreas

The Rock, who plays a firefighter, sets out to rescue his family after a powerful earthquake hits San Francisco. In some ways, this movie looks like an imitation of 2012 (2012). There are similar computer generated scenes of massive destruction, aircraft maneuvering through falling buildings, massive tsunami waves carrying ships onto land and so on. Acting is just fine, plot is very narrow, and overall the movie is full of cinematic clichés. Nevertheless, watching it on big screen in 3D is definitely going to thrill the audience.",San Andreas

The action scenes and CGI were as expected quite entertaining and impressive but to have everything crumble instantly after they leave that spot is too much. The main Characters are stuck in an impossible situation, they manage to escape with seconds to spare. its so predictable. Obviously Dwayne Johnson is going to save everyone in the most ridiculous ways but i expected that and he is an entertaining actor. The final scene of the American flag blowing in the wind as Dwayne Johnson remarks 'we rebuild' is the cherry on top of the cake. This like Battle of Los Angeles is a typical proud American film. One nation can overcome everything with heroes everywhere. Its extremely cheesy and every quiet moment has of course have a heartfelt moment which brings the characters closer.

441,jarcheese2012,Could this be the worst film of the year so far? Without question it is.,1,1 September 2015,"San Andreas is truly a disaster of monumental proportions.The main character, Ray (Dwayne Johnson), is a divorced Search and Rescue helicopter pilot who is still in love with his estranged wife. Not only can he fly helicopters, he can also fly light aircraft and drive speedboats at the drop of a hat. In fact, he can do anything and if the scriptwriters (and I use that term loosely) hadn't been able to provide a vehicle for him they would probably have given him the power of unaided flight. His estranged wife is about to move in with a mega-rich architect, who you are pretty sure will turn into a cowardly arsehole and meet a predictably sticky end. His daughter has no personality knows everything about survival, something which, I assume, she has gained from her father by means of osmosis. His daughter's love interest (Hugo Johnstone-Burt), a young British man (and by British I mean someone who is not British but is putting on an obviously fake British accent) who, despite being an engineer, is fairly stupid and follows her like a homeless dog would follow a tramp with bacon in his pocket. He also has an annoying kid brother. The love interest's kid brother (Art Parkinson), is so annoying that you desperately want to see him die in horrific and (preferably) painful circumstances at the earliest opportunity, but unfortunately he doesn't.The main characters are all rich, WASPish and thoroughly dislikeable, and bear no resemblance to anyone you would want to care about. Or meet. Ever.There is no plot to speak of, just a series of unbelievable escapes that takes suspension of disbelief to a whole new level. In one scene Ray's estranged wife is having lunch in a restaurant on the top floor of a skyscraper (where else?)when an earthquake hits. She phones Ray, who is about a hundred miles away and who tells her to head to the roof and wait for him.Ray flies to her rescue, ignoring all the other people requiring his assistance and when he gets there the building is starting to collapse. As she runs toward the helicopter the roof caves in and she falls about six storeys down, but amazingly she survives enough to run up the rubble and jump on to the helicopter. Now, all this would have been fine if her character had for years been hiding her secret identity of Supergirl from her husband, but unfortunately she isn't the Man of Steel's unnecessary cousin. This is a woman who has just come from living the high life of the idle rich, and let's be honest here, if you were a Search and Rescue pilot whose wife had (presumably) been shagging this mega-rich arsehole for months and was about to move into his grand house with him, a house, by the way, that you could never afford in a million years on your measly Search and Rescue pilot salary, would you go out of your way to rescue her? I know I wouldn't. I'd be hovering over her rooftop rescue point in my helicopter shouting, ""Burn bitch! You had it coming!""The scene on the rooftop with Ray and his estranged wife takes place within the first thirty minutes of this CGI-heavy film, and as it plods inexorably and excruciatingly on the situations get progressively ridiculous and unbelievable. It's all spectacle and no substance, and the spectacle's nothing to write home about because the special effects are nothing you haven't seen before in other superior disaster movies. When are the people who produce these insults to intelligence going to realise that CGI effects are not a replacement for a solid screenplay and good acting.But what about the dialogue? Well, I know this is difficult to believe, but it's even worse.When Ray is whinging on about how he couldn't save his daughter from drowning (that's the first one than drowned), his wife says to him, ""If you couldn't save her, Ray, no-one could.""Really? I bet they could have. An Olympic swimmer probably could have. Or a dolphin. Besides, throughout the film Ray proves that he's a pretty useless Search and Rescue pilot, choosing only to save members of his immediate family and annoying numpties with fake British accents. I wanted to include all the bad dialogue in the film in this review, but that would have meant printing out the entire screenplay, and I didn't have time for that.The worst chunk of dialogue comes right at the end of the film. Ray's estranged wife looks at him with dreamy eyes (that's right, she's fallen in love with him again because he's so MANLY) and asks, ""What now?"" And, as the Stars and Stripes unfurls before him, he replies, ""Now we rebuild."" Yeah, woo-hoo! Let's take the dumbest film of the year and add a bit of patriotism into the mix to make it doubly dumb.I wish the San Andreas Fault had split open and swallowed up every extant copy of San Andreas.

You're going in there for the special effects and incredible moments of tension. Does 'San Andreas' deliver these core elements? Yes, very much so. In one word, the movie feels 'tight', as in tightly made. No needless exposition, or characters that shouldn't be there, everything on the screen works for it's place. The actors look natural in their roles. Dwayne Johnson surprised me with his abilities as an actor, the emotions of his character were real. In fact, he was the best of the lot. The special effects are done well. For a moment I thought to myself 'they've really taken time to get it right and make it realistic to a real earthquake or tsunami' because they have. Again, the plot is not the core element but it works. I won't say anything about it, except for this; while it's something we've seen before, it's done well and made interesting.

I'm telling you that as a European guy who's pretty highly educated, visits real, brick and mortar theaters often and watches movies with intricate plots.

People making it out just before the building collapses, people getting stuck under something, then getting rescued by the guy that didn't abandon you.

Later that night I watched this movie and found it extremely average. I am a big fan of ""The Rock"" and think he is a great actor. His role in the Fast and Furious series is one of the books but his role in this movie is pretty typical. He plays a L.A. fire and rescue pilot captain and he also has to two daughters. One daughter died before the setting in the movie but the other daughter is heading to college. The Rocks character is a father who what do you know is going through a divorce, it seems like all movies made these days have parents that are doing through a divorce. Anyway, as the movie's main plot starts to take shape, the state of California gets turned into ruble and everyone is in trouble. Raymond Gaines aka ""The Rock"" has to save is wife from a collapsing building, which he does valiantly. After that the whole is about Ray and wife running/flying around trying to find his daughter and rescue her. The movie can be summed up in this little paragraph, which to me points out that its an average movie. Buildings are falling down everywhere, the earth is shaking and the water is rising. The tech crew did an excellent job making this movie. The effects are outstanding, but now days that is expected, its the plot that makes or beaks a movie. I feel that the plot needed to be more complex and not just your generic search and rescue. When you have a great actor like Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson staring in a movie I expect an intense plot with dramatic turns and really throughout rescues, not just your average grab my hand and I will save you type of rescues. Overall the whole idea about the fault lines changes was great and ordinal but the plot was pretty average.",San Andreas

455,erinouellette,Not bad,7,7 April 2016,I have read a lot of negative reviews about this movie and while I agree on some points I found the movie pretty good! A lot of people have pointed out that Ray (Dwyane Johnson) should have helped others while searching for his daughter because that is his job. Yes... that is his job however if that was your job and your daughter was in horrible danger you would probably do the same thing! It's human nature to protect your children and the ones you love first. and once in San Francisco he did help others.Although I did find the acting a bit wooden and the near death scenes totally unbelievable ( who the heck falls 6 stories and still survives with only minor scrapes and bruises I dunno) I liked the storyline though and the visual effects were awesome! Pretty typical disaster movie.,San Andreas

457,stanward,Solid movie,8,6 April 2018,"Sure the film is not meant for a huge complex audience or even to win awards, it's meant to be a feel good, suspenseful action disaster movie. There was a lot of negative critical reviews but I, personally, can't see what or where that has come from. The CGI is good and realistic. The plot is fairly solid and the acting is good. Dwayne johnsons performance is good. So are the other cast members. Overall the age rating to the film is agreeable. The violence is not too graphic but not suitable for audiences under 10. Language isn't perfect with one f word and other milder profanity. The film is very intense throughout. Overall my verdict to the film is that it is a very good, feel good, emotional, rollercoaster thrill ride of a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat.",San Andreas
458,borhankhan01,Why San Andreas,7,29 March 2017,"I really enjoyed this Movie. And I watched this movie more than 5 times. Dwayne Johnson was really very cool in this movie. His acting level was fantastic. And I also enjoy the present of Alexandra Daddario. She was looking very much pretty and Sexy. I like her Acting skill too. The film has many times of suspension. When the first earth quack come I think it's over but when the earth quack is happening again again it makes the viewers excited and tensed. The scripting and story line up is too good. The most important thing is in this film, Location design and Camera framing. Actually I think so Director is like a scientist, I feel so after watching this movie. Love This movie.",San Andreas

Have this lousy movie play in the background while you are making out with your GF/BY or as you are doing work around the house.Its not worth your full attention as the acting is bad, the scenes are about as realistic as Star Wars, the CGI leaves a lot to be desired and the plot is so blatantly predictable.",San Andreas
463,yomba,concrete vs. metal cracking,5,7 October 2015,"Just an observation. Reinforced concrete has a certain way of cracking. Metal suffer entirely different kind of damage. In the movie the concrete buildings cracks quite realistic. But at one point we see a big ship tilted, supported by a building. And the boat has the same type of damage as if it were made from concrete, not metal.Perhaps CGI team is not aware of material properties. Or perhaps they believed that viewers are too ignorant to notice the difference. I do not like being taken for a fool, that upsets me terribly. In a film that's all about special effects, it is inexcusable the ignorance of these details.",San Andreas
464,britishgoose01,such a good ideas turned bad,6,1 September 2015,"This film, I have been waiting ages to watch this....Finally I have watched it. awww the disappointment. The films storyline is kinda the same as 2012, family split, fathers to the rescue, other characters become main cast and survive till the end. It looks like they spent a lot on effects and they are extremely realistic. Visually it was stunning but then we have the actors and the terrible plot lines and this let the film down badly. There was stories which ended without finding out what was gonna happen, Dwayne has been in some OK films so we know he can act but goddamn this was terrible, he over acted making me wana grind my teeth. Poor jokes, stupid love scenes. abserlutely daft. Then there was the English child and the English older brother. Now personally beig a Brit and living here for over 30+ years...We do not speak all posh, were they American actors putting on So thern accents? they were terrible and made the older brother look like an idiot every time he talked. In fact soe of the famous actors in this film were terrible....all I can think the director should have been changed. This was one of the corniest films I've ever seen. Like in Arnies earlier days there would always be funny corny lines, well this was just all bad.....am being very generous giving it 4/10 terrible film Oh and enough of the stupid American flags in every film.....very annoying",San Andreas

466,rolle-hacksell,One of the better disaster movies i've seen,5,31 May 2015,"First of all - It's a disaster and action movie, not a drama, so action and disasters are what you get. But San Andreas is actually an exciting movie. It's by no means unpredictable nor original, but hey, it's a disaster movie. What did you expect? So, whats so great about this one? Well, it's got a fairly plausible story (which is unusual), some relevant dialog(really!), character development (I sh*t you not) and a really cool babe! The thing that really makes San Andreas stand out are the CGIs. Just watching the animators trash LA and SF should be worth you money. All those small details in the overviews - cars at collapsing bridges, the school bus at golden gate, people in the boats - are brilliant. And watching Daddario swimming under water is ehh.. fun! The down part is that it's basically a carbon copy of the generic disaster movie script. With great CGIs..",San Andreas

But then the more I got into it the more it felt like watching 2012...the effects were good but the story was bland and a lot of non-realistic events. I will say this movie was action packed. Dwayne Johnson did good at being is ""hard"" self. I will say the story line to this movie was better then 2012, only for the sake there was more of a developed plot. A lot of up and down climaxes which made it interesting to watch throughout, but the movie did have its dull moments. All around, just watch it. I see a lot of mixed reviews and it comes down to what taste you have in movies. As for me, I'm glad I saw it. It was good, just not really good. But I probably won't watch it again.",San Andreas
468,MattTheNoble,Only watchable because of The Rock,7,14 June 2015,"San Andreas is just another disaster movie, but it's a surprisingly satisfying one. We are given an introduction to The Rock's character, a superhero of a fire and rescue helicopter pilot whose marriage is on the rocks and a cannot spend enough time with his college bound daughter. You know, the everyman's problems. What follows that introduction is a series of events only plausible on the SyFy channel where sharks can be picked up in a waterspout and attack cities like Chicago. The San Andreas faultline is obviously a threat (see the history books) but the wise Paul Giamatti tells us in San Andreas that even more destructive and horrifying events could occur at anytime. The film is quite predictable, even to the point of where you can write down lines of dialogue you think likely and the characters will quote them verbatim. Even so, it is still funny and entertaining. Mostly because Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is so fun to watch, the plot progression avoids the areas of complete quotidian filmmaking (Quick aside here, I ) Even the supporting cast have more dimensions and more depth than the cast of say, Godzilla or The Day After Tomorrow. There are of course plenty of problems with this movie. I am not trying to diminish the total stupidity of what occurs during those two hours. I laughed out loud numerous times during the film, and I think that is what this movie will become: a favorite amongst groups of friends who stayed up too late, drank too much, and are just looking for a great and humorous action flick. This is an ultra-high budget, earthquake version of Sharknado. But there is a place for that, and this movie does not take itself so seriously that you cannot enjoy the cheese along with the sights.",San Andreas
469,guy-noland,"I must have been watching a different ""San Andreas""...",2,29 May 2015,"I'm stumped, nay baffled, by the reviews on this film. I'm reading things like ""great action film"" and ""entertaining ride,"" all the while thinking to myself, ""are they referring to the same piece of rubbish I just suffered through?"" Clearly, I must have been watching a different San Andreas (for the record, I was watching the one with Dwayne Johnson).Fortunately, I had low expectations going in. Usually, this means I will wind up enjoying the film more, as most (bad) films succeed in at least trumping my poorest of predictions. No such luck with San Andreas... it actually wound up MORE disappointing than my lowest of the low expectations.The cheesy ""on the nose"" writing took me by surprise, until I realized that the screenwriter's (Cuse) IMDb page consists solely of cheesy ""on the nose"" TV shows. Riddled with exposition, forced situations, a weak and dodgy plot, and cliché's that dropped as regularly as the buildings, the script left little to be desired. The story bounces around so much it's difficult to sympathize (much less follow) any of the one-note characters, not even the heroic Mr. Johnson. I never imagined there would exist a script that could make even the great Paul Giamatti look bad. Well done, Mr. Cuse. Well done.The whole experience left me looking at my watch, and for an exit, by the midpoint. Sad to say, I suffered through to the end, hoping things would turn around. No such luck.",San Andreas
470,kevincoleman37,Why a ten and why you should see it while in theaters.,10,31 May 2015,"This move gets a 10 simply because it does everything it set out to do and does it well. In fact, very well. I don't know of any disaster film that comes close to this. There is no bogus 40 minute long back story prior to the action, and all the characters are developed just enough when there is a brief pause in the action. This is the Rock's movie, and that's a good thing. I won't say he's a great actor but - as he instructed so many others to do while he was in the WWE wrestling biz - he knows his role. The guy has a screen presence as big as Arnold or Stallone ever had and he can speak well. I won't tell any stuff that goes on, but some times there is so much happening on screen I was glad to be seeing on the big screen. One thing I will say is that I watched the whole movie without finding any flaws or disappointing moments. there are a lot of great movies that you can simply wait and see on DVD, or on a PC or whatever. This should be seen big screen. It is a very well crafted piece of work and entertains better than probably most other movies that will be released this summer.",San Andreas
471,arnoldas-dektukas,"I didn't expected much, but certainly more than that",5,30 May 2015,"Before going to see this film, I watched trailers, took a look at the basic plot and I already knew that the scenario will be empty and cliché. I knew that I will see a lot of scenes that do not make sense, or characters are going to be as in usual Hollywood film: plain, heroic and very very smart then it is needed. So I sad to myself: look, you're not going for the smart, plot-twisted film; you're going to check the effects. I was disappointed by them. For me 2012 film was way more fascinating, breath-taking film than this one. I almost did not see anything new what I already saw in the trailer. I wanted to experience the disaster on its best: with good views, observations, with scary soundtrack that will bring the fear and terror to everyone's hearts and imagination. Instead of that, I've got a lot of mess, only few points of views about the disaster and nothing that actually made me say WOW. It just didn't feel like I was watching something that I did not see already. And I thought that after some break of disaster movies in cinemas, they will definitely deliver something different. Unfortunately.I rate this film 5, and I do not regret my money spent on the ticket in the cinema, because I like disaster films generally.

472,aha060,Sharknado with a much larger budget,1,7 November 2015,"While Sharknado was meant to be good fun San Andreas was meant to be all serious. The quality of the stories are the same but where Sharknado was meant to be fun San Andreas is just plain ridiculous and stupid. When some of the reviewers say that San Andreas is a good disaster movie they must have been seeing something I did not see. Yes, the destruction of the city looks good but when they mix in scenes so unrealistic and stupidly heroish it all falls apart. I guess they intended to add at least some realism to the movie but there is not a scene in the movie that even comes close to being realistic.OMG! Did I mention the acting and the dialogue? It's not worth the energy talking about it. See it for yourself and cry (or laugh if you like pain).I want to see ""Sharknado in San Andreas"". That could have been a good movie. As long as it is not intended to be taken seriously. Because that is not what San Andreas is. It basically sucks and is nowhere near being realistic.",San Andreas

475,alexsearle7848,Dumb but fun !!!!,6,1 June 2015,The difference between any other disaster movie we have had in the past 10 years and San Andreas is simply Dywane Johnson. Dywane Johnson is one of a very few actors that no matter how ridiculous the movie is you still have an awesome time watching his performance and that is what makes San Andreas so fun. Don't go into the movie expecting a realistic story of survival because this movie is all about great action and visually stunning shots of cities turned to rubble. If you are looking for a movie with great dialogue and compelling storyline then this isn't the movie for you but if you want to see Dywane Johnson take on an earthquake while eating popcorn and letting your brain switch off from reality then this movie is exactly what you are looking for. 6/10.. had a good time but wont be in any rush to see this movie again.,San Andreas

San Andreas is obviously the latter and my entire family simply loved it.Like all action movies, you have to suspend some belief and avoid taking it too seriously. However, within the realm of disbelief, San Andreas stays believable and you find yourself pulling for the characters to make it .. which isn't as obvious as you might think. Special effects are downright spectacular while avoiding going over the top.If you're looking for a night of fun at the movies with friends or family in the next couple of weeks, San Andreas is a 10 ... not an Oscar 10 ... but a fun, thrill ride 10.",San Andreas

Yes, the dialogue may be cheesy, and it may be easy to tell if there is green screen sometimes, but the action and spectacle of the entire thing just repays for those errors. The Rock is awesome as always, and I particularly enjoyed the English brothers that helped Blake throughout the earthquake. Kylie Minogue has a great cameo as the sister of an idiot and Paul Giamati seemed like he was having so much fun. There were some great lines (Emma's death threat to Daniel) . Another problem I had with the film was that during the action sequences, it favoured the shaky cam over a still camera, but if you're in the air, it's kind of inevitable to have slightly shaky cam, right? Overall a fun time, and if you're the fan of the rock, it's a must.*spoiler* Lots of people die.",San Andreas

Cliché after cliché with heroes and villains and plucky snot nosed side-kick brats and pretty, young, nubile daughters make up this predictable turd of a film.

Both of which are horribly cast, plastic coated Californians lounging poolside and enjoying the finer things in life and then... Disaster strikes! There is no connection with these characters and you just don't care if they live or die, I was hoping for the latter in every case.Oh, and there's the ""expert"" quoting countless geologists from the discovery channel who conveniently and of course, narrowly escapes death dozens of times only to unfailingly ""know"" what's about to happen, sadly, just after it happens.

Dwayne Johnson, Carla Guigino and Alexandra Daddario look great, and do well with what they're given to work with.What the actors are given is a script so thin on story and character development you could almost perform microsurgery with it. Clichés and cardboard characters are the last thing I expected from one of the show runners of Lost.All isn't beyond redemption though, because the character of Blake, played by Alexandra Daddario, is great. She goes beyond the typical damsel-in-distress stereotype and is actually very capable and strong in her journey through a rapidly collapsing San Francisco. Her character and Daddario's portrayal make up 3 of the 4 points I'm giving this movie.

The earthquakes are overmuch done, no earthquake of intensity 7.6 would bring waves as such shown in the movie. The whole movie is based on Dwayne and his family, who fights all odds to overcome the disaster. The main theme is how a mega-quake generates at the San-Andreas fault and ends up dismantling LA to San Francisco. Could be frightening and disturbing for some people who are not a frequent viewer of this kind of movie featuring mass destruction and human deaths.

San Andreas is one in a very long line of PG-rated films dating back to the mid-nineties that engulf American coastal cities with CGI.Thousands die (including a WTF cameo from Kylie Minogue) but you'd never know it, the insensitivity and cowardice of the PG rating meaning the film can happily exploit 9/11 imagery without it really feeling like anyone got hurt. In this day and age, this feels borderline insensitive. More so, the script feels the need to turn it up to 9.6 on the Richter scale of stupidity and then take itself seriously, no better represented here as Paul Giamatti doing his most serious seriousness that it vaults into true camp. Contrivance is heaped on contrivance to contrived effect, and suspension of disbelief is suspended to suspenseless effect. Occasionally between all the shifting CGI plates, the film quietens down and here it actually becomes moderately engaging, before it asks the cast to gaze at a CGI American flag unfurling against a CGI magic hour and crass reassurances that everything is fine, but it hasn't earned the right to reassure us because it isn't any good.The sound crew do sterling work, and little Art Pilkington from The Impossible show the rest of the cast how to be genuinely charming and funny, the one survivor (okay, Carla Gugino is lovely and warm as always) of this digital disaster foisted on an unexpected audience, the true victims of this tale.",San Andreas
493,jimbell-07164,I was rooting for the buildings to 'win' !!,4,14 June 2020,"The usual OTT acting, combined with the predictable storyline and usual ridiculous 'managed-to-get-out-of-the-way-at-the-last-second-to-escape-from-peril' scenarios all help to spoil some actually quite gripping special effects. The man who can fly and drive anything, plus his wife who can emerge almost unscathed from any situation, as well as the daughter and friends that managed to select the only building that wasn't on fire and didn't collapse, make for truly unbelievable watching. Add in to that crystal clear water with no bodies floating in it and not much debris either, and the final package is just annoyingly far removed from what would be the reality. SPOILER ALERT: I thought a bit of reality was going to set in when the daughter got trapped, but no, she survived too. Just skip through this film to enjoy the special effects, but don't waste any time watching the rest of it. It gets 4 stars for special effects (probably out of 4) and zero for the rest, hance 4/10 overall. Pants!",San Andreas

The devastation in this movie was only surpassed by my loss of brain cells for watching this unbelievably horrible frill-ride through Dumbsville.It was quite obvious that there was no money left after CGI to pay for a screenwriter, or actors. I actually think this movie would be better if you could turn the dialogue off and just watch the destruction and the sound of explosions. You certainly wouldn't miss anything important.How does this possibly rate higher than Earthquake! 1974, which looks like an Academy award winner next to this?It barely made 2 stars in my book and only because I know there are worse movies out there.If you'd rather watch paint dry, raise your hand.",San Andreas

497,gansvv,"Thrilling, good graphics, clean story, enjoyable show",10,28 May 2015,"Another good movie from the Rock. Its a gripping tale involving the San Andreas earthquake, with good graphics and an engaging storyline from start to finish. Hardly predictable IMO, the movie itself is well thought out and well made, the CGI is pretty good and realistic (people shrieked out in excitement from various parts of the theater at various times!), and Dwayne Johnson brings an exciting vibe to the whole show. Overall, it makes for an enjoyable evening out. A must watch at the theaters this Summer!The film fully captures the terrifying power and fearsome wrath of a massive widespread earthquake. It also becomes quite entertaining to watch with the family getting their act together to survive the effects of the quake. Director Brad Peyton was able to strike that perfect balance to keep us at the edge of our seats with the sense of imminent (and potentially real) danger, and still have an exhilarating fun time. The music is also quite catchy and entertaining. And yes, you'll also pick up some quake survival tips along the way!",San Andreas

The the chopper comes down maneuvering between the cliffs unrealistically, then comes some bad Hollywood lines and bad acting.. I watched this rescue scene suffering.Then the doc in the class scene with another Hollywoodic lines... that was the moment when I stopped watching.Its probably a good movie for 6 - 12 years old kids, not for those who's looking for more ""serious"" stuff.*Rating comment: I thought about giving it 3 because I barely watched the first 10 minutes, but that was really, really bad start, and even if the movie is much better at the end, it is just too awful.1 STAR for me",San Andreas

As per usual, most of the action scenes always end with you just laughing at the obscenity of them. Saying that, you just have to look past the fact that it's a film that sets out to entertain with the biggest and best special effects money can buy. If you take these films too seriously then don't bother watching them.As mentioned, the special effects really are astonishing, and the best word to describe the disaster scenes would be colossal. From that point of view, its worth a watch.The script is OK , the acting is fine (nothing spectacular, but what are you expecting?), however the overall story does have more holes than a gold course.I watched this film looking for action and entertainment, and thats what I got.

It is really f**n entertaining and I love'd every second of the ride.Also the 3D is created well – even though stereoscopic effect is generated afterwards in digital post-production.There are dozens of stupid and illogical takes and sequences that makes you face palm yourself, but the fact is, that San Andreas is just awesome disaster movie.",San Andreas

508,smitha10,Best disaster movie since The Day After Tomorrow!,10,29 May 2015,"***MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS (depending on what you class as a spoiler)***OK, so we all know that Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson can do action movies, and he sure does his fair share of that in this film, but we also get to see him in a bit of a dramatic role as well, and I must say... Bravo.This film is definitely action packed, and riddled with massive destruction. I loved every minute of it, and if you liked The Day After Tomorrow, you will too! Now, I've read a few of the other reviews on this website, and have to say, I think some people just have a bee in their bonnet about some things. I think the cast is brilliant (even though we only get to see Colton Haynes briefly at the beginning), and the film also does a very good job of showing people the kind of destruction and devastation that may be possible, when this event decides to happen! Some people have said that the story line is predictable, and that there are some plot holes. Personally, I think that yes, some parts where easy to see coming, but that doesn't stop you from getting totally immersed in the theatrics of the film, and having an amazing cinema experience! All in all, this movie deserves all the praise it gets, and I think it is an honourable salute to anyone and everyone involved in rescue, and disaster relief. The entertainment provided, does not shroud the seriousness also supplied, and I lost track of how many times I said ""Oh my God!"" during this amazing cinematic spectacle!",San Andreas
509,bjb1100,boom boom no story,6,29 May 2015,San Andreas was all destruction and no story. Lets start of with the effects. Most of the time the CGI was brilliant it was very entertaining watching buildings collapse. There were some parts of the film when the CGI looked very poor. For example when all of the boats were speeding up the tsunami some of the boats looked very fake and looked like they had been badly animated. I must say most disaster movies are like this especially that film 2012. The acting in San Andreas was up to scratch. The film altogether was very predictable. I must admit San Andreas was a very entertaining film with some very good effects. 4 out of 10,San Andreas
510,tjyu1992,"It was good but not great, it was unique but not new.",6,1 January 2016,"I base my reviews on whether or not I re-watch the movie or certain scenes of it. I did actually re-watch certain scenes, because as far as special effects goes this is a great example.Now why do I only give it a 6?Firstly, the plot wherein the father-daughter relationship is strong but the husband-wife relationship has already withered and died because *Gasp* the wife fell in love with someone else. Like that's never happened before (Taken movie, but to reference a disaster movie 2012 also had the father-children relationship and the mother already living with someone else)Secondly, Dwayne Johnson and Ioan Gruffudd is a extreme contrast of one another. Dwayne would probably represent the US with his muscular form and heroics, while Ioan represents a sophisticated form through his European decent. At least in 2012 the new husband wasn't all that different in contrast to the old. Also the new husband died somewhat heroically, in this movie Ioan Gruffudd just dies.Thirdly,the Earthquake scenes were good and the tsunami scene was intense, I nearly cried when the older couple walking away from the disaster of the Earthquake, surrendered to the tsunami by embracing each other in their arms. I can't imagine how they could have died and that was just tear-jerking.Ultimately, while the visual effects were stunning to say the least. The story and plot line was too obvious. Adoptive father tries to act honorably but ultimately flees for his own life and dies as punishment. They really broke down Ioan Gruffudd's character by shifting him from caring step-father to every man for himself, especially when he shoved people aside to survive. The husband-wife falling in love near the end and the family reunited by tragedy was also a bit of a cliché at this point.",San Andreas
511,stabester0406,So wrong....yet enjoyable!,7,27 August 2015,"Well, what can you say about this film, the Rock is...well the Rock.Even though as you progress through the movie you sit there and think this is corny, cheesy whatever you want to describe it as it is strangely compelling, the effects are quite good and the supporting cast are all passable, Paul Giamatti being reliably good as always and Carla Gugino is at last getting a fair crack of the whip.The Rock plays Ray who is obviously a super helicopter pilot who has carried out hundreds of rescue missions as part of the US Army and is now carrying out super rescues in the good old USA, when major earthquakes hit along the San Andreas fault line it is up to Ray to save both his estranged wife and Daughter who is in San Francisco with a weaselly Ioan Gruffudd who is Ray's ex's new squeeze who I feel is sadly wasted in this.There are 2 lines in the film whereby you physically cringe and wish that the Director had either made the Rock change his lines and cut the unfurling of the American Flag from the film before he delivers the second of the 2 awful lines of dialogue.OK the script is predictable, the story line well trodden but overall it was enjoyable without being overly great or overly dire (apart from the 2 instances).Take out your brain and sit and watch for what it is, popcorn fodder for the masses.",San Andreas
512,SophieSlut,"Has it's fun moments, but mostly fails at being a disaster movie.",3,2 June 2015,"First off, let me say how surprising it is that this is the first real disaster film in almost 6 years. After the film ""2012"", Box Office Mojo only lists movies like ""Contagion"", ""The Grey"" and ""Gravity"" which can hardly be considered disaster movies, movies like ""Noah"" and ""Godzilla"" which contain fantasy elements, and films that are too low budget and low gross to be given major attention by anyone. So basically, San Andreas is the first major pure disaster film since mother of all disaster movies ""2012"" which came out in 2009 (I know, confusing right?). 2012 may not be a good film, but is undeniably the most well known disaster modern disaster movie, and probably the most popular of all time. So please understand where people are coming from when they inevitably compare San Andreas to 2012. Especially if those people are too young to be familiar with the disaster movies of the 80's and 90's.But on second thought, it isn't really that surprising we haven't had a disaster movie in so long. Not only did 2012 just seem un-top able as far as pure mayhem and destruction are concerned, the main appeal of disaster movies is that we get to see cities and buildings destroyed while our powerless protagonists run about trying to survive the brutal forces of nature. But we pretty much get all that in Transformers, in Godzilla, even in Man of Steel and Avengers. Disaster movies are basically Transformers movies but without any Transformers. So it's understandable that with special effects and CGI becoming more convincing and less expensive, that we are going to get fewer and fewer straight disaster movies. But it's nice sometimes to look back and enjoy an older and mostly abandoned sub genre.With that in mind, let's proceed with the actual review. The biggest problem I have with San Andreas, is that it doesn't even really up the ante with the destruction porn. There's nothing ground breaking in it special effects wise. It's actually quite underwhelming. At the end of the movie I thought to my self ""When is the big earthquake coming?As for the characters, it's your typical disaster movie lineup. It's a lack of characterization at all. Which is troubling because in a movie where the point is showing your main characters in life threatening peril, it seems like it would be imperative for us to care about them a bit.Almost none of the dialogue was even the least bit clever. I found myself saying the dialogue before the characters many times throughout the film. It was a huge waste of Dwayne Johnson, who will nail a performance no matter what dialogue you give him. It seems as if he only adds something to a movie if he is actually given a character to work with. Who knew?Aspects even seem stitched together from a slough of other disaster movies. The nearly divorced couple from Twister. The douche new husband from Twister and 2012. The estranged father-daughter relationship from 2012. The giant ocean liner crashing into the coast scene from 2012. The ground swelling special effect from... 2012. The child and parent trapped in rising water and across from a transparent wall scene from..... 2012. And the car rolling down the hill in the first scene looked like it was animated by Robot Chicken.Believe it or not, the San Andreas fault was not the largest crevasse featured in this film. It probably wasn't even in the top 5. The casting director seemed to have made sure that all female cast characters, both major or minor had supple breast-age which was displayed prominently throughout the film. I'm not a prude, so I count this as neither a plus nor a minus for the film. I just found the choice to be rather odd for a disaster film.I was rather surprised that I saw neither Roland Emerich or Michael Bay's name at the end of this film.That being said, it did have a few good scenes, and it wasn't a complete failure. There were a few scenes of destruction where I said to my self ""Oh wow. That's actually really cool"". Without giving anything away, there were two suspenseful scenes in this movie, and both involved a persons limb being pinned under an automobile. The foreshadowing in the very very first scene is actually quite clever and funny.All-in-all, it's nowhere near the worst thing in the world, but after 6 years of waiting, it's literally nothing new.3/10 or 1.5/5",San Andreas

It is like 2012, but with San Andreas and more reasonable and real. I think it was a great watch 4.5/5. The casting is amazing, I was surprised. Alexandra and her blue eyes are captivating as usual. Rock and Carla were a great pair. I definitely recommend watching it in IMAX or 3-D for a more full and live feeling view. Events are portrayed point on more than the majority of the movie. It is crazy to imagine this even being reasonably close to happening. If an Earthquake ever hit bad enough near the fault line, there is a great chance that it would cause the fault to move causing a major earthquake and mass destruction to California.",San Andreas

516,msias-73442,Money's Worth,10,30 May 2015,"Instead of ripping into character depth and story line, the overall point this movie delivered is an hour and 47 min of action packed thrill in 3D. It is not often your able to go to a movie theater, pay for overpriced tickets, popcorn, and dirty theaters and get completely absorbed into a movie and walk out feeling like that was worth my money and time. As for the common denominator for these kind of movies, at least the daughter no longer needs pull ups after the world was destroyed. Keep in mind, the length of this movie also keeps the momentum of action, where as the director did not fill the void by insulting the audiences intelligence.",San Andreas
517,niallwade,A great re-skin of older films,6,31 May 2015,"We have seen it all before in the events that take place in 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow. Though I believe that Brad Peyton has created something special, something that carries the film more than other typical disaster films.To be honest I am not a fan of Dwaine Johnson he is a tad OTT sometimes. In San Andreas he plays a character by the name of Ray, an ex military man that has over six hundred confirmed rescues. He is a real family man and it is good to see a man who holds such barring get emotional certain points in the story. This is if not a very small spoiler, however, Ray and his wife Emma lost a daughter to a rafting incident which resulted in her death. Personally I love the fact that Ray is a rescuer with so many successful missions, though with all of his success and confidence, he cannot protect those he loves and it is such a massive part to his character. Overall I think the acting was solid in the film. From all actors, they give a great performance and really get in touch with their characters. Although there a few flaws (Narrative wise) to some characters. For example one character that played a big role in the start of the film, seemed to disappear for three quarters of the film and then appear again for a few seconds just to give us audience a little bit of closure. The flaw here is that his story feels rushed. As I said he played a massive part in the film and it seems that the directer just forgot about him, remembered him and rushed to finish his perception of the events off.Blake (Ray and Emma's Daughter) has her own story to these events. Blake meets two brothers called Ben and Ollie. They all keep together to help each other out and survive and it results in some really tense moments, however, in my opinion Ollie at times is just an awkward character. Sure people can say that he is just being the annoying little brother at times, though I think that at times, his comments can be rather superfluous and tedious to absorb.In terms of post production I think the film was fantastic. San Andreas is very nicely paced, fast cuts when action is being dished out and the tempo is slowed when much needed character development is given to us. On the other hand, the sound compositions sound more like a super hero film rather than a disaster film. Don't get me wrong, it was great music, though I feel that sometimes the music is out of context.I would recommend anybody to see San Andreas. It hits you right in the feels and supplies the adrenaline at tense, thrilling scenes. I feel that it appeals to most audiences to be honest . It has something for everybody to relate to. That being family to just action. Give San Andreas a shot, I am sure that you will enjoy it. It has flaws, though many films do.",San Andreas
518,albrantjes,Great for its graphics...but that's it,5,3 June 2015,"Spent date night seeing this, was exactly what was expected. Graphics and the 3D were both insane, and to see it on the big screen was worth it. Too bad the plot was highly predictable (if you have seen any disaster pic, you know exactly what will unfold)The character development was next to nil, and left you feeling apathetic about anyone involved, but no worse than a whole bunch of movies so was bearable and although the action is what makes the movie, there are parts just too outlandish even for a movie like this.I was surprised however that there was no screaming child-bless!- And no one pulled the cliché hero sacrifice to save a life so wasn't all terrible! (that doesn't apply to the cheesy line of 'we will rebuild' whilst the American Flag unfurls in the wind)Is really just a remake of 'earthquake' from the 70s, and not as great in comparison to the Korean remake of 'towering inferno' (the tower) but Still a decent, 0 thought process disaster flick.",San Andreas

This one offers up some great special effects that compensate for some of the story's sillier moments.Say what you will, the movie is critic-proof, and even the most cynical will have to admit it delivers what you bought your ticket to see.Given the texture of the special effects and the scope of the aerial shots one would not be wrong in thinking Roland Emmerich was at the helm of this latest, big disaster flick. Emmerich, who has directed the likes of Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow and 2012, has somewhat monopolized the genre as of late, but San Andreas isn't the unrelated sequel to Has a massive heart and makes the right choices at the right moments, and manages to skilfully avoid the many inherent pitfalls with this sort of material",San Andreas

Don't bother with 3D, though. It's just as good in 2D.The film is around 2 hours long and my two boys and I were gripped through the whole film. The helicopter scene at the start was well done.

The Rock is great as per usual, maybe not the best actor in the  world but a joy to watch none the less. The only issue I had with the  movie was when he revived his daughter the movie felt like it wasn't  meant to end there, it just gave the feeling of being cut short, the  moment she was revived and there was a little emotional punch the  earthquakes suddenly stopped and everything was happily ever after.  Apart from that it is a very immersive movie but that part just killed  it for me, it definitely has some re-watchability. I would  recommend watching this as most people don't see the ending as an  issue, I just picked up on it!",San Andreas

Cast justified itself uniquely.

This movie is almost ""running"" with action scenes - you can not breathe a second, there is already coming the next catastrophe. And apart from that, Dwayne Johnson is playing his role quite sensitive and comprehensible. I could go with his situation and feelings. Of course, there are some strange fortunes and unrealistic happenings, but as far as I can say, this is pretty normal for a Disaster-Movie.In summary I can say: this movie is really outstanding for this kind of genre.",San Andreas

But this one was just special. I mean..... All the main characters look like they are Barbie dolls! Men and Women! I realize they are in California, but jeez! I couldn't stop staring at their TEETH!!!! BIG, WHITE, FAKE TEETH! They seemed to want to come out and smack me! Then there is the vulnerable, innocent, fake chested daughter. How can I really feel like she is trouble? We just keep staring at her abnormally large chest! I kept thinking in the drowning scene how that chest should take her straight to the top! I mean, she IS cute... I give you that... but horribly casted for a vulnerable, in trouble, college student who is being rescued by mommy and daddy. The ex wife is just about useless and my opinion of her was ALREADY set when she was moving in with boyfriend before the divorce papers were even GIVEN to her husband!!!! REALLY???? WHAT A SLEEZE! If she was ready to move on.... she should've had the courtesy of at least SERVING her husband before seriously dating! But maybe my morals are just higher.... And then there were the lines..... that Dwayne seemed to pose to while giving them... As if there was a paparazzi just around the corner to catch his witty remark and post it to social media stating how clever he was.... ick....all together.... great action... horrible casting...horrible dialogue.",San Andreas

But the first scene wasn't related to that at all.The film started getting really intense when the first earthquakes happened ( this was when the two characters were scouting for the earthquake readings ) , a earthquake occurred killing a character and many civilians and this pretty much repeated through the whole movie , earthquakes occurring and buildings clashing etc ( of not killing any main characters )I would definitely watch this film if you haven't already!

528,christopherjattwood,An educational disaster movie,10,29 February 2016,"San Andreas is an educational film and not an entertainment in the cinematic sense. There is no entertainment in watching large numbers of people getting squished by falling buildings or drowned by an enormous tsunami. There are two central characters. The action man is Fire and Rescue helicopter pilot Dwayne Johnson. The brainy character is Paul Giamatti's college Professor. Dwayne Johnson's character Raymond Gaines gets to fly a helicopter, a light aircraft, a powerboat and a road vehicle. Paul Giamatti's character Dr Lawrence Hayes is the scientist who, along with Dr Kim Park, gets to find out how to predict an earthquake in advance so that he can warn people to try and get out of harm's way in time. Although the West Coast gets flattened by the biggest earthquake in history the film itself ends on a positive note with a large Stars and Stripes flag being unfurled from what is left of Golden Gate Bridge.",San Andreas
529,jmatthew2010,A Faulty Disaster- Minor Spoilers,5,1 July 2016,"San Andreas is like that magazine you keep on your toilet for bathroom reading; you've read it repeatedly to the point to where you've memorized the contents, but no matter how many times you've read it you keep it around for its purpose to passively entertain you while you evacuate your bowels. This is what San Andreas is: Passive entertainmentits plot is recycled and predictable and contrived, but it provides just enough unoriginal, but flashy, entertainment to keep its audience interested. In other words, this will be the movie you will begrudgingly watch on cable, when there is absolutely nothing else on to watch.Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson portrays Ray, a tireless rescue helicopter pilot and recent divorcée. After the Hoover Dam is destroyed by an earthquake, he's forced to renege on a weekend trip with his daughter, Blake, who in turn decides to accompany her newly minted architect step-father, Daniel Riddick, to his place of employment located in San Francisco. While there Blake meets two affable British brothers, Ben and Ollie, and of course, a romantic subplot is appropriately initiated between Blake and Ben before the world goes to hell, fire and brimstone. Meanwhile, mother and ex- wife Emma is having lunch with Daniel's sister portrayed snobbishly by Kylie Minogue; Lunch is cut short when the San Andreas fault ruptures sending a powerful earthquake through Los Angeles sending Miss Minogue and other characters we're not meant to care about falling to their deaths while Emma aimlessly runs around scratch- free with all hell breaking loose around her impassively screaming, ""Oh my God!"" like some panicked modern-day valley girl who can't access a WiFi network on her iPhone. Once the earthquake hits San Francisco, Blake is abandoned by her cowardly stepfather only to be heroically rescued by Britain's finest, Ben and Ollie, who use a rusty, old carjack to free Blake from the grisly death of being flattened like an IHOP pancake. Upon seeing the destruction transpiring below through the window of his helicopter, The Rock cocks the People's Eyebrow and turns the helicopter around to save the day.Oh yeah, I forgotPaul Giamatti plays this really smart guy who teaches at CalTech University that is attempting to figure out how to predict earthquakes before they occur. He serves the purpose of informing the general population of California how screwed they are and mostly hides under tables screaming at others to do the same because obviously that is the safest thing to do when an earthquake of 9.5 magnitude befalls the local landscape.Shortly after turning his helicopter around, Ray randomly finds Emma standing atop a mountain of rubble which used to be the Sky-rise restaurant where she was dining with Kylie Minogue. From here, the disaster caused by the split of the San Andreas Fault plays second fiddle to an overly predictable, substandard search and rescue story. The concerned mother, Emma, cries, ""What about our daughter!? What about Blake!?"" and Ray stoically replies, ""We'll find her."" This embodies about 85% of the stock dialogue between these characters during the search and rescue mission for their daughter which represents the second half of the film. During their quest, they crash a helicopter, they're held up by gun wielding looters, almost drive off into the San Andreas split, sky-dive from an airplane and jump a tsunami in a motor-boat with barely a bruise or scratch to show. They go through hell, and we as the audience are supposed to care. What I found exasperating was the general lack of awareness towards the countless numbers of others who lost their lives during the same disastrous events that our protagonists experience. Sure, we're shown a few, quick shots of frightened civilians running for their lives and wide-eyed aghast facial expressions before the forceful impact of a surging tsunami or collapsing skyscraper, but it isn't enough to profoundly affect even the most empathetic of movie viewers. You dismiss these unfortunate souls with submissive indifference, place your focus on the upper middle class family whose sole concern is locating their daughter and blindly accept the contrivances associated with achieving that mission's objective.This film is laughably bad and in that respect, I'll give it some credibility. There were moments in San Andreas in which I facetiously chuckled when I most likely was supposed to wiping a poignant tear from my eye. There is a scene in this film towards the end when one of our main characters is presumed ""dead"" which is meant to be one of those ""edge of your seat"" emotional, tear-jerking moments where you already know the character is going to outlandishly pop back to life, say ""I'm OK!"" and the main characters wipe the nervous sweat from their brow replying, ""Boy, that sure was close"", while ignoring the plight of millions of others who lost their lives and loved ones. Anyways, there is a line delivered during this moment in the film which is delivered so terribly that it put me in state of noticeable uncontrollable laughter. A middle aged couple sitting nearby quietly and sternly admonished me with a, ""That's not funny!"" I tried to hold it together for them, but once that character popped back to life, I was back to laughing like a sadistic misanthrope who just witnessed somebody trip and fall over a pothole. There other moments in this film that will also result in a giddy giggle or an irritated grimace due to its reliance on absurdity which wholly serves as the only main motive for seeing San Andreas.There is nothing original about this film as it is basically a recycled version of other disaster-related films, except this time, we have earthquakes representing the catalyst for mass-scale devastation instead of volcanoes, asteroids the size of Texas, global warming, etc. Overall, San Andreas is a ""faulty"" disaster of a film.",San Andreas
530,lachlan-58427,"""It Knows What it Wants to Be And Does It Spectacularly""",8,26 April 2016,"San Andreas. To describe the movie in two words, 'friggin amazing.' I love this movie, everything about it just excites me. The characters are great, the action is great, the plot line is simple but great. It's a movie that knows what it is and makes a solid attempt being that type of movie. You must enter the movie with a mind set that says 'this is going to be over the top, fun and stupid.' If you want a film that is Oscar worthy, or is an action movie like Mad Max: Fury Road, you're watching the wrong movie. The film deprives itself of giving the audience one hell of a ride as the city of San Andreas is hit by a major earthquake. The Special FX are amazing and keep you at the edge of your seat watching all the destruction that is destroying every single object within the city. It's thrilling. I honestly have never been so excited watching a movie before. I just didn't want the film to end. I mean, the movie isn't a 'great' movie because it has a very basic plot line, has one dimensional characters that are never fully developed throughout the film, and the interactions between each character is often limited and generic. But aside from all this I loved this movie. It is so satisfying to watch, everything you want to happen does and it never leaves you disappointed.San Andreas is a must see movie for anyone who enjoys watching large scale disaster movies that are made at a high budget with thrilling action scenes and a simple while satisfying story.",San Andreas

This movie tells the story of a family surviving catastrophic events. A rescue mission for a pilot despite all the difficulties. The acting in this movie is excellent. I was scared and excited because it was believable which is an important quality in a movie if not it is the determining factor! Although the facts of the movie may be way off, they film makers made me believe this could actually happen. I felt they succeeded in what movies should be. They sparked my imagination. I give this movie a thumbs up if you want to watch an exciting thriller. If you are a fan of The Day After Tomorrow, which I am, then this movie may be up your alley.

Other than those few moments though the rest of it is just okay. The acting is okay. The effects are okay. The music is okay. The sound design is okay. Most of it is just okay. The only thing that prevented me from giving it a 6 out of 10 is the script is stupid garbage. I can't explain why because I will only give spoilers to movies that are over 10 years old but believe me the script is garbage. In fact it is such garbage that I almost have it a 4 but I didn't because of how hot Alexandra Daddario is. Would I recommend it? Umm.....if you want to see a dumb destruction movie... sure.

539,pradanachandra,Review of this film,10,13 May 2019,"San andreas is an action, drama, thriller film directed by Brad Peyton and stars Dwayne Johnson, Carla Gugino, Alexandra Daddario, Ioan Gruffudd, Paul Giamatti. The film tells of a rescue helicopter pilot who must try to save his daughter during an earthquake and tsunami raged in California. San Andreas is the name of a fracture or cracking ground in California, United States which has a length of 1200 km that separates the Pacific plate and the North American plate. This resulted in an earthquake that occurred on April 18, 1906 at 5.12 am in San Francisco. Some 28,000 buildings were destroyed and 3000 people died in this incident.My first impression was before watching the San Andreas film, I thought maybe a film like a film about natural disasters that had often been played and the types of disasters needed were also used in previous films, for example a 2012 film that visualized disasters and collapsed buildings saw the kind of disaster which everyone would love the type of disaster classified as often displayed in previous disaster films, more than the 2012 film showing all kinds of chaos from the type of disaster that only collapsed buildings, earthquakes that split the ground, large tsunamis, and up to the eruption of the mountain very awesome.However, after I watched this film, even though the film was still themed earthquake, the earthquake visualization presented here was very detailed in the results. Starting from additional animations such as the tsunami disaster that involved, the sound effects were very mesmerizing and able to enchant the audience to always be complicated in every scene, really like listening to a large collapsed building in the middle of the city, all of which looked challenging, looking for a very good every place even though some of the place settings are forced or not suitable. But all of that can be played, the acting of the players who can be said to be very capable in covering the story of Ray's family drama, Dwayne here appears not like in the previous films, not just moving the biceps like the fight.Behind the advantages of this film, there are some things that I think are lacking in this film. For example about a shelter under a compilation table an earthquake occurs. Taking refuge in that way is an old way that has been rectified and carried out to do. Likewise, saving yourself to the roof of the building, isn't going down and out of the building. In addition there are some place settings that I think are too many that cause it don't match what is done.From the film we can take a moral message that is, don't always think negatively about our spouse even though he has had a big mistake, maybe all of these things have been arranged by the creator of the universe and it is not easy to give up because something will not lie to our hard work . In addition, many other moral messages are implied. In my opinion, this film is highly recommended for watching with family.",San Andreas

542,eamonwilliams-07000,San Andreas Review for class,10,10 February 2020,"I watched San Andreas for my class on natural hazards and disasters. I payed special attention for disaster movie stereotypes and information, then decided if this would be realistic or not based off what I have learned so far in my class.
San Andreas is an epic tale of The Rock (Ray Gaines) saving his family during the largest earthquakes ever recorded in history. Being aptly prepared for his task through his time in the marines as well as being the LAFD search and rescue helicopter pilot, he manages incredibly dangerous natural hazards. Not only does the Rock (Ray) rescue his ex-wife from a collapsing skyscraper due to an earthquake but performs incredible feats such as safely landing a crashing helicopter, rides a tsunami wave like a surfer, and saves his daughter in fantastic fashion. Some of my favorite scenes include when The Rock pilots his rescue helicopter, such as in the opening scene. I also enjoyed the skydiving scene, as The rock was very non-chalant about the whole ordeal.
Some of the scenes that I found to have interesting ""believability"" factor would be the Hoover Dam earthquake scene, the whole Caltech storyline, and the tsunami scene in San Francisco. In the Hoover Dam scene, I enjoyed the instance where before the dam breaks, you can see an emergency release of water. I believe this might happen as the dam seeks to maintain an appropriate pressure. However, this believability dissipates quickly as the main scientist stands literally feet away from the broken dam as literal tons of water woosh past him. I think the whole Caltech storyline was a bit hokey, as they found a foolproof way to predict earthquakes through aa precursor magnetic fault. This is just blatantly not true but makes sense insofar as the main plotline. I also think the tsunami scene in san Francisco is hilariously over exaggerated. I was laughing super hard when The Rock rode the tsunami wave like a surfer in his boat. Many of the action scenes I feel are made to be more fun to watch rather than scientifically accurate.
If the world's largest earthquake had hit California, I do not doubt the massive destruction it would cause, and the temporary collapse of society on the west coast would certainly occur. However, I do not think that we would be able to predict and notify the public like they do in this movie. It would be a tragic event that the world would remember. However, I feel that maybe the earth would not split open like in the movie, nor there be mountain tall tsunami waves. One thing I think the movie did a good job depicting however is the role of heroes. I believe people will step up in times of crisis just like The Rock did. If I had one takeaway from this movie, it's the importance of being a first responder and taking action.",San Andreas

You're not supposed to take these films too seriously, you're just intended to go along with the ride of destruction--and what a ride it is! This movie has some excellent destruction scenes; although they aren't exactly realistic and don't always make sense, they're a lot of fun to watch, and that's the whole point.Sure, if you compare this with all other films, it's not great; but in the disaster movie genre, with other such films as 2012, the Day After Tomorrow, and Greenland, it's actually pretty decent.

It's not about the acting which is more than convincing but it's about the totality of the disaster and the miraculous survival of a hand full of people, led by Dwayne Johnson in a very convincing role as a dad trying to save his daughter from a disastrous earthquake and a humongous tsunami in San Francisco. The special effects were so realistic they were unbelievable. My wife and I were literally transfixed watching this movie.

It shifts and slides down three different times for dramatic effect... Stupid. Why would the LAFD take a reporter and her camera man on a dangerous rescue mission??? Stupid.

557,SeanV1390,Lacklustre at its best,3,7 June 2015,"Contrary to all the good reviews I have seen so far that led me to take a chance on this movie mine is not one of them. (I think) I saw SA for what it was, no expectations whatsoever beside the little excitement I had from seeing a lot of positive opinions right here for it..It's as the title says packs nothing in but meaningless action done on the computer. I kept an eye on the details to see what is real vs fake, and kudos must be given to the actors for their effort in bringing some realism to the plot. Realism shouldn't be an issue when you walk in to see a movie of this kind but I just mention it to praise one aspect of the movie, which is acting. While you can't probably expect anything better these days as far as performances go with big productions and in the same genre the cast in SA and their acting were of the good sort. I didn't think they had much to work with in the first place and with the movie being 70 percent or more deep in graphics it's quite an achievement how they pulled it off here in this setting. Thin line of story stretching for almost hours on end while the mother nature being the force that characters must reckon with but in a complete detached way. A handful of characters in the plot drive the well familiar story forward even if they're predictable the pace and the events as it happens makes it less obvious and more to the point, that is SA and the biggest earthquake that ever is to see. That being said I wasn't particularly wowed by the impressive cgi display of disaster scenes. Simply because I felt I'd seen it all before, though it is still too easy to admit there's been lot of effort put into and those scenes are quite impressive on their own. But for me it wasn't enough. If that's what you want to see then you will not be let down. I was disappointed only to see the shift in power from real human drama to the idea more of let's make things blow up take up so much of this movie's cause for its existence and average moviegoers, me on this occasion, being forced to spend 2 hours on this to find out for ourselves. There's one final say, it's a perfect movie for those who want nothing but action interspersed with some drama then you please go and see. Though like one person said before me, go with an open mind, and (I think) I did, but it did not help me walking out at 3/4 into the movie. Fortunately! there's hope, which is why there's an attractive young women strategically placed in the story to help cool your nerves if things a little too clichéd and you're on the edge of your seat ready to leave, it just didn't do it for me :(",San Andreas

The acting, screen writing, drama, special effects, and sheer magnitude and scale of this utterly fantastic movie will leave you glued to the screen with a thrill that other movies just can't do.Moreover, this movie is actually based on fact, and is not merely hypothetical, but truly can and will happen. Like he said in the movie, it's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when (don't worry, this is not a spoiler). This will touch home to my fellow Californians.I highly recommend this movie, you will not regret it!",San Andreas
559,pedrotheshadow,A fair The Day After Tomorrow 2.0,7,11 November 2015,"The story of San Andreas reports the events of a rescue-chopper pilot and his in the aftermath of a massive earthquake in California.Dwayne Johnson portrays Ray, the rescue-chopper pilot in a journey to save his wife and daughter from the debris of an earthquake. His journey through California state by any means necessary without too much care for what happens around him is neglecting from a rescue- oriented person but, perhaps true to the human nature and, especially, if considering his bitter past. In general, he is the ""let's do it"" muscle guy with one aim: save the family.Carla Gugino portrays Emma, the mother in the family. Married to Daniel Riddick (Ioan Gruffudd), she starts as a helpless woman in the top of ruined building and finish as ""Lara Croft"" breaking through the most difficult challenges to save her daughter.Alexandra Daddario portrays Blake, the daughter that leaves her parents' wings and finds herself in trouble. She shows more courage than her mom and fiercely leads the newly met brothers Ben (Hugo Jognstone-Burt) and Ollie (Art Parkinson) to the only place in town where they would be safe.Ioan Gruffuld portrays a middle-age ""Ted Mosby"" that became rich and unscrupulous and only cares for himself.Hugo Johnstone-Burt and Art Parkinson play the two British brothers that would just die if it wasn't for Blake.In general, it's another ""The Day After Tomorrow"" catastrophic movie type where only the main characters seem to survive. All roles are well played, in my point of view. I'm very happy with this non- blockbuster movie.",San Andreas
560,barry-154,Simply fun and very well acted.,10,1 June 2015,"My name is Barry Ratcliffe, I judge a movie different than most. I have been a full time actor for 17 years, so I am usually way to critical, so I will make no exception for this film. It is great! That's it, no pompous description of plot lines, archs, or blah, blah! Dwayne does an amazing job acting in this film, that's right, Dwayne Johnson does an AMAZING job action. I don't know why this surprises people. Al Snow is my best friend and he is an excellent actor. Being around the wrestling industry, I am amazed that people don't realize that most of these wrestlers are very smart and have been doing live theater for 20 years plus, that translates very well to acting. And this film had me on the edge of my seat and that never happens with me, I am usually noticing the 400 people in the room putting the film together. But because this movie used great actors, a great story, great effects, audio, and editing, it is simply seamless, and simply a FUN movie!!!!",San Andreas
561,snablor,Cringeworthy,2,27 August 2015,"This movie is amazing, if you disregard dialogue, script and acting. I guess the only thing left to like is the effects, and those are great.In a way it's kind of charming to see a throwback to the patriotic disaster movies of the 90s, but it doesn't feel like it's genuine nods and winks. I also don't know the backstory behind the film project, but I sensed religious overtones. Could be my imagination.They wanted strong female leads, and that's commendable. But it was so obvious that it took me out of the film. I wanted to scream ""I GET IT!""Cut out everything between the action scenes you have a 30 min long 5/10 movie.",San Andreas
562,ru_nps,Solid and yet disappointing,2,1 December 2015,"Whole thing is a solid 6.5 movie with effects to be astonished and characters to like. Yet, the only thing that disappointed me was revival of Blake, young female protagonist, which seems to be the target audience. She was dead, I felt the loss, I was afraid of it, and was afraid of revival. It just made me repulsed of Hollywood scripts. Even after million deaths say ""we'll rebuild"" and leave mourning to other characters. Blind optimism of that ending doesn't let me feel connected to anybody depicted. It makes me hard to trust a film. It makes me feel betrayed. It makes finding a film to enjoy deeply even harder.I agree with objective average number, but find it hard to ignore the trope I got sick of.",San Andreas

Given the cast I expected a rehash of previous incarnations of this genre and I wasn't disappointed and found the 2 hour ride a lot of fun. My personal taste in movies goes from Eraserhead via the Coen Bros to popcorn fun like San Andreas and anyone choosing to watch this film expecting a profound script and Oscar winning performances seriously needs medical help. The negative tripe written in many of the reviews here simply point to frustrated, wannabe film critics or people who stepped into the wrong door at their Multiplex Cinema!!Fun, fast-paced disaster movie with pretty good effects... ..did you seriously expect more??? duh...",San Andreas

I'm glad I went to a free preview screening, I would have be thoroughly annoyed had I paid £15 to watch it.Spoilers below: From the opening scene's it was clear this movie was going to be far fetched. With liberal use of CGI ""because we can"" not stopping to think whether they should or not.Some bits work fine - the Hoover Dam for instance is a realistic enough scene, but the movie just descends into farce rather quickly.For instance - Kylie Minogue appears randomly for about 30 seconds before she jumps to her death. The action sequences get more and more far fetched and the main characters survive them all with barely a scratch. This lack of realism and sanity just made it all a bit of an ever increasing farce.The use of cheesy comedy lines don't help - it's a movie that you just cannot take seriously, and for me that spoiled my enjoyment of an otherwise well made film.",San Andreas

Especially the last was very disappointing, the acting performances have never been believable. There never was a flirt between Raymond and Emma, and the flirt between Emma and her new boyfriend were non-existent. From the beginning on you can feel that these two will probably get back together, we've seen that a thousand times before. The special effects were kind of cool, but it's totally Unbelievable that everyone dies and our main characters are just running through the streets with falling buildings, or are even climbing on falling buildings and jumping in a helicopter. Seriously? The love story between Ben and Blake is terrible to watch, or is that because of the horrible accent of the little brother? All by all,predictable and unbelievable from start to finish. And the American flag in the end just made me wanna puke. This could have been so much better.",San Andreas

Acting was truly awful, CGI was about as good as something you would see in an early 90s movie. Directing was also painfully bad, you sit through this film and not care about what happens to any the main characters, so predictable, used, stale.

Not every movie is going to be an Oscar winner, sometimes you just want a little escapism and to be entertained, this does just that.

This is my first review, only made to let others know not to bother with this. if you have an hour to kill why not see how many pins you can stick in your eye in one go. That will hurt your eyes less than watching this movie!Ha, for some reason I must pad this review to ten lines long. So, what else could you do for an hour that would not be as bad as this movie?

I know it's a big blockbuster and made to leave the viewer in awe, but I just laughed at it. My partner and I sat and said what was going to happen next and it did. The plot was dire from the start and I was kind of hoping the film would end before it had even got half way through it. Why do they always have Brits in American films who sound like they are so posh? Totally not called for. The acting was OK and I like Dwayne Johnson, but this was beneath him.

576,samwalmsley,Typical Dwayne Johnson action packed movie that compromises facts for action,7,2 June 2018,"I enjoyed watching this film as it's your typical Dwayne Johnson action packed movie with enough ""action"" and ""disaster"" scenes to keep you entertained even though early on in the film you start to realise that they have compromised reality and scientific fact for dramatic scenes. My one main observation of this film is that, however much I like her as an actress, Alexandra Daddario's role in this movie seems to be more about how many scenes they could get her in running in a low cut top rather than using her to her full acting potential. Don't get me wrong I'm not complaining about this and I know pretty much the whole story line is centred around her character being rescued but I just feel they overkilled the scenes with her running in a wet or low cut top to compensate for lack of reality and the amount of continuity errors in this film.Over all I enjoyed watching San Andreas with the none stop start to finish action and some very well shot disaster scenes but infeel they could have cut down a bit on The two female leads ""revealing"" outfits and it would have still been a decent fun to watch.Again I'm not complaining about the use of very attractive women in low cut tops but it almost feels like they knew this film wasn't going to be amazing so they tried to compensate by showing a fair bit of cleavage throughout haha.Anyway I enjoyed the film and would recommend it for one of those ""I'm bored and fancy an easy to watch"" film nights :)",San Andreas
577,karla-marciszewski,Suspension of Belief,7,3 July 2016,"I did not see this movie in the theater. I saw it on DVD. And while there were a great many ""goofs"" and required a great deal of suspension of belief, it was ... well, I don't know exactly. I did enjoy the movie despite the issues with it.My biggest beef with the movie was the scene with Natalie driving on a mountain highway loaded with curves and oncoming traffic, yet she takes her eyes from the road to 1. reach for her water bottle in her bag behind the front seats. 2. She then reads a text message on her cell phone - again taking her eyes from the road.I found that very disturbing because the amount of influence movies and actors have on people today. They see it on TV or in a movie and think it's okay. A good many states have laws in place regarding the use of cell phones while driving. That whole scene was highly irresponsible.",San Andreas

There is virtually nothing to redeem the film. If I had not seen it, I would never have believed that Hollywood, for which I have the highest respect, had made this atrocious Movie. I thoroughly agree with all the earlier Reviewers who have panned this Film, who have highlighted all that is ridiculous about this film, and really there is not very much I can add to what has already been written.

Yes it's action packed and not short of minute by minute CGI rubbish but if you thought that maybe somebody like Liam Neeson in Taken was a bit cheesy, full of one-liners and very far fetched then honestly DO NOT watch this movie which is full of wasted actors and again cheesy and stupid one-liners.

The plot may have made more sense if the director had made visible the golden spheres of immortality that surrounded each of the main characters, which imbued them with super-powers such as: * Skin impenetrable to the falling debris of a city-worth of skyscrapers * Telepathic / homing powers to draw them easily together in a huge wasteland compromising the rubble of a whole city * Amphibious physiology, to allow them not only to survive under water but to hold conversations and scream and shout without drowning * Resurrection skills, to allow them to be revived 15 minutes after death * Force-of-nature deflector aura, which allowed their balance/bodies/small boats/helicopters to be unaffected by the largest earthquake the world has event witnessed and the collapse of 80 story buildings and splash of steel shipping containers mere feet away.I spent the movie trying to gnaw a sharp point onto a pencil to give myself means to end the madness.

581,e-mitchell-2014,Love the movie,10,20 October 2015,Saw this for the first time last month and absolutely loved it. But one glaring problem...or rather inside joke.It seems in almost every disaster movie I've seen that the parents are either divorced or in the process of divorce at the beginning. But along the line of the entire movie the boyfriend of the mom gets killed in some way. And then in the end they get back together.But despite this recurring issue I still like the movie.And another thing about this movie.I love Ioan Gruffudd in his other works including Amazing Grace. But in this...oh my god! I hated his character and actually laughed at his death.But out of everything I love this movie and would definitely recommend this to family and friends.,San Andreas

Nuke Reactors? what's about that?) wasn't part of the Movie.But the thrill was OK, except the many stereotype Characters and Moves. I think, San Andreas is a OK Disaster Movie with nice FX.

Luckily, for Blake, nothing danger happens to her while her parents are busy with their emotions.CGI - nothing out of the world. Was short of expectations for this kind of movie.

Mostly because none of the other reviews I read on IMDb, 10 min prior to seeing this movie, did it any justice! In short the motives are very clear: parents looking for their kid in a disaster zone and kid trying to get to parents. That's all you need to know and all that's going to happen, now here comes the part that makes the movie amazing. Somebody thought very long and very hard about how to crack down California in a visually stunning and perfectly shot way. The movie is one of four movies coming out this year shot in full 3D and holy smokes man it looks amazing. The detail in every shot, movement everywhere the depth in these huge structures cracking up. Simply amazing, every single shot benefited from the full 3D experience making the suspense unbearable. The disasters just don't stop till you walk out of the theater pumped with adrenaline. If you want to go for a very nice ride please do yourself a favor and watch the movie. And watch it in 3D! Don't give in to the skeptics, it's just their loss! Also I would like to thank the team that made this movie, thank you for making my sleeper hit of this year.

There was an abundance of great characters, including British- mark- wahlberg-Jeremy-renner-man-crossover, and good old Dwayne himself. Dwayne looks fresh as can be, wearing those yeezys like he was born to. Not to mention his aviators which he wore for like five minutes, but were worn with style. He also manages to be a realistic hard helicopter man, despite the fact that he will never be as muscular as Paul. There was an abundance of destruction in this film, it was like a Michael bay wet dream, but a realistic wet dream. Talking of wet, Dwayne caught some gnarly waves in that tsunami, totally rad. And the mister fantastic face got what was coming to him. Rip Dwayne's helicopter. It will be missed, he rescued all if two people in it. Rip Dwayne's house, it got totally leveled. It was like a geological bulldozer had ran through the city. This film was better than 2012, and pays tribute to Paul walker and the Nepal earthquake of recent.

The plot wasn't even a little bit original and everything was full of clichés and corny lines. Too much! 3 stars was for the effects. They were pretty good even though it was wasted on nonsense. The acting was pretty decent too. You just can't appreciate it when they are spewing out stupid lines the writers made them say.

It was a constant energy through the film, one thing after another. Nonetheless, it didn't defer my enjoyment. Most of all, it made me extremely anxious about living California... The casting for the film was so so, however each of the actors did a terrific job in my opinion. They ech played their character believably, and consistently. The story line of the film is also a little cheesy and predictable, but they pull it off well as there are many very realistic moments in the film to balance out the not so realistic moments. The most amazing part of the whole movie were the special effects. They were absolutely superb. My favourite special effect is the birds eye view of an earth quake- an enormous ripple across California! SO COOL! It will have you holding onto your seat the entire time! GO SEE IT!",San Andreas
589,gdubey-19218,There are many better disaster movies. This was bad. Don't watch it.,3,6 June 2015,"One star for Dwayne Johnson, who did a good job in the role he was given (like better than expected). One star for Alexandra Daddario, who looked gorgeous and fitted in the role quite well. One for everything else.Quite early in the movie, an earthquake broke the dam but couldn't knock off people who were just standing next to it. Behold.So... This a movie about a rescue team chopper pilot and all he has to do in the whole movie is save his family and nobody else during a devastating earthquake and everything goes perfect for him. He had a chopper (in which he rescued his wife) but he had to abandon it because it was going to crash (it did); then he found an easy way to steal a truck (perfect), but while driving the truck he came at a point where the earth had cracked wide open so he found an old man who found him an airplane (perfect). Then he realised his plane was going to nose drive into the ocean so he parachuted along with his wife (perfectly) on the 2nd base of a baseball stadium, and then he found a boat and drove it to where he found his daughter. Why didn't the rescue team call ""The Rock"" at a time of catastrophe to get back to duty?But guys, get real. Thats not how perfectly things go during a 9.6 earthquake. How easy was it for him to drive his boat right over the tsunami wave. Quite unrealistic. Everything goes perfect for ONE family in California and thats all thats going on, no one else is even told about. Bottom line is one family finds the easier ways to survive and the other millions ... die. Million dollars of taxpayers' money spent to save 4 people, where he could have rescued many more, with the ease he was going through.Moreover, (to end) if the epicentre was in Nevada, how was the tsunami be directed towards mainland California?So, to describe it in short: Unrealistic, unpractical, and quite predictable at times. But good work done by Dwayne Johnson, Alexandra Daddario. The team that worked on the visual effects could have done better instead of overdoing it.",San Andreas

We can care deeply, selflessly about those we know. But that empathy rarely extends beyond our line of sight.'. that quote sums up the characters in this movie, they are all looking out for number one, and at best number two, unlikable characters.cheesy moments and lines are through the roof, riddled with clichés (surprise, surprise).there is no redeeming feature of the movie, its so bad id rather watch tooth fairy than this garbage. save your self the torture, you owe it to your self.",San Andreas

A straight 10 out of 10! If you had any sense about you, you will watch this!",San Andreas
593,barbiegerl,Edge of my seat throughout the whole movie!,10,31 May 2015,"I loved it 100% for it's entertainment value. I shouted ""holy crap"" several times during the show without even realizing it. I love The Rock and he performed exactly how I expected (though I was hoping he'd take his shirt off at least once) and the action and special effects were out of this world, over the top, and effing awesome. Story was strong, believable, with increasing action. I was absolutely blown away with the reality with which everything was shown. Mega cudos to the graphics folks for totally making me believe this was real. Telling all my friends to go see it. Anything that happened in the movie that was questionable to believe, is secondary to how entertained I was. It's a movie folks and it totally delivers!!!!!",San Andreas
594,vickorty,Literally Jawdropping,10,31 May 2015,"When I entered the theatre, I thought it to be another 2012. But it is different, in a positive way. I did not notice whether the actors did a good job or not, as I was mesmerized by the trembling world, created by awesome visual effect.Dwayne Johnson was great in role of muscle flexing bad-ass, savior. Alexandra Daddario was OK for her role of looking beautiful and smart, daddy's girl. Something more was expected from Mr.Fantastic Ioan Gruffudd, but he seemed to be used only to show Carla was going to make a bad decision.There were some interesting staffs were also shown, which will be helpful in time of real disaster.If you are not a critique, and don't want to waste energy to find technical faults; you will love this movie.And please watch it in 3D.",San Andreas
595,aled_holcombe,Good but could of been better,6,1 June 2015,"Stereotypical American disaster movie, well worth a watch and action throughout! only major let downs were the ""English"" characters accent ( I don't think i have have ever heard a more fake or annoying attempt at one) which really irritated me throughout the film. The ending is also stereotypically American and very predictable, with the line ""We must rebuild"" and American flag being strongly featured, adding a level of cheesiness the film could of done without. All in all the rocks performance is strong and he makes the film, would definitely recommend watching! don't say i didn't warn you about the ""English"" guy! the visual effects in this film will grip you to your seat and really made the entire film!",San Andreas
596,tyfox,welcome to 1970's godzilla special effects,1,2 June 2015,"acting movie was OK for elementary children. special effects.... really? is Hollywood bankrupt? 2012 at least made a effort. why was that mustang crawling toward town? I really was looking forward to the movie. hope the decade of remakes has something worth watching. Robocop was pathetic the first time heard poltergeist was a flop, how many remakes of batman can we make isn't there any more writers? It cost about $30.00 for a movie ticket, popcorn candy an pop and listening to broken speakers theater experience has gone downhill and so has your effort. the world isn't that slow to recognize the lame effort Hollywood is giving us. it is why my town had 4 theaters and is reduced to one over the last 3 decades.",San Andreas
597,mscha,Neutered Rock =/ Sub-par,4,2 June 2015,"Expecting our summer time destruction to us cities in the theaters, i expected not an award winning screen play but... The special effects felt sub par, even when compared to older movies the effects looked to many times very fake. Studio def held back costs on this movie.Avoiding spoilers ..Scenario unrealistic, VERY. The Tsunami wave, i just cant let go of this one.. Over 245 feet from a tectonic shift inland.. What are they thinking, they passed the damaged as if san Francisco was sea level also.The Rock is awesome but very under utilized and even in a way neutered for this role. Didn't feel any character chemistry besides the very lame dialog which felt stated more then meant. ""which is expected for this kind of movie"" but it was even lamer then a Roland Emmerich & Micheal Bay movie combined. Was not impressed. Could have been, should have been, wasn't! Could have made for a high quality FX channel movie..",San Andreas
598,danielcarlostan-34752,Was this a sequel?,6,3 June 2015,"At first I knew I was watching San Andreas, but after the movie I thought I just watched 2012. Lots of ground shaking and breaking, car-napping, oh! and plane-napping too skipping falling skyscrapers, near close calls, a genius scientist who's smart enough to predict almost everything that's gonna happen, and there's this tsunami that I thought would not be possible if the epicenter of the earthquake is in-land. Good thing they never made gigantic modern arks too. So it's almost the same old thrilling (boring) experience. Overall, the movie itself was nice, good special-effects, nice choice of casts, with good script. If it wasn't Dwayne Johnson here, I wouldn't have watched the movie.",San Andreas
599,rjone-54933,Not impressed,3,4 June 2015,"I don't know where all the positive reviews of this movie are coming from but I personally believe that this movie was lackluster. To me, anyone with half a brain could predict what was going to happen next from beginning to end. I love Dwayne Johnson, ( He's absolutely gorgeous and keeps his body looking awesome) but his acting was mediocre at best. From the beginning of the plot there were bad choices. I felt like the main characters made stupid freaking choices that people would not make in real life. I hate when movies have stupid or unrealistic characters. Overall, a little disappointed in this film. I would definitely say save your money and wait until this movie comes out on DVD or Blu-ray",San Andreas
600,rexpsunny,Funny facts about San Andreas - Read after watching movie :P,6,4 June 2015,See the funny facts about San Andreas. Actually I was noticing all these facts once I watched the movie. Overall movie is good. Dwayne Johnson did a great job as usual. Those who likes fantasy movies will like it for sure. But somehow somewhere they missed the story line.Female actor is hot and good. They could have done something about people in the city like saving them instead of focusing on the family matters! The effects and 3D is overall OK. There is not much 3D scenes like coming objects to our eyes etc.Read it here bit.Ly/SanAndreasReviews Caution: Read this funny facts after watching the movie,San Andreas
601,christopherdonburgess,Special effects made the movie,7,4 June 2015,"I went into the movie expecting that it could possibly be a let down however I was quite pleased with the movie overall. The special effects were great and though there were a few cheesy part with the story line, it was a great plot in general.I'm not a huge fan of The Rock as it comes to movies but he played the part pretty spot on. I could tell he was really versed in the science that went into the movie. Would I go see it in the theater again, probably not. But I will definitely look for it on Red Box.7/10",San Andreas
602,ferdyyanto,"Lack of plot, but still fun to watch",9,5 June 2015,"Warning: this review maybe contain spoiler:The first thing: i think i will think this will be disappointment, because San Andreas is not movie GTA San Andreas, a famous video game made by Rockstar games. But after i watch the movie, i'm wrong. this film is very good. the effect is very nice. is very fun to watch the building collapsed or tsunami enter and destroy the city.The negative point only the story maybe little pushed, and seems lack of plot. that's is Dwayne "" ray"" is go with helicopter save his family in the city. and Emma seems like super women or something. in that collapse restaurant building only Emma who can survive, he can run and jump to reach ray helicopter ( well at least this is movie... :))For gamer maybe notice this: Dwayne driving many type of vehicles. first helicopter, second is pick up car, hot wiring it like GTA China town wars, then airplane, finally speedboat. and i believe the news say about Los Santos.....At least this movie is great and very fun to watch, the dialog in the movie is very good. the actor performance is good, the effect is awesome. at least better you watch this movie in theater rather than DVD/blue ray, unless you have home theater in your home.",San Andreas
603,gschoots,Mediocre,3,6 June 2015,"In short: I didn't like the movie and I wouldn't recommend watching it. The special effects were special, in the way that you tell kids with down syndrome they are special, the story was realistic like biblical stories are realistic and in the required attention span google wasn't able to give me any search results. *********Spoilers begin here. Just read it, because you don't want to watch the movie********Seriously though, this movie contains a lot of action, too much and too random in my opinion. The causes for action were far fetched, like the rhino escaping and the dead tunnel guy. Not a single minute goes without screaming or explosions. CGI was really bad, it was used everywhere and it looks like stickers. Also do not forget the crazy love story in there, seriously how unrealistic do you want to make a story? A step mom/failed scientist who has a shitty relation with her step daughter and looks down on a student who, turns out, had a difficult youth and a relation with the stepdaughter. After they rescue the stepdaughter, with a ton of action, everyone loves each other and just when the situation seems hopeless they get rescued by three people and a dog in a chopper which got repaired, for just 10 grand, in a few hours after the owner said it had huge technical problems and he needed to make parts for it, while he was in a hurry to escape the earthquakes. And don't forget the first chopper that got blown up by a plane that crashed in it when all the occupants were standing just a few meters away, but luckily none of them got injured.And they lived happily ever after!",San Andreas
604,vassafb,I couldn't finish it,3,1 May 2021,"I spent the week in a mood for disasters, watched The Day After Tomorrow and 2012 from Roland Emmerich. And got this movie recommended to me by a list I found on Google and it had actors I like. I wasn't expecting much from it, but man it was bad... I couldn't finish it.Nothing in this movie is convincing... earthquakes destroy building in a completely unbelievable way... choppers moves that don't make any sense.The relationship between characters is so badly written, full of clichés (I know Roland Emmerich's movies are also full of clichés too but there's something believable about them)... I don't know what to write here, I'm no critic. I made this account just to say this movie is really bad.",San Andreas
605,jaganivasmayengbam,Waste of time. Don't watch it,4,8 June 2015,"The story makes no sense and illogical. Even if it is a fiction movie the story must make sense. The scenes are not co-ordinated. In one scene the whole thing is in a mess and immediately in the next scene everything is all clear and super fine not even a dirt is visible. This clean and mess scene is repeated innumerable times making the movie a super flop. It doesn't make sense that a workspace / room in a complete mess to become a perfect well furbished room in the next scene.Big Tsunami waves are shown every now and then. but the route of the hero (rescuer), while riding the motor boat, has no waves. The water is calm and still. It doesn't make sense at all.The only good part is the superb computer generated scenes and the worse thing is the non co-ordination of the scenes",San Andreas
606,jeffcoley-97560,Of all the highly implausible things in this movie ...,7,9 June 2015,"The most implausible is that Dwayne Johnson and Carla Gugino have a blue-eyed daughter who looks like Alexandra Daddario. This film is a rollicking good time. Although it is predictable and follows the summer blockbuster disaster film template to a ""T"", it still manages to be very entertaining. I was a bit taken aback when Dwayne Johnson's character takes his county-owned rescue helicopter and strikes out across country on his own mission, leaving the LAFD without its badly needed chopper. He then proceeds to steal a variety of vehicles before finding his daughter in the ruins of San Francisco even as the disaster continues to unfold. Knowing how difficult it is to find my wife or kids in Walmart without a natural disaster, that is the 2nd most unbelievable part of the movie. Do check it out, though.",San Andreas
607,mccallions-35755,I would rather chew on tin foil than sit through this again,1,13 June 2015,"There are some movies, while they are not really suited to your personal preferences, can still be enjoyable on some level. This is not one of them. Poorly written with robotic actors spouting predictable lines, I just do not have the words to express what an utter waste of time this movie was. Yes, the visual effects are big and loud. Hang on to that thread because after the first 20 minutes of watching buildings falling over, this movie has little else to offer. San Andreas fails in every category; it is a boring disaster movie, a predictable action film, a poor date flick and a worse thriller. This movie is at best, the 6 a.m. filler movie at a drive-in all nighter. A summer cash grab with no redeeming value. Consider going to get that colonoscopy done that you have been putting off, maybe a root canal or a face tattoo would be a better choice. Your call.",San Andreas
608,gnduffy,Best movie of the year,10,16 June 2015,"Okay I haven't been to the theater since 2011 , but this was a reason to go back . At last this movie shows the real issue our world could face. This movie touches my heart for reason I will always pray for . Love the rock , I have to say he looks like the new super hero. This movie should get a academy award because we need to acknowledge the problems that our world need help with fixing a lot of problems . And sexy men like Dwanye Johnson just rocks. Lol ,,omg that man I tell you wow ,Not sure who his agent is ,but thumbs up showing his true work . Can't wait to buy this movie . Thank you again for this movie all the actors . One of the best movie of this year.♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️",San Andreas
609,brulsturm,Getting divorced? Hope for an earthquake!,5,21 June 2015,"Wow, what lot of special effects, in 3D. And what a good looking young lady. That was enjoyable to watch. And now for the not so nice aspects of this movie. In case you have forgotten the meaning of the word ""cliché"" this is a very good movie to watch. It is just unbelievable how you can see almost everything coming in this movie. Although I really wanted to give this movie a chance and knew nothing about it, beforehand, and the first part wasn't that bad, I couldn't stop laughing once the main character saved his (ex)wife from the roof. From that point cliché after cliché fills the screen.Also, every time you hear someone in this movie say ""It's gonna be all right"" then in almost all cases they better could have said ""You have a very high chance of dying next 10 minutes""And then, really? Of course, when you see your daughter almost drowning, in front of your eyes, you keep talking to her, for 2 minutes, until the water rises too high and she actually inhales water, before you get in action and try to find something to smash the glass....And why are there so many visual references to 9/11? Or is that just me.",San Andreas
610,gromeobilugan,the actors are not acting,1,21 June 2015,"the actors are really trying to act as in:they are just ""trying to act"".graphics or special effect are like ewww.after seeing the landslides in the first helicopter scene, i stopped watching.and i think i do not have to write ten lines for a bad movies.why would i need ten lines when i can say this in two or three sentences?and this is my first review on the net!I really just can't accept that there are those who try to sold a murky river water for an ale!and i still need a line or two!so here it is.",San Andreas
611,soyun-15788,must watch this,7,22 June 2015,"I late 30 minute to go in because of some reason, and i saw that building was falling down then 2 women was in restaurant and earthquake was happened. San Andreas is about earthquake happened and dad saved family. Finally San Andreas' fault broke and it occurs 9.5 earthquake. everyone was escaping from building and Ray was in helicopter and contact with Emma. at that time i thought if helicopter with full of fuel, when earthquake happens helicopter will be the most safe place. anyway, the most impressive scene was Thsunami scene, and i thought 2011 Japan Thsunami. when daughter stuck in water, her dad broke things and saved her, i also nervous and afraid. Disaster scene was so scared because too realistic. anyway i hope more people watch this.",San Andreas
612,elijohansenelite,"I'll try to keep it short, but God this movie was awful...",1,9 July 2015,"Buildings fall over, people scurry left to right, blah,blah,blah, end of movie.The rock is just a piece of meat with no talent as usual. The romance in this movie is comical and contrived at best. The plot is... buildings falling. What else is there to say? That little British kid was annoying. Yup, that's about it for San Andreas The only redeeming factor this movie had was that if this were to happen, ~50% of all the communists in the USA would be swimming with the fishes, other than that, this movie sucked, hard.If you like special effects, this movie may be redeemed by the fact that the special effects were quite good, but that's one of the few saving graces.This will happen in California one day as well, just a matter of time!",San Andreas
613,aliciachampion,What is San Andreas About?,10,28 July 2015,I don't know about you but I am a natural disaster freak so when San Andreas came out I had to see it. If you have not yet seen the movie and wanted a summary to decide then here it goes- The city and surrounding areas of Los Angeles have been having a few minor earthquake tremors a day for a couple of days now and people are starting to worry. When Geographers say that the worst of the quake was over they were lying. A much bigger problem is lurking on the horizon. A 10.0 earthquake! Its all about Survival when Ray (Dwayne Johnson) tries to beat the natural disasters ahead of them to save his daughter (Alexandra Daddario) and wife (Carla Gugino)and bring them to safety,San Andreas
614,nikolagrigorov,I love Alexandra,10,27 August 2015,"I am here to answer questions that you might have. First and most importantly. Alexandra Daddario is hot throughout the whole movie. There wasn't a scene with her that I wasn't pleased with watching her 'creeperly'.About the movie itself. If you like scenarios based on Natural disasters you will love this movie. I think its the best one out there in its genre. In my opinion everyone played their role good I loved the dramatic off-story between father daughter and ex-wife. And the way characters develop. The CGI is amazing I got goosebumps on every disaster scene. The plot is what you'd expect of this kind of movie. All in all 9/10. I might consider giving an extra point because Alexandra is so damn beautiful. Actually yes, 10/10 I love Alexandra. I am out!",San Andreas
615,sanderguilonard,Horriful,2,28 August 2015,"Yes, this movie was horribly awful. The only thing that made me rate this movie an extra star is Dwayne Johnson's somewhat credible acting. The rest of the cast is terrible. The CGI is mediocre at best. The storyline is as bad and unbelievable as 2012. And who the hell thought it was a good idea to give Kylie Minogue an acting role and have her try to pull of an American accent?!And now I'm at a loss for words to express just how much of a piece of cinematic excrement this movie is.Please save yourself the agony and watch something else instead. Just make sure it's sure it's not 2012. Unless you prefer John Cusack over The Rock. But you'll have to put up with Woody Harrelson instead.",San Andreas
616,shammiviren,Good for kids,6,30 August 2015,"I had huge expectation from this movie , was expecting some outstanding 3d effects and story.. Ater watching movie it was more about Mr. ROCK saving his family not others... so why name the movie as San Andreas ??? They tried to show all possible disaster in one shot, earthquake tsunami flood etc and one man is flying all the way to save his family but no other aid to save nation. Logic was missing. Still Good one time watch and specially kids enjoyed it a lot... so I give 6. I would recommend this too. Go for it if you want to enjoy showing your kids all woo effects and teach some lesson on science. Don't expect any story or script.",San Andreas
617,davisalmo,2012 cheaper version 2.0 a.k.a San Cliché,1,4 September 2015,"Where to start? Well I guess I'll write a review with spoilers because things NEEDED to be said.In short the movie is HORRIBLE, it is literally a bad copy of a bad movie (2012). There are so many similarities that the story borders (and step over) plagiarism. Guy who divorced babe that in turn married jerk, ends up hooking back with the old lady because he save her from natural catastrophe and because jerk died. MANY scenes are almost identical in context to 2012 scenes, like couple hugging and peacefully waiting for the wave while everybody is going crazy. How about the 2012 scene when they drive a limo trough a office building? Well that scene is in this movie too, but is a boat, not a limo. But the scene is the very same, as the building collapses they rush to get trough. Look at the credits for this movie:Carlton Cuse (screenplay) Liar you copied the movie! Andre Fabrizio (story) Another liar, you copied the movie!Bawhaha coping much these days? And what's up with the biceps over exposure? He should really go back to the rings, where biceps and extremely bad acting belongs.San Andreas is a localized 2012. When the best actor of the movie is a 12 year old kid you KNOW that there is something wrong. There are dozens of ""last second save"" when in a good movie that is something that CANNOT surpass the count of (MAX OK?!) two. Literally all the time, tens of last sec saves. This movie should be call ""Cheesy world of Murphy's law"". Dwayne Johnson had many many opportunities to prove himself to be an actor, and he did not. He is 100% better than ""Fabius"". Fabius has one expression for all occasions, Dwayne has two, the sad and the happy one, although sometimes is confusing and we misinterpret happy for sad and vice versa.Impossible and ultra mega pro ridiculous things happen all the time. I'll write about some. For instance, tilting a helicopter sideways to go down into a canyon so the Helli fits into the gap DOES NOT explain how can you do the same to get out of the canyon. Maybe the gap widened while he was in...In another scene a guy get's a piece of glass the size of a pack of cigarettes shoved into his leg, then comes the girl and pulls the glass out like it is a little torn, very easily with the tips of her fingers, and to finish the ridiculous scene she ties a piece of cloth on his leg like she is tying her shoes. NO! The tying deal Mr director is to CUT BLOOD CIRCULATION so one don't die. So the knot has to be SUPER TIED, OK!? Not a cute band-aid of cloth. Uber ridiculous and unreal.In another surreal scene Dwayne drives a propeller boat very fast in waters that are literally full of debris. We barely can see the water because of the amount of debris floating on the water. Mr. director/writer the propeller is gonna be blown in 1000 pieces in a real similar situation. Next time try to give them a jet boat, or slow down the boat, OK?! You cannot drive a propeller boat over debris that fast...Yet another super ridiculous scene is when Dwayne has a gun pointed to his face at a distance of 5 inches. But as we all know he is faster than light. He takes the gun from the assailant's hand before getting shot in the face. Yeah, just like on the real world! The movie is like Call of Duty. We go from helicopter to truck to plane to parachute to boat to.. well I stopped the movie before the end, but I bet they will end up in the space shuttle.How about Carla Gugino acting? The world is ending and she is making jokes and making advances on her ex. She is sad, now she is smiling, now she is sad, now she is horny. Ridiculous surreal acting and directing. Yeah like we saw a LOT of people smiling on the day Katrina stroke New Orleans. Writers directors and actors, when a catastrophe of this magnitude happens, NO ONE LAUGHS FOR AT LEAST A WEEK! OK?!At the end, the daughter is ""dead"" for like 5 minutes or so after drowning. Square one, she now is brain damaged, OK mr ""writer""?! Square two... I would give a 2 for this movie if the girl died, but in the end, just yet another cliché: guys gives dead person cpr for 5 minutes and nothing happens, guy gives up.. (one more minute of winning) guy tries again, and all of the sudden dead comes to life... Cliché - Cliché - Cliché - Cliché - Cliché - Cliché - Cliché - Cliché - Cliché - Cliché in a fraction of a second I can remember 2 recent movies that did the very same: Sorcerer apprentice, terminator salvation. I probably could find tens of them.If you have an IQ of 40 or more let me save you money and time: DO NOT WATCH THIS JUNK! DO NOT RENT IT, DO NOT BUY IT. You have been warned!! I'll rate it 1 only because I cannot rate zero or negative, because if I could, I most certainly would.And to finish, what makes me really angry is that some real life jerk got paid thousands if not millions of dollars to ""write"" this. Next time don't make a movie and send the money to Africa, or some Asian country for the relief of the poor. That would be a win win scenario, helping the needed and saving us from junk products like this. I'll never watch a Dwayne Johnson movie again! I don't want EVER see him, his biceps or his triangular head ever again.",San Andreas
618,cognocraig,Director needed to talk to people who have actually been in earthquakes,2,8 September 2015,"Was looking forward to this but almost turned it off after the first earthquake scene. The director should have at least watched some real videos of earthquakes.To be chatting and running in those sort of earthquakes is simply impossible and kills the atmosphere. An large earthquake is as loud as a truck driving past and almost impossible to stand upright during, let alone running back and forth across dams etc.I realise this is a small thing but hey it's what the entire movie was based around so getting the basics right would have helped.Acting was average (5 out of 10), special effects OK (6 out of 10), far to many ""coincidences"" which actually push the movie over the point of ridiculously bad (1 out of 10).",San Andreas
619,amianaby,Great disaster movie,10,25 September 2015,"This movie is first for Californians then for blinder than bat people.The first scene with the subaru and the blonde thats Topanga and Auzsa canyon, yes they do crumble and they do eff people up, thats just ""normal""San Andreas fault and Hayward Fault are about to go off any day now..itll be 9.0+ so more or less what you see in the movie can turn into reality, not as bad but bad enough...so for us CALIFORNIANS that live in SF bay area we feel and understand this movie, basically an EXAGGERATED example to wake people up and give them an idea of how bad could it get, so we kinda know what will happen and if you lucky to stay alive what should we do, i cant believe how much production and work went into bringing idea as such on screen and gotta say they did a good job, because if you use your brain its too much details to capture and bring together, most people who rate this bad are just ungrateful clowns...this movie is not easy to make unless you are delusional from your couch as many people are.I LOVED it on the screen in reality i hope it never happens here but we all know its just matter of time.",San Andreas
620,feariste,Peyton's San Andreas leaves watchers breathless,9,29 September 2015,"Before watching Brad Peyton's ""San Andreas"" (2015), I expected to witness all heck breaking loose in California and Nevada as the earthquake ravaged the west coast. I did not however, expect a love story in the mix of events. Now, I must say, if you're expecting a chick flick, this isn't the movie you're looking for. Ray (Dwayne Johnson) known for his roles in Fast and Furious 6 and 7 as well as G.I. Joe, plays the role as a fire and rescue-chopper pilot divorced by his ex wife Emma (Carla Gugino). The divorced couple travels across the state of California in search of their daughter Blake (Alexandra Daddario) after Emma's boyfriend Daniel Riddick (Ioan Gruffudd) abandons her. Meanwhile, Blake tries to find her parents alongside two British acquaintances Ben (Hugo Johnstone-Burt) and his brother Ollie (Art Parkinson) that she met that day. At several parts of the film, the action and realistic perspective leaves you breathless. The film makers did an amazing job at bringing you into the action of the real event of the earthquake that occurred. The film itself is best enjoyed by those with an interest in intense dramatic action and those with a love of movies based off of real events. Steven Rea; The Inquirer states ""San Andreas is awesome fun. Director Brad Peyton and his army of visual effects and digital artists have created a temblor tableau of wreckage in motion."" Entertainment Weekly's Jeff Labreque claims that ""It seems familiar , lacks depth or perspective, and isn't based in science."" While this is in some ways true, Labreque misses the point. If every movie was 100% accurate, the intended audience population as a whole, would be a lot less.",San Andreas
621,pcprince-08675,Amazing!!!!!!,8,11 October 2015,"I've watched San Andreas long back and was thinking to rate this.Bravo!! Amazing work done by director and its whole team. Movies are rated based on many parameters, sometimes even if the movie is excellent due to low rating people don't watch one. But this one is really mind blowing. Although it has an overall low rating but guys this is gonna give all sorts of feeling e.g. Emotions love, scary at times, thrill and a lot of lessons to learn. Watch it when you get time asap. I'm sure it won't disappoint you, though will make you feel proud that today you have watched something really very good. Thanks, PcPrince",San Andreas
622,alycwy,San Andreas is an awesome movie.,8,23 October 2015,"San Andreas is a movie about mostly disasters such as earthquake and tsunami and also facing family problems. It is a movie which is quite unpredictable yet interesting. The main character, Dwayne Johnson, Ray Gaines in the movie was a great dad and husband and he was also a hero. Other than just watching the movie, viewers could learn about what to do and what not to do when disasters happens. But, main actor, Dwayne Johnson was not really injured though he went through many disasters. The filming techniques are all very good, especially the special effects of the visual. Overall, it's a awesome movie, I really enjoyed it.",San Andreas

624,malcolmfrater,Classic American Drivel,1,11 January 2016,"The usual San Francisco earthquake scenario.What the main character was capable of doing was nobody's business.Firstly, putting everyone's life at risk, flying a rescue helicopter, he carried out a manoeuvre where the gap to rescue a victim wasn't wide enough at the top of the fault. He said, gung-ho style, "" I'm gonna do 'such and such' a manoeuvre ( I don't recall the name), and tilted the helicopter at an angle so that the blades, would pass through.He also possessed a pilots' licence, as I said..... ""What else is this man capable of?""He gave his daughter CPR when she drowned and failed at the first attempt. A couple of minutes later he tried again successfully. From what I was taught, CPR does not have a very high success rate. After 5 minutes a doctor would call a halt to proceedings because the patient would be then either brain damaged or brain dead. No she comes back to life completely healthy.At the very end of the film we see the Golden Gate Bridge with the American flag fluttering, and our character saying ""We will rebuild."" Very cheesy.It seemed, from the packaging, that it was going to be a good film but didn't fulfill its promise. £19.99 down the drain!!",San Andreas
625,rollercoastermaui,"""Earthquake"" from 1974 was better than this.",4,15 January 2016,"At least in that film you cared a little about the characters, and believe it or not, most of the ""special effects"" worked better. As did the realistic challenges of facing a disaster of that magnitude. The CGI destruction on LA in ""San Andreas"" is nearly indistinguishable from what we saw in ""2012"". And the close up scenes just don't work as the camera is too focused on the actors faces and Dwayne Johnson's biceps rather than the action we paid to see in the first place. Like most films that rely too much on CGI, the destruction just isn't believable, and happens too fast in several scenes for you to understand what you're looking at. However I have to admit that finally seeing San Francisco take it up the Richter Scale scored high with me.",San Andreas
626,dongchancha,Bad,1,10 February 2016,"I'm not like this movie at all, I think it presented on a way too much and make me said ""such a fool"". first thing in my mind when earthquake happen people should run to the nearest meeting point not run into the top of a building. and everyone is panic i don't know how a person fall down from a table like a drunk person, how a chef burn or people just scared and stay on their place not running away. a rescue person using an instance helicopter like that is his personal helicopter to save his own family not public that he should to save them all. and where the other rescue people? I just watch a half of this movie and I don't like it at all.",San Andreas
627,jwhuber,I expected more,3,28 February 2016,"The Rock did a good job with what was given to him... but the corny, predictable story line and the absolutely cheesy CGI effects had everyone in my house laughing. The only reason I kept watching was for the... well, I'm a guy... so, yeah. And no helo pilot in his right mind would ever think of pulling some of the maneuvers that were shown. They could have easily stayed above the gorge and lowered the line down a bit longer. The boat that they borrowed near the end would have had a fouled or broken propeller within 1 minute of traveling in the flooded and debris filled city. Also, if so many people died during the tsunami, where were all of the floating bodies? We saw what kind of devastation can happen with a large tsunami years ago in Asia. Overall, not impressed at all with the movie.",San Andreas
628,summerleighetheridge,Johnson doesn't seize to amaze,9,28 March 2016,"It's another gripping tail where you are on the edge of your seat throughout. A tale including heartbreak, misery and loss. From real life events such as Earthquakes and Tsunamis to real life pain.One father won't stop to find his daughter amongst the crowds of suffering, dying and hurt people. He first has to help his wife but can he save two people at once?San Andreas lays in ruins but he won't stop. Johnson plays the character immensely, he truly shows his true colours as a fighter, he refuses to allow his family to lose anyone else.A must watch movie. 9 out of 10 as I didn't want it to end and I had goosebumps throughout.",San Andreas
629,gslvan,"Another ""suspension of disbelief"" disaster movie",5,24 September 2015,"If you're able to suspend your disbelief and just take the movie for what it is, then you'll might enjoy the special effects and action. There's lots of that with the ground everywhere splitting up and swallowing everything, skyscrapers crashing down, the Golden Gate Bridge disintegrates, an 100 ft Tsunami sweeps into San Francisco, the Hoover Dam crumbles - all of which is not what would happen but hey, it's a movie. All through mayhem the Rock manages to navigate the destruction using various modes of transport- a helicopter, a car, an air plane, and a boat - to rescue his wife and daughter from the middle of San Francisco. None of them sustain hardly a scratch with all the falling debris and the family reconciles after their ordeal. Near the end there is a cheesy moment with the huge American flag draped off the destroyed Golden Gate bridge that is supposed to rally the people and inspire ""hope"".As a plot line it is pretty weak - the Rock deals with one obstacle after another looking for his family. If you're looking for a dramatic thriller, you wouldn't find it here as it's just an action movie with a disaster backdrop and lots of cliché movie moments.",San Andreas
630,oagproductions,Jaw-Dropping Action,10,14 February 2017,"OMG! THIS FILM IS EPIC! I love films with Dwayne in because he is an epic actor! I was watching this about a half hour ago and even when my film had finished, my jaw was still dropped wit amazement!I think the same will happen with you if you watch it!Well, I hope you do watch it, I mean, arrgh... ITS EPIC! I cannot get over the thrilling action and effort put in this film! It must have cost millions upon billions to create the illusion of one of the most beautiful cities in the world fall to pieces!Whoever made this probably has a whole skyscraper filled with cash! Well, in fact an underground bunker because all the skyscrapers fell to pieces in the earthquake so, his/her cash would have been tattered and torn and buried beneath the rubble!Anyways, THIS FILM IS AMAZING!!! GO SEE IT KNOW!!I STILL SEE YOU ARE READING THIS...GO... NOW!!!!!YOU WOULD HATE TO MISS IT!!!!GO!!!!10/10 DEFFO",San Andreas

634,jbrady-95144,A steaming pile of dog faeces,1,27 January 2018,"A very disappointing and lazy film. It had the usual kill off the ethnic minorities first, shame women for divorcing, stereotypical and boring men always saving the helpless women claptrap that we've become accustomed to. The effects were good, but that's where the compliments end. None of the characters were developed properly, and I had to stop myself from falling asleep at watching the predictable and boring love stories unfold. I was rather hoping that the boring and insufferable daughter Blake would be killed off after being (understandably) abandoned in the parking lot by her mothers boyfriend, but no, there was the bumbling English fool that had just met her there to save her. I stopped watching after that, and I would implore you to watch paint dry rather than turn on this drivel.",San Andreas
635,rikjwells-05372,Totally implausible!,3,26 December 2018,"The potential for entertainment value of this film is severely tempered by the persistently implausible action, behaviour and events right from the start! The idea of fiction is to ""suspend disbelief"" but it was simply too ridiculous throughout. The CG was pretty-ish though also obvious in many scenes.The plot is quite shallow.",San Andreas
636,khadiviha,Science who?,6,3 May 2018,"This movie is pretty well made, and directed. I think the actors do a really good job at portraying the fear and devastation that would occur if a major disaster event like this occurred. This movie isn't very scientifically accurate. They get the basic understanding of tectonic plate movement and earthquakes, but they have minor factual errors occurring consistently throughout the film. There's also the extremely unrealistic situations that are played off as Hollywood stunts, like riding through the wave of a tsunami, that are completely scientifically inaccurate. If you can get past the educational faults, it's worth a watch!",San Andreas

638,laurennicole-91832,Good movie (even though my city got destroyed),8,11 September 2018,"I live in San Francisco and it was a bit weird watching it get totally demolished. It was a great movie though, despite all the unbelievable scenes. The Rock is very good in his role.",San Andreas
639,moultrie-84440,The Fault Within the Fault,9,18 September 2018,"Earthquakes lead to tsunamis when your near bodies of water and you don't want to be caught in either one. In this action-packed and American disaster film, starring Dwayne Johnson, Carla Gugino, Alexandra Daddario, and Ioan Gruffudd you won't be able to take your eyes from the screen or stop yourself from sliding to the end of your seat.
 Dwayne Johnson plays Ray, the father and also the man in the helicopter who saves people in distress because of course he has to be a hero with all those muscles. Alexandra Daddario plays Blake, the daughter that is going to college. Carla Gugino plays Emma, the mom. Ioan Gruffudd is some what of the bad guy in this film, he's seeing Emma and offers to take Blake to visit her college and when the disaster happens he's no where to be found. This eventful movie centers on an earthquake caused by the San Andreas Fault, this nine magnitude earthquake is destroying Los Angeles to San Francisco. Ray and Emma set out to save their only daughter together.
 I can picture myself now on the couch with the smell of butter popcorn filling the room as chills run up my spine as I anticipate the next screen. I can't believe my eyes or ears as a lone tear falls. You'll never believe what happened but I don't want to spoil it watch the movie.
 I've read previous reviews and lots of critics called it another typical disaster movie. I, however do not agree it isn't totally about mast destruction of the world. The movie does have a sentimental and very valuable life message. When remove all the destruction you can tell it's very family oriented. 
 Furthermore, I really enjoyed watching the movie it's not your typical disaster movie, the worlds not coming to an end, it's more about the risk your willling to take for your family. I mean we l can't be The Rock.",San Andreas
640,keepaustinweird,Makers of this movie have never been to San Francisco,3,7 October 2018,"Other than the ""non-memorable"" disaster aspects of this film, the geography of it all makes absolutely zero sense. Being a San Franciscan, the most unsavory aspects was how apparent it was the producers took no thought into researching this movie and if the plot made any sense at all. Small script revisions could have given this film a chance but I'm guessing they hoped that anyone who viewed the film had never even visited San Francisco before.",San Andreas
