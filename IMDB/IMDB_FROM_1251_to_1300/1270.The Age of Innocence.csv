0,bkoganbing,Rules and discretion,7,15 February 2021,"The world that Edith Wharton grew up within the 19th century and the one Martin Scorsese did in the 20th century are so vastly different. About all they
have in common is it's New York City. But each has a strict code of behavior and violation can bring ruin and disgrace or worse.In the tight little world of the New York upper crust gossip flows freely, but you
dare not let your life in that new thing called the tabloid press of Mr. Hearst and
Mr. Pulitzer Discretion is the key.Daniel Day Lewis is your typical society blade of the time who is about to make
a good match in Winona Ryder. But he meets up with a cousin of her's Michelle Pheiffer over from Europe. She's married but separated from a profligate scion of old European nobility. Then as now old names marry new money to keep up a lifestyle. It's the bargain you made and by the rules you stick with it.But Pheiffer is an exciting and liberated woman for the time and she fascinates Lewis. The big question is will he ive in to temptation. In Edith Wharton's world you don't.The Age Of Innocence is one opulent film as befits the time and place it's set in.
Winona Ryder got a Best Supporting Actress nomination and it got a flock of
other nominations in technical categories bringing home the statue for Costume Design. It's an eyeful to look at, but Edith Wharton's
story and characters never get lost in the splendor.And it proves a good story is always the bedrock of a good movie.",The Age of Innocence
1,SnoopyStyle,certainly not Scorsese's usual,3,28 December 2014,"It's the 1870's in NYC. Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis) is to be married to the innocent May Welland (Winona Ryder). May's cousin Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) has come to stay. The Countess married poorly to a Polish count who took all of her money. She left him and is the subject of gossip in the proper world. Despite this, May and her family supports her and so does Newland now. The Archers are much more traditional and Newland is expected to marry well for the family. Newland falls for Ellen who decides to divorce her abusive husband. More and more, he finds the naive May to be an empty dress.It seems that Martin Scorsese is more in love with this world and trying to explain it rather than tell a compelling story. The narration plays up the literary background of the material but it is just as stuffy as the world it purports to skewer. Joanne Woodward makes it almost an old fashion MasterPiece Theater. Scorsese is a master filmmaker and this is a beautiful film. The sets are gorgeous. However the narration just droned on and on and on. It is all so boring with every exposition of the various passive aggressiveness.",The Age of Innocence
2,kosmasp,No Innocence detected,8,28 May 2021,"Well that isn't completely true. There is innocence, but there is also a lot of unsaid things! And there is a lot of things that are not shown. So for example while there is no ""sex"" in the movie, it is sizzling with erotic longings and shots. It is a bit of ... maybe not forbidden fruit, but fruit you are not supposed to get or have. Daniel Day Lewis is giving one of the most subtle and understated performances put on film. This is the guy from There will be Blood and Gangs of New York? The latter also a Scorsese movie.A great cast - while I'm not aware of the source material, the movie makes it easy to dive into this bygone era and world, where appearances and gossip played a big role. It is also a world, where women did not have a lot to say. Although even men had issues if they wanted to stay in the upper class. So while you (certainly true for me) have never experienced or know what it is like to look down on others, the movie makes it easy to be in that world and care for many of those people. Especially our three main characters ... who love and hurt themselves at the same time! And all because of looks and appearances and ... society pushing ""guidelines"" on them/everyone ... some are happy to follow them of course.Very complicated matters at times, but themes any viewer can appreciate and get behind. Especially when it comes to the matters of love or being frowned upon, without being guilty of anything really. A period piece that works more than nicely, because of the directing, acting, setting, costume/sound design and cinematography!",The Age of Innocence
3,lee_eisenberg,emotional violence,7,31 March 2015,"New York doyen Martin Scorsese directs another movie set in the city that never sleeps. However, ""The Age of Innocence"" is not about streets that are mean, bulls who rage, or fellas who are good. It focuses on the hypocrisy of 1870s high society. Daniel Day-Lewis's respected lawyer is engaged to Winona Ryder's heiress, but then falls for her cousin (Michelle Pfeiffer).The idea behind the story is that the main character is as trapped by his surroundings as is Travis Bickle in ""Taxi Driver"". There's not an iota of bloodshed in this adaptation of Edith Wharton's novel, but the emotional violence that the characters here perpetrate on each other is analogous to the physical violence in Scorsese's most famous movies. The innocence of the title is as much of a facade as is the lifestyle in ""The Graduate"".Nonetheless, I couldn't watch the movie without throwing out a few ""MST3K""-style comments. For one thing, I kept thinking to myself ""This is directed by the man who gave us 'The Wolf of Wall Street'."" Also, any look at high society tempts me to launch some barbs. I just find it hard to take such a focus seriously. To crown everything, Daniel Day-Lewis's other 1993 movie was ""In the Name of the Father"", which couldn't have been more different from ""The Age of Innocence"".In the end, I recommend the movie. To my knowledge, Martin Scorsese has never made a bad movie. The rest of the cast includes Geraldine Chaplin, Michael Gough, Mary Beth Hurt, Norman Lloyd, Miriam Margolyes, Jonathan Pryce and Joanne Woodward.",The Age of Innocence
4,jboothmillard,The Age of Innocence,7,24 November 2008,"Golden Globe nominated Martin Scorcese (Taxi Driver, GoodFellas, The Departed) directing a period drama, well, call it an arty-farty costume drama, obviously raised many eye-brows, and yet, it worked. Basically, it is the late 19th Century, in America, and Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is engaged to May Welland (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar and BAFTA nominated Winona Ryder), but his life is to be changed when he starts a ""fling"" with May's unconventional cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska (Golden Globe nominated Michelle Pfeiffer). The story obviously focuses on many complications with this love triangle, but it also an interesting insight into the lives of rich folk in those days, e.g. how they dine, how they socialise and where they do they do these things. Also starring Alexis Smith as Louisa Van Der Luyden, Geraldine Chaplin as Mrs. Welland, Mary Beth Hurt as Regina Beaufort, Alec McCowen as Sillerton Jackson, Richard E. Grant as Larry Lefferts, BAFTA winning Miriam Margolyes as Mrs. Mingott, Robert Sean Leonard as Ted Archer, Siân Phillips as Mrs. Archer, Jonathan Pryce as Rivière and Batman's Michael Gough as Henry Van Der Luyden, and narrated by Joanne Woodward. I will admit I wasn't paying full attention to the story, but I could see what the critics mean by some of the acting, especially (Oscar nominated?) Ryder was a bit stiff, but I think this is worth seeing if you want to see Scorsese having some versatility. It won the Oscar for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Music for Elmer Bernstein and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography and Best Production Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Very good!",The Age of Innocence
5,rmax304823,The Very Rich Are Different From the Very Poor.,6,30 July 2017,"Daniel Day-Lewis is Newland Archer, the protagonist of Edith Wharton's novel about love, manners, ethics, money, gossip, and inner turmoil in upper-class 19th-century New York in the 1870s. Day-Lewis recently announced his retirement from acting and it's a damned shame. His Newland Archer is slow-spoken and delicate in his movements. Very polite, you know, kissing hands, attending the opera, and the like. But his Bill ""Butcher"" Cutting was a convincing brutal, coarse murderer in ""Street Gangs of NewYork,"" a rabid and ultimately psychotic capitalist in ""There Will Be Blood,"" and an action hero in ""Last of the Mohawks."" I can't tell if he's particularly handsome or not but his features are plastic enough to fit these varied roles with credibility, as do his performances.The set dressing, the art department, and the production design have outdone themselves in providing period appointments. The screen is filled with evening clothes, hansom cabs, ferns, and piles of flowers -- -- the ""Gilded Age"" for those fortunate enough to have been gilded. It was quite an age. No income tax, entrepreneurs and racketeers rich beyond belief. Diamond Jim Brady lighting his cigars with dollar bills while eleven-year-old kids worked diligently in the coal mines to provide those dollar bills. Director Scorcese amalgamates all these elements into a visual narrative that -- while pretty dull -- is identifiably Scorsese's own. Overhead shots of swarming crowds or significant objects, cross cutting between a decorous love scene in a horse-drawn carriage and high shots of the carriage wheel turning and leaving dirt tracks in the powdery white snow. Day-Lewis in his parlor received some devastating news from his wife, Winona Ryder, and though he shows no excitement, there is a brief cut to a burning log in the fireplace breaking and crumbling with a subdued plop.I said it was ""pretty dull"" and meant it. I could barely keep up with the many characters and the relationship between them, both the obvious ones and those sub rosa. I confess to a few periods of microsleep. Watching all the scenes of opulence made me feel small and broke. Especially one scene at a very long dinner table with overhead shots of the exquisite food the elaborately groomed guests are dining on. I'm sure I would have used the wrong fork. And in an attempt to overcome my nervousness I might have called for more wine and wound up half drunk, with the others all watching me out of the corners of their eyes, far too politic to ever remark about my behavior.I have none of the aplomb of Herb Mankiewicz who was invited to dine with William Randolph Hearst at his elegant mansion. Hearst allowed no alcohol but his girl friend sneaked some to the guests. Herb managed to throw up after the first course but recovered nicely, dabbing at his lips with a white napkin and assuring Hearst, ""Don't worry, Bill, the white wine came up with the fish."" Good luck with the movie. You have never seen so much emotional restraint.",The Age of Innocence
6,moonspinner55,Meticulous to the point of being embalmed...,3,21 February 2008,"Gorgeously-crafted, but otherwise inert and aloof rendering of Edith Wharton's Pulitzer Prize-winning book about a love triangle in New York, circa 1870. Martin Scorsese directed and, though a few of his trademark touches are in evidence, his ultra-restrained atmosphere (while appropriate for the period) proves disenchanting as entertainment, turning his three star leads (Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder) into suffering, swooning waxworks. Scorsese was probably attempting to channel William Wyler and films such as ""The Heiress"", but his take on this story is cold and unenticing, and everything from the dialogue to the melodrama is stilted. An Oscar winner for the costumes--appropriate since the picture is really all style. Story previously filmed in 1934 with Irene Dunne and John Boles. *1/2 from ****",The Age of Innocence
7,Quinoa1984,As Absorbing and magnificent as any other Scorsese film,10,5 March 2001,"Martin Scorsese is definatley one of the greatest directors of the past century and with this work, he proves (along with Kundun) that his verizons span beyond his classics like Mean Streets, Raging Bull and GoodFellas, though those works are some of the best in the American history of film. Here in the Age of Innocence, Scorsese depicts (with the help of Edith Wharton's novel) of a time in New York when things when things were elegant, though also brutal in the deep.  Daniel Day Lewis plays a man who is torn between marrying a woman he likes (Winona Ryder) and making her family happy as well, or choosing a tempting woman with a free mind (Michelle Pfieffer). This could sound like Arthur in the 19th century, but the director handles the material so carefully it works very well along with fine performances and excellent photography by long time collaborator Michael Ballhaus (who also provided my favorite scene in movies in the Cobana long shot in GoodFellas).  One of the best films of 1993.  A+",The Age of Innocence
8,edwagreen,The Age of Innocence is Anything But **,5,20 August 2007,"Very disappointing film depicting upper class society in 1875 New York.The performances are incredibly bad. Michelle Pfeiffer is woefully miscast as the Princess Olenska. Princess? She sounds like she comes from a Brooklyn tenement. She is churlish at best and reminds me of Marilyn Monroe in ""Some Like it Hot.""Equally bad is Winona Ryder in her supporting Oscar nominated performance. She pretends to be as naive as Melanie Hamilton in ""Gone With the Wind,"" when in reality she wasn't.Daniel Day Lewis rises above the mess and gives a fairly decent performance as the lawyer who falls for the cousin of the woman he is engaged to. British actress Miriam Margolyes is appealing as the stroke stricken grandmother to May.(Ryder)The film discusses the disdain for divorce among the upper crust. In reality, these people are nothing more than a bunch of snobs who attend operas and haven't exactly done a hard day's work.Lewis and Pfeiffer puff away on cigarettes. 1875 N.Y., smoking among women? If a woman smoked then, it was done very privately.The first part of the film is utterly boring. The second part is slightly better as the affair can't come to a head.The film really goes down when a period of 25-30 years is glossed over quickly to get the desired effect. The problem is that we get no desire from watching this.In essence, the film is a royal stinker.",The Age of Innocence
9,michaelRokeefe,Some secrets are widely known.,2,15 February 2003,"Martin Scorsese directs this highly acclaimed bore fest. Elaborate costumes and sets, but a story line that offers very little. A high society lawyer(Daniel Day-Lewis)in mid 1800s New York City falls in love with his intended's(Wynona Ryder)cousin(Michelle Pfieffer). A long time to wait for nothing to happen.

10,LeonLouisRicci,Dress And Dining,7,3 February 2014,"Certainly a Change of Pace for Director Martin Scorsese, this is an Effort that is not Completely Successful. Overwhelming in its Depiction of Surface, the Sets, Costumes and Incredible Attention to Detail, the Film's Characters have the Difficult Task of Creating Emotional Attachment when all those Feelings are Suppressed even when it is Convenient to do Otherwise.The Best Scenes are when Newton Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis slightly miscast) Defends Ellen (Michelle Pfeiffer completely miscast). It is here that the Smoldering Fire Sparks a Display of Compassion and Passion where the Movie comes Alive. Also, the Granny Scenes Occasionally Liven Up the Deadly Boring Proceedings because there a Glimpse of Humanity is shown where there Simply is none Existent Elsewhere.These People do Exist in a Completely Non-Expressive Cover of Dress and Dining of the most Elegant and it is these Artificial Environs that are the Real Stars in this Exquisite Exercise in Elegance. Gorgeous to Look at, it is the Characters and the Screenplay that make this a Vacant Victorian Story that is not so Appealing. The Film has the Inenviable Task of making Watchable a Virtually Uninteresting, at least on the Surface, Parade of People that Deserve Little Attention.So the Point is Made and it is not Very Dramatic because there is just no There There and Scorsese takes Another Point of View. That of the Camera.",The Age of Innocence
11,writers_reign,Guilt On The Gingerbread,6,17 September 2007,"This is Scorcese anxious to prove he can do more than make movies about sub-humans like de Niro and Pesci competing to see who can say the f-word the most times in between killing and maiming other animals like themselves and on that level it more or less succeeds. Somewhere along the way he's clearly seen a Max Ophuls movie so we get lots of shots with the camera circling the action and making elegant swoops and fluid movements. Not bad as far as it goes, too bad Ophuls did it first. Joanne Woodward's voice-over narration hits the right note for Edith Wharton which is not always replicated by the actors. There's absolutely no chemistry between the two leads, Daniel Day-Lewis and Michelles Pfeiffer though Pfeiffer scores as someone who might easily captivate a man even as uptight as Day-Lewis. There are lots of stunning visuals all out of the right bottle and the pace is more or less right but ultimately it's shadow at the expense of substance.",The Age of Innocence

THIS is the way to do a literary adaptation.Martin Scorsese, never one to fear boldness, tackles Edith Wharton's classic and revels in its sumptuous excess. The production and costume design alone are worth the price of admission, but Scorsese does Wharton's themes and characterizations justice as well.That most chameleonic of chameleon actors Daniel Day-Lewis is perhaps a bit too old for his role, but Day-Lewis can do anything and he's great here. Michelle Pfeiffer's natural coldness as an actress serves her well in this particular role.

15,JamesHitchcock,The Social Insider,8,16 August 2012,"In the early nineties Martin Scorsese's reputation was largely that of a maker of tough, gritty and violent films about the underworld or modern-day urban street life, often with a maladjusted, anti-social loner at their heart. He had, admittedly, made occasional films on other subjects, notably ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", but even so he was not the most likely candidate to direct an adaptation, in best Merchant-Ivory ""heritage cinema"" style, of a novel by Edith Wharton. ""The Age of Innocence"" was to reveal him as a more versatile director than many had hitherto realised. ""Heritage cinema"" is often regarded as something uniquely British, although this is a misconception; there are, for example, a number of fine French examples. A number of Americans have played a part in the development of the genre in Britain; James Ivory is American by birth, as was Joseph Losey who directed one of the earliest examples of the style, ""The Go-Between"". ""The House of Mirth"" (also based on a Wharton novel) is a film in this style on an American subject, but made in Britain by a British director, Terence Davis. ""The Age of Innocence"", by contrast, is a piece of genuinely American heritage cinema, although several of the cast are British or Irish. The story is set among the affluent classes of 1870s New York. Newland Archer is a lawyer engaged to be married to the beautiful young socialite May Welland but who finds himself attracted to May's cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska. Ellen is something of a controversial figure in New York's high society. She is separated from her abusive and unfaithful husband, a Polish count. Worse still, rumour has it that she herself has had an adulterous affair with her husband's (male) secretary. Newland first meets Ellen when she consults his firm about a possible divorce, although she eventually decides not to go through with it in order to spare her family further scandal. (Although American law at this period permitted divorce, American high society strongly disapproved of it). As their friendship deepens into love, Newland has to decide whether to follow the desires of his heart or the expectations of society. When I first saw this film in the cinema, back in 1993, I remember thinking that Newland must be mad if he could contemplate leaving the lovely Winona Ryder, with her fragile, haunting beauty, even for someone as undoubtedly attractive as Michelle Pfeiffer. I must say that my wife is still of that opinion, but having seen the film again recently I began to understand his feelings more. Ryder's May, for all her loveliness, is someone who comes across as shallow, conventional and slightly dull. Pfeiffer's Ellen, by contrast, is a woman of greater maturity, experience and worldly wisdom. Her air of exoticism and sophistication might make her suspect in the eyes of society, but it is precisely these characteristics which make her so fascinating to Newland. Newland is not what I have come to think of as a typical Daniel Day-Lewis character. Perhaps there is no such thing as a ""typical Day-Lewis character"", but the roles I most associate him with are those where he has to play individuals who are angry, outspoken or in some respect social outsiders. In some cases these figures are excluded from society by causes beyond their control, such as Christy Brown in ""My Left Foot"", excluded by his disabilities, or Gerry Conlan in ""In the Name of the Father"", excluded by an unjust conviction for a crime he did not commit, or Hawkeye in ""The Last of the Mohicans"", who feels more at home in Indian society than in the white society to which he belongs by birth. In other cases, however, he plays characters who can be considered anti-social personalities, such as Bill the Butcher in ""Gangs of New York"" (also made by Scorsese) and Plainview in ""There Will Be Blood"". In this film, however, Day-Lewis shows his versatility by playing a man who is very much a social insider, one who is fascinated by social outsiders like Ellen but who fears becoming an outsider himself. There is, in fact, some very subtle acting from all three of the leads. Pfeiffer also showed her versatility; her two previous roles before this one, Catwoman in ""Batman"" and the blue-collar housewife Lurene in ""Love Field"" had been about as different from Countess Olenska as one could imagine, although she had earlier played another period-drama heroine in ""Dangerous Liaisons"". The film's only acting Oscar nomination, however, went to Ryder for ""Best Supporting Actress"", which I felt was appropriate. Although May is the quietest of the three main characters, she is very much at the heart of the drama. (The ""innocence"" of the novel's title surely refers to her). As the film develops we realise that she might, in fact, be less naive and superficial, and more strong and determined, than she initially seems, making her a surprisingly complex character, and all these complexities are inherent in Ryder's performance. Another good performance in a supporting role comes from Miriam Margolyes as May's formidable grandmother Mrs. MingottThe film is visually sumptuous with strong, bright colours, especially reds, pinks, yellows and greens, much in evidence. Again, these are qualities one would not automatically associate with Scorsese's earlier works, which were often visually dark. (""Raging Bull"", for example, was largely shot in black-and-white). Since 1993, however, these qualities have been seen in some of his later works, especially his other period dramas ""Gangs of New York"" and ""The Aviator"". ""The Age of Innocence"" can be seen as a fine example of Scorsese's skills as a film-maker. It is not entirely typical of his work- there is less physical action than in many of his films- but it perhaps seems less untypical today than it did in 1993. 8/10",The Age of Innocence
16,=G=,Not so much a wonderful story as a wonderful telling.,8,15 February 2001,"""The Age of Innocence"" takes the audience into the pages of 19th century New York's social register as it follows one eligible blue blood, Day-Lewis, and his love interests (Pfeiffer & Ryder). The film, which boasts many awards including several Oscars, is a 2+ hour long tale of the this and that of the upper crust's elite replete with lavish sets, elegant costuming, and a narration which is required to explain the film's esoterics. The fun of ""Age..."" is not so much in the story as it is in the telling. A feast for those interested in period flicks and the social innerworkings of high society.",The Age of Innocence
17,DKosty123,1920 Edith Wharton Novel Brought To Life,7,11 November 2017,"The Pulitzer Prize was awarded to this novel. This film is magnificently brought to the screen giving it full color and a great cast. Granted, the Author is long gone, and the prize was long ago, but the script adaptation is solid giving life to America prior to 1920. Filming for this was done in Philadelphia, Pa, Troy, NY, the Bronx, and Paris, France among other locations. The locations are all treated well. Daniel Day-Lewis heads a major cast and has the dilemma of Michelle Pfeiffer versus Winona Ryder who in real life is 13 years her junior. In all these period costumes, they both look magnificent. The period of refinement and elegance fits all of them well.This is a drama and as such could tend to bore many viewers, but those who appreciate drama and acting will enjoy this one. Geraldine Chaplin is particularly effective in this movie too. It is mostly the story of Newland Archer becoming engaged and married to a beautiful young woman while falling in love with a Countess who has recently been widowed but will not allow herself to consummate a love she has for him too. The ending of this is very symbolic of the whole story of the real love that is but yet never realized. It is one of quiet rejection.",The Age of Innocence
18,lasttimeisaw,a gem of literary adaption inlaid with sumptuous artifice,8,30 June 2017,"Opulence and emotional restraint might not be maestro Scorsese's strongest suit, yet the oddity of THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, a Gilded Age torrid but never consummated love affair setting against a silk stocking New York's high society, gallantly taps into a rarefied sphere of patrician hindrances and underhanded intrigues, all presented with gorgeous, even florid mise-en-scène (courtesy of art director Dante Ferretti, marks his first collaboration with Marty) accentuating the paradoxical combat between one's self-purported conscience and those intangible extrinsic forces. The time is around 1870, Newland Archer (Day-Lewis) and May Welland (Ryder) are ostensibly the perfect specimen of an upper crust betrothal of gilded youth, but the unheralded advent of Countess Ellen Olenska (Pfeiffer), May's cousin, purveyed as the latest fodder for those snotty scandalmongers, because of her flubbed marriage, stirs Newland's even-tempered facade. Newland has carried a torch for Ellen ever since his childhood, and by announcing his engagement to May, they are practically in the same family. Ellen's less guarded and more bluff carriage and outlook differentiates herself from the rest petticoat mindset and instantly tickles Newland to an immense degree. Unbeknownst to her, he pulls his back into sweeten the pill of her disgraced comeback with earnest succor, and tries to make the issue as less uglier as possible both for her and their family's sake. You see, Newland is a self-claimed nobleman, considers himself head and shoulders above those priggish snobs around him, but he is not hot to trot to challenge the status quo, at any rate, it is where he belongs, wallowing in luxury must have its adversities, toward which he can put on a disdainful face to feel superior. But, in the case of Ellen, he balks at his action because he caves in for his innate weakness which will put three people in the misery, that weakness is bred from a misconstrued illusion, as Ellen pinpoints at one stage: we all prone to do something which is convenient for us but not essentially what we want. They might have a happy ending at hand if Newland can right the wrong when he stills have time to spare, and there is nothing for Ellen to do under that specific circumstance when woman liberation is merely a tall tale. Albeit the film's ornate frippery, the leitmotif is rather simple, a love triangle at its center, May loves Newland wholeheartedly but also selfishly, she represents those who will do anything to maintain a flawless veneer of their matrimony and takes with pride as their biggest victory and life-long vocation where true love doesn't matter at all, is it pathetic? On paper, yes, but in reality, it has its remedial effect one may find it hard to disabuse. Ryder becomes the sole recipient of an Oscar nomination among the cast (although kudos should also be duly given to Margolyes' scrumptious turn as the immobile matriarch, droll at first glance, but evinces great compassion when she is given something meaty to chew on), and it is a subtle, insidiously calculated achievement, she seems to be the girl every man dreams of marrying, but only the one who gets her knows the distaste, one cannot say she is soulless, she might be someone else's perfect match (fat chance though). But she knows all too well what she wants, to an extent that she can paper over all those visible interstices instead of relinquishing someone who doesn't love her back. Now, the third composite of the triangle, Ellen is a faded beauty, a tender soul, sometimes even too naive under those unfriendly surroundings, which Ms. Pfeiffer makes such an indelible presence here, her vulnerability is manifest, lugubrious, her Ellen is eternally bedeviled by loneliness, which makes Newland a bright beacon among the murkiness of her futurity, but she has no wiles, her only compromise is when she acquiesce to Newland's paramour offer, which ultimately is scuttled, there is no alternative for her but to retreat to where she comes from, she is the typical damsel-in- distress but her knight-in-shining-armor is bogged down in his own inaction and qualms. This tragic tenor is what makes the film tick, and thanks to a minutely arranged coordination from its hardware department, the film triumphs that aim in spite of that 25-years-later coda comes off as saccharine to a fault, talking about poetic license. An untypical Scorsesean offering, but built on an immaculate caliber (to say nothing of Ms. Woodward's entrancing and soothing voice-over), THE AGE OF INNOCENCE is not a cheesy weepie even if sometimes it perilously runs to, in the main, it sheds more light on human foibles than we often give credits to those of its ilk, a gem of literary adaption inlaid with sumptuous artifice, perforce, that is a winning formula beckons appreciation.",The Age of Innocence
19,ElMaruecan82,"And here begins ""The Age of Innocence"" : Marty's epic and tormented Romance ...",10,30 December 2010,"From the bold and shadowy streets of New-York, where the slang is punctuated every minute with so many F and S bombs, Martin Scorsese plunges us in ""The Age of innocence"" into a totally different world, not so far from his earlier works's settings, but so far in time that it seems to belong to an era that never existed. In this brilliant, elegantly directed film, we discover New-York's Aristocracy of the 1870's. A world of distinction, elegance, refinement, a world where every single word should be carefully weighted before being submitted to the gossips ... a world where silence is a dangerous weapon, a world where beyond the splendor, reigns a stink maybe worst than in the sleaziest street in the town. Yes, if the beautiful cinematography reminds you of Kubrick, Bergman, Forman or Visconti, the themes of the film remain purely Scorsesian.A young lawyer, named Newland Archer, seems to be the perfect man, or husband to fit into this environment: he's handsome, elegant and distinguished. But by one cruel irony of fate, he's also an idealist with a tendency of being seduced by anti-conformist spirits, and it gets worse when this spirit inhabits the beautiful body and charming personality of the countess Ellen Olenska, played by a magnificent Michelle Pfeiffer, and its even worse when this man is already engaged to the innocent and angelic May, played in a scene-stealing role by the delicious Winona Ryder. And the man is no one but Daniel-Day Lewis in a tailor-made role played in all nuance. But let's not reduce this masterpiece to a banal triangular love story.Martin Scorsese proves again that when it comes to portray the torment of guilt and regret, no director comes to this level of brilliance. Here is a man who is torn between his passion and his true faithful love to the girl he promised to marry, so sweet and devoted she's like a reminiscence of Olivia De Havilland in ""Gone With the Wind"". His passion is incarnated by Ellen, an unhappy woman suffering from the griefs of a bad marriage, worsened by the condescending gossips of a society that is high by the name and low by the thoughts. This woman, ironically, seems to carry more joy and free-spiritedness than any other person Archer encountered in his life. Basically, this would be such an easier deal if he wasn't engaged and her not married but life can't be arranged like marriages, even implicitly.Still, Archer believes in freedom, in a sort of equality of rights between men and women in the satisfaction of desires, couldn't he be wrong? Is there really two kind of women, the Kays and the Ellens, .. what makes the movie even more satisfying is its realistic approach, at many points, you don't exactly know which side Archer's feelings lean to. What makes its approach even more realistic is the depth that the script and Marty's masterful directing bring to the characters. Ellen has a sense of duty and a maturity that prevents her from being labeled as the typical frivolous woman who puts her claws on the good husband. Michelle is no cat-woman here. May's character is far from being the naive cheated wife, she knows exactly what it is all about.And of course, you have the heart of your film, Daniel Day Lewis, a fascinating character, so typically Scorsesian. A man who makes choices only to face immediate regrets, who seems so sure about his feelings, but from whom the lightest breeze of passion makes the whole tower of confidence literally collapse. Passion is everything that leads our acts, and guide them until we realize that reason must prevail, and in this cruelly ironic world, the reason, incarnated by the duty, is guided by society, by friends, by family. One of the most intelligent and insightful quotes I've ever listened to is ""How can we be happy behind the backs of people who trust us?"" That very quote rang true in my heart.People we love are our most dangerous dream killers, because they are in our hearts but they don't penetrate our soul enough to guess our feelings, our dreams, our motives. Yet, when we live in a world where convenience must predominate our acts, when an appearance of happiness is more important than happiness itself, when values rely on signs more than meanings, and any disobedience is like a piece of meat abandoned in a forest full of starving wolves, what is to expect from two passioned hearts who only want to be alone together instead of being together but alone? Archer indeed appears like a lonely character, floating in a world, in an etiquette, he doesn't belong to, so is Ellen. So they took the wisest decision, it didn't extinguish the passion, but at least, it was just more convenient. Duty has the merit of calming passion in a way we can try to reach happiness without touching it, instead of touching it many times and being swept away from it. To avoid the pain of a repetitive loss, better to lose once for all.No time to regret, no time to feel guilt, not in the Scorsesian era of ""Goodfellas"" or ""Mean Streets"" where every word is said straight-forwardly, where every hit leads to bloodshed, and any fight can lead to death. The world of Archer is too insincere, too codified for that, the best way to conjure the doom is to react with the same weapon, a serene but calculated resignation. Deliberately choosing unhappiness might be the best way to keep happy. Scorsese teaches us how you can get rid of guilt and regret when you anticipate how things can go worse. Wisdom of resignation, interesting ... When stops the guilt, begins ""The Age of Innocence"".",The Age of Innocence
20,gbill-74877,"Issues with pace, but true to the novel and a brilliant ending",8,11 September 2017,"You may have to shrug off your disdain for films about the upper crust of society to watch this one. If you can do that, and if you can patiently allow the story to unfold, you will be rewarded. Director Martin Scorsese is true to Wharton's brilliant novel, and was painstaking in his attention to all of the little details of the time period. The narration by Joanne Woodward is excellent. The forbidden love Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) has for Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) while being engaged to May Welland (Winona Ryder) grows ever so gradually, until it becomes a raging fire. At the same time, there is great restraint here, accurate to the morals of the day, but leaving one with a much deeper feeling of the angst involved as a result. The little signals each person in this love triangle send to one another often have great subtlety, yet it feels just as powerful as if they were yelling or screaming.I confess I didn't think any of the three principal actors delivered a great performance – Day-Lewis is a little too morose, Pfeiffer lacks that teeny touch of wickedness, and Ryder's acting is the most suspect, despite her Oscar nomination. The chemistry between Day-Lewis and Pfeiffer does not seem authentic, but with all of that said, each of them is reasonably good. I think Scorsese was dead on with the tone and this is clearly a labor of love, but I don't think the story needed 139 minutes, and there are some issues with pace (which compound the understated action). On the other hand, he gives us some truly wonderful moments, all leading to an ending that is absolutely brilliant, which, just as with the novel, left me with goosebumps.",The Age of Innocence
21,Irishchatter,Yawn.....,1,21 December 2015,"I was shocked that this movie was absolutely boring and dull because well known actors such as Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder were involved in this. I honestly thought this was gonna be a unique movie from the very start but it just didn't give me that vibe to let me know that the movie would be enjoyable to watch!I just don't think this movie should've been awarded an Oscar and other nominations. It would be probably better to have added in more main characters since three really didn't seem to be enough for the movie..I definitely consider this not a good movie to watch, it would most likely waste your time!",The Age of Innocence
22,inkblot11,"Agelessly beautiful, based on a superb Edith Wharton novel",10,4 March 2007,"Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis) is the son of a wealthy family. A lawyer, he thinks he has found his future and perfect wife in May (Winona Ryder). Much to his dismay, May wants a longer engagement. However, as his wedding nears, Newland is introduced to May's cousin, Ellen (Michelle Pfeiffer). Ellen married a European count but, after an abusive relationship, scandalized society by returning to New York and requesting a divorce. Newland is surprised and enchanted by Ellen's company, in part because she speaks her mind, with charm. After his marriage to May, Newland is still an active participant in Ellen's life, not only because she is family but because of her legal troubles. Unexpectedly, Newland's admiration for Ellen, and vice versa, grows deeper each day. In a restrictive society, what does one do with feelings that can never be expressed? This film, based on the great novel by Wharton, is beauty intacto. The story is set in turn of the century New York and concerns the very rich, so sets and costumes are very lovely. Beyond that, the tale is a representation of the restrictive, Victorian society where the least hint of scandal or impropriety could heap dire consequences on the individuals involved. As the players in an unexpected love triangle, Day-Lewis, Ryder, and Pfeiffer are superbly touching and genuine. Scorcese's direction is faultless and so is the movie's narration, performed by Joanne Woodward. Do you want a movie experience that will overwhelm you with beauty and pathos?

Using sumptuous sets and beautiful cinematography, Scorsese does a superb job of evoking a bygone era where society had a great effect on one's personal decisions. Bernstein adds a fine score. Lewis is excellent as a lawyer engaged to a simple young woman but in love with his fiancé's worldly cousin. Pfeiffer is enchanting as the object of Lewis's desire. The narration (by Joanne Woodward), taken directly from the book, is a bit overwhelming during the expository scenes, but adds to the experience as the film settles down.",The Age of Innocence
24,sol-,My brief review of the film,9,11 May 2005,"This is Martin Scorsese's most beautiful film and possibly his very finest film. It is a delight to look at, with apt and colourful costumes and sets, and some very elegant work by the cinematographer and editor. The film consists of many different shots from many different camera angles, and they are edited swiftly together. Michael Ballhaus has handsomely photographed the film, with wonderful gliding takes, use of over-exposure to change scenes, and some artificial spotlights to highlight the important details in certain frames. The pacing is slow, but not in a negative way, as it gives one time to be drawn into the film and the depicted period. The third person narration from Joanne Woodward does however make it slightly restrained, as it is impersonal and sets emotion aside from the action on screen. The acting is also a tad ordinary from most performers, but besides for these two points there is little to complain about here. The film is great to look at, and it has some things to say about the society that it is depicting too, making it really quite an enjoyable experience.",The Age of Innocence
25,Rodrigo_Amaro,A different Scorsese experience (brilliant as usual),9,2 April 2020,"A costume romance/drama period piece directed by Martin Scorsese seems unusual when attach the director's name to the project based on Edith Wharton's novel.
Indeed, ""The Age of Innocence"" is the least Scorsese film he ever made though it contains a regular motif from his previous works which is violence. One may wonder
how is it possible to assemble this film with masterpieces as ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Goodfellas"", all pictures with twisted violence, murders and such? Well, the
story presented here speaks volumes on the issue since it talks about a different kind of violence, one that is very harmful and just as powerful as a gunshot
wound - the social killing of personal individuals living in a world of brutal social conventions that can only accept those who follow a certain moral order and
slowly and indirectly kills those who don't live by the rules of coexisting in an environment where the exteriors are always more valuable and important than the
true emotions one must keep hidden in order to survive. The 1870's New York of the film is an apparently gorgeous, ellegant world inhabited by a high class group
whose hypocrisy and false morality are a natural law that tends to shut down human beings with unconventional personalities, making of them cast outs that musn't be
included in this large group of purists. The exuberant and pleasing aesthetics reinforced by high moral standards equals a world of vanity, impurity, lack of
decency and humanity; and when it comes to remove the unpleasant elements of their own group they'll always kill them softly.In that world, there are a man and a woman who face obstacles, break the rules and have a love relationship that truly evokes more than passion, more than
romance: it's a story about mutual understanding and respect. Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) and Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) make a sort of revolutionary
individuals who try not to play by the rules because life is more important and interesting that what meets the eye, not to mention the society rules imposed don't work
(guess we can say about today's standards as well, not just for the wealthy but also for the less fortunte ones as well). Or in some cases, rules don't apply and you gotta
make your own path, make your own judgments and live by what you consider your ethics, your morals, your values. Olenska is viewed as a plague to be avoided due
to her status of being a woman alone living in America while her husband, a Count, stayed back in Europe. Her cousin, May (Winona Ryder) is a young girl deeply
immersed in that world of rules and manners who happens to be engaged with Archer, who is deeply fond of her though from the moment he meets the Countess he seems
impressed by the woman. It's not what he sees, it's what he perceives and comprehends of her being that is important - she's completely alone in that place and he feels
for her - not a case of pity since she doesn't seem to mind what goes on around her from whispers, gossips and turn down invitations to the most important social
events of the moment; but on the other hand it's not a case that she simply challenges the society face to face. She just shows who she really is, a free woman who in
spite of the place and its norms, she feels better there than with her cheating husband of whom divorce is unthinkable, not to mention even if she got it then she would
bring disgrace to her cousin May, to Archer and both families. But their mutual admiration transcends everything, love grows but...he's destined to marry May - he loves
her, or perhaps that sense she's quite innocent to his eyes, she's unlike all the old folks around her though she obeys gracefully.""The Age of Innocence"" is a beautiful, intricate and relevant film filled with extreme and nuanced layers of deep complexity that only a skillfulled artist like
Scorsese could turn into an unusual experience that on the hands of another director could turn into a melodramatic mash filled to please audiences, allienating them with a
more conventional period piece that most of the times tends to bore more intellectual audiences. The experience of watching ""The Age of Innocence"" can only be truly
appreciated by Scorsese's biggest fans because they'll understand the techniques employed from the visual to the storytelling (co-written by Jay Cocks, who gave him the
novel back in 1980). Thelma Schoonmaker's editing alligned with the outstanding cinematography by Michael Ballhaus makes of this a film that is totally out of the square
format similar films presents to us (at times, it feels a bit too strange to see images that fade to a different color when certain emotions and reaction are evoked; or
the theatre sequence where the binoculars of a character fastily observes the people in the crowd or the handwritting letters that blocks the view of a shot).
Another point of brilliance was adding a narration by the sweet voice of Joanne Woodward, almost as if reading the book while the images are on screen - it's a
great use of narration because it's not that kind of voice-over that explains to the viewer what's he seeing, it's more like an observation and presentation of some of
the many supporting characters and their importance in that society; and Marty doesn't abuse of much voice-over as he did in ""GoodFellas"" or ""Casino"". It's a different style
attached to it. And as I stated in the beginning, the director's intentions go beyond the love story, it's a study on violence, behavior and the invisible kicks and punches
that life can give us at any given time - there were times when I felt more disturbed in hearing the things said about Olenska's past than in hearing the usual F-bombs thrown
like a wildfire in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"".There's something about this movie that keeps bringing me back, and I guess to lots of viewers as well - and with Scorsese it's hard to say we can get satisfied with just
one view (this one got subsequent views over the years because I wasn't impressed with it the first time I saw it). Surely, the detailed and flawless art-direction, the careful costume design
by Gabriella Pescucci were key factors that are a feast for us but the film is a lot more than that once you go deeper into the heart and soul of the film, which is extremely present in the
exquisite performances by Day-Lewis, Pfeiffer and Ryder. They may look stiff, too reserved or just too manipultive to themselves due to the conflicted characters they play, but the more you
watch them the more you notice little details that make them look huge forces of nature, and you truly understand why Scorsese cast those actors in such roles.
On a random (but not that much) note, I'm grateful for its existence because with it we wouldn't have ""Gangs of New York"" (Scorsese/Day-Lewis/Jay Cocks partnership)
nor ""There Will Be Blood"" (check out the film trivia related with both films, DDL and Dillon Freasier's casting in P.T. Anderson's movie).With ""The Age of Innocence"", Mr. Scorsese has made a unique film in his stellar career, reflecting life as it is - painfully ordinary when surrounded with dull conventions
and established rules that fail to be coherent; but also beautiful, romantic, valuable and way beyond from what the mind can conceive and the eyes can see. It has to be felt too. 9/10",The Age of Innocence
26,filipemanuelneto,"Grand, opulent, truly rigorous in the way it portrays the behavior and social conventions of the time, but without much story to tell.",7,24 June 2020,"Making period films is a challenge for any director, as historical rigour is something truly important and difficult to achieve. So difficult that many films choose to relativize its importance and make films that more easily portray the way we, in the 21st century, see the past, than the past itself. However, Scorcese was able to give us a film that overcomes this difficulty.The story of this film is so trivial that it can be disappointing: at the end of the 19th century, the New York elite lives closed in its own world, stuck to its social conventions, copied from the Old World, and when it happens something that goes against rules, ostracism is guaranteed. Its in this environment that lives Newland Archer, who is engaged to the young and pure May Welland. All seems to be perfect but the arrival of Countess Ellen Olenska, who returns from Europe in order to escape a bad marriage, promises to endanger this plans, as she was the Newland's youth love and seems to give little importance to social conventions.I think I understand why this film is now forgotten. Its a warm film, as the script simply tells a banal story of a period love triangle, full of comings and goings, exchanges of letters and repressed emotions. And its presumptuous because it gives itself a lot of importance and an air of dramatic super-production without having a script that justifies it. The problem is not the emotional restraint of the characters. This is something to be expected in a film set in the 19th century elite, for whom emotions were things that should not exist in public. The problem is that, besides making a good portrait of the behavior and mentality of that period, it has nothing else to give to the public. There is no story, there is no plot and the film is not able to compensate for that.The cast has some strong names, starting with Daniel Day-Lewis, a real chameleon. He perfectly embodied his character, a well-born and educated man who knows his place and what is expected of him. The actor was excellent in the task of showing the mental confusion of his character when his feelings tried to counter the well-directed course he wanted to take in his life. Winona Ryder is perfect in the role of a young naive woman, raised inside a crystal dome but with a generous heart and a noble soul, in sharp contrast to the almost disruptive character of Michelle Pfeiffer. She is the elegant seductive woman, with a dubious and controversial past, who breaks through the city and behaves freely, shocking the conservative and who ends up discovering that America is no longer free or open-minded that the European countries from which she had decided to leave.Technically, the film is extraordinary. Scorcese's style is there but discreet, as subtle as the emotions shown by the characters. Slowly and leisurely, the film drags on, as it moves from the theater to the ballroom and the elegant garden. Joanne Woodward's slightly monochordic deep voice doesn't help and makes it even heavier. Visually, its an opulent, grandiose film, with meticulously made sets and detailed props, in addition to having the best 19th century costumes I have ever seen in a feature film. Everything breathes ostentation, and earned this film an well-deserved Oscar for Best Costume Design.But it is undoubtedly a numbing film, able to put to sleep the audience that are less sensitive to historical rigour. Our current mentality didn't like to restraining emotions, but it was the 19th century way of thinking and the film does nothing more than show it and be good at it. It is a pity that the plot is not so good, by giving us a truly engaging or moving story. Without this, the film resembles a gift box, brilliantly wrapped and with a large, showy bow on top, but with only a cheap present inside.",The Age of Innocence
27,jzappa,The Contagious Cruelty of Aristocracy,10,23 October 2006,"The Age of Innocence, titled ironically with aggressive sarcasm, feels so foreign it could be sheer fantasy. A severe social code controls how people speak, move, meet, separate, eat dinner, earn their income, fall in love, marry. Not a word of the code is recorded anywhere, which is why it serves inescapably as the psychology of everyone's behavior. And they've been learning it since they were born.In the stylish environment of the eldest, wealthiest families in 1870s NYC, marriages are like pacts between land-owners, their intentions not just to bond romance or procreate, but to support the systematic spread of affluence. Anything that jeopardizes this unflappable practice is despised. It's not thought suitable for people to put their own self-seeking wishes above the self-seeking requirements of their self-seeking class. Some do certainly ""marry for love,"" but the custom is condemned as bad-mannered and precarious.Newland Archer is engaged to marry the attractive young May Welland. He has great fondness for her, though she doesn't seem terribly bright, obedient rather than lively. All concur this is a good marriage between good families. But one night at the opera he sees a cousin, Ellen, the Countess Olenska, who's been married in Europe for years. She, he's astounded to find, looks on his world with the aloofness of an outcast. She's stunning, but what thrills Archer is the presence of a woman who valiantly thinks for herself.She's not highly regarded. First she made the misstep of marrying a outside her circle and living in Europe. Then she made a bigger boo-boo returning after splitting from her husband, where she sticks out as an unusual woman whom no one entirely knows what to do with. It's plain to everyone that her company's a danger to the tidy development of Archer's marriage.This breed of story would appear to be of little relevance to Scorsese, a director of immense guilty consciences and vigorous violence. But indeed this story's anguished, forceful, the chronicle of a man's obsession trampled, his spirit conquered. And it goes further. The last scene is heartrending because it divulges that Newland wasn't the only one with feelings, that others sacrificed for him, that his deepest misfortune wasn't what he lost, but what he never recognized he had.These prosperous nobles move in their golden circles from opera to banquet to lounge, a uniform for every function, every time of day. Scorsese inundates us with the largest and smallest social details, the tilts of heads, positions of fleeting looks, understated intonations. He captures the heart of each moment. He stops and slows time. He changes space. He creates moods. And slowly we grasp what's occurring: Archer's contemplating breaking his engagement to May so as to elope with Ellen. Everyone's concerned to thwart him, while at no time does anyone betray by the least indication that they know what they're doing.Scorsese channels his headlong temperament into an unquenchably comprehensive, multifaceted formality. So much applause has deservedly been given to the extraordinary Copacabana tracking shot in GoodFellas, the aftermath in Taxi Driver, the march to the ring in Raging Bull. Yet none of them require the level of perspective intricacy, swarming hustle-bustle, ornament and elaborately planned movement as a handful of extensive tracking shots here, particularly the first of them. He lusts over full-course meals, sees through roving opera glasses, captures the weather and architectural gravel of 1870 New York. There's a gorgeous Saul Bass opening title sequence.We're supplied with Joanne Woodward's narration, comprehending all that's transpiring, furnishing the concealed thoughts of the characters. We gather the rules of the upper crust. We meet the old Mrs. Mingott, who has enormous amounts of money and acts for her society as more or less an appeals court of what can and can't be acceptable. And we see the boundless sensitivity and consideration with which May preserves her relationship with Archer. May realizes or conjectures everything that materializes between him and Ellen, but she decides to accept only some information, and works with unforeseen cunning to protect her marriage while never totally seeming to detect anything.Each performance is tempered to maintain the diplomatic equilibrium of the warfare. Day-Lewis endures at the core, misled for a time that he has independence. Pfeiffer, as the countess, is a woman who sees through society without totally denying it, taking a nearly sensuous delight in seducing Archer with the strength of her mind. Initially it seems that May's an ignorant looker-on and casualty, but Ryder slowly uncovers her astuteness. If you notice, none of the actors are concentrated on themselves. Their inflections, facial expressions come entirely from their interest in the responses of the other. Scorsese's romantic leads don't have to sleep together. They don't even have to like each other all the time. As long as they listen. The texture, gist, wit, tension are all enriched by every performance. I've seen love scenes wherein nude bodies lash in slippery, big-breasted fervor, but I've seldom seen them more zealous than in this movie, where everyone's enveloped in covers of Victorian tyranny. The major erotic flashes happen in public among completely clad people speaking in flawlessly tempered expressions, so crammed with libido and dread. Story's put ahead of showy individual performances.The Age of Innocence seems to characterize a world utterly unfamiliar to us. But Edith Wharton appreciated that the people of her story had the same hungers as we barbaric moderns. Not acting on them made them all the more resilient. By the end, we've found they have all the same sentiments, enthusiasms, doubts, and needs that we do. It's just that they treasure them differently. They're less casual with them, and don't choose a moment's excess over an existence's acute romantic sorrow.",The Age of Innocence
28,mjneu59,"Martin Scorsese, out of his element",3,2 November 2010,"Martin Scorsese was the wrong choice to direct this exercise in period manners, starring Michelle Pfeiffer as a merry widow risking high society scandal by romancing married gentleman Daniel Day-Lewis. In a misguided attempt to enliven a notoriously static genre, Scorsese and crew all but bury Edith Wharton's historical costume drama under an avalanche of distracting camera-work and pretentious effects: iris lighting; non-stop dolly shots; dizzy panning; fisheye lenses; and so forth. The result is a Masterpiece Theatre presentation for MTV audiences, an anachronistic combination of polite Victorian drama and up-to-the-minute visual kinetics, intended no doubt as an actor's showcase (with Winona Ryder?) but in fact ignoring the otherwise talented cast to highlight, instead, only the cosmetic gloss. The film could have been a minor classic in the Merchant-Ivory mold (it's a pity they didn't make it first), but the script is too often pressed into service as a surrogate camera, with redundant, unidentified voice-over narration by Joanne Woodward describing in numbing detail every element of the expensive production design: food, furnishings, costumes, cigars, and so forth.

Daniel Day-Lewis and the cast do a great job of just letting this story unfold before our eyes. Nothing is overdone and everything happens in a matter of fact way that seems to mesh with the times in late 1800 New York City(where this movie is set). The story is about a couple of the brink of their engagement where the marriage will link together two powerful families in the area, but arriving on the scene from overseas is a countess who has been left alone by her husband as she attempts a divorce in the U.S.(where it's legal but looked down upon). The Daniel Day-Lewis character befriends the countess played by Michelle Pfeiffer, excellently, and starts to become attracted to her. This starts a battle within him as to what should be, compared to what he wants, that spans throughout the rest of the movie. Martin Scorsese does a great job of making the focus the story in this adaptation of a novel and keeps your interest throughout. There is an underlying theme of never allowing the negative to be seen or spoken of in this culture but rather shown in the families acts. This is portrayed in ""who"" they invite to parties and for what occasions they have parties. It's all a very behind the scenes manipulative process of controlling their world and is done by whole groups of people in an almost natural and scary way. This theme plays out in the conclusion in a very negative way as we see that it is very difficult in this setting for people to have their real dreams fulfilled because everything is played out for them, making for an internal prison. Again, this is all portrayed excellently in this very under-stated and un-heralded masterpiece from a brilliant filmmaker.",The Age of Innocence

32,Steffi_P,"""A set of arbitrary signs""",4,6 January 2012,"This 90s period drama is often derided for being dry and slow-moving. Perhaps the real problem though is the misguided attempts to liven it up. Director Martin Scorsese, best known for his snappy crime flicks, seems unable to allow his style to take a step back for a more sedate story.The Age of Innocence is, from start to finish, essentially one long parade of fancy camera-work. The second scene features a lengthy tracking shot, floating gracefully from one character to the next as a voice-over reads an extract from the novel. It's all expertly done, but it's too artificial, shows too much of the mind behind the camera. At other times he is even more overt. What should have been the most poignant moment is spoiled by a series of quick edits to an earlier scene, spelling out the significance and puncturing the emotion. I don't see why Edith Wharton's novel deserves such treatment – it's a good enough story without such gilding. Scorsese was of course set to direct Schindler's List that year, before handing over control to Steven Spielberg. I shudder to think what he might have done to that movie.It's a pity Scorsese chose to be so ostentatious for The Age of Innocence, all the more so because there are a lot of nice things going on here. The art direction is a gorgeous mass of flowers, paintings and assorted fripperies, dominating every set to an extent that is almost surreal. The cast is a treat too. The role of Newland Archer doesn't tease the best out of Daniel Day-Lewis, but he manages it well, with pursed lips conveying his stifled emotions. Michelle Pfeiffer is exceptional in one crucial scene, venting anger without going over-the-top, leading neatly into her first kiss with Day-Lewis. Winona Ryder's performance works really well in a bright innocence totally free of cliché. It's also wonderful to see piquant British players Miriam Margolyes and Michael Gough.But overall, this picture is just too gimmicky for such things to shine through. The spoken-word extracts from the novel seem not so much to move the plot along but to plug holes in the narrative. Then there is the clunky device of having letters read out, to-camera, by the characters who wrote them. Such cheap tricks divorce the movie from the story's world.

I think Winona Ryder gives the best, most understated performance of her career in this film; Daniel Day-Lewis and Michelle Pfeiffer are both wonderful. The production design is gorgeous, and the cinematography is breathtaking. The direction, as always, is practically perfect. And the story this film tells is one that shouldn't be missed.

34,davidmvining,This is why Scorsese is one of the great filmmakers,10,20 March 2021,"My reaction to Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence reminds me a lot of my reaction to David Lean's Hobson's Choice. Both are great works by master filmmakers that have been overshadowed by more well-known films, but they both prove to me, definitively, of the greatness of the filmmakers in question. There are filmmakers who aren't that great who end up making a single film that fires on every cylinder, but then there's Scorsese having made his name with a particular type of modern and masculine filmmaking making an expert and restrained adaptation of an Edith Wharton novel. He filmed it like he films all of his movies, with active, roving cameras and energetic editing, but he also manages to capture the restrained spirit of the main character, Newland Archer, and his emotional journey perfectly.That being said, the movie still carries many of the hallmarks of Scorsese's career and interests. It's set in New York in the 1870s. It is about a closed society with a strict set of rules of behavior that must be followed. It's about a man who wants something but can't have it because of those rules. All of this is reflected in his previous work. I was reminded mostly of a small moment from Mean Streets when Harvey Keitel's Charlie wants to date the black dancer at Tony's club, but he stands her up because his friends would look down on him for the choice. It's a similar situation that Newland Archer finds himself in when he meets the unfortunate cousin, Ellen, to his fiancée, May.Newland and May are from two of the most prominent families in New York at the time. Ensconced firmly in the ritual of high society, they are products of a system, looked at to fulfil roles rather than lead lives. Newland is outwardly obedient to this system, but he inwardly questions it, never able to share his challenge with anyone, especially not the innocent naïf, May. Ellen, though, was married to a Polish count who ended up treating her terribly and preferring the company of prostitutes to his own wife. Separated from her husband and buried in scandal, she returns to New York to try and figure out her next steps. Newland uses the opportunity of the public announcement of his engagement to May to help provide support to Ellen at the same time, putting two New York families behind the scandal plagued countess instead of just one.Ellen is different from the rest of the society that surrounds Newland. Wizened by the hurts she suffered at the hands of her husband. She wants a divorce to separate her completely from the count, but while the legislature may treat divorce kindly society does not. She will be outcast as a defiled woman. The family wants Newland, an attorney and soon to be member of the family, to convince Ellen of the error of such a course, an action that Newland dutifully follows through on despite his obvious affection for the woman. He's not yet married to May, and she could be free of her husband. He even, at one point early before he falls for Ellen, accepts the idea of eloping with May, burning all convention just to be with the woman he loves. Then, when presented with the opportunity to burn convention to be with this new woman who ignites real passion within him, he wilts at the idea and does not follow through despite what his heart wants.The movie's story is about a year of Newland's life as he tries to balance his heart with his obligations to the stifling system into which he was bred. If he were to cast aside everything for Ellen, not only would he be cast out from society, but his mother and sister would suffer as well. He's also trapped by his promise to wed May, his insistence on a quick engagement, and, soon enough, the wedding itself. He still wants to be close to her, and his passion for the woman he can't have blinds him to the conventions he's breaking, giving the game away to those around him.The movie is narrated by Joanne Woodward in a cool and refined tone, providing detail, mostly about the world around the characters but occasionally offering inside details to Newland, words largely taken from the Edith Wharton source. It's in the farewell dinner for Ellen scene, after Ellen had considered her options and decided to return to the count, even if it meant a less than happy life for herself, where the narration is used most effectively. Explaining the signs that we, an outside audience, might have missed, she demonstrates that the lack of signs mean that everyone knows something that is untrue, that Newland and Ellen are having an affair, everyone, that is, including May. The innocent look on Winona Ryder's face when the narrator explains this ends up betraying a hidden woundedness, and we can immediately sense the hurt that Newland has for having caused pain to May.It was a different time where obligation to promises and systems meant more than individual passions. Ellen goes off back to the count, and Newland remains faithful to May, raising a family of healthy young men and women as their children. Is there sadness in the lost connection that was never fully consummated between Newland and Ellen? Yes, for sure. Is there nothing but sadness? No, not at all. Newland raised a good son with May, a son who would not have existed had he run off with Ellen. When given a final chance to see Ellen again, years later and after May's death, he walks away, leaving Ellen to be a memory.There's a quiet strength to Newland, and Daniel Day Lewis plays him rather perfectly. Caught between his two desires and worlds, he is in complete control of his emotions, carefully expressing his sentiments except in his most unguarded moments with Ellen. Winona Ryder is the innocent as May, wide-eyed and earnest in his loves and fears while looking almost like a doll. Michelle Pfieffer is beautiful and mature as Ellen, a woman caught in a world she doesn't quite understand and between two men, one of whom wants her and can't have her and the other of whom wants her only as a decoration.Scorsese walked into this production with all of his cinematic tools at their best. The production is gorgeous with ornate sets and wonderful costumes. The performances he helped craft are intricate and dedicated. The editing from Thelma Schoonmaker knows when to hold a shot to help establish a setting or an emotion and when to cut quickly or use slow motion to imply a specific point of view. I don't think that it's Scorsese's greatest movie, but this is definitely one of his greatest. It's also evidence that he is one of the greatest of filmmakers, making his unique approach fit well with material that seems unnatural to his previous body of work.",The Age of Innocence
35,richard-1787,A disappointment,3,25 May 2012,"The cinematography in this movie is often breathtakingly beautiful.And the performance and pacing often leaden, which kills it.It was as if the whole movie were one long funeral dirge. Which is not at all how the novel reads.It is VERY hard to deal with a novel where most of the action happens in the thoughts of the characters, rather than in dialogue and action. Scorsese did not solve that dilemma here.Yes, Wharton saw most of these characters as having superficial lives, but when they spoke their words, they spoke them naturally. But these actors, most of them, though very fine in other movies, deliver too much of this dialogue - which, I realize, was taken directly from the novel - as if they were not native speakers of English, or at least not native speakers of that English. It is, in short, the problem some actors have with Shakespeare. The great Shakespearean actors manage to deliver their lines with perfect naturalness. Too often, in this movie, the lines came off as very stilted.There were lots of other problems as well. But, in general, it was all too funereal, too leaden. That is not the world Wharton paints.What a shame to have wasted so much talent with so unimpressive results.",The Age of Innocence
36,Galina_movie_fan,Martin Scorsese's Most Violent Film,10,7 November 2009,"Martin Scorsese's film The Age of Innocence (1993) is an adaptation of a 1920 novel by Edith Wharton, which won the 1921 Pulitzer Prize. Both, the novel and the film are set in upper class New York City in the 1870s.The Age of Innocence is the movie that proves once again what a versatile talented, unpredictable, incredibly passionate, and artistically outstanding director Martin Scorsese is. Recently I saw for the first time Scorsese's comedy After Hours and was fascinated how masterful he was in creating a darkly funny surreal comedy. Now, after re-watching The Age of Innocence, I am sure that Scorsese has made one of the most beautiful, tragic, passionate, sensual, sexually charged screen romances ever, which is at the same time perfectly suitable for the whole family watching. It is PG rated, and the characters speak in refined, almost forgotten English. The director himself described The Age of Innocence as the ""most violent"" film he's ever made, clearly referring to the inner turmoil, disappointment and resignation the two main characters of this drama go through.The material world Scorsese created and paints with his lenses is of incredible beauty. Michael Ballhaus' camera brings out the perfection of craftsmanship of every object it looks at: be it the costumes (Oscar statuette for Gabriella Pescucci who has dressed the heroes of The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988), Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005), Der Name der Rose (1986), and Upon a Time in America (1984) to name a few), china, crystal, silver, flower arrangements, jewelry or furniture. The exquisite meals looked delicious and required a special food consultant who was mentioned in the film's credits. Or take for example these elegant leather ladies gloves with small buttons. Who would think that unbuttoning a glove on the hand of a beautiful woman slowly, tenderly, makes one of the most erotic scene ever filmed? The people who inhabited this world of beauty, comfort, and privilege seem the perfect happy creatures but not all is so perfect in the paradise. Two beautiful passionate people found love that could only happen once in a life time but the strict norms or society they live in and the unbending unwritten rules based on convention and hypocrisy they must obey won't permit them to follow their hearts freely, to fulfill their desire, and to be happy in that Age of Innocence. The cast is superb, and includes Daniel Day-Lewis, the film protagonist Newland Archer, Michelle Pfeiffer, as Countess Olenska, a woman with ""a Past"" who stole his heart, and very young Winona Ryder, May Welland, the girl whom Archer will marry. 22 years old Ryder very deservingly received the Oscar nomination for her performance. I would like to mention Joanne Woodward's subtle narrating of Edith Wharton's prose which is one of the high points of the film. IMO, the film has only high points and is Martin Scorsese's fine (perhaps, the finest) and stunning achievement.",The Age of Innocence
37,nycritic,"A Mob Family Which Doesn't Use Violence, But Smiles and Good Manners.",10,18 April 2005,"The deliberate slowness of the camera as it moves throughout scenes; the way characters react to one another with little more than glances and smiles and polite gestures who imply much more than what they say; the theme of a rigid society and the woman who unknowingly disrupts it with her ""scandalous"" conduct; the story of a repressed love affair: this is not the stuff that makes Martin Scorcese films as he's more known as a filmmaker of aggressive, extremely violent films depicting mainly Italian-Americans in a gritty New York City. However, while the story is upper-crust WASP, the visual imprints are his, and the violence is completely internal, emotional, equally if not more devastating.Contemplative, but no less involving, is the core of this movie's visual attitude. With so much subtext just simmering underneath the events told in THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, any other approach would have reduced the impact that its denouement reveals. Scorcese uses a tremendous amount of visual tricks to emphasize what or whom we should look at: spotlighting Pfeiffer and Day-Lewis as they enjoy a quiet conversation during the intermission in a play; overlapping series of fleeting images from snippets of correspondence between characters; slowing the action down for about five seconds in a key scene (when Pfeiffer gets up from her seat, crosses a room full of guests to go talk to Day-Lewis as Woodward narrates ""It was not the custom for a lady to get up ... and talk to another man.""). His technique forces us to really watch the story, to look for details, overt and covert, since like the opening montage of roses in bloom at the beginning of the credits, this is a movie of deep contemplation -- not because of the lush images, but because of the subtle game of tradition which is being played behind the curtains, just out of the camera's view. Nothing is what it seems, and in the exceptional case of Winona Ryder's incredibly sly portrayal of May Welland, that becomes true: she knows much more than her character reveals, and when she does so, it's only with a loving glance. She is aware of her husband's attraction to Ellen Olenska, and even casually feeds him into it, only to chain him to her at the end when all is revealed and nothing can be done. And this is what makes the movie so ultimately tragic and emotionally jarring: that true love is consciously allowed to be crushed in lieu of family tradition, which is the overwhelming hypocrisy of the people inhabiting Edith Wharton's timeless novel.",The Age of Innocence

I took the first option and watched it.Even though this is a costume drama, this isn't the typical sugar sweet stuff that I've already seen too many times before, although it really looked that way at first. Only when you can stay with it long enough, you'll see that it actually criticizes the restrictive high society of late-19th century New York, that its sugar coating hides a lot of bitterness and sadness.Perhaps it is because I'm not really interested in this time period, perhaps it is because when I think of drama, I rather like to read books or see movies about ordinary people who have to work hard to make something of their lives. I don't know, but this wasn't really my kind of movie. I admit that it is well-crafted and that the acting is really very convincing, but it just isn't my cup of tea. I give it a 6/10.

42,sharky_55,I can't have my happiness made out of a wrong to someone else.,7,21 July 2016,"The world of The Age of Innocence, Old New York in the 1870s, is one ruled by reputation and tradition. Scorsese outlines this first and foremost in his production design and costume, ornate as it is unnecessary. His camera floats through the heralded halls of these great institutions a step above the common man; glittery chandeliers, display cases groaning with jewels, walls adorned from head to toe in paintings and lavish dinners all year long. The narration, provided by Joanne Woodward, emphasises and approves of every swoop. Her tone is gentle, yet authoritative, as if she has been watching this family for generations and seldom has to step in. The members are part of a self-reinforcing cycle which sucks in any potentials like Newland Archer and polishes him into another shin statue. Their dinner tables are a breeding ground for gossip, and we understand that even a whisper could determine the fate of a fellow member. Their words are plain on the surface, disguised as pleasantries, but full of veiled threat. So naturally Scorsese is drawn to this story. He started with gangster flicks based on his childhood in Little Italy, and how the unspoken code shaped and morphed a character's actions. This is very much the same idea, but in a ""exquisitely refined sense"". It twists itself around a tale of forbidden love, where passion clashes with tradition. Initially he is overjoyed to have made it here, from what we can assume are lower standings. Then the treasonous actions of Ellen open his eyes, and he begins to fight. So curiously, Newland seems in control, but a more than cursory glance reveals that he is imprisoned like all the others, stifled by the ever demanding dance and song. He talks and obsesses constantly over escape, but in the only possible opportunity to actually do so, he relents. In the latter half of the film, he all but resigns to a constant glumness, and on the eve of his last stand, caught like a rat in the trap, once again helpless. It is an excruciating existence, although not nearly as noble as the film makes it out to be with its whispered revelations.Day-Lewis nevertheless makes the most out of it. The character and setting call for outer repression, far cry from the flash that he has become known for in his later career. From the neck down his suit is a prison, locking his stance into place, reinforcing his social prominence, so he must emote with his eyes, with his head, with his pursed and flattened lips. Each word is a battle - he must force himself to speak what is expected of him, not what is on his mind. Pfeiffer on the other hand, is disappointing. She is given the most provocative character, in an age where divorce is scandalous beyond reprieve, but the casting is already works against her. She is asked to be more than the blonde bombshell, to be the electrifying spark that ignites Newland's passion. Instead it is her mere rebellious existence that does this for her, her beauty for good measure, and her actions as an afterthought. Ellen is played against May, who naturally has no chance. Newland is attracted to the mystical quality of the imagined Ellen, who is the talk of the entire community, who resonates femininity and independence. But this Pfeiffer is not. It is all talk, it occurs offscreen, with Woodward filling us in. She is the vision of all he had missed, but simply a vision. May is actually the most interesting. Ryder plays her to perfection; petite, doe-eyed, simpering at every turn, almost too pleased with herself. But more is asked of her than any other of her companions. She breaks character only twice (perhaps not even that, as she cluelessly queries Newland in the carriage on what she is expected to notice as high born lady), giving Newland his first and only out by acknowledging the implication of an affair (and in doing so opens herself up to the same branding as Ellen's). Then Ryder slips back into her role, forever destined to be smiling and curtsying and pretending that her husband does not have eyes for another woman, never mind her cousin. But Scorsese condescends; she drones on about trifling matters, and the soundtrack drowns her out. Newland sees an escape, and then reading a letter once more confining him, the screen darkens but for a stripe of light across his eyes, as though he is the only victim here. So it culminates in a stuffy show of style, which has all the hallmarks of Scorsese gone wild. The camera sweeps across the overwrought mise en scene, taking in every drop of its intoxicating musk, and then again and again, until Scorsese's lavishness eventually becomes folded into the film itself, masturbatory and ostentatious instead of ironic. The narration concurs; it chases after every loose strand, every unexplained phenomena, and doubly underlines it for the audience. It becomes as blind as Newland is, declaring that May died purely, thinking the world a good and honest place. If only it had for her half the concern it has for Newland.",The Age of Innocence

It's Scorsese doing costume-drama with an elegant pace, and he's uncovering a tangling story of a society's unchallenged rules and conventions. He uses a narrative voice-over through the beautifully dissolving images, and the dialogs are bristling with suppressed emotion that are differently coming through the three main characters. Daniel Day Lewis and Winona Ryder plays Newland Archer and May Welland, an engaged couple that's socializing in the upper-class of New York City in the 1870ties. When May's cousin, Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) arrives because of her current escaping of her husband in Europe, Archer gets involved because of his lawyer occupation and naturally through family-relational reasons. They develop a romancing relationship that sees Archer's already second-thoughts on New York's social life advance further.

Even though it's not one of his best works, its still a film to admire.The film is a period piece. The film is about a nice man named Newland Archer(played with sweetness by Daniel Day Lewis), who is engaged to a nice girl(played with even more sweetness by Winona Ryder) and claims to love her, though he doesn't really know her all that well. But he ends up falling for her cousin(played by Michelle Pfeifer), and in this time, that sort of thing was very wrong, and still is.Even though Lewis' character is doing a wrong thing, you still feel for him and care about him. Its mainly because he's such a nice character, and he is actually haunted by what he's doing. And I admire that.The Age of Innocence is a little slow. But the performances are delightful and strong, and the ending is wonderful. I didn't love The Age of Innocence quite as much as I wanted to, but I still enjoyed it. It's probably Scorsese's first and last chick flick. So, I recommend it to them, and anyone who is up for it. It's a good one, but it sure is a slow one.B+",The Age of Innocence
48,Blue-Grotto,25th Anniversary!,8,3 September 2018,"A love triangle develops among the elite in 1870s New York with a kind hearted yet undecisive man, Newland, at the center of it. His attention is divided between Ellen and May. Ellen is imaginative, well-traveled, thoughtful and sophisticated. She has Newland's heart. May is rather dull in comparison, but she has Newland's balls in her purse. Ellen and Newland are equally committed to other people and debilitated by conventions, rules and expectations, so they try to distance themselves from each other through acts of kindness. However, the kinder they are to each other the more their attraction grows. It gets to the point that Ellen and Newland cannot live with or without each other and they struggle to find a path forward.Elaborate, colorful and decadent, the Age of Innocence has all the richness expected from a major Hollywood production. This includes the dazzling talents and brilliant performances by Daniel Day-Lewis (Newland), Michelle Pfeiffer (Ellen) and even, surprisingly, Winona Ryder (May). These actors appear to relish their characters. Score for the casting agents! The film is deliciously full of quotes from Edith Wharton, which adds to the authenticity and charm of the film. If the Age of Innocence did not win awards for its wardrobe crew, it would be criminal negligence.

I always thought films such as this, based on old times whether colonial or American (as in this film of gangs of new york, both set in new york hundreds of years ago), or in europe, are tough to make, however Scorsese achieves in creating a great mood for this film, and keeps it interesting throughout. Its a great love triangle type story but not a typical film at all. The cast is great as Daniel Day Lewis gives one of his best performances (on par with The Last of the mohicans and gangs of new york). Winona Ryder is also great here matching her great performance in The Crucible (which Day Lewis was also great in).

50,khatcher-2,Over 150 minutes of heart-rending tediousness,2,24 May 2001,"It should be obvious that Wharton was not Pushkin, nor is Scorsese Ingmar Bergman.The attempted custombrism of Edith Wharton is false and insipid, lacking grounding in the best French or Spanish tradition, and all attempts at reaching epic proportions pales into insignificance beside the great masters  Tolstoy, Sholakhov, Doestoyevsky, among others.That Martin Scorsese, a director who has amply shown his calibre in such films as `The Last Temptation of Christ', `The Color of The Money' and `Taxi Driver' among his best titles, should try his hand at an involuted regentist victorianism so abhorred by Europeans for at least 75 years, is more than surprising and turns out in the end to be even irritating. Pérez-Galdós would have been greatly angered by any similar treatment of his `Fortunata y Jacinta', for example. If Wharton in 1870 was decidedly retrograde, Scorsese in 1993 was definitely on another planet. How or why Scorsese could ever have been inspired to make a pretence replica of anything in the style of the magnificent `Fanny och Alexander' just beggars belief. He builds a sumptuous, even fastidious, set, decorates it with some rather good actors, and uses highly toned up coloring, no doubt as if to add insult to grievous occular harm, which, for 1870 New York, was indeed a gross insolence and incoherent injustice.The dialogues are somewhat akin to the luscious-looking dishes spread out on the extravagant tables: made of plastic and indigestible, however brilliantly  sic  they may have been filmed.So much mannerism and forced modalities, at times taking on tragicomedy theatrical proportions, seemed as authentic as a penguin acting as a tourist guide in `La Alhambra'.The non-original music included some good pieces, even though `Alerte! Alerte!' from `Faust' by Charles Gounod did not appear in the Paris Opera in its final grand opera form until March 1869, making its début in the Metropolitan a few years later; using the same recording as that used by Tony Richardson in `The Phantom of the Opera' three years earlier is not merely an unhappy coincidence; and some thirty seconds of Enya during a scene of hundreds of men hanging on to their bowler hats in the driving wind was a laughable misfit at best.The result is more than 150 minutes of tedious inconsequentiality: late nineteenth century wealthy upper-crust goings-on in their own conceived quagmire of supposed respectability and lushly veneered egocentric hypocracy, is out of touch with more genuine humanity.

52,Rockwell_Cronenberg,"An interesting, but failed, departure.",4,27 March 2012,"Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence is a slightly interesting departure for him, trading in his mean streets and firearms for the 19th century and romantic affairs. Co-adapted by Jay Cocks from the novel by Edith Wharton, the director has been known to say that this is his most violent film, an obvious reference to the emotional violence that takes place as opposed to the more direct, physical confrontations in the majority of his films. It's an interesting idea and that violence is played out by a superb cast topped by Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder. Day-Lewis takes on the role of Newland Archer, who is recently engaged to Ryder's May Welland but finds himself having difficulty masking his desires for her cousin, Pfeiffer's Ellen Olenska. It's your standard set up for this kind of period piece and it's not told in any way that makes it stand out, but the acting is enough to keep it relatively engaging throughout.Day-Lewis has gotten worlds of acclaim and two Oscar statues for his theatrical, outlandish performances but I've honestly always preferred him in his more subtle, intimate displays and here is another example of him showing what a great actor he can be when he holds things in. The emotions are mostly underneath the surface in this film, and Scorsese was smart enough to cast three actors who were superb at portraying them in the perfect tone, expressing those emotions quietly without overdoing it to the audience or to the other characters on screen. They remain true to their characters and to the time period. Michelle Pfeiffer is the most open character, often questioning the ideals of the time period, and she gets to show the most outward emotion, which she does extremely well. She's a woman torn apart by her desires and what she believes is right, expertly portraying that ongoing internal conflict.Winona Ryder may just be the most impressive of the cast, though, which is something I wasn't expecting to say because at first she felt incredibly miscast in this period setting. Over time she developed her character so well and it's the perfect contrast to Pfeiffer's Olenska. While Olenska is more of an adult an an intellectual equal to Archer, his fiancée Welland is naive and childish. She's not necessarily immature, but she succumbs so quickly to what everyone else wants of her and spends much of her life just trying to not upset others. It's a performance that doesn't allow her to do much on the surface, but what Ryder does underneath is wondrous to behold. There's a scene where Welland informs Archer that Olenska is leaving New York to back to Europe, and in his reaction she finally realizes his feelings for her cousin. Ryder doesn't say a word addressing this realization, but through her eyes and the way her face sinks, through the slight change of tone in her voice, she absolutely breaks your heart.Scorsese has always been adept at crafting an atmosphere for his films, but I don't think that particular skill of his shines through here at all. It seems like he's lost in this period setting and as a result it all falls a little flat. The acting keeps it together, but there isn't anything memorable in terms of the tone and it essentially just feels like an Ivory clone at the end of it. There are a few stylistic choices that he takes to set it apart, but these end up being the biggest flaws of the film. Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus takes an interesting approach by shooting most of the early scenes from the far side of the room they're set in. He rarely uses close-ups, instead framing the whole room in the shot in order to give the audience a richer look at all of the sets and production design. It provides for a deliberately picturesque atmosphere that I found quite impressive. Although it only works because the actors are competent enough to work in this format, performing almost as if they were on stage.However, they stopped doing this somewhere down the line and things got significantly less interesting as a result. There are still some very beautiful shots used throughout the later stages of the film, but they weren't as unique or interesting as what he had been doing earlier on. I thought the characters trips to the theater were interesting, allowing for a contrast between the large emotions on stage and the restrained ones that our characters portrayed, but they didn't utilize this theme nearly enough. My main problem with the film though, lies in the narration, which is absurdly over-done. The film relies far too much on it, using the voice-over work to spoon feed every drop of background information to the audience. It felt practically as if there was more narrated dialogue than there was delivered by the actual characters on screen.There was a welcome reprieve every time I got to see a character begin to speak, but this only lasted a few minutes before we went right back into the crutch of presenting nice images while the narration rambled on and on endlessly. This over-reliance also forces the film to present any scenes of characters reading letters by shooting the character who wrote the letter and having them read it directly to the audience, staring straight into the camera, a system that is incredibly awkward and distracting. The Age of Innocence was a nice attempt by Scorsese and it was good of him to try to stretch himself out of the niche he had built, but ultimately I don't think he was very successful.",The Age of Innocence
53,inframan,"Very pretty, like a Vogue spread but S-L-O-W-W-W",2,27 November 2003,"I think this film's obsessions with depicting the clothes, furnishings & eating habits of the period in which the story takes place are as emblematic of the period in which it was made, when character was/is secondary to decor. I can understand & appreciate Mr. Scorsese's efforts to pace the actors' readings, a valiant essay at simulating the dialogs of another age, but it only emphasizes the weaknesses of the performances of his primary actresses, Pfeiffer & Ryder, who whine away from a self-oriented post-Freudian core. Very disappointing.",The Age of Innocence
54,mnpollio,A beautiful curio devoid of passion,5,16 June 2011,"One really has to give director Martin Scorsese some credit for stepping outside of his comfort zone of mobsters and brutality to take on the task of rendering Edith Wharton's stodgy prose into a watchable drama. Unfortunately, the task appears to be beyond him.The Age of Innocence is Wharton's exploration into the finer details of New York high society circa the late 19th century. The focal character is attorney Newland Archer (played here by Daniel Day-Lewis), who is the walking personification of pristine high society. He is engaged to be married to the oh-so-acceptable May Welland (Winona Ryder), but then meets her ""scandalous"" cousin, the Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), a black sheep now that she has separated from her husband. Suddenly Newland's heart is all atwitter and he finds himself willing to risk his reputation and social standing to pursue her.The central romance is strangely missing any romance, much less passion. Scorsese seems far more enamored of the set design, costumes and fancy finery, then he is with the people at the heart of the action. The majority of the people seem anemic, with possibly the exception of a feisty Miriam Margoyles, who seems far more scandalous than Pfeiffer with her loud and oddly hilarious outbursts. Lots of time is spent documenting the dinnerware, etiquette and bearing of the elites, to the point where one starts to cast longing gazes at their watch. And in case you don't get it, Scorsese has decided to include mind-numbingly obvious narration from the cultured tones of Joanne Woodward. Woodward's narration becomes increasingly intrusive to the point where it not only tells us that someone walks across the room (as though we did not witness it), but gives us insight into what people are thinking, as if this is not something the performances should be doing.When not doting on the lovely china, draperies and lace doilies, Scorsese employs rather annoying camera tricks to open or close scenes, and gives us endless montages of hothouse flowers ripening in stop motion - to hint at the emotion roiling beneath the surface of these well-dressed mannequins. Oh, the depth! Some of the acting is quite fine, even with the restrictions placed on it by the storyline. It is intriguing to watch Day-Lewis portray such an inhibited character as Newland Archer. We have some degree of sympathy for Newland, although he brings a lot of his misery on himself. However, we never have much respect for him, because at heart the character is incredibly weak and allows himself to repeatedly be at the mercy of those around him. Day-Lewis conveys a great deal of the frustration and angst of the character. Unfortunately, one thing that does not get conveyed is the longing and passion of his love for the Countess.This last is certainly not all Day-Lewis' fault. Pfeiffer's scandalous cousin is such a jaw-dropping bore and played by the usually reliable actress with such lifelessness that it is impossible to understand how she can awaken longing in anyone. Pfeiffer, strangely resembling a young Lucille Ball here, carries herself ramrod straight with a slight air of discomfort, as though she was bothered by hemorrhoids. She delivers her lines either haltingly or breathlessly in a manner that strains patience. Were it not for the incessant reminders, we would detect nothing interesting - much less scandalous - about her. In fact, she hardly seems to be suffering as a pariah at all since she seems to chronically show up at all of the prime spots. Even worse, her character pales in comparison to May Welland, who is supposed to be the duller of the two women.And here we have another of the film's faults. Winona Ryder is positively radiant as May and delivers one of her last great performances prior to becoming this generation's Hedy Lamarr and forgetting how to act. She does a fantastic job of portraying Archer's still waters run deep fiancée and often seems a far more intriguing love interest. When she senses the attraction between Newland and her cousin, she repeatedly offers him an out to launch his pursuit, which he fails to take her up on. Later, when Newland decides he wants an out at a far more inappropriate time, she does a grand job of insidiously psychologically closing off his paths for escape and ensuring his continued subservience to her, even if he is only going through the motions. Ryder's performance is really quite wonderful here and the fact that one remembers her character far more so than Pfeiffer's indicates a vital flaw in the piece.Due to so much exposition and pontificating on the backdrops, the film is entirely too long for its slight story and it feels it. By the time it grinds to its predictable and emotionally muted conclusion, one is more than ready for the experience to be over. The final sequence with an older Day-Lewis offered the opportunity to once again meet and continue his relationship with Pfeiffer (with the approval of his now late wife) only to culminate with him sitting dumbfounded on a bench before walking away without meeting her ranks as one of the most pointless codas on a film. Truly, the film would have been more improved had Scorsese ended it following the final confrontation between Day-Lewis and Ryder.A lovely looking film, but unless you are interested in seeing Scorsese direct a change-of-pace film or have a particular affinity for Wharton's wallows in misery, there is not a lot here to satisfy.",The Age of Innocence
55,dy158,Nice adaptation.,9,6 July 2006,"It's been four years since I last read this Edith Wharton's novel of the same name. I borrowed it from the school library then, mainly because I was curious about it. So I am thankful I realised that there's a movie adaptation to this and managed to catch it on cable.From someone who had read the novel before (who almost forgot how the whole plot went till recently...oops!), it's a way to refresh some of the things which happened. To imagine acclaimed director Martin Scorsese is the one who directed this is clearly surprising for me.It is the 1870s New York social scene. Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is engaged to May Welland (Winona Ryder). But there comes the arrival of May's unconventional cousin Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer). Life for Newland and May was almost perfect till the Countess came along. It turned out later that actually Countess Ellen Olenska wanted to have a divorce from her husband.At that time, divorce is often being frowned upon, even with the high ranks of the society in New York. But, Newland found himself drawn to the Countess despite at times he knew May was suspicious of him and his actions. Newland and May did eventually got married and had a son and a daughter along the way. The Countess almost soon became only a fading memory from Newland's mind till his son Ted mentioned her name...Speaking from someone who had last read the book four years back and only remembered the main characters' names (Newland, May and the Countess Olenska) since, it's good I can tell myself that my image of the main characters are almost close to whoever they are on the screen. More or less justified what I had hoped.",The Age of Innocence

57,cinephile-27690,Martin's Marvelous Masterpiece!,10,18 July 2019,"For Martin Scorsese, 1993 really was The Age of Innocence! There are no illegal drugs in this movie, or nude characters(save some paintings-which are literally there for artistic purpose), and the profanity is cut down to one h*ll and a 7 letter mild curse, which is different compared to hundreds of F bombs and other curses in most lines spoken!The entire movie seems odd for the man who directed Goodfellas 3 years prior, but many analysis's on You Tube argue otherwise, that the tension is the most ""violent"" part of the film-and such aspects make it a film to be compared to such films as Goodfellas. (Scorsese himself has stated that this is his most violent movie-in a figurative sense.)The plot focuses on Daniel Day Lewis's character, who is engaged to Winona Ryder. (I grew up seeing her in Beetle-juice and Little Women, but it occurred to me now that she is a gorgeous woman! Too bad she's married...) Anyways, while he is announcing his engagement, he meets his fiancee's cousin-played by Michelle Pfeiffer.He starts to fall in love with her, and his engagement has an internal struggle. Even Winona's character mentions that he is changing for the worse. From here, he must deal with this temptation to officially cheat on his fiancee. (Making Age compareable to The Last Temptation of Christ.)The easiest thing I can praise about The Age of Innocence is the appearance-in particular the cinematography and the costumes. The camera work is astounding-it may be the best Scorsese has ever done. (Well, technically Micheal Ballhaus did that, but you get what I mean.)15 minutes in there is a shot where people are dancing and the twirling is a magnificent shot! I've seen that shot a few times and my mouth still drops and my eyes still widen when I see it. There is also a shot where some glasses are being ""perfectly"" set and they glisten and shine that even glasses are astonishing!Also, Elaine and Saul Bass are credited to making the most beautiful credit sequence I have ever seen, which has numerous blooming flowers. This sequence is the best part of the movie for me, honestly, aside from that twirling shot.The movie's look is comparable to My Fair Lady, which I called ""one of the most perfect movies ever made"" on here!I do have a minor issue with it-and that's that there are so many details in the plot that I had to see it twice to get more out of it, and I feel that no matter the more I see it, there will always be more to get out of the movie. However, this makes me want to see the movie many more times-and eventually I will!When Scorsese made The Departed, he said it was ""his 1st movie with a plot."" A movie like Age may magnify his point. While there is a plot, it doesn't follow a story-line flow, so this makes some details pop out in future viewings. And for this movie, I am absolutely okay with that.Also, this movie has a 7.2 rating here, while Martin Scorsese profane crime films like The Wolf of Wall Street and Casino have a 10% higher rating! HOW? This movie needs more attention-and I hope this review aids that! (There are only 170 reviews of this movie on this site as of now!)If you love Martin Scorsese, this is a must see movie. If you are not a fan due to his violence, swearing, and sexual content, then even more so! The Age Of Innocence is a movie FOR the ages!",The Age of Innocence
58,eabakkum,Crooked relations in a degenerate society,8,2 January 2012,"I used the last days of December to watch some films, that I found inspiring about a decade ago. The film The Age of Innocence was among them. Around 2000 I watched it quite a number of times, and was deeply moved by the social and emotional atmosphere. I tried to analyze the dialogs, which are evidently ambiguous on the psychological level. I even read the book by Edith Wharton, which closely resembles the film. Or to be more precise, the film manages to give a very accurate portrayal of the book. At the time I empathized with the dilemma of the main male character, Newland Archer, namely the impossible choice between two very different women. Today to my surprise I found it unpleasant to see The Age of Innocence again. The narrative and the characters irritated me, and I had to force myself to watch the thing until its end. Since the film has not changed, it must be my new perspective on such matters. I find the moaning and whining of Archer, and his wives May (true) and Ellen (off the record) disgusting and crooked. This does not mean, that I question the credibility of the story. On the contrary, three-cornered love affairs are probably fairly common. I am sure that it is possible to make a psycho-analysis of the characters, that would make their behavior rational. My problem is, that as distinct from a twelve years ago I am no longer prepared to indulge in this psycho-analysis. It is just not a theme. The appearance of the relations is simply too tragic. The situations of the main characters are devoid of hope, and nevertheless they seem to find their fate agreeable. Thus their mental states look utterly ill. Should the inability of Archer to make a choice not motivate him to abandon both women? For it is obvious that neither May or Ellen gives him complete satisfaction.A decade ago I did not yet grasp the importance of the society on the fate of the main characters. It may be that Archer and his wives should broaden their social insight, but their community forbids them to do so. It is supposed to be the elite of New York, but their social circle is decaying. Archer may be an excellent advocate - I doubt it - but he is definitely bourgeois. At about the same time the economist T.B. Veblen made a study of the important families of the USA. Veblen felt, that these families and also the new rising class of large entrepreneurs were totally useless and even harmful. They led a life of wasteful ostentation and opulence, which Veblen called ""conspicuous consumption"". This elite preferred to earn their income by means of speculation and manipulations, that where damaging to the productivity. Fortunately thanks to the ""instinct of workmanship"" of the technicians the enterprises remained healthy, which allowed the progress to continue. The picture of Veblen of the elite as an isolated class fits nicely with the decadence shown in The Age of Innocence.A nasty theme does not disqualify a film. The life in a degenerated community and its lack of progress are just unpleasant to watch.",The Age of Innocence

60,ldavis-2,The Age of Tediousness!,2,7 February 2006,"Daniel Day-Lewis is a strange-looking man. Hollow cheeks. Slits for eyes. Squarely flat chin. Jowls that won't quit. His hands are flat, and his fingers are long and spindly and webbed with veins. Like Ralph Fiennes (whose features can only be described as pathetic), nothing about Day-Lewis says macho. And the harder he tries to be a he-man, the more he looks like Maria Shriver!I remember the huzzahs the critics greeted The Age of Innocence with, in particular, how Richard Schickel was all over it like a whore on a $20 bill. I finally saw it last night on TCM. When the director resorts to slow motion, lap dissolves, steadicam zooms - even irises - then you know he knows he's got a stinker on his hands, but is trying desperately not to let you know he knows! The use of a narrator was another sign Scorsese was half-assing it. It was a cheat and unnecessary.In the middle of this is Day-Lewis. The guy may have been born with the prerequisite burr up his ass, but his Archer is a total wuss. I actually laughed when he kissed Pfeiffer's feet (you'd think, reading the script, he would have gone ""Are you sh*tting me?"") Was that a hug or were they impersonating lumberjacks? The only thing more ridiculous was how she kept telling him how needy she was, then leveled a stare that could freeze Hell!Ryder seemed so intent on making May a martyr, she utterly failed to convey the knowing underneath. After all, May was born and raised for the job. When she tells Archer she told Ellen she was preggers before she knew for sure, she doesn't let on that she knows she's just f***ed him up, f***ed him up good! So when Ted (why his name was changed from Dallas is not for us lesser minds to ponder) tells Archer May told him he is such a great guy, he gave up the one thing he wanted for the sake of appearances, it's another cheat.Another thing that had me scratching my head was how Mrs. Mingott had all this power when you know she got it by marrying it. Why does she back Ellen, but tell the far more-virtuous Mrs. Beaufort, who is in the exact same situation, to take a hike?Instead of drawing us into this rarefied world, Scorsese makes it impossible to understand why these characters feel trapped. Why didn't Archer and Ellen just run off and go West, where no one gave a rat's ass, and you could make it up as you go along? I know that's not in the book, but at least it would have made me feel I hadn't wasted 2 1/2 hours of my life for nothing!",The Age of Innocence

This is yet another example.Scorsese surpasses his material to make a beautiful, bravura nmasterpiece. This is an expressionist film, in which we enter the soul of Newland Archer, all too proper gentleman and would be free spirit, as he is torn between the allure of seeming non-conformity-the Countess Olenska, and the demands of tradition and duty-May Welland.People who think its an atypical Scorsese film have never-and i repeat , NEVER paid careful attention to his films, or have only watched them for the violence and the f-words.Scorsese has always been a tormented moralist, obsessed with loyalty, honor and tradition.

63,thefan-2,Beautiful but flawed,7,27 May 1999,"The problem with this movie is that Winona Ryder and Michelle Pfeiffer are miscast by about 180 degrees.  What makes Edith Wharton's novel such a great read is that May Welland is a babe-and-a-half, the Belle of New York, desired by every man who sets eyes on her.  Newland Archer is the lucky dog who wins her heart.  Ellen Olenska, on the other hand, is a dark little woman who attracts Archer not with her looks but with her worldliness.  But instead of the big athletic blonde at whose feet men want to throw themselves, Winona Ryder's May Welland is slight and rather anemic. The only reason you can think for Newland Archer to stay with her, and not run off with Ellen Olenska, is that he feels sorry for her.  Michelle Pfeiffer is a little better as Ellen Olenska, but you still sense in her the big bankable Hollywood star gamely doing whatever her handlers tell her to.Look at the archery competition scene some time. As played by Winona Ryder, May Welland's most characteristic gesture is a kind of apologetic smiling and shrugging.  When she wins, it's almost by accident.  You half expect to see a man standing at her elbow helping her to manage the bow and arrows.  There is absolutely nothing of Wharton's May Welland in her performance in this scene.  When on of the men acidly remarks that that's the only bull's-eye she'll ever hit, you think to yourself what a pity poor May is both plain *and* stupid, when in fact what you're hearing is the world's first Dumb Blonde joke.",The Age of Innocence

Scorsese is just the Man director if you know what I mean.I am not a fan of romantic works but if the latter happens to be satisfying to my brain then the movie finds its way swimmingly to my library just like ""The Age of Innocence"" did.I enjoyed the performances of the three actors; Daylewis, Pfeiffer, and Ryder. Especially Winona, she really made me hate her for what she did.The ending was another successful part of the movie that you can enjoy watching alone many times without the rest of the movie because it has so much interpretations to it.The characters are so full that you can debate them with an intellectual friend or group and enjoy doing it for so much time.You owe it to Scorsese to watch this one.",The Age of Innocence
65,FilmSnobby,Jake La Motta in a frock coat.,1,16 August 2004,"Martin Scorsese directing  *The Age of Innocence*  can be compared to  ""McG"" (the auteur behind the  *Charlie's Angels*  franchise)  directing a remake of Bergman's  *Wild Strawberries*.  If it don't fit, you must . . . uh, quit!Apart from the New York setting, it's hard to perceive how Scorsese felt that he had an affinity for this material.  The very first scene indicates a drastic mismatch.  He employs split-second cutting, breakneck Steadicam zooms, and at one point I think he even fiddles with the camera speed:  and for what?  a scene at an opera house, attended by the elite of 1870's  ""Old New York"".  Look out, folks! -- it's Goodfellas-Meets-High Society!  Jake La Motta is crashing the party!  Clearly, Scorsese is terrified of losing our attention in this movie -- hence the endless succession of pointless stylistic flourishes throughout the 2-1/2-hour running-time.  After the seventh Olde-Style iris fadeout, one starts longing for the simplicity, taste, and self-confidence of James Ivory.In fact, Scorsese's adaption of Wharton's novel is a textbook case of Having No Confidence In What You Are Doing.  The gimmicky direction is, of course, the sort of bluff and bluster typical of defensiveness.  But the script, which treats the novel like a sacred text, also indicates a lack of confidence.  Scorsese includes virtually every character from the novel, with incoherent results:  half the time, we don't know which character another character is referring to.  Too many names, too many characters to keep up with.  (One of them, ""Fanny Ring"", is mentioned a dozen times in the movie, but we never meet her.)  If one has read the book, one has an easier time of things . . . but I hadn't read the novel yet when this film came out a decade ago, and consequently had some difficulty following the thread of the fairly dense plot.  While it's easy to keep things straight in Wharton's novel, the movie, by insisting on including EVERYTHING, must skim frantically over the backstory minutiae, ultimately leading to windiness in the script and confusion for the viewer.  Even the dialog is lifted directly from the novel:  this can sometimes be praiseworthy, but, given the context of this movie, it rather indicates that the filmmakers don't really have a point of view about the whole thing.  They're copying sentences here, not forging an adaptation.  Of course, it goes without saying that the movie fails to include the most important aspect of the novel, which is Wharton's cool ironic distance.  The results are disastrous:  the film brings the weepy ladies'-novel plot to the foreground, and pushes the thematic context to the margins.  Again, one starts to appreciate the skilled adaptations of James Ivory.Scorsese's lack of confidence is most glaring in the performances he gets from the principal actors.  He reserves all the flourishes for himself, and allows Daniel Day-Lewis to turn in a zombified performance.  Newland Archer may be a dilettante in Wharton's novel, but he most decidedly is NOT the automaton that Day-Lewis offers us here.  It's disappointing that Day-Lewis, an actor of primal passions, miscalculates the role of Archer so badly, but there you have it.  As for Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder:  the former is miscast, and the latter just isn't any good.  Bottom line:  if Scorsese couldn't get the movie made without the use of  ""name""  actresses whom he seemed unsure about, why did he bother?  Just let James Ivory do the thing with Royal Shakespeare Company alumni, and be done with it.Along those lines, one can take serious issue with the ultimate hypocrisy actuating this whole project.  Scorsese, a very wealthy director, presumes to make some Big Statement or other about the very wealthy.  And thus he hires a pair of very wealthy actresses to play the female leads; spends a fortune on set-design; employs expensive, up-to-the-minute film technology intended to wow us; spends an inordinate amount of time gazing fondly on an endless parade of expensive ball-gowns, haute cuisine spread upon imported china  (the shad roe with cucumbers looked particularly delicious), chandeliers the size of Christmas trees, gold cigar-clippers, dazzling jewels, impeccable dancing gloves, Chippendale furniture, fur coats, snazzy velvet hats. . . . In other words, *The Age of Innocence*, far from criticizing this milieu, is completely seduced by it.  It's a nauseatingly ostentatious motion picture.",The Age of Innocence

The screenwriter and director both fail in wrenching from this flat tale any kind of riveting or aching longing or heart. So dull is this tale that the characters don't express how they feel, rather some monotonous voice over must explain it to you. Winona Ryder alone stands out as a character; the only one who pines. She alone sees the deceit in the loved ones around her, and though it breaks her heart, she allows it, knowing that she cannot stop them without destroying the lives of everyone she cares for.Pass, pass, pass on this film.

""And do you think there's a limit?""* * Spoilers throughout, I'm afraid. * * Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis), an impeccably eligible bachelor, adornment of New York's high society of the late nineteenth century, is startled to find himself actually caring, deeply, for something outside of the self-imposed strictures of his mapped-out life. How unfortunate, then, that the object is not his dull new fiancée, but his cousin, an altogether rarer creature  and that their kindling mutual attachment sets them apart, threatening to make outcasts of them both. Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) was once plain old Ellen Mingott; now, fleeing her impossible foreign husband, impossibly exotic herself in the tiny, enclosed world of Old New York, she thinks she has found kind old friends and a home, but discovers that they are just another set of impossible shackles. But despite her whiff of the corrupt Old World, Ellen has fresh new ways of looking at and responding to the world around her that work on Newland immediately. Old New York is all style and no substance: its rigours are morbid, obscene, hypocritical, as artificial and constricting as a corset. Nothing can be said or done, or worn, that is not sanctioned by the severe eyes of Society. In this charged atmosphere, in a world so controlled, tiny details (the colour of a flower, a woman's decision to walk across a room) take on depth and intensity (and, of course, have specific consequences). If you don't find the moment at theatre where Ellen refers to Newland's yellow roses unbearably sexually charged, I give you up. Your guide through this complicated world is Joanne Woodward's dry, elegant narrator, the authorial voice of the original novel by Edith Wharton. Themes of innocence are expertly spun throughout this story, no less so by Scorsese than by the book's author. Scorsese keeps his direction tight, subtle, in the background, so as not to swamp a large cast of characters, and a story that needs to be followed attentively. The art direction is brilliant; the costumes magnificent, and the various family homes around which the story centres perfectly reflect the characters of their inhabitants. Day Lewis brings marvellous life to Newland Archer. You feel the power  and panic  of his growing passion, as the predicament into which he has bound himself unfolds itself before him in ever more oppressive detail. Pfeiffer is immensely likable, really inhabiting the skin of the tarnished, elegant, headstrong Ellen. The effect of the chill upon her initiated by events in New York is that of corrupting her innocence. Even charmless Winona Ryder is, unfortunately for her, perfectly cast as May, the pretty, sporty, blank wife of Archer's old dreams, before his eyes were opened. Story and direction alike are really quite subversive: they turn you and turn you, until you feel (don't you?) that true innocence lies in the hearts of the reluctant lovers, and that it is the surface 'innocence' of Old New York, with its prominent families, its subtle manoeuvrings, which is a sham, a corruption, unable to alter itself by so much as a whisker in its staid respectability. A less brave or passionate director would have made a colder, stuffier film, 'faithful' but dull (like May, Newland's fiancée). Scorsese finds the adventure, the emotional pull, the sarcasm and scathing criticism beneath the collected and 'proper' exterior. Wonderful, sad and beautiful, don't be put off by the 'period' label. Terence Davies' adaptation of Wharton's ""The House of Mirth"" is equal in excellence, its star Gillian Anderson a revelation.",The Age of Innocence
72,rowanmaillot,Best Romance Movie,10,27 April 2020,"Each movie Scorsese makes is better than the one before it. He is one of those directors that gets better by the year and that is really all you could ask from a director.*The cinematography and editing in this movie is perfect and beautiful, the dialogue is intelligent and incredibly well-written.*Daniel Day Lewis's performance is in this movie is devastating and we feel for his character.*Scorsese captures the true element of what a character like Newton would go through feeling these thoughts.This almost feels like a homage to Kubrick's Barry Lyndon, mostly the cinematography. Martin Scorsese said the reason he made this movie was because he related to the story, so he felt he was the director for it.It's one of the greatest period pieces and one of the greatest upper-class movies, and one of my personal favourites of the 90's.

73,marcosaguado,A Stunning Law Breaker,10,7 January 2005,"I saw ""The Aviator"" a couple of days ago and while I still have Howard Hughes flying through my brain I felt the need to see again another Scorsese. I have all of his films in my collection. I closed my eyes and picked one, just like that, at random. ""The Age Of Innocence"" This is what happens with great artists, you can always re visit them and you'll come out of the experience with something new, something valuable. Transported by the sublime voice of Joanne Woodward I took the trip again to discover that everything in this extraordinary universe that Martin Scorsese, based on Edith Wharton work, is not what it appears. Conventions out of the window, breaking every imaginable rule. Just as the characters get off their trucks, swimming against the tide of the times. Scorsese breaks cinematic rules with such artistry that we're allow to inspect, re live and enjoy a story as old as the world from a completely new perspective. Is as if Luchino Visconti had suddenly woken up with a new contemporary sight to look back with. Daniel Day Lewis is so marvelous that the pain of his predicament becomes more than visual, becomes visceral. For Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder this was the zenith of their careers. They are sensational. The casting, as usual in a Scorsese film, is superb even in the smallest roles. Glimpses of Sian Phillips, Alexis Smith and Geraldine Chaplin add to the pleasures, making this overwhelming banquet of a film one of the most rewarding film experiences I've ever had.",The Age of Innocence
74,raymond_chandler,One of the 90's Very Best,9,11 August 2001,"********WARNING!!! SPOILERS AHEAD!!!********** ""The Age of Innocence"" is one of the very few films I have ever seen that had me crying at the end. I am a die-hard romantic, and I think Newland's actions were perfectly in character. He had long ago made the choice (you could argue that May made it for him, but that is not true) not to become a social outcast by dissolving his marriage in favor of Ellen, and he stayed true to that decision. To be with Ellen in his later years would be unbearable, for he would be constantly reminded of how much he had lost by not being with her for all those years in between.What makes that final scene so incredibly moving is the memory of the lighthouse and the sailboat, a pivotal scene from earlier in the film. Newland recalls that precise moment in his youth when he let Ellen get away, and it is undoubtedly something he has replayed in his mind countless times. What makes it even more devastating is that Ellen wanted him, but she would not be the one to disrupt the marriage - Newland had to decide for himself. I have never seen a better filmed representation of a person's regret for actions not taken, always more cutting than sorrow over ill-advised actions that were taken. The incredible subtlety with which Scorsese presents this, with just images and music, always blows me away; I consider it one of the classic moments in all of film. For a movie about a society of submerged passion and surface calm, ""The Age of Innocence"" packs an extraordinarily powerful emotional punch.  You may have reservations about the casting or the faithfulness to the book, but as it stands, this is a superb classic of filmed romance.",The Age of Innocence
75,Doogie D,"Astounding, heart wrenching film",10,11 June 1999,"Arguably Scorsese's finest movie to date, fusing the technical perfection of GOODFELLAS and RAGING BULL with an engaging humanity (rather than a brutal one) not usually present in his work.  His meticulous methods service the story of manners and etiquette (not ethics) beautifully.  Jo Anne Woodward's elegant narration -- culled mostly from the novel -- guides us through the society, and the performances of Daniel Day Lewis and Michelle Pfieffer make their increasing frustration and ache so palpable that the lightest touches these two can manage become erotic.  Only one misstep: the old age makeup at the end of the film is rather bad.It's unfortunate that Scorsese took a relative drubbing with this critically and commercially.  I wonder if it isn't what prompted the relative retreat into CASINO, his worst movie to date.  He understands passion other than violence -- I would argue that THE AGE OF INNOCENCE is far more universal than any of his acknowledged masterpieces -- and I'd like to see him continue to visit these other territories, especially when the results are as rich and rewarding as this.",The Age of Innocence
76,thomasmitilis1995,JUST TELL HER I'M OLD-FASHIONED. THAT SHOULD BE ENOUGH...,7,3 June 2020,"PROS:
~Daniel Day Lewis shines playing Newland Archer whose struggle between his passion and his duty are constantly on the verge of devouring him. He feels the oppression by the social structures and in the face of Ellen sees the embodiment of a more bohemian lifestyle. In the end the social obstacles are gone and his wife is dead but realizes that a possible reunification with Ellen is a nostalgic fantasy.
~Michelle Pfeiffer as Ellen is outstanding here (what a woman!!!). Her character is an unconventional woman who doesn't always keeps up with the social rules of the era. She doesn't care if she gets a divorce, she criticizes her surroundings, she doesn't hide from men in the social events and she smokes in front of Newland.
~The chemistry between Lewis and Pfeiffer is tremendous. The way they glance each other in the more intimate scenes and the silence and desperation in their eyes are the highlight of the film.
~Wynona Rider as May Welland is fantastic. She seems as a naive and innocent woman and follows the rules and traditions of the society. However, deep down she understands her husband and succeeds in keeping him close to her.
~The strongest element of the film is the depiction of the upper class in 1870. Martin Scorsese draws constantly parallels between the people and the paintings or theatrical performances indicating that this society is staged and pretentious. A lot of desicions are affected by families that have better prestige and respectable people who loose their fortune, can be confronted with mockery later. Even a visit to a new associate is defined by his profession and identity.
~Scorsese makes a detailed presentation of the upper class and his close-ups on the jewelries, the furnishings, the clothes and the food introduces and immerses the viewer into this pretentious world. The camera often moves beautifully to show the big aristocratic houses which are occasionally the center of crowded events.
~The music score is mesmerising. It is haunting when it should reinforce the romantic tension or gentle when it should show the customs and behaviors of aristocracy.CONS:
~The narration by Joanne Woodward is distracting. She tells unnecessary details for the customs of the wealthy people or the feelings of some characters but at the same time we obviously see all of these things on the screen.
~Another annoying decision is when the characters stare straight into the camera and read their letters directly to the audience breaking as a result the fourth wall.
~The film could be trimmed down some minutes because the story is very simple for this running time. The erotic tension is established preety easily by the two protagonists and as a result a few scenes feel unnecessary (I'm not usually into romantic dramas so maybe I feel the length of the movie because of this).",The Age of Innocence
77,WendyOh!,Beautifully made.,1,20 June 2001,"I saw this recently after seeing Terrance Davies lovely The HouseOf Mirth, and was not disappointed. Actually, they make a nice littleEdith Wharton weekend, if you have a lot of time on your handsand want to feel so good about your own life and choices that youwant to shoot yourself. And I mean that in a good way. This movieis beautifully crafted, and features Winona Ryders bestperformance since Little Women. Daniel Day Lewis has thethankless Edith Wharton male lead role- she wrote best forwomen- and Michelle Pfeiffer is that obscure object of desire. Thisfilm doesn't have the bite and bile that most Scorsese films have,but it's well worth the trip.",The Age of Innocence
78,FreddyShoop,Too stilted...too long...too uninspired.,4,27 September 2004,"Well, I decided to watch this again recently to get a fresh perspective on it. I actually saw this movie in the theatre with some friends, and they all hated it and said it was slow and boring. I defended it at the time, and said they just didn't appreciate its subtleties. However, on second review, it just isn't very good.As the movie is based in the well-heeled society of New York City in the 1870s, you expect it to be a bit dry and formal. Unfortunately, the movie takes it to the extreme.The bottom line theme is that this is a story of a forbidden love of sorts, suppressed by the propriety of the society they live in and the circumstance that finds the parties married to other people. What happens when you find your ""true love"" and it is not the person you are married to...in 1870s NYC...whoops. In modern times, you just get divorced I guess. But at the time, in those social circles, divorce was a taboo that would lead to being ostracized from all the hip parties (and possibly your family). Why that would be a hindrance to ""true love"" I don't know, but it was in this movie.In any event, we get to watch the slow suffering of these estranged lovers over time, but Scorcese never quite hits the emotional vein that makes a tragedy of so long life really captivating to an audience. Unfortunately, Scorcese also takes 2 plus hours to tell us this simple story.Daniel Day Lewis is fantastic per usual, one of the few bright spots. He really captured the essence of a ""proper"" man suffering greatly just underneath the surface. Michelle Pfifer is also good in her role, which Scorcese must have picked her for after a similar role in Dangerous Liasons (a far superior movie). The rest of the cast were so so, because the story and the movie were so so.If you've run out of movies to watch, or want something to fall asleep to, go ahead and give this movie a try. Otherwise, just read the Cliff Notes.",The Age of Innocence
79,AppleBlossom,"An era, never to be seen again.",8,25 January 2003,"I randomly picked this movie to watch, just thinking it would fill my quota of rental movies at that time. I was fascinated by it and hung on every word of the script. The whole production should be applauded. It is set in a gone-by era controlled by codes of conduct and a society status, which were followed by those in the circles of wealth and prestige. I would classify it as a woman's picture, but that's just my opinion. Everything about this film is wonderful, I highly recommend it.",The Age of Innocence
80,Bing-18,A surprise from Scorsese.,8,24 January 2000,"With such a superb novel as a basis, it would take gross incompetence to ruin a movie that is based on it, and Scorsese, though not the obvious choice to direct this movie, is incapable of making a bad movie.Scorsese's direction is ocassionally jumpy, but still superb, although the use of narration can be distracting at times.The revelation in this movie is Pfeiffer's performance as the social outcast, which greatly outstrips that of her co-stars and shows a range in her acting that her previous movies did not allow her to show. The performance of Daniel Day-Lewis as her support and possible lover, is surprisingly uneven and below par, while Winona Ryder does well as the wife of Day-Lewis, despite not getting enough screen-time to develop the character fully.The rest of the support cast including Miriam Margolyes and Alec McGowan, give wonderful performances, either comic or dramatic, and provide the superb backbone on which this film is built.A movie that is beautiful from costume and set-design, to music and scenery, a triumph throughout.",The Age of Innocence
81,ecjones1951,A Magnificent Obsession,9,4 March 2006,"An absolutely beautiful film on every level, from the intelligent acting and direction to the gorgeous production design, inventive editing and elegant musical score. All these elements flow from a screenplay that is respectful of its source and plays by some of its rules: this is certainly not a film for those who like their movies to do all their thinking for them.Leonard Maltin is dead wrong in giving ""The Age of Innocence"" 2 1/2 stars and saying, ""it's hard to connect with these characters on an emotional level."" The blazing eyes of Daniel Day-Lewis; the smoldering, wan glances of Michelle Pfeiffer and the doe-eyed gaze of Winona Ryder just didn't do it for him, huh?Like many other of Martin Scorsese's movies, this one is a love letter to his city, New York. ""The Age of Innocence"" seems to me to be part of a cinematic tour that has made stops in forgotten and uncomfortable places, but when viewed at a remove truly does give us one man's vision of 100 years in the life of New York City.Martin Scorcese has famously called ""The Age of Innocence"" his ""most violent film."" In the context of that remark it begins to make sense that Scorsese is the same man responsible for ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Gangs of New York"" and even ""The King of Comedy."" Customs, societal conventions and mores constrain virtually all of Scorsese's protagonists: Newland, May and Ellen are even more restricted than most, which makes their struggles to live and breathe within those confines all the more powerful. First rate; a film I will watch again and again, and a book I will once again take off the shelf.",The Age of Innocence
82,bob_gilmore1,"Superior, Unique film for the director",10,27 September 2006,"With the release of ""The Departed"" only days away I am sure than many will want to bone up on their Scorsese. If you haven't seen the acclaimed film from 1993 there is no excuse not to dive in and rent, better yet buy it. It ranks right up there with Taxi Driver and Raging Bull in terms of repeat viewing pleasures.I first saw this film on its first run at a Bellevue theater just east of Seattle. As usual for then I was playing Hooke from work and saw it in a virtually empty theater for the noon day showing. Following on the heals of ""Cape Fear"" (One of the director's worst) I was undaunted to see what he had done with the material having read the book in college. This adaptation has the aid of a first rate voice over from Glen Close and since she is ready directly from Edith Wharton's novel one walks away with a two tiered experience. We get the character insight that only a novel can give but the superb cinematography really whisks you away to another time and place. The long tracking shot as our hero enters the long lobby of the mansion hosting the post ballet party reception is stunning, certainly rivaling the prolonged entrance of Henry Hill to the Copa.The only complaints from friends regarding the film is that it is boring. It is only boring to those that have short attention spans and next to the narcolepsy inducing ""Illusionist"" of this year it is positively riveting. No, there are no gangland hits or splattered blood but the cruel way that these rarefied classes deal with out of the box behavior is just is deterministic as Joe Pesci getting ""whacked when he thought he was about to be ""made"" in Goodfellas.The DVD is excellent but it is hoped that Paramount will reissue it with more extras. In terms of just the shear joy of ""looking"" at a film few pictures of that decade matched it for brilliance as that now defunct Age has passed and is all but forgotten.",The Age of Innocence
83,Harold_Robbins,"Lush, Lovely, Lifeless",7,16 December 2007,"Something of a disappointment for me - it was lush and beautiful, yes, and the attention to detail (particularly the food) was perfect (reminding me, in fact, of Bergman's FANNY AND Alexander), but I felt there was too much artifice, too many elaborate, gorgeously-planned camera shots, but no heart - I really didn't care about these people (despite the presence of Alec McCowen, Geraldine Chaplin, Sian Phillips, Michael Gough) and, in her final screen appearance, Alexis Smith), because I had the strange feeling that none of these characters existed outside of the scenes they appeared in, much like the scenes from the opera and play that punctuate the film.I liked it, and won't rule out a re-visit in the future, but I couldn't love it. I admire Scorcese as a film historian - I'll listen to him talk for hours - but I don't like the kind of films he usually makes and thus I avoid them. INNOCENCE is an atypical Scorcese film and that's one reason I wanted to see it (the other being that I like literary period dramas such as this) - the only other films he's directed that I got through were ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE and RAGING BULL (I enjoyed the latter much more than I expected to, finally seeing it only a few months ago) - I walked out of NEW YORK, NEW YORK and AFTER HOURS. I even turned off THE AVIATOR after about half an hour. He was just trying to hard to impress me, I guess. And I've avoided films such as TAXI DRIVER, MEAN STREETS and GOODFELLAS - because from what I've seen of them I know they're not my cup of tea.It's easier for me to watch an Ingmar Bergman film than a Scorcese film.",The Age of Innocence
84,jdoan-4,"Goodfellas, in lavender and lace",9,29 January 2006,"As many have pointed out, it wouldn't seem as though Scorsese would be interested in an 19th century period piece. Yet, I see this film as very similar to ""Goodfellas"". Each catalogue the lives of people who live by a very strict code of conduct. Each has their particular sense of honor and loyalty. Each have methods of dealing with those who step outside the box. In ""Goodfellas"" it is guns and fists (or kitchen knives); in ""The Age of Innocence"" it is gossip and dinner invitations. Both films are rich, elaborate representations of a specific way of life. Scorsese is a filmmaker completely in control of his craft. Every aspect of this film adds an integral part to it. Nothing is incidental or superfluous. The production design in this film is as good as it gets. There is so much detail in every scene. The houses these people live in a founded on the principle of appearances, much like their lives. Everything in them is designed to disguise or distort the truth. I love that fact that the walls are covered, floor to ceiling, with pictures. These people strive to be living portraits, perfect in every visible detail. The music and sound is perfectly suited. There is a bitter loveliness to the score. The classical movement that Scorsese uses is lovely and meaningful. The acting is fantastic. Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the greatest current actors. He gives a very deep and complete performance. I could feel his despair and claustrophobia. Michelle Pieffer is very ironic and cynical. She, like Lewis' character, is a real being trapped in a world of contrived illusion. Ryder's performance is one of the key performances in the film. She is sly and cunning, completely in control of her surroundings. Yet she is able to mask her devilish manipulation as a sweet, shy exterior. I love the narration of the film. It would not have made sense in this film for one of the main characters to narrate, as in ""Goodfellas"". The world in this film is determined by what other people think and say. So it is apropos to have a exterior commentator. Woodward does fine work as the cynical, satirical commentator, exposing the rotten underbelly of this world, and doing it with wily delight. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen. Scorsese never moves his camera without purpose. Each shot is executed for the maximum emotional and cognitive effect. The scenes are edited masterfully. Many times he will cut away right in the middle of a shot to an image that perfectly metaphors the mood and context of the scene. This is one of the most tightly composed films of Scorsese I have seen. I need to watch this film more times. It is very complex. It is a great film.",The Age of Innocence
85,alex-278,"Pretentious , muddled and continual references to ants was annoying",3,11 February 2021,"The narration really does spoil this film. It is pretentious and never achieves the elegance that it aims to. I can see why the director thought it necessary but it so cumbersome and not well written at all. The author is certainly no Jane Austen and the narration should have been rewritten by a more skillful author.One thing I did find hard to take and found very grating was the continual references to Ants, travelling with Ants and and worst of all Anties. You think the Americans could sometimes think about the sensitivities of the international audiences and allow the spelling of the words to influence their pronunciation, otherwise why bother with different spelling and meanings?",The Age of Innocence
86,Marc_Horrickan,Scorsese's Finest Film,10,19 October 2018,"Edith Wharton has been very well served in terms of cinematic adaptations of her work. Terence Davies' delivered a delightfully dark vision of Wharton's THE HOUSE OF MIRTH, and in a similar vein Martin Scorsese reaches the very pinnacle of his much-lauded filmmaking career with this lavish period adaptation, that captures all of the caustic irony and brittle insularity of Wharton's late 19th century New York.Featuring music by Elmer Bernstein and sumptuous Technicolor photography from Michael Ballhaus, this is as detailed and intricate a work as Scorsese has ever made. It is also a very clear passion piece, with three intensely crafted performances at its core. Daniel Day-Lewis is beautifully sincere and agonised as the aristo caught inside the tenderest of traps - it now looks like a dry-run for his similarly masochistic Reynolds Woodcock, in THE PHANTOM THREAD. Michelle Pfeiffer is as close to perfection as an actress could get as Ellen Olenska, the cultured European who no longer belongs in New York society, but utterly depends on it for succour. Then there is Winona Ryder's delicate work as May Welland, which could easily disappear from view when considering the quality of the two leads, but Ryder complements things beautifully with a cunning innocence that is the very image of power and privilege.Probably the most stunning aspect of the film is the rich production design from Dante Ferretti, which manages to bring together Scorsese's cinephilic reference points, with meticulous period detail, making for a subtle and devastatingly beautiful period costume drama.",The Age of Innocence

It has been in rather heavy rotation on the movie channels for some reason of late, and I watched it again a few weeks ago.  It simply left me breathless.  I must have watched it twelve times over the last few weeks, and am dying to buy the DVD if it ever comes out.  Scorcese calls this his ""most violent film"", and after seeing it again, alone, watching intently, it struck me how completely right he was.The comments before mine are mostly right on target...I am in awe of the filmmaking and can't say enough about the dramatic subtleties, the opulent production values and the overall magnificent way the entire project was handled.  Even the normally atrocious Winona Ryder excelled in a role that was simply a tour-de-force for her...the vapid but yet not so vapid after all May Welland.  A masterpiece.

My problem was that the background actors in this movie tend to be more of a background than the implied oppression of desires and need for formality which these type of people in this story use to hold themselves bereft of everything (including themselves it seems!)

89,BaileySEA,"A meticulous, beautifully made film, beautiful to look at.",10,14 April 2005,"When Martin Scorsese deigned to adapt Edith Wharton's novel ""The Age of Innocence"" for the big screen he obviously saw it as a highly stylized period piece. THE AGE OF INNOCENCE is a meticulous, beautiful film with glowing production values and a pallet of production techniques not seen since CITIZEN KANE. Although a stunningly beautiful film to watch, the story detracts from the Edith Wharton novel. The narration by Joanne Woodward is jarring at first, yet gives the modern viewer an idea of 1870's New York City mores. Daniel Day-Lewis plays Newland Archer with strong conviction and virtue. Michelle Pfeiffer's performance as Countess Olenska seems a bit modern in this otherwise fine period piece. Scorsese's camera deftly flows through ballrooms and mansions effortlessly, giving the film a broader scope visually. I watch this film over and over when I need a break from the mundane films that are pumped out on an assembly line known as Hollywood. Although lacking in story and substance at times, it has some great supporting players, such as Brits Miriam Margolyes, Michael Gough, Jonathan Pryce, Sian Phillips,and of course a wonderful bit by the great Alec McCowen as the snobbish aesthete Sillerton Jackson.

Unequalled aesthetic experience from the very beginning (title sequence by masters Elaine and Saul Bass) to the very end, with the film dedicated by the director to his father Luciano Charles Scorsese.You will not find Scorsese's gangsters and killings here... or will you? The most violent act is that of a hand putting a letter on a silver tray (and this can be very violent, in fact), or a quiet man lighting a cigarette during a conversation, or the main character (Daniel Day-Lewis) looking at the hat of his rival. Everything played by extraordinary actors and actresses like Siân Phillips, Geraldine Chaplin, Norman Lloyd, Richard E. Grant, Alexis Smith or Michael Gough, not to mention the leading roles (the presence of two beauties like Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder might be a just too evident warning of the special qualities of this film).You have not lived until you have heard the voice of Joanne Woodward narrating the story by Edith Wharton: subtlety, irony, sorrow. Only a person with a rich experience of life could talk like that, with such depth. The Spanish version had the voice of Nuria Espert, a veteran Catalan actress: a right choice. Unfortunately, the version showed on Catalan TV had the voice of a young woman (of course, I expected Espert or any other among many excellent Catalan actresses of similar age) and although that young actress did her best, the narration was not the same: the burden of life is necessary in the voice telling such a tragic story.Sublime music by Elmer Bernstein, exquisite photography by Michael Ballhaus, expert editing by Thelma Schoonmaker, production design by master Dante Ferretti... and of course Scorsese's long traveling shots, color flashes, and a lesson on the possibilities of cinema: everything in this film is aesthetic perfection, unappreciated by many viewers who perhaps miss subtle details or don't feel the overall harmony of such a unique masterpiece.10 out of 10 with no doubt.

The couple is always prevented by such obstacles as society, class, fame, family, etc. Although the story written by Edith Wharton is set in an early 20th Century New York City upper class, we, living in the present days, are also surrounded by the same or the other obstacles in some situations.Some scenes are picturesque; when Newland Archer watches Ellen on the back on the seashore, she does not notice him and watches a beautiful barque passing by and she does not turn her head though he wants her to do so; after Ellen was informed that Archer's wife, May (Winona Ryder) was pregnant, she pretends to be calm, says good-bye to Newland, supported by their acquaintances who know everything about their hidden feeling, and departs by a carriage with the pale face; in the last scene, old Newland is dazzled by the sun light reflected on a window of Ellen's apartment her maid tries to close, and is reminded of the seashore scene where, however, Ellen notices him and turns her head in his imagination.In this film, we often see people eat at beautifully decorated tables and with refined tableware, and Scorsese seems to highlight those meal scenes.Daniel Day-Lewis well performs the elegance and intelligence of Newland Archer, and Michelle Pfeiffer skilfully expresses Ellen's state of mind. Winona Ryder is young, pure and innocently pretty. Furthermore, Joanne Woodward's narration and Elmer Bernstein's music are also keys to add more taste to the film.I would like to recommend you to see Scorsese's another world!",The Age of Innocence
96,conono,"Ramp it up, Mr Scorcese?",6,12 May 2007,"It's worth mentioning at the outset that I am a complete Martin Scorcese fan; however I do not agree with an apparent consensus here that this is among his best films.For me, the biggest hurdle is the (mis)casting of the endlessly effete Daniel Day-Lewis in the lead role. So: if you like Daniel Day-Lewis, you may well love the film--he's in nearly every scene. For my part, I find him almost unbearable to watch, never more so than here. It's hard to imagine him as an object of desire, even in this period piece. And saddling his character with feminist political philosophy, while it may enhance his appeal to some viewers, is a stretch from the novel's characterization and quite anachronistic besides.However, the other leads are notably fine (especially Michelle Pfeiffer and even the endlessly variable Winona Ryder) and there are knockout performances in the supporting roles, particularly Siân Phillips, Jonathan Pryce and Miriam Margolyes.Otherwise, the film's pacing is the problem. The film is simply overlong; boring and tedious at times (and I'm a person who loves Bergman), although never less than stunning visually. That last fact alone carried me through several scenes. It's a treat to look at, no doubt about that. And if you like period films, decoration, and fashion, so much the better for you.Scorcese has done better, though. Much better.",The Age of Innocence
97,rejoefrankel,One of the most visually lavish films ever made.,10,16 February 2000,"Martin Scorsese's underrated AGE OF INNOCENCE ranks with CITIZEN KANE,and LAST YEAR AT MARIENBAD as one of the most visually lush, lavishly produced films ever made.  Stylistically it is a tour de force.  Daniel Day Lewis, Wynona Ryder and Michelle Pfeiffer all shine, in this psychologically comlex film that has the energy and pace of Scorsese's most feverish gangster films.  My personal vote for greatest costume drama of the screen.  It is subtly sinful and sexy, with just enough suggestion to please 90's film goers.  A compelling work from start to finish.",The Age of Innocence
98,wezzel,Beautiful movie,8,13 August 2002,"Martin Scorsese directing a period piece. That kinda sounds like Slipknot guest appearing on the new Celine Dion album. What's amazing about this movie is that he almost pulls it off. Visually, this is one of the most stunning movies I've ever seen. Look at the shot where Michelle Pfeiffer is standing on a peer, looking at a ship. Or the rain scene, that used Enya's Marble Halls. Sheer perfection, the director as a painter. But what's the most amazing about Age of Innocence are the colors. It's really hard to explain, it's something you have to experience yourself. Unbelievably beautiful.Unfortunately, not everything works. The story, another tragic tale of impossible love, has been done thousands of times before and didn't really hold my attention. Not bad, just more time to watch the pretty pictures. Anyway, I don't think Scorsese was really interested in the love story. It's more an analytical study of the behavior of people from that day and age, and as such it does work Daniel Day-pri Lewis ( a bundle of joy he is not) is perfectly cast as the frustrated Archer, but the actingprizes have to go to Michelle Pfeiffer. What a beautiful woman, what an amazing actress.Rating: 8/10",The Age of Innocence
99,sundog1,Scorsese's Ignored Masterpiece,10,14 November 2003,"I actually saw this movie when it was released in 1993, and honestly it was pretty dull then. Of course I was 22, and the workings of that late-1800's New York society really didn't make much sense or have much relevance.I think the film may have been ignored at its release because of the slew of other ""period pieces"" which were so popular (an eventually common) in the late 80's/early 90's... But watching it again 10 years later, this film is anything but common.The true intensity is Scorcese's detached presentation of a hypocritical & hateful society which holds its members as prisoners.Not to mention impeccable art direction & beautiful cinematography by the legendary Michael Ballhaus. The film looks as impressionistic as the paintings that line the walls of the characters' homes.Scorsese is always acute in his casting decisions, and this is one of the films many virtues:Lewis is perfect as a man who's struggle between his passion & his duty are constantly on the verge of devouring him  (yet somehow he thrives on his torture).Ryder is the seemingly innocent & naive girl who is completely manipulative & cunning underneath her exterior (gee, who would have thought?!) -- notice the arching scene.In a sense, this was one of Pfeiffer's defining roles. Pfeiffer herself (in a sense) is an ""outcast"" who has never truly been accepted as a ""serious"" actress by her peers in the acting community. Watching this film again, it amazes me how this role somehow reflects her personal position in the current social structure of Hollywood, similar to her character existing in 1800's New York society.Wow...What an amazing pic. I completely ""missed it"" the first time around. Great observance of ""high society."" Many of those codes are strangely applicable today.Not recommended for those who like fast paced movies, or those who are looking for the ""usual Scorcese.""  I would couple this with ""Last Temptation of Christ"" as Scorsese's most brave, artistic, demanding & abstract films to date.",The Age of Innocence

Looks beautiful? Check. So with all that where does the film go wrong?And that would be the plot. This story plays out over two long hours. To call it a slow burn would be an understatement. There exists so little tension in this film that the conflicting interests are just left to dangle in the wind. When we finally see the resolution to the problem you're left saying 'That's it?'.Throw me in the same group as the bro's disappointed with Marty for making 'Goodfellas' and then releasing this dull period piece. Sorry, but I expected more given all the praise this gets on the Internet.",The Age of Innocence
101,bt-wells99-1,"Shamefully underrated, subtly brilliant.",9,27 March 2010,"Scorcese is the greatest. Even his films that fail do so with the most admirable of intentions. This is not one of those. One of his best films of the nineties, second only to the monolithic achievement of Goodfellas, this is an altogether different kind of Scorcese film, an understated, beautiful piece of film-making.The way to enjoy this film is to look out for the implicit violence threatening always to break out into this horrific world of upper middle class intrigue. The vile backstabbing of old New York society feels as realistically portrayed as the other New York we normally associate Scorcese with. We are truly transported into this era - the director being significantly aided by some truly incredible performances. Daniel Day Lewis, who is without a doubt the best film actor in the world, certainly of the last 20 or so years, is predictably excellent, but this film really belongs to its women. Michelle Pfeiffer is stunning, as is the oft-derided Winona Ryder in a career-best performance of astonishing depth.I have watched this film many times, less often perhaps than the more obvious entertaining crowd pleaser films Marty has made his name making, but every time I watch it I discover something new. The action is slow, it requires patience, but this film will, if you let it, reward you in spades. Highly recommended to anyone who isn't put off by period costumes and old-fashioned dialogue, or anyone who likes Scorcese but has let this gem pass them by.",The Age of Innocence
102,sksolomonb,The Age of Hypocrisy,10,21 December 2019,"I would like to point out some things about ""The Age of Innocence"" which most reviewers have not mentioned. Edith Wharton's book and the film deal with the era depicted in the novels of Henry James, a time when the noble class of European society had lost its wealth and influence due to changes in government and society caused by the decimating European wars of the 19th century. At the same time, the rising working and middle classes of Europe, thanks to the Industrial Revolution and international trade and colonialism, heralded the breakdown of the rural-based feudal system that for centuries had made the nobles and monarchs wealthy and powerful. In many cases, all the nobles had were their titles, their crumbling ancestral homes, and the desire to be ""top dog"" again. In desperation, they looked to the nouveau riche class of northeastern America, the Americans who had become rich from the Industrial Revolution and from supporting and winning the American Civil War in 1865. At the same time, the nouveau riche of America wanted the culture and titles of the European nobility and, as result, emulated the rigid, unforgiving European class system.Time moves on to 1870, and one meets the gentle and helpless Ellen Olenska who has fallen Into a web of intrigue spun by her ambitious nouveau riche relatives They have squandered Ellen's life by making her the ""sacrificial lamb"" and using her marriage to Count Olenska as the ticket for their ""ego trip."" When the count proves to be an abusive husband and a faithless womanizer, Ellen is encouraged to stay in the marriage and ""make it work"" so that the family's ego trip can continue without scandal.When Ellen returns to New York, everyone knows the marriage has failed, and the family treats Ellen as the ""loser"" who could not make the marriage work. In short, the relatives consider her a disgrace and a disappointment. How dare Ellen be unhappy over something that the family wants?Another victim caught in the web is Newland Archer, a patent attorney who has become wealthy through writing, registering, and safeguarding the patents on new inventions and machinery vital to the Industrial Revolution. As a result, the expansion of industry and increasing mechanization and innovation dramatically change every day life as the American economy moves from the agricultural base of the pioneer era. Needless to say, the new industrial base of the American economy ushers in a progressive or modern way of life. The people on the ground floor of this change, such as Newland and his peers, are the new elite -- the leaders and captains of industry -- and the rich only get richer.After Newland meets Ellen, he becomes torn between the prospect of an arranged marriage to May Welland and his feelings for Ellen, who is May's older cousin. The arranged marriage has been promoted by the Welland and Archer families, who have intimidated Newland to some extent. He struggles throughout intermittent bouts of sympathy he feels toward Ellen, a woman whose needs were not met in an arranged marriage that failed and cast her aside as ""damaged goods."" Should he marry the much younger and seemingly innocent May, or should he marry Ellen, a woman closer to his age, and offer her a second chance at love, children, and happiness?The dilemma Newland faces reminds me of the similar crisis in ""Anna Karenina"" by Leo Tolstoy. Anna is an unhappy woman, married to Karenin, a man old enough to be her father. Long gone is the time when Karenin was in his prime and young-looking enough to attract the infatuation of the very young Anna. The marriage has produced a son, but Anna is too bored by her life with Karenin to care.Anna tries to find fulfillment as a mentor and ""older sister"" figure to her young niece Kitty. Anna cheerfully attends the engagement party of Kitty and Count Vronsky, but the mood changes when Anna is attracted to the handsome and charming Vronsky, who is near her age. In so many words, Anna thinks, ""I should have married someone like this instead of an old man.""In 19th- century Russia, the setting of Tolstoy's works, every milestone in life was considered a spiritual or sacred event accompanied by a Russian Orthodox church service rich in ritual. Imagine the shock when Anna and Vronsky fall in love -- or lust -- during the engagement party and run away to carry on their romance, live together, and to have a child?In Tolstoy's novel, Anna is the villain who has broken society's rules and who is punished in the end. In Edith Wharton's novel, Newland marries the virginal May Welland and becomes the dutiful father of their children while pretending to be happy. However, for the rest of his life, he is tormented by guilt over his lack of commitment, his failure to ""do right"" by marrying Ellen for love, and to fall short of achieving his own fulfillment. Whether Newland made the right choice in the long run is up to the individual reading the novel and/or seeing the film.",The Age of Innocence
103,chains01,Age of Innocence,8,14 May 2010,"In 19th century New York high society, Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is engaged to the conventional May Welland (Winona Ryder). Things start to change for Newland when May's cousin, the unconventional Dutchess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), moves to New York following the separation of her and her Polish Count husband. As Newland helps her through legal matters Newland begins to fall in love with her, and begins to question his relationship with May.Martin Scorsese had been considering making a romance for years, but could never seem to find the right project. Then in 1980 screenwriter Jay Cocks gave Scorsese a copy of Edith Wharton's book The Age of Innocence saying, ""When you do that romantic piece, this one is you."" Seven years later, Scorsese finally read the book and decided to make the movie. Not only did he make the movie, he got his first choice for the three leads in the cast.This movie gives an interesting look into the gossipy nature of old school high society New York. Through the narration of the movie you really feel like you're being thrust into the middle of these people's lives. You hear the gossip, see the backstabbing, and deal with the ""rules"" of residing in high society. It's because of the toying with emotions and backstabbing that occurs in high society that Scorsese said this is the most violent movie he ever made.In high society it's only natural that people will hide their true feelings beneath the surface, and here the actors due a superb job at exemplifying that trait. Daniel Day-Lewis is superb as a the man torn between his fiancé and her cousin, but trying to hide it from the world. Michelle Pfeiffer is amazing as the woman who catches Newland's heart with her unorthodox behavior. But it's Winona Ryder who steals the show. As May, she plays a character who acts clueless, but underneath she's broken by what's going on and plotting to keep her husband.If you like period dramas or Scorsese films I highly recommend this film. To be honest, I wasn't exactly sure how I felt about this movie when I was first done watching this, but in the time since I've thought about it and I have to admit that I'm definitely going to be watching it again. Scorsese definitely scored another masterpiece with this '93 period romance.4/5",The Age of Innocence
104,pablobiedma,Scorsese's most serene work,8,12 March 2021,"This is, the way I see it, Scorsese's most serene and calmed work in the sense it lacks this energizing, sometimes crazy, unconventional, or uncontrolled element that most of his movies have. For that reason, I think that in that sense, this is his most ""perfect"" film, and I am thankful for it.As we all know, Scorsese loves cinema and especially classic movies. He lets this show in ""The age of innocence"" probably in more than any of his previous movies. I say this because this movie could remind us of a Max Ophuls film for the following reasons:-Ophuls (almost) always made period films, also around the 1900s
-He is also well known for his slow pace and outstanding cinematography
-In movies like ""The Earrings of Madame De..."" he films amazing scenes at the Opera just like Scorsese did.
-Even when Daniel Day-Lewis goes to Europe he meets a person who takes him to a restaurant and says ""This restaurant is so nice, Maupassant recommended it to me"" Maupassant wrote the stories in which Ophuls's film ""Le Plaisir"" is based.While the similarities are obvious, it's more of an inspiration or a tribute, there wasn't a single time in which Scorsese attempted to imitate Ophuls because he knew it was impossible. The cinematography in Ophuls is out of his reach, better long takes, better production design, camera movement...
In all moments Scorsese kept his own style with fast editing, his typical narration etcetera, which is a good thing to do.
In fact, at the beginning of the movie, when the narrator introduces the characters with the voice in off, it looks like if he was introducing all the members of the mob in Goodfellas, Casino, or any of his movies.
His style made this movie more modern and easier to watch for its time.Daniel Day-Lewis gives a brilliant performance as well.
While at the beginning I said that this is the more serene or calmed Scorsese film, one thing that seems strange to me is that at some times Scorsese seems to be holding himself back, he seems to be forcing the slow pace like he had something else he wanted to tell us in a perhaps more energetic manner but couldn't do it. A similar thing happens to Daniel Day-Lewis in his performance. They both look a bit forced, but they are both great.Another brilliant moment in this film is the way the third act ends. The scene in the flower shop is amazing. The way it's edited so that the audience can recognize the protagonist's actual intentions and what'll drive him during the rest of the movie. The moment he buys flowers for his fiance but also for her cousin.",The Age of Innocence
105,carcar-759-676336,Expresses true pain in hypocrisy,7,12 July 2012,"This tale is gripping, tantalizing and intriguing. However, it is very sad. Essentially the main characters work against what their gut, what their heart tells them to. In the end they choose blending in with the crowd to live bland, fake lives. They live in hypocrisy out of fear of what others will think. You watch in hopes they will do themselves a favor, but they never do. Behind the scenes they desire to live in truth, but they never do, which leaves for a miserable and empty ending that favors ""duty"" above all else. It is extremely painful to watch all the opportunities that Newland could have taken to get out of the lie he was living... that he either misses or attempts to take too late. He is engaged, he can get out of it, because he is miserable and loves someone else... but he denies it. He gets married and has many an opportunity early on to admit to himself before it's too late that he's made a mistake. When you get to a point when you wish your wife would catch a death of cold and die, you know things are going wrong. Then ... May gets pregnant. At risk of being a jerk, he gives up on the idea of letting May go. He loves his children, grows to love and miss May, but in the end he knows still that his life is blending in and based on lies. He has one final opportunity after May has passed on (even encouraged by his son) to UNDER HONEST CIRCUMSTANCES see if she would give him a chance, but he would rather remember how she was than see how she is and give himself a chance at honest happiness. How would I describe it overall? Heartbreaking.",The Age of Innocence

Mr. Scorcese's style and panache is elaborate in his film adaptation of Edith Wharton's moving novel of a forbidden love and the desideration between the two.  Pfeiffer gives the most heart-wrenching performance as the object of desire. Daniel Day Lewis, equally talented, is the tortured lover who must choose, a promise of marrige to Mae (Winona Ryder) or risk his stalwart reputation in society to express his love for Pfeiffer.

New York's 'good' society, revolving around the few founding families, is a caricature of its European cousins. Amidst fossilized social customs, etiquette and religious rites mixed with hardly disguised money-based power struggles, freedom of speech, freedom of thought and freedom to control one's own life are not an option. Newland Archer will have no choice but to marry May Welland even though he is desperately in love with the beautiful Countess Olenska. But to break an engagement between two influential families would be a fight Newland does not feel the courage to start. Especially since Countess Olenska would have to divorce first! ""We advocate democracy and freedom, we don't practice them"", says Newland. Child of this society, he will bear with his suffering and will never change his course even when Fortune gives him other chances. Incredible as it may seem, it must have been true.

111,elaurens88,An exquisite film,10,21 April 2001,"This is one of the greatest films ever made.  Each frame aches with repressed passion and longing. It is about a lawyer named Newland Archer (played expertly by Daniel Day-Lewis) who yearns to break free of the rigid, repressive world of upper-class New York in the 1870's.  The tragedy is that he cannot quite bring himself to do this, for fear of losing the security and prestige that this world offers him.  As Countess Olenska, Newland's forbidden lover, Michelle Pfeiffer has never been better and Winona Ryder is equally strong as Newland's fiancee, May, who hides a controlling, manipulative nature behind a veil of sweetness and naivete.  Jay Cocks' screenplay is a true rarity - a script that is stimulating emotionally as well as intellectually.  The dialogue shines, just click on the ""memorable quotes"" section of the sidebar for a sampling of this script's greatness. And how could I forget the master behind this masterpiece, Martin Scorsese? His direction is peerless, as always.  His camera is always moving, but the effect is stylish and subtle rather than intrusive.  The framing and composition are exquisite as well.  One of my favorite things about this film is it's look.  The cinematography (Michael Ballhaus), art direction (Dante Ferretti), and costumes (Gabriela Pescucci) magically recreate the visual splendor of the era.   This film will hold you spellbound until its last scene, which is one of the most heartbreaking and poignant in cinematic (and literary) history.

Watching Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder in a love triangle is a treat, the costumes are sumptuous, the sets spectacular, and the ending is a heartbreaker. Forgive them if they're sometimes too subdued; suffice to say, there's a lot of suppressed emotion churning around inside all three. It's all very muted, very subtle, and a master class in acting. Kudos as well to the steady hand of director Martin Scorsese; he establishes a stately tone early on, and never abandons it. If you've read the Edith Wharton novel but have never seen it brought to life onscreen, see it now. If you have seen it, see it again.

113,muerco,sublime,9,2 March 2007,"I can't recommend this movie highly enough--to Scorsese fans or non-Scorsese fans. It is, I think, the best costume picture I have ever seen. OK, ""The Leopard"" is greater, and ""Barry Lyndon"" might also be, but what company! The book is of course wonderful source material, but that doesn't guarantee greatness as a film; and the film has a sensuality, a tactile, flowing quality, that is utterly remarkable. Every vase on the bureau, painting on the wall, teapot on the table seems to have been chosen with meticulous care, and the whole thing feels lived in too; the camera roams the walls or the gallery at the opera the way our eyes might. Sublime. This is what I was hoping for when Scorsese labored for years on ""Gangs""--a lovingly detailed, completely sensual immersion in the past. Didn't happen that time. But why this movie isn't on the shortlist of great literary adaptations I will never understand. It's a master filmmaker at his most fluid, and (as another reviewer on IMDb presciently put it) Visconti-like.I first saw this film at its (world?) premiere at the Venice Film Festival in 1993. As just a normal plebe, I couldn't score a ticket for the daytime screening on the Lido, but as I waited to see something else I saw the European cinejournalists coming out, all looking nonplussed. I talked to a few of them, and all of them said it was boring and offered criticism along the lines of ""he just filmed the book"". Nonetheless, I went later that week to an outdoor nighttime screening for the public at the Campo Santo Stefano (if I'm not mistaken), and from the opening shots of the blooming flowers across that widescreen space, I was truly captivated. But I must admit that I didn't fully trust my feelings about the film--the later American reviews seemed to echo the ones of the Euro journalists, and I wondered if it was seeing this film so far from home in a foreign location that had made it so vivid for me. But I saw it again about 12 years later and it came into focus just how great it really is, critics be damned. This is a film that gets better and better with age, especially since we're not surrounded by Merchant/Ivory style films like we were then, or rather nowadays they've all been Weinsteined into star vehicles for Gwyneth or Keira. Just as in that wonderful earlier comment on this thread by Jess Fink, I am happy/sad to see the film get so much love on this board. I had assumed there were so few of us, and we'd have 40 years in the wilderness before the world would catch on.Day-Lewis is terrific, as is most of the supporting cast, but the reason I can't give this a perfect 10--the only flaws I can think of--are the performances of the leading ladies. Pfeiffer has some good moments, but I think she is unable to fully carry off the complexity of the role. On second viewing, Ryder's performance seemed less stiff than I remembered from the initial viewing, but I do think she's also a little overmatched by the incredible actors around her. She makes a good effort though.A terrific film that will help round out your understanding of this great director.",The Age of Innocence
114,Builders,Can't recreate Wharton's novel.,5,21 July 2005,"I am sad to say that this movie, while beautifully filmed, has little of the interest of Edith Wharton's novel. Why is this? First, because we can't get into the soul of Newland Archer, as Wharton does, to understand his secret cravings and fears. While Mr. Lewis tries admirably, this movie is just not a vehicle for the expression of mens' inner visions, as Wharton provides with her written words. (See her Ralph Marvel character in ""Custom of the Country"" for inner visions.)The second reason is that the persona of Ellen Olenska is not developed in a way that makes her compellingly attractive. To me, Madam Olenska of the novel is a dark enigma, at the same time impetuous and patient, plain and yet beautiful, fair, honest, compassionate, compromised and yet virtuous, strong willed and yet vulnerable, possessing her own style, self-effacing, but not ashamed. She is a person who seeks to satisfy her own desires but is also willing to sacrifice all for those she loves. Newland Archer becomes hooked on her integrity. The Ellen of the movie doesn't portray the powerful, exotic, alluring presence of Wharton's Ellen.I agree with those who take exception to the screenplay, and think it could have been better adapted to the screen venue, more oriented toward character expression.I wonder about the casting decisions to embody Ellen with Ms. Pheiffer's light hair and complexion, and wide features, and to portray May with Ms. Ryder's dark hair and smaller person, reversing their personal qualities from the novel. While a delight for the eyes, this film misses the essence of the tale.",The Age of Innocence

Why he has not lifted the golden statue for a movie is unbelievable. This movie is stylish, classy and the costumes are wonderful. I love the way a movie looks. Staged in the late 1800's the passion in which Scorsese crafted the motion picture is beyond me. Daniel Day-Lewis and Michelle Pfeiffer are deeply in love but they never kiss, they touch each others hand once for he is engaged to Winona Ryder.

116,alvoalvo,Scorsese's ode to individuality!,10,11 June 2001,"I have seen ""The Age of Innocence"" about 15 times since 1994, and find the argument as to whether it is boring or not to be fascinating. Period films are not for everyone, and if you lack an appreciation for subtlety then maybe something like ""Joe Dirt"" may be better suited for you. But what lies beneath this wonderful movie is a priceless ode to individuality.Michelle Pfeiffer plays Ellen Olenska, a proto-feminist who flees from her failing European marriage to the home of her blood relatives in 1870's New York Society. She's been away for most of her life and the States are foreign to her, but she quickly realizes that she is viewed as threat, a black sheep ---and Society reacts to her as it would to a dirty black spot on a carpet or on one of their tuxedo shirts. ""Harmony could be shattered by a whisper"", as well narrated by Joanne Woodward.Daniel Day-Lewis plays Newland Archer, an up-and-rising patriarch who sees something in her that no one else in his rich circle could offer him: an independent viewpoint to life. As a lawyer and a powerful member of his family, he bravely tries to protect Ellen from basically everyone, esp. members of their own family. Despite all of her difficulties, Countess Olenska refuses to part from her individuality: she smokes in front of Newland, does not hide from men in social situations, and criticizes her surroundings. Archer doesn't necessarily fall in love with her as a person but with what she represents: Romanticism and escape.There is a lot to love about this film, which is more like a piece of art than a movie. Every scene and every bit of dialogue denotes elegance and brutality simultaneously. All of the leading and supporting characters are so believable and well formed that they trump anything Hollywood has been throwing at us in recent months. And the setting for this film is very unconventional, at least for the 90's. Through excellent film-making, I can see why Society felt the need to operate in such a ruthless fashion, in order to protect itself from Ellen and what she represented to Newland, its newly crowned prince.Over the past few months, I have also grown an appreciation for Winona Ryder's performance as May. She is a shrewd politician, who uses her ""bright blindness"" as a megaphone for Society's rules of conduct, a weapon of manipulation against her destined husband Newland, and as a way to continue plotting without easily being detected.I wonder how many more times I will watch ""The Age of Innocence"" before I risk being exposed to Hollywood's 21st century conformity, such as ""Independence Day"" or ""Wild, Wild West"". All I know is that Ellen Olenska (as one of my favorite cinematic heroines) serves to validate my own sense of individuality, and neither she nor the astonishing beauty of this Scorcese creation, will ever be boring. 10 out of 10 stars.",The Age of Innocence
117,mdc_geo,Such a Disappointment,4,12 August 2011,"Based on a novel that revolves around desire vs. convention, this film leaves out all desire. Michelle Pfeiffer is horrible, straight out of the 20th Century as Ellen Olenska. There is no trace of the foreign, no element of the European anywhere in her character. None of the introspection or suffering that defines the character of Madam Olenska. Similarly, Daniel Day Lewis is stiff and completely unconvincing as a man torn apart by desire vs. duty. Winona Ryder is simple, plain, and utterly forgettable.The beauty in the film comes from the majestic houses and the beautiful objects that convey status and money. The narration is beautifully done and serves to adeptly move the story forward. Scorsese or not, this film is a flop.",The Age of Innocence
118,mmt02,Excellent Period Piece Shows the Genius of Scorcese,9,25 May 1999,"One could watch Age of Innocence with the volume off and still be amazed. As in all his films, Scorcese uses his camera to paint a portrait of the space and condition that his characters move in. The fluid camera movement shows the audience the beautiful rooms and costumes of the late 19th century New York society. Scorcese also pays close attention to the mechanics of the society; we can watch the meat being carved and the cigars being clipped and lit. Just as in Goodfellas, we watch how the mob works from the inside, Age of Innocence lets us watch the inner workings of this scoiety. Of course there are the stylistic techniques that Scorcese is famous for. The way he darkens part of the screen and focuses on Daniel Day-Lewis and Michelle Pfeiffer in one scene at the opera is further proof of his genuis as a film maker. Visual excellence combined with great performances and an interesting narrative makes Age of Innocence a must see for anyone interested in great films.",The Age of Innocence

Michelle Pfeiffer was great, as was the rest of the cast. The visuals in the film were also wonderful, not a detail was spared. But this was not enough to make up for the lack of chemistry between Pfeiffer and Lewis, which made the ""lost love"" theme fall flat. I also really disliked the voice over - the narrator had an overly sweet intonation most of the time, which I found distracting and grating. I'm very surprised everyone loved it. I've watched many a period romance,and this one is at the bottom of the heap.",The Age of Innocence
120,OnlyRocknRoll,Evoking an era,9,7 December 2005,"I love films that do such an excellent job of evoking a bygone era. Not simply ""costume"" but also mood, mores. It tells a story of a period of U.S. history about which I think most contemporary U.S. citizens are ignorant. Truly, how many out there know the history of the Dutch in the U.S. or even that New York was first New Amsterdam? The screenplay/dialogue is very faithful to Edith Wharton's novel. Another huge plus as I detest rampant rip-offs of literature.Despite anachronisms pointed out on this site, I can only find one major flaw in the film: The choice of narrator. Whatever her talents as an actress, Ms. Woodward, after 40+ years, still retains traces of her Georgia accent which simply DO NOT GO WITH a story about New York in the 1890's. If it were possible, I would re-dub the film with the voice of Linda Hunt. No traceable accent, excellent diction, and intriguingly androgynous.",The Age of Innocence

Any serious film student who really wants to learn how to make a film needs to watch Scorsese films.  He was originally given this novel in 1980 by a former TIME critic who told him ""it's guilt and conscience - the definitive Scorsese.""  This movie is the exact kind of romantic, class driven drama that TITANIC wishes it was.  If there is any actor alive who can possibly compare to the magnificent repression and passion combined in one that Laurence Olivier used to show us, it is Daniel Day-Lewis.  Here he comes fully into his own, bringing the character of Newland Archer alive. This is also where Winona Ryder finally comes into her own as an actress. Anyone who loves movie about the classes, about romance, about guilt, or simply anyone who loves movies should be heading to a video store to rent this one right away.",The Age of Innocence
122,khnumber8,Interesting but constipated movie,6,10 January 2014,"Best actor in this film?? Joanne Woodward (she was the narrator !!) I honestly mean this... her narration was just great, she had the perfect inflection in her voice at all times. Daniel Day Lewis did a fine acting job as usual, but NOT GREAT. There was virtually no variation in his performance... he was the same stick-up-the-arse character all the time. As for Michelle Phiffer, she was her usual self, nothing spectacular. I actually thought Winona Rider gave the best performance of the three ""leads"". She was totally believable and had just the right nuances at the right time.As for the movie... it certainly is interesting as a period piece and repressed/suppressed love story, but Martin Scorsese makes his usual mistake as a director of this film.... he hits one note, emotionally, and keeps hitting and hitting and hitting and hitting this note for the entire picture. It's tiresome, redundant, and frustrating for the viewer. The ""note"" of this film is unactualized love and socially ""necessitated"" repressed behavior. I wanted to say: OK, OK !!! I get it, let's move on to some other things... subplots, variations in behavior among the main characters, SOMETHING, ANYTHING.Some people have remarked that this film is a departure for Scorsese. I think not.... his thing is beating a dead horse.",The Age of Innocence
123,allamericanpsycho21,Beauty of Innocence,8,11 November 2007,"Going into The Age of Innocence, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. Martin Scorsese has been one of my favorite directors for some time now yet this is a film that I have always put off watching. To me, looking at the cover box and watching the trailer, I expected little more than beautiful eye candy with three attractive stars. What exactly could Scorsese bring to the issue of high society in the 1800's that hasn't been already addressed? As it turns out, quite a bit.With The Age of Innocence, Scorsese plays against type (if doing so as a director is possible) and dives straight into a genre that he is both not well known for as well as not directly familiar with. His lavish art direction and assured directing help make a familiar tale of doomed love breathe with new life. For example, one element of the film that I found fascinating was the film's use of colors to represent themes of the various characters. I love how the ""forbidden"" Ellen is always shown in dark, startling colors like bright blues, vibrant yellows, and blood reds whereas the pristine imagine of Mae is shown through light colors like soft, delicate pastels. As for the acting, I found it all to be uniformly superb. From Michelle Pfeiffer, as the fallen from grace Ellen, to the underrated work of Winona Ryder, as uptight May Welland, it all works.As for the twist ending, I wasn't really all that surprised. For a movie that is very beautifully mounted and fully aware of its style over substance, it should come as no surprise that Archer doesn't end up with Ellen. In reality, he wouldn't have either. Image meant a lot in the 1800'sand still does today. Why give up his vision of perfection when it may not honestly be perfection at all? Our imagination of perfection is a lot more powerful than our reality of it.",The Age of Innocence
124,steve-2246,"Great story, great cinematography, why does it need a narrator",5,5 March 2010,"Every great director has to do a period piece. This film is Scorsese's.The filming , the colors, the costumes, the acting, the way the characters can speak volumes with just a glance. All these are done perfectly.But just in case you don't get it there's a voice over to explain every thing to you. And in case you still don't get it, she's going to explain it a couple more times.Why can't Scorsese tell a story visually? This isn't a book, it's a movie! A good movie, but it can't be great if it can't tell the story by itself.",The Age of Innocence
125,Lextical,A challenge for Scorcese's fans and the man himself,8,9 September 2005,"Martin Scorcese's adaptation of Edith Wharton's splendid novel is not only a challenge for Scorcese, but also for his long term fans.Scorcese buffs used to the grit and coarseness of previous films, 'Mean Streets', 'Taxi Driver' and 'Raging Bull' will be surprised by this delicate, but still socially provocative period tale.Meticulously and elegantly visual, Scorcese does well to attempt to recreate 1870s New York which is essential to the reading of Wharton's piece. With beautiful detail, and sumptuous to watch, this is one of the strengths of this film.But there are two main triumphs: Firstly, Daniel Day-Lewis gives an intelligent introspective performance as Newland Archer. His intense relationship with Michelle Pfeiffer sparkles on the screen, and Day-Lewis really gives live to Newland, lifting him off the page as a man caught between two ways of life- rebellion and convention.And secondly, the glowing, knowing narration by Joanne Woodward adds real depth to this social drama. In my opinion the use of narration, saves this film from just being a mere 'costume drama' with emphasis on visual detail than the story itself. Woodward's voice gives reflection and depth to the social context.The acting is well founded and suitably subtle. Michelle Pfeiffer's performance as the 'wayward' Countess Olenska is poignant and fragile yet with the same intensity that Day-Lewis connotes. Her accent is a little too 'American' however, as she looses some of the New England diction that was custom of the time.Winona Ryder sensibly underplays her role as the good hearted May, adding a welcome snooty streak to the character.The supporting cast is well chosen and distinguished, with co-stars such as Geraldine Chaplin, Richard E. Grant, Miriam Margoyles and Sian Phillips. But it is really Margoyles and Phillips who stand out from this line-up, as socially conscious matriarchs.A few of the flaws lie in lingering close-ups and shots, while it is obvious that they are there to establish the attraction between Day Lewis and Pfeiffer's characters, they are slightly overdone.Some of the opera scenes feel a bit 'forced' as well, and do not quite fit into the structure of the film as a whole.But otherwise for Scorcese, this is a triumph proving himself as capable of handling delicate, sensitive romantic dramas with a social conscience. The perfect movie for a night in!",The Age of Innocence
126,Tanechka,~*Absolutely Brilliant*~,10,29 April 2000,"This film is possibly my favorite film of all time.  Words cannot describe how stunningly brilliant ""The Age of Innocence"" is.  Martin Scorcese so effectively visualizes the world of Newland, May, and Ellen that dialogue is scarcely necessary to bring their tragic story forth.  Every shot overflows with significance, making ""The Age of Innocence"" a finely wrought puzzle. Only the truly sensitive viewer will be able to piece it together and gaze upon the full beauty of the film.  Fine performances by Daniel Day-Lewis and Winona Rider, but Michelle Pfeiffer's Countess Olenksa steals the show.",The Age of Innocence
127,Tanechka,~*A Sublime Cinematic Creation*~,10,3 May 1999,"There can perhaps be no other movie as sublimely filmed as ""The Age of Innocence"".  Any lover of period drama will appreciate this film for its exquisite aesthetic beauty.  Scorsese manically recreates Old 1870s New York,which does not serve as merely a background to the actors, but functions as a character itself.  A word on the acting now, which is also heavenly.  Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Winona Ryder are joined by a most competent supporting cast in bringing to life an intensely passionate and tragic romance.  Day-Lewis is so readily the dilletante Archer, Pfeiffer his bohemian lover, and Ryder the naively confidant wife, that one could not image any other persons in said roles.  Well worth the rental!",The Age of Innocence
128,lloydhammett715,Period drama on the life of Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis),8,20 November 2013,"The Age of Innocence""You gave me my first glimpse of a real life. Then you asked me to go on with a false one""- Newland Archer Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a well-respected lawyer who begins to fall for Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) whilst he is engaged to her cousin Mary Welland (Winona Ryder). There is much more depth to the film than just an internal love story as it expresses the lives of the upper class in New York. The exclusivity and distinction of the elite is beautifully shown in this film of passion and loss as the masquerade of the period politics slowly fall apart in the eyes of Newland Archer.The film Age of Innocence takes us into a new realm of skill shown by Martin Scorsese with this brilliant period piece set on the novel by Edith Wharton written in 1920. Scorsese's repertoire has largely held the grit of films such as Taxi Driver, Mean Streets and Goodfellas, but with Age of Innocence there is a more delicate touch to the way the plot unfolds. The novel was introduced to Scorsese by Jay Cocks, who then co wrote the script with him in is his first attempt at converting English literary into a film. What makes this a magnificent piece is Scorsese's understanding of creating an atmosphere that constantly intrigues despite the fact little may seemingly be going on. It is the lighting of the sets that really captures the period of the film, as the candles and fires flicker on the screen. The whole mood of the film stirs within the use of the shadows Scorsese spreads over those whose unorthodox nature could not fit into the mold of the strict high family politics. The beautiful set designs and Academy Award winning costumes brings real sincerity to the exclusion of the high society. The three central performances from Daniel-Day Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder hold the whole social orchestration of the time perfectly. Winona Ryder puts in the performance of her career portraying a delicate and indifferent fabrication to the political tide around her that she rose to with covert ease. A long period of time is covered in the film as we follow their lives and it is the interaction between the central three that stops the film stable as they create the subtle changes with age.The run time is fairly long, standing at two hours twenty minutes, with a long period of the characters lives being covered. There are often jumps of years at a time, which could make for a very messy narrative, however, Joanne Woodward pieces, this together with some elegant narration. It is perfectly condensed into longer sequences and will often include traits of the time during lingering camera work on specifics of the time.It is a film of utter splendour, as we watch the elite play their own little game of beauty, which will no doubt put many off. It is worth seeing to witness a masterful paintbrush by Martin Scorsese who shows a new range of skills that continues to put him in the running as one of the greatest directors of all time.",The Age of Innocence

It is not what you see on screen. There is no blood or violence on screen like other Scorsese movies. But There is pain and blood shell INSIDE.The story is about Love - A forbidden Love. It's the representation of a particular time in the History of America and it's all about human emotionsDon't watch it for some steamy scenes or passionate and romantic dialogues. You will be disappointed. Every character has class and gentleness in behavior and talk. What we see on the screen is the tip of the iceberg. What is happening is really inside their heart.Everyone who once had a forbidden love affair or lost love can immediately connect to this film and feel the pain. It's about what our mind says when we see each scene. After the film, The minds will be still working. Outstanding performances by the lead actors.

131,freestyleonthemove,A pleasure for the eyes,8,3 January 2003,"I really liked this movie because it was so rich in every aspect: from the acting, to the setting and the costumes, the cinematography and the score, everything was beautifully crafted. The movie seems to start slowly and the story is only relatively important. More than anything it is an occasion for Scorsese to talk about the NY upper society of the late 1800, and it's rigid way, sometimes desperate (see Ryder's character), often cruel to maintain an identity (paradoxically built on the European upper class mold) despite the changes that were happening. I was very impressed by the use of the objects, the clothes of the time to describe the feeling of the scene or of the characters involved.The actors are all very good, but Michelle Pfeiffer really delivers and excellent performance. Also Winona Ryder's character is well portrayed and towards the end of the movie, the actress is able to convincingly show how her character is much more layered than what it seems to be in the beginning of the story.In my opinion this movie deserves 8",The Age of Innocence

Michelle Pfieffer seems to be the only actress who didn't fully embrace the period in manner or behaviour, but the rest of the performers aquit themselves wonderfully.At times it almost felt a little 'modern', but one can't fault the film makers, they were only trying to update it a bit for their intended audience.Altogether a wonderful film and definitely worth seeing, but - as always- the book remains far superior.",The Age of Innocence
133,sheenawhite,Quick overview,7,24 March 2003,"***SPOILERS***    ***SPOILERS*** This film struck me as a story of undying love, surrounded by lies and betrayal.  The story revolves around three main characters.  There is a naïve young woman named May who is part of an upper class family in New York.  As well as her fiancé, Newland, who is a business man and also a part of an upper class family.  And May's cousin, Ellen, a duchess who is temporarily in New York to escape her negligent husband.  From the very moment that Newland sets eye on the duchess, you just know that he will fall in love with her, for she is far more sophisticated and mature than May. Newland soon finds himself having a passionate affair with his fiancé's cousin.  He is torn between the innocent young girl he gave his heart to long ago and the worldly enchantress who represents everything he has ever longed for. I didn't enjoy this film very much until the very end.  The unsuspected little twist was what made me look back at all the aspects of the film with understanding.  It made me sympathize and even begin to like a character (May), whom I thought was too naïve, meek, and dimwitted throughout the entire film.  She was actually a lot smarter than I thought and it was a shame that she had to die before her husband could realize it as well.",The Age of Innocence
134,jpvbm,Some things are worth fighting for,9,2 March 2013,"The Age of Innocence is centered within the ""crème de la crème"" of New York's society during the second half of the nineteenth century. There is absolutely no scarcity of means for its dwellers. They lunch, dine and amuse themselves almost like royalty. The meals are divided in many courses, they are always wearing tuxedos and ball dresses, the gentlemen change their pair of gloves for each lady they waltz with. But there seems to be a price for such an exquisite way of living.The uneasiness of the story begins when Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis), already groomed to the fresh young, loving May Welland (Winona Ryder), begins to tilt his attraction for Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) who has just arrived from Europe, after splitting with her husband. The matter is that Mrs Olenska, although having lived in New York before marring, never really got used to its usages. Also, her possible divorce seems to hang over the entire society as a true scandal. For his part, Newland accepts her misfortune and understands it as a challenge to the solid old conventions they all endure. Thus, the natural, slight, almost unperceivable, retraction everybody seems have towards the Countess is nonexistent within Newland. This boundless relation between them allows him to envisage her as an escape from a living he soon describes as the taste of ""cinders in his mouth"".The Age of Innocence is about incarceration without bars, at least for the protagonist. He lives on a society where people have ""no character, no colour, no variety"", where they cannot truly speak their minds. When Newland realizes he is in love for the Countess, and starts to act like it, all this society moves discreetly and almost imperceptibly to prevent him from reaching his goal. In spite of this general effort, Archer is not prevented solely by his peers, but ultimately due his and the Countess's countenance. Chance also plays a part on this decorum prevention, as it happens on the beautiful lighthouse scene.This movie is also, and mostly, about choices, and the right ones. Much later, when the whole stillborn romance is over for all, we are somehow struck with the summing up of Archer's life, and the positive outcome that he kept the respect for his wife, family and even for himself, by refusing to be subdued to what could have been the great love of his life, and, simultaneously, the rejection of his entire self as how he lived it. In the end we are granted with the notion that life doesn't resume only to passionate love above all else. The inevitable association is with that scene on ""Closer"" when Natalie Portman's character, on knowing Jude Law's betrayal, says to him: ""There's a moment, there's always a moment, ""I can do this, I can give into this, or I can resist it"""". Closer's protagonist gave in, Newland Archer did not.Another obligatory comparison is with ""The Bridges of Madison County"". On this movie Maryl Streep's character, married for many years, is bound in a few days long romance. Much later, when she dies and her already grown up daughter searches through her mother's closed-for-decades trunk, the most precious things to be found are the letters exchanged by the deceased and her mistress. ""The Bridges of Madison County"" presents upside-down, implausible, ethics, as the woman keep on being married, sharing a whole life together with her husband, but, alas, the altar of her existence rests on a weekend affair. Therefore, on ""The Age of Innocence"" the protagonist follows an entirely different path, much more credible by all means, as his lustful aspirations are sublimated throughout his marriage, full of its typical nuances, hardships and achievements that keeps binding the two of them together.This is what coming of age really is about!",The Age of Innocence
135,academicpc,Disappointed!,5,14 October 2007,"I guess it had to happen. Enough people have been telling Martin Scorsese that he's a genius enough times that he figured he had to take on a bit of ""classic"" literature.Edith Wharton is great. Martin Scorsese is really great. The cast and crew of this movie are fantastic. But the flick is a lead turd.I don't know what it is about a certain point in a great director's career when they feel like they have to deny everything they've ever found true in themselves and prove something. And this movie feels like Marty's trying to prove something.The only good thing that came of this is that it appears Scorsese has worked whatever induced him to make this movie out of his system. Plus, he met Daniel Day Lewis who lit up the screen in The Gangs of New York.If I didn't know that Scorsese was the director of this film, I might have liked it better.

This film is not for everyone as it requires patience, but the payoff at the end was worth it as the final frames reference other key moments from earlier scenes. I typically hate period dramas with slow pace and excessive dialogue, but Scorcese seems aware of this: scenes are brief with short conversations, mixed with narration, backed with an amazing score throughout (esp. Enya's hypnotic 'Marble Halls), unique camera angles for emphasis and wonderfully subdued performances. It's not a film designed to showcase an actors performance as it is the direction and look of the picture that stand out.I read a review which criticized the use of excessive camera tricks, weak performances and dull subject matter. Nonsense. Scorcese is not Tarantino. Every fade, cut and camera angle has a desired effect. I felt each actor melted into their character and the immense frustration of Newland Archer build as the film went on.I did not read the book (nor would want to), and for others who have not, this story is about the struggle of two lovers experiencing the tragedy of failed opportunities and unspoken expectations within a period and culture of strict norms. Regardless of time and place, however, it's a struggle which is every bit as relevant today as it was in 19th century NewYork. A different choice of words, an approach instead of a retreat, a difference of 5 or 6 seconds- all seemingly small things which change the course of our lives.Is this a masterpiece? Scorcese's best?

I was absolutely floored! I think that, cinematically, it is the best picture Scorsese's done since Raging Bull. Beautiful & brilliant. I even thought that some scenes, particularly the dinners, were slightly reminiscent of Kubrick.I thought Michelle Pfeiffer was absolutely superb. I don't follow her work much, but of what I do know, I find this to be her best - and most serious - performance to date. I was somewhat disappointed in Daniel Day-Lewis who I otherwise love to watch. I felt his performance was uneven. When he was ""on"", he was on, but at times his performance was stilted and even melodramatic which jarred his credibility. Wynona did a terrific job of portraying covert deviousness with a blank and/or airhead facade.But what shone above all the acting was Scorsese's paintbrush.

Great romances were never meant to be easy, or obvious.  That's where Scorsese skill begins, you never know the fate of the lovers even though you can easily guess with the movie nature. The characters in this movie are interesting  not for what they say, but for what they imply.  This movie to be honest is totally vicious in its nature, as the world around Newland Archer tries to steer him against his heart, without being obvious.The performances are wonderful, I specially have to mention the wonderful narration work by Joanne Woodward.  As Roger Ebert says in his review it is more interesting to watch 30 minutes of foreplay, than 30 minutes of kissing.  As a suggestion for anyone who sees this movie analize Archer final decision, and Mae's role throught out his life, you'll get a great satisfaction if you did.",The Age of Innocence

The film was so devoid of substance (character development, memorable dialog) that I couldn't remember the plot of the film two hours after I saw it.

I remember finding Day-Lewis' acting and character far too languid and exasperatingly soft-spoken for instance. Having examined the film closely this time, I have found that both Day-Lewis and Pfeiffer are in fact breathtaking. Day- Lewis' character is meek only on the outside; on his face, he lets you glimpse into the storm and the rebellion that are raging inside. Pfeiffer's Countess Olenska is vivid and charming, at times woeful. In those incredible eyes of hers - made of glass, tinged with blood sometimes - and under her smile, there is struggle, vulnerability and abnegation. When you watch this film, you cannot be knitting or snacking, you should not leave the actors out of your sight for a second or you will miss the ""action"". The film is like a bow that is being subtly stretched and stretched to its utter limit and never released.The story is wonderful from a writer's point of view, awful from a human perspective.Edith Wharton is the negative image of Jane Austen. She studies 19th century American high society with the same scrutiny and mercilessness as Austen observes the ridicules of the Regency landed gentry. But Austen is infinitely pleasing and funny, Wharton's characters are tormented, desperate, trapped, their lives wasted. Your heart breaks.I come to the point I really wanted to make. Scorsese's film is flawed. The incredible acting, Wharton's story, the costumes, the music and the director's unquestionable skills result in a film that is utterly compelling, but a disaster... of sorts.First of all, there is the awful narration. Yes, the words are beautifully written. Of course they are, they belong to Edith Wharton. But they are a nuisance in the context of the film, like a mosquito buzzing in your ear, or unwanted background music. Why does a director of this caliber resort to such a clumsy method to inform the audience?Secondly, Scorsese's virtuosity gets in the way of the story. He is too present as a director. What works wonderfully well in his other films often appears superfluous or downright monstrous here. Not a single frame is shot without the director's ostentatious signature on it. Everything is filmed flamboyantly, stylishly.The lavish camera work is trying to match point by point the sumptuous nature of the story, the magnificent costumes, the opera house, the forbidden and exacerbated feelings, the muted scandals. It becomes a character of its own, a distracting, overwhelming creature. In this story of restraint, the camera is too loud.The BBC makes better period adaptations, they seem to have worked out that the best make-up is the one you cannot see. With works by Austen and Wharton, you do not have to muster all your directorial sorcery, the stories are so exquisitely written that, once you have got your team of writers, actors, hairdressers etc, you just have to let the plots unfold. They take care of themselves.What a strange period drama Scorsese has given us. A riveting failure. A beautiful disaster. Like the lives of Newland Archer and Ellen Olenska.",The Age of Innocence
143,melissacasting-org,A Splendid Look Back At Luchino Visconti,10,1 October 2012,"Exquisite and yet dark, pungent, unforgiving. The best, the most cinematic kind of period drama since Visconti's ""Senso'. Martin Scorsese is, without question, the master of his generation. After his dark paintings of New York, the New York of ""Taxi Driver"" or ""The King Of Comedy"" this look back at a time when not just New York, but America was defining its identity. Daniel Day Lewis is sublime and Michelle Pfeiffer gives the performance of her life. I was also profoundly moved for that glimpse of Alexis Smith in her last film appearance and the wonderful voice of Joanne Woodward narrating Edith Wharton's words. Thank you!",The Age of Innocence
144,bkus,Perfection on Celluloid,10,17 November 2005,"While Edith Wharton may not be to everyone's taste it is hard to argue with the attention to detail and love Scorcese put into the entire film. From the meticulous casting of even the minute roles to the details in upper class living give a flavor to this film that is difficult to find in most other period pieces. Day-Lewis and Pfieffer have very different acting styles and it shows to the advantage of all - the film, the two of them and the movement of the picture. There is not one character who does not have a significant connection with one or the other or both of these characters. While Winona Ryder's performance hits the marks it is the performance of the actress playing Granny Mingott that stays. I see this film at least once a year and never tire of it. No wrong notes in this one!",The Age of Innocence
145,Woody-82,Underrated masterpiece from the top director of our times.,9,7 February 2000,"For those who wonder what is Mr. Scorsese looking for in a film like ""The Age of Innocence"", (probably more suitable to a director such as James Ivory), the man himself gives the answer: ""This film deals with the same matters that can be found in my work in the last 25 years. There is guilt, desire, obsessed passion and the weakness to satisfy that passion"".The story takes place in New York, around 1880. Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) must choose between his current fiancee May Welland (Winona Ryder) and her cousin who has just arrived from Poland and is recently divorced, Helen Ollenska (Michelle Pfeiffer). May is the symbol of a world he's familiar with, and Helen represents the world he's dreaming of.Living in a conservative world full of compromises, Newland is as much trapped by his social circle as the Italian-American heroes of Mean Streets and GoodFellas. However, the Mafia here is called New York aristocracy and kills with words, with a gesture or with a look of contempt and rejection, instead of using guns. Scorsese fans who expect to see psychotic characters, violence or De Niro-style performances, will be disappointed. Everything in this movie is based on the observation and recording of the social behaviour codes, the unexpressed feelings and of things  which are not not said but implied. Scorsese portrayed with absolute preciseness, almost paragraph to paragraph, Edith Wharton's classic novel. However, he managed to give the film his own unique personal view, proving his gigantic talent and that he's capable of creating masterpieces, whatever the heroes, the story or the genre of the film. Winona Ryder should definitely have won the Oscar for her wonderful performance, but Lewis and Pfeiffer are marvellous as well. What's left to say? The Age of Innocence is an un-excusably underrated all time classic.",The Age of Innocence
146,mandyhd,A must see of Scorcese,9,5 August 2001,"See this one on a big screen if you can, it is exquisite visually. The storyline is age-old but not cliched and reveals much insight into the ""aristocracy"" of period New York. Scorcese's gentle treatment of human fraility, true love and desire and the brutality of duty and honour is subtle and deeply moving.Daniel Day-Lewis gives a sacrificial and award winning performance. Winona Ryder is perfect. Michelle Pfeiffer, always good has been miscast here in my humble opinion - one of two minor mistakes.  The second mistake is arguably the ending.The opening credit sequence is (was) original and captivating. This is one of the few films that not only honours its literacy source but improves upon it.",The Age of Innocence
147,lisaxxdavidson-27158,I couldn't stand it.,1,17 February 2021,"Overblown and unnecessary. I couldn't stand anybody except for Winona Ryder. I hate the Ellen character (why does she wallow in self-pity? What is she doing with her life, besides wasting it?) And Newland Archer, well, I don't know. That foot-kissing scene was a bit beyond me. And the fat lady, one can only ask why. I'm sorry. What a waste of time. Was she actually too fat to sit in the front row at her granddaughter's wedding? She wanted to rebuild the pew for her own occupation, but it must be a very narrow church that she can't even fit in the front row? I couldn't stand it from the beginning, but something kept me with it until I just couldn't stand it any more. Waiting for the sailboat to pass the lighthouse, indeed. Good grief. To praise the Ellen character by saying that she spent her time among writers and artists. Well . . . . whatever.",The Age of Innocence

149,MisterHollywood,A masterpiece!,10,22 December 2004,"The Age of Innocence is simply the best work by director Martin Scorcese and is deservedly entitled to the numerous accolades it has received. Mr. Scorcese's style and panache is elaborate in his film adaptation of Edith Wharton's moving novel of a forbidden love and the desideration between the two. Pfeiffer gives the most heart-wrenching performance as the object of desire. Daniel Day Lewis, equally talented, is the tortured lover who must choose, a promise of marriage to Mae (Winona Ryder) or risk his stalwart reputation in society to express his love for Pfeiffer. The cinematography is beautiful and the cast phenomenal. I highly recommend this film to everyone.",The Age of Innocence
150,elle55407,Most beautiful and heartbreaking movie I have ever seen...,10,26 February 2005,"I saw this when it first came out in the theater and loved it. And when I bought it on DVD last year, I never really got around to watching it again until recently. Now, I can't seem to pull it out of my DVD player! It has been playing and playing and playing. I think I've seen it 9 times in the past three days.The film was beautifully shot. The story is absolutely gut wrenching. Each scene made me more anxious for the next. And it made my heart physically ache for the Daniel Day Lewis character. What a predicament. As usual, Day Lewis was superb! Watch his reactions closely. What other actor do you know who can say so much without ever speaking a word? Wish we'd see even more of him, these days.I LOVE when Scorsese moves from his normal genre. I think he makes more poignant films when he does. That said, I would encourage anyone and everyone to see this film and watch it more than once. For the story the first time around. For the beautiful backdrop the second. And for the subtle camera moves and details the next. I remembered this movie fondly from 1993. And I praise it now for all that I missed then and finally caught on to the second, third, fourth...time around.A beautifully sad movie.",The Age of Innocence
151,orcdictator,"If You Haven't Watched This Film Already, Do So.",9,8 April 2018,"Wow. Before we begin, I want to take a moment to appreciate just how baffled I am by the amount of people writing reviews while using any 4-syllable word just to sound ''refined'', high class and/or intellectuals. Well, I guess that by today's standards, anyone who uses more than three syllables in a single word is considered to be a professor. I'm really laughing my ass off as I write this. Wow.*AHEM* LET'S GET STARTED, LADIES AND GENTS!First of all, I've got to make it clear that this movie is devoid of any type of gunfight, blood or whatever. Do NOT expect action out of this film. What Mr. Scorsese shows us here is... you guessed it, a love story. Man, do I hate love stories. But not this one. This movie is, to me at least, art. I don't think I can explain enough without spoiling things here and there, so let's just talk about the basic stuff. 
*1.ACTING-* Superb. Daniel Day Lewis really delivers, as expected. Oh and did I mention that I love Michelle Pfeiffer's acting as well? No? Well I do.
*2. CINEMATOGRAPHY-* Excellent! The way the camera just ''strolls'' slowly through each scene, emphasizing on the characters and the story, just great. Mr. Scorsese, have another cookie.
*3. PLOT-* Although it isn't my kind of story, which is a romance story, I think it is a well-made piece of work. It progresses at a pace that it doesn't drag on for too long, nor does it go ''A-OOH OOH GO FAST'' like most speedo apes writing scripts nowadays, which dare I say, end their movies abruptly and leave you cringing in your seat. One more thing I liked is that the mob family in this movie doesn't use violence, as a fellow reviewer (a professor!) mentioned somewhere in this review thread. That's something we don't see in movies often! They instead use little more than smiles, politeness and stuff like that. And that is just impressive.*Overall, I liked it, I recommend it, my actual review is 8.7 stars but whatever, here's a 9.*",The Age of Innocence
152,"""Ace"" Rothstein",Scorsese- for Scorsese fans,10,8 July 2000,"It is mildly ironic that, considering the material and its background that, in making The Age of Innocence, Martin Scorsese produced perhaps one the films most true to his most unique canon and at the same time, so true to Wharton's novel. In the master's hands this powerful tale of repression, indecision, and passion lives up to its full capacity, and perhaps is taken further by a tone conveying the entire range of potential emotion contained within a wonderful story. Spectacular performances from Daniel Day Lewis, Winona Ryder, and Pfeiffer. A beautifully shot film, wonderful music, and a great cast, all one has come to expect from Scorsese. A welcome change of pace in tone, a refreshingly powerful example of storytelling, The Age of Innocence is some of Scorsese at his best.",The Age of Innocence
153,acer424005,"Superb score, direction, and cinematography--and all-round acting!",10,2 June 2000,"One can only marvel at Scorsese's direction on this one; coupled with the stunning and clever cinematography, this film paints a lovingly detailed tapestry of  the lives of well-to-do New Yorkers, in the last quarter of the 19th century. Unusual little tricks of focusing, and light or color changes at dramatic points in the story serve to add  extra emotional and romantic tension to the action.As with many great films, a fine score often serves to elevate the story to an even higher level of quality. Elmer Bernstein's remarkable work here is superb, and beyond mere words. I shall never tire of hearing this beautiful score!As for the acting, the entire cast is simply perfect. In particular, in my opinion the performances of Daniel Day-Lewis and Winona Ryder are the finest they have ever given. They truly become their characters, and in so doing, pull us full into this unique, and soon to fade away, dream-like era!",The Age of Innocence
154,mildsedative,"Beautiful, But Not For Everyone",10,7 June 2000,"This is quite possibly one of the most visually stunning period pieces ever filmed.  From the gorgeous opening credits to the final, perfectly-composed shot, it is an aesthetic feast for any fan of the genre.""The Age Of Innocence"" is one of my personal favorites.  The film stays remarkably true to the Wharton novel, fleshing out details and bringing the permeating emotion and atmosphere to life with exquisite cinematography, directing, and acting.  Michelle Pfeiffer is superb as the free-spirited but (unknowingly) scandalous Ellen Olenska, and Daniel Day-Lewis provides a fine complement as Newland Archer (though I'd hesitate to call it his best work--he comes across as rather spiritless at times--that, and Pfeiffer steals the screen every shot she's in).  Winona Ryder is somewhat forgettable next to Pfeiffer, but this could be considered in keeping with their characters.However.  ""The Age Of Innocence"", in the tradition of character-driven period pieces, does move at a slower pace and relies on subtext and subtleties (which the acting and direction exemplify well), which many people find boring.  And at nearly two and a half hours, there isn't much action to sustain someone looking for an ""escape"" movie--unless, of course, you're escaping to the lush but restrained world of Old New York.  Also, since this film is such a departure from other Scorsese pictures, fans of his violent urban dramas might be a little surprised.However, if you've got some time you can dedicate to watching this aesthetically gratifying portrait of desire and sacrifice (and manipulation, how can we forget that?), I highly recommend you pick it up.",The Age of Innocence
155,mordredqv,true love presented beautifully,10,14 June 2006,"I saw this movie a 2nd time this evening. And of all the costume movies, this remains my favorite.It takes you away not just in an illusion (wich any ordinary film can accomplish), but in an emotional involvement that makes you remember what true love really can mean. One can actually feel their own heart pounding, as if he/she was one of the characters. Many things are ""said"" that way w/o any words being said at all. It's because of these small, but very striking things that makes this film not just a film, but a view on what normally every person will encounter in his life.Seeing that film is an emtional adventure that will (hopefully) leave something behind...",The Age of Innocence
156,misterpirate,Horrendous & unbearable,4,25 September 2006,"Adapted to the screen from the awful book ""The Age Of Innocence"" by Edith Wharton (with 10 pages worth reading - the rest being filled with obscure details about furniture and dull, repetitive descriptions of Old New York etiquette). Making that into a film...A TERRIBLE MISTAKE!!While watching this movie I became more and more frustrated, dear lord - the cheesy fades and effects were painful to watch and were not at all fitting with the 'movie'. The lead acting was amazingly bad, some of the side characters were well done, but this movie focused on the wonderful faces of Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder. They may be beautiful, but under the direction of Martin Scorsese their acting was contrived and sore. Was it possible to make a bad book into a good movie...well no, so like the book nothing happened in the movie. There was a slight conflict, nothing more. I cannot stress this enough - nothing happened, boring.I must say that the collection of antiques and lighting in the film were very well done, but besides that - horrible. Not worth any viewer's time. 4/10",The Age of Innocence
157,dawnmcollver,Masterfully done!,10,7 December 2020,"Very seldom do I read a book and then find the movie version equally satisfying, but this is one of those rare occasions! I first read the book after being led to Edith Wharton's work in a college literature course. After reading Ethan Frome, I was hooked and looked for another Wharton classic. I chose The Age of Innocence, which became one of my all-time favorite novels. When the movie was released, I viewed it with a healthy dose of skepticism, as most movies fall far short of living up to their literary counterparts, in my opinion. This one did not! I loved this movie from the opening credits to the closing. Casting was wonderful. I loved Joanne Woodward's narration. The costumes and settings were beautiful. Best of all was the faithfulness to the ending...rather than satisfy our need for a ""happily ever after"", the movie stays true to what is a bit of a disappointing ending for our protagonists--much as happens in real life. I actually enjoy movies like this for that reason. Not everything needs to be polished and perfectly packaged at the end just to fulfill our romantic ideals. So well-done and still one of my all-time favorite movies!",The Age of Innocence

Same movie,but different appreciation when you grew up. I, then realized that May is the winner of this triangle relationships. Until the end of the movie I realized that she was not a fool at all. All of her words were all being calculated. She knew it all along! She maybe selfish from one point of view,but this is life and the cruelty of human that everyone has. She kept silent about her husband's betrayal and carried it together to her coffin. Just a last confession to her eldest son that once she did make her husband stayed with her rather than went away with his lover.She is the true winner and Archer accepted it in the end of the film.",The Age of Innocence
159,snow-cat-1996,Age of Innocence,9,26 April 2011,"Age of Innocence was an absolutely excellent movie, although it may be a bit slow for those seeking the typical action packed car chasing, sexually explicit movies, whose style can also become mundane. I thought the subtleties of the characters'actions in this movie spoke loudly, unlike any movie I have ever seen,and stressed the torment and attitude of the characters poignantly. I found it extraordinarily amazing how Scorsese's had his characters say so much, yet at times, not even open their mouths. Very, very moving. My ONLY complaint has to do with the angle that the description of the movie on the DVD gives...Instead of implying that the 18th century attitudes were so proper and Newland's reactions to his situation were so ""correct"", I felt differently about what the movie message was, particularly regarding ""Newland"". Unlike what the description says, Newland did NOT risk ""everything he had"" to be with Ellen--he risked NOTHING!!! That's why he lost. Newland was more concerned about his ""image"" and reputation,(not unlike most people today), than being true to his heart and everyone else. He wanted to have his cake and eat it too, on his own terms, but keep his ""image"" intact. Ellen said, I love you, but I don't want you ""this way""...and her integrity far outshined Newland's, but he didn't seem too concerned about it in himself. Newland in my eyes, was not a man of honor like he so tried to project himself to be, but rather a weakling. By not being openly forthright and honest on all accounts, he ""created"" what he feared. So Newland got exactly what he asked for. Nothing he wanted, but all he deserved.",The Age of Innocence
160,guymacher,Boring boring boring,2,27 June 2012,"Scorsese has made a audio novel with pictures. So very little action happens, the movie could as readily been a series of still shots. Almost anything of import is narrated of over shots of ornate dinnerware or cut flowers in vases worth more than most Cadillacs.None of the actors need much emotional range. Most of their time is spent sitting looking at each other about the say things in a monotone. No one shouts or giggles. A baby cries during one of the narrations at his christening and by the time the narration is over, he has already graduated from college with a degree in architecture.The music is lovely. The settings and actors resplendent. But one might as well read Wharton's novel while playing the sound track as to waste time watching this movie.",The Age of Innocence

Joanne Woodward's narration is weak and her voice lacks polish. A different actress, one from New York particularly, might have carried the narration stronger. Beatrice Straight comes to mind. Had she been alive, Colleen Dewhurst (not from NY) would have added class and her voice and its beautiful eloquence would have matched the visual. I think this was a major problem. Woodward reads the narration as if she was Beatrice Potter. Daniel Day- Lewis is exceptional as always but the two female leads are playing dress up at the High school play. Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder are talented actors but are both miscast or were overwhelmed by the script, which is intelligent but overwrought. Scorcese should have speeded up the actors. A better director for this type of film should have been Sidney Lumet. I still give it a 7, nonetheless.",The Age of Innocence

I realize that most modern viewers may not have seen them (they are rarely re-run on TV although they may be available for rental,etc.) I didn't find Mr.Scorsese's film too interesting or exciting overall when compared to those productions. The portrayal of the main characters was not compelling enough. The acting was adequate but restrained and monotonous. There were too many dead and dull moments in the film. I liked the music which was good and not placed so as to interfere with he dialog as in so many modern films. I couldn't figure out what the narration added to this work.

There is a great deal of feeling and subjectivity portrayed by the actors and the characters they play convey so much emotion. Truly touching.There film uses a lot of colour, sometimes in a brave way which is unusual for a 1993 production. Straight away you can see how much passion and effort was put into the making of the movie with the long shots, choreography and complex scenes.Made me cry, just like the book!",The Age of Innocence
