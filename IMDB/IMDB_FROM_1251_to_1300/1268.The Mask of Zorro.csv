0,TheLittleSongbird,Splendid swashbuckling entertainment!,8,8 June 2009,"I will not deny that I am not particularly into swashbucklers that much, but I will be prepared to say that the Mask of Zorro is splendid entertainment. Antonio Banderas gives a very spirited performance as Alejandro, and the well-choreographed sword fights, beautiful score and witty screenplay allow Banderas to do what he does best. Anthony Hopkins is perfect as Don Diego, giving his character a sense of bitterness, sensitivity and vulnerability that make all his performances so endearing. In fact, this, Silence of the Lambs and The Elephant Man just go to show what a great actor Hopkins is; the only film he disappoints in is in Chaplin, where he played the rather unnecessary role of the fictional autobiographer. Catherine Zeta Jones is lovely beyond words as Elena, and Stuart Wilson plays his his-sable villain almost to perfection, but Matt Letscher as Captain Love isn't quite as threatening as he should be. The cinematography is very handsome, capturing perfectly the beautiful sets and costumes. The only other criticism I have of the movie, is its length, it's quite excessive. But I will say the explosive finale and spirited performances more than compensate, making it a very well-done and entertaining film. I wasn't as impressed with the sequel, the swordplay was more like slapstick and the plot was less involving and a little bloated. 8/10 for Mask of Zorro though. Bethany Cox",The Mask of Zorro
1,Leofwine_draca,Not right,4,19 September 2021,"I like the old swashbuckling costume adventures well enough but not this attempted updating. Too long, too derivative and too cheesy with the romantic scenes between Zeta Jones and Banderas. The latter loses a lot of the goodwill he built up in DESPERADO. Worst of all is camp guylinered Anthony Hopkins who appears to think he's in a pantomime.",The Mask of Zorro
2,SnoopyStyle,Fun light entertaining,7,4 October 2013,"Don Diego de la Vega (Anthony Hopkins) is the original Zorro who battled the tyrannical Spanish rule of Governor Montero. On the verge of liberation, Zorro is imprisoned, his wife killed, and his daughter abducted. Twenty years later, Montero returns to take advantage and Zorro escapes with Alejandro Murrieta (Antonio Banderas). Zorro decides to train Alejandro as the new Zorro.This is a good adventure flick. It has fun sword play especially with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Antonio Banderas. They have good chemistry together. And so does Hopkins and Banderas. It keeps the tone light and irreverent. It's an entertaining romp.",The Mask of Zorro
3,classicsoncall,"""Zorro, you look better than ever!""",7,23 November 2020,"I watched this film's sequel a little over a year ago, so I went back to that film to check some stats and I was surprised to see that the name of Antonio Banderas' character is different in both pictures. Here he's known as Alejandro Murrieta, while in 2005's ""The Legend of Zorro, his name is Don Alejandro de la Vega, a combination if you will of his first name in this picture and that of Anthony Hopkins' Don Diego de la Vega. Released some seven years apart I guess no one would really catch the difference, but it makes me wonder why the script writers would allow a lapse in continuity like that. However both pictures are fun and entertaining, with the requisite amount of sword play, fire and explosions to make for a couple hours of worthwhile viewing. The story line here held the prospect of succeeding generations of the Zorro character, with an older version represented by Hopkins, and Banderas the newer one to take up the mantle of the masked vigilante. And I use the term 'vigilante' in the same manner as I've seen it utilized in a handful of old time 'B' Westerns in which the term suggested a mysterious character who stood up for the downtrodden and took it to the bad guys, contrary to the way it's meaning evolved over the years. Banderas and Zeta-Jones make a dashing couple, and I'm probably not too far off saying that as Elena, Zeta-Jones never looked better. Come to think of it, Hopkins looked rather dashing himself as the mentor of his masked successor. What the story could have used would have been a better suited pair of villains. Stuart Wilson as Don Rafael Montero and Matt Letscher as Captain Love didn't seem to have the look or temperament to be dangerous adversaries for the pair of Zorro's. But what was cool was seeing old time character actor L.Q. Jones in the role of Three-Fingered Jack. Jones would show up multiple times in TV Westerns of the Fifties and Sixties, often as different characters. As I write, this, he's still alive at ninety three!",The Mask of Zorro
4,lee_eisenberg,"Corny, but worth seeing.",7,6 April 2006,"Whereas usually there was only one Zorro, this time they have the famous Zorro (Anthony Hopkins) teaching a new one (Antonio Banderas) how to fight oppression in 1841 California. Granted, ""The Mask of Zorro"" is pretty corny; it mostly consists of people sword-fighting, jumping on and off tables, and such things (there's always conveniently something for him to use), but it is a good look at the history of the Golden State. Of course, I had never heard of Catherine Zeta-Jones before this, but she was quite impressive here, and has done some impressive stuff since. All in all, a pretty fun movie.Oh, and ""zorro"" means ""fox"" in Spanish. I would assume that women are supposed to consider him a fox.",The Mask of Zorro
5,jboothmillard,The Mask of Zorro,7,23 September 2007,"If you have never seen any of the classic films about the black Spanish caped crusader with the flat-brimmed Andalusian-style hat, black cowl mask, bull-whip and rapier (sword), and that always makes the 'Z' mark with three cuts, then this modern take on the adventure stories is a fantastic one, from director Martin Campbell (GoldenEye, Casino Royale). Basically, it is the early 19th century in California where Zorro, secret true identity Diego De Le Vega (first played by Sir Anthony Hopkins) was a champion against the tyranny of Spanish rule, represented by ruthless Governor Raphael Monterro (Stuart Wilson). Unfortunately, after a great triumph, Diego goes home to his wife and child, and Monterro has discovered his identity, and he attacks his wife and the house, abducts his baby girl, and imprisons him. Twenty years later, Monterro returns to California intent on bringing foul play to his total control, while Diego has escaped his long imprisonment and prepares revenge. Part of this involves training orphan who (coincidently) helped him as a boy, Alejandro Murrieta (Golden Globe nominated Antonio Banderas) who has also suffered a loss, his brother killed himself when they couldn't escape a situation, he also wants revenge. As training progresses, Alejandro gets closer to earning the costume and horse to do justice, and he also constantly encounters the daughter Monterro stole from Diego, the beautiful Elena De Le Vega (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who he obviously falls for. Also starring Matt Letscher as Capt. Harrison Love With some good witty dialogue, and great action sequences, this is quite a lot of fun. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Sound, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Costume Design, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Sir Anthony Hopkins was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 1 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, he was number 1 on Britain's Finest Actors, and he was number 3 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!",The Mask of Zorro
6,ccthemovieman-1,"Fun, Old-Fashioned Adventure",9,22 April 2006,"This movie had just a couple of things I would have changed but the overwhelming minutes of this 137-minute movie were well done: a nice old- fashioned adventure story.Yes, it's hokey in spots, there is a needless irreverent scene in the confessional and the final action scene goes on too long, but all of that is almost standard fare in today's films. Anyway, the ""good"" in this film far outweighs the ""bad.""Some of the ""good"" is beautiful cinematography featuring bold colors; good action scenes; very little profanity; interesting and somewhat likable lead characters (played by Anthony Hopkins, Antonio Bandaras and Catherine Zeta- Jones), a fun story and very good 5.1surround sound.Zeta-Jones was a brand new ""face"" with this movie and she's never looked better. Hopkins, as usual, is the best character as the older ""Zorro"" who teaches the young one (Bandaras). Some of the action scenes are almost cartoon-like in credibility (Bandaras doing flips while riding two horses at once!) but they are fun.The story is a familiar one that seems to always satisfy people: revenge.",The Mask of Zorro
7,ma-cortes,"Exquisite adventure with horse action, fencing duels and swashbuckling",7,13 February 2010,"Antonio Banderas is appropriately magnificent along with gorgeous heroine Catherine Zeta-Jones.This superior Zorro with great swordplay is a lavish swashbuckler starred by Anthony Hopkins and Antonio Banderas as the dashing masked avengers . A young Banderas dons a black outfit and becomes the ideal Zorro riding in the hoofprints continuing in the wake of the old Zorro-Hopkins who passes his mantle of protector of hapless ad unfortunates. This is a zesty recounting of saga of legendary masked rider , though not as distinctive as previous classic entry starred by Tyrone Power. Here Zorro faces danger from governor Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson) as well as corrupt villain captain Harrison (Matt Letscher). And Anthony Hopkins gives slickness and distinction as elegant veteran Zorro. After numerous setbacks the hero and his lovely heroine, a wonderful Catherine Zeta-Jones, help the good people of California thwart the greedy schemes of a meanie who stands in the way of statehood for the territory. The nimble actor Banderas runs and jumps all over the images of this movie, as he deals with the oppressor with a breathtaking finale and wreak havoc included.In this first Zorro starred by Antonio Banderas took a chance and jumped from comedy-action to costumed comedy-adventures; he steals the show as Murrieta/Zorro relishing his secret identity with cape and sword; executing bounds and leaps, twists and climbs and throughly enjoys himself. A great casting and an unstopped action keep this picture moving at a rapid clip. Banderas made the character of Zorro his own and quickly established himself as a Latin legend. Antonio Banderas is terrific as the Zorro, well accompanied by ideal heroine, a beautiful Zeta-Jones. Nice secondary cast, such as Stuart Wilson, overacting outrageously as the villain, and actors as Tony Amendola and Pedro Armendariz Jr , booth of whom will repeat acting in the following. Furthermore, overwhelming swordplay and horse action and displays too much of everything. Stirring musical score by James Horner and colorful cinematography by Phil Meheux. Other versions about this known character created by Johnston McCulley are the following : The mute classic adaptation ¨Mark of Zorro¨(1920, Fred Niblo, with Douglas Fairbanks), the classic ¨Mark of Zorro¨(1940, Robert Mamoulian with Tyrone Power, Basil Rathbone and Linda Darnell), and followed by ¨The legend of Zorro¨( 2005, Martin Campbell again with Banderas and Catherine Zeta Jones, Tony Amendola,Pedro Armendariz and Rufus Sewell) and European version ¨Zorro¨(1975, Duccio Tessari with Alain Delon, Octavia Piccolo and Stanley Baker) . Rating : 7,5, good, better than average. The motion picture will appeal to trio protagonist fans: Banderas, Hopkins and Zeta Jones. Well worth watching.",The Mask of Zorro
8,moonspinner55,Designed to give you whiplash...but who wants a slam-bang Zorro?,3,4 June 2005,"The Zorro legend, slicked up with slam-bang, high-tech, expensive effects, so that it resembles an action-flick or a high-budget martial arts movie. Anthony Hopkins is surprisingly--though nicely--cast as an elderly Zorro passing his skills and knowledge (not to mention his cape and mask!) onto a Latin fugitive who soon becomes a well-trained fighter for the people. The bad guys are hissable, heartless Spaniard officials, sadistic in a cartoonish manner much the same way Antonio Banderas' new Zorro is dopey and yet dashing. There's plenty of sword fights and anachronistically modern jokes, a saucy sideline romance, and it is all very well-made but distressingly unsubtle. All the noisy action Hollywood can dream up can't help this ""Zorro"" escape the feeling there is no real personality at work. It's an epic, all right--but only in generic terms. *1/2 from ****",The Mask of Zorro
9,edwagreen,Magnificent Mask**** of Zorro,10,9 December 2012,"Terrific action-packed adventure with a retired Zorro, Anthony Hopkins, showing the ropes to a young Antonio Banderas. Both wish to extract revenge on the men for the killing of a wife and brother,respectively.Catherine Zeta-Jones was in fine form as Hopkins's real daughter, stolen away by the man who loved her mother and watched her being shot to death accidentally by one of the soldiers.The story is wonderful with some history of Santa Ana in California.The dueling sequences are terrific as Banderas quickly learns the techniques from the pro Hopkins.How can you miss with a picture where the villain wants to buy California from Santa Ana and pay for it by using the latter's gold and enslaving people in the process to extract it?",The Mask of Zorro
10,sunwarrior13,A Fun And Delightful Entertaining Film,8,16 October 2012,"The Mask of Zorro is a swashbuckler film based on the Zorro character created by Johnston McCulley. It was directed by Martin Campbell and stars Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Stuart Wilson. In the story, the original Zorro escapes from prison to find his long-lost daughter and avenge the death of his wife against the corrupt governor. He is aided by his successor that also pursues his own vendetta.With scenic 18th century Mexico as a backdrop,Don Diego de la Vega, intent on revenge after rival enemy Don Raphael Montero murdered his wife and took his daughter, Elena. After being imprisoned for 20 years, the fabled hero removes his mask and takes on a tarnished young apprentice, Alejandro Murieta, to infiltrate Montero's plan to take control of California from Santa Anna. A boisterous outlaw with his own desire for revenge, Murieta works with Diego to avenge his brother's death by the sword of Montero's right-hand man, Captain Harrison Love. After Diego's extensive training in sword fighting, discipline and manners, a new Zorro appears wreaking vengeance and stealing the heart of a now-grown Elena.Buckling the swash in a way approaching Errol Flynn, Antonio Banderas is up for the action and handles the slapstick as the inept student with aplomb. The romance between him and Catherine Zeta-Jones has sparks, too.The screenplay follows the predictable paths of action movies, but re-energizes the pattern with adrenaline, exuberance, creativity, and humor.It's self-consciously stylized and unapologetically escape movie but it results into an entertaining,fun and delightful one as well.",The Mask of Zorro
11,studioAT,Zorro!,4,16 September 2017,"Applying many of the tricks they would use later for 'Pirates of the Caribbean' writers Ted Elliott & Terry Rossio combine with 'Goldeneye' director, Martin Campbell to bring the legendary hero Zorro to the big screen.It's an entertaining film, with lots of good moments. Antonio Banderas is good fun as Zorro, while I liked the dynamic he had with Anthony Hopkins's character too.It's perhaps a bit overlong, but on the whole this was a good attempt to bring the hero to life for a modern audience.",The Mask of Zorro
12,hitchcockthelegend,High definition a necessity for this delightful homage to swash bucklers.,8,30 May 2009,"Zorro senior tutors Zorro junior in the way of the blade, their combined goal? To enact revenge on Don Rafael Montero and Capt. Harrison Love respectively.Martin Campbell was an interesting and wise choice for this latest take on the swashbuckling heroics of the Latin Robin Hood. Campbell was the man in the director's chair for both of James Bond's reinvigoration's, firstly with ""Golden Eye"" in 1995, and then with ""Casino Royale"" in 2006. For here it's evident that The Mask Of Zorro has no delusions of grandeur in the pantheon of cinema, it wants (and is) to be an action film with pure fantastical flamboyance pouring from practically every frame. It honours the swashers of old by ensuring all genre boxes are ticked, yep, we got swords a plenty, yep, we got a dashing hero (x 2 actually), yep, we got a spiffing looking villain, and yes we got a heaving bosom led romance into the mix as well. While Campbell and his team of screenwriters gleefully ensure that humour is a very prominent thing, thus keeping the fantasy in the comic book realm from which Zorro's essence comes.The stunt work on show is top draw, none more so than during a horse chase sequence where this Zorro tips its hat to former glorious genre pieces (well done Tony Angelotti). Other notable technical aspects deserve a mention, the costumes from Graciela Mazón are desirable and now in this age of High Definition Cinema, good make up work really comes to the fore, so it be that that department did sterling work on this picture (check out Elena's gorgeous face). The cast are basically very strong, Antonio Banderas slips into the Zorro cape with charming ease, and though it's nice to see a Spanish actor playing the famous Spanish character, here in this adaptation the irony is that Zorro is Mexican! Anthony Hopkins is as elegant as ever as the elder, newly retired Zorro AKA: Don Diego de la Vega, and Catherine Zeta Jones is positively ravishing as Elena, while Stuart Wilson does a nice line in pompous villainy as Don Rafael Montero.Some minor complaints do dwell within the picture. Campbell has a lot to fit into a running time of two hours and twenty odd minutes, and this makes the wait for the rip roaring finale longer than one at first wished for. Though for sure let it be noted that the gold mine action bonanza at pics end is totally worth the wait. Weak in the cast is Matt Letscher as Captain Love, oddly looking like some Kiefer Sutherland tribute act, he lacks any real menace for what is a pretty well written role. James Horner's score lacks the necessary boom boom bang bang that someone like Alfred Newman would have provided, and a comedy horse strand pushes the boundaries of acceptable genre homages a little too far.But really why moan and groan at irks that don't alter the trajectory of The Mask Of Zorro's blade? It isn't trying to do anything other than whisk you along for a blade swashing ride, and that is something that it most assuredly succeeds in doing. 8/10",The Mask of Zorro
13,Theo Robertson,Old Fashioned Entertainment With That Has Little American Involvement,7,14 August 2005,"This gets off to a very impressive start where a trio of peasants are about to be executed on trumped up charges and Zorro appears to save the day . Normally I'd be rather uneasy seeing violence portrayed in such a knock about off hand manner but the action scenes in THE MASK OF ZORRO are something of an exception as the swashbuckling hero notches up an unlikely death toll against the military oppressors . It's all done with a panache as the audience are not asked but told to pick sides of good versus evil It's a very black and white morality tale , ridiculously black and white and oh so very old fashioned but I certainly did enjoy the way the story was told . It has a beautifully paced script that's packed with sword fights and acrobatics and amazingly I don't recall one single scene involving CGI . Are you listening Mr Hollywood producer ? You don't need CGI to make a successful Summer blockbuster , all you need are some film makers who know how to tell an enthralling story Perhaps I should point out that two of the lead actors are from Wales and that one is from Spain , along with the director being from New Zealand while the editor and cinematographer are British . Are these facts intertwined with my enjoyment of THE MASK OF ZORRO ? Certainly Hopkins , Zeta-Jones and Banderas bring their characters to life on screen and if big name American stars had been cast I think we'd have a rather inferior movie . Hopefully Hollywood producers can watch this - And LORD OF THE RINGS - and realise too much American involvement in front and behind the cameras can often be a bad thing . It's nice to see a movie like this where one of the main villains is an American",The Mask of Zorro

15,zardoz-13,"Z Best ""Zorro"" Since Tyrone Power's ""Zorro!""",9,6 September 2008,"Like The Lone Ranger, he wears a mask to conceal his identity. Like Batman, he hides his crime busting regalia in a secret place. Like The Phantom, he rides a spirited stallion. His wizardry with a bullwhip rivals Indiana Jones. He sports a cape like Superman. Like The Shadow, he is a wealthy gentleman who leads a highly visible public life and shuns violence. Like James Bond, he exudes enough debonair charm to leave the ladies swooning. Named after the elusive fox, he is Zorro! Zorro lives to thwart injustice, corruption, and tyranny. Watching ""GoldenEye"" director Martin Campbell's classy but drawn-out swashbuckler ""The Mask of Zorro"" with Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, you'd think Zorro was a cross-section of those heroic crime busters. Actually, you'd be mistaken. The creators of ""The Lone Ranger, Batman, Superman, The Shadow, Indiana Jones, and James Bond drew their inspiration from Zorro. For the record, Canadian born novelist Johnston McCulley created the Zorro character in 1919, and the Hispanic hero made his first appearance in the serialized story ""The Curse of Capistrano"" in ""All-Story Weekly,"" a the pulp magazine. Like a good legendary crime buster movie, ""The Mask of Zorro"" encapsulates Zorro's motivation. The affluent Don Diego de la Vega (Anthony Hopkins of ""Instinct"") resorts to mask, cap, sword, and whip to defend the helpless, put-upon peasantry. Scenarists John Esckow, Ted Elliot, and Terry Rossio have written ""Zorro"" as if it were an old-fashioned tale. Audiences must pay attention to their multi-dimensional storyline to appreciate the intricate, elaborately woven action. Moreover, director Martin Campbell translates the scripted word into cinematic verse. ""Zorro"" emerges as such a literate action yarn that you may find yourself enjoying it equally for its mental as well as physical stimulation. The only hitch to ""Zorro"" is that Campbell and his writers never know when to stop. ""Zorro"" is a runaway horse, not that it matters much. ""Zorro"" is one of those movies where each scene contributes to the headlong momentum of the story. What a lot of people may miss after they finish watching ""Zorro"" is that ""Zorro"" is a tragedy wrapped up in a romantic adventure.Consider the splendid introductory gambit. In 1821, villainous Spanish Governor Don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson of ""Lethal Weapon 3"") faces exile. Before departing, he devises one last trap to capture Zorro. Decked out in black as 'the fox,' Don Diego takes the bait. He rescues three innocent peasants from a firing squad, and then eludes an army of Don Rafael's bumbling troops. Swinging gallantly around on his handy bullwhip, Zorro pauses on Rafael's balcony and carves a Z into his throat. Framed in a heroic sunset, Zorro gallops home to tell his baby daughter Elena about his exploits. Later, Rafael shows up without warning at Vega's hacienda. Opening a wound that Vega acquired at the execution, Rafael unmasks Vega as Zorro. A fight ensues, and a cretinous soldier accidentally kills Vega's gorgeous wife Esperanza (Julieta Rosen of ""Perfect Target""). Don Rafael had lusted after Esperanza, so he furiously impales the poor soldier on his sword. Not only does Don Rafael imprison Vega, but he also abducts baby Elena! Indeed, ""Zorro"" features a dastardly villain that you can truly boo-hiss!Twenty years elapse, and Don Rafael returns to California. He proposes a daring scheme to steal California from Spanish General Santa Anna by selling it to him for secret gold stashed in a nearby Spanish mine. Cleverly, Rafael enlists the aid of the greedy landowners. The ghost of Zorro/Vega still haunts Rafael, so he scours Mexico's smelly dungeons to find Vega. Rafael fears that Zorro may thwart his plan. Vega manages to escape during Rafael's inspection when his fellow inmates step forward to claim Zorro's identity. Genuine class distinguishes Zorro from his cinematic competitors. The smoothly handled violence is never gratuitous and rarely profane. Best of all, the swordplay is elegant but stimulating. This is the first good example of saber-slashing since director Richard Lester made ""The Three Musketeers"" and ""The Four Musketeers"" in the 1970s. ""Zorro"" constitutes a lively throwback to the way literate adventure sagas were produced. Indeed, director Martin Campbell revitalized James Bond in ""GoldenEye,"" and ""The Mask of Zorro"" resembles an elaborately plotted, often indulgent 007 epic where story matters as much as action. In an opening similar to the Bond franchise, Zorro marches on screen. Whipping out his sword, he slashes a huge signature Z with three broad, swift strokes. Flames engulf the screen and the narration begins. Although the body count remains comparably low, ""The Mask of Zorro"" should keep action-oriented guys of all ages satisfied women will gravitate to ""Zorro"" for Hispanic hunk Antonio Banderas. Banderas performs his sword fighting chores credibly enough, and he gets a couple of chances to woo Elena. Reining in the sexuality to obtain a PG-13 rating, the filmmakers rely entirely on Catherine Zeta-Jones' modesty and pulchritude as the adult Elena. Essentially, Jones displays only cleavage. She has no nude scenes. She engages Zorro in an entertaining sword fight scene in the stables as well as an erotically charged dance number.Periodically, ""Zorro"" pokes fun at its hero. While the filmmakers have fun at the expense of Banderas' ""Zorro,"" they succeed in making Zorro both human and sympathetic. ""Zorro"" loses a modicum of its spontaneity to its cumbersome length and its overwritten script. Indisputably, ""The Mask of Zorro"" ranks as Z-best Zorro movie since Twentieth Century Fox's ""The Mark of Zorro"" (1940) with Tyrone Power. ""Titanic"" composer James Horner provides stirring, toe and heel tapping Spanish music that enhances both the action and the atmosphere. Thankfully, ""The Mark of Zorro"" is one summer movie without a succession of heavy metal, hip-hop, rap, or country music tunes decimating the end credits. If performance and plot matter in your choice of action adventure films, ""The Mark of Zorro"" qualifies as ideal entertainment.",The Mask of Zorro
16,Boba_Fett1138,Good entertainment!,8,6 June 2004,"Martin Campbell sure knows how to make entertaining movies. After making ""No Escape"" and ""GoldenEye"" he brings us yet another entertaining movie; ""The Mask of Zorro"". He actually used to be one of my favorite directors after seeing those movies I just named but unfortunately he hasn't made anything good lately. Let's hope this change after completing ""Zorro 2"" that is currently being made.""The Mask of Zorro"" is just some good old fashioned fun with lot's of spectacular moments, good choreographed fight sequences, a love story and a good old fashioned stereotype villain.The story is told in a good way which I think is mainly thanks to Campbell's directing. The pace is high and the combination between the action, the characters and their relations, romance and some of the comical moments is done very well, unlike some other movies from the same genre.There is some nice cinematography that help to create a good atmosphere along with the musical score from James Horner. The end fight is good and it has a spectacular big explosion in it that'll make you go; Wow!Great entertainment for the whole family.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Mask of Zorro
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Too much of a parody of the character, but surprisingly good",7,30 September 2004,"I can't say I've ever really been a fan of Zorro. As a child, I was fascinated by fencing, but never Zorro himself, as a character or a legend. However, my love for fencing kept growing, and that is the main reason that I sat down to watch this movie, as it came on TV; to see some good, well-choreographed swordplay. However, despite my sincerest efforts, I couldn't manage to sit through the entire thing. Maybe it's because the film takes the legend of Zorro and tries to make fun of it; maybe it's because the film was overlong and poorly paced; or maybe I just care too little about the whole Zorro thing to sit through a movie about him... I've never seen any of the other Zorro films(as far as I can remember, at least), so I can't really say if this is as good or better than any other version. The plot is decent enough, but it drags too much and the film is too long. It lasts about 2 hours and 15 minutes; I think I looked at the film for a collective 30-45 minutes. The rest seemed dull and the film quickly lost my interest and attention. The acting is good; the three leads, Hopkins, Bandera and Zeta-Jones all give great performances... or, at least they did, for most of what little of the film I payed attention to. The characters are somewhat one-dimensional, especially Banderas' Zorro. Very goofy and humorous, but that's about as deep he gets. Hopkins really shines, though, as always, and Zeta-Jones really lights up the screen for every second she's on-screen. The sword-fights are well-choreographed and intense, but most of the rest of the action is a bit of a let-down. I don't know if it was the direction, the writing or just the overall kiddie-like PG tone of the whole film, but something just seemed to be dragging the film down. It is saved by entertaining dialog between Hopkins and Banderas, as well as the beauty and talent of Zeta-Jones and the exciting and well-choreographed sword-fights. That's about it, though. Not much else worth watching in this film. I recommend it only to big fans of Zorro(or, maybe they are the ones who should avoid it most of all, seeing as how it's almost a parody on the character) or any of the main actors. Big fans of fencing might also want to check it out, provided that they can do so for free. I once considered renting this movie, and now I'm thanking myself I didn't. If you can watch it for free, consider it. If not, just don't watch it. It's mildly entertaining but hardly memorable. I gave it a 7/10, purely for entertainment value and acting talent. 7/10",The Mask of Zorro
18,view_and_review,"Funny, Charming, and Exciting",7,21 November 2020,"My childhood memories of Zorro are very few and now very fuzzy, so I can't accurately compare what I remember of Zorro in the early 80's and ""The Mask of Zorro."" No matter, this movie was good. It was funny, charming, and exciting.The year was 1821 and Spain was being driven out of Mexico by General Santa Anna. One Spanish man by the name of Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson) refused to leave and was a menace to the people. Zorro the elder was Don Diego De La Vega (Anthony Hopkins) and he was the people's champ until he was found out. Montero killed De La Vega's wife and kidnapped his baby daughter and raised her as his own while De La Vega languished in prison.20 years later De La Vega would escape from prison and train a new Zorro to continue the legacy and perhaps stop Montero from his nefarious plans. The new Zorro was Alejandro Murrieta (Antonio Banderas) and he had enough anger to be a Zorro, he only lacked the ability.Banderas was excellent. He fell into the role naturally. Hopkins was a bit of a misplacement as a swordsman and fighter, but Hopkins is such a good actor he gets a pass. Of course we got some romance between Banderas and Zeta-Jones who played De La Vega's adult daughter Elena. I think this movie was done right. It was refreshing to see an action movie without endless bullets and explosions. I'd like to see more action movies set in pre-automatic weapons days.",The Mask of Zorro

But Senor Banderas is refreshingly funny as well, playing up his smoldering Latin lover qualities while not taking himself too seriously.Catherine Zeta-Jones, back then just a hot bombshell, made her presence known to movie audiences for the first time in any major way.The film scored two minor Oscar nominations, for Best Sound and Best Sound Effects Editing.Grade: B+",The Mask of Zorro
20,morrison-dylan-fan,My favourite film of all time.,10,5 August 2012,"When deciding to go and watch a movie at the cinema,I have always found,that whilst I remember a lot about the film itself,I most of the time rarely remember much about the surroundings that I watched the movie in.In the middle of 1998,I somehow noticed a mistake,which actually played to my advantage,when I opened the case of a recently brought second hand video,and discovered that instead of the film itself being inside,the contents of the case was a ""blank"" Video.Seeing that I would have to wait for at least a week until the market was on again,I decided to play the ""blank"" Video,and quickly discovered that it contained a program shown on an obscure Sky TV channel in the early 90's called ""Zorro"".As the second of the two episodes from the Duncan Regehr Zorro (which after being left in the wilderness for almost 20 years,has at last been brought out in a huge DVD boxset) began,I started to become very interested in finding any other TV shows/movies related to Zorro.After having almost completely worn out the Zorro tape,I ended up getting the best news that I could have possible heard in 1998,when I found out that a brand new Zorro movie was being shown at a local,community cinema.(A cinema,that 9 years later I would have the pleasure of being a projectionist at as a ""summer job"") With still having memories of being completely awe-struck when watching the film at the cinema,I began to wonder if the movie would still leave me with a sense of wonder,after having last watched the film on an imported (thank you Ebay seller!) video 7 years agoView on the film:Watching the making of doc ,I was stunned to discover how much trouble there had been of in getting the film made,with the movie originally having been planned for the early 90's,and director's Robert Rodriguez,Mikael Salomon and even Stanly Kubrick!, (who tried his best to get Julio Medem agree to directing the film) all falling to get the project into production.With the hands that had gone through to getting the movie made,I have to say,that seeing the film again after so many years,I was astonished at the unbelievable pace that the screenplay (written by Randall Johnson,John Eskow,Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio) flies by.Keeping away from dragging this wonderful movie into a needless,overly complex mythology,the writers cleverly use the opening to show Zorro in a glorious mythical light that shines for the whole running time.After having shown Zorro in a heroic light,the writers brilliantly rip up everything that de la Vega holds dear,until he is left with the only option of transforming a worn down,wannabe thief into being a hero for the people.Backed by Martin Campbell's tremendously warm directing that looks to have come straight from the pages of a long forgotten Romantic Adventure novel,the ensemble cast give the perfect mix of comedic touches and gravitas,with Antonio Banderas (who also did almost all of the breath taking stunts himself) brilliantly making Murrieta's gradually transformation from theft to hero in waiting feel like a natural progression for the character.Pushing Murrieta to breaking point,Anthony Hopkins smartly makes sure that the burden from the tragedies is felt,whist also showing a shine in the eyes for being the hero of the people that he once was.",The Mask of Zorro
21,anaconda-40658,Zorro's Great Epic.,9,5 August 2015,"The Mask of Zorro (1998): Dir: Martin Campbell / Cast: Antonio Banderas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Anthony Hopkins, Stuart Wilson, Matt Letscher: Surprisingly successful film about the legacy and secret regarding the mask that shields the identity of Zorro. Anthony Hopkins plays an ageing Zorro who witnesses the murder of his wife and abduction of his son. Twenty years pass and he frees himself from captivity and sets out to train someone to carry on the legacy. Well written setup branches into well placed humour before climaxing with typical action. Directed by Martin Campbell who previously made the exhilarating 007 film Goldeneye. Hopkins is an appropriate ageing Zorro out to avenge the wrong done to his family as well as continue his legacy through another. Antonio Banderas is on target as young Zorro with a lot of great humour to boot. Stuart Wilson plays the villain who causes the tension then sets out upon a new scheme until his past returns to haunt him in the form of a black mask. Catherine Zeta-Jones shows grace and wit as she begins to recall her past that her mind had blocked out. Matt Letscher plays another villain whose murderous nature is targeted for termination. The purpose is to bring the popular comic book to screen but unlike many of its kind, this film plays out its pointless charade with a great deal of grand humour and sword play.

22,HotToastyRag,'90s Masterpiece,8,18 December 2017,"If you missed seeing The Mask of Zorro in the theaters, you missed out on a key milestone of a childhood in the '90s. I remember sitting on the edge of my seat watching what was probably the first action movie I'd ever seen, falling in love with Antonio Banderas's wavy hair and Catherine Zeta-Jones's exquisitely beautiful face. Was there ever a more beautiful screen couple? Well, in 1998 I didn't think so, and the magic of childhood remembrance puts such a glow around them that no other screen couple will probably be able to touch them.In this film version of legend of the masked hero, Zorro is captured at the beginning of the movie. The bad guy, Stuart Wilson, grows his power for twenty years, until Zorro escapes from jail. The problem is, Anthony Hopkins is Zorro, and he's far too old to return to his swashbuckling days. The only solution is to find and train a new Zorro so that the legend will continue and justice will prevail. I'll never forget the exciting and grueling training sequence between Anthony Hopkins and Antonio Banderas: it's a sequence between two good guys, but it's still just as thrilling as the action scenes later on in the film!Moviegoers who like swashbuckling movies, action flicks, or historical romances will love The Mask of Zorro. Antonio lives a double life, since no one knows the true identity of the masked avenger, and he's funny, daring, and charming as he woos Catherine-with and without the mask. There are political discussions, romantic tensions, and incredible fight and action scenes. This thrilling '90s masterpiece is not to be missed-even if you're seeing it for the first time as a grown-up, I'm sure you'll love it.",The Mask of Zorro
23,FlashCallahan,I've never lost a fight.....,8,1 March 2015,"Zorro saves three men from the fleeing Spanish Governor but is followed to his home where his wife is killed and his infant daughter taken and is imprisoned. Twenty years later, he escapes and finds his daughter has been raised as the governor's child. Vowing revenge, he takes a young thief who is also seeking revenge as his apprentice, who will become the new wearer of the Mask of Zorro......As adventure movies go, it's one of the best of the nitrites, and easily the most fun action movie since Temple Of Doom, and the winning formula is thanks to Banderas, because like Ford in Indiana Jones, he is a great hero, but also self deprecating and not afraid to make himself look stupid at times.Campbell proves that he can make really competent action movies. When he's good he's very very good, and when he is bad, he's Green lantern. The man recharged Bond twice, and here he takes an age old hero, makes him fresh and exciting, and also makes Hopkins convincing as a sword fighter.It's a little on the long side, and some of the secondary characters are stereotypical of the setting, but its shortcomings are forgiven for the sheer spectacle of it all.It's a shame that the sequel sank without trace, because this could have been a brilliant franchise.",The Mask of Zorro
24,Aaron1375,"Antonio Banderas makes a rather fine Zorro, however this film is a bit to long.",6,2 August 2010,"This film had some rather entertaining moments in it as it marked a return to the big screen for the mysterious Zorro. The story is a bit different as Zorro is shown at the beginning of the film doing what he does best, unfortunately he is later found out and his wife is killed, his child taken and he is imprisoned. Years later a couple of peasant brothers trying to make their way end up running afoul of a man who kills one of the brothers thus making the other wish for revenge. This man finds the former Zorro and ends up convincing him to train him so that he can get revenge. The film is rather good here and there, but it is sometimes just way to long before there are action scenes. This film runs over two hours and you feel every minute of it. Thankfully, it has a very good action scene at the end of the movie to make up for the long stretches of nothing really happening. The acting is good though as Banderas makes a fine Zorro and Anthony Hopkins plays the role of teacher and former Zorro very well. Catherine Zeta Jones is also good as Zorro's love interest. However, as for the villains they are rather unremarkable and very forgettable. The plot has some issues as well as some of it was just to much, I felt a simpler plot for Zorro's first time out in years was in order. Not a bad film, just needed a shorter run time, better bad guys, and a simpler plot.",The Mask of Zorro
25,Wuchakk,Batman and Indiana Jones in the Wild West,6,16 February 2016,"Released in 1998, ""The Mask of Zorro"" stars Anthony Hopkins as an aging Zorro and Antonio Banderas as an orphaned delinquent with the potential to take over as the hero in early 1840s California. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays the babe while Stuart Wilson and Matt Letscher play the villains.As my title blurb suggests, this movie is like Batman and Indiana Jones in the Wild West; there's even a ""Bat Cave"" (although, I should point out, the character of Zorro pre-dates Batman by 20 years, first appearing in 1919). Like the Indiana Jones movies, this is a fun adventure with thrilling, but eye-rolling scenes. It's nowhere near as good as 1981's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" but it's as good or better than the sequels.While some people praise the opening sequence as one of the best in history, I found it to be the weakest part of the movie. The action and tone are just so unrealistic and cartoony it seriously tempted me to tune out. Thankfully, I kept watching because the story later pulls you in as the wannabe hero tries to prove himself a worthy replacement of the original Zorro. The confessional scene is particularly well done and hooks the viewer. Speaking of which, Zeta-Jones' beauty is just unreal.The film runs 136 minutes and was shot entirely in Mexico.GRADE: B- (6.5/10 Stars)",The Mask of Zorro
26,SimonJack,Good modern tale of the fox of Old California,8,6 January 2017,"From the late 1940s through the 1950s, town theaters across mid-America at least, had Saturday matinée shows for kids. We had a second theater in my hometown that always showed Westerns – usually double features. Before TV became widespread, that's how kids saw many of the older Westerns and other films. And, that's where I saw my earliest Zorro movies. By the time the Zorro TV series was on the air, 1957-59, I was in high school, but I still watched it once in a while with my younger brothers. We were all wrapped up in Zorro, The Cisco Kid, The Lone Ranger, Roy Rogers, Gene Autry and Hopalong Cassidy. The modern recreations of those old Westerns have much more glamour and glitz along with the color. I wonder if kids today see the stories and heroes quite the same way as kids did of a couple generations ago. Still, those of us who grew up with the originals can enjoy the modern takes and different stars in the roles. This 1998 reprisal of the ""Robin Hood"" of Old California, has some different twists. But, it is a good action follow-up to the 1940 film, ""The Mark of Zorro."" Although a couple of silent films, and one other talking picture had been made before, the 1940 film entrenched the masked caballero as a Western hero on film. Tyrone Power starred as Don Diego de la Vaga. Zorro had been highly popular in serialized articles and then books by Johnston McCulley since 1919. Now he was assured of longevity for future generations of kids, young and old. Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones are very good in their lead roles. Anthony Hopkins is very good in his role, which is a twist on the original stories. With its swashbuckling action, ""The Mask of Zorro"" and is a good modern tale of the fox of early California days.",The Mask of Zorro
27,Mr-Fusion,Grand old Hollywood action,7,14 July 2015,"If ""The Mask of Zorro"" has any deficiencies, they certainly aren't in the charm department. This movie's got charisma out the yin-yang, and not just with Anthony Hopkins and Antonio Banderas (perfect casting here) but also in the action; exciting swordfights, wicked double entendre and endearing heroism. I haven't seen this in a good 15 years and it holds up admirably. Swashbuckling movies don't come down the pike often, and it's nice when they're done so well. And even if it didn't succeed on the entertainment front, it still has a formidable secret weapon: the absurdly stunning Catherine Zeta Jones. My, god she's something else.7/10",The Mask of Zorro

Catherine Zeta-Jones, (Elana)""Chicago"",'02 performed a very torrid Spanish dance and was extremely HOT during the entire picture. Elana almost lost her underwear with the swift blades of the newly taught young ZORRO introduced in this film.  This is a very refreshing new approach to the Zorro image and is a must see film !",The Mask of Zorro
29,JamesHitchcock,The Modern Errol Flynn,7,13 May 2006,"The story of the Californian hero Zorro has much in common with the legend of Robin Hood. Both Diego de la Vega and Robert of Locksley are aristocrats, but both choose to side with the common people in their fight against injustice and oppression by foreign overlords, be they the Norman conquerors of England or the Spanish colonial rulers of California. Both men, at least in the cinematic versions of the legend, are expert swordsmen. Traditionally, of course, Robin Hood was more associated with the longbow than the sword, but the producers of adventure movies have always known that sword-fights make for exciting cinema. Hence the famous duel between Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (or, for that matter, all those light-sabres in ""Star Wars""). Similarly, Zorro still clings to his trusty blade, even though the stories are set at a time in the nineteenth century when serious differences were settled by the gun and swords were largely confined to ceremonial uses and ritualistic duelling.This particular version of the story begins in 1821 when Mexico (which at this date still included California) is about to gain its independence from Spain. Zorro rescues three men from being executed by the evil Spanish governor, Don Rafael Montero, but is recognised as being Diego de la Vega, a man against whom Montero has long held a grudge. Zorro is arrested at his home and in the struggle his wife Esperanza is killed. Montero kidnaps his daughter Elena and raises her as his own.The action then leaps forward twenty years to 1841, when Zorro manages to escape after a long imprisonment. Montero has now returned to California as the leader of a conspiracy to escape from Mexican rule and to form an independent republic with himself as dictator. He has discovered a rich source of gold which he is secretly mining. Although this gold is the property of the Mexican government, they are unaware of its existence, and Montero intends to use it to buy California's independence from a government desperate for funds to finance its war against the Americans. In order to thwart this plot and to avenge the death of his wife, Zorro finds a young man, Alejandro, who has a grudge against Montero whose henchman Captain Love was responsible for the death of his brother, and trains him in the art of sword-fighting to take his place as the new Zorro.The film is in many ways similar to the recent sequel, ""The Legend of Zorro"". Both are swashbuckling adventure stories with a likable hero in Antonio Banderas's Alejandro and a ravishingly beautiful heroine in Catherine Zeta Jones's Elena. Elena is not just the hero's love interest (inevitably, she and Alejandro end up falling for each other), but also a heroine in her own right, a fearless and resourceful lady who is as skilled with a sword as he is. Catherine has never looked lovelier than she does here. The earlier film is, however, the better one. It has a second hero in Anthony Hopkins's de la Vega, who brings to the role a dignity and gravitas lacking in the sequel, in which he does not appear. It is not as blithely unconcerned with historical accuracy as the second film, although there are still one or two errors.(The leader of the Mexican nationalist rebel armies in 1821 was not Santa Anna but Iturbide; Mexico was not at war with the USA in 1841 as the Mexican-American War did not break out until 1846).More importantly, there is a significant difference in the political tone of the two films. The sequel is dominated by a rather paranoid post-9/11 patriotism, with Zorro becoming a heroic defender of America against a dastardly foreign conspiracy to blow up the nation's capital. This tone is fortunately absent from the original film. Rather, its ethos is what Roger Ebert describes as a ""sense of honour"". Zorro is the representative of truth and decency, the righter of wrongs, the champion of the weak against the strong. (The climax comes when Zorro has to prevent Montero and his henchmen from not only destroying the mine but also blowing up all the miners with it, in order to conceal the evidence of their illegal gold-mining). This is not the film to go to if you are looking for deep analysis of moral issues or great psychological depth. As a modern version of those old Errol Flynn swashbuckling adventures, however, it is excellent. 7/10",The Mask of Zorro
30,Smells_Like_Cheese,"I have some questions, but I still was amused by The Mask of Zorro",7,25 November 2006,"I'm not really into Zorro or the story, but my mom has been trying to convince me for a couple years to give The Mask of Zorro a shot, and I do love Antonio Bandares and Catherine Zeta Jones, so I figured to be fair and give The Mask of Zorro a fair shot. And over all, I'd say that The Mask of Zorro is no doubt fast paced and packed with action and romance, Catherine and Antonio had a great connection and passion that sizzled on screen. Although, my question is mainly Anthony Hopkins, ENGLAND's popular actor as a Spaniard? Alrighty then! Zorro is Anthony Hopkins at first, but when he is seized and his wife is killed and his daughter is taken away from his sworn enemy as if she were his daughter, Anthony after 20 years in prison finally escapes and finds a thief, Antonio Bandares and trains him as the new Zorro that the people need. Once he sees Anthony's daughter, Catherine Zeta Jones, it is love at first sight, but she does not know still that Anthony is her real father and the man who raised her is destroying the state of California.I would recommend this movie for a night with friends, it over all was a good movie to watch. I loved the fight between Catherine and Anotonio, it was so awesome and so passionate, these two really did an awesome job. Once you get past and accept Anthony as a Spanard, I think you'll do fine with the movie.7/10",The Mask of Zorro

Banderas was and is perfect for this role and his performance is phenomenal in the film.I recommend this film to those that love Swashbuckling Action Films and/or Adventurous Westerns.

32,Robert_duder,A rip roaring interpretation of the legendary hero,9,19 February 2006,"The writers and director and crew of The Mask of Zorro hit every mark exactly when creating the most recent entry (and there has been many over the years...none of which I have seen except for a series in the eighties or nineties.) A witty and interesting script, great actors, cutting edge sword fights, and a beautiful lush setting of eighteen hundred California before it's statehood. Zorro has always been a unique savior with a great back story and this film embraces much of it.First off bringing on the incomparable Anthony Hopkins to play the aged and much retired Don Diego de la Vega, the original Zorro, was an absolute stroke of genius. I mean not only does Hopkins automatically up the ante of any film but the role is brilliant and genius. I don't know how much was stunt double but his performance in the beginning of his last ride as Zorro is brilliant and believable and Hopkins plays a tortured sole and former hero perfectly. Enter former wanted thief Alejandro Murrieta played by Antonio Banderas in one of his best roles hands down as the swashbuckling Zorro. He was absolutely built for this role and he is brilliant as Zorro and as his alter ego although he only really takes on his alter ego once. Banderas is the first Spanish American to actually portray Zorro ever in history and he's perfect. He's the exact copy of what you would picture the hero. His back story from thief to Californian protector is interesting and well performed by him every step. Hopkins as his trainer and teacher and mentor is the perfect match and they have incredible chemistry and Banderas matches Hopkins' on screen presence completely. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Elena, Hopkins' estranged daughter taken from him as a baby by his mortal enemy and also Banderas' love interest. She's feisty and a great fighter and some real spirit. Her and Banderas fit each other and have incredible romantic chemistry and their romance is done in very good speed and unfolds nicely as they are pitted against each other as well as together. Stuart Wilson rounds out the cast as the especially underhanded Don Rafael Montero. He's quite good as Hopkins' adversary both in the past and present, and he's great at playing the incredibly evil and also diplomatic sides of his character. Each character has an important part in the film and they get an equally watchable and integral part of the story and everything you hope for each of them unfolds.Martin Campbell, who is no stranger to action films as well as riveting stories does a great job at putting together this incredible action/comedy/adventure film. I think it truly will go down as a classic in the same vein as Indiana Jones, and Superman. I can only hope the 2nd installment is even remotely as good as this one. It would be very difficult to pull of considering so much of the story is done in this one. The setting of eighteen hundred Mexican culture is done exactly the way it needed to be for Zorro and his heroic adventures are worth watching again and again. It has everything you could possibly want and more, a rip roaring action film that adventure lovers will love!! Check it out!! 9/10",The Mask of Zorro

34,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Fear me, if you dare.",7,26 March 2020,"'The Mask Of Zorro (1998)' is a swashbuckling adventure that sees the 'Zorro' mantle passed down from Hopkins' Don Diego de la Vega to Banderas' Alejandro Murrieta. Even though the latter is who springs to mind when you think of the character, the former gets a huge amount of screen-time. Thankfully, the actual training that goes on is brushed over refreshingly quickly, making this 'origin story' slightly less generic than expected. It does conform to its genre rather heavily, but it's an absolutely solid film regardless. It's the kind of movie that proves clichés are clichés for a reason: they work. On top of this, it feels old-school in the best of ways. It captures the 'adventure serial' aspect of its source material rather well, clearly being inspired by 'Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981)' and itself inspiring 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: The Curse Of The Black Pearl (2003)'. It's a lot of fun, with fantastically tangible set-pieces and a perfectly balanced tone. Two of its most noticeable issues are the obvious stunt performers and the fact that Hopkins' character is supposed to be Spanish. In the grand scheme of things, they're not really a big deal. The performances are absolutely solid and the stunt-work is impeccable, too. The flick slows down somewhat in its mid-section but it picks back up again for an excellent finale. It's also interesting that its A and B plots are pretty much inseparable; it's difficult to say exactly which is which, to be honest. Overall, the experience is just enjoyable. It's a really good time and that's what matters most. 7/10",The Mask of Zorro

And then you get to this piece of junk. A ""high concept"" exercise in insanity. Could this be what happened ....

You would think with the charming cast,Zorro would be an entertaining romp,but a lot of actors seemed to be slumming it on autopilot so to speak,especially Anthony Hopkins. Some of the sword fights were spectacular some of them were just plain dull,and that was one of this film's main problems it's inconsistency. It's lavish looking,it certainly had the right cast along with some decent humor,but too often I was in the middle of being entertained then slowly getting bored at what was going on,the inconsistent pacing ruined it. Stuart Gordon makes a great fiendish villain to be sure,and there are some great little comic bits|De La Vega telling Alejandro he has BO is one| but it missed out on so much potential. It's a little overlong at 136 minutes too,by the time the big showdown came at the finale it was too little too late for me,the choreography was well done and all, it was just dull. I will say this though,the film does make Zeta Jone's character likable in this film,unlike the 2nd where she becomes a snotty witch for a lot of the film. I'm not saying The Mask Of Zorro is a complete failure or anything,it had quite a few entertaining moments it's just much too inconsistent.The Performances. Antonio Banderas has to play the heart of the film in the 2nd half,he does OK but stumbles a lot,because his charm only gets him so far performance wise. His chemistry with Hopkins was very good as it was with Zeta-Jones,but he often came across as a buffoon more then a believable hero type,thankfully the sequel improved this problem. Anthony Hopkins is good,but you can clearly tell he's slumming it,this was a paycheck film for him and it showed,that's not to say though I didn't enjoy it cause I certainly did. He's so suave and charismatic you can't help but be glued to the screen whenever he shows up,for me he made the film and slumming it or not I'd like to be that good while slumming. Catherine Zeta-Jones is very charming and quite stunning to look at,and unlike most of the sequel she's a very likable heroine. Stuart Wilson plays a wonderful villain usually and here is no different. He oozes class and often stole many of the scenes he was in,I really loved a lot of his and Hopkins banter. Matt Letscher is very good as the henchman,you will hate him.Bottom Line-The Mask Of Zorro is OK,definitely not as good as it could have been,but it also could've been a lot worse. The charming cast helps it out a lot,that being said I was still quite disappointed with the overall production. Worth the watch but don't get too hyped up about it.6/10",The Mask of Zorro

41,filipemanuelneto,One of the best adventure films of the nineties.,10,23 January 2020,"In this film, the legend of Zorro, a Mexican masked hero who fights for justice against oppressive Spaniards, comes to life. And the film is excellent in all aspects. Here, the story of the film is intertwined with political intrigues involving the independence of the Republic of California and the American desire to expand from coast to coast.The story is interesting and gives us good moments of romance and adventure. The time when everything happens is interesting and shows the decline of the Spanish Empire and the expansion of the USA. It is a historical time that allows for excellent costumes and scenery, and it was very well portrayed, almost as a compliment to Hispanic culture. Of course, there are certain things that didn't go so well and the historical details of the sets and costumes can be the subject of some debate.António Banderas gained fame and projection, in good part, with this film. Besides being a handsome man, he showed talent and did a good job as an actor. Good moments of action, good sword fights and a certain rebellious boldness characterize his character and the actor was able to meet what was asked of him. Another very evident and very well accomplished thing was the intense chemistry with Catherine Zeta-Jones, with whom he acted and made a romantic pair. She, in turn, was also very well here, exuding sensuality and personality. Next to them, Anthony Hopkins, always impeccable. Stuart Wilson and Matt Letscher are good at villain roles and do their job very well here.In addition to the very good scenarios and costumes, the film has good cinematography, good colors, an elegant light, good fights, good action and a permanent sense of adventure help this film to become pleasant and even memorable. In fact, it was one of the best adventure films of the nineties.",The Mask of Zorro

45,Vartiainen,Great popcorn fun,8,26 January 2016,"Many a movie has been made about Zorro, but nowadays this is probably, if not the most well-known, then at least very close. And for a good reason. It's a great movie that introduces the legendary character to new audiences while also pleasing those that are already familiar with him. It's entertaining, full of great action scenes as well as great characters, has a plot that's just perfect for a summer blockbuster and has a good cast of actors to pull it all off.And while I do think that the plot is just simple enough for a blockbuster adventure swashbuckler film such as this one, I do enjoy its subtle touches. Like the fact that our Zorro this time around is the fictional brother of a real-life Mexican outlaw Joaquín Murrieta or that he is opposed by Harrison Love, who's based on a real-life army man named Harry Love. And the very real conflict between Mexico, California and United States works as the background of it all.The film is also very good at building mythos. The very fact that the original Zorro has grown old and is forced to train a replacement for himself is a great plot hook that allows the film to distance itself from the original stories and build a storyline of its own, while still also giving as all the traditional Zorro moments that we love. Anthony Hopkins plays Diego de la Vega, and while it is a bit distracting whenever he's forced to play the younger Zorro in flashbacks, he is very good as an aged nobleman turned outlaw.Likewise, Antonia Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones shine as the protagonist and his love interest. Both are capable of filling their roles with both the charisma and the humour that these kinds of movies require, and they have good screen chemistry together.The Mask of Zorro is one of my favourite swashbuckling films. It keeps you entertained from start to finish and is filled with enough content to allow you to see it over and over again. Definitely worth a watch for all fans of adventure and fun.",The Mask of Zorro
46,FiendishDramaturgy,So CLOSE to being the best version...,7,18 March 2007,"I'm torn. This is my favorite version of Zorro, but I can't in all honesty say that it's the best version of Zorro.It is a bit cheesy, but it's also adventuresome, witty, entertaining, and amusing. The performances were great. I can't say awesome, but they were quite good. It was the dialog that dragged this down into the realm of almost-camp, and considering the talent and money invested in this work, I think that's criminal. Bordering on the 1960's-1970's Adam West camp in the way of dialog, this work takes you by surprise. You expect fun. You expect wit. But you had no reason, with Anthony Hopkins in a pivotal role, to expect cheese.I'm sorry to say that this rates a 6.6/10 from...the Fiend :.",The Mask of Zorro
47,elshikh4,It Means: Cinema !,8,23 November 2008,"It's hard for me to write about a movie I love. It's a situation where I just want to express all, and to be as strong as my feelings are, to right it, and to say it right. Based on the above, (Martin Campbell)'s (The Mask of Zorro) is a super entertaining movie. It was a treat to watch it in a theater back in 1998 (exactly on 17 November). Well, a lot of the American blockbusters nowadays interested more in the size and the image of the explosions more than anything, and on the top of that ""anything"" is the script. Here, among some really super qualities, the script was so fine.I told myself at the moment: ""Here's the most Indian Zorro ever!"". Because as you saw, there was melodrama all over it this time. It was brilliant not to play the same old story again, but to re-build it with lines like: who my real father is?, the relationship between the mentor and the apprentice, and double revenge stories. Using the melodrama, sanely and harmoniously, recreated the tale of the masked hero through another perspective, and kept it attractive and effective too. I loved also the dialogue with all the references about the hero, and the heroism. So the homage to the original (The Mark of Zorro - 1940), and the big party of action at the end, with a ticker bomb like James Bond movies; for me, this climactic sequence was something to remember more than any similar sequences in Bond movies themselves, including for sure the one directed by (Martin Campbell) himself 3 years earlier.We have a case of so many pleasurable elements: (Steven Spielberg)'s production and revival of (Zorro); we needed that badly. (James Horner)'s genius music score, after the historical success of (Titanic), one year earlier, we thought that (Horner) wouldn't be able to outclass that, but actually he did. It's a mark that this movie got, which would make it live longer indeed. So the glory of its prodigious theme song ""I Want To Spend My Lifetime Loving You"" which managed to be one of the 1990s best songs. And of course the direction of Mr. (Campbell). This man has so much talent and passion to the extent of being the next step ahead after the classics' makers of the 1940s and the 1950s. There's sense of brilliance, wittiness, and great love of cinema. With sharp editing and stately photography, he could picture the blaze, and strike you with it. Remember the intro; it's unforgettably cinematic to the utmost, like a swashbuckling dream, No, it was thoroughly a swashbuckling dream, and as it should be.(Anthony Hopkins) was such a treasure. Thank God for the laser operation that ended the pain in his back to accept the role. (Stuart Wilson) as (Don Rafael Montero) made it to be a real opponent for the screen eater (Hopkins), playing the villain handsomely and sedately, the best thing was that (Wilson) didn't repeat himself a la' Hollywood. (Banderas) was funny and cool, but what made me feel pity that after 10 years of it, he as if didn't do much or else!As for the downsides, (Matt Letscher) as (Captain Love) was the forever and ever stereotypical evil guy, who looks evil and behaves evil for no apparent reason! He acted with stony adolescent face, but he wasn't that horribly bad. (Catherine Zeta-Jones) was in her début looking good but less experienced and a bit naive especially with a flat role. A scene like undressing her by the sword was too far fabricated just to spice up the movie, and the trailer, in a way that I didn't like. Also, there was a poster that unites (Banderas, Zeta-Jones, and Hopkins) in one cadre at the last scene's décor, which was never in the movie. Ok, I didn't like that either, but I have to admit; it was smart, deceiving, publicity!I watched this movie at a theater, as a rented video, in our national TV, and on a movies' channel. Though, nothing can compare to seeing it at the movies; where the wide wild screen rules, the intensive sonic pace permeates, and (Horner)'s music ignites you. Some movies are meant to be watched in the movies. And (The Mask of Zorro) is one of their best. It's a ceremonial of cinema in rarely classic way.",The Mask of Zorro
48,thinker1691,""" If you could gaze into the face of death, what do you think you would see? """,9,24 January 2009,"It has been several generations since adult audiences have been able to truly enjoy the story exploits of the Spanish legend, originally called 'Joaquín Murrieta' the hero of the old West. The Spanish settlers had another name for him which was El Zorro, The Fox, when Johnston McCulley wrote for the Walt Disney studios and the late Guy Williams played the hero. Of course one could dig further into the Hollywood archives and recall such great names as Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power, Alain Delon, Duncan Regehr and even Gilbert Roland who played the capped avenger. However, in the modern era we have two extremely talented actors which definitely personify the Fox. Anthony Hopkins plays Alejandro De la Vega / Zorro and his protégé is none other than Antonio Banderas who also plays Don Diego Vega / Zorro. Julieta Rosen is Esperanza De la Vega, L.Q. Jones is Three-Fingered Jack, Matt Letscher is the villainous, Capt. Harrison Love and Catherine Zeta-Jones is the love interest of Zorro. The cast is well selected and the movie itself is jam packed with high drama, exciting adventure, great story-line involving millions in gold bullion and the theft of the state of California. The film is fast paced with dazzling sword play and explosive excitement. A great film which will no doubt become a Hollywood Classic. ****",The Mask of Zorro
49,jimbo-53-186511,"Parts of the story are a bit weak, but at least the film has a sense of humour",7,9 May 2018,"When Don Diego de la Vega/Zorro (Anthony Hopkins) loses everything trying to protect the people (including his wife and daughter) from the evil Don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson) he makes a return 20 years later in order to exact his revenge against Montero. Along the way he recruits a younger man Alejandro Murrieta/Zorro (Antonio Banderas) and trains him to avenge the death of his brother who was killed by Montero's right-hand man Captain Harrison Love (Matt Letscher)...At its heart The Mask Of Zorro is a basic revenge thriller with a very old-fashioned sensibility about it; all the swashbuckling that you see here is reminiscent of the likes of The Three Musketeers and Robin Hood. These things aren't intended as a criticism, but more of an observation and the filmmakers are clearly sticking to the tried and tested formula of 'if it ain't broke don't fix it.' In fact it's the film's old-fashioned sense of fun that is one of it's biggest strengths; it is very tongue-in-cheek, with lots of cheeky humour and some amusing visual gags. These light-hearted and playful touches do make the film palatable and ultimately very enjoyable.The main cast of the film seem to buy into this sense of fun and this is more than projected on-screen; it's very rare to see Hopkins in this kind of role and he delivers a strong and mostly fun performance (although the tragedy and misery that has been bestowed upon him by Montero allows Hopkins to also become the heart of the film). Banderas' character & performance more-or-less reflects that of Hopkins and he easily holds his own against veteran Hopkins and the two have a wonderful easy-going charm in this picture. Zeta-Jones doesn't quite have as much to work with, but she does at least buy into the sense of fun. Wilson and Letscher are both strong in supporting roles as the two villains of the piece as well.Where the film suffers slightly is in its storytelling which to be blunt is fairly uninteresting; the revenge side of the story is OK (despite being a bit generic) and it does give the film some momentum, but I never really cared much for Montero's dastardly scheme and his rather elaborate plan to overthrow his adversary - it seems that the writers gave up on this train of thought as well as this aspect of the story never really went anywhere despite its apparent importance to the story...Still the film is fun and the revenge elements of the story had just about enough heart to them to make me care and become involved in the characters and their quests for vengeance. However, some of the weaker aspects of the story do tarnish the film slightly meaning that I couldn't enjoy it quite as much as I should have been able to.",The Mask of Zorro

It walks the fine fun line that ""Indiana Jones"" does of taking the serials both seriously and satirically.The directing is pedestrian but the actors really get into what they're doing so keeps the believability high. Catherine Zeta-Jones's character is as feisty as Mulan, so maybe this is a new, positive trend.The villains didn't have to be so pure evil, on and on with their sadistic crimes, but my husband said you had to really justify the heroes killing them otherwise we wouldn't be sympathetic to such violence.Kudos to all the stunt actors who were kept mighty busy.The music is mediocre.

51,rbverhoef,A fine action hero,8,23 December 2003,"Zorro is one of my favorite heroes. He looks quite cool and not stupid, weird or childish like Batman, Superman, Spider-Man and all of their villains (except The Joker) and he has no superpowers like them, although sometimes it seems that gravity does not really apply to him. His weapon of choice guarantees some spectacular sword fighting scenes as well.With this hero all you need is a nice story and 'The Mask of Zorro' has a nice story. I will be short about it. Don Diego de la Vega (Anthony Hopkins) was Zorro but is too old now. He needs another one and Alejandro Murrieta (Antonia Banderas) is the chosen one. Their enemy is Don Rafael (Stuart Wilson). His daughter Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is actually Diego's daughter. His wife was murdered and his daughter was taken by Rafael a long time ago. Rafael also made sure the brother of Alejandro was killed by his helper Capt. Love (Matt Letscher). And now he has an evil plan that will kill a lot of people. Time for the new Zorro.It sounds a little simple and may be it is, but for a movie like this it is a perfect story. Anthony Hopkins who is never bad does not disappoint us here, Banderas has the right charm to play Zorro, Zeta-Jones is absolutely stunning and Wilson and Letscher are very good as the villains. With some nice action sequences and a pretty good soundtrack this is a very entertaining movie.",The Mask of Zorro
52,davidmvining,Swash those buckles!,8,8 June 2020,"Buckles get swashed good and hard and sexy in The Mask of Zorro, and I find its energy, sense of fun and adventure, and its action to be invigoratingly intoxicating. This is one of the most purely enjoyable action movies of the 90s, and it makes the reboot of a long dead franchise feel like a completely natural and rational choice instead of a desperate cash grab.The old Zorro, Don Diego de la Vega, finishes one last ride in the service of the people of California before the Spanish backed government pulls out completely, but his rival, Don Rafael, figures out Zorro's real identity, throws Don Diego in prison, and takes away Don Diego's daughter to raise as his own. Twenty years later, Don Rafael comes back to California, Don Diego escapes, and decides that the vehicle of his vengeance will be Alejandro Murrieta, a street urchin turned bandit with his own score to settle against one of Don Rafael's henchmen, an American cavalry officer. So sets the stage of an adventure that sees lust turn to romance, hatred turn to murder, and injustice turn to righteousness.In order to get close enough to Don Rafael and his daughter, Elena, Don Diego trains Alejandro not only to fight but also to act as a gentleman, weaving him into the upper echelons of California society quickly. The movie decides to spend a fair amount of time showing Alejandro's evolution from ruffian to fighter, but it curiously decides to completely skip his training in charm. I would be surprised if Martin Campbell didn't film a few minutes of something to add here, cutting it with the decision that the audience didn't need to actually see that particular transformation, but it's still just the slightest bit jarring when he goes from ruffian wondering why his armpit smells bad to Don Diego to well-refined gentleman in a single cut.Still, he's there and there he formally meets Elena after a previous meeting in his proto-Zorro getup where the two obviously lusted after each other. The dance that Elena and Alejandro partake in is filmed like an action scene, and it's all about how the two need to have each other, stripping away the artifice of Alejandro's disguise and Elena's position. He goes off to discover the evil plot, and this is where the movie takes an extra step too far, I think.I understand why they made Don Rafael a slave driver. Making an antagonist of him and having the audience consider death appropriate when his main goal was buying a country is a stretch. They had to give him something else, so running a slave mine to extract gold from the ground and then callously blowing them up to preserve the secret is a bit over the top. Still, the movie's not meant to be a subtle exploration of consent of the governed or anything, it's a rip-roaring swashbuckling adventure. Slave driver feels appropriate in that context.The plot drives forward as identities get revealed, plots exposed, and swords crossed, culminating in a fight at the mine where the bad falls to the good. It has the appropriate amount of pathos for this kind of movie, asking for investment but not weeping. It's mournful but not tear jerking.The action of the movie is really the highlight. Done before CGI grabbed hold of Hollywood, it's about men with swords fighting other men with swords. There's a lot of clashing steel, body flips, and real explosions. It's all filmed clearly and intelligently (no surprise given the results of Goldeneye). And, there's a sense of fun throughout it all. It feels like Alejandro is enjoying himself while the mostly harmless battles play out. This is fantasy after all, where Alejandro can meet the same set of Mexican soldiers three times, beat them all in battle each time, and they all just get away with some bruises.Then there's the sword fight between Alejandro as Zorro and Elena. That's just great.The leads are really fun and match their roles well. The story moves at a nice clip for those who insist on quick pacing. It's light-hearted and serious enough in a balanced way that never lets it get lost in either without losing sight of the other. It's modern Hollywood evoking the best of classic populist Hollywood using modern techniques (well, for the late 90s). Ultimately, it just wants to entertain, and it does that extremely well.",The Mask of Zorro

One day, an evil Villain attacks Zorro's abode under the cover of darkness, imprisons a wounded Zorro, kills his wife and kidnaps his daughter and seemingly gets away with everything for many years. One day, Zorro finds a way to break out of jail just in time to witness the evil villain's return to their shores. He spots his grown up daughter Elena in the crowd (played by the lovely Catherine Zeta Jones whom was discovered on the CBS telly series Titanic and cast in this role by Steven Spielberg) and this foils his played revenge attack.

55,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Spectacular Film of Excitement,10,8 January 2012,"Not many films start off with an interesting introduction. However, director Martin Campbell did a great job at bringing a new Zorro to take over the old aging Zorro. The way the characters act, the time that is put into making Zorro is done meticulously and it shows. It's great to see how everything in the plot starts out simple and then becomes more complex. Once the complex situations start to arise, the execution of it is beautiful.After becoming famous for being El Mariachi in Desperado (1995), Antonio Banderas is cast as the new Zorro to take over. Because Banderas is of Hispanic decent, the role of Zorro really fits him. So who's the old Zorro - none other than Anthony Hopkins. What makes Hopkins great as the older Zorro was the fact of how he became the mentor for Banderas. And although for the most part when he's lecturing, he's very serious, yet he shows that he still has a lot of energy for being elderly. Along side those two actors is Catherine Zeta-Jones, the daughter of the original Zorro. When Jones and Banderas are together, they have really great chemistry. My favorite part is when they were dancing together; it's very sexy and culturally attractive.The action sequences in this film are really something to behold. Much of it also entails a bit of comedy too. This is all helped by Banderas' charm as the new Zorro. It is because he is new and inexperienced that he makes things funny. The sword fights are really cool to see. The style that is put into using the sword in this film is truly whimsical. Much of these events take place with Banderas, Hopkins or the villains they're fighting. However, we do get a glimpse of Jones using the sword for a while too. It's nice to see some female domination in a setting like this because in the time that this took place, obviously women were not expected to take on a male's role such as that.Finally, the two other elements that make this movie great are the music and the plot. The music was composed by veteran James Horner. I really liked the way Horner captured the feel of the environment during the setting of the story. Much of the soundtrack has Hispanic instruments and it is obvious when listened to. And that is the icing on the cake. As for the story, I was pleased with how it was carried out. In the beginning of the film, the story was about a man only looking out for others but then landed in trouble. So who rescues him out of his trouble - a friend he made from years past. Not to mention his friend falls in love with the troubled man's daughter and the troubled man resolves his problems. The end result of this film is more than satisfying, and it will make viewers look inside themselves for what values they stand for.It can be interpreted as The Three Musketeers (1993) spin-off with a Hispanic twist, but for the record, this film holds its own and is really entertaining to watch. The performances are more than gratifying, the action is wondrous and the music is very lively.",The Mask of Zorro

It would become the director of GoldenEye, Martin Campbell, his last great hit. I saw it in the theater and enjoyed it with my late Nana.

61,hall895,Good fun,7,9 November 2015,"The Mask of Zorro is quite good fun. In this case good fun is enough. The film promises excitement and entertainment and it delivers on its promise. It even gives you two Zorros for the price of one. Anthony Hopkins plays Don Diego de la Vega, Zorro number one. Unfortunately for de la Vega when we meet him his time as a swashbuckling hero is about to be cut short in rather tragic fashion. He loses everything that is dear to him and is tossed into a dungeon. Twenty years later he escapes and plots his revenge. Only by this point he's a little too old for the Zorro stuff. He needs a protégé. Enter Alejandro Murrieta, played by Antonio Banderas. Alejandro, seeking revenge of his own, is raw and uncultured, nowhere near as suave as the original Zorro. And being suave is part of what makes Zorro Zorro. de la Vega will have to teach the new Zorro so much more than how to use a sword.Conveniently the man who wronged Alejandro, Captain Love, is now the right-hand man of Don Montero, the man who wronged de la Vega. They will take their vengeance together. Of course it's not quite that simple, there are complications. As you would expect in a movie of this sort one of those complications is a stunningly beautiful woman. Catherine Zeta-Jones plays Elena, the daughter Montero stole from de la Vega when she was an infant all those years ago. Elena and Alejandro fall for each other because of course they do. Meanwhile there are still those bad guys who need to be dispatched and a plot to steal California which needs to be foiled. This of course will involve sword fights. Many, many sword fights. Hey, it's a Zorro movie, what were you expecting? The movie greatly benefits from the performances of its three leads. Hopkins is reliably brilliant and clearly enjoying himself in a role which allows him to have some real fun for once. Banderas really grows into the role of Zorro as the movie progresses. He may not be very suave in the beginning but by the end he's quite the charmer. And Zeta-Jones brings a great spark to the proceedings. Elena's not your stereotypical damsel in distress, she gives as good as she gets. Zeta-Jones fits the role perfectly, full of confidence and charisma. Being drop-dead gorgeous doesn't hurt either. Banderas and Zeta-Jones have great chemistry but so too, in a very different way, do Banderas and Hopkins. Everyone plays off one another ever so well. While certainly not as memorable as the three stars the villains play their parts well too. A movie like this needs strong antagonists and here we are not disappointed, these are some truly hissable villains. Captain Love is so over-the-top in his evilness it's a little hard to believe. But the character is based on a real-life figure so give the movie the benefit of the doubt I suppose. Anyhow if you hate the bad guys, and you will, that can only help the movie in the end as you become more emotionally invested. This movie has a lot going for it. Action, drama, romance. A great story, great actors, great visuals, great music. Heroes to cheer, villains to despise. It's certainly not the most serious-minded of films but it's serious enough when it needs to be. Really good swashbuckling fun, that's what this movie is. What more could you want from Zorro?",The Mask of Zorro
62,DarthBill,Rousing swashbuckler,9,29 March 2004,"Anthony Hopkins plays an aging Zorro who finally escapes prison and sets out to avenge the murder of his wife and the kidnapping of his daughter, only to discover that his daughter has grown up to be Catherine Zeta-Jones and she has been raised by his arch enemy. Antonio Banderas plays Hopkins' student and successor.Great costumes, lavish sets and scenery, plenty of action and humor. A rousing summer swashbuckler and a more accessible vehicle for Banderas than ""Desperado"". Hopkins is good as the old Zorro and Zeta-Jones became a star over night thanks to her role as the fiery love interest.
Of course, it doesn't help that Catherine, then 28 or 29, showed some of her skin. I am of course, talking about the famous scene where Zorro cuts off her dress and leaves her standing half naked in the stable. Of course, she had been acting a little full of herself and needed to have her 5'8"" body exposed to humble her. Yeah right. Enjoy!",The Mask of Zorro
63,russem31,Loved it!,8,26 December 2005,"The Mask of Zorro is a great action-adventure film, with the director Martin Campbell, taking the popular legend of Zorro and successfully bringing it to life. What really makes this a bullseye is the fact that the script and dialogue is strong, with an appropriate amount of humor. It was also properly cast, with Antonio Banderas, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Anthony Hopkins breathing life to their fun characters. Also kudos to composer James Horner, fresh off from his spectacular Titanic score, who created one his most unique scores of his career. This is definitely a film worth seeing over and over again - a solid 8 out of 10. Too bad the sequel, The Legend of Zorro is only a pale comparison to this one.",The Mask of Zorro
64,perfectbond,Great romance and adventure,8,18 February 2004,"I remember of all the summer movies of 1998 (Armageddon, Deep Impact, Lethal Weapon IV etc.), I enjoyed this one the most. Sure a few liberties with plausibility might have been taken but the overall experience was very enjoyable. There was a sense of pioneering, honor, romance, and loyalty about the characters that made the viewing experience all the more immersive. Director Martin Campbell (Goldeneye, Vertical Limit) staged some exciting action sequences and was lucky to have a talented cast to make considerably more out of what could have been stock characters. Oh, and Banderas (in his best Hollywood role) and Zeta-Jones have great chemistry, a fact that is especially notable in their memorable dance together. All in all, very good escapist entertainment, 9/10.",The Mask of Zorro
65,Hayden-86055,Electrifying return to Hollywood swashbucklers,10,12 January 2021,"Mask of Zorro is a masterpiece, it simply is. The acting is incredible, Antonio Banderas is born to play Zorro, Anthony Hopkins is great as the ageing Zorro who takes Alejandro under his wing and Stuart Wilson does a good job as the snide and competent villain, who has just a bit of humanity left. Additionally, Catherine Zeta-Jones does a good job of portraying the Elena Montero (Hopkins' Zorro daughter who was stolen from him by Don Rafael), and lastly Matt Letscher as the sadistic Captain Love.The action and stunts are extremely well done and cinematography good, the plot's not too long and is well paced to allow both action and story development.10/10: Superb",The Mask of Zorro
66,gigan-92,"""Vigorous?"" B+",8,23 May 2012,"I'm disappointed I didn't check this one out sooner. What you get is an aggregation of not only many film genres, but many classic films. If you're a film buff, you'll spot them easily. Naturally, Zorro sports black and also takes refuge in his own little Batcave, there's a scene that pays direct homage to ""The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly"" and a lot of the action scenes are choreographed in the style of a fight scene in one of the Indiana Jones movies, mixing action with comedy, take your pick. Now here's why I differentiate between homage and rip-off. Like the Western, Batman and Indiana Jones, Zorro's tale began early on in cinema, around 70 years before this film, also in comics and such. Zorro has been the subject of SEVERAL feature films back in the day, just as good old Dr. Jones is based off 30s serial heroes. Therefore when one sees all these things blended together, it makes for nice nostalgia.Another thing that boosts the film up is a very well put together cast. Antonio Banderas and Anthony Hopkins are both as dashing as they are dramatic. Catherine Zeta-Jones is sexy but serves as more than eye-candy, well done. The villains are quite awesome, Stuart Wilson being quite debonair yet also playing one of the few great tortured villains. And Matt Letscher is just great. There's lots of great-fitting comedy as well as action that mixes contemporary stunts with classic-styled adventure.Add the score by James Horner and you got yourself a winner. Martin Campbell has certainly created an exciting ode to the classics.",The Mask of Zorro
67,Peach-2,Zorro for a new generation.,8,1 December 1998,"I just finished watching The Mask Of Zorro, and it was a spectacular achievement. It all seemed cliched at first, and even though it isn't that original, it still pays off quit well. The cast is great. Anthony Hopkins seems to get away with an English accent in every movie he does,but his acting was solid as usual. Antonio Banderas is teriffic as the new Zorro and there's funny moments between Hopkins and Banderas as teacher and student respectively. Catherine Zeta-Jones is very appealing in her role also. The only real complaint I have is that the bad guys never seem like a real threat. The direction by Martin Campbell is very good and the editing was great. A very good movie.",The Mask of Zorro

69,chrisbrown6453,Not even the beautiful Catherine Zeta-Jones could help thim movie hold my attention...,6,17 June 2002,"I went into The Mask of Zorro not thinking very much about it. I had heard about this movie for almost a year, and I wondered why it had taken so long for it to be released, if it was any good. Well I'm here to tell you, it was ok. The movie was shot very nicely, the swashbuckling, sword-fighting scenes were cool, but there was this hour long middle part of the movie, where they tried vainly to set up a story (other than revenge), that it got bogged down. Anthony Hopkins is the first Zorro. He fights for the people against the tyrants that rule California. But when he is found, and his wife is killed and his only child taken from him by one of the tyrants Don Raphael, Zorro is put into prison and not heard from again. Until 20 years later, he escapes, and befriends a young man (Antonio Banderas) who had helped him 20 years earlier. Both Zorro 1 (Hopkins) and Zorro 2 (Banderas) have revenge on their mind. Zorro 1 against the man who killed his wife and took his daughter, and Zorro 2, against the man who killed his brother. So Zorro 1 trains Zorro 2 to be the best fighter he can. Along the way Zorro 2 falls for Don Raphael's daughter, who is in fact Zorro 1's real daughter. Zorro 1 only wants to be able to tell his daughter who she really is. Zorro 2 only wants to kill the man who killed his brother. Then Zorro 2 becomes the only Zorro and everyone lives happily every after. Oh yeah, and there's this thing with Don Raphael wanting to buy California from Santa Ana using Santa Ana's own gold. He uses peasants to do his dirty work, and they're all going to die unless Zorro can save the day. I'm not sure why the revenge motive wasn't enough for the producers of the film. Adding the captives plot line seemed a little forced. That's why the movie seemed so long. The opening of the movie was non-stop action. The end of the movie, with the dueling duels was done well. But other than a few humorous sequences in the middle, for about an hour, I was a little bored. I love Antonio Banderas' acting, especially in The Specialist, and he is the perfect actor for Zorro. Anthony Hopkins always does a good job in whatever role he's in. The villain was good, the girl was good (Catherine Zeta-Jones), although if you notice, the entire movie, she's shot with very soft lighting, which is fine, but when she's standing next to someone else, and she looks soft, and he looks hard, it doesn't look good together. The story was just a little weak. They should have played up the revenge factor a lot more, and leave the captives alone. Overall, it's a decent enough film, something that looks good on a big screen, and sounds even better. But it could have been much more with the people that were involved in it.",The Mask of Zorro

71,roghache,Magnifico swashbuckling return of Zorro,9,21 March 2006,"What a fabulous movie! I cannot imagine a more romantic and thrilling return of everyone's favorite Spanish adventurer hero, Zorro. Now we have not one but TWO Zorros here, the older a compelling father seeking justice and the younger a dashing, romantic adventurer. The story begins when the original Zorro, Don Diego de la Vega, escapes from 20 years imprisonment, returning to California to exact revenge on his enemy, Don Raphael Montero, who caused his wife's death all those years ago and took his daughter to raise as Montero's own. Furthermore, Montero even now has evil plans to become wealthy at the expense of mining peasants. To further his goals, he takes on a protégé, Alejandro (an orphan who helped him as a boy) in order to train him as his successor, the new Zorro. When Alejandro meets Diego's daughter, Elena, the passions ignite...Never has the mask of Zorro been more daringly worn than by this worthy successor, Alejandro. My most memorable scene is the sword fight between Alejandro and Elena, when he literally cuts off her clothes. Oh, the outrage! the audacity! Also, the story of the older Zorro is a touching one, especially his fury at Montero for having raised Elena as his own daughter. This is naturally the ultimate insult to Diego, forced to watch his daughter's loyalty to his most bitter enemy, all the while she is of course unaware of either Diego's true identity or her 'father' Montero's villainous past deeds and current wicked intent.Though the new Zorro is wonderful in his role, the most memorable stars for me are Anthony Hopkins, who commands sympathy and respect as the aging hero, Diego, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, who is of course incredibly gorgeous as the fiery and feisty, raven haired Elena.The Z's are boldly and daringly carved out in this movie...villains to be be taken to task, past wrongs to be avenged, innocent victims to be protected, and of course a beautiful woman to woo and win. All as only Zorro can do in his legendary swashbuckling style. Oh, the derring do!",The Mask of Zorro
72,Magow-Intermean,The Mask Of Zorro Review,10,12 April 2019,"There's a mother lode of revenge to get straight - not only the sorrow of Hopkins' Zorro Senior, but Banderas' Zorro Junior is intent on catching up with evil henchman Colonel Love (Matthew Letscher) for lopping off his brother's head. This, combined with dastardly plots, daughtes to reclaim and smouldering beauties to win over drives the movie towards its climax.
Playing to the flamboyant tune of a topmark Bond movie, albeit set in a late 19th century Mexican held California, Martin Campbell's spirited rendition of the Latino Robin Hood is a splendidly straightforward adventure movie - dedicated to delivering the richest in action, humour and hot-blooded romance, while being well aware that in a comic book world of dashing heroics, silliness is a privilege not a complaint. And no manner of undiluted Welsh accents, achingly old-hat slapstick routines (come in comedy horse, your time is up) and vastly implausible swordplay can nullify the enjoyment levels of this treasurable nonsense.Impeccably cast, Banderas is one of the few gorgeous leading men willing to temper their straight-up heroic stuff with a twinkle of self-deprecation, pulling off as many laughs as gasps at his flashing blade. He is the new Zorro, tutored to duelling perfection and gentlemanliness by Hopkins' old Zorro - recently absconded from his 20-year imprisonment by his long-standing nemesis Don Rafael (Wilson). That swine also kidnapped his baby daughter to bring her up as his own. And she, naturally enough, has grown up to be ravishing beauty Elena (played with spicy vigour by a ravishing Zeta-Jones) getting all hot round the heaving bosom for this new masked hero romping around the luxurious Californian villas to bedevil the wicked plans of the sneering Rafael and his coterie of greedy Dons.There's a mother lode of revenge to get straight - not only the sorrow of Hopkins' Zorro Senior, but Banderas' Zorro Junior is intent on catching up with evil henchman Colonel Love (Matthew Letscher) for lopping off his brother's head. There's also a dastardly Rafael plot to buy California from the Mexican overlords with their own gold which needs to be scuppered - the drama crescendos to an Indiana Jones styled gold mine peopled with reams of innocent children. Plus a daughter to reclaim and a purring beauty to be won over be it by delectable tango, illicit confession or smouldering glance.Essentially, though, Zorro concerns itself with fabulous sword-fighting (and slashing big ""Zs"" in the woodwork), rip-roarious stunts (including a spectacularly OTT horse chase that errs more on the level of horseplay) and a sparkling interplay between the leads (who all seem to be having a whale of a time). Banderas and Hopkins gel nonchalantly, igniting humour and passion off the master-pupil rote; Hopkins with Zeta-Jones adds a poignant note to the boysiness of it all; but it is the Banderas/Zeta-Jones inveiglement that really sizzles - in the film's raunchiest sequence they mock-duel with flirtatious glee, stealing kisses and removing clothing with well-placed swishes of the rapier. And with the sun glistening over tumbleweed deserts and appropriately-bedecked cantinas and ranchos, director Campbell (who instilled such gusto into GoldenEye) invests it all with a fine sense of the theatrical and keen storytelling skill, sweeping events without fuss from one great set piece to the next.Inevitably, none of this has any pretensions to profundity and its upfront style adds nothing to the textbook of filmmaking technique excepting perhaps the matchless stuntwork. Campbell also has a tough time cramming all the complicated ins and outs of the plot into a sensible running time - when the grandstand, all-action finale finally arrives it seems long overdue. The Mask Of Zorro, however, is attempting nothing greater than the purest escapism that will play right across the board, tongue tickling lightly in its cheek, eyes glinting with a jovial sparkle. Its sheer good nature is infectious.The Mask Of Zorro is attempting nothing greater than the purest escapism that will play right across the board, tongue tickling lightly in its cheek, eyes glinting with a jovial sparkle.

In Mask of Zorro, the legendary Mexican hero disappears for 20 years, but when his old enemy rises again, he must train a young and arrogant protégé to take his place.The story and writing for this movie are really good. The movie is well paced, and it has just the right number of action scenes. Nothing is really overdone special effects wise.The performances are really something else.

Twenty years later, this epic swashbuckler film narrates the life journey and struggles of Diego De La Vega (Anthony Hopkins), his successor (Antonio Banderas) and his daughter (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who are fighting against the corrupt governor Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson) and defending indigenous peoples of California against tyrannical officials and other colonialist villains. I saw it for the second time last night, 21 years after I watched it in a theater in 1998, and I particularly appreciated Martin Campbell's expertise and the alchemy of a perfect casting and brilliant performances seduced me.

77,jonathanruano,The Mask of Zorro -- When Zorro stops being interesting,4,22 September 2009,"In the beginning, there was considerable hype and excitement over ""The Mask of Zorro,"" which was probably comparable to that surrounding the first Crocodile Dundee series. In retrospect, both films did not really stand the test of time. The problem with ""The Mask of Zorro"" is that it does not have much to offer. Antonio Banderas makes for a handsome Zorro, but the role seems to be too big for him. He lacks the charisma to make that role work. The villains (Stuart Wilson as Don Rafael Montero and Mark Letscher as Captain Harrison Love) lack that spark, which for example Claude Rains had in ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938) or Jack Palance had as the evil gun slinger Jack Wilson in the movie, ""Shane"" (1953), or for that matter Megan Fox had in the recently released ""Jennifer's Body."" These villains were interesting, they new how to get our attention and keep it. The villains in ""The Mask of Zorro,"" by contrast, are simply dull. The creators of this film are also not very good at doing those falling in love sequences. I realize this is a swashbuckler, but really the people who wrote the screenplay for ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938) did a much better job in creating the love sequence between Robin Hood (Flynn) and Maid Marian (De Havilland).Now this film is not a complete flop. There are some laughs in this movie. But these laughs come from the small details, like that scene where the equivalent to Sargeant Garcia says ""Kill him"" in a very strong Spanish accent. Other than that, there is little in this film to hold onto.",The Mask of Zorro

It's outlandish at times, but for me it only adds to the epic tale of Zorro!Hopkins and Banderas are dashing and charming as ever. Zeta Jones is spicy and spirited.

The choreography was crisp, the execution was flawless, and it felt as though the characters were really fighting for their lives.There was a consistent tone throughout the film, other than some of the moments of near slapstick (Nacho Libre-like) humor which mildly distracted. There were powerful moments of surprise (don't get a glass of water from Captain Love's hacienda) and high stakes. On top of it all, I am a sucker for training sequences with purpose. Anthony Hopkins did a great job of encapsulating the patient, yet strict instructor as he tried to channel the natural abilities of Alejandro.

88,pzanardo,Catherine Zeta-Jones is very beautiful...,5,5 September 2000,"Catherine Zeta-Jones is very beautiful: her presence is by far the best thing in ""The Mask of Zorro"". The movie itself could be enough good, but its many defects are disturbing. Banderas is a nice guy. Hopkins is always professional. There is a sufficient amount of fun and humor. The mildly sexy sword-duel between Banderas and Zeta-Jones is a nice and agreeable idea. The action scenes are the usual frantic video-game: I have a strong dislike for this way of filming action, though seemingly much appreciated, especially by young people. The finale, despite its pyrotechnic frenzy, is confused and predictable; moreover its setting is disagreeable. There is a number of unsuited and annoying atrocities: heads cut off and all that.The over-bad deadly enemy of Zorro has changed nationality: no more Spanish, he is now an  American officer of Cavalry, with his blue uniform, so that the audience can never forget that he comes from the States. This is quintessential political correctness: it is mandatory for the really cruel, unfair, detestable character of a movie to be a white American. All the better if he is also a handsome blond soldier.There is plenty of naiveness and flaws. The hide-out of elder Zorro - Hopkins is strongly reminiscent of the cave of Batman (we expect to see the Bat-mobile in some corner). Elder Zorro trains the new Zorro - Banderas uttering various speeches in the Oriental-martial-art-philosophy style: something like ""Karate Kid"". A bit more imagination from the authors of the screenplay would have been desirable. Zorro - Banderas is the brother of Joaquin Murieta (the legendary Mexican outlaw? In the next movie are we expecting that Zorro will be the brother of Jesse James?). The bad soldiers burst into a church, even shooting inside it, and afterwards they deport the priest as an accomplice of Zorro. This is utter nonsense: no Catholic Spanish for no reason would violate the right of asylum in those times, no matter if their commander is the super-cruel American fellow. Elena (Zeta-Jones), the noble daughter of a Spanish gentleman, breaks into a lascivious (and I bet anachronistic) dance, showing legs, underclothes and all that. This is real nonsense, much more than Zorro jumping on horse-back from 20 metre high. A world-record flaw: Elena is recognized by her old nanny, who speaks to her in Spanish, and another girl acts as interpreter! But Elena is Spanish: doesn't she understand her own language?

A dozen films and TV shows are echoed here, and none to appropriate effect...I swear all at once I was watching Pygmalion, The Princess Bride, Kung Fu, Batman, Disney's The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and Sons of the Musketeers, but never once did I feel as though it was Zorro on the screen. The traditional spirit of the story was discarded in favor of a revisionist take geared toward the all action market which at times is fun but on a whole is sorely lacking and often too hip for it's own good.  The choice of Anthony Hopkins as a dashing and extremely nimble Zorro in the beginning whose appearance is anticipated by the young Zorro-to-be and his brother as though they're anticipating the arrival of a sports hero is very far reaching and somewhat embarrassing.  The film pays more homage to Fairbanks' celebrated acrobatics skills than to the tempo which made Tyrone Power's version the Zorro for the ages in 1940. The final sword fight in that film wins out over the quicksilver and quite thrillingly choreographed battles in this version because we don't quite know all through the film if Power actually has the guile and prowess at the conclusion to run Rathbone's villain through. Such is the menace hinted at in Rathbone's mannerisms throughout and Power not being made to show his best til last  that gives that sword fight it's well deserved status as best ever on film. Here we're given five minutes to believe Hopkins transforms Banderas' illiterate swordsmanship into the deft and flawless swordfighting skills he flashes as Zorro. One is reminded of the underdeveloped spiritual transformation of Alec Baldwin from evil and destructive villain to crime fighting hero in ""The Shadow"" when Hopkins introduces Banderas to the ""circle"", then compresses his training into a few short unconvincing scenes, dumping him in our laps as fully fledged in the kind of disciplines it takes years to master. And Banderas' Murrieto exhibits no aptitude for anything other than a bumbling and heavy footed bandido early on which makes it all the more hard to grasp.The action sequences for the most part do not disappointment, and Catherine Zeta-Jones is quite stunning in all facets of her presence. Banderas is more than the right choice to play Zorro, and the general production values are quite high.  It is the combination of cardboard villains,  Anthony Hopkins' uneeded inclusion, and lack of a three act story that gives this film the tell-tale signs of a poorly handled concept translated into a huge missed opportunity on screen. And with a character as firmly entrenched as Zorro there is no room for getting it wrong!",The Mask of Zorro
90,tmpj,It'll do...bit it is NOT what it is cracked up to be.,5,23 April 2010,"This one is a bit difficult to follow. It starts out with a historical rundown that is printed in words too tiny to read. I ran it back several times and could not make heads nor tails of it. From then on, I was guessing, and it took the wind out of my sails for this film. A lot of the motives of the characters in the film are vastly understated...very poor character development overall. Maybe the producers just wanted to entertain, and said screw the story-line. But it has to make sense in a logical way, with some chronology, and there it falls short as well. I found myself longing for the old Disney version, or even Sr Fairbanks. I don't think this film topped any of the previous versions...it's just that it has been a while since any real swash-buckling has appeared on the screen. It certainly does not out-do any sword-fighting done by Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone. Perhaps that is an unfair comparison, but film-makers should use the old evergreens as a watermark before they endeavor to do films of this sort...they have to top them. This one didn't. It's entertaining..and at least there is no filthy language--or it is kept to a minimum, which is a plus and a rarity now-a-days. I do not recommend it very highly...you must pay attention or you will get lost...but it is watchable.",The Mask of Zorro
91,margulanabutrlov,The Mask of Zorro,10,23 March 2019,"There's a mother lode of revenge to get straight - not only the sorrow of Hopkins' Zorro Senior, but Banderas' Zorro Junior is intent on catching up with evil henchman Colonel Love (Matthew Letscher) for lopping off his brother's head. This, combined with dastardly plots, daughtes to reclaim and smouldering beauties to win over drives the movie towards its climax.
Playing to the flamboyant tune of a topmark Bond movie, albeit set in a late 19th century Mexican held California, Martin Campbell's spirited rendition of the Latino Robin Hood is a splendidly straightforward adventure movie - dedicated to delivering the richest in action, humour and hot-blooded romance, while being well aware that in a comic book world of dashing heroics, silliness is a privilege not a complaint. And no manner of undiluted Welsh accents, achingly old-hat slapstick routines (come in comedy horse, your time is up) and vastly implausible swordplay can nullify the enjoyment levels of this treasurable nonsense.
Impeccably cast, Banderas is one of the few gorgeous leading men willing to temper their straight-up heroic stuff with a twinkle of self-deprecation, pulling off as many laughs as gasps at his flashing blade. He is the new Zorro, tutored to duelling perfection and gentlemanliness by Hopkins' old Zorro - recently absconded from his 20-year imprisonment by his long-standing nemesis Don Rafael (Wilson). That swine also kidnapped his baby daughter to bring her up as his own. And she, naturally enough, has grown up to be ravishing beauty Elena (played with spicy vigour by a ravishing Zeta-Jones) getting all hot round the heaving bosom for this new masked hero romping around the luxurious Californian villas to bedevil the wicked plans of the sneering Rafael and his coterie of greedy Dons.
There's a mother lode of revenge to get straight - not only the sorrow of Hopkins' Zorro Senior, but Banderas' Zorro Junior is intent on catching up with evil henchman Colonel Love (Matthew Letscher) for lopping off his brother's head. There's also a dastardly Rafael plot to buy California from the Mexican overlords with their own gold which needs to be scuppered - the drama crescendos to an Indiana Jones styled gold mine peopled with reams of innocent children. Plus a daughter to reclaim and a purring beauty to be won over be it by delectable tango, illicit confession or smouldering glance.
Essentially, though, Zorro concerns itself with fabulous sword-fighting (and slashing big ""Zs"" in the woodwork), rip-roarious stunts (including a spectacularly OTT horse chase that errs more on the level of horseplay) and a sparkling interplay between the leads (who all seem to be having a whale of a time). Banderas and Hopkins gel nonchalantly, igniting humour and passion off the master-pupil rote; Hopkins with Zeta-Jones adds a poignant note to the boysiness of it all; but it is the Banderas/Zeta-Jones inveiglement that really sizzles - in the film's raunchiest sequence they mock-duel with flirtatious glee, stealing kisses and removing clothing with well-placed swishes of the rapier. And with the sun glistening over tumbleweed deserts and appropriately-bedecked cantinas and ranchos, director Campbell (who instilled such gusto into GoldenEye) invests it all with a fine sense of the theatrical and keen storytelling skill, sweeping events without fuss from one great set piece to the next.
Inevitably, of this has any pretensions to profundity and its upfront style adds nothing to the textbook of filmmaking technique excepting perhaps the matchless stuntwork. Campbell also has a tough time cramming all the complicated ins and outs of the plot into a sensible running time - when the grandstand, all-action finale finally arrives it seems long overdue. The Mask Of Zorro, however, is attempting nothing greater than the purest escapism that will play right across the board, tongue tickling lightly in its cheek, eyes glinting with a jovial sparkle. Its sheer good nature is infectious.",The Mask of Zorro

93,cableaddict,Incredibly dissapointing.,3,24 January 2004,"What a silly film, and what a waste of great talent.You don't realize it at first, but this is just a typical action film.  That is, the dialog and plot are completely non-believable, but lots of things blow up and there are plenty of fights where the good guy miraculously conquers countless foes at once.My favorite dumb scene:  Zoro defeats a room full of soldiers by lighting a conveniently-placed cannon.  The fact that no-one keeps a loaded cannon indoors, and the fact that Zoro would have no way of knowing it was loaded even if it WERE, seems of no consequence to the screenwriter.I also almost threw something at the screen when we see the new apprentice-Zoro as a complete novice with a sword, being trained by the old Zoro, yet in the NEXT scene he is suddenly an expert. It seems that only days went by, yet Zoro is now a master.   -And so it goes through the whole film.   If this were a low-budget film, all could be forgiven, but with this kind of budget and cast it's inexcuseable.I love anything Banderas is in, except for this film. Even Antonio couldn't save this turkey.It's a somewhat passable flick for a rainy day, if you absolutely have nothing else to do.  Sadly, that's about it.",The Mask of Zorro
94,Criticalstaff,The lost art of the action movie,8,22 July 2020,"The Mask of Zorro is not an old movie, but it feels like it comes from a distant cinema golden age.
The movie is fine, the actors are good, the plot is interesting, whatever... The real enjoyment I got from the movie came from the craft. The effortless-ness of it all.
It is easy to forget that this movie is a proto-superhero movie of sorts. And there is a certain pleasure to be derived from seeing the tropes and the format of the comic book film being applied here in a very honest, shall we say innocent manner.However, the quaintness of the movie is far from its only selling point. This movie is from the lost era of cinema where people actually went to theatres and budgets were ambitious. It was also at a time where digital film-making, let alone CGI, were not mainstream.
It results in an action-adventure film taking place in a Far-West setting, but with capes and sword-fight. With real horses, lots of outdoor shots, and some cool stunt work. And explosions. The film has lots of good elements but the best thing by far is the absolute thrill it takes to blow stuff up in gorgeous cinematic fashion. I am still wondering how they did for the burning villa scene at the start.The film in a nutshell is a typical action movie, yet the pacing is an important part. There is a lot of action but there is also time devoted for some good old-fashioned slapstick humour, it cuts the action in palatable chunks.
The action set-pieces themselves would not be considered great by today standards. But, I found them to be better. The movie is the proof that bigger and more epic is not necessarily better or more exciting. One of the set-pieces is a sword-fight in a meeting room around a giant table. Yet the scene is exiting because of the different ways Zorro deals with the soldiers, how he uses elements from the environment to either defeat them or escape.The golden rule for an action to work is it has to have stakes. Modern Hollywood conflates this with having a bigger loss of life, or seeing a city get destroyed, a planet, the universe etc... stakes are translated into a metric.
In Zorro the stakes are not explicitly mentioned but they are shown. The audience understands them implicitly. We want the hero to escape from the bad guys. That is enough for any action scene to work. Now put them all on horses and make them gallop in a straight line.
Another element that makes this movie great: the score. It is cool and it totally supports the movie. It gives the dramatic aspects some heft. It intervenes also in the action to give emphasis to specific moments or crucial decisions, moments of bravery and so on.
The biggest shame is not that they do not make movies like that anymore, but that it seems that nobody knows how.",The Mask of Zorro
95,Rumples,"Corny, cliched and predictable - but fun",7,28 December 1998,"This movie really is an old fashioned swash-buckler. There is no question that it is corny, cliched or predictable - it is all of these in great measure - but it is also a fun movie and well polished. Anthony Hopkins carries off his role in his characteristically classy fashion, Antonio Banderas is quite capable as Alejandro, but Catherine Zeta Jones (who, annoyingly, is referred to as 'newcomer' in publicity material, in spite of prior film experience) is stunning as Elena [although incredibly easily convinced to turn on the only father she'd known for the 20 years of her life!]. This movie is good - not worth the 7.7 or so it's currently running at but this will come down as the hype does - for a bit of fun and well made, but there is nothing new or surprising here - just old-fashioned story-telling tied to modern movie making. 7/10",The Mask of Zorro

Oh the humanity. . .then it all came crashing down due to Hollywood's formula.  The sickening standard by which the industry lives would reduce the likes of, ""Kramer vs. Kramer,"" into the absurd.  In my nightmare, I see Ms. Kramer kicking Hoffman's ass, jack slapping the judge, lecturing the attorneys, and saving the world, while New York monuments burst apart a la ""Independence Day.""

It's fast and energetic, all stunts are real and nothings covered through fast editing or anything. Also the romance is great, because both characters are strong and likable.And this movie is much darker and dramatic then most of the movies which came out recently (*cough* Rogue one *cough*), but also lighthearted enough to never feel depressing, but entertaining as hell.This is my favourite Martin Campbell movie, and these are my favourite performances by Antonio Banderas, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Anthony Hopkins to date.If you like classic movies with romance, drama, adventure and great training montages, then this is the film for you...",The Mask of Zorro
100,KingProjector93,The Legend Lives Again!,8,9 April 2015,"Based on one of the grandaddies of modern superheroes, this 90s take on the crime fighting swashbuckler starts during Don Diego De La Vega's final days as Zorro, when his world is turned upside down, his wife killed, daughter stolen and he himself locked away by the corrupt governor of California. A few decades later, Diego escapes and eventually enlists vengeful bandit Alejandro to take up the mantle of Zorro and bring down the governor once and for all before he can carry out a murderous land scheme.Surprisingly well thought out, this Spielberg-produced 'Zorro' is a a fun ride that also discusses the inspirational power of symbols, masks to be precise, and their transcendent powers. The compelling father-son relationship between Diego and Alejandro is the heart of the film, as each man learns something from the other and lives up to the heroic mantle of Zorro in their own way. One learns to be better than vengeance, the other to be a hero for the people, an icon of good. Despite these hefty themes, the film still regularly has a sense of humour to prevent excess dourness, mainly in seeing the boorish Alejandro become a cultured gentleman, as well as his stubborn horse Tornado.The cast embrace the old fashioned nature of the material. Antonio Banderas knocks it out as a thief-turned-smiling charmer, while Anthony Hopkins & Catherine Zeta Jones wonderfully run with their respective roles of wise mentor and spunky lover, as does Stuart Wilson and Matt Letscher as the governor and sadistic captain. Naturally, also having some great set pieces, like the mine duels, and a passionate, Hispanic-infused score by James Horner, help out further.In terms of criticisms, Campbell's Mexican adventure fills out any adventure lover's bill nicely, and so complaints about the lack of anything drastic, original or confrontational would be to miss the point of the material. The only major complaint is perhaps Letscher is a one note, boo-hiss sadist lackey compared to his more layered, even slightly sympathetic superior, but again, that's just part of this sort of material. Honestly, it's the best kind of film that 'does what it says on the tin'.",The Mask of Zorro

Anthony Hopkins is excellent as usual and the ""love scene"" between Zorro (Banderas) and Elena (Zeta-Jones) is an instant classic!This movie is done as a typical super hero type of movie, sort of like Robin Hood and Batman.  But it is done in more much of a realistic way, with the viewer being able to relate to most of the characters in the story.  I highly recommend this to just about everyone out there.

The action is slick and timed perfectly but as director Martin Campbell is best known for his work on the Bond Film GOLDENEYE, that is really no surprise.The stunt work is excellent and very much in the classic Fairbanks-Flynn mould, particularly the horse-chase sequence which is straight out of pre-war Hollywood. Sets look good and the final explosive gold mine scenes are a match for TERMINATOR 2s apartment block-demolishing sequence.

The script is clever and interesting, the humour is spot on (didn't even exist in Batman Begins), you can suspend disbelief to the action and really enjoy it (unlike most films these days with thousands of half-second edits and a melee of mess), there's a proper villain (actually two), and the story makes bloody sense.The characters are all well developed and the pacing is perfect. You see, here's the thing, dumb masses: We need characters we can understand and care about in order to care about the film.

The acting is great all around each actor/actress giving an energetic performance. The choreography of the fight scenes was amazing, and all the action scenes were amazing and featured awesome stunts. The only bad thing I can think of is that the plot was a bit weak, but hey, it's Zorro, what it's all about is the action, and this movie sure excels there. The other main thing I loved about this movie was the soundtrack, James Horner does a fantastic job, creating one of the most complex and memorable film scores I've ever heard.

It was the script that got me, or maybe the too-much music which wasn't even original.  I'm really sick of this trend in movies where the director seems to think I'm too stupid to know what to feel for every shot, and so points out what I should feel with heavy-handed music. I love a good swashbuckler.  This is not one.  I knew who everybody was, who they would become, and what would happen, in five minutes.  No breath of a plot twist was promised.  And right before I passed out, I was being hammered into sleep by the acting.  (Remember Jon Lovitz on Saturday Night Live?  You know -- ""AC-ting!"" Yeah, well, this is the kind of thing that gave him that idea...) People who were watching with me and did not fall asleep said my expectations were too high, that this was just another offering of delicious cheese in a cheesy genre.  Okay, but it really wasn't delicious at all. Bland.  Very very bland.  I'd prefer a lower budget and more real (as opposed to musically generated) drama and suspense.

I don't watch a lot of comedies.  The Mask of Zorro was a fine combination of all of them. The two Zorros play well off each other and for once we get a female protagonist, Elena (Zeta-Jones) who doesn't need rescuing. She can take care of herself.  The plot is straight-forward.  Great popcorn flick and it ranks up there with The Adventures of Robin Hood starring Errol Flynn.  Not one of the best films of all time but one of the most fun.4/4 stars, 10 on the IMDB scale and an A on my own scale.Toodles, A.J.",The Mask of Zorro

It was a crisp action movie with a good story, and adequate acting. I read some of the actor considerations that were thought of for Alejandro and Elena, and I'm glad the studio and director went with Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones. They did a great job.
I also read that Robert Rodriguez wanted a more violet, R-rated film, which I'm glad they did not do.

The plot has been discussed enough but over two hundred viewers so no plot summery.If first saw this as freshman high schooler and went specifically to see Antonio Bandaras. A perfect Zorro. He played the new Zorro well and I liked his whole training regime scenes that old Zorro, the excellent Anthony Hopkins, forces him to undergo.A then unknown beautiful Catherine Zeta Jones plays love interest Elena, and is no damsel in distress.I have always liked those whole revenge, good guy wins, great adventure movies, they are just not any good ones that have been made in a very looooong time! I liked Zorro it is a great story, with lavish sets and costumes. The actors are all excellent in there roles and really portray that ideal hero element from old movies.",The Mask of Zorro
127,gothamite27,Impressive and enjoyable interpretation of a timeless legend,8,3 July 2005,"'The Mask Of Zorro' is a fine example of what Summer Blockbusters should be...but generally aren't. Of course, 'The Mask of Zorro' is based on a timeless character that existed long before the likes of 'Mr and Mrs. Smith' or 'Spider-Man'. Zorro has been the subject of over 40 different films, perfect at best, hideous at worst.Rather than simply creating a new franchise, with a story showing how Don Diego de la Vega became the original Zorro, this film focuses on the fact that Zorro, unlike other heroes, is a legend, and can live through generations.Anthony Hopkins plays an aging de la Vega, who is caught out by his enemies and is subjected to twenty years imprisonment before escaping. Upon his escape, he finds that his gaoler, Don Rafael Montero, has returned to California, with evil plans no less. De la Vega finds troubled bandit Alejandro Murrieta (played with comic charm by Antonio Banderas) seeking to avenge his brother's death and Murrieta's training to become the new Zorro begins.Unlike Zorros of the past, this film had a far more lenient budget, giving way for wire effects and stunt men, so that the film could stretch to its fullest. However, at the beginning of the film, when we see Hopkins in his final days as Zorro, it is slightly laughable, as the camera films a slightly pudgy old man before the shot changes and he transforms into an athletic youth (clearly a stuntman), leaping around the scenery and jousting at his foes. Hopkins' acting skill definitely paid off in the role of De la Vega, however he did not have the physical presence of Zorro in his old age. Then again, finding an athletic sixty-year old who can pass for a thirty-year old and still act to his fullest is probably easier said then done.This film is visually and audibly breathtaking, also, with James Horner's impressive Hespanic themes and beautiful landscapes. One particular scene which compliments both musical and production design is an impressive, however slightly erotic, tango scene between Banderas and Catherine Zeta Jones' love interest.Overall, this is a highly enjoyable family film that will appeal to all who love adventure.",The Mask of Zorro
128,Benjy,Thoroughly enjoyable romp,7,30 July 1999,"The Mask of Zorro may never win any Oscars and I'll never pretend that perhaps it deserved to but it is a wonderfully engaging and entertaining film. Some doubts may be cast about employing 2 welsh actors (Hopkins and Zeta-Jones) to fill the roles of Mexicans but the odd wavering accent, they carry it off with an air of believability. What is such a joy to behold in this film is the chemistry between the 3 leads. Catherine Zeta-Jones would seem to be heading for a huge career. She has the looks and screen presence of a 1950s star. Both her and Anthony Hopkins gel well with Banderas who is in his element here. The scenery is breathtakingly beautiful and the fight scenes wonderfully choreographed. Yes it's corny and predictable but it's grade A entertainment none the less. 7/10.",The Mask of Zorro
129,bayhorse,A Superbly-Inspiring Work of Art!,10,16 December 2006,"Speaking of cinematic masterpieces, the Final Anti-Type, the Seventh and Last Head, on the Image of the Beast (Daniel 7:7), really should preview carefully one of the very best, as well as, now, and, therefore, all-the-more-amazingly, one of the latest; in which some of the finest examples of his dreaded ""Oligarchical Principle,"" Noblemen who, to quote a line from the film, ""say one thing and think another,"" are very vividly displayed. In fact, Zorro is a very personal Trademark to me, as a connoisseur who couldn't be more delighted with the latest enhancement upon an already immortalized classic. Whereas most ultra-modern cinema tends merely to substitute for the lack of any formal resonance, with technological enhancements designed to stimulate the most sensationalistically depraved senses alone, The Mask of Zorro is a genuine work of art; to begin with, in the strictest aesthetic sense per se, as well as in the form of one of the most thoughtfully inspiring and carefully well plotted Morality Plays I've ever encountered, right up there with the inherently insurpassable Robin Hood of Errol Flynn! All the right elements of action, romance, chivalry, and honor serve to bring out the deepest subtleties of the human spirit, with a refinement which can only be appreciated to the unfortunately rare extent it deserves by those who find it nothing short of the most personally and permanently transfiguring experience, rather than as the mere entertainment it no less abundantly is. . . . Even the casting, as well as the script, and the finely blended musical score, could not have been more to perfection! Anthony Hopkins was in the finest form I have ever seen for him, as Don Diego de la Vega, with his magnificently aristocratic charm, and genuine nobility of stature. And, of course, Antonio Banderas holds his own with an artistic mastery every bit as impressive as the swordsmanship it nevertheless so much less plausibly embodies, particularly on such buffoonably short notice, along with just about all the skills of a Valentino, a Bruce Lee, and even a Tarzan combined; although I wish that little trick with the candles, which had Basil Rathbone laughing out the other side of his face as well, in 1940, had likewise somehow found its way into this particular script, in some imaginatively analogous form. . . . Even while exaggerated to the point of the most deliberately fanciful ludicrousness, I only wish I could say in everything but the strictest ethical sense as well, one embodying a fight for the most genuinely independent kind of California; such antics are, in the process, really only intended to lend greater buoyancy to the spirit and imagination of a Vision for which almost nobody is even soberly religious enough to search. The truth is that the herd loves and insists upon nothing more than to be kept fattened, contented, dumbed down, and led by the nose, particularly with the most beautifully self-flattering delusions! Indeed, about two-hundred years of modern democracy have done more than the past few thousand to completely confirm perhaps even its grossest incapacity for anything else, as well as its strongest instinct to murder anybody who dares tell it as much!--Speaking even of most Working Class Heroes who think they have any more use for John Lennon than he did for them! What most of them really need, to replace the unwarrantedly inflated view they currently have of themselves, is enough of the right kind of guidance and discipline, for a totally unprecedented change! . . . Catherine Zeta-Jones could not have been more charmingly tailored to her role, with the same added sword-in-hand through which Stuart Wilson likewise compounds so dynamically upon the original 1940 script. In fact, I never realized just what a superb character actor Mr. Wilson actually is, until given a chance to compare this performance, of Don Rafael Montero, with his part, for instance, as the equally though much less demandingly evil ""ex"" cop, Jack Travis, in Lethal Weapon III. As Captain James T. Kirk, from the Star Ship Enterprise, would have put it, he's definitely earned his pay for the week, along with other compensations just about as harrowingly reminiscent of the great Kodos; that is, next to an equally fine performance, of Captain Harrison Love, played by Matthew Letscher, whose own chivalrously ignoble sense of ""honor"" had also come to its most Divinely-Predestined End (Psalms 57:6), as seen through the eyes of its very own worst enemy. . . . And it's certainly no surprise to see the name of Steven Spielberg among the list of credits, for the same reason it would have been quite a surprise to me had just about anybody else been able to pull off this particular little stunt. To quote still another line from the film, which might as well have come directly from, again, the Final Anti-Type, the Seventh and Last Head, on the Image of the Beast, ""The children should never have to see the things we do,"" after-all; and yet, to the contrary, he, as with any real ""traitor to his own class,"" should be among the first to insist that the children not be spared even the most tastefully as well as meaningfully well-proportioned violence in this one! But, to be perfectly honest, I have very little hope here, for essentially the same reasonHe'll Never Be Rid of Me!",The Mask of Zorro
130,Erik G.,Ever heard of overkill?,5,12 March 1999,"More is not always better!  This is a fabulously fun, exciting, hilarious movie, but it just goes on forever.  There are just too many swordfights, daring rescues, and nonstop action, at the end, it's just overkill.  I mean, I like action, swordfights, and high speed action, but this movie (especially at the end) had me saying 'OK, OK, now let's kill the bad guys and get this over with!'.  I never thought I would say that a movie had too many swordfights in it, honestly.  But just count how many times someone has their sword pointed at someone else's neck, so that they can deliver some Dramatic Dialogue, only to have that person escape to continue the fighting on and on and on...  You would lose count.  Heck, the hero even swordfights the heroine!  I mean, it's excessive!But despite all that, Mask of Zorro is still lots of fun.  Some better editing would have been nice, but other than that, it's very good.  Just don't be surprised if after you see it, you find yourself thinking 'well it's about time!'",The Mask of Zorro
131,kheops,"Enjoying, honest. In the hollywoodian tradition",8,25 January 1999,"This movie is the most honest Hollywood sent us since many time. There is a good screenplay who doesn't take us as fools and does not want to make us think that the new Zorro is better than the older, we see that Zorro is a human being, not a superhero like superman or Bruce Willis. The actors are simply great, Anthony Hopkins remembers Guy Williams, the actor of the serial when we were little children, Antonio Banderas is playing Zorro, we see that in his eye, under his mask, and Catherine Zeta-Jones is more than beautiful, she's perfect. That's simply enjoying, in the old hollywoodian tradition, when ther were still more than 3 good directors, when special effects were not a pretext to make movies. Martin Campbell is a good director and we can be amazed that he does not direct movies like that more often. Hollywood is still able to enjoy us.",The Mask of Zorro

133,MiB-6,"no special effects, no mega superstars, but still one of the best action films of this decade",8,25 September 1998,"""The Mask of Zorro"" is a delightful feast for the eyes. Romantic, funny and action-packed, this well-made adventure film captivated me and reminded me of the old Indiana Jones days. With a legendary hero you can always count on, this is perfect summer fare. The acting is extremely good for a movie like this, with Anthony Hopkins doing his best in his first action film and succeeding, Catherine Zeta Jones perfectly cast and glowing on the screen with charisma, and Antonio Banderas in his superstar-making role is probably the best Zorro on television or film. The villains are a let-down, but having an a-list like Alan Rickman or Jeremy Irons in the main villain role would somehow cause a spotlight-contest, and the villain might steal all the scenes, which is very risky in this type of movie. There are practically no flaws in the technical department, and Martin Campbell (GoldenEye) was well chosen over action-master Robert Rodriguez who might have spoiled the action sequences with his tendencies toward bloody, violent action (Desperado, From Dusk Till Dawn). The best part of this movie was there was no blood at all during the fights, and only a few people died- most were either punched by Zorro, wounded by his sword or just pushed off a horse.This blockbuster is for all ages and all kinds of people. If you're a fan of charming heroes like Indiana Jones or the old Zorro, you would treasure this flic. Overall, one of the most enjoyable films I have ever seen and probably in the top 5 of the best action films of this decade.",The Mask of Zorro

Banderas is appealing as the roguish Zorro and Jones is captivating as the heroine, Elena.  Anthony Hopkins rounds out this fine cast.  The movie is a modernization of the classic story of Zorro and the update is enjoyable.  A lot of chemistry flowed between Banderas and Jones and, although a PG-13 movie, the sword fighting scene is sensual and playful.  This is a wonderful movie and features a beautiful duet between latin sensation Marc Anthony and Tina Arena.  One of the few movies that continue to give to the audience when the credits start to roll.",The Mask of Zorro
135,Primate84,Simply great!!!,9,17 February 2001,"WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS!
Once in a while, you see a movie that you cannot help loving. For me, that movie has got to be ""The Mask of Zorro"". It has loads of action, and great performances by all five of the main actors. First, the three heroes: Anthony Hopkins delivers a truly excellent and moving performance, as usual. Just about anyone watching the movie can't help sympathizing with his character. Antonio Banderas is also quite good, and Catherine Zeta-Jones gets her acting career off to a great start with her portrayal of Elena. She and Antonio have very good chemistry together, which is particularly shown in the scene when they dance, and during their breathtaking swordfight. Now, for the two villains: The closest thing to a problem I have with this movie is that even though Stuart Wilson plays Don Montero quite well, there are a few scenes where he appears to be kind of soft for the main antagonist. His character in ""Lethal Weapon 3"" was a ruthless, heartless villain. If Stuart Wilson had made Montero more like that, this movie would be perfect. However, this small problem with one of the two villains is more than made up for with the other villain, Matt Letscher, as Captain Love, the sadistic, clearly insane cavalry officer with whom Antonio's character has a serious axe to grind. Letscher delivers every aspect of his character with as much casual cruelty as possible, and succeeds perfectly. I still get shivers down my spine when I hear the chilling yell that he utters as he jumps at Alejanduro in the film's climax, right before he meets his well-deserved end. Most of this movie is fun for the whole family, but the scene in which Captain Love speaks to Alejanduro in private at the hacienda is a gruesome exception to this. This scene was, I believe, mainly intended to show how completely bonkers the Captain really is, but it would be a good idea to take the younger children out of the room during this scene. Still, the movie has a moral to it: Never take your loved ones for granted, because you never know how much longer they'll be with you. ""The Mask of Zorro"" is a wonderful movie for just about anyone, and I recommend it to all of you who enjoy action, drama, or just like watching great movies.",The Mask of Zorro
136,jn_agin,Robert Rodriguez should have directed this,6,16 August 2020,"A Zorro movie, on paper, actually sounds like a good idea. If you brought a good cast, get together a good production time, and had a excellent script, I could see a very interesting and entertaining film. Sadly, this 1998 action film falls savagely short. Directed by Martin Campbell, this would have been a Steven Spielberg-produced film(though he ultimately dropped out). Even more interesting is that Robert Rodriguez was originally set to direct this film. Had he stayed on, this would likely have been a better movie. Unfortunately, he left due to budget issues, and all we have left is this bore. This is your standard ""older hero teaches newer hero"" film (except with the old Zorro and the new Zorro), complete with action sequences, a squandered romance sub-plot, and a plot line involving an attempt to buy what became California from Santa Anna. While most of the actors are good, Anthony Hopkins feels out of the place as Older Zorro, who IS supposed to be Spanish. My biggest beef with the film is that the film feels like a worse Indiana Jones; the at times overtly cartoonish action scenes( though most of them are good), mostly unfunny humor, and the aforementioned romance plot. I can see a good film is this idea; it just seems as if it wasn't fully realized. Overall, 6.5/10",The Mask of Zorro

And has a rich story of redemption that makes one truly remarkable film.. It's shot well done, and casted very well. Anthony Hopkins (Dela Vega) is a superb cast addition in which he brings to life a aging hero who seeks justice for his past mistakes while trying to start a new one, by renewing his relationship with a daughter he hardly got to know! (Elena) played by Catherine Zeta-Jones does a remarkable and beautiful part as a curious and gorgeous women who falls in love with (Elliondo) played by Antonio Banderas as the one and only ""Zorro!"". Banderas roll is questioned sometimes but, doesn't stray to far off and brings to life a almost forgotten hero in cinema culture.. The Mask of Zorro is a brilliant film with great actors and characters alike.

In the 70s there was STAR WARS, in the 80s we had THE GOONIES, and, for the 90s, we are brought THE MASK OF ZORRO. This film does something that not many contemporary films do. It entertains.This movie is an action-packed, comedic, romantic, swashbuckling adventure, much in the tradition of THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD. I was truly surprised that a ""movie of the summer"" could deliver such cinematic masterfulness. It is a rare action/adventure film that has great direction, writing, and acting.No one could ask for a better Zorro than Antonio Banderas. He brings such a heroic presence to Zorro. I would compare him to Errol Flynn. Anthony Hopkins, not surprisingly, delivers a wonderful performance and Catherine Zeta-Jones is perfect in her role as Elena. No one could have pulled it off better. Who would've thought two Welsh actors would make such wonderful Mexican heroes?I am so pleased that Martin Campbell was the director to bring this film to life. He has a wonderful ability to bring classic heroes into the nineties without making them TOO nineties. First, he brought a wonderful James Bond and then a superb Zorro. I'm just waiting for him to bring us a Spiderman movie (we can hope can't we?).Overall, this a wonderful film for all to enjoy! One of the best movies of the year (second only to PLEASANTVILLE)! A+!

Antonio Banderas (was made for this part), Anthony Hopkins, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, work really well together. The on screen chemistry is remarkable. There is romance, swordplay, and a good story in this movie. I would say that this is better than the Douglas Fairbanks original. I found that i really cared about the characters.One other point - the trend in a lot of films to take every opportunity to get the leading lady's clothes off (or any of the other women for that matter) and dive straight into a sex scene, is NOT what this film does.

It was everything I could've hoped for.From the whole ensemble to the reason behind it, this film kind of reminded me of an old-fashioned, low-budget, Mexican Batman. Well, think about it. A justice-seeking vigilante who wears a black mask with a black suit and a black steed goes about taking care of villains trying to do in innocent people. Okay, well, maybe not...And, for those who speak Spanish, did you notice the irony between ""Montero"" and ""Zorro""? If you don't speak Spanish, look up those two words in a Spanish-English dictionary. You'll get it, eventually.Okay, well enough of that. Here's the review...First thoughts: One to buy! Can't wait till the sequel!Pro's: Too many, just watch it! By far, Banderas' best performance. Zeta-Jones does a convincing performance at being Spanish. Action-packed with some humor to it, too.Con's: Not too many. Not the best film I've ever seen, but an excellent one, nonetheless. Some long fight sequences, but otherwise, nothing.Overall: Just see it! You'll love it!Capt. Love: ""It's just one man..."" Don Rafael Montero: ""It isn't just one man, d*** it!

Antonio Banderas comes across as a buffoon. Why is it that most big production films these days have to have the lead actors making quips every 5 minutes? How about a strong story for a change? The film might have had a chance if Robert Rodriguez (Desperado) not dropped out as director early on. He would have brought an edge to the film that Martin Campbell, who is just one of the many Spielberg clones working for Spielberg's production company Amblin Entertainment, was not able to do.Anthony Hopkins brought each scene he was in to a higher level. He is a fine actor that gives a presence to every character he plays - even those that are poorly written.If you want to see an interesting Antonio Banderas film, check out Pedro Almodóvar's ""Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down"". For a good, recent Anthony Hopkins film, check out ""Surviving Picasso"".Save your $8 and wait for Zorro the ""Theme Park Show"" - where you can see the sword fights performed by the real stars of this film - the stunt men and women.The film is rated PG-13 for cartoon violence.",The Mask of Zorro

148,Maximilliann,Symbiosis of classic heroes,9,16 February 2015,"Excellent adventure film that it takes the character created for a serial early twentieth century by Johnston McCulley, which was already interpreted correctly on the screen by Douglas Fairbanks in the silent version of Fred Niblo 1920, and its sound remake, by Tyrone Power, in the version directed by Rouben Mamoullian in 1940. The character, who also knew a fleeting glory in the films of European series B in the mid-60s, is a cross between the tradition of generous bandit, in the style of the legends of ""Robin Hood,"" and the anonymous liberator and double personality, represented by ""the Scarlet Pimpernel"" by Baroness d'Orczy. The clever script for this film, takes the character to interpret Fairbanks and Power, played this time with his usual solvency by Anthony Hopkins, in his latest adventure, and making a transcript of the plot of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"", he's imprisoned for nearly 20 years, but he takes his revenge, after a miraculous liberation. That's possible be taking the personality of the masked sword-man by a new character, Alejandro Murrieta, played by Antonio Banderas, in his most memorable role to date of his Hollywood films, resulting in a whole process of initiation, which is one of the strengths in the plot rests. If the tandem of Hopkins-Banderas is one of those strengths, the second is the tandem of Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta Jones, whose chemistry on screen becomes all the memorable scenes in which they appear together, especially the duel sword in the stables. Martin Campbell up with this attractive material an excellent adventure film of classic resonances to achieve the precise rhythm between fast action scenes and hilarious comedy without the spoof, which has so burdened adventure films of recent years.",The Mask of Zorro
149,CineMan-8,Nobody disappointed,7,3 December 1998,"The Mask of Zorro is a typical Hollywood movie but at its best times. Nobody could get out disappointed by such picture. Of course nobody gets out enthrilled. It's a classic adventure movie with many comic elements and of course the essential love story. Banderas is good in the title role and quite convincing. Zeta Jones is a true beauty and is ideal for the role. But the man who steals the show is certainly Anthony Hopkins. A great actor as he is he ""steals' every scene he is in. The direction is also impressing and the cinematography superb. I'm not saying that 'The Mask of Zorro"" is an unforgettable picture or that it is one of the best movies of the year. It's a movie that entertains you and makes you feel satisfied. It's the kind of classic movie that Hollywood used to make many years ago and unfortunately doesn't make often anymore.",The Mask of Zorro

Anthony Hopkins is at this very best in the film: he is very convincing as Zorro (although I think the make-up was overdone at the beginning of the film) and the film has a refreshingly inventive script.  Antonio Bandaras is even better than in Evita, and I thought the dialogue exchanges between Hopkins and he were quite first rate.  I have only given two films 10/10 on the voting section. The other was North by Northwest...",The Mask of Zorro
154,witch king,A dashing boots and swords extravaganza!,9,23 November 1998,"This latest essay in the Zorro literature is very nearly a masterpiece; the only fault I have with it is that it's too short. Since Johnston McCulley's novels of Old California, in which the mysterious Don Diego de la Vega figures as the heroic nobleman who frees the ""serfs"" from their bonds, the American public has been treated to some spotty efforts vis-a-vis this character. The mythical progenitor of the Lone Ranger [remember, all of you, Don Diego wore the mask before the ""younger Reid""], the character has been interpreted in either of two ways--as a straightforward lead role or as a childish caricature [the Disney outrages come to mind]! Here, Anthony Hopkins realizes that it's time to drop the curtain on his adventures as he has responsibilities to wife, daughter, house, and class. The greedy caretakers of Spain's ""property,"" however, see to it that Don Diego's uncomfortable muckraking style is rid forever. The movie's greatest appeal, I think, is the slow and painful transformation of Alejandro Murrieta from a common street thief to a noble and majestic figure with a constituency of far more than one. Antonio Banderas is perfectly cast as the newer incarnation of the avenger of the people's wrongs. He moves from an unkempt, unclean drunkard to self-pitying defeatist to reluctant student, to chest-beating show-off, to reflective and cunning poseur, to gallant and lover, and then, in full flower, to shining exemplar of retributive justice. There is no caricature here, in either Hopkins or Banderas' interpretation of the difficult role. Their scenes together are comedic, worthy, and instructive. Their relationship is very nearly a metaphor for the loving care that any father would lavish on a son [and is the complete opposite of what Spain lavished on its 300-years old colony]. The remainder of the principal cast should come in for praise as well. Stuart Wilson was masterful as the unworthy, thieving Don Rafael Montero, the robber governor. His American henchman, the thuggish Harrison Love, was wonderfully read by Matthew Letscher. Finally, Zorro the Younger's love interest, Catherine Zeta-Jones, brought exquisite feminine beauty and sensitivity to what could have been a thankless role. Her verbal sparring [as well as her swordsmanship] did her proud, and, no doubt, enhanced Zorro's admiration and respect for her, as she did ours. It is a thousand pities that this film was as under-appreciated as it appears to have been.",The Mask of Zorro

157,francisco533,A great old-style adventure swashbuckler. 10/10,10,16 September 2008,"""The Mask of Zorro"" is a great old-style adventure swashbuckler.
 This new version takes the hero from his aristocratic origin and it doesn't only returns him to the masses but also links him to an historical figure: Joaquin Murrieta.
Alejandro Murrieta (Antonio Banderas) is a poor degenerate, a reflection of the time in wich he lives. Zorro is gone, injustice reigns and the land is under corruption. So, the original Zorro, Don Diego de la Vega (Anthony Hopkins) chooses him to take up the mantle and become champion of the people. There's a clear influence of Alexandre Dumas in the script that ends up being a plus for the story. The film lives up to the expectations and besides the new cool Zorro and the scheming old fashioned villains, it still presents us the most romantic and intrepid fencing amateur, Elena (Chaterine Zeta-Jones). She proves to be a daring challenge for the new hero but she couldn't resist his charms.High adventure, paso doble, romance, swords! Adventure lives once again and this movie does it as none as ever done.",The Mask of Zorro

I thought it is the perfect movie: there is action, romance, and Antonio Banderas gives this terrific movie a sexy edge. W ell where do I start. I must admit if it hadn't been Antonio Banderas as the new Zorro I doubt I would have liked it. It amazed me and I have probably seen this movie over ten times. Anthony Hopkins was good but his role wasn't the optimum choice of roles. If you are an Antonio Banderas fan you will love it. If you aren't well I think you will fall in love with him. I probably sound like I'm obsessed with Antonio Banderas and I am but he plays the role perfectly and he is not just wonderfully handsome but an amazing actor.",The Mask of Zorro

I don't like some of the older Western movies, or western movies in general, but I have never seen a more well written, beautifully acted movie besides Terminator, the Godfather, Star Wars, ET, and Back to the Future. This is my favorite Anthony Hopkins role besides Hannibal. He was perfect for the role of old Zorro. I highly recommend this movie. It's a great movie. It's exciting, clever, it has characters you care about, its a great movie. But this is a type of movie where either you love it within the first 30 minutes, or you hate it instantly.

And Romance in movies was surprising and wonderful? And you needed to have chemistry between the two leads? I remember that. Mask of Zorro has none of these.There isn't one redeeming quality about this film. It's boring and dull. If you think a good action scene, is a man jumping back and fourth on horses while people chase him, you need to wake up and smell the 90's.The actors don't even try and give it their best! You look in their eyes, and all you see is what they are planning on buying with their HUGE pay checks!I really hated this film to start to finish. Hate is too nice of a word for how I feel on this film. Let me whip out my thesaurus here, so you can understand how I feel about this crap.I DESPISE this film! Rating 1 out of 10. Let's hope SIR Anthony Hopkins and his co-star Antonio Bandereas can pick a decent...how do you say? Oh yes, movie. Let's hope they can pick a better movie to do next time.

I have just watched this movie for the very first time and I must say this movie is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen in my forty years of movie watching life. Almost everything that went into the making of this movie was perfect. Acting was perfect. Anthony Hopkins as the senior Zorro was brilliant. Antonio Bonderas was a complete package and Catherine Zeta Jones was equally fitting and ridiculously attractive. I was most impressed with the visual and attention to details. Overall this is a great movie and enjoyable for all.,The Mask of Zorro

164,Mulder-17,Good Flick,8,14 October 1998,"The Mask of Zorro is quite a good flick.  It has a good amount of action and adventure, with a helping of romance and humor on the side.  Sir Anthony Hopkins was great as the Elder Zorro, the scenes with him and his whip were neat, and I understand he whipped the candles himself.  Antonio Banderas as a young bandit, trained to be Zorro by Zorro Snr. did a great job.  He makes a perfect Zorro. Overall an ********(8) stars out of 10",The Mask of Zorro

Much like 'GoldenEye', this is a film where everything works to perfection: the cast, the cinematography, the editing, the stunts and the soundtrack. The story won't bore you for a single second and you can really feel this as a continuation of Walt Disney's popular 1957 series starring Guy Williams. The master-protégé dynamics between Hopkins and Banderas are top-notch, so is the chemistry between Banderas and Zeta Jones. Stuart Wilson and Matt Letscher make brilliant villains - I wonder why none of the Bond films hired any of them to play masterminds, since I could have easily see them confronting Pierce Brosnan or Daniel Craig's version of 007.And the main title song deserves another paragraph. ""I Want To Spend My Lifetime Loving You"" is one of the best romantic songs ever written! Really touching and powerful, you can feel its energy during the end credits and over the instrumental versions the late James Horner interpolated in the score, frequently with the Zorro theme which we remember from the TV series. Just perfect. Nothing more to say.",The Mask of Zorro

Whether you want it there or not.  I was never a big fan of A. Banderas but after this movie I forgave him such movies as Desperado.  Catherine Zeta-Jones was beautiful beyond words.  And it was so refreshing and wonderful to see a woman in her position from her time wielding a sword with such grace and efficiency.  The sword play between her and A. Banderas and their wonderful dance are definitely my favorite parts of this movie.  I liked how they made A. Banderas the ""new"" Zorro.  It was like the film makers were acknowledging that this was a new Zorro for a new era and were not trying in anyway to change or improve the older (most popularly Disney) Zorro.  A. Hopkins was a treat as he always is.  This was just such a fun movie that you can't help enjoy it and laugh at it's deft comedy.",The Mask of Zorro

To me, it was practically perfect in it's portrayal of the ""he done me wrong"" malady--not just once, but twice! The story, the action, the sets, the actors, the horse: all were reminiscent of the restraints of the early TV show, yet magically updated and captured the essence, the beauty, the charm and the swash and buckle. I loved this movie!! They kept the violence from being overly gratuitous, virtually no profanity and the sex well within the bounds of decency--(**POSSIBLE SPOILERS FOLLOW**) well, except for Elena losing her dress. I do think, though, that the confessional scene courted being offensive and could have been handled with more respect. But, those two things were the only down side for me and, really, in today's anything goes to offend you world, pretty minor. Everything else was just sit back and enjoy pure fantasy, romance, comedy and rollicking adventure. I laughed, I cheered, I held my breath, I wept and I savored sweet revenge.

Fun, witty dialog that had me laughing out loud.4.  Great, unbelievable, over-the-top fight scenes (even if there were too many of them).5.  Lots of physical, slapstick comedy -- especially when Alejandro was trying to steal the horse!6.  Catherine Zeta-Jones -- a beautiful and talented actress who can play comedy AND drama quite well.7.

This is the way they used to be; great stunts, great fights, and great fun. If you want a film that's both exciting and enjoyable for the whole family, look no further than this gem. Lovers of the old swashbuckling classics will go for this too. It brings to mind the good old days of Errol Flynn, performing death-defying leaps, sword in hand, as he battles the evil villain. OK, so it's predictable, and it's not the sort of thing that would happen- but who cares, it still manages to be exciting  and a real entertainer. And, whatever people say, the fights are some of the best in movie history, second only perhaps to the duel between Stewart Granger and James Mason in the 50's version of the 'Prisoner of Zenda'. The climax is a great spectacle, with brilliant specail effects. I'm even going to go as far to say that it's even better than 'The Mark of Zorro' with Tyronne Power- for one thing, the lush colour helps, and for another it bosts greater action. You can see that this is made for cinema- I, unfortunately, didn't get to see it there, but it just comes out of the TV screen at you. Imagine how great it would be in Virtual Reality- WOW! I can't begin to! See this now- miss it and you miss out on one of the best films you'll see, a great, lighthearted, action-packed adventure from start to finish!

This is an enjoyable film that reminded me of the old Musketeer films staring Richard Chamberlain.This film was also interesting to me on a historical level as it is set in the days when Spain still had control over areas of northern America, such as California. However after I'd seen this film something bugged me about it for days later and then I suddenly realized what it was  there's an American soldier in this film in a Union uniform who seemed rather anachronistic. Wasn't the Union formed after the American civil war and wasn't that after the state of California had become part of the rest of the northern states and under control of the English ?

And after Banderas started singing (well, they called it singing I suppose) he now starts dancing as well, and that's one of the best scenes of the whole movie I think.

She starts speaking to the woman and another younger woman tells her that she only speaks ""Qechua"", obviously a local Indian language.Quechua is spoken today by approximately ten million people and is the most common of the indigenous lanquages of the New World.

Hopkins, Zeta-Jones and Banderas give splendid performances. Believable chemistry with these fine actors. Rent it, BUY it--it's worth seeing.",The Mask of Zorro
188,beeza,Old Fashioned Swashbuckler,10,6 July 2000,"A good old fashioned movie in the Hollywood swashbuckler style.  Anthony Hopkins certainly gives Antonio Banderas a run for his money in the sexy stakes, despite the age difference. Catherine Zeta Jones manages to be a heroine without being annoying or the pathetic woman that always falls over during the chase and has to be picked up...you know the type.  This movie has everything, adventure, romance and comedy.  I thoroughly recommend it for a family evening in.",The Mask of Zorro
189,xffanatic_4ever,Best Movie Ever,10,18 March 2001,"This movie is my favorite movie ever (next to x-files).  I really didn't want to see it, but I'm so glad my mother dragged me.  It has everything I love in a movie.  And I have a new favorite actress now; Catherine Zeta-Jones.   I can proudly say I knew her when no one else could even say her name.  Must See!",The Mask of Zorro
190,xffanatic_4ever,OH MY GOD!!!,10,30 June 2002,"I DID NOT want to see this film.  My mother literally DRAGGED me to see it with her (she loved the old TV show).  I sat in the theater frowning cursing my luck.  I mean, Antonio Banderas is hot, but really...ZORRO?! I'd say about...15 minutes later (including previews mind you), I was sitting like an idiot with this frozen smile on my face, that just said ""WOW!""  I'm not going to bother wasting time explaining the plot, I'm here for praise only.  Not only were the special effects great; how long's it been since a really good sword fight scene in movies?  Or stunts on horses? Too long!  The chemistry between Antonio Banderas & Catherine Zeta-Jones leapt off of the screen, and you really believed they were madly in love. That dance scene, their first fly-by-night encounter, the sword fight in the barn; HOT HOT HOT.  With her first American hit, CZJ instantly became my new favorite actress, and has been ever since.  I could go on forever about this film, the good-the bad-the ugly...rather the good-the great-the excellent. But I won't; I'll leave with one final thought; THIS MOVIE MADE THE SUMMER OF '98! After my mother literally DRAGGING me in, she also literally had to DRAG me out!  I didn't leave until all the credits were over, as well as the beautiful love song by Marc Anthony & Tina Arena which totally encompassed every aspect of emotion in the entire movie, as well as the relationship between Diego & Elena.  That's right folks, even the soundtrack rocked! SO, that's it, if you haven't seen this movie, shame on you, you should be ashamed, you...have to see it! GO! NOW! Drop everything! Stop reading this...and go buy this film!One last thought for already huge fans: there's a sequel on the way!!!!!",The Mask of Zorro

This story was something that would completely disinterest me on a usual basis, and I admit if I didn't like the first twenty minutes of it I would have stopped. But that was completely not the case. The Mask Of Zorro has everything...a villain, a hero, another hero and a beautiful woman...not to mention a very beautiful man. I would recommend this movie to anyone who thinks that they don't like action or period pieces. Needless to say that I am anticipating the sequel. Zorro, who knew?",The Mask of Zorro

This version of Zorro was funny, adventurous, heroic and just plain good.  I used to love to watch the old black and white Zorro on Saturday mornings, and this made me feel like a kid again.  I rented the video of the Mask of Zorro with no expectations, especially after some of the recent terrible remakes of old favorites.  It was such a pleasure because it wasn't full of blood, cursing or innappropriate nudity, or boring special effects.  It had a story and was just good clean fun and I recommend it highly.  Antonio Banderas was fun and gorgeous, Anthony Hopkins was his usual debonair self, the girl was no shrinking violet and the bad guys were very interestingly bad.",The Mask of Zorro
197,bruno-36,Great Swashbuckler,7,21 January 1999,I rented this movie after seeing the hype and thought it would be worth a watch. I was surprised by several things. One Hopkins can really act. I've enjoyed his performances in the past and he brings so much to a movie that a lot of little imperfections (like historical facts) can be overlooked. I was surprised also by the sword play in this movie. It was magnificent. As a kid I used to watch the old pirate and musketeer type movies and loved the sword fighting. This was equal to any of the old masterpieces. Lastly I was blown away by Catherine Zeta-Jones. I had only briefly seen her in the past and I thought she did a great job. Banderas did a great job as well but he just has too much macho bs in him for me. Overall I rated it a 7 and worth a look see.,The Mask of Zorro
198,june114,I absolutely loved this movie!,10,28 May 2000,"This movie is one of my favorites! It included everything a great movie needs: hot actors/actresses, romance, action, comedy, great costumes, great settings, great everything! Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins, and Catherine Zeta-Jones shined together! Stuart Wilson and Matthew Lestcher were also great. This movie is a great family movie and I recommend it to everyone!",The Mask of Zorro
199,star_gazer_1628,Zorro Rides Again!,9,14 February 2007,"(Don't know if there are any spoilers here, but just in case) First saw this film when it was on TV a couple of years ago. Wow. I'd not long ago seen ""Shrek 2"" and my dad was going on about how so much of Puss In Boots' character had been taken from Zorro that I decided I wanted to have a look. I got my chance a couple of months later, and let me tell you, I was still laughing my head off the next day.I don't care what anyone says, this movie is one of my top ten greatest films ever. The plot, the music, the scenery, the actors and the characters: Everything was amazing. It was a little darker than I first expected, particularly the ironically-named Capitan Love who murdered the trainee Zorro's brother.First of all, the plot. I'm not a stickler for historical accuracy; I just go to see a film to be entertained and gripped by the story, and ""The Mask of Zorro"" certainly did that. The way that all of the characters were linked to each other whether they knew it or not is clever: Don Diego de la Vega (elder Zorro) is imprisoned and has his child taken away from him by his arch enemy Don Rafael Montero, Governor of California. Rafael takes the child, Elena, and raises her as his own. Twenty years later, his right-hand man, one Captain Love, finds the infamous Murrieta brothers, Joaquin and Alejandro, killing the elder brother, Joaquin. Alejandro swears that he will kill the Captain, and meets Don Diego, who escaped from jail. The pair work together to thwart Montero's plans, and along the way, Alejandro falls in love with Elena, but is unaware that she is his mentor's daughter. Phew, it's kinda complicated, but it works really well. The music. Superb score, apart from that one song, ""Spend My Lifetime Loving You"", which was fine in a quick snippet, but having the singers belting it out in the credits is a bit much. The one that sticks in my mind the most is in the first scene when Zorro is astride a rearing Tornado after saving the men from being killed, the sun setting in the background and the crowd cheering. Beautiful. The scenery. Set in 1840s California but filmed in the wonderful locations of Mexico. All the rich reds and browns create a powerful and wonderful background for the actors.Now, the cast. I personally think that they all performed brilliantly, and Anthony Hopkins was regal as Don Diego de la Vega, aka Zorro. Catherine Zeta Jones swashbuckles her way onto the silver screen with a brilliant performance, particularly in the duelling scene between Elena and Alejandro. Antonio Banderas is brilliant, he has a great sense of comic timing, and when he tries to get the horse, well. It was about five minutes before I recovered. ""Hey, estupido!"" he cries, and the horse reluctantly trots over. He smiles to himself and leaps from the rooftop, only for the horse to walk forward and let him crash to the ground. I was in hysterics. He and Hopkins bring a charm to the character that makes you say 'this is how Zorro is supposed to be played'. Stuart Wilson is suitably devious as the evil Don Rafael Montero, and Matthew Letscher plays a good part as the nemesis of the younger Zorro, you can really feel his hatred for Alejandro.Some people do not realise this, but for most of the time, it is really the actors who are doing all the sword-fighting and some of the stunts. The duel between Elena and Alejandro is brilliant; there is such a great chemistry between the two leads. One of my favourite scenes of the whole movie has to be the one where Zorro takes on a group of about twenty soldiers and wins. The look on his face when he realises that the gunpowder fuse is coming towards him is hilarious!I don't care what anyone says, I love this movie and would encourage anyone who hasn't seen it to rent it, or if you own it, view it again and have a good time. It is great to just sit back once in a while and enjoy a movie with humour and action that doesn't have to rely on huge explosions, (OK, this film has two, but that's it!) bad language and car chases. I do like a good action film, but it is nice to dive into the past and watch something different that can make you laugh, cry and cheer the heroes on until the very end.",The Mask of Zorro
200,harvey_osullivan,Boring,1,29 November 2002,"This movie is blindingly dull, Banderras is a wooden actor at the best of times, here is a role which possibly suits him yet he doesn't get a chance to shine, the directors fault maybe?What is Hopkins doing in this movie? Does he need the money that bad?Anyway, whos idea was it to make movie anyway? Who cares about Zorro movies, swashbuckling movies are dated and dull, the action is boring and unexciting (compare any of these action scenes with say a Jackie Chan movie like Project A and you'll know what an exciting action scene can be), the script is trite and predictable, and the direction sucks, in fact everything about this movie is just so mind numbingly dull don't waste your breath on it.",The Mask of Zorro

Anthony Hopkins as the original Zorro - driven by his need for his daughter to know him - is superb.  Antonio Banderas always seems to know how to have fun, his character is less driven than in Desperado but still fuelled by revenge.  Catherine Zeta Jones is wonderful; sensual and (sometimes) in control.Overall, the best movie I have seen in a long time.  Can't wait for it to come out on satellite, then I can watch it again.",The Mask of Zorro

I won't say that this was 'edge of your seat summer entertainment that will keep your eyes glued to the end from start to finish.'  It is, however an enjoyable two and a half hours to spend.  The characters do seem to have motivation for their actions.  The music reminded me of the scores from 'Braveheart' and 'Waterworld' a little too much but it is still forgivable.  Plus the movie reminds us that Zorro was not merely a swordsman fighting and killing to protect his fellow men but was a charming man who knew how and when to fight as well as how and when to escape.  The most brilliant scenes are not those that are filled with the swordplay but are those in which Zorro must escape from overwhelming odds.  Recommended.",The Mask of Zorro

Hopkins and Bandaras just shine as Zorro and the Zorro for the future.  Zeta-Jones is so lovely, and I'll never forget her description of Zorro to her father, ""he was vigorous, very vigorous.""

The thing that most attracted me were the three amazing leads.  Hopkins, Bandaras, and Zeta-Jones rock the screen just as good as that awesome explosion at the end.  That summer I had also seen Armageddon, I thought those explosions were interesting (no, I am not an explosion freak), but from the sound of it, the Zorro bang was totally real.

Both Zorro's did a good job, especially in the sword fights. They second Zorro, looked more like ""Zorro"" though. However, the first one makes a fitting Zorro too.

Zeta Jones is truly radiant in this role, a true beauty. Her acting is flawless and despite the fact she was relatively unknown at the time she stands up well against the amazing Antonio Banderas. I've seen this movie countless times and don't think I do it justice enough in reviewing it and calling it a ""classic"" It's a truly amazing story along the old style, action adventure theme of a thief seeking revenge for his brother, and ends up being trained by the great Zorro.

The plot is set in motion by the characters motivations, and a few classic themes are explored here, especially the ideas of revenge and retribution.  The acting is superb; and the casting is excellent.  Antonio Banderas was made for this role, and his costars add brilliance to a wonderful story.  It does lack on some characterization of the ""villians"", and most interesting is what seems like an involved background story.  I'm sure a sequel will definitely happen in the near future.

227,SteveQ,see this movie!!!,9,6 January 1999,"Good Points:All of the actors (that counts actresses): excellent.  I can't think of a bad performance among them.The Action: Some sword fighting moves looked contrived, but many looked authentic and exciting, esp between Alejandro & Diego (Hopkins) and Alejandro & Elena.The Plot:  Well done.  Not forced/contrived.  Easy to follow.The Writing:  From the intimidating Z of fire, to the Captain's water jug, to Jedi-like training, to the civilized & gentlemanly dialog (no foul language I can recall either), to a man's pain & struggle to recover his family, to a great bad-guy-death scenario, to a legend-in-training and a horse that won't put up with his arrogance and how so many little things are linked together.Highlights: ** Elena's subtle disappointment, in front of her ""father"", that Zorro ""didn't do anything"" to her and how ""vigorous"" he was. ** Elena's & Alejandro's dancing!  Spectacular! ** Alejandro's ins and outs of understanding and arrogance about actually being this legend in the flesh; here you really get a feel for what it's like through the eyes of a truly human ""hero"", or at least someone like you or I trying to become a hero, unlike Batman who does nothing so adoringly human. ** The ""taming"" of the horse.  Enuff said. ** Elena's gradual and believable story arc of suspicion and ultimate realization about her true past. ** I'm a straight male, so it simply MUST be said: Elena is SOOOO HOT!  WOW!  There's no escaping it.I'm sure there's more but it's late at night and I've only seen this once (but I plan on more!).Bad Points:Hopkins doesn't look or sound the least bit Hispanic (but he's still great and it can be overlooked)The Ending: Obviously predictable, but that's actually not the bad part. (Hey, you knew the Titanic would sink, even how it would sink from the beginning, and that didn't take away from the movie!)  Elena could have cut the fuse, the ppl didn't look like they had enough time to get out, and everyone walking through the dust afterward was WAAAY too sappy & over-dramatized.Still, see this!",The Mask of Zorro

Sure, some of the fighting scenes seemed at times a bit undramatic, but maybe that's because of the normalization of fast cutting in today's cinema. In the end it really didn't matter.I guess the main plot was that Diego and Alejandro both wanted revenge. And that makes Rafael's plan to buy California, using slaves as gold diggers, the subplot. The subplot seemed a bit forced in that it almost felt like an excuse to bring Zorro into the whole thing. Both Diego and Alejandro could've gotten their revenge without the whole Zorro-thing. But then it wouldn't have been a Zorro-movie, now would it?Another thing I found a bit funny was how fast Elena turned her back on Rafael - whom for her had been her father for 20 years - when she learnt the truth. Sure, he was strict, indirectly killed your mother, imprisoned your real father and used children and disabled people as slaves, but wouldn't you still feel some sort of love for him? At least enough to not release the man who surely will kill him?All of this is just nitpicking. It was an enjoyable watch with some nice overall performances. Especially, of course, from Anthony Hopkins who is just a wonderful actor and Antonio Banderos who is both charming and funny.It was not outstanding but it was certainly a good watch.",The Mask of Zorro
233,writestuff_2001,One of the greatest swashbucklers of all time,10,18 June 2002,"""The Mask of Zorro"" is one of the best adventures films I've ever seen, period.  It's a first class production straight down the line.  Banderas, Zeta-Jones, Hopkins, and the underrated Stuart Wilson all perform their roles admirably.  Martin Campbell's direction is crisp. James Horner's score enhances the action rather than overwhelming it. And the sword fighting action is as good as you'll ever see in a non-martial arts film.  (Bob Anderson was the sword master on this production.  Every movie he's worked on that I've seen has featured terrific swordplay action.  ""The Mask of Zorro"" is no exception.)Even though this film was largely ignored at the box office, ""The Mask of Zorro"" remains a favorite of mine.  If I went off to a desert island and could only take a few videos with me, this would definitely be one of them.",The Mask of Zorro

His little antics and expressions are so subtle but impactful you can't take your eyes of the screen!",The Mask of Zorro

237,luke-11,It's a classic matinée show,7,29 October 1998,"The Mask of Zorro is a classic movie, with excellent performance by Anthony Hopkins, Antonio Banderes and Catherine Zeta-Jones. The director, Martin Campbell, who directed the last James Bond, movie, really understands how to make a good movie with a poor script, since the script doesn't pretend to be more than a matinée show.The good parts of the movie is where Hopkins and Banderas are playing opposite each other, and when the movie portraits the struggle for wealth and power among the establishment contrary the reason why the peasants rebellioned in the former Spanish colony and why Mexico became independent in 1822.The above theme is dominating the movie and as long the movie avoids the confrontation between Alejandro Murrieta's past and his earlier wrong-doings in contrast to the profile of Zorro as the keeper of justice, the movie doesn't cross the border.Another good thing about the movie is fighting scenes, where every move has been choreographed without any errors and expresses the right form between drama and action just like in Scaramouche (1952).On the negative part is the last struggle in the goldmine between Zorro/de la Vega and Don Montero/Captain Love, which takes place in broad daylight. This is disaster and the result would have been much improved, if the scene and the last big explosion had taken place in the dark.",The Mask of Zorro

Hopkins is great; so is Banderas as Zorro-in-training, and Zeta-Jones sparkles in her scenes with him. Very little gore or skin, what there is serves the plot instead of BEING the plot. The best movie I've seen in a long time. Note: previews make it look a lot less interesting than it actually is--you just see a lot of things being slashed and blown up, while the comic scenes between Hopkins and Banderas don't really appear (the best part of the film).",The Mask of Zorro

Action, romance, humour and a great set in which to host the event. Good to see a '90s movie holding true to a fifties TV style authentic western feel. What a great transition from 'OLD small TV screen' to the big screen. Possibly the best remake of an old idea seen in the last five years. It stands head and shoulders above the likes of Phantom and The Saint. Can they do likewise with 'The Lone Ranger""? I don't recall a swear word in the script... am I disappointed to miss it... NOT!

255,mendelson.2,Quite simply the best action film of the 1990s,10,13 July 2003,"As stated in the above lead, Mask of Zorro is the very best adventure film in the past ten years.  A glorious throwback to a time when adventure films actually had complicated but logical stories, rich, multi-layered characters who could surprise us, and action scenes aplenty, but only when the story called for them.  When action scenes involved real stuntmen doing incredible, but plausible feats of derring-do.  When swashbuckling showcased glorious swordplay and footwork, shot in wide, long takes.  When real actors created real characters, never assuming that the action genre allows dumbing down the basics.You can read the plot synopsis elsewhere, but know only that this is perhaps the finest superhero film ever made.  It's nice and long (130 minutes), so it can have lots of action while still having plenty of time for character development and plot mechanics.  It's filled with rich, multilayered heroes and villains and top-notch acting that never condescends (this is the rare film where Antonio Bandaras is allowed to relieve his comic roots and Anthony Hopkins doesn't thumb his nose at the material).  The James Horner score is lush, rising, and (for him) surprisingly original.  The plot makes an incredible amount of sense, and the obligitory ""evil scheme"" is actually quite ingenious.More than any action film in recent memory, everything just works.  This one deserves comparison with Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Adventures of Robin Hood.",The Mask of Zorro

With this and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" they have crafted two of the most entertaining and fun adventures since Douglas Fairbanks Jr. was wielding a big sword. This movie is a great throwback to those old Raoul Walsh/Allan Dwan adventure movies from the 1920's-1930's, with much better acting and production values of course. Like another reviewer said, the simpleness and predictable storyline are for once fun, mainly because the action scenes and romance scenes are well interspersed with the action and director Martin Campbell has a light touch through the whole thing as to not make it so serious. Like Pirates, Robin Hood, Indiana Jones, etc. this film is the kind that people watch all the time and turn into a perennial favorite and I am glad it has discovered such a fanbase.",The Mask of Zorro

The current reviews do not by any means accurately reflect how great The Mask is Zorro is. Antonio Banderas and Anthony Hopkins have great chemistry and comedic timing. Each of their characters have personal vendettas against the two villains, and the stunts are awesome!

Costumes and drama brings back history to live. Music is fantastic and appropriate for each scene. No sexual content, and therefore, you can watch with your family. How ever, there are some gruesome violence. Severed head was in display. Horse chasing and sward fighting are remarkable.Student-teacher relationship, a talented master's attitude and remarkable display of a skilled warrior are presented in a memorable way in this movie. It could easily be a collector's selection. Because, you can watch it again and again without getting bored. Deceptive tactics of political rebels are justified, which, some people may disagree with. Stripping the heroine in duel was interesting, but, whether it was a part of history is unknown. However, that piece is the only sexual content in this movie.

This movie had everything. Action, love and a little humor. I think someone said that the new zorro learned how to fight in one day and this was believable. Well lets see did you see Once Upon A Time in Mexico? How many people did Ananito kill in that movie at one setting? So quit nick picking on Zorro. I can't wait for the next one to come out which I understand won't be long now. I think Hopkins did a great job as the old zorro. I was kind of disappointed that they killed him off just when he found his daughter again. Maybe they could have had him live and he could have continued to help the new Zorro and meet is grand daughter. Hopkins did a great job as a teacher.

The sword-fighting, the Spanish dancing, the parties, and the excitement; it enthralled me. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time I watched the movie.Some of the scenes were a little graphic--the executions and such--but all in all, it was an unforgettable movie for me. It was serious, but also funny at the same time.The action scenes superb as well! Zorro was made out to be an amazing character, with all the aerobatics he could do.Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta-Jones had wonderful chemistry on screen. They seemed to not be able to get enough of each other. From dancing to sword-fighting, they were an irresistible couple.Anthony Hopkins did a good job in his portrayal of the older Zorro, but I found it very hard to believe that he was young in the first scenes of the movie. Despite the fact that they dyed his hair and tried to make him seem more alert and peppy, it didn't seem to work so well.Some of the scenes were a little graphic--the executions and such--but all in all, it was an unforgettable movie for me.

Yes. Hot girl? Yes. Romance? Yes. Swords? Yes. Guns? Yes. Masked hero? Yes. Oppressed masses? Evil capitalists? Popular uprising? Board meeting of evil people? Father-daughter reunion? Master-protégé type situation? Masked dude kissing a girl and meeting her for a dance (sans mask)? Protégé marrying master's daughter and doing the same as he did?The action scenes were too long and boring. The baddies are just a series of people that Zorro has to beat up. There's no consequence to any of it. He doesn't get captured or hurt. A conveyor belt of tasks rolls faces to his fist/sword and he does what he must.This film needed to be dark, something like Batman, but instead it seems to be intended for children. Catherine Zeta Jones is there to attract adult men, and the romance and father-daughter stuff is there for women, I guess?This film tries to go for everyone, but ends up being for no one.",The Mask of Zorro

The Music and the Scenery give it that extra Spanish kick. This movie has one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard, James Horner did a remarkable job with this one. Antonio Banderas and Catherine Zeta Jones, do an excellent job in playing their roles, but the more inspirational character is Don Diego De La Vega played by Anthony Hopkins, with his wise teachings on life and training. He did a great job with this one, and his appearance is really eye catching, especially how he looks dressed as Zorro. This movie is underrated, but definitely one of Hopkins'best.The story is written very well, from start to finish, and by far, the best Zorro movie. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, I love how it explores the old Mexican cultures. It sorta makes you want to go dine in a Classy Mexican Restaurant, or perhaps listen to some old Spanish Tunes. One thing about this movie is that it has a serious tone, and less laughable parts. (Comparing to The Legend Of Zorro, 2005), and this of course, makes it more meaningful to watch, but nevertheless, a good, clean classic. This is a true Hero movie with an excellent story behind it.The Mask Of Zorro, one of the best. 10/10",The Mask of Zorro
