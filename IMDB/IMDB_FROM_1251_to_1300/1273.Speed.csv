0,Leofwine_draca,Inimitable bomb-on-a-bus thriller packs in the excitement,9,29 December 2016,"This high-octane thriller is a pretty good example of 'does what it says on the tin' film-making. There's a bus that'll explode if it slows down. End of story. The concept in itself is workable, but the film, directed by Jan De Bont's sure hand, is excellent, a real action classic with super-fast pacing and a storyline that never lets up. Things kick off with a tense rescue-trapped-passengers-in-an-elevator bid and are enlivened by an exploding bus shock scene.We're then into the heart of the story, on board of a primed-to-explode bus, and all the genre clichés are in place, albeit in a slick and well-oiled form. Keanu Reeves plays the young hero (not as good as in THE MATRIX but pretty good) and Dennis Hopper is his overacting nemesis, chewing the scenery with relish. There's a heady combination of stunt work, sudden death, explosions, and tense shoot-outs and the film truly lives up to its ""Die Hard on a bus"" tagline. The only weak links are a hang-dog Jeff Daniels, miscast in a non-comedic role, and Sandra Bullock, whose ditzy, screamy heroine quickly becomes grating. An intelligent script is the real highlight of this slightly workmanlike, but nonetheless excellent, thriller.",Speed
1,SnoopyStyle,uncredited Joss Whedon script doctoring shines through,8,27 September 2013,"A psychopathic bomber (Dennis Hopper) is extorting the city. He has rigged an elevator full of people to plummet. Young brash cop Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and his steady partner Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) foil the bomber's plan in a nick of time. Then the bomber blows up a bus, and tells Traven that he will blow another one. When the bus hits 50 mph, the bomb will arm and explode if it slows below 50. The driver gets shot and Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) has to take over. The premise is simple to understand. It's visceral and easy. But it's all about the fun dialog from Joss Whedon. It's snappy and fun. Sandra Bullock is the perfect conduit to put all those exchanges. At the start, Jeff Daniels and Keanu Reeves have that great chemistry. Then they switch it to Sandra. The writing really puts it over the top of just another good action thriller.",Speed
2,Horst_In_Translation,"Fun over realism admittedly, but I enjoyed it",6,23 July 2017,"""Speed"" is an American English-language film from 1994, so two more years only until this one has its 25th anniversary. It was directed by Jan de Bont (actually the first directorial effort of this prolific cinematographer) and written by Graham Yost and for both of them this (almost) 2-hour movie is among their most famous. One reason is that this film won 2 of its 3 Oscar nominations (lost Editing to Forrest Gump) and another is that this film is still considered one of the defining action films from the 1990s. It features the relatively young Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock and (the not so young) Dennis Hopper. This is obviously not a film about individual performances, but it needs to be said that Reeves was working the part nicely and Hopper was also good, but admittedly had very little to work with in terms of both screen time and material. Bullock on the other hand I don't even think the performance was a problem at all, but eventually her portrayal was the weakest from the entire film and it is ridiculous she even got awards attention for her turn. It is the epitome of a badly-written female character in an action movie. Early on she gets hit on by a guy who is somewhat of a mini antagonist, but of course she is too good for him and then there are these banter moments with Reeves' character and we knew exactly where this was heading. She is a tough intelligent woman, but needs constant saving and nice words from the big hero. I cannot deny I would have preferred her character to be left completely out of the picture, but I guess they did not want to go for a sausage fest. Oh well.Back to the positive: This film has a fairly massive runtime, but it never drags and has no lengths at all I would say. They weren't scared of sacrificing several of the good characters to show how evil the bad guy was and this is a brave approach that we do not always get. I also found it interesting how the movie, fitting the title, moves from slow to fast methods of transportation. It all starts in an elevator, then a bus (the core of the film), and eventually a metro train. Talking about the metro train, fans of the television show ""The West Wing"" will see (and hopefully enjoy) a familiar face in there. Back to this one here, this is not a film you want to go for if you are in need of realism. There were probably a hundred aspects that would not happen like that in reality or we can also include unrealistic plot developments here. There is a hole in the road and the rails aren't finished either? Nah. Also admittedly the screenplay is not particularly creative as all the ideas are fairly simple really, like the traffic jam or the lack of fuel etc. But I will admit they still worked. As did the entire film. It has its weaknesses and I would not call it a classic, but it was a genuinely entertaining two hours. I give it a thumbs-up and recommend checking it out.",Speed
3,Prismark10,There is a bomb on the bus,9,10 September 2014,"Speed is a terrific action blockbuster. I like to say high adrenaline but I am just limited to 50 Miles per hour!Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) is a LA police officer who locks horn with ex cop Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) who is hacked off with his retirement.Traven and his partner Harry (Jeff Daniels) has stopped Payne from blowing up a building.Now cunningly Payne has rigged a bus that will blow up if its speed drops below 50 MPH. Annie (Sandra Bullock) a passenger ends up driving the bus and Traven must save the passengers.The screenplay was probably destined to be Die Hard on a bus. There is a terrific bad guy, some nice humour, lots of action and suspense.It all makes for an enjoyable ride. There is good interplay with Reeves and Bullock. Although the filmmakers know they are not making high art they have given it enough love and attention to make the film an enduring classic.Maybe the film is overlong with an elaborate ending which they could had done without.",Speed
4,kosmasp,Do you feel the need .. the need for ...,9,24 June 2021,"No this has nothing at all to do with Top Gun - I just tried to be funny with this one. And it was quite a nice throwback. So I don't think I was overthinking the movie or its plot or anything ... and the writer and producer are right: the movie moves so fast, you don't really have time to think about how much sense it makes ... as in none.Talking about those two and while their audio commentary is from 2001, it feels as fresh as anything ... and self depravating too. And you won't even really realize anything wrong with Keanu (some have issues with his ""acting"") - this is suiting him good. And having the amazing Dennis Hopper as the main villain here works more than wonders.The movie is quite brutal though at times ... actually starts off with a bloody knife kill. There may be no nudity, but the R-Rating is deserved I'd say. Funny to hear that Halle Berry was up for the role that finally went to Sandra Bullock ... while I am pleased with the end result, I can't help but wonder ... that aside the movie is as nonsensical as I described it, so if you have issues with that (or the violence) you may not feel the 9 rating is deserved ... just try to free yourself of those feelings. And enjoy this rollercoaster ride ... I have not yet seen the sequel .. but I don't think I will like it as much as I did this.",Speed
5,classicsoncall,"""Excuse me. Are you out of your mind?""",8,20 May 2021,"Come on, you know it's impossible, but once you get caught up in the adrenaline rush it's hard to let go. I felt my foot tapping throughout this picture, keeping time with that speeding bus and groaning every time it made one of those impossible stunts. The freeway ramp was the clincher, no way that could happen but by that time you're simply along for the ride and can't let go. I think this was my first look at Sandra Bullock when I saw this so many years ago, a little too calm under pressure and not a drop of perspiration to indicate how tense her situation was. This was made a full two decades before Keanu Reeves' turn as John Wick, and it was like a warm up for all those nasty bumps he would take as an ex-hitman coming out of retirement. More than one thing doesn't ring true in this picture, like the bus passengers cheering with every successful maneuver, but what else were they gonna do? A big question mark was how Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) made it out of the very first explosion scenario following the elevator incident to open the picture, but once things get under way that kind of gets lost in the shuffle. As a caper flick, this isn't one of your standard rob the vault deals, but it's just as tricky and way over the top. Put you mind on hold for a couple hours and you'll have a good time with this one. You'll never look at a ride on a bus the same way again.",Speed
6,gavin6942,Who Would Believe An Action Film Could Actually Be Good?,8,21 June 2010,"""Speed"", with bad actors Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock, poor dialogue and a plot that is completely pointless and nonsense, on top of the fact the bus making a jump... not going to happen. How is it that a film that is so bad could actually be so good? Because, let's face it, it's extremely enjoyable, popular and heavily quotable.I blame Joss Wheadon, who was a script doctor on this before becoming a big writer. He could fix just about anything, probably. And maybe having Dennis Hopper helped, too. He's like the perfect villain, so having him here being all creepy and devious pays off. I mean, sure, you could have hired his buddy Jack Nicholson, but there's a difference between crazy creepy and devious creepy.",Speed
7,lee_eisenberg,sped up to actually having a plot,7,24 April 2006,"If you look at ""Speed""'s plot, it sounds like any old ridiculous Hollywood movie: madman plants bomb on bus, cop has to stop bus from blowing up. Usually, I wouldn't even consider watching such a movie. However, Dennis Hopper as the terrorist carries the movie. His character Howard Payne is sort of a cross between his characters from ""Easy Rider"" and ""Apocalypse Now"", albeit totally evil. Keanu Reeves's character is one whom anyone could have played and it wouldn't be much different, although who else would say ""whoa"" like Reeves? And Sandra Bullock's character isn't bad.All in all, this is an above average action flick. Not a masterpiece by any stretch, but better than the usual Stallone or Schwarzenegger movie. Also starring Joe Morton, Jeff Daniels, Alan Ruck and Beth Grant.And one more thing: avoid the sequel like you would the Ebola virus!",Speed
8,jboothmillard,Speed,10,2 March 2007,"I had seen bits of the not-so-good sequel, I had seen the Father Ted spoof episode, ""Speed 3"", and now I have actually seen it, I love it! It does start a little slow with the opening credits and an elevator shaft, but the music is what keeps me interested. It then moves to the scene where the great villain, Howard Payne (a great Dennis Hopper) has planted a bomb on an elevator and held people inside ransom for $3.7m, and the heroes, Officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and Det. Harold 'Harry' Temple (Jeff Daniels, in a serious role, cool) manage to save the hostages, while Payne escapes. But it is not over for Traven, not long later he sees a bus explode, and is told on a near public phone that there is a bus with a bomb on it. If it goes over 50mph it is set, but if it goes below 50mph, it blows, and if anyone besides him gets off, he blows it. It is now a race against time, before 11pm, to figure some way to stop the bomb, or save the passengers, including revoked driver Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock), who returned in the sequel. Oh, and when they do stop it, it concludes with a speeding train chase. There are some fantastic twists in this adrenalin filled high action thriller. Also starring Terminator 2's Joe Morton as Capt. McMahon, Alan Ruck as Stephens, Saw II's Glenn Plummer as Jaguar Owner, Richard Lineback as Norwood, Beth Grant as Helen, Hawthorne James as Sam and Carlos Carrasco as Ortiz. It won the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, and it won the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best Sound, and it was nominated for Best Special Effects. Dennis Hopper was number 80 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 49 on The World's Greatest Actor, and the film was number 99 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Outstanding!",Speed
9,ccthemovieman-1,"Fun Story, But You Can't Find Dumber Leads Or Dialog",4,14 August 2006,"Yeah, I know this was a huge hit, and I enjoyed it when I first saw it, too, but on the second viewing, Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves - two of the dumbest-sounding actors in recent memory - made this too annoying for future viewings.Bullock, an airhead who has made very few, if any, good movies, must have majored in using God's name solely in exclamation, because that's about all she can say. This is probably Reeve's best role, which isn't saying much because he's normally as wooden-sounding as Pinochhio. To have both of these ""actors"" in the same movie, and still have it a big hit is a tribute to how well the suspense was made in this film, and how indiscriminating the public is when it comes to their actors, or the dialog in a film which is even worse in this movie than the actors.Nobody, but nobody, would make the kind of remarks the characters make it this film. Dennis Hopper's villainous character also gives us the Hollywood cliché of talking- instead-killing to the maximum here - another insult to any viewer of any intelligence.Having said all of that, the film gets points for having a simple-but very involving and interesting premise and a few spectacular action scenes that got everyone excited about seeing the film back in the mid '90s. So, if you can just put brain in a freezer for two hours, you have an entertaining film, and that still is worth something.",Speed
10,rmax304823,Movie Culture,4,24 January 2002,"It's always interesting to look at movies through history as if they were all part of the same overall culture, drawing on similar behavioral conventions and technologies. Like living cultures, movies have a historical context, undergo innovations, evolve over time to reflect changing folkways, and so forth. Speed gives us an ultimate example of innovation and originality, leading through convention, to utter decadence. There have been speed movies ever since there were movies and they were new and exciting at the beginning. The Keystone Kops were pretty good. Then they became conventional, with Model As careering around urban corners, tommy guns blazing out the windows; Bogart wheeling his speeding coupe up the slopes towards Mount Whitney in accelerated time. The big ones were saved until the movie's end usually. Then the car chase underwent what anthropologists call a revitalization movement. I'm talking about Bullitt. Nothing like this chase had (or has) been put on film. Then we enter a period of decadence, which we may define as increasingly perfunctory repetition and variation of a once-original idea. (The ancient Egyptians drew very careful open hands in their hieroglyphic script. Over the millenia, with less attention being paid and with a good deal of sloppy borrowing going on, the open palm managed to turn into a simple delta shape, from which we get our letter D. That's decadence. It's a real thing.) Well, if it's good once, let's do it again and make another nickel. Other outrageous chases followed in The French Connection, the Seven Ups, and so on; nicely choreographed but no longer original. Now the public has seen enough car chases. Let's introduce other vehicles into the chase. We can use a runaway cruise ship. Let's put the chase at the beginning -- why make the audience wait until the end? Beverly Hills Cop STARTS with a chase involving a car and some kind of garbage truck. Finally we reach a sort of climax with Speed. With the exception of some shenanigans on and in an elevator, the entire movie is one big chase involving diverse vehicles, most prominently a bus. Sandra Bullock is cute as the wisecracking girl drawn into the plot. Keanu Reeves is clean-cut and handsome, no more than that. But none of that matters. The only important thing is that lumbering behemoth banging cars off the freeway, leaping through 50 feet of open space, and smashing everything in sight. It's thrilling. Of course it's thrilling. We could dispense with the characters entirely and it would still be thrilling -- a thrilling hour and a half of a bus zipping along the streets of Los Angeles like a juggernaut and demolishing everything it can.I'm wondering. Surely they have a video game for children out by now, called ""Speed."" One point for each traffic sign or highway cone. You get five points for squashing a pedestrian. Ten points for a wrecking a car. Fifteen points for a truck. Glancing blows earn you half credits. If you turn too quickly and flop over, or if you hit a locomotive, you lose.",Speed
11,Tweekums,Fast moving thriller,9,15 November 2012,"As the film opens thirteen people board a lift in a Los Angeles skyscraper; moments later a bomb cuts the cable and it drops; the emergency brakes hold it in position but the people are trapped thirty storeys up. A disaster hasn't been averted; that was just to get everybody's attention; the bomber wants three million dollars or he will set off a second bomb removing the breaks! Some films might spend the next hour and a half working out how to save them but here this is just a taster of the bomber's behaviour. Cops Jack Traven and Harry Temple manage to free the hostages and after a confrontation in the basement it looks as if the bomber has blown himself to bits that is until he strikes again some time later. He blows up a bus and says he will blow up a second one. The second bus has been wired so that as soon as it hits 50MPH the bomb is activated and when it decelerates below 50MPH it will explode. He clearly wants to play with Jack as he tells him where the bus is and what number it is. Jack manages to get on board and the situation soon gets worse; an accidental shooting leaves the driver severely injured so passenger, Annie Porter must take the wheel. If they are to survive she will have to keep the bus above 50MPH even when the road is full of traffic or at one point non-existent necessitating a jump! As they drive along trying to find a solution Harry manages to identify the bomber; it may be a bit late for that information to be useful though.This is a solid action movie where the tension is kept high almost from start to finish and as the bus keeps on going no matter what obstacles it meets there isn't time to look for plot holes or worry that it would be very unlikely that they could maintain that speed while doing the things it does. Keanu Reaves does a pretty good job as Jack Traven and Sandra Bullock is likable as always. Dennis Hopper puts in his trademark insane performance as bomber Howard Payne; over the top maybe but fun to watch. There isn't a huge amount of violent action but what there is is fairly intense; in the opening scene somebody is stabbed in the head, later one somebody is shot with a submachinegun and Payne is ultimately decapitated! Any fan of the action genre is likely to enjoy this and it doesn't lose any of the excitement on repeat viewings.",Speed
12,ma-cortes,Exciting movie about some desperate passengers threatened who are saved by Reeves and Bullock,7,3 February 2010,"Los Angeles SWAT daredevil cops( Keaunu Reeves, Jeff Daniels ) commanded by their chief (Joe Morton ) taking on extreme terrorist ( a bomber well performed by Dennis Hooper)who wires first an elevator and after that a public bus where a handful of characters (Alan Ruck, Carlos Carrasco, among others) face certain death . If the bus's speed down 50, it explodes. The starring hops on board but the driver is wounded and a valiant passenger (Sandra Bullock) takes the wheel. Then the bus runs , bounds and flies.This mindless, interesting and ingenious film is packed with thrills, suspense, tension and lots of interminable action. Enjoyable relationship between two main characters, Reeves and Bullock, based on risked circumstances work out pretty well. Sandra Bullock steals the show as feisty passenger and Keanu Reeves is fine as brave, intrepid police. Witty argument that dispenses excitement as well as entertainment. Packs atmospheric cinematography using Steadicam or hand-held camera by Andrej Bartkowick. And stirring musical score fitting to action by Mark Mancina . The picture is stunningly and effectively realized in his firs-time as director by Jan De Bont, a successful cameraman (Basic Instict, Die Hard) and Paul Verhoveen's usual and occasionally director (Speed 2, Twister). It's followed by inferior sequel ¨Speed II¨ with similar technician and artistic crew , starred by Sandra Bullock, Jason Patrick, Temuera Morrison and Willem Dafoe.

13,BA_Harrison,All aboard for extremely dumb action.,4,26 July 2019,"Pop quiz: you're a cinematographer given the chance to direct a high-concept action flick. What do you do? What do you do?Well, if you're Jan De Bont, you make a movie that is so action-packed that most people seem to be extremely forgiving about the film's sheer preposterousness. Your star is wooden and your bad guy is hammy, but there are more than enough explosions and stunts to keep the popcorn munchers happy, and the movie is a massive success.I was never much of a popcorn fan, and I never really understood why this film wasn't lambasted like its sequel. After an admittedly well-handled opening scene set in an elevator armed with a bomb, the film completely dispenses with logic (and the laws of physics), the silly script taking way too many liberties for my liking. Having had his elevator bomb plot foiled by young police officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and bomb disposal expert Harry (Jeff Daniels), crazy ex-cop Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) tries to hold the city to ransom once again by placing an explosive device on a bus which will detonate should the speed go below fifty miles per hour (despite the bus looking like it's going about thirty in most scenes). Boarding the bus, Jack tries to find a way to save the passengers' lives while pretty commuter Annie (Sandra Bullock) takes the wheel (the driver having been shot).Payne's plan is poorly thought out: had the driver dipped below fifty before Jack had been able to board the bus, the bomb would have gone off, leaving the extortionist with no chance of collecting his cash. Luckily for him, this doesn't happen, but this isn't the film's only dodgy plot point: there's the ridiculous gravity-defying leap across a fifty foot gap in an unfinished stretch of freeway; getting the driver off the bus is a perilous affair, but Jack casually hops off later without a hitch; bomb expert Harry and his highly trained team enter Payne's home without even considering that it might be booby-trapped; and in a very silly finale, Jack speeds up a subway train when he could have simply slowed it down.I've yet to see the sequel but surely it can't be any more inane than this one.",Speed

20,hitchcockthelegend,Speed kills.,9,17 June 2009,"Mad bomber Howard Payne is furious when one of his ransom plans is thwarted by officers Traven and Temple. So much so they become heavily involved in his next devilish plan. There is a bomb on a bus, the bomb becomes active once it reaches 50mph, the kicker being that should that bus go under 50mph, it detonates. Also a problem is that Payne is watching, so should any passengers attempt to leave the bus, he will detonate the bomb himself.Speed is implausible, daft, mindless and borderline cretinous. It's also gripping, inflammable and delightful in premise, which in the process turned it into one of the finest action movies in the modern era. Taking up directing duties for the first time is Jan de Bont, better known at the time as cinematographer for luminaries like McTiernan, Schumacher, Verhoeeven and R Scott, de Bont literally throws everything at it in case nobody lets him direct again. Cars, helicopters, buses, bikes and lifts, all are either hurtling around or exploding with visual and aural excitement. It's nonsense alright, but it's thrilling high octane nonsense, action/adventure escapism in its purest form.Depending on what sources you trust or believe, Speed was apparently born out of an unproduced idea from one Akira Kurosawa {eventually made as Runaway Train in 1985}. Screenwriter Graham Yost, who having just watched Runaway Train, felt that a ""bomb"" was badly missing from the premise, thus Speed as we now know it was born. 20th Century Fox green-lit the project {with major reservations about premise and cast} and the rest as they say, is history. The public lapped it up, stars Keanu Reeves {Traven} and Sandra Bullock {wonderful chemistry} became household names, and the 90s finally had an action movie to rival the 80s genre high that was Die Hard. Reeves, due in part to not being asked to do much outside of flex muscle and deliver cocky exuberance, firmly established a marker as an action hero. He of course would go on to deliver the magnificent Matrix and it's less than popular sequels. Bullock comes out with much credit, women in action films back then rarely did much more than scream and go doe eyed at the male lead. Here her Annie Porter holds her own under duress and the interplay with Reeves positively crackles {they may just be the prettiest on screen couple of the decade}.Ultimately it's the pace of the movie that keeps it thrilling, de Bont {sadly unable to move on to better from here} after a tight and tense lift dangle, mad Dennis Hopper {Payne} opening reel, keeps it as one seamless action set piece-and that's exactly what is required. We don't need to think or worry about any extraneous filler, we don't have time, for we are too busy having fun and checking our respective pulse rates in the process. Made for $30,000,000, the film went on to make $283,200,000 worldwide, those are the sort of figures to make cinema snobs cry in their art laden handkerchiefs.Go Speed ! 9/10",Speed
21,preppy-3,Great action sequences but this movie is incredibly stupid,5,20 December 2009,"LAPD officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and his buddy officer Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) foil the plans of a mad bomber (Dennis Hopper) to hold a bunch of people hostage for millions of dollars. In retaliation he sets up a bus that if it goes under 50 MPH it will blow up and kill all the people on board. Naturally Jack gets on the bus and with the help of spunky Annie Parker (Sandra Bullock) tries to deal with the situation.OK--this movie is REALLY stupid. It has an incredibly dumb plot full of implausible situations and jaw-dropping coincidences. Add to that stupid dialogue, one-dimensional characters, a totally unbelievable (and unnecessary) romance between Bullock and Reeves and truly terrible ""comic"" relief and you got one horrendous movie. However this film does have absolutely astounding action sequences. They're loud, realistic and shot so you're right there with them. Despite the stupid plot these sequences kept me watching. Reeves gives another wooden performance but he looks great with a buzz cut and all pumped up. This is the film that made Bullock a star and rightfully so. She's just great in a severely underwritten part. Hopper surprisingly is pretty bad in his role. He usually plays these parts to perfection but he seems going on auto pilot here. Daniels barely figures in this. So the action is astounding but the really dumb plot kept working against it. I can only give it a 5.",Speed
22,poolandrews,Enjoyable 90's action flick.,7,26 December 2007,"Speed is set in Los Angeles where disgruntled & bitter ex-bomb squad psycho Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) holds an elevator full of people to ransom, either he gets three million dollars or he blows the emergency brakes but his plan is thwarted almost single handedly by LAPD cop officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves). Afterwards Payne feels even more bitter & angry so decides to play a deadly game with Jack, he tells Jack that he has placed a bomb on an LA bus & when the bus goes over 50mph the bomb will arm & if the bus falls below 50mph it will explode killing everyone on board. Jack risks his life to board the speeding bus to warn the driver & passengers, unfortunately the bus has already reached over 50mph, a way to disarm the bomb must be found or pay Payne his three point seven million dollar ransom...Directed by Jan de Bont this is a highly enjoyable fast paced action thriller from the 90's the likes of which they don't seem to make anymore. The script by Graham Yost was apparently rewrote by script doctor Joss Whedon who went uncredited & is an action packed adventure film that is very entertaining although is rather silly at times. The idea behind the film is great, I mean we all love a good car chase & Speed's plot basically gives us an entire film based around vehicular mayhem which is no bad thing. The thing moves along like a rocket, at over 110 minutes in length it certainly doesn't feel that long & it's hard not to like a film which is so single minded in trying to provide plenty of action, thrills & excitement for it's audience. I liked it & I think most people will like it, I certainly think most 90's action film junkies will love it. The character's are just about given enough development to bring them to life although I'd have liked a bit more motivation & explanation behind Payne's actions as it's said he was pensioned off & that's his whole reason for the bombings. Sure some of it was pretty silly & very far fetched but what the hell when a films this downright fun & entertaining who really cares?Director de Bont does alright, he certainly keeps the pace going & there are numerous memorable set-piece action scenes from the speeding bus dodging it's way through the LA traffic to a fight on top of a speeding train to exploding planes to a taught hostage situation at the start. I do have to say that while it's well made there's not much style & the opening credit sequence is maybe the most repetitive & boring I've ever seen in a big budget Hollywood film. There are some continuity issues here, the amount of times the bus hits something head on (smashing that cars door off, hitting the other car up the tow truck ramp & hitting other various sign posts & parked cars) without sustaining any visible damage is stretching things a bit, I mean there isn't even a scratch on it for the first half. It's also nice to watch a film where the majority of the stunts & action was filmed live rather than created using CGI computer effects like most films these days do. The actual violence levels are low & the body count kept to an absolute minimum which is a surprise.With a supposed budget of about $28,000,000 Speed didn't have as big a budget as I had originally thought, maybe they were allowed to film on that unopened freeway for free? Apparently Speed ran out of money during it's production & the subway sequence at the end hadn't been filmed but after good preview screenings (with the subway scene present as storyboards) the studio stumped up the cash to finish it. The acting is alright from a decent cast, Keanu Reeves is OK but doesn't have much presence & Sandra Bullock in her breakthrough role fares much better & comes across as more likable, Dennis Hopper is good as the villain but then he's a great actor anyway so it's expected.Speed is one one of those great macho big budget action thrillers from the 90's with huge amounts of mindless carnage & mayhem that are so enjoyable, it's a bit more silly than usual as well especially the ridiculous jump across an incomplete freeway which is as far fetched as they come. Followed by Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997) which has seemingly killed the franchise.",Speed

24,Boba_Fett1138,Never really understood its appeal.,6,26 December 2007,"It's not that I hate this movie, it's just an average one at best. It's an action movie with only small action moments at times and a story that is too simple and restrained due to its main setting; a bus.I do admit that the movie deserves credit for its concept. I mean, this is obviously not the most expensive action movie of the '90's but due to its concept the movie at all times has a good fast pace and knows to provide the movie with action moments, though I never have really been impressed with the action in this movie. I think this has to do with the fact that the action tries to impress too much. You know, it's the sort of action movie that shows an explosion and big jump from 3 different angles and all in slow-motion as well. This is a style that was frequently used in '80's and '90's genre movies. I just never have been a big fan of this, with some exceptions to this here and there.It was pretty nice to see Hollywood veteran Dennis Hopper as the main villain of the movie. It also was the movie that put him really back on the map for a while. This is also the movie that really launched Keanu Reeves' and Sandra Bullock's careers and as well that of director's Jan de Bont, who made his directorial debut with this movie. I also have the feeling that the former cinematographer is still working in Hollywood as a director due to the success of this movie. Because let's face it, all of his other directed movies were below average, with the exception of ""Twister"", though I seem to be one of the few that actually loved that film.At some moments you can also really tell that this is de Bont's directorial debut. There are some typical beginner's clumsiness's and mistakes. I mean, just look at the goof section here on IMDb for this movie. It's like a never ending list! Just compare this to any other random movie on here. Some of the goofs are obviously more obvious than others in the movie but the goofs that are obvious are also really silly and clumsy one's, which mainly has to do with continuity.The movie is for most part set on a bus, which is both it's strongest and weakest point. Strong because it keeps the movie fast paced as I had previously mentioned before and weak because it really restrains the movie in its story. I mean, let's face it, the story isn't exactly the best or most clever one ever written, even though the concept of it is still good and original. Because the movie is mostly set on a bus also the other scene's around it which are not set in the bus, and I'm also including the beginning and ending of the movie, feel quite out of context with the rest of the movie. It makes this also a fairly disjointed movie to watch. Especially the ending doesn't seem fitting. It feels like the sort of ending that was filmed shortly after a failed test-screening with an alternative ending. I feel that the movie would had been better off if it actually did ended on the bus instead of having this whole subway ending.It's definitely a watchable movie, though by no means the must-see everyone makes this movie out to be.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Speed
25,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Action at a high pace; in fact, almost overwhelmingly high",6,16 October 2006,"Ah, the ""die hard"" scenario. Since the movie of the same title came out in '88, many directors have tried to recreate the tension and energy of the classic action film. The great idea of an location packed with innocent people that's been taken over by a villain(or a group of them), and a single good guy in the same place... the only chance of bringing the explosive situation to a reasonably good end. This film was an attempt at re-capturing that, and at making Keanu Reeves an action-star in the process. I'd say they succeeded more at the second... The Matrix Trilogy speaks in favor of that, I'd say. The plot is fair. The basic idea is actually pretty good. The pacing is intense... the movie hardly ever lets you take a breather. In fact, it almost reaches extreme amounts... becoming overwhelming, leaving the viewer exhausted rather than entertained. The acting is decent enough. The characters aren't terribly developed or fleshed out. The action is pretty cool, and well-filmed and edited. The clichés are sadly present; the cackling(!) villain, the damsel in distress who screeches more than the bus tires and the heroic (male) lead. The dialog has its moments, but much of it sounds too much like trying to be macho and cool. The one-liners vary, but it's hard to deny that the whole ""pop quiz"" bit is cool. All in all, a pretty cool(if overwhelming) action film that just doesn't really break any new ground. I recommend this to any fan of action, the actors involved and anyone interested in the basic idea. Just know that you may find yourself more exhausted than entertained by the end of it. 6/10",Speed
26,view_and_review,L.A. traffic has never been so good,7,10 August 2020,"""Speed"" was so much better 26 years ago. Not that it's bad now, it's just that I don't have the same tolerance I had that long ago. Now, with hundreds of action movies under my belt, I can't just watch the Hollywood fakery and roll with it like it's normal. I'm compelled to point it out and I can't help but be at least a little annoyed.And let's be honest: the Sandra Bullock character, Annie, would be called ""Karen"" today. Allow me to describe the Karen scenario.LAPD bomb specialist and all around supercop, Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves), boarded a bus moving 50 mph in a most death defying manner. Before he can even address the passengers Annie stands up to demand answers from this new passenger as if he had a manager she could complain to should he not have given her the proper answers. It was so absurd. This dude just boarded a moving bus, he's either a criminal, a cop, or a psychopath--in any case, I don't think he's a guy you should be confronting at that time to voice your disapproval of him not paying bus fare (or whatever her complaint was).Like I said, my tolerance nowadays is a lot less. Maybe it's COVID, maybe it's my age, or maybe it's Hollywood. The movie was fairly exciting, anxious, and enjoyable. It was action packed for sure, even if there's no way possible a bus can sustain 50 mph for more than 30 seconds in Los Angeles.",Speed
27,evanston_dad,One Bus That Doesn't Make Any of Its Stops,7,17 March 2009,"Keanu Reeves has the uncanny ability to pop up in a legitimately good movie just often enough to keep people convinced that he may not be a completely worthless actor after all. ""Speed"" became a big hit in 1994 against all expectations. It was meant to be a disposable genre film and instead became a blockbuster.It's the ultimate high-concept movie: a bus will blow up if it's not kept moving above a certain speed. You can imagine the results. Reeves is fine, as is Dennis Hopper, hamming it up as the villain, but the reason for the film's success is mostly due to Sandra Bullock (this may have been her debut?) as the plucky bus driver. Bullock is such a pleasing presence on film that even if the movie around her sucks, you keep watching just for her. Fortunately for us, the movie around her is pretty good too.Grade: A-",Speed
28,Uriah43,Unrealistic Excitement,6,15 October 2020,"This film essentially begins with a psychotic bomber by the name of ""Howard Payne"" (Dennis Hopper) planting a couple of explosives on one the elevators of a skyscraper in downtown Los Angeles. When the first one explodes it traps a number of people on the elevator between floors at least 40 stories up. He then calls the Los Angeles police department and demands a ransom of $3 million in exchange for not severing the remaining cable holding the elevator in place. What he doesn't know is that two police officers by the names of ""Jack Traven"" (Keanu Reeves) and his partner ""Harry"" (Jeff Daniels) have already worked their way up to the elevator and have prepared an emergency workaround which subsequently allows them to evacuate all of those trapped inside. Needless to say, this infuriates Howard who then devises an even more deadly plan with Jack as an unwitting liaison between him and the LAPD. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, although there were several scenes that completely defied reality, the film turned out to be quite entertaining with both Keanu Reeves and Dennis Hopper performing their roles in an exceptional manner. Likewise, Sandra Bullock (as ""Annie"") also performed quite well. That said, although it certainly had its faults, I found this to be an enjoyable film for the most part and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",Speed

This is only an issue for me though cause if you like Bullock you will not mind her as much, as for me I do not care for her and I definitely was not going to see Speed 2 with her being the lead character. Here we have a guy trying to secure some funds by holding an elevator full of people hostage. His plans are foiled by to plucky members of the police force and he is seemingly killed. However, this turns out not to be the case as our mad bomber is still at large and he rigs a bus to explode if the bus goes under 55 mph hence the title of the movie. Granted, it is a stupid way to try and hold people ransom because if Reeves' character does not get to the bus on time it would have simply exploded, but hey it is just a movie. Lots of action ensues and a bit to much whiny Bullock for my tastes, but I roll with it.

The camera work, the pacing, it's just an amusement park ride when you get right down to it.On a different note, it's also one of my favorite Keanu Reeves movies. The role just seems to suit him.

I have to say that normally a Keanu Reeves movie is only sometimes enjoyable to watch, but this was a very exciting action movie, in fact one of the best I've seen. I know that it was very over the top and a little silly, but it was just so much fun to watch.Keanu plays Jack, a police officer who has just foiled another crime by EVIL mastermind Dennis Hopper.

Who'd'a thought it?",9,3 December 2003,"You're going to say one thing after watching ""Speed,"" and that will be ""Whoa."" This is an action film as exhausting as ""Die Hard"" and as exhilarating as the ""Terminator"" movies. It moves with the pacing of a John McTiernan picture and it has the perfection of a James Cameron action film. Its director, Jan De Bont, has worked on such films as ""Die Hard"" and ""The Hunt for Red October,"" so it's no surprise that he bears a resemblance behind the camera to McTiernan. The film is blunt, fast-paced and extremely exciting. It stars Keanu Reeves as Jack Traven, a Los Angeles bomb squad member as cool as he is decisive. Jack has been called into duty, along with his partner and friend, Harry (Jeff Daniels), to stop a madman bomber (Dennis Hopper), who has taken control of an elevator and will drop it to the ground unless his demand of three million dollars is met. Jack takes his chances and ends up saving the day, but not before Harry is taken hostage and survives with a bullet shot. Howard Payne (Hopper) is dead, blown to pieces by his own bomb, and so they all go have a drink and party till the moon goes down and the sun rises up. You get the idea. But Payne didn't really die, and now he's very mad at a certain somebody who foiled his last plan. He's spent a lifetime being treated as dirt, and he has convinced himself that he deserves the $3 million more than anybody else. Jack begs to differ, but he has no time to argue when Payne reappears and triggers a downtown bus with a bomb. The catch? If the bus accelerates past 50 M.P.H. and then drops below that point as before...kaboom.>Jack manages to board the bus, but not before it reaches 50, and not before the bus driver gets shot by a criminal on the bus and Annie (Sandra Bullock) has to play driver for the rest of the day. The problem is, downtown LA during rush hour is not exactly open to a large bus, so with the help of the LAPD, the bus is driven to a deserted stretch of highway, where they have a limited amount of time to either disarm the bus or pay up the sum of money to Payne. Meanwhile, Howard Payne is monitoring everything from his position in an apartment in LA, where he has a gadget wired up to the security camera in the bus, so that he can watch everything that's happening. If anyone tries to get off the bus, or if anyone tries to be a hero, he presses a little red button and.kaboom. Only this time, he's determined not to fail. This is a ludicrously and ridiculously delicious plot. I'm surprised it hasn't been done already. Well, actually, it sorta has. Yes, this film bears an uncanny resemblance to ""Die Hard,"" only on a bus, but you know what? It's just about as good. It's exciting, humorous, and absolutely fun from start to finish. It never stops to go into boring conversations back at the FBI headquarters that so many action films do to try and make them look smarter. It never lets up for a moment once it starts. All good action films have comedic relief, and ""Speed"" - apart from occasional witty remarks between Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves and/or Dennis Hopper - has Alan Ruck and Jeff Daniels. You may remember Ruck as Cameron Frye in John Hughes' ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" (1986), and you may remember him from the television show ""Spin City,"" and here he plays a tourist who isn't really able to understand the situation they're in on the bus. ""The airport?"" he says as the bus swerves down a runway. ""I've already been here."" Daniels is one of cinema's great character actors with dry subtle humor. He can do dramatics (""Gettysburg""), he can do comedy (""Dumb and Dumber""), and he can now do action. It takes an odd sort of acting genius to subtly upstage Jim Carrey, but he did just that in ""Dumb and Dumber"" by making a subtle goofball out of his character, Harry Dunne. Here he does the same with the sort of bleak sarcastic quips he was born to say. Jan De Bont knows how to film action. Just when you think everything's going to slow down after the bus finally stops, we realize it's just the beginning. Payne kidnaps Annie, takes her to a subway train, and tries to run away with her to lure Jack. It works. And in the climatic gripper, Jack and Payne fight on the top of a speeding subway train. It was done in ""Mission: Impossible"" a small number of years later, but this came first. And the film is better. Can Keanu Reeves act? Hardly. He does his usual ""Whoa"" routine here, where his lines primarily consist of long pauses and, ""Huh?"" ""What?"" ""Whoa,"" ""Wow,"" ""F--k me,"" ""Bogus,"" and so on. But an action film doesn't need a good actor, and Reeves fits the part. It was his breakthrough action role - without it, he never would have appeared in ""The Matrix."" ""Speed"" is one of the great action films. It bears similarities to ""Die Hard,"" ""Lethal Weapon,"" ""RoboCop,"" ""Total Recall,"" ""The Terminator"" (1 and 2), ""Predator,"" and all those other hard-punching action films with a fast pace and a real kick (it doesn't bear resemblance to all of the films as much as the raw force behind them). You know the kind of hard action flicks I mean - the kind that make you feel beaten up by the time it's all over. The kinds that make you leave the theater bruised and swollen.

Anyways after his first scheme he decides to rig a bus with passengers with a bomb and the bus has to go over 50 miles an hour for it not to blow up with innocent lives. And it's up to Officer Jack Traven and the police force to stop the guy. Overall this is a good solid fun popcorn flick from the 90's.

42,OllieSuave-007,Need for speed!,9,7 December 2013,"""Speed"" is a very entertaining movie, about cop Officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) who must prevent a bomb from exploding on a city bus by keeping its speed above 50 mph. Dennis Hopper gave a very ruthless performance as terrorist Howard Payne and Sandra Bullock gave a touching and stirring performance as Annie Porter.The action and urgency gets right to the point from beginning to end, giving this entire movie an edge-of-your-seat ride, which would surely keep the audience glued to the screen.Every scene inside the bus gives a heart-pounding experience, letting us wonder what would happen to the people inside and what plan Traven have up his sleeves to save them before the bus explodes or runs out of gas. The subplot involving Traven's fellow officer colleague Detective Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) investigating the whereabouts of Payne is also intriguing. The end battle was a little rushed, but it's a minor problem.Overall, a very exciting movie from start to finish with no-nonsense stuff and no boring dramatic fillers - just pure action and adventure!Grade A-",Speed
43,thesar-2,Need for (only 1) Speed,8,28 September 2013,"Hard to believe it's nearing 20 years since they released Speed. And it, pretty much, still holds up today.This was just one of the long lines of very good to great movies that starred and was certainly not helped by: Keanu Reeves. At the time, he was the luckiest man in Hollywood, from Bram Stoker's Dracula to Speed to The Matrix. He got to be in the cream of the crop without having to show any depth or acting ability. Perhaps, that's what director Jan de Bont was looking for here: a soulless and cardboard cop and well, there you go.Actually, the real star here was Sandra Bullock and this was her break-through role. She stole every scene, had the best lines and timing and looked stunning. Hell, even Dennis Hopper's juicy and fun Howard ""anything but a"" Payne was no match for Bullock. So, if you forget the forgettable Jeff Daniels and Joe Morton and, naturally, whiteout Reeves, the true stars were Bullock and Hopper.They were so good, that even with the great amount of enormously enjoyable action, it's worth seeing just for them two.Speed focuses on disgruntled Payne and when his terrorist plot of bombing an elevator – too bad he didn't pick the one from the terrible Devil movie – is thwarted by the cops (Reeves's Jack Traven and Daniels's Harry Temple,) Payne shifts to road wars. He rigs a bus that, once it hits 50 mph, it will explode if it slows below 50 mph. Luckily, for everyone on this LA bus, when the bus does hit 50 mph, it's navigated by shrewd, albeit rightfully scared, passenger Annie Porter and Traven, who happened to ""catch the bus.""There are rules, of course – this is a 90s terrorist action flick, duh. No one can get off the bus, and Payne wants money for an undisclosed and anti-spoiler reason, or he'll blow the bus. Annie must pilot this bus through the already terrible LA traffic while the stiff, er, Jack figures out what to do.Since the years, and now almost decades, since this came out, this movie's been dissected enough. Sure, there are huge plot holes, some even big enough to drive (or leap) said bus through – even at 50 mph, but if you sit back, leave your brain at the door, you can enjoy the ride. It's campy 90s action fare, and for those of us who loved it back then and still do, this is the movie for us.I will say, I do have one huge problem with this. Okay, maybe not the original, but the sequel. STAY AWAY FROM (anything but) Speed 2: Cruise Control. That movie was a tragedy from beginning to end. And this kind of movie did NOT need a sequel. It was great as it was. Just have fun here and don't take the next bus.",Speed
44,FeastMode,my notes,7,26 June 2019,Great fun and intense movie. really awesome idea for the premise. taken in all the right directions. definitely a few dumb things and Keanu Reeves's acting was pretty horrible at times but still entertaining overall. good music I liked the villain a lot too (3 viewings),Speed
45,Robert_duder,Hands down one of the best action films in existence,9,14 January 2012,"I can review Speed very easily. It defines riveting, edge of your seat, pulse pounding, action packed, breathless action. The concept is just brilliant and the first time I saw Speed many years ago I remember barely being able to sit on my seat let alone be on the edge of it. It just takes you away, knocks it out of the park and keeps you riveted for the entire run time. Is it perfect? No. It actually has a ton of flaws when you start to dissect it but the film making is so good, the concept so captivating that you forget and ignore everything that is silly about it. A great action movie should be able to make you suspend reality and believe every word and scene they show you. Speed will make you ignore how ridiculous it is that they jump a full sized city bus across a gaping hole in an overpass and instead you will stand up, cheer and root for that scene. Some of the film is honestly bordering on cheesy and it just doesn't matter one lick because this is the most adrenaline packed, thrill ride you will ever lay your eyes on.90's Movie star Keanu Reeves was probably the perfect choice for this film. He has the star power and the clout and the chemistry to pull off being the hero of this movie. No one could have done it better. That being said Reeves has a particular style to him that is inherently cheesy. When I watched Speed again and again I found myself laughing more at his performance but it doesn't change the fact that he is the star and carries the movie just fine. Sandra Bullock is fantastic in her role as Annie. Annie is fun and wild and clumsy and just a great female hero. Her and Reeves actually have great chemistry and Bullock fans will absolutely love this performance. Dennis Hopper is deliciously evil as Howard Payne (what a great bad guy name), and like Reeves has a certain B-Movie quality to his character but does it so well and the cat and mouse between him and Reeves is perfect. Jeff Daniels plays Reeves partner and does a good job. The only issue with him is that I wish they had used him more in the story. I wish I could mention all of the supporting cast because they are all really good in their roles especially the other passengers on the bus.I don't think director Jan de Bont has done anything since this film that even touches how great this genre film was. By nature he is a cinematographer and I think that's interesting because this film is stunning to watch. Every shot, every scene, the pace and style of the movie is just brilliant. I can't express enough that this is THEE quintessential action flick. This is the sort of action flick you could watch again and again and still be thrilled by it every time because it is literally non-stop action from beginning to end. I rarely mention music when it comes to films but the music in Speed stays with you with this thumping beat and a great soundtrack. If you haven't seen Speed...you're missing out...because it defines action and you can find few films even close to being better. 9.5/10",Speed
46,ElMaruecan82,The cinematic shot of adrenalin that resurrected an agonizing action movie gimmick...,10,26 January 2016,"The 70's had ""Jaws"", the 80's had ""Die Hard"" and the 90's had ""Speed"". What do all these movies have in common? An irresistible and unmistakable high concept: a uniqueness in the plot allowing other movies to be summarized by simple combinations, like ""Alien"" is ""Jaws"" in space, and ""Under Siege "" is ""Die Hard"" in a boat. It's by the way an odd coincidence that the director of ""Speed"", the unknown Jan de Bont was the cinematographer of ""Die Hard"", he sure learned in the best school.So, ""Speed"" relies on a simple concept: a bus can't slow down under 50 mph, otherwise, it explodes. Let me take a few lines because the wannabe screenwriter I am can't resist to the temptation of exalting such a high high-concept. I think, it's the kind of ideas that are worth at least half the work, I mean, imagine a producer being submitted such a project, how many spectacular premises does that hold? How about a traffic jam? What if a road comes to a dead end? How can the passengers leave the bus? How can they disarm the bomb? How can the villain make sure they can't take the passengers out? How will they be able to fool the villain anyway? etc. etc.Movies based on ""what if"" situations are generally the best in the way they make you wonder what can happen next while you're already enjoying the present action, the enjoyment is doubled, and through a bus that can't go down 50 pm, everything is meant to happen fast, to put you on a constant edge. It was a no-fail guarantee and all ""Speed"" had to deliver were the requirements of the action genre, and get us a memorable movie villain, Dennis Hopper is perfect as the young and maniac bomb expert Howard Payne, a cool hero, Keanu Reeves, a then relatively new face of action movies and a young Sandra Bullock who has this mixture of inner heroism and genuine fear, something our female-power driven era would deem as sexist (God I miss the 90's!).There is also Jeff Daniels as the more experienced cop, a script full of funny archetypal one- liners, and more than anything, a terrific plot structure. ""Speed"" actually, could have only consisted on a bus chase and it would have worked, but it spices up the material and pushes the envelope of the action genre by introducing two other spectacular sequences, one introducing the villain, who installs a bomb within the cables of an elevator and threatens to make a dozen of innocent people fall to their death, and the climax that can simply be summed up as ""Speed"" in a subway. I used to think that this was unnecessary, but when you think about it, ""Speed"" doesn't just overplay the action card, it also bases itself on a simple third-act structure: introduce the villain, then the meat of the story, the heart-pounding bus ride and then the ultimate confrontation.""Speed"" is like a great shot of adrenaline revisiting what was an agonizing action movie gimmick: the obligatory car chase. It would also inspire a less successful sequel with ""Speed 2: Under Control"", and I think it's a bit unfair to dismiss the whole movie, it didn't work because it didn't have ambition but because the original had too much of it, so it inevitably paled by comparison. 1994 was a terrific year for movies and it's all the more fitting to have a groundbreaking movie in the action genre.That was a quick review, but if there's one thing I learned from ""Speed"" is that sometimes, the faster, the better.",Speed
47,paul2001sw-1,Thick and fast,6,27 December 2006,"Celebrated thriller 'Speed' actually features three separate ""thrills"" in one film; the opening section, set in a lift shaft, is my favourite, and the famous bus-that-musn't slow down scenario occupies only the middle segment. The cast includes Dennis Hopper, playing to type as the psychopathic mastermind behind all the action. It's all idiotically silly, of course, and most of the individual stunts could have been done better (for example, when the bus jumps a whole in the freeway, we don't get a shot of the complete move), but director Jan da Bont keeps the action coming at a furious pace.

48,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Barely lets its foot off the gas for a second.,8,1 April 2018,"'Speed (1994)' gets straight into the action and barely lets its foot off the gas for a second, barrelling straight ahead with full force and gusto without stopping for a moment to let you catch your breath. It's an extremely fun, exciting and thrilling adventure that's wonderfully tangible and is sure to keep you on the edge-of-your-seat throughout. Sure, the third act seems out of place and like an unnecessary repeat of what came before, the flick is occasionally a little too cheesy for its own good, Dennis Hopper sometimes gets a bit too hammy and Keanu Reaves, ever so often, shows just how far his acting talent has come since 1994, but this is an incredibly entertaining, wholly engaging and breathlessly exciting action-thriller that takes its relatively simple, slightly 'Die Hard (1988)' like premise and does wonders with it. It really is a fantastic, frenetic blast throughout; certainly one of the best pictures of its kind. 8/10.",Speed

50,bowmanblue,Pop quiz: what's the best action movie of the nineties?,10,27 January 2015,"Answer: Speed. I just watched it again, now twenty-one years after I first saw it in the cinema. There are few movies that can be considered 'timeless' and, although 'Speed' may be an unlikely name to be added to that list, I truly believe it deserves its place among the 'action greats.' Even though it was filmed in the nineties, it looks as good today as it ever did. Okay, so the absence of iphones and Twitter may be noticeable, but it could basically be set today and you wouldn't really notice. The special effects are perfect and blend seamlessly with the action (no dodgy computer generated armies of monsters of far away planets to distract you and pull you out of the moment).Yes, it's definitely an 'action' movie (okay, there's a beautifully-woven romance element in there, but it's not central to the overall story). And, normally when I watch a blatant all out action film, I assume that the – primary – audience would be the lads. However, Speed is actually a film that's so good it's probably quite watchable even if you're not really into explosions and car chases.Speed's primary selling point is its simplicity. The story is hardly complicated and yet so original that it's amazing that it's never been done before. A mad bomber places an explosive device on a Los Angeles passenger bus and, if it slows down to less than fifty miles an hour, the bomb detonates. That's pretty much it for the majority of the film – the bus ride. And it's a hell of a ride to say the least.And then there's the cast. Poor ol' Keanu Reeves sometimes get a little flack for his acting abilities. However, he's on top form here as the no-nonsense cop who's determined to save the passengers and bring down the bomber at the same time. I always remember one of the reasons 'Die Hard' is also regarded as a classic action film – because the relationship between the hero and the villain is at the forefront of the story. Here, we have Dennis Hopper as the bomber who's always one step ahead of the police. Thanks to mobile phones he's in constant contact with Keanu, reminding him how the police are going to fail. Of course it wouldn't be complete without the obligatory 'love interest.' Granted Sandra Bullock was sort of well-known from Demolition Man the year before this, but Speed was definitely her break-through performance.Like I said, Speed is timeless and one of the most accessible, watchable movies ever made in its genre. It really does have everything you could ever want if you're looking for an all out thrill-ride – it's primarily fast, but also contains moments of genuine heart and sadness (let's just say the path of the righteous doesn't always run smoothly). It's just a shame that lightning obviously wasn't able to strike twice (and by that I'm talking about the – sadly – inferior 'Speed 2').",Speed
51,g-bodyl,Fun Action Movie!,9,21 August 2012,"Speed is another great action film that came out in the 1980's and 1990's. I think this film had the best villain though. Dennis Hopper's character was creepy and sadistic. This film has everything an action fan can hope for. It has great action, cool stunts, and some lovely romance.This film is about an LAPD cop who must try to save the day when a bus in armed with a bomb and if it goes slower than fifty miles per hour, it will explode.This is one of Keanu Reeve's better performances. He does better here than he did in the Matrix movies. Sandra Bullock does a good job in her role. But I really enjoyed Dennis Hopper as the villain with many tricks up his sleeves.Overall, this is one fun action film. It gave me enough adrenaline to keep me focused for the whole film. There are many cool stunts, sets, and special effects. I rate this film 9/10.",Speed

53,CuriosityKilledShawn,Just blow up already!,5,5 March 2012,"For some reason Speed seems to be above criticism. It doesn't deserve this regard. I've never liked this film, and for a long list of reasons. I remember clearly the summer of 1994 when it became a sleeper hit. 'Die Hard on a bus' they called it. Erm...no. More like 'The Poseidon Adventure on a bus'.Everybody knows the story by now, which is the sign of a high-concept idea. But I'm not captured by it. A bomb threat on a yuppie elevator ends with the bomber apparently blowing himself up in the parking lot. The LAPD cannot allow the yuppies to fall a breathtaking one-foot per second into the basement (it honestly moves at this 'speed' with none of them affected by zero-gravity). The bomber claims he invested 3 years into this plan, but overnight he conjures-up a better plan (all with just a single oppose-able thumb) in which a bus will blow up if it falls below 50 mph.Half-witted cop Jack Traven races to the rescue. But instead of blowing-out the bus's tires he simply yells at the driver to stop. He doesn't. Once on-board they barge through traffic jams, hard corners, magically jump over 50-foot gaps (launched by invisible ramps it seems), and argue among themselves. The passengers are an undynamic bunch of cardboard cut-outs (burly worker in hat, long-faced African woman, whiny old crone, unemployed bachelor, geeky tourist) who never once get our sympathies. Many of them don't even have any dialogue and just sit there as if the threat of being blown to smithereens is a daily occurrence. Also, if I were Jack Traven, I'd put a bullet in the head of that annoying Helen before she even got a chance to draw air into her lungs in order to make her first complaint.Directed by former cinematographer Jan De Bont (who is actually responsible for making Die Hard look as good as it does), it's a high-key movie (to the point of almost being sterile) with lots of destruction and well-choreographed action, but he has no idea how to direct actors or build character. Between the action scenes there are painful lulls which are not helped by the frequently awful dialogue and poor writing.Perhaps I should say poor re-writing. Though Graham Yost is the only credited writer the script was significantly re-written by Joss Whedon, who made many changes. Originally the bomber was revealed to be Jeff Daniels' character, but after Whedon created Howard Payne the character of Harry Temple became redundant by the end of the second act and he's needlessly killed off. Other elements of the original draft are fossilized into the story and give it an irregular flow. There are so many other contrivances and lazy explanations that I just can't forgive. Jack Traven realizes that there is a camera on the bus when Payne refers to Sandra Bullock as 'the wildcat', despite the fact that the ancient camera Payne has hooked up inside the vehicle has nowhere near enough resolution to make out the Wildcat logo on her jacket (which she is also leaning against).Keanu Reeves' acting is so bad it makes Seagal look like Olivier. Don't get me wrong, I like Keanu, but he's excruciatingly awful in this film. His puzzling facial expressions and just plain bizarre pronunciation of certain words gives Jack Traven (already an unlikeable character) a semi-retarded edge. I longed for Payne to get away with it.Apparently Vic Armstrong was up for directing this but the producers went for Jan De Bont because of his lengthy camera credits. The success of the film is purely down to star power and its high concept. It's nothing to do with De Bont's ability as a director (which is why he hasn't worked since 2003) and I know that Armstrong would have made a better movie, even if he was stuck with Keanu (who he worked with a year later on notorious flop Johnny Mnemonic ), who couldn't even act ill if he had the flu.Speed is not a good film. It's a badly-written early 90s relic. I just cannot even begin to understand the adoration its gathered over the years.",Speed

While rather bereft of intellectual philosophizing, this action-thriller keeps its cool and avoids the over the top, crazy antics sufficiently to make this movie almost believable (except for perhaps an impossible freeway-bus ride that from the way it was shot truly impossible). This movie comes close to the typical stereotypical characters but in some way the director underplayed such characters slightly...the convict, the tourist, the scared passenger all seem to be one-dimensional, yet were never flaunted for exploitation. This movie remains timeless, gripping, captivating in this tight script points and the special effect explosions spectacular yet aesthetically within real world boundaries. The balance of drama, insight, with dollops of humor are nicely blended together to make a rounded movie that can connect with the average viewer.

59,The-Sarkologist,"Actually, I found this movie really boring",2,6 December 2013,"I heard a lot of hype about this movie when it was on the big screen and a lot of people seemed to like it and say good things about it. I never got around to seeing it on the big screen, and was not too keen on seeing it considering Sandra Bullock's quote: let's have a relationship based purely upon sex. That seriously put me off seeing the movie, but I watched it when my sister hired it and my opinion was that it was dull.Speed is supposed to be an action movie with suspense that leaves you on the edge of your seat. The best part of the movie is when the bus smashes through a pram but after that the rest of the movie is simply too predictable. The events in the movie are not constructed in a way that makes you wonder what is going to happen. We expect everything to be all right, and of course it is. There is one scene where the bus has to jump a gap in the freeway, and it is a very wide gap. We know that the bus is going to make it because there is no other way of solving the situation without killing a majority of the people on board the bus (which would end up defeating the purpose of the film) An ex-bomb squad officer is disillusioned at the measly pension that he received after retiring so he decides that he will use his knowledge of bombs to get himself a lot of money. He plans an elevator bomb but his plan is foiled by the LAPD, and namely one particular officer played by Keanu Reeves. Angered at his failure, he wires more bombs to buses, one which explodes as a warning. The second is wired to a bus that arms when the bus exceeds fifty miles per hours and explodes when it drops below fifty kilometers an hour. He has a network of cameras to keep an eye on everything to make sure his plans are going okay.There are a lot of faults in the movie. Like how can a crane that is designed to lift heavy weights cannot hold up an elevator full of people. Then the bigger hole is that this man has a measly pension yet he seems to not only have access to very specific explosives, but he also has the money to be able to afford some extremely advanced equipment. Being bomb squad, he has the knowledge to rig bombs, but it seems that he should not have the money.Speed also raises some interesting issues, but puts them across badly. What we have in this movie is the fact that police officers are putting their lives on the line constantly yet are being paid very little. Whether this is true or not I don't know (I have since discovered that it is not actually true), but if this is an issue the movie brings it out in a very bad way. Basically it is telling us to shut up and put up with the problems in our society because there is no way to solve them. Basically if we try to solve them, usually through violence, then we are bound to fail. In another way this is also an anti-terrorist film, trying to put the message across to all us would be terrorists to warn us away from using violent methods to solve our problems, because even the grandest of schemes is doomed to failure.",Speed

Starring Keanu Reeves, in one of his biggest roles, and a lesser known Sandra Bullock, this film delivers in terms of action, suspense and overall excitement. With likable leads, great stunts, not forced romance and an entertaining and not completely over the top villain, we can see as to why Speed is as high praised as it is.Watching for the first time this year, this film doesn't feel as outdated as many other great or classic films of the 1990's.

Yeah, its dramatic and action packed but the movie is another example of what Hollowood was thinking during this era of movies.The casting is fine. I thought the characters were believable but poor Dennis Hopper got the shaft with a really dumpy character who was poorly written in to the script.My biggest problem is the whole premise of not going below a certain speed. I mean seriously, have you ever driven in LA? It isn't going to happen. And if you were a disgruntled employee who got shafted from not getting their pension, I could think of plenty of other targets to get your money. The entire process is so convoluted and needlessly drawn out that you know the guy is going to get either caught or killed at the end.And where is this guy getting the connectivity for a remote camera in 1994?

68,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Situational action classic with relentless suspense that cures all ills,7,28 February 2010,"Any good film, book, essay or song has a grabber that catches your attention and hooks you through the rest of that work. ""Speed"" is a two-hour grabber. It is the consummate thrill-a- minute movie, the kind where all sins of bad acting and preposterous events are forgiven because the action and suspense are like a wild concoction of sugar and crack. This action movie will bring out the adrenaline junkie in just about anybody.Far from perfect or even basically intelligent, ""Speed"" is about exciting as movies get. After an ""eccentric"" old man (Dennis Hopper) rigs a crowded elevator with explosives to collect a ransom, two LAPD cops, Jack and Harry (Reeves and Daniels), stop him, but he gets away. Days later, he rigs a public bus with a bomb. Once the bus travels 50 mph the bomb will arm. If it drops below that mark, it will explode. To make things more thrilling, he drags Jack into the crisis.Writer Graham Yost toys with us like a cat with a ball of yarn. Everything that could go wrong does go wrong. Yost hurls all kinds of unforeseeable problems at Jack and the rest of the characters. He must've sat down and made a list entitled ""things that can go wrong when you're on a bus that can't slow down."" It sounds sort of elementary, but it's actually clever. He strings them together effortlessly as if they were dominoes as opposed to separate plot points. Either way, it's better than the alternative of ""how many times they can narrowly escape the inescapable,"" but there's some of that too.Unfortunately, if there were a Razzie for Worst Performance by an Ensemble, ""Speed"" would be up for the award. It doesn't say much for Keanu Reeves when his best quality as an actor is being stoic. If he cried at a real family member's funeral I'd probably think he was faking it. It works for ""Speed"" however because he's the on guy not freaking out and in control -- well, except for one notable three-year-old temper tantrum. Co-star Sandra Bullock in one of her earlier roles is annoying, setting a precedent for much of her career. Even Dennis Hopper takes a bit to become a convincing nutjob. Then again, it's all easily overlooked in a film as breakneck as ""Speed.""Eternally engaging, suspenseful and cleverly constructed, ""Speed"" is a bar-setting action film. No other movie will be able to go near the stay-moving singular vehicle hostage action movie without bringing ""Speed"" to mind. It's a category of its own, a heck of an action cocktail that will leave you punch drunk to the point where just about any line of dialog is a keeper.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",Speed

71,jzappa,"Just the Meat and Potatoes, Please.",10,28 May 2010,"Stripping the action genre to its narrative core, the classic Speed draws equally from the disaster cycle, and is structured upon three extended set pieces in which a falling elevator, a speeding bus and a rushing train fulfill the sensory pleasures suggested in the title. This is what I believe makes Speed such a delightful revisit for us. It's a classic vehicle (pun intended) for a cop riding roughshod (double pun) to foil a scheme, but not inherently about any moral or legal maze, or a vendetta, or good vs. evil. The cops aren't saving the day from the bad guy so much because they're good guys, but because they have the resources and skills to do so. The bad guy himself isn't much more than a blank-slate psychopath and shouldn't be, because the real antagonists are the laws of physics themselves, fifty-storey elevator shafts, the finite nature of a full tank of gas, highways and other sorts of paths that are under construction. Speaking of which, why would a public subway car be on an incomplete track in the first place? So that it can burst through concrete into a street? There aren't detours and shoulders like a bus on an expressway. It would've saved L.A. and 20th Century Fox a few million dollars if Graham Yost's script made more sense. But what makes Speed such an enthusiastically gratifying experience is that it centralizes to the bottom line, inducing the pure effect of causing us to clench up.Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are not exactly thespians known for their versatility. They're movie stars who were young and hot in the 1990s, and played relatively the same characters in various scenarios. But neither are incapable of good performances, and Speed seems to embody the very Californian culture that makes their characterizations lend an everyday charm to these two people. Reeves plays L.A.P.D. SWAT specialist Jack Traven as a sweet, dedicated young guy who likely spends the weekend smoking bongs with his surfer buddies in between saving the lives of every hostage before an elevator is sent plummeting to certain destruction and using commandeered sports cars on Los Angeles freeways as his springboard to jump onto a bus full of people that may explode at any moment. It's a relative enough behavioral variation on the same spaced-out surfer dude/stoner/metalhead he'd been playing, but it gives Jack Traven a fast-sketch exposition, a very endearing one, resulting not in an invincibly tough Republican like McClane or Callahan or Rambo but a more vulnerable and contemporary polite guy pushing the limits of his mental and physical endurance to prevent anyone from being killed. Same with Bullock, who plays essentially the same brassy, inadvertently heroic everyday gal with a warm soul, so putting her Annie, with the convenient revoked license for speeding, in the driver's seat where she is responsible for making the fifty-foot leaps in unfinished road and avoiding pedestrians and other oncoming traffic, we have a character who is put to the test of her own mental and physical endurance as well, in a shorthand fashion by a script that cannot afford to slow down.Now, the script does, nevertheless, interrupt itself when it leaves the speeding bus for five minutes or so at a time so that Harry, Jack's mentor/partner/best friend played by Jeff Daniels---yet another familiar actor installing behavioral abbreviation for a character---can compile clues to identify a culprit of whom we're already aware, as well as to elaborate superfluously on a far-fetched potential motive, or when Jack and Annie fall in love amidst a frantic life-or-death endurance trial that lasts under a day. And frankly, Dennis Hopper's ham-fisted mad-bomber extortionist is shown on-screen too often during the speeding bus situation for him to be as formidable as he could've been. Imagine the script were its blade not dulled by extraneous commercial sensibilities, a Speed that was able to give us the necessary result of the redundant on-screen investigation by Harry, a Speed confident and edgy enough to skip B on the way from A to C. But the acting, or more precisely the casting, is efficient enough to develop character in a way that streamlines the action.Jan de Bont, though by no stretch the most consistent or unique, is yet another overseas filmmaker to have come to Hollywood and pumped it up with new inspiration and energy. All in all, what's more crucial than literal everyday people going about literally everyday routines, suddenly finding themselves in danger of dying by explosion, being pulverized, etc.? What could we care about more? We don't have to care that Martin Riggs misses his wife in Lethal Weapon, that John Rambo doesn't want to kill anymore but does, that Dirty Harry has to work with a female partner. We may like these other movies however much, but these are laughably petty concerns compared to people---cops, crooks, tourists, working stiffs, whatever---who have no choice but to struggle or be blown up. That is why Speed, flaws and all, is in a league of its own above other '80s, '90s actioners.",Speed
72,videorama-759-859391,High movie speedometer,9,9 May 2018,"Going to see this film, was one of thew most cranked up, fuelled adrenaline rides, I've had in a movie theatre. The movie's cranked up on coolness, from the get go. This 94 actioner was a rare treat. Rarely does such an original, and unbelievably exciting film come along. It's much a revenge driven tale, not just judged by Reeve's taste of blood for mad bomber Hopper, but embittered, ex employee- Hopper's reasons for doing what he's doing. Hopper, such a highly underated actor, when you judge his large show of work, again creates a character we love to hate. My half brother had once told me, ""He's the most morbid actor I though"". He's really in his top form here, like he was in Ticker. Of course this film, launched sexy Bullocks career, who unwittingly becomes, Reeve's right hand man on a bus set to explode, if the needle, falls under or goes over 50 miles a hour, and I mean hey, it's that a great intense premise for a movie. Her cast here, couldn't be more perfect. Reeves plays another hotshot here, basically. The excellent script, also explores the workings and stressful environment of bomb disposal guys, when dealing with bombers, who sabotage lifts, as well as sabotage and thwart Hopper's initial plans. 94's Blown Away also did this to a quite, intense and suspenseful degree, but Speed does it more excitingly and smartly, again thanks to Yost's script. There are intensely tragic moments as are intensely suspenseful ones. This is a movie that thrill's and never drops it's pace or intensity factor. The movie doesn't treat the audience like an idiot. It's a very real movie, and not very far at all, from an actual reality. Frightening to think, especially if there's someone out there like Hopper, or his character inspires a real nutter.",Speed

So when the bomber tells Jack that there is a bus that has a bomb underneath the bus, its up to Jack to try and stop it but there is a catch you see. The bus has to go up to 50 and if it slows down or if anyone has to stop the bus,the bus will explode. So the passengers have to try and stay calm and with a young woman on board called Annie(played by the brilliant Bullock)she helps Jack and drives the bus. But will the passengers get off the bus? Will the bomber strike again?Overall SPEED is a brilliant action packed movie that will have you on the edge of your seat.

74,hellraiser7,Maximum Overdrive,10,31 December 2012,"We are dependent everyday on motorized transportation whether it's by car, plane, motorcycle, anything else to get us from point A to B in the least amount of time. However despite these things in working order like with all machines there is that looming possibility that something can go wrong and usually does.This is one of my favorite action films of all time, it's just so thrilling and so much fun. This film has a lot to offer at the quickest amount of time it runs on. The cinematography and effects are great because it's all practical and real. You really do feeling like you moving at high speed. The music score is exciting the theme song is one of my favorite themes of all time, and this score may have been a partial inspiration for the score in the video game franchise ""Metal Gear Solid"".The characters are really good: Howard Payne by the late great Dennis Hopper is a good opponent, he's a villain you love to hate. His character is a smart greedy psychopath who is menacing, a short fuse when things don't go his way, and he's got some charisma so he's got some really good lines.Protagonists are also good from the main one Jack Traven played well by Keanu Reeves, he's tough, knows how to keep his cool and be in control of an out of control situation, smart, and also has charisma he has some good lines as well as humorous moments like unintentionally giving a guy I call the Tuneman some grief.Annie Porter played by one of my favorite actresses Sandra Bullock whom I think is hot and has the persona to boot. She feisty, funny, witty, has some fire in her, she can also handle herself under pressure, has driving skills which are obviously useful, she should of been a race car driver.Even a few of the passengers and two people that help them Harry Temple (Jeff Danniels) and Capt. McMahon (Joe Morton from the TV show ""Eureka"") are also really good, contribute and have their moments and good lines. This is part of what makes the suspense of the film work is actually caring about the protagonists and hoping they'll get out alive.The plot I really like it's simple but feels plausible, whose to say no bomber had this in the back of their minds. And the best thing about the film is in it's suspense and pacing. I love the way it's structured it's sort of like a video game you just can't afford to take a breath, where in this film you have three different situations which are the Elevator, Bus, and Train, much like how each level of a game is always a different challenge; and all require for everyone to constantly move if they stay still for even a mere moment then it's game over forever.Also as the action is going along there are constant obstacles whether it's something in the way or even time itself, I like how the protagonists have to think throughly fast on how to get though this or survive that. It's true certain solutions are implausible like the one for the infamous 50 foot gap but it's a movie like with the TV show ""Macgyver"" it's fun to think some of those things could work. All this just kept me on the edge of my seat, just constantly worrying what else will happen, how worse can things get, and how are they going to survive this or that. Those are questions like the bus just constantly race though you mind the whole time which is another reason why the suspense works. Well thats as far as I go, Speed has enough millage for action.Rating: 4 stars",Speed
75,freemantle_uk,The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down,8,18 May 2020,"Speed was one of great '90s action film that stands with The Rock and Con Air for high concept fun. Speed's high concept was a bus has to keep its speed above 50mph or it would explode. The filmmakers used this idea to its fullest as the people on the bus face numerous challenges that could slow them down e.g. traffic, fuel leaks, and unfinished roads. There was a focus on a small cast of memorable characters and witty dialogue - Joss Whedon did uncredited rewrites and it showed. Speed was Jan de Bont's directorial debut and clearly learned from his time on the Die Hard set how to make a taut actioner.",Speed

BUT ... asking the audience to believe that a city bus can sustain a speed of 50 mph nonstop for one and half hours in the middle of a city without breaking down stretches the bounds of credulity. Maybe a Mazda, maybe a Porsche, maybe even a Greyhound or Short Line bus, or maybe even your standard commuter bus could have functioned intact, but an inner city bus? NO WAY!! It's enough that these buses work at all, much less that they could go 50 mph without breaking down within five minutes (okay let's make it ten minutes). It would have been more realistic if the bus was required to maintain a constant speed of, let's say, 20 mph. Now that would been far more believable and realistic. But when that bus does its flying act, like the General Lee flying through the air in the ""Dukes of Hazard"" or Burt Reynolds and Sally Fields doing the same in ""Smokey and the Bandit,"" that's when I knew that this movie had moved into the realm of science fiction. It would have been more believable to have had the bus launched into orbit around the earth, or to the moon.",Speed

Keanu Reeves appears at his most wooden while Sandra Bullock is still finding her sea legs as an actress, but the two still manage some level of incalculable chemistry that makes you pull for them through thick and thin. In many ways, their relationship is a great analogy for the film as a whole - generic and ham-fisted, you've seen it a thousand times before but for some inexplicable reason you're still perched on the edge of your seat for the duration.

And it is. No matter, because the aptly named Speed zips along at a breakneck pace, never allowing you to dwell on any of that. Reeves and Bullock have great chemistry, and it's easy to see why the former remains a star and the latter became (and remains) one. But the real star here may be Dennis Hopper (R.I.P.), who steals the show as the scene munching villain.I was really taken with how skillfully made this movie is. Like John McTiernan ('Predator', 'Die Hard'), Jan de Bont came out of the gate poised to be the next big thing, but after his next film, 'Twister', it was a swift fall from grace and a ""Whatever happened to..."".

After assuming Payne to be dead (after detonating a bomb strapped to him) Jack and Harry celebrate their success. However, it turns out that this was merely a ploy by Payne and his next play involves strapping a bomb to a bus which will detonate if the bus drops below 50mph once it has accelerated to this speed.As you can imagine with what is basically 'Die Hard on a bus' Speed is not short on entertainment and as a result of this it is never boring, but it does suffer slightly in the same vein that some other action films do...The problem with Speed is that it is a one-note and one concept idea; aside from the 'filler' at the start it is basically a bus travelling at over 50mph for well over an hour. As I've mentioned it is entertaining to an extent, but there's only so much you do with this type of concept before it runs out of steam (or fuel as is the case here). It doesn't really help that they are on a bus which can smash through roadblocks, cars and so on and they're also all on a bus that defies the laws of physics by cornering better than an F1 car. To be fair, I can roll with these sort of things when done in the name of entertainment, but I still need a reason to care about what I'm seeing and I have to be honest I wasn't fully invested in what was on show here.Dennis Hopper is the villain of the piece who is hacked off with the police and feels that they owe him a vast sum of money for an injury he sustained whilst working as part of their bomb disposal team. In this film he uses his expertise against his former colleagues which does present an interesting cat and mouse scenario, but with flimsy character development there's only so much that Hopper can do here (I give him full marks as he does an excellent job with what he had to work with). Keanu Reeves is actually pretty good as the heroic LAPD officer; there's a certain warmth to his character that makes him likeable and easy to root for. Sandra Bullock brings her usual affable dizzy charm and does OK even if she doesn't have much of a character to play here.The ending is over-the-top and silly and in some ways this forms part of the problem; the film is so ridiculous that at times it feels like a cartoon; check out the infamous scene with the 'bus jump' if you want to see what I'm talking about. In fact sometimes the only thing that reminded me that it wasn't a cartoon was that nobody dropped an anvil on Keanu Reeves head and that Porky Pig didn't show up at the end saying 'TTTTTThhhhattt's all folks!!!'Joking aside, this is a pretty entertaining film and at the very least it is fun unpretentious and never boring, but the cartoonish nature of the film meant that I found it to be distracting fun rather than a pulse-pounding thrill ride which is the main reason that I haven't given Speed a higher score.",Speed
82,dwpollar,Exciting but predictable action gimmick movie...,4,9 September 2009,"1st watched 9/7/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir- Jan De Bont): Exciting but predictable action gimmick movie is OK if you like these kind of movies, I guess. After seeing so many of these no-holds-barred, action-without-cease movies, you start knowing what's going to happen next and then it's over. The premise of this one surrounds around a man who wants money but is challenging the L.A. police department's bomb squad at the same time, for some reason(we find out later why). The enemy is played by Dennis Hopper and he isn't given much to work with in the role(he's a typical scumbag). The good guy(played by Keanu Reeves) is a maverick cop who gets in the way of him making his money after he puts a bomb in an elevator and it backfires. Sandra Bullock becomes the driver of the bus that has to stay going fifty miles an hour or it blows up(the 2nd challenge to the bomb squad). The cop knows what's going on and tries to save everyone as a maverick cop would normally do(especially if played by Keanu Reeves). There are a lot of holes in the silly plot and in my opinion, that' s why the movie doesn't work. Sure it's exciting, but the story behind it doesn't really come across as very believable. Also, technically there are some issues -- like background scenes behind the bus going way too slow for the bus to be going 50 miles per hour. This happens way too often. Sure, it's only a movie, but you'd think the director would think the audience might pick up on this. Something other than the action has to pull us in as well, and it doesn't. The actors aren't given much opportunity to act and the character's are not fleshed out at all. So we go home as an audience not really learning anything except we know we've been on a roller coaster ride for 2 hours(and I for one don't like roller coasters).

84,davispittman,Absolutely brilliant!,10,15 February 2016,"Speed is an excellent action movie! It's in my top 3 favorite action movies of all time, it has everything a great action movie needs: a good script, good acting, great exciting action sequences, and a good atmosphere. Speed has such a unique and cool plot to begin with, it's very creative and edge of your seat thrilling. Keanu Reeves was great in the lead! He took control and was very high energy throughout the whole thing, but then he also had the range to change from that to a nice warm hearted sweet guy, which I loved. Sandra Bullock was amazing here! This is one of her best performances In my personal opinion. And then there is Dennis hopper, no other guy could've pulled off the powerful performance that Dennis gave. He was so menacing and purely evil, which he needed to be. The dialogue was impactful and fitting, script was very well written. The action sequences were very edge of your seat and thrilling! That certainly kept you guessing the whole way through, and the visuals here are well constructed and cool to see. The ending is also very exciting and pleasing, it doesn't disappoint. The final line of the film is so great, it's happy and comedic/romantic, which was very fitting. 10/10!",Speed
85,hu675,One of the most memorable action movies of the 1990's.,8,4 December 2007,"Officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves), who's part of the SWAT Team along with his partner Det. Harold ""Harry"" Temple (Jeff Daniels) thought they will see the last of a mysterious mad bomber (Dennis Hopper). Who seemingly killed himself after being caught by Jack and Harry, when this mad bomber tried to kill full of people in a elevator shaft for ransom. Now Jack finds himself on the clock, when this terrorist calls him to tell him to try to catch the next transporting bus in the city of Los Angeles. Which he wants a big sum of money by only in a couple of hours. If this Bus goes down 50 MPH, the Bus will exploded. Now Jack finally caught on the bus by telling the passengers that their lives is also in danger. When one of the passengers accidentally shots the bus driver from panicking, one of the passengers named Annie (Sandra Bullock) takes over the bus. Which Jack has to do his best to keep the passengers claim until the SWAT Team tries to find out, who is this crazed terrorist before it's too late. Which this bad guy is actually quite clever. Now it is a race against time to find this bomber before they run out of gas on this bus before they get blown away.Directed by Jan de Bont (Lara Croft's Tomb Raider:The Cradle of Life, The Haunting ""1999"", Twister) made an enjoyable action-thriller with plenty of thrills, laughs, suspense and genuinely good character developments. Reeves plays his action hero extremely well. Bullock is charming in her supporting role that made her an movie star. Of course, Hopper has a great time playing this terrific bad-guy. This film was one of the biggest surprises in the summer of 1994 and it also got great reviews by the critics as well. Like any other action-pictures it has its share of flaws (Especially if you could see some the obvious continuity errors or revealing mistakes on the technical side of the movie). But this film is so much entertaining and fast-paced, that you might not think of it as first. After the success of ""Speed"", then three years later ""Speed 2:Cruise Control"" was produced. The sequel was one of the biggest box office disappointments in the U.S. and Reeves was wise enough to not reprise his role in that silly sequel. Which some fans of the original pretend that the sequel never existed. But still, ""Speed"" is a very good action movie and it is still better than some of the recent action-films out there. Alan Ruck is a hoot as the dull-witted passenger and Glenn Plummer is amusing as the Juguar Owner. Look close for Richard Schiff (From ""The West Wing"" fame) as the Train Driver. Written by Graham Yost (Broken Arrow, Hard Rain, Mission to Mars). Joss Whedon (Alien Resurrection, Serenity, Toy Story), who re-wrote much of the script is uncredited.

Enter police officer Jack Traven, a bomb squad hot shot who has once before thwarted this homicidal madman. Now Jack (Keanu Reeves) must find a way of boarding the moving vehicle in order to warn the civilians and save the day.Reeves stars in a role rumoured to be originally turned down by Arnold Schwarzenegger, and thank goodness for that. Keanu provides a fresh face and a degree of believability as the human hero (ala ""Die Hard"") that Schwarzenegger would have ruined. Supporting him are plenty of other enjoyable fresh faces including Sandra Bullock, partner Jeff Daniels and veteran actor Dennis Hopper who is most satisfying as the explosives nut case.Of course the main attraction is the fabulous action, death defying stunts and the thrilling suspense of the whole ordeal. While we know perfectly well that our hero will be triumphant in the end, trying to figure out how he'll squeeze through each tight spot is great fun. Cinematographer come debut director Jan De Bont adds his visual expertise to the production, and it certainly shows with some fantastic camera work ( Director of Photography Andrzej Bartkowiak). It's all rounded off with a suitable soundtrack.""Speed"" is never a new journey in the cinema experience, but it doesn't pretend to be.

Our hero must find a way to board the moving bus, deactivate the bomb, keep the passengers calm and ultimately save the day.""Speed"" has been very professionally put together and features spectacular stunts, ear splitting special sound effects (see it at the movies!) and eye popping visual effects.De Bont has given his film a confronting visual look and Andrzej Bartkowiak wields the camera with devastating effect. Dennis Hopper is sufficiently nutty and malevolent, Sandra Bullock's fresh faced good looks are a big help, while Keanu Reeves is a welcome change to the regular run of muscle-bound heroes like Arnie, Stallone and Van Damme.Never takes itself too seriously nor tries to look like something we haven't seen before, ""Speed"" just does what it does (high powered action) extremely well.Wednesday, June 14, 1995 - Video",Speed

89,Boyo-2,When action compensates for logic,3,5 August 2002,"A thriller must be logical all the way down the line.  It has to be very well-thought out from a writers standpoint.  If the early scenes are referenced later in the movie, they must be treated logically.  If peoples' lives are on the line, as an audience member you realize that their main purpose in the movie is to move that plot along, that they are devices for the writer, not actually PEOPLE in the best possible sense.  In this way, the movie got it fairly right.  No one on that bus is anything more than a stereotyped stock character, taken from many an Irwin Allen disasterous background. The villian should be colorful, have a variety of snide remarks with which to arm himself against the hero, and have a bone to pick with humanity as a whole.  The hero should have at least one expression other than anger, and the leading lady, if there is room for one in the budget, should be asking the illogical questions most of the audience wants an answer to. 
It should all add up at the end, it should be accountable to itself. 
This is not that movie although it got some things right.  Bullock was not yet a star so had little to lose by just being herself.  Keanu is so one-note that he looks constipated.  Casting Dennis Hopper as a villian is as original as casting Meg Ryan as a bagette-carrying New Yorker with a laptop and a mop-top haircut, who has a lot to give the right guy. 
Unfortunately, Jeff Daniels, Glenn Plummer and Joe Morton, previously thought to respect their craft, are along for the ride, too.
One question - how did the bus still run after the gas tank was punctured? Just curious.   I have two dozen similar questions, but need an answer to that one first.  If that has a decent answer, then maybe its just me alone that expects it all to make some sense.  3/10.",Speed

94,PredragReviews,Cans!!!!! It's just cans!!!....,9,9 March 2017,"""Speed"" is one of the best action films with a few comedy bits; it is so great that it will live you clinging to your chair. There are lots of action, suspense and great explosions that will bow you away. Speed does live up to its title, even if you see it multiple times; the suspense is still there. Speed has a great cast including Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper, Joe Morton, Jeff Daniels and Sandra Bullock. The plot is as strong as a rock: After seeing his painstakingly crafted bomb plot fail at the hands of two L.A. Cops (Reeves and Daniels), the bomber (Hopper) sets about exacting his revenge by setting a bus to explode if its speed drops below 50mph. The tension is expertly crafted, the film adjusts its pace at the all right times and the character development and attention to detail make the film rounded enough to avoid the trap of it becoming a formulaic action or disaster movie. A smart script full of nice touches and clever one-liners keeps you listening as well as watching. The result exceeds your expectations time and again throughout the length of the film.Hopper makes the film, and although this shot Reeves' star right into the stratosphere, he still clearly is just a pretty face, as he cannot act for toffee. Bullock gives the best performance of her career (what a shame she consistently picked turkeys after leading in this epic) as the gutsy damsel at the wheel, and Reeves (let's be kind) grunts and flexes his way through the film except on the few occasions when his acting ability is uncomfortably stretched. Jeff Daniels meanwhile appears like a different human from the actor who goofed around so hilariously in ""Dumb and Dumber."" Overall, this movie is excellently made with big wonderful explosions, great casts, non-stop actions, a fast movie and it's like a roller coaster.Overall rating: 9 out of 10.",Speed

I think it was called 'The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down'."" - Homer SimpsonThat pretty much sums up this film, but to go a bit more in depth...A disgruntled ex cop takes his issues out on other people with the creative use of bombs. Keanu Reeves saves the day by stopping an elevator bombing scare. This pisses Dennis Hopper off so much that he devises a new plan of putting a bomb on a bus. If the bus goes below 50, the bomb will go off. Can Keanu save the day?And will we ever see a movie like this again? There is something about this film that makes it special. The action blockbuster that ignited the careers of both Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves. The film does not require a strong leading man, just someone who is able to pull off these stunts. Reeves is able to make it look legit and even though people complain about his acting, he is in no way irritating. Bullock spends most of the film behind the wheel of the bus, so of course she falls in love with the guy. Wait, what? Ah, who cares, right? This kind of stuff always happened in the 90's. Girl falls in love with the good looking guy who saves the day. But those relationships never last (evidence in the lame sequel)Dennis Hopper is one bad ass guy. He plays crazy so well, his role here is not Blue Velvet Frank Booth crazy, but cray nonetheless. The film is even more enjoyable due to the supporting cast of characters that are on the bus with the two stars. Jeff Daniels plays the buddy cop part, but due to the events in the opening of the film, has to stay at home for the exciting parts on the bus. With the exception of the bus jumping the gap in the highway scene, which makes me roll my eyes every single time, the film is entertaining and will keep your interest. For a film to take place on a bus for 80% of the film, they did a really good job of not letting that annoy the audience. The film is the perfect formula for action junkies. It has a lot of those adrenaline rush scenes. For me it kind of looses it's steam when the film goes to the subway, but that doesn't ruin the overall excitement and feel of the film.Speed is one of the best action films of the 90's. There, I said it. I can probably sit down and watch it and never really feel bored. Kudos for making the film watchable many times and still have that rush.

Most of them always look exactly the same, only on a different location. You get a lot of shooting and explosions, some Karate or Kung-Fu moves..., we all know the recipe. However, sometimes you'll find a more original one and ""Speed"" certainly is one of them.Howard Payne tries to extort money from the city of LA by threatening to kill some people, who are being trapped in an elevator, with explosives. When Jack Traven and Harry Temple save all those people, they are being celebrated as heroes. But Payne will not rest until he gets his money and he sets a new challenge for Traven: a bomb on a city bus which will arm itself when the bus reaches 50 mph and which will explode if the bus drops below that speed or if any of the passengers try to escape. Traven tries to stop the buss in time, but it is already too late, now all he can do is to keep it going...The acting in this movie is more than average.

But as I already said in my title, as long as that bus was driving I was sitting on the edge of my seat. The only problem is that there was a part before and after that sequence and those parts didn't really do it for me.

You'll end up drunker than Lindsey Lohan.SPEED - an action movie that delivers a thrill a minute, almost as often as you have to take a drink - arguably put Sandra Bullock, Keanu Reeves and director Jan de Bont on the blockbuster map.Though this movie is best known for its extended bus sequence, it is composed of three vignettes - elevator (vertical speed), bus (variable speed) and train (accelerative speed).Segment One: People trapped in elevator - two elevator repair men arrive in a gratuitous flying police car. They are Jack (Keanu) and Harry (Jeff Daniels). One of them is the Brain, one of them the Overactor. I'll let you decide which. Elevator blown up by mad bomber, Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper, doing his Dennis Hopper). Take breath. Onto next segment.Apparently, driving a bus is so easy a caveman can do it, as a Downtown Los Angeles bus is piloted by Nearderthal-browed Sam (Hawthorne James), transporting a bunch of extras for a Bennetton ad. Bus boarded by gregarious Annie (Sandra Bullock, back when she was just a cute little comer with great legs, not the big-headed icon she would become).Writer Graham Yost seems to have gotten every ethnicity and job description on that bus, The Construction Worker, The Tourist, The Old Lady, The Asian, The Paka Lady, The Policeman, The Token Blacks, The White Preppy, The 1930s Lady, but I think he forgot the Indian Chief.Mad Bomber gives ultimatum to Jack: ""There's a bomb on a bus. Once the bus reaches 50 miles an hour, the bomb is armed. If it drops below 50, it blows up. What do you do?"" Well, considering it's 9:00 a.m. in Los Angeles peak hour traffic, on the 10 freeway near Santa Monica, I'd start placing bets that the bus couldn't possibly get up to 50 miles an hour in the first place. Then I'd have breakfast.Instead, Keanu clambers onboard the moving bus to try to smoosh up against Sandy's legs as much as possible. Luckily, one of the stereotypes has brought a gun - to shoot the caveman bus driver - precipitating Sandy's Legs having to take the wheel and drive herself into the hearts of America.Joe Morton is the bomb squad chief whose stage directions from de Bont were, ""Okay, see these lines of script? Now shout them into a walkie-talkie."" Jack assesses the bomb with technical jargon: ""There's enough C4 on this thing to put a hole in the world!"" Is that a lot? We could complain about the unreality of taking hard right turns at 50 mph, or the physics impossibility of a laden bus jumping a freeway chasm without an approach ramp, or the fact that Keanu couldn't possibly consider his performance ""acting"" - but everyone's just having way too much fun.By the time we are onto Segment Three - the runaway train - our adrenalin is kinda tapped out and it seems superfluous. But Keanu gets to smoosh up against Sandy again, with an added bonus - she's handcuffed to a vertical bar in the carriage.By the time the 752nd ""Hang on!"" comes, we're ready for rehab.",Speed

105,inspectors71,Not What One Would Refer to as a Christmas Movie,8,2 April 2014,"Yet, that's when I saw Jan de Bont's Speed, cuddled up in our new house in the wee hours of Christmas morning, 1994, I think. I couldn't turn it off.And the reasons for this were:Speed is a wonderfully energetic piece of film-making. It mixes the formulaic with the fresh, the mad criminal (Dennis Hopper) with the hero (Keanu Reeves), but this time, with a strong and gutty blue-collar woman (Sandra Bullock). The hook--the bus that can't slow down or the bomb will go off--is both simple and effective. And, de Bont never lets the action subside. He knows he has a winner here, and he'll be damned if he'll let anyone be a slacker!Is Speed great cinema? Yes, but it's because it's a technically superior piece of entertainment. Nobody's going to remember it for the acting.What we will remember, past the thrills, is meeting Sandra Bullock.Bullock is such a big star now that her breakout performance may get forgotten for younger audiences. De Bont must have seen that she would power this picture with her humanity, quirky good looks, and chutzpah.Which brings me back to Christmas morning, 3 a.m. or so. Across the room sat the TV and VCR. I held the remote, and when my wife would stir, I would pause the tape and wait. It took some time to get through the movie because, although she slept well that morning, my wife was and is a light sleeper. The only reason I mention this Christmas stuff is that watching Speed felt like that Christmas present your folks let you open on Christmas Eve. It was a delight, and considering how good Sandra Bullock is as an actress--and I forgive her for The Proposal--and how deeply lovely she is, Speed is a present that I still appreciate 20 odd years later.Now, Keanu Reeves in the remake of The Day the Earth Stood Still, that's where my forgiveness and Christmas spirit dry up.",Speed

The Bomber places a speed sensitive bomb on board a bus that will activate at 50 miles per hour and will detonate once it drops below that speed. Now Traven must work with the passengers and within the bomber's rules to try and save them.The directorial debut of cinematographer Jan de Bont whose work can be seen in Die Hard, Basic Instinct, and a few others, the movie takes what's on paper sounds like a ridiculous premise and makes it believable thanks to tight direction and precision editing that makes the film a roller coaster ride from start to finish.Keanu Reeves as Jack Traven much like John McClane from Die Hard isn't the archetypal action hero blasting bad guys left and right, while Traven definitely does a lot of action in the movie, most of his actions are at the risk of his own life so he can save others. From the opening sequence where he tries to reinforce a damaged elevator, to the later sequences on board the bus and even around the bus, Traven repeatedly risks his life in death defying stunts so he can save people. While Reeves isn't the best actor in the wolrd, he has a natural likability that comes through and has particularly good chemistry with his partner Harry and Boss Mac (played by Jeff Daniels and Joe Morton respectively) and Reeves works well playing against the other actors in the film. But the standout performance belongs to Sandra Bullock as Annie who becomes a reluctant hero who works alongside Traven to keep the bus from running off the road. Bullock makes a great impression in the early scenes as she tries to catch the bus and her down to earth every woman appeal makes her a great foil/love interest with Traven. There's some really good scenes shared between Reeves and Bullock and help to sell the nonsense on display.But the real star of Speed is the action, and does it deliver. The movie starts at 10 and stays at 10 for the entirety of the movie and does everything it can with its setpieces of an elevator, a bus, and subway train respectively, and despite the action often giving the middle finger to physics, the movie never gives you an opportunity to breathe so you have enough time to question it.Speed is a silly movie, but it's also an entertaining movie.

For whatever reason, 80s movies stand out more to me over time (not just action movies, but movies in general). As accusatory as people are about the 80s being ""dated"", I have a hard time not laughing at some of the absurd, odd apparel and grooming choices of society in the 90s. Thankfully, a good film can overcome these obstacles and not appear dated. This one, SPEED (1994) fits the bill!Starring Keanu Reeves, who in my opinion delivers his greatest film performance, ""Speed"" is an ""adrenaline rush"" of a movie. The movie starts with an intense, suspenseful sequence of a group of people trapped in an elevator rigged with a bomb set to detonated by it's creator psychopath Howard Payne (played solidly by Dennis Hopper). Enter our film's hero Officer Jack Traven (played by Reeves), a member of the LAPD S.W.A.T. team, along with his partner Harry (winningly played by Jeff Daniel). Harry is the typical snarky sidekick of the film's action hero, but Daniels' reliably goofy personality makes it work. This film actually makes me understand why he was good in ""Dumb and Dumber""! LOL Reeves and Daniels buddy chemistry is believable.After Jack and Harry save the day, Payne is presumed dead in an explosion. A few months pass, and two city buses are rigged to explode. Turns out Payne is very much alive and out to play cat-and- mouse with Jack. Payne detonates the first bus, then tells Jack where the second one is. Jack finds the bus, but the catch is that once it goes over 50mph, it has to stay above that speed or the bomb will detonate, thus the plot of ""Speed""!In a surprising development, one of the bus passengers Annie (wonderfully played by then relative unknown, but now famous Sandra Bullock), who was on her way to work, must take over the wheel and keep the bus above 50mph. Along for the ride are a group of reliable supporting players: Joe Morton as the S.W.A.T team leader and Alan Ruck, Beth Grant, and Carlos Carrasco as part of the group of frustrated and frenetic bus passengers.Interestingly, the film starts off with hostages trapped in an LA high-rise office building, a la ""Die Hard"", of which ""Speed"" has been called a ripoff in some circles. But ""Speed"" still works as it's own entity mainly due to Jack Traven feeling like an original character due to Reeves' strong acting and convincing performance as a cop and action hero, the Jack-Annie dynamic, and even the overall vibe of ""Speed"" is more fast-paced than ""Die Hard"". ""Die Hard"" is still the seminal action film, but ""Speed"" is a great addition to the genre. In particular the stunts are very well-staged, convincingly delivered, and don't feel implausible for the most part. Now, the film definitely has a few minuses. Other than the action, of which there is a lot, much of the non-action scenes are the standard of most action films. While Hopper is very good as the villain of the piece, he's not nearly as memorable as other action movie bad guys, like the ones from the original Lethal Weapon and Die Hard movies. I've also read people say that Bullock steals the film, and I think that's incredibly overstated. Her role isn't as large in this as I initially remembered. While her chemistry with Keanu is palpable, this film is Reeves' movie all the way. While he may be the weaker actor overall of the main cast, in this film, REEVES steals the show! Although Jan De Bont would go onto to direct the extremely cheesy ""Twister"" and the awful sequel to this film ""Speed 2"", both dubious projects to say the least, he can always hang his hat on ""Speed"" as being one of the most intense, engrossing action movie experiences of the 90s, if not of all time.",Speed
108,vip_ebriega,Buckle up for safety! SPEED hits the streets,10,22 April 2008,"My Take: A terrific summer movie. Grab on to your seat and buckle up for one heck of a ride. If you don't know how it feels to get ""involved"" in a movie's premise, then better rent SPEED and experience it yourself. Living under the shadow of DIE HARD, SPEED elevates the seemingly familiar premise into a virtuoso of action scenes and great pyrotechnics, plentiful enough for three action movies. Not contended with keeping our palms sweaty during a daring rescue in a trapped elevator, the movie turns into a mad dash across the traffic-ridden streets of L.A. during rush hour, and then later, a showdown atop a speeding subway train. If you are not thrilled, at least, by one of these action scenarios, then better go see a doctor just in case your pulse is still running.Instead of ripping-off John McLane from the DIE HARD pictures, which is what a mediocre action knock-off would have done, we are treated with a great action hero. Keanu Reeves is Jack Traven, an LAPD bomb squad officer who, during the first hour, must try to save a couple of people trapped inside an elevator, while a mad (no, eccentric) maniac (played with real villainy by Dennis Hopper) awaits his demand of cash.When that's all said and done, he must now drive a bus above 50 mph to avoid the bomb in the bus from blowing up. See, if the bus drops speed below 50, it blows up big time. It would have been easy if he was driving this bus at night, but this is rush hour, cars and traffic are everywhere. He gets a lot of help from a loyal passenger, played by Sandra Bullock, who truly shines in the role, given that she is given much more to do than your typical damsel. Director (and former cinematographer) Jan DeBont has a field day in his directorial debut, giving the film the touch of class that action classics, like the DIE HARD films, possess. If I may just note: DeBont was also the cinematographer of action greats like DIE HARD and TOTAL RECALL.SPEED is one of those few action thrillers that won't disappoint, as well as those that don't make idiots out of the audience. Sure, some parts of SPEED are questionable to logic, but it moves fast enough (and I mean really fast!) to make you forget them. Another great deal about SPEED is that it doesn't get tired of itself. It knows it can do more, and it delivers. When it's done with one scenario, it proceeds to another, and gives as another new scenario there, and the clichés are thankfully unused due to the originality of its special effects. But most of all, it has a lot of fun with itself, as the audience has a lot of fun with it.Forget the bloated, uninspired films that claim to be better, a great rental (or better yet, purchase) of SPEED on DVD is twice the treat. Action fans will have so much fun with it as much as non-action fans will love it. SPEED is a clever, thrill-a-minute juggernaut that, simply put, a lot of fun.Rating: ***** out of 5.",Speed
109,Stampsfightclub,Bombs and Buses,9,18 January 2008,"Keanu Reeves (The Matrix) stars as Officer Jack Traven, a professional police officer who is caught up in a deadly game with Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper). Payne puts a bomb on a city bus, and if the bus drops below 50mph, it will explode.Jan De Bont (Twister) delivers twists and turns in this high paced edge of your seat action thriller.A plot which has Oscar winning special effects, Speed will keep you on the edge of your seat with fast buses, trains, lifts and explosive scenes justifying the thriller genre. The plot to keeps you guessing and engaged with character situations essential.Hopper's character is marvellous. One of the best villains I have seen, Howard Payne is in control and a genius at causing problems for the public and police force as he demands money for his trouble.Keanu Reeves also portrays his Officer exceptionally well, portraying him as very professional and organised and adventurous. The relationship between Traven and Payne makes the film even more engaging and exciting as it becomes very personal.It's the suspense which makes this film. As the bus speeds around the city it faces many obstacles in order to get through unscathed and when unbelievable circumstances arise it's up to Traven and the passengers to tackle.the use of the bus is wonderful, with a very claustrophobic feel to it adds to the pressure and situation. Situations involving bombs are also significant to add to the pressure There are also some great catch phrases to be heard.When certain scenes have featured you may question the realism of the event and I myself have a few views about that, but the bottom line is that this is a high paced energetic thriller with stunning effects, plot, scenarios, and acting and is not to be missed.",Speed
110,Mister-6,"""Speed""-y delivery...",9,30 April 2000,"Pop quiz, hot-shot - what's the most exciting action movie you've ever seen with a bus in it?Right, the answer is ""Speed"" and if you've seen it then you'll have to agree that there is more action in this one movie than any ten generic action flicks that have been released in the last ten years.A trend-setter the likes of ""Die Hard"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Lethal Weapon"", ""Speed""'s premise is simple - a bus is wired by a madman (Dennis Hopper) to blow up if it drops below 50 MPH.  This is to give the cop (Keanu Reeves) who ruined his last effort a run for his money in trying to save the day.  In the ensuing efforts, a woman (Sandra Bullock) is recruited to drive the bus and keep it over 50 MPH at all times.And for as deceivingly simple as it is, ""Speed"" pulls out all the stops by making every scene a nail-biter (the bomb discovery, Keanu getting aboard the bus, Sandra driving over an incomplete gap in a highway, etc. - the list is endless) and all the main characters (and a few of the supporting ones) are about as smart as your average movie-goer and have enough of these kinds of movies to figure out what the other guy's move will be and act on it.  I LOOOOVE movies like that.Keanu is far more heroic in this movie than he has been before (and since); Jeff Daniels is born to play best pal and does so with good-nature; Sandra is a delight to watch as well as hear - she has a voice you literally can wrap yourself up in; Hopper adds to his nutso roles with some droll lines that sound all the spicier delivered Hopper-style.  Everyone is great and gives their all.The movie is all one long action set-piece, which is what the action fan expects when they plunk down their money then sit down with their popcorn. They get their money's worth here and then some.  ""Speed"" was obviously written by someone who loves action films as much as the action film fans that watch them.  Good match-up.Nine stars for ""Speed"", and let's hear it for the magic of surveillance cameras.",Speed

112,ivo-cobra8,Will forever remain one of the greatest best action movies of all time!,10,15 November 2015,"Speed (1994) is one of the best action movie ever made!!!! It is one of my personal favorite Keanu Reeves action movies. I just wish they wouldn't made sequel because it doesn't even compare to the first one. Speed 2: Cruise Control can't hold a candle to this movie. For me the sequel never happened. I only own this movie in Blu-ray collection and that is all. I love the theme score in the beginning of the movie and I love music at end of credits. I just love this movie, alongside with The Matrix, Johnny Mnemonic and Point Break is one of my favorite action film of Keanu Reeves. This movie is one of those films that is worth of watch and money. It seems like now this days, action films force themselves into a wickedly strange plot to try to be the next sixth sense and put more money into each explosion than into any actors. This is a film that you just love everybody in the movie because the acting is great as well as the original story line. Sure, its no Oscar winning type of film, but if your at home looking for a fun film to watch, SPEED is the right movie for you. Keanu Reeves & Sandra Bullock's chemistry really made this movie work. This movies Is a badass! It is directed by Jan de Bont the same director who directed the god awful sequel. This movie is just great, it is Die Hard on a bus. Speed is simply similar to other sequel movie like are Die Hard With A Vengeance (1995) that come out one year later, when Sandra was handcuffed on the train and Keanu was saving her, the same cuffing scene was later used in Die Hard With A Vengeance. McClane been on a train that explodes and goes off the barrels out of an incomplete stretch of track and crashes, the same scene was used from this movie. Die Hard With A vengeance borrowed out some scenes from this movie including China Town line. I still love both of these movies, they are both great action films of the 90's and one of my all time favorite Keanu Reeves movies. Speed is a classic in modern terms and one of Keanu Reeves best performances. This movie had me on the edge of my seat from the opening scene. One of the iconic movies of the 1990's, Speed is a highly entertaining, slick and polished action movie. It's a benchmark movie of its genre that was high in tension and excitement without the unruly gore of a 1980's action flick. The story itself is very good; it has some important depth to it that missing from most action movies. The cast is rock solid; Keanu Reeves was perfectly cast as Jack Traven, a smart, agile but reckless police officer with a tendency to disobey orders and creates inventive solutions to get the job done. Jeff Daniels plays the sympathetic, wise polar opposite partner, Harry Temple, well. Dennis Hopper chews the scenes excellently as the charismatic and twisted maniac of villain. Sandra Bullock Annie couldn't be more likable and innocent. Joe Morton's character as the Chief is lively enough to support the lead and the rest of the cast is definitely solid.The movie is a near perfect one for me. It's like a minor terrorist who knows the police force and knows how to work w/ bombs which is really cool. Not only that Keanu Reeves makes an awesome cop and they have a great cast and supporting cast. Dennis Hopper makes a great villain, Sandra makes a great tough girl, and Jeff makes a great partner. I love the plot and the length of the movie. First starting off with a bomb on an elevator and then on a bus. And since it revolves around the bus ride the entire time they do a good job with adding little problems they must overcome to ensure the bus does not explode, such as sharp turns and getting on an unfinished bridge so they can stay over 50 mph.Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves), an LAPD cop on SWAT detail, has a fearless nature and a keen understanding of the criminal mind. That, and some luck have kept him alive. But Jack's luck is being put to the ultimate test. An elusive bomber-extortionist Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) is seeking vengeance after his latest ransom scheme is thwarted. Payne gives a personal challenge to Jack: A bomb is rigged on a city bus, which will detonate if the speedometer drops below 50 MPH. Poor Annie (Sandra Bullock) gets shoved into the driver's seat, while Jack does his best to save the day.That is the basic plot, it is a slick film about a young cop who must prevent a bomb exploding aboard on a city bus by keeping its speed above 50 mph. and stop a terrorist by executing his plan. I am giving this movie a 10/10 it hell deserves it! I have fun watching it and I still love the score of the films. Great solid action flick of Keanu Reeves I love it!",Speed

Episodic in structure, the movie pits Hopper's vengeful psychopath against SWAT member Keanu Reeves (whose career went into overdrive from this point onward), and barely pauses for breath along the way. Debut director (and erstwhile cinematographer) Jan de Bont transforms Graham Yost's modest screenplay into a super-charged thrill-machine, photographed (by Andrzej Bartkowiak) and edited (by John Wright) to perfection, and augmented by some of the best stuntwork and visual effects money can buy. The cast is a ragbag of new faces, old-timers and dependable character actors: Reeves and Hopper dominate the show, while leading lady Sandra Bullock 'makes cute' in a career-making performance, and there's strong support from Jeff Daniels (DUMB & DUMBER) and Joe Morton (THE BROTHER FROM ANOTHER PLANET) in crucial secondary roles. Followed by SPEED 2: CRUISE CONTROL (1997).NB. A 'sleeper' hit by Hollywood blockbuster standards, the film owes a narrative debt to Junya Sato's Japanese thriller THE BULLET TRAIN (1975), in which a terrorist bomb is primed to explode on board a packed commuter train if it falls below a certain speed. It's possible SPEED was written and produced in complete ignorance of the earlier film, but no one connected with de Bont's version seems willing to address the similarities.",Speed

Dennis Hopper is excellent (as always) as the bitter nine-fingered bad guy who is bent on getting compensation for his service as an officer that left him jobless and thumbless, and only rewarded with ""a cheap gold watch"". Sandra Bullock delivers the perfect amount of wittiness before it crosses the overkill line; and Morton (who also shows up uncredited in the sequel) and Daniels are great in their supporting roles. Surprisingly intense despite the straightforward mindless action and lack of any kind of twists. Perhaps making the SPEED something like 35 MPH instead of 50 would've allowed just the right touch of realism to make this one a true gem, but more is apparently merrier to some. An all-in-all fun film that never slows down (it can't!) and is easy to follow—though no one will seek it out for its depth; even the supporting cast recognizes that Reeves' character lacks any sort of wisdom, with the villain even threatening: ""Do not attempt to grow a brain"".

Never before my bleeding eyes has there been a movie so exciting, and yet, so suspenseful and pulse-pounding that it blows all the other ""me-too"" action movies out of the water as fast as you can say ""Roadkill!""! The opening is incredible enough to feel that you can't take any more high intensity, and that's only warming up. Among the breakthroughs is Sandra Bullock, for whom this movie confirms her now-classic signature role as ""Annie"", taking over the driver's seat and SPEEDing along. If it sounds like just another runaway bus, then you're missing everything else! The high-powered plot is hands down, the most well-conceived idea that it can be derived from past ""disaster"" films of the 70s. A simple bomb threat creates a widespread panic for all of us sitting around eating popcorn and drinking Coke.

It is meant to be a thrill ride, not to be something people discuss for hours afterward.There are plot holes, but they are not huge ones. The bus is rather quickly sent from the middle of traffic out to a roadway under construction with no traffic, and the gold watch in the bus bomb does provide a clue to the bomber's identity.

121,virek213,"26 Years Later, Keep Being Ready For Rush Hour",10,24 May 2020,"Since the 1980s it has been rare for action films to offer up something more than just testosterone-laden violence. But this was indeed what the 1994 blockbuster SPEED was: a sleeper hit and a breath of fresh air for the genre. While it may have much of the same violence and profanity of most action films, it also has a fair amount of suspense, tension, and black comedy as well. Above all else, it has characters one can identify with, plus an absolutely requirement for any really good action film: a credible and despicable villain. Coming from what had already become a disreputable genre among critics for the most part, SPEED actually got a huge amount of critical acclaim, not to mention a $350 million box office take on a budget of a mere $30 million-and this at a time when the cost of a typical Hollywood studio action film had already crossed the $75 million threshold.Keanu Reeves stars as an elite L.A.P.D. officer who, along with the help of his erstwhile partner (Jeff Daniels), defuses the bomb of a madman (Dennis Hopper) inside an elevator in a high rise in Downtown Los Angeles. Daniels is wounded in a brief standoff with Hopper; and Hopper escapes, having not collected the $3 million he demanded for those being held hostage in the elevator.Days later, Hopper plans his revenge against Reeves. This time, Hopper has placed a bomb underneath a commuter bus heading from Santa Monica to Downtown L.A. via the Santa Monica Freeway. The catch is that this bomb is armed the moment the bus hits 50 miles per hour, and that the bomb will detonate if the bus slows below 50. Hopper demands $3.7 million and warns Reeves that, if he tries to take any passengers off the bus, he will detonate the bomb regardless. Reeves is forced into quick action, hopping on the bus in the middle of the freeway and scaring the hell out of all the passengers. One of them, a scared Latino with a gun, accidentally shoots the bus driver, briefly causing the bus to go out of control. A female passenger (Sandra Bullock) is forced to take control of the bus, and is told by Reeves to do whatever it takes to keep going over 50. The bus's path takes it off the Santa Monica Freeway at Western Avenue, then south to the unopened Century Freeway (I-105), then to the runways at LAX. There, Reeves manages to outwit Hopper and evacuate the passengers, with a, how shall we say, a rather explosive result. But Hopper isn't quite vanquished even after all that.While there are admittedly a few of the plot problems normally associated with action movies, SPEED nevertheless delivers much in the way of suspense and camera work, with the influences of films like DUEL, ROLLERCOASTER, THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE, and DIE HARD flowing right through it. Reeves and Bullock make for such an appealing and believable pair that one can't help but be involved in their situation. Hopper makes for a credible enough villain, even as it's a role he could have conceivably done in his sleep. The most amazing thing about the film is the sureness of the direction of Jan DeBont, previously a cinematographer on CUJO, DIE HARD, and THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER. DeBont clearly studied not only the films of Hitchcock, but also of Steven Spielberg, and even Sam Peckinpah, in the way action, suspense, and a certain amount of violence (none of the latter especially gratuitous) are combined to make a thoroughly memorable brew. There is also a winking nod to Stanley Kubrick as well, at the end.An Oscar winner for Sound and Sound Effects Editing, SPEED displayed a tremendous amount of energy in its execution and performance. But it also became a prime masterpiece of a genre that had very few masterpieces like it since the 1980s, and would have fewer still from 1994 forward.To this day, SPEED still warrants a '10' spot.",Speed

123,Bogmeister,You'll Feel the Need to Feed on Speed!,9,20 April 2006,"If viewing this film for the first time, you should get a powerful visceral experience which is all too rare today. In fact, I'd venture to say that this is one of the last movies to offer full-fledged excitement before current computer FX overwhelmed Hollywood so that all action films now have a veil of superficiality covering everything (yes, ""Speed"" also had computer FX, but they were surreptitious back then). I'd say, around the mid-nineties, after ""Seven"" or so, all the action films became closer to computer games rather than actual action-adventure FILMS. ""Speed"" was, in many ways, a last gasp of film action in the pure sense - you feel that pulse of the old-style slam-bang dazzle right from the opening credits, moving down an elevator shaft which could be a computer simulation, but immediately it gives way to classic jeopardy involving flesh-and-blood villains (Hopper), sweaty victims-in-peril, and sweatier tough cops-as-heroes (Reeves, Daniels) coping with horrendous dilemmas. OK, some of the modern bland action thrills already pervaded this thriller, but it's still much too real compared to all the silly moving pictures pervading our theaters in the 21st century.This is also that rare film which really never has a slow moment. Some might label that aspect as unrealistic, but this is what it was meant to be - it's de Bont's finest hour; he was a director of photography before this and produced only adequate pictures after this. Somehow, he captured a perfect formula for this, his inaugural stewardship. It's great for a first viewing, but I was caught up in watching this several times in the nineties, to try and duplicate those visceral shocks a 2nd & 3rd time. I also found it was one of those movies I could watch with a couple of other people in the room and get caught up in the excitement as a group experience - there was never time to speak of other matters during some slow spots, as in during most other films. We, meaning the audience, are on that bus with the passengers after the first half-hour and for the next hour of a super-ride that everyone needs to experience at least once in their lifetime. And you'll probably want to give it a try at least one more time afterward.Reeves' performance as the hero is an aberration for his film career. All the reasons to be mystified by his success in movies or his penchant for slow-witted, laughable characters are missing. He'd had a chance to play a straight action hero before, in ""Point Break,"" but he was an older boy there; here he's a young man, a coiled spring built in the mold of serious action heroism. When he threatens the deranged villain, there's no chance to mock his style, to be amused at his efforts at intensity - he's a lethal, dangerous figure here. I almost believe now that some substitute for Reeves was placed in most of his scenes here, since he never returned to such effective presence. Then, of course, we have Bullock. This was where her impish quality, with some moxie thrown in, got its greatest workout - no surprise at all that she became a big star after this. To say that she manages the perfect note in all her scenes is...well, let's just leave it at that. Plummer in a brief role as the jaguar driver - priceless! (He returned in the weak sequel, against all odds).

124,moviesleuth2,Great Action Flick,10,24 August 2008,"The premise of a summer action movie doesn't get much better than this one: A bus in downtown LA is rigged with a bomb that is set to explode if it goes below 50 mph. But as film history will tell us, a good premise does not make a good movie unless the filmmakers do unique and interesting things with it. Does ""Speed"" have what it takes? Absolutely.When it comes to action/adventure movies that expand on a single premise, there's no one better than Jan de Bont. Considering where his career is right now, that surprising, since the man who gave us masterpieces such as this and ""Twister"" is being passed over for hacks and wannabees such as Simon West and other cheap posers that don't know what they're doing. de Bont never wastes a moment, and that keeps the pace up. ""Speed"" is relentless, especially in this respect. The visuals are first-rate, and except for one minor exception, they surpass today's (if only because they are real, or the CGI isn't so cheap it's obvious).The acting is great as well. There are few actors as consistently wooden as Keanu Reeves (save for Luke Wilson). But I guess every actor has his day (Reeves has three: this, ""The Devil's Advocate"" and ""The Matrix""). Granted, the role doesn't require much range, but Reeves creates a likable and sympathetic hero (California cool included). Dennis Hopper is a terrific villain, rivalling Alan Rickman in ""Die Hard,"" though Hopper is more psychotic, or in his own words, ""eccentric."" Also noteworthy is the terrifically lovable Sandra Bullock who uses her comic aptitude to great effect, and she also allows herself to be vulnerable, which makes her more three-dimensional.Like in de Bont's later film, ""Twister,"" composer Mark Macina creates a memorable theme that complements the film to perfection.Flaws aren't really a problem here (I dare anyone to name an action movie that hasn't given into temptation and gone over the top at least a little). Yes it recycles one of the twists that it used, but it still works, so I can't really fault it.Finally here's a movie that lives up to its premise and its title.",Speed
125,rossrobinson,fantastic,10,3 November 2003,"Speed is a fantastic well acted action movie. This was made in 1994, set on a Bus in a city. This was a great action movie to follow. Keanu Reeves is a fantastic actor and i think he is great at doing movies like this, The Matrix and many more. I give Speed 10 out of 10 because it is a great movie and there are great actors in it.",Speed
126,Min111,This is very quick,7,1 October 2014,"The main story is about a LA swat officer known as Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) who is saving passengers from a Bus, and an enemy who demands a large sum of money in very little time. Its up to Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) to not only save the passengers on the Bus, but to also catch that culprit responsible for it.Speed was no doubt a true action movie. What makes the movie unique compared to any other action movie is that the plot takes place right from the morning. Nearly all the other action movies, especially during the nineties take place late afternoon and evening, so it's good to see a different action movie for a change.Its a good and interesting movie with a lot of action for everyone to enjoy, and I would recommend it for anyone that hasn't seen it already.The movie also has other well known popular casts like Sandra Bullock, who played the character Annie Corter, a fellow passenger, and Jeff Daniels from 101 Dalmatians, who played the character Harry Temple, a fellow swat team member and partner of Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves).",Speed

Dennis Hopper plays the main bad guy and it's pretty much like all Dennis Hopper bad guy roles. This film just flies by and never loses the momentum it builds. Good movie.",Speed
128,departed07,What a beautiful rush!,10,24 February 2008,"Pop quiz movie viewers: How do you declare one of the most sophisticated action movies of the early nineties? Awesome! Jan De Bont's ""Speed"" is a thriller of all angles in which you have to keep guessing in the intense scenes on what is going to happen next. Sometimes you'll be right while in other moments you'll be forced to cover your mouths and gasps at the curtain surprises.The film's beginning prologue introduces sadistic madman Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper, Blue Velvet) trying to accomplishment one of his life scheming goals: blow up a bomb in an elevator. On the outside, SWAT members Jack Travers (Keanu Reeves) and his partner Harry (Jeff Daniels) arrive and try to deter the elevator from falling before Payne realizes that somebody is trying to stop his plan.Payne's plan fails before he comes up with another solution. Since he figures that Detective Travers is up for a challenge, Payne places another bomb on a bus where if it drops below 50 miles per hour, the vehicle will detonate on sight. It turns up to be a cat and mouse game for Travers as he gets on the bus and tries to figure out how to dismantle the bomb and figure out how Payne knows everything in advance.What makes ""Speed"" such a fantastic movie besides the action scenes include it's top cast. No longer do we need action heroes like Stallone or Arnold to show their huge muscles where we have young talented actors like Keanu Reeves proving that he can flex his acting abilities besides being in Bill and Ted. Dennis Hopper is one mad S.O.B., in which his character has more smarts and surprises than any villain I had seen in 1994. Sandra Bullock plays Annie, one of the bus passengers, who would later be a successful actress in the big screens.Truly, one of the best action pictures of the 1990's.",Speed
129,nickenchuggets,"""If the bus blows up, he wins""",8,8 October 2021,"I remember seeing pieces of this movie on television over a decade ago, and spent quite a lot of time trying to find out what it was called so I could watch it. I guess searching google for a movie where the plot is based around a bus that has a bomb on it didn't cross my mind. Like many other films produced in the 90s, Speed is mostly non-stop action and sufficient (but nothing more than that) in the storyline department. It still does have a villain with a motive which makes him believable, but nothing too original. The movie begins with a psychopath on a certain floor of an unidentified building. It's a place that is for use by authorized personnel only, and when someone confronts the guy and tells him to get lost, he pays with his life. The psycho in question is Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper), a former cop who demands the people who used to be his allies give him 3 million dollars. Payne comes face to face with Los Angeles cops Harry and his squad mate Jack (Keanu Reeves), and nearly kills the latter with a shotgun after he drops into an elevator Payne is hiding in. Payne manages to get away, but shortly after blows himself up in a suicide attack (or so it seems). While Jack and his friend celebrate their apparent victory, a city bus explodes violently the day after. Jack now realizes the sickening situation he's in and is filled with dread. Payne didn't actually die, and actually takes time out of his day to call Jack on a payphone. He tells him he's added more money to his ransom and has additionally planted an explosive device on another bus heading toward a different part of the city. The bomb is set to explode once the bus in question dips below 50 mph, and will arm itself automatically upon reaching that speed. After hijacking someone's car out of necessity, Jack manages to catch up with the bus and tells the driver to drive straight and parallel to him so he can get on. Unfortunately, 50 miles an hour has already been reached by now, so the bus has to keep itself above this speed. As Jack explains what's going on to the passengers, someone on board threatens to shoot him for being a cop, but accidentally hits the driver instead. Meanwhile, a woman named Annie (Sandra Bullock) takes the wheel so that Jack can read details pertaining to the bomb over the phone to Harry. The first few minutes of the bus ride are horrific. Not being able to slow down or crash into things (because that also takes speed away) begins to make everyone panic, and whoever is driving must have the fastest reflexes. Eventually, things get a little easier when a police helicopter arrives to guide the bus to a highway that has absolutely no cars on it. Jack receives another taunting phone call from Payne, who tells him if anyone tries to leave the bus he will explode it immediately. Payne does allow the wounded driver to be offloaded from the bus to show everyone he's not a complete sociopath. Right after the driver is gone, the helicopter tells Jack that for whatever reason, part of the freeway is unfinished, and there is a large gap about 50 feet wide that the bus will be forced to jump. In a display of superb automotive ability, Annie manages to push the vehicle to its limits and clear the abyss. Even though everyone is still stuck on a bus with a bomb on it, the worst is behind them. The bus is driven to an airport and ordered to keep circling its empty runways. Despite having no more cars to worry about crashing into, Jack is not out of trouble yet. He tries one last time to get rid of the bomb, laying underneath the bus on a sled pulled by a tow truck, but damages the vehicle's gas tank. With the bus rapidly losing fuel, Jack arranges for all the passengers to be offloaded, but not before using a piece of looped camera footage to fool Payne into thinking everyone is still onboard. The bus explodes (with nobody onboard), but Payne realizes this too late. Now aware the police are searching for him, he kidnaps Annie and threatens Jack in a subway station while holding a detonator. After breaking into a vault to retrieve what's ""rightfully"" his, Payne boards a subway and shoots the driver dead. Jack is right behind him. After discovering Jack is on top of the subway while its moving, Payne climbs up there to fight him one on one. It looks as though this will be the end for Jack, but Payne reacts too slowly to an incoming train signal and is beheaded. With his enemy dead, Jack returns to the subway car to see Annie, but can't stop the train since the bullets damaged its controls. The train crashes, but this is Jack we're talking about, and it'll take more than that to kill him. The movie ends with the subway smashing onto a street from underground, with Jack and Annie still intact. While it may sound like a complex movie with a lot of plot points, Speed has a very simple premise. It's not the best written movie I've seen, but is good for some suspenseful action that keeps you on the edge the whole time. You really do get the feeling Hopper is going to destroy the bus at any moment even though he said he wouldn't because he's that mentally unstable. The problem is, the suspense only works for the first viewing, since every time after that, you already know what will happen next. This means this is one of those movies you can see multiple times, but it will never be as good as the first time you saw it. Still, this is one of the best action movies I've seen yet, since the villain is not just a mindless killer. The desire for huge amounts of money is mostly a tired excuse to do evil things, but like I said, scriptwriting is not the strong suit of this type of film. It feels like it was made just to enjoy, no matter how ridiculous or unrealistic it is. It's not really a movie meant to be taken seriously, even though it could potentially happen. Being stuck on a vehicle that is forced to go above a pretty fast speed must be a horrible experience.",Speed

That being said, this movie is a true testament to that. Featuring young Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock ( this was her breakthrough role, and some people even today view her through this role) on a bus that can't drop below 50 miles per hour, or it will explode, you have a great concept. What you get from that concept is a 1 hour of pure action and that 90-s movie chemistry between the characters (especially between Keanu and Sandra) followed by negotiations with the bomber. It's a real blast (no pun intended) from the past, and with that said, you can easily overlook it's little flaws and unrealistic scenes. It's such a joy to watch and fills your heart with warmness, so it should be appreciated for that. Not a lot of movies today pull that off. 8.5/10 from me, and a warm recommendation!

134,chrisbrown6453,"If nothing else, Speed does live up to its title.",7,19 June 2002,"It moves along faster than a speeding bullet, rarely slowing to take a breath, or for that matter, to develop its characters. How nice to see a pumped-up Keanu Reeves in a contemporary part once again. We've patiently endured his attempts at Shakespeare, his now-you-hear-it-now-you-don't British accent in Victorian-set Dracula, and his quirky surfer-esque Ted Theodore Logan from Bill and Ted fame. In Speed, he has only to speak the simplest of lines while jumping from speeding cars to speeding buses, evacuating bomb-rigged elevators and climbing atop a whizzing subway train. Mr. Reeves does all of the above with surprising style, in what unbeknownst to him, would be his audition for a little film titled The Matrix. Our unexpected action hero plays Jack Traven, a member of the LAPD SWAT squad. Jack has his hands full with Howard Payne, a disgruntled former-cop-turned-mad-bomber. As the demented blast-happy Payne, they cast Dennis Hopper. Now that's a stretch. Villainous Hopper does everything but twirl a mustache and tie the heroine to the tracks as he plants explosives from Santa Monica to LAX for revenge and reward. Most of the movie takes place on a city bus that has been rigged to explode if it slows to less than 50 mph Now, really! When was the last time you were able to travel at 50 mph-plus for any length of time in Los Angeles traffic? On public transportation? Needless to say, Speed has some gaping lapses in logic plenty big enough to drive a bus through, but it does deliver on the mechanical, visceral thrills and on the quotient of daredevil stunts per minute. Sandra Bullock, Keanu's love interest, gets off some snappy one-liners, though the scriptwriters have not bothered to provide her with a character. She spends most of the movie driving that huge bomb of a bus around in circles, through traffic jams and over chasms in the freeway. We do learn that her driver's license has been suspended for speeding, but otherwise no mention is made of her life, though one would guess that she spends a lot of time at the gym.",Speed
135,DavidSim240183,"A thrilling, high speed chase that crashes and burns in the final act.",8,20 October 2006,"Speed is a film that owes a debt to the classic disaster tales of the 1970s. People who found themselves at the mercy of situations beyond their control. The central conceit to Speed is quite simple. A mad bomber (hammily played by Dennis Hopper) rigs a bus to explode if it should drop below 50mph. It's quite an easy concept to digest which is what makes the film so easy to enjoy.LAPD cop Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) has the unenviable task of saving the passengers on their runaway bus. And it's an uphill struggle to say the least. Caught in the rush hour, the bus has to dodge cars, traffic jams, freeway gaps and petrol leaks all while it's in continual motion.Speed may be a bit thin on the ground plot-wise. At it's most basic level, it's just a series of escalating obstacles and pile-ups just to keep the film going. But it is genuinely exhilarating, and the pace never flags.Keanu Reeves is typically wooden but he's in his element. Speed was the film that catapulted Sandra Bullock to stardom. Something she deserved, because she runs rings around everyone else. Bullock makes her character, Annie into an admirably feisty heroine, who has to drive the bus around LA's highways, while at the same time shooting off wisecracks every two minutes. The low-key attraction between Jack and Annie is effective without ever dragging the film down.Bullock almost singlehanded keeps the film afloat during Speed's more fragile moments. Some of the obstacles the bus encounters are very contrived, like the gap in the road. When the bus has to clear it, it's an exhilarating piece of stunt work, but there's no way it could ever happen in real life. Sometimes in films like this, you have to turn a blind eye to logic.Speed is remarkably assured throughout most of the running time, considering the scant material to work with. But a tight script makes the film more fun then it has a right to be. There are still some glaring plot holes though. Like why Jack never noticed the camera on the bus earlier.But then, once the bus blows up, the film dies on it's feet. Switching the action to a subway train, the film steps very wrong, and becomes laughable to the point of stupidity. And it even contrives another obstacle in the same vein as the freeway gap. The track isn't finished. Give me a break! Watch Collateral and see how the ending could (and should) have been.Shame that Speed goes right off the tracks at the end, because it ruins what was a very suspenseful, exciting adventure. Oh well, fun while it lasted, and at least it's better than the dreadful Speed 2. Not even Sandra Bullock could save that one!",Speed
136,Cinemaniac1984,Get ready for rush hour.,8,8 February 2015,"Speed is an excellent, fast moving action blockbuster from start to finish. Keanu Reeves is excellent as the heroic SWAT officer Jack Traven, Dennis Hopper is never better as the mad bomber Howard Payne, and Sandra Bullock establishes herself as a great actress here. Other cast members including Jeff Daniels (in an unusual casting) as Jack's partner Harry Temple and Joe Morton (Miles Dyson from Terminator 2) is SWAT Lieutenant ""Mac"" McMahon.For those that have been living under a rock for the past 20 years, Speed is about a Los Angeles bus that is rigged to explode if it drops below 50 miles per hour (that's 80 km per hour). The movie starts with Howard Payne's attempt to trap an elevator full of people in an office building with the intention to hold them to ransom. Howard's efforts are successfully thwarted by LAPD SWAT officers Jack Traven and Harry Temple, in which Howard is seemingly blown up. A while later, one morning a bus explodes which is later revealed to be Howard Payne, who is still alive. He phones Jack Traven to tell him that a second bus has been rigged with a bomb. Once the bus hits 50 mph, the bus is armed. If it drops below 50 mph, the bus will explode along with all the passengers on board the bus. Howard also warns Jack that if any attempt to rescue the passengers is made, the bus will also be manually detonated. Jack manages to locate the bus and successfully boards it mid transit. While the bus continues to maintain its speed through the streets of Los Angeles, Jack must also race against time to successfully disarm the bomb, save the passengers on the bus, and outwit the psychotic Howard Payne, who is also revealed to be a ex-cop from the Atlanta Police Bomb Squad.The entire movie is very neat. Jan DeBont, who was previously a cinematographer for Die Hard, The Hunt for Red October, and Lethal Weapon 3, makes his directorial debut with Speed. Though he goes onto direct the 1996 blockbuster Twister, he doesn't hit the same heights with his next movies all box office flops. Believe it or not, following the success of Speed, everybody thought it was a great idea to follow up with Speed 2. As it turns out, Speed 2: Cruise Control (1997) which Keanu Reeves wisely passed on, turned out to be a bomb which sank at the box office and killed Jan DeBont's career as a director.Though you might found yourself questioning as to whether a bus can fly in a famous scene, among other things, forget about it and settle back and enjoy the fun.

No-one is trying to destroy the world, we just have an old fashioned psycho who wants revenge. Dennis Hopper plays an ex bomb disposal guy who was chucked out of the force, and believes he deserves due payment. When his plan is stopped by Reeves, a reckless cop, and Bridges, his calm partner, Hopper decides to put Reeves through a series of tests. He puts a bomb on a bus, which will be armed if it goes above a certain speed, and then detonated if it goes below 50. Reeves begins a race to find the bus, stop the bomb, save the innocents and find the bad guy. On the bus he meets Sandra Bullock, Annie, who has to take over driving the bus when the driver is shot. They form a partnership and try to find the bad guy.It is clearly the stunts that are the selling point for the film, and they are superb. The action is directed well, and the good guys never seem to get a break, with every situation scraped through narrowly. Reeves is good, Bullock sparkles in her first big role, and Hopper does the mad thing brilliantly. The rest of the cast all perform well also. many memorable moments, and lots of fun, with a plot full of humour and tension.",Speed

'Speed' is a movie that is held very dear to many action fan's hearts for many years. I've been dodging watching it for a while but I've finally cracked and gave into my curiosity. And my opinion of the movie? I liked it. It was a fun action movie with an EXCELLENT premise and cool ideas. As a full package, I can definitely recommend it. So what can I say are the film's main strengths? The overall tone and atmosphere is probably its' greatest strength. Considering the situation, the tone is pretty light-hearted but all the characters take it seriously. I guess that's what I loved about it. The juxtaposition of the tone of dialogue compared to the tone of the characters. It makes the movie undeniably fun to see Keanu Reeves perform with such sincerity and seriousness when in reality, it's just a dumb action flick. That leads onto another praise I can give: the passengers aboard the bus. I loved pretty much every main side character who was on this bus, with the exception of our two leads.Another major praise I can give the movie Dennis Hopper's villain. Howard Payne is a good movie villain. He's smart, he's pretty funny, he's conniving and he is remorseless. Alone these qualities may seem random, but when combined they make a truly interesting villain. Top that with Dennis Hopper's excellent performance and you have a pretty darn good antagonist.I also absolutely love the score for this movie. This falls into the category of minor praise but it really deserves to get a full paragraph for it. Mark Mancina's EXCELLENT score for this movie is ridiculously fun and inventive and entertaining. It is arguably one of the better action movie themes of the 90s. It's just such an adernaline fuelled score that fits perfectly with the overall tone of the movie.But what issues do I have? Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are two on the most dull actors on this planet. Don't get me wrong: Reeves is an EXCELLENT action star and I truly admire his commitment to the role. But I've seen school plays with more realistic and emotional performances. He's awful in pretty much every movie he is in. And then there is Sandra Bullock. To be fair, Bullock isn't an awful actress. But her performance in this movie is so unconvincing and so dry that I thought that Reeves had infected her with his disease. Combine the mediocre acting with a forced and botched love story and very underdeveloped characters, and you have a pair of leads that are an actual chore to sit through.My other main issue is the final act. It's just so over the top. And I usually wouldn't mind that but I don't think this drastic change in pace suited the overall movie. It was an action movie but it was a more of a slow burn action movie. This final act was just really dumb and didn't fit in tone with the movie. I was thoroughly disappointed with this movie's conclusion; it was such a mess.Overall, I did like 'Speed' though. It's certainly a fun and entertaining action movie, but the last act and two lead characters make it a chore to sit through, towards the end. Despite this grievances, I do recommend you watch 'Speed'. The action is mostly alright and the tone is pretty much perfect; it's a very enjoyable movie. I'll rate 'Speed' 7 'CANS' out of 10!",Speed
146,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,The blueprint for the 90's action blockbuster,9,29 March 2021,"THEE blueprint and standard for the explosive 90's action blockbuster. My first revisit since probably 1995. I had zero recollection of Jeff Daniels being in it. I can't believe he played TWO Harry's in the same year. Oh, and I had no idea that the primary action music from Metal Gear Solid was such a blatant ripoff of the primary action music from this movie until this rewatch - it's REALLY blatant. The movie is just as cheesy as you'd imagine it, AND just as entertaining. Honestly, Sandra Bullock steals the show. She is so likable, so endearing that it's actually insane. Keanu is peak Keanu - it's amazing. Hopper is pretty much phoning it in but it's hilarious and works, regardless. Everyone else on the bus is perfect. I also had no memory of the SPARKLE MOTION LADY from Donnie Darko being in this, especially not what happens with her character - quite a staple moment, to be honest.

147,kdnor2011,One of my favorite Action Movies,10,21 December 2012,"Speed is one of the greatest action movie's I've ever seen. And based on the premise it really shouldn't be, a bus, something that isn't very good in a chase, must stay above 50 miles per hour. Yet the way it's shot, the music, and making the characters likable enough to care about leads this to be one of the most heartpounding films I've ever seen. Every time I watch this film it gets me excited, and my heart begins pounding faster than usual. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock give very good performances, the effects are fantastic, and the villain is one of the funniest I've seen in any movie.It may be cheesy, but the only thing I really don't care about in the movie is the ending. And maybe this is just me, but I think the movie actually gives you too much, by the end, it becomes just exhausting. When the train is about to derail, I'm just like ""can the movie just end."" Other than that, Speed is one of the best action films ever made as far as I'm conscerened.",Speed
148,Rammstein-2,That's the way to do it,7,25 January 2001,"Speed is a top-notch action movie, energetic like few and incredibly fast-paced, funny at some points and with a fairly original plot. Stealing the show, Sandra Bullock and Dennis Hopper are really the main characters here, Keanu Reeves merely adds juice to the action - but he still performs very well, his usual wood-like appearance is eradicated by a clever story, quick turns and great visuals. ""Speed"" does a great job of adding something new to the abundant flora of action flicks. Too bad that its reputation had to bee tainted by the rock-bottom sequel.",Speed

151,HelenMary,"this film defines the ""action"" genre - it just doesn't let up!!!",8,5 December 2012,"I saw this film SO many times at the cinema as many of my friends wanted to see it and I loved seeing the reactions of people to all the ""shockers."" Of course I bought it, and watch it quite a lot, and it bears up to repeat viewing even when you know what is going to happen next. If you haven't seen it yet, where have you been? Reeves, Bullock, Hopper and Daniels are the key players in this and are superb. Reeves - Jack Traven - the hot hotshot SWAT guy (oh the uniform!) who's a bit gung-ho daredevil ""deeply nuts"" next to the brilliant Daniels - Harry Temple - calm and measured, very sensible partner, apparently the brains of the duo, Hopper - Howard Payne - is the bad guy - and that's not a spoiler, you find that out in the first ten seconds of film and he plays ""crazy not stupid"" wannabe 'eccentric'"" very well, and Bullock - Annie apparently has the surname Porter but I'm sure it's not mentioned in the film - the useful pretty suspended-license-passenger who drives the city bus and keeps it above 50! Great chemistry between Bullock and Reeves, and whilst you can see she's acting in places, she's a fabulous gentle foil for hard macho character and almost makes him see that people are frail as he's so used to throwing himself around. Amazing and poignant scene where Jack gives up for a short while, and she calms him... goosebumps. And more goosebumps later in the scene where he ""didn't have anywhere to be just then"" and doesn't leave her ...The action doesn't let up. Cinema-goers squealed, jumped and hid their faces through this one, and everything about it is simply great. This and Point Break made Keanu Reeves an acceptable household name for men as well as women, as no man could feel embarrassed liking a film in which a guy hangs under the chassis of a moving bus! This is definitely a boy film but lots of girls seem to like it too, can't think for the life of me why!! Jan De Bont's Direction was excellent. I'd call him visionary for having the ability to keep the action so fast paced and every little thing just frays your nerves. It's tight. I almost regret seeing the extras on the DVD - once you've see how they do a stunt it's not quite the same. Special mention has to go to the composer of the soundtrack too, that da da da da da daaa pumped the action forward and added to the frazzle-ness of feelings as you watched as it heightened your expectation.Despite all the action, there's unusually a really good script with some laugh out loud humour, great one-liners - who can forget Reeves' epic first line in this? ""The Basement!"" when he's still just the cocky-boy in the team, or the dialogue between Traven and Temple, ""Was it good for you?""... But the best line of the film has to go to Reeves' friend Rob Mailhouse (drummer in Dogstar), ""Bob, what button did you push?"" as most quoted! Great seeing Alan Ruck (Cameron - Ferris Bueller's Day Off) in this with some funny lines too.",Speed
152,mOVIemAN56,How every action film should be,8,5 December 2005,"Okay maybe every action film shouldn't follow the same plot but the spacing between action, yes. With a great cast Speed promises much and delivers a lot more. After an intense starting with the rescue of hostages from an elevator set to explode by terrorist Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper), Officer Jack Travern (Keaunu Reeves) and his partner Det. Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) are out to stop the same terrorist who has now planted several bombs aboard a city bus. Jack is able to board the bus with some difficulty and must take command of the situation immediately while Harry relays information to him from the office. As Jack tries to find a way to get the people of the bus, he is confronted with another problem. If the bus goes under 50 mph, the bus will explode. Taking the drivers seat after the bus driver is accidentally shot is Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) in the role that started her career. Now, along with Harry and the bus occupants, Jack must figure out a way to outsmart the terrorist and save the people aboard int his deadly cat-and-mouse game.Reeves is perfect for the role of Jack. He is smart, strong, and ever clever in his attempts to save people. Daniels creates the smart and ever reliable relief with a few words of caution and advice here and there. Even with Reeves and Daniels, Hoopers takes the cake as the best character, both in acting and in character. He's cunning, he's ingenious, and he is always ready with a smart remark. Unlike the Stephen Seagal films with every minute being filled with punches, shotgun blasts, and hand to hand combat, Speed is able to filter the action to when it is needed. The film is an action film but plays a lot on that of a thriller with buses speed always getting just close enough not to blow. The film works well and is one of the best action films out. With Reeves, Daniels, Hopper, and Bullock how could you go wrong?Speed. Starring: Keanu Reeves, Dennis Hopper, Jeff Daniels, and Sandra Bullock. 4 out of 5 Stars.",Speed

The opening starts with an explosion in an elevator shaft trapping 12 or so people alive.  If the mad bomber doesn't get 3 million dollars he blows the elevator.  Keanu Reeves and Jeff Daniels foil the mad bomber's (Dennis Hopper) plan but don't get away with him.  The next day, the bomber put a bomb on a bus that if it reaches 50 mph, the bomb is activated, and if it goes under 50 mph, it explodes.  The acting is generally perfect for all their characters, especially those on the bus.  Many people spit out very funny lines even when the event is bad. (Examples: ""Bob, what button did you push?)  That was funny.  The movie is also very smart showing what the good guy knows and the bad guy doesn't, vice verca.  The demise of the bomber is so smart and so funny, I just started to laugh.

Everything one expects of the genre is there for viewers to savor. From start to end, it fully embodies the word 'speed'. Director Jan de Bont keeps the film tightly structured through the use of crisp editing, and the inventive screenplay by Graham Yost allows tension to literally accelerate to top speed. The film builds up the suspense right from the office elevator sequence, and then it sucks viewers in like a whirlwind as the situation unfolds nail-bitingly on a speeding bus with a bomb.Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock show brilliant chemistry, and are well-cast for their respective roles. In fact, we as viewers, like them so much to the extent that we still fear for their lives on the umpteen viewing. Another reason Speed still stands the test of time is because the adrenaline induced is genuine, unlike the majority of action motion pictures that we get these days. Dennis Hopper is convincing as the terrorist, we hate him as much as we love the protagonists.De Bont shows mastery of the action-thriller genre with Speed (his first feature film). It's an exemplary example of focused film-making combined with an exhilarating storyline. Speed is a highly impressive motion picture that will always get on your nerves.

Remember that this movie was released in 1994 and it might not have the standard of good action movies of today, but it was great for its time.

Jack volunteers himself and Harry to examine the bomb which leads to them eventually saving the passengers and finding the bomber. After a confrontation, Jack and Harry think the bomber exploded and are awarded medals. However this ride has only just begun.After the explosion elevator opening sequence - which lasts upwards 10 minutes - Jack is sent into another game of Howard's as he's rigged a city bus with a bomb. But this one has a different catch than just explosion upon a button press. This one is armed when the bus exceeds 50mph and explodes when it drops below 50mph thereafter.Jack quickly finds a way to get on the bus after having to jump from a civilians's car to the bus. The bus driver gets shot and Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) must take over. But not aware of the bomb, she tries to slow down before Jack gives the reveal of the whole situation in front of all the passengers.Keanu Reeves gives probably the best performance of his career. Jeff Daniels supports really well, and Dennis Hopper is the classic bad guy. When it comes to the action, it is really amazing. You are on the edge of your seat the entire time because you don't know how in the hell they will keep the bus above 50.The score is wonderfully crafted and goes together very well. Joe Morton also supported really well and added depth to the plot when his big scene came up. He delivered all his lines with great emotion as well as mainly all the rest of the cast. Alan Ruck is a passenger providing comedic relief.The directing and a the script is all top notch and definitely dramatic when the action gets slow paced. No matter what, the tension is high and you can feel it throughout every character - except Annie.Three paragraphs and I still haven't discussed Sandra Bullock - I bet you wonder why. It should be fairly obvious that I despise her. Her acting is less than par level and her voice is dreadfully annoying. She is barely decent looking so it's hard to care for her at all. Her lines have no emotion as far as I can tell, which makes the Annie character pointless. The only reason why the driver was shot was to bring in this character. She quickly becomes romantically linked with Keanu's character. I just think the film would have done a lot better without her character. The only satisfaction I got from Sandra in this movie was her line: ""What you thought you needed another challenge or something?"" Sandra is the reason I refuse to give this a perfect 10. It is unfortunate that Forrest Gump, Interview With the Vampire, and Pulp Fiction came out the same year because Speed could have gotten more awards.Overall, the a-list actors, the incredibly intense ride the movie gives, the few laughs you have, the superb acting, the amazing plot, the dazzling special effects and props and the Oscar-Winning sound are all wonderful reasons to watch Speed at least once.",Speed

It keeps on going on and on and the tension never stops. With some great footage of Los Angeles and some stellar practical effects and explosions, this film is one of the quintessential 90s action movies.I also loved how the finale set on the Los Angeles underground metro was actually shot on an actual real L.A. subway train and was honest to god shot in the construction area of where the line extension to Universal City Hollywood North was actually being built at the time of filming, I also like how they actually used a LA Subway car for real to be destroyed at the end of the movie. That's some real LA Hollywood dedication right there.But apart from the amazing stunts and destruction, the film also has an intense opening act with an elevator rigged to explode which makes an extremely hooking first 20 minutes which pull you into the tension before the real segment of the film even begins. The first 20 minutes could be an action movie with a climax all on it's own before you even get into the real meat of the film.Keanu Reeves plays a great role in this movie which was almost made for him and he had a great likeable personality in the film along with Jeff Daniels and Sandra Bullock.

Sandra Bullock gives a star-making performance in one of her earliest performances as a bus passenger who, through bizarre circumstances, ends up driving the bus and keeping it at 50 MPH.This film provides riveting action and suspense from the beginning to the end, barely allowing the viewer to breathe as De Bont somehow tells this story on a pretty large canvas, yet gives us the claustrophobic feeling of being inside that bus at the same time.

178,Barky44,A Lesson in Making Excellent Action Movies,10,30 July 2005,"Speed is an excellent action movie. This is how action movies should be made. All producers of schlock ranging from Armageddon to National Treasure need to take a good, hard look at this film and learn something from it.The storyline from Speed is incredibly simple: madman threatens to blow things up if ransom isn't paid; law enforcement hero & co-workers try to stop him; innocent people in the mix throw in a wild card. The storyline is very simple and very linear and has virtually no complexity. And that is exactly what films like this require. They are action films, don't try to get all fancy with complicated plot lines. The audience wants to see stuff blow up, just get to it.The plot line is also believable. Sure, some of Speed's setups are pretty complicated (the elevator trick seems like an awful lot of work for a simple ransom gig). But overall it's written with great plausibility. The story has to be simple, but it also has to be believable, otherwise the audience is too busy laughing at the ludicrousness of it all to really get into the excitement of the film.The writing has to be crisp and to the point. There's not a lot of chatter in this film. This is an action movie, so dialogue is supposed to be short and sweet. No long discussions in a command center about what to do next, just think on your feet, bark orders out, make those snap decisions, and save all the small talk until later. Nothing ruins the pacing of an action film like laborious strategy discussions.The stunts have to be believable. Fans don't mind spectacular stunts, heck that's why we go to these movies! But the stunts can't be completely outrageous. Yes, the bus jump in Speed is outrageous, but the rest of the stuff is entirely plausible, and you can forgive one off-the-wall stunt. But most of Arnold's or Steven Segal's crap is so full of impossible stunts and crashes, they play like multi-million dollar episodes of CHiPS, where every highway crash involves cars doing cartwheels in the air...The actors have to be genuine. The best part of Keanu & Sandra's performances in Speed is they really play it with a high degree of believability. Keanu looks and acts like a hard-driven cop, too serious for his own good. Contrast that with his completely unbelievable performance as an undercover FBI agent in Point Break (a truly horrible movie). And Sandra plays it straight as a wise-ass woman who lost her license. She's not just a screaming bimbo but she also has a heart (as seen in the baby carriage scene). And the best part of these two stars? This film is not created as a star vehicle just for them, something you can't say of Nicholas Cage or Van Damme flicks.The action carries through the whole film. Some films (Bond films like to do this) have action then dialogue then action then love scenes then action then something else. If you're going to make an action flick then devise a way to have action through the whole thing. This film does just that, and without making it boring, either. Just when you think it can't get any worse for Our Heroes it does indeed, and that's good film-making.Other elements in this film are top-notch as well. The music is the perfect accompaniment to the story. The cinematography is not at all claustrophobic even though most of the action takes place on a bus. The special effects are seamless with the live action.

180,vasco_cid,Unparalleled fantastic action film.,10,3 May 2001,"Where can I start with? What makes me think that this movie is one of the best movies ever? So many things really acting, directing, script, tension, music and tons of action. But as James Bond would say: `First things first', Jan De Bont made his directorial debut in this film, what would be expected from a person with no experience in this matter was a lousy film, with story potential. But happened the opposite, the action scenes are so perfect that sometimes makes us think about nothing else and keep us in the edge of our seat every time we see it. Never leaving the extremely inventive plot behind, it is a movie that actually makes the actors show what they can really do, more than ever before. Sound and special effects were actually over the top and weren't showing us, that they were all that this movie had to give as many movies around show. Finally, I just want to call your attention to the fabulous score composed by Mark Mancina that is one of the best ever on movie industry and is one of the main factors that helps us feel so interested and affected by the movie's action scenes.I recommend this movie to everyone, no exaggeration, I give it a 9/10.",Speed

""Speed"" eventually is a fast ride that goes faster and faster.The situations become more dangerous and the finale involving the train is one of the most exciting.I enjoyed ""Speed"" a whole lot and Keanu Reeves makes a surprisingly great action hero.""Speed"" is one ride you will not want to get off of.",Speed

His acting is very solid and captivating, and he is very convincing as the bad guy. I especially like the part when he tell them about bombs. ""Bombs must blow, if they don't they're not bombs, they're gold watches."" That was cool.

Forget the fact that most of the time, they are obviously not driving 50 or above. Forget about the fact that the bus would not have made the jump. Forget the fact that we do not know if any people were on board the aircraft that the bus hit at the end. Maybe there were 200: I don't know, because the great kiss scene at the end admittedly grabbed my attention.Forget about the fact that Dennis Hopper (as Howard Payne) would have checked the bag of money as soon as he had collected it from the trash barrel, and that the marking dye would have exploded there.., not later, on the subway. forget about the fact that no marking dye would have been put in the bag, because the police would have realized that it would have triggered Payne to destroy the bus. Despite these maybe-forgivable unlikelihoods, this is a good action movie that kept my interest for the entire time, by use of various twists and turns in the plot, and by engendering concern and empathy for the characters. We honestly like the people on the bus, including Sandra Bullock (Annie), Keaneau Reeves (Jack) and Alan Ruck (Stephens). Jeff Daniels plays a very likable SWAT member, and Dennis Hopper plays the fully-functional madman so well, that alone is scary.The difficulty of the direction, stunts, and production of this movie must have been one incredible challenge after another. The elevator scene at the beginning of the movie is very exciting and well-done, and sets the tone for the movie.Inherent in Speed is the metaphor that society is ""running on the red line"" at all times, with an inability to slow itself down, and a fear that if it does, it will self-destruct. It will take a combination of us all pulling together at maximum effort, and a miracle, for us to finally get off the ""hamster wheel"" before the overlords realize what has happened. In kind of a cheesy way, this movie is a testament to how much good, or bad, one person can do. I hope the City of Los Angeles promptly compensated everyone for their damage and losses.",Speed

As i watched Speed, just now, I was irritated with how annoying Dennis Hopper's ""acting"" was. But also how dumb the writing was. Wow! But YES! Sandra Bullock was HOT in 1994! DAYUM! I can see why my Father liked her. Lol.Dumb writing. Yes! In the beginning, they barely realized the bomber was in a nearby elevator. I suspected it because of the remote trigger and because he needed to know what was happening in the elevator. I dont think he had a camera, so he had to be close. They barely realized this. Near the end, after they all get off the bus, Sexy sweaty Sandra Bullock was offering herself up like a sacrificial lamb for a lion. Why was she there?! Why was she at the drop zone?! Dumb writing!

He runs after the bus, chases it, they ignore him, speed up, get it over 50 KpH, and then the fun starts! There were so many heart-in-the-mouth scenes in it that it is hard to pick any as the best, but I think that little cunning trick with the camera was a mind-blowing one. I commend the film-makers for having come up with such an intelligent idea that literally sealed the deal, because throughout there was this question running in the mind as to how on earth will they be able to get out of it before it explodes.All in all, a complete entertainer, this film.

196,thespeos,I Really Want to Like this Film,7,25 June 2021,"I've tried watching this film 2-3 times, and I really want to like it.There are some excellent facets and movements to the story.The cast are all competent, and the scenes are (mostly) portrayed well.But some things just don't work, or work poorly.STORY:
On one hand, the story isn't particularly special. On the other, there are enough
twists in this puzzle to keep your mind and emotions pining for more. Sadly, there
are parts that aren't glued on right or simply fall apart. Example: Two elite SWAT
members have a ""mad bomber"" cornered, but instead of killing him ... they become
his hostage. What!?I have a pet peeve; no, a really big peeve, and that's where cops with guns in movies
yell ""Freeze!"" or ""Put down your weapon!,"" and so on. But, they don't actually shoot
(watch X-Files series and you'll understand). There's a scene early in this film that's
a crying example of this, and it simply makes no sense. Again, a peeve.ACTING:
The acting is actually very good (though some of these actors are mad-for-TV, and
it shows). My chief complaint is there is near ZERO character development. The
title of this movie probably refers to the fact that it moves so quickly ... they don't
have time to develop characters. No, seriously, the ONLY character that gets fleshed
out is the antagonist! Everyone is just hacked and jacked cardboard cutouts. Ugh ...TEMPO:
Ha, ha, ha ... good heavens ... yeah, OK, it's fast paced.CINEMATOGRAPHY:
A decent job here, but what is the American obsession with blowing things up???What, are all adult American males closet pyromaniacs?DIRECTING:
Only a tiny tiny portion of the director's resume is as director, whereas the massive
bulk of his work is as cinematographer. This explains why this film is really about
providing a flurried diet of flashy visuals (and boom booms). Nearly everything the
writer has done is ... you guessed it, Made-for TV. (You see, this why a person's work
gives off its own odor that clues us as to their proclivities and talents. Watch, listen ...
and feel the film. Or as Jesus said ""Judge a tree by its fruit."")Overall, an OK film for those needing a caffeine fix (without the caffeine), or those who
have an attention span of a quark's life-cycle.",Speed

199,Captain Ed,"Some brain-dead spots, but exciting **SPOILERS**",6,25 February 2003,"""Speed"" features some exciting action and good acting, but it also features some scenery-chewing and script idiocy.  However, it's a good enough popcorn movie to entertain, as long as you know it's not terribly smart.First, the good: Sandra Bullock had a breakthrough role in this film and it's easy to see why.  Despite the testosterone overload of films in this genre, she comes across as both strong and vulnerable.  In fact, she's the one person in this movie besides Jeff Daniels that feels genuine and so the audience (male & female) can easily identify with her.  She does brave things but always because she has to do them, not because she's an idiot who wants to prove something.  Kudos to the writers and to Bullock, who glows onscreen here.Speaking of idiots proving something, Keanu Reeves and Dennis Hopper fall into that category.  Reeves lets it lay back, though, and that works more than Hopper's typical Snidely Whiplash-style villain, who at one point starts spewing a bunch of pseudo-philosophical nonsense about how the PD won't let the bomb ""become"".  Smack the writers and Hopper, and give Keanu credit for trying to overcome the material.The plot is laid out pretty well most of the way through, except for two glaring ""you've gotta be kidding me"" moments.  First, at one point the PD direct the bus -- which has to stay above 50 MPH -- onto the 105 freeway, which at the time had not opened yet, and then they're surprised when there's a section that hasn't been built.  Second, anyone familiar with the 105 freeway knows that even complete, it's a lousy choice for what they want; why not take the 405, which connects to the 5 on either end, giving you the option (going north) to get the hell out of LA?  Why not take the 10 and do the same thing? The 105 is only 25 or so miles long.  Third, and most egregious, there is NO WAY IN HELL a bus can leap the gap shown in the freeway, and even if it could (if, say, a ramp had been placed there, which it hadn't), it would never be able to maintain a wheel speed registering 50 MPH or above.  It's a simple law of physics.The second instance is the ending.  Having handcuffed Bullock onto a support rail in a subway car, and Reeves not having the handcuff keys, and the controls being shot to hell and the brakes not working (a very contrived situation), Reeves decides to save the day by speeding up so he'll disrail and smash into most of subterranean LA.  Huh???  Wouldn't slowing down to a minimum speed work very nicely?  I mean, all you need to do at that point is come to a stop without getting killed so someone can bring in a hacksaw, right?  The resultant crash is all very fun, but ultimately stupid.Anyway, like I said, it's a pretty good popcorn movie, and it's loads better than its sequel.  I gave it a 6 for entertainment value.",Speed
200,ray-280,The best picture of 1994,10,25 April 2008,"The film has not a single flaw, and a minimum of physics-defying stunts necessary to make the action film work. The bus is diverted to a place where it can (temporarily) survive, and the few leaps of faith (and more yards than a human can leap) are minimalistic plot devices, nothing more. This film is about the people caught in a suspenseful, yet survivable, crisis. This firlm is a THRILLER that demolishes its peers from its own era and rivals that of any era, and even that quaint little British serial about some over-the-top secret agent spty guy.Keanu Reeves (Jack ""I put the SWAT in SWAT"" Traven, LAPD SWAT) and Sandra Bullock (Annie Porter) could Just as easily have been Gable and Hepburn. Reeves is more cartoonish, but carries his ""supporting"" role well. The clear star of the film is Sandra Bullock, the grouchy, half-awake commuter grunt thrust behind the wheel of a bus that is rigged to explode if it slows down below 50 mph. Hitchcock would have been proud of the suspense, and special effects worthy of evolving his cro-duster scene from that era.While a complete film in the true sense of the word, the story never strays from its title premise. The desperation attempts to survive could fail at any time, and the passengers not only know this, but half of them seem to expect it, though they try as they can to survive. This film brought us an insider's video of those scenes we usually only read about or watch on the news, and gave us an oddball supporting cast of stereotypical LA and tourist types that made us feel like we were on the bus right with them, wishing the crisis was over so we could get to wherever we were going, and do what we were doing, without being bothered by high-level criminals using us as a pawn, and could they please get us off this damn bus?

206,matlefebvre20,Wild fun at 50 MPH and over!,9,9 September 2006,"Pop quiz, avid moviegoers. You're looking for a serious thrill ride without having to spend your last paycheck in its entirety. What do you do? Tell me what do you do? There are two possible answers: 1)You go to the mall and you buy ""Speed"" on VHS or DVD or 2)You rent ""Speed"" at your local video rental store.You're gonna tell me that these aren't the only possible answers, but I tell you that these are the best ones.One of the best action thrillers of the 90s (if not of all time), ""Speed"" never takes a moment to get its breath back and that's the reason why it's one of the great thrills of modern Hollywood.The story, for those who don't already know it, concerns a Los Angeles public bus on which a bomb has been placed by a cop-turned-terrorist (Dennis Hopper). The bomb will be armed when the bus goes over 50 MPH and it will blow up if the bus's speed drops below 50.The only hope for the unfortunate passengers is devil-may-care police officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves), who previously wrecked a plan from the same terrorist.To make such a ride and to throw away cheap introductions and conclusions, ""Speed"" has been scripted in order to put minor rides between the principal one. While the bus is the hamburger's meat, the two bread slices are an hijacked elevator and a runaway metro train. And the three parts of the story work well in their own way.Jan de Bont gets his first directorial effort here, after working as a cinematographer for movies like ""Die Hard"". Cinematography is one of the key elements of ""Speed"" and especially aboard the bus. The numerous camera angles and positions make the vehicle a pleasure to watch and almost becomes an entity.Also outstanding are the performances of the three main actors. Keanu Reeves is at his coolest as he plays Jack. Sandra Bullock, in her breakthrough role, is the most three-dimensional person of the lot and she is really fine as the bus' 'substitute driver'. However, Dennis Hopper is the finest character of all. His role as the former cop who wants money for ""revenge"" is menacing and maniacal. So, Hopper's performance is the best of his career, after Frank Booth in David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"".""Speed"" is dubbed as an action thriller, but it's more of a thriller than an action film. Or, if it's action, it could nearly be called 'unconventional'. Because there are no gunfights, a very short battle sequence (which ends very creepily) and while the vehicles run to full speed, there are absolutely no chases.What could be called action in this movie are Jack's attempts to enter inside the bus and his battle with Hopper on the top of the subway train.The movie mostly succeeds on its 'thriller' segments. We could count among them: the initial elevator rescue, Jack's attempts to stop the bus before it goes over 50 MPH (even if we know that he failed) and the numerous elements that happen during the bus trip, which include a rescue attempt, a big jump and a failed attempt to dismantle the bomb.It's perhaps the only modern movie where an odometer is the key element of the story...You wouldn't want to miss a single second from this astonishing tour de force by Jan de Bont, from the imaginative elevator title sequence to the final notes of Billy Idol's ""Speed"" (the title song) at the end of the credits.",Speed
207,eamon-hennedy,Fast paced (see what I did there?).,9,27 January 2004,"Sheer adrenalin from beginning to end, Speed is one hell of an action film, but it is one that is both simple, yet deviously complex. First of all, the plot is well done. It really is. It sound good on paper and writer Graham Yost (with a little help from Joss Whedon) takes full advantage of what might happen when stuck on a bus that has to stay above fifty miles per hour in order to stop from blowing up due to a mad bomber. Every obstacle that Keanu and Sandra could possibly face arises; children crossing the road, a woman with a baby carriage, a traffic jam, a hard right turn and of course, a big huge gap on the road. Logic is not only stretched, but it is thrown out of a very high window, but when a film is this much fun why complain.The script is very well set up, not only in terms of plot but in terms of structure. Each act has it's own set piece. Act one features the elevator sequence. Act two, the biggest act of the film takes place on the bus while the third and final act takes place on the train (a controversial contribution from Whedon and one that Yost was very unhappy with). Of course none of this would work without a great director at the helm and Jan de Bont rises to the challenge. While his career after this has been hit and miss (critics have slated his work but audiences have been forthcoming), here he shows that he has learned from being a director of photography for Paul Verhoeven and John McTiernan with a visual prowess and a handling of action sequences that is superb. In fact a lot of the film recalls Die Hard with the suspense arising from a plot that is quite simple yet deviously more complex in its execution. The biggest surprise at the time was that Keanu Reeves does wonderfully well in the role of the hero, Jack Tavern. He is charming, yet tough and while he doesn't really have to 'act' here, his performance is well done and he should be proud. Likewise Sandra Bullock in what is really her breakthrough role, even though it is her second major film after having been the female lead in Demolition Man. Her performance has all the hallmarks of her lovely girl next door act and her chemistry with Reeves works well. It is especially funny when he keeps calling her 'mam'.However the film is stolen from everyone's favorite psychopath Dennis Hopper. Brilliantly evil as Howard Payne, Hopper clearly enjoys playing a bad guy who enjoy being a terrorist (""the whim of a mad man, I like it""). While the role is not of the disturbing variety that Frank Booth is (this is a mainstream film after all), the role is great one and is instantly memorable, as is his death scene.If you have still to watch this film do. It is brilliant and is one of the best Hollywood action films of the nineties. Just don't watch the abysmal sequel.",Speed
208,lopcar1993,The best of the best!!,10,19 April 2009,"Speed is something we all love, I know I sure do, the feel of the car going fifty miles an hour you passing everyone by like they were turtles. People cursing you out and flicking you off as you swerve in and out of traffic like a mad man. But wait! There's a problem, your not driving some supped up sports car. Your driving a LosAngeles city bus that is rigged to blow if it drops below 50 M.P.H. then bus goes kaboom!! And you and everybody else inside are toast(or more like smoked meat, but you get the idea.) This is the problem L.A.P.D. detective Jack Traven has. He has to keep a bus full of people alive while trying not to drop below fifty,talk about a major adrenaline rush.Speed is nicknamed ""Die Hard ob a bus"", and to tell you the truth it is, Speed is an electrifying mix of adrenaline pushing action and heart stopping stunts, it's the kind of movie you walk into and know your just going to love it( how can't you?) this film is not meant to be Die Hard it's meant to be a film that rivals Die Hard, and right now it is still the only film that can rival it.Speed is not your ordinary action film it's one of the few with smarts, and plenty of it to go around this film throws out the smarts and action in perfect harmony, not many action films do that, and that is what makes this one so unique and original and so much fun to watch, Speed is the best action film when it comes to humor, intelligence's and most importantly Speed. It's a film you can watch over and over again and love every minute of it it truly is the top dog of action.",Speed
209,Mr_PCM,"High-paced, highly charged action",9,9 May 2005,"For sheer adrenaline, there's not a lot of films out there to top Speed. If released now this film might possibly be considered politically incorrect and sensitive (but then again, what isn't?) but its just a simple terrorism movie (although the 'terrorist' wants money, so probably not technically a terrorist).The main portion of the plot revolves around a bus which is armed with a bomb that will blow if the bus drops below 50 mph. Keanu Reeves is the cop on the bus, with Sandra Bullock driving the bus through the streets of LA at breakneck speed. Dennis Hopper plays the bad guy with a mix of wise-ass and psycho, to create a very effective villain, and Jeff Daniels is Keanu's partner on the ground (as it were).It sounds simple enough, but the simple idea is surprisingly effective, making for some genuine breath-holding, edge-of-your-seat moments. As with all Hollywood movies, you just know that a romance plot line is going to creep in somewhere, and Speed is no exception. But even though the romance is telegraphed from the moment Reeves gets on the bus, it doesn't detract too much from the story.It's not a particularly clever film, but it really doesn't need to be. Just sit back (if you can, if not just sit on the edge of your seat) and enjoy the ride.The worst thing about this film is, as successful as it was, it was always going to spawn a sequel, and spawn is definitely the right word. Speed 2: Cruise Control is an abomination which sullies this one. So do yourself a favour, watch this, but instead of watching the sequel, just watch this one again.",Speed
210,crowrobot,Enjoyable action ride...,8,11 July 2007,"'Speed' is a highly entertaining thriller made with loads of energy and style. It has a great cast, taut direction, and enjoyably outrageous stunts.LA cop Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) is a busy guy. Not long after foiling a hostage situation involving former Atlanta cop Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) and an elevator full of victims, Jack is pulled into Payne's new scheme, the now-famous 'bomb-on-a-bus' situation. After the driver is accidentally shot by one of the passengers, a woman named Annie (Sandra Bullock) takes over and must work with Jack to figure a way out.I have never thought Keanu Reeves is a bad actor; he's just a limited one. The problem with Reeves is that he is frequently miscast in romances when he's more at home in action flicks like this or 'The Matrix' or comedies like 'Bill and Ted'. Reeves is terrific here, focused and tough, although his delivery does occasionally mangle some good lines. I liked Reeves' and Bullock's chemistry, although the screenplay's attempts to make them fall in love are VERY forced. Hopper plays another one of his patented psychos spectacularly, while Jeff Daniels and Joe Morton play Jack's fellow cops. I also liked Alan Ruck (Cameron from 'Ferris Buller') as a nervous bus passenger who gets a great moment early on.The direction by Jan de Bont is relentless, only briefly stopping to let the audience catch their breath. The script is good too; as soon as one problem is solved, another surfaces, and you can't help but grin when Jack actually lowers himself under the bus to try and defuse the bomb.'Speed' may not be a classic, but it's still loads of fun.",Speed

Annie really steps up to the plate when a very scary situation calls for it.This movie is action-packed, and has sad as well as exciting moments.

213,johnm_001,Too Much Action?,10,13 October 2000,"If a film can suffer from too much action, then ""Speed"" is guilty of that. Otherwise, it is an almost flawlessly crafted action film, arguably without peer.  Reeves makes an excellent hero, and Bullock just about steals the film with her fun and gutsy character.  It starts off with a bang, and never lets up. Action films don't get better than this.",Speed
214,TimBoHannon,Come along for the ride!,8,14 March 2003,"Following an enjoyable business luncheon, several high-ranking employees get onto an elevator in a 40-floor building. Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper), who has wired the elevator's cables and emergency brakes with C4 explosives, sits in a freight elevator elsewhere in the building. After blowing the cables, Payne informs the police that unless 3 million dollars is paid to him in 60 minutes, he will detonate the brakes as well. Officers Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) and Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) are ordered to examine the bomb, and end up saving all of the elevator's passengers, thwarting Payne.Just days later, Payne contacts Traven. Howard has concocted a new game, and this time he wants 3.7 million. A Los Angeles city bus has been wired with a bomb that will arm itself when the bus reaches 50 miles per hour. Once it falls below that speed, the bomb will detonate. If there is any attempt to evacuate, Payne will detonate the explosive remotely.""Speed"" is without a doubt one of the truly great action films of the 90s. It is grandly suspenseful and sucks the viewer in for one thrilling ride. The aggressive soundtrack is superb, as is Jan De Bont's directing. From the elevator job, to the scene of the rogue bus hurtling through the streets of LA, to the phone dialogue between Payne and Traven, to the awesome climax, ""Speed"" remains true to its hypertension-inducing form.In a similar manner, the movie presents the effect of the crisis on the innocent hostages. It presents them as normal, everyday people thrust into an extreme situation. Sandra Bullock delivers her usual strong performance as a commuter who ends up driving the rigged bus. She is the only passenger who is not one-dimensional, but even with the others frozen in their simple roles, we feel like we are on the bus with them. This creates an ideal atmosphere to tell the story in.As the lead, Keanu Reeves performs well in all facets of his role. He comes across as a complex person whose different strengths and personal qualities come into play in the various situations he encounters. His acting talent is often called into question, but his portrayal here is strong and leaves me wondering why so many are hard on him.As the antagonist, Dennis Hopper comes through with possibly the top performance of his celebrated career. It is hard to imagine anybody else playing his part at the same level. Payne is one of the most potent villains I have ever seen. He is a brilliant and well-prepared man. Howard Payne trails only Elliot Carver for villain of the decade.All of these ingredients add up to an outstanding film worthy of multiples viewings. From exceptional stunts and pyrotechnics to the intense plot, ""Speed"" appeals to all categories of action fans. ""Speed"" will treat the viewer to a capital thrill. It not as good as they say. It is better.",Speed

217,~AleXa~,My all-time favorite movie,10,4 December 1999,"This movie was awesome! It has a very suspenseful plot, good characters, and excellent special effects. To sum up, Annie (Sandra) is your average working gal, who happens to take the bus on the most inopportune day-the day a bomb is planted on it. This bomb was planted by a terrorist who was attempting to get back at an LAPD cop named Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) because Jack had screwed up his scheme to blow up about 8 people trapped on an elevator. The terrorist tells Jack which bus has the bomb and he gets aboard the bus, when a Hispanic guy freaks out and shoots the driver in the shoulder, causing Annie to become the driver. This is how Jack and Annie meet. They travel all over L.A., as the bus has to stay over 50 mph or it will explode. Jack pulls some pretty daring stunts in an attempt to save the passengers of the bus. Again, this movie has a terrific plot and I honestly think that you would really enjoy this movie.VERDICT: Awesome action movie with a little bit of everything, not to mention two of my favorite people--Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves. HIGHLY recommended to everyone.***More descriptive edit coming soon***",Speed
218,LagerLagerLagerShouting,Yea Yea Alright...Oh!,6,30 April 2008,"One of the more original efforts to the 90's action canon, Speed is mindless adrenaline fuelled entertainment but one which would have benefited from being shorter. The primary centre of the narrative is the bus, so when you have most of the film dedicated to this tense scenario the characters are enveloped in, it feels like a bit of a cope-out when they rush the belated rescue from this situation by focusing instead on a pretty ridiculous ending on a subway train. Concentrate on the bus for crying out loud! Anyway, the action is great, if unfathomable and Hopper makes a great villain again. But although, in this case, the premise was good on paper, as usual with the 90's action flick the script in worn, cliché (apart from some occasional good one-liners), contains your stereotypical characters and has big enough plot holes to drive a 50mph bus through.6/10",Speed
219,ty-jensen,Action classic!,10,23 June 2021,"Speed was honestly my first Keanu Reeves movie and one of my first R rated movies. I first seen Speed back in 1995 so I was only six, I guess a lot of young kids seen Speed since it's a soft R. I loved Speed when I was a kid and I love it more as an adult.The acting is good including Keanu Reeves but not everyone agrees. Speed was the movie which made Reeves and Sandra Bullock huge stars. They worked together again in The Glass House which I couldn't get into. Jeff Daniels plays Reeves' partner, coincidently he has the same name as his Dumb & Dumber character. Dennis Hopper plays the villain, he passed away back in 2010 from prostate cancer.Speed is cheesy but not overly cheesy. The film has some serious moments and the crisis is naturally treated seriously. The film is mindless but it doesn't go too far despite the absurd premise. The humor works, I chuckled several times.The action is great which is mostly the bus speeding. The action was done for real since this was before CGI was overused. Bullock feels Speed is mostly a thriller and I understand why. Speed is suspenseful since the ride is very dangerous.Overall, Speed is another fun action movie. If you consider it a thriller, that's fine. Speed is cheesy and ridiculous like most 90s movies. Unlike Point Break, Speed is a soft R so kids can see it. If you like the leads, you should see Speed at least once.",Speed

I love Keanu Reeves too, he is gorgeous, and after seeing them together in that wonderful movie The Lake House I was very pleased to find them together again in this movie. I see Speed 2 isn't rated highly, although I enjoyed it very much and am surprised it didn't gain more praise. Probably Reeves felt it was to much more of the same?

222,ChrisTreborn,"The only "" Over the EDGE "" movie Ever Happened",8,16 June 2005,"Those mid 90's, that were the time I became a Hollywood action movie fan. I saw this film in my video recorder first, but it blew me out even in that small screen. I wondered what could have I experienced if I seen it on the silver screen. At that time I have seen lot of action movies that fascinated me, excited me but this movie stands alone from them for its unique transversal versatility.Speed (Spoilers******) After the box-office disaster of Arnold's ""Last Action Hero"" major studios were thinking Hollywood Action Movie Era has ended, making Paramount pictures to switch off from the 'Bomb Squad Action Thriller'. But 20th Century Fox takes their own risk to change that equation by hiring a foreign film director.Director Jan de Bont brings the new defined version of thriller action with a different tone. He got tight script, good studio, great crew and fine actors for his cinematic experience. Story of a young officer Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves) who got twisted with his new arch enemy Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper), an ex-bomb squad officer whose plane was once demolished by Traven. In his second chance Howard tantalize Traven by telling the next attack was targeted on a bus, and the bomb will set when it speeds greater than 50 mph. What will he do next, will he track down the mad bomber or does he save the civilians? Written by Graham Yost, enhanced by Joss Whedon, tells the exciting paced venture thriller. The screenplay was well written, strong and fixed, the director just gave the perfect visualization for story.All credits goes to the production team, from the principal photography team under Andrzej Bartkowiak to the editing works of John Wright, everything was perfect for this movie experience. Plus the soul of the movie, the music created by Mark Mancina and John Van Tongeren was masterful for this chapter. Without Mancina's theme I don't think the movie could have been that successful, it was so punching, pulse pounding. And the actors, Keanu Reeves-the real life 'Neo', he showed his first matured manly portrayal in this movie, and Sandra Bullock relay smooths this intense film with her presence. And also Joe Morton, how can I miss him, it was one of his greatest roles after T2: Judgment day's 'Miles Dyson'. The major miss was from Dennis Hopper and Jeff Daniels, one was misused and other was wasted respectively.All in all it's a wonderful extreme movie that an action loving male like me must not miss.Speed = The Deep.",Speed
223,crash21,A classic joke,2,9 March 2009,"I roll my eyes so many times watching this, I see more of the ceiling than the movie screen. There are so many flaws in this movie's story, I don't know where to begin...First in someone's car he tries to tell the bus there is a bomb on board on the bus, right there, why couldn't the police have contacted the bus through the contact radio? So he has to do a chaotic scene to get onto the bus? That scene is laughable right there.Then the most famous scene in Speed, is the biggest joke; when they jump the unfinished part in the road, wouldn't they just drop down through the hole? Or bang into the other side of the road? Also, why does the bus even have to jump the gap in the road when there were numerous exits before it? (like the exit the bomb squad took). And when the bus is circling the airport runway (with tires taken out by the entrance's spike strip), they can hardly keep the little cart Keanu Reeves is riding under the bus stable, yet, the bus turns round and round, with his cart following flawlessly, plus this somehow has to lead to him poking a hole in the bus gas tank.I also love the last action scene in Speed. This movie was so over dramatized, that all the drama with the bus wasn't even enough, they had to put the characters together on a failed subway car as well. First of all, the subway car wouldn't be running on a track that is still under construction. The scene where they are just crawling on a fast subway car is just a joke, and second, with the failed brake, why couldn't they just shut the engine off and let the car roll to a stop? (instead of having to jump the track) They can speed it up, why can't they just slow it down?Speed is all about ridiculous, over dramatized action, and definitely not logic. For crying out loud, Arnold Schwarzenegger movies are more believable than Speed!",Speed

It was the kind of movie that just gets made once. When we rented this, I had to choose between Speed or that Pauly Shore movie In the Army Now. I'm really glad I chose Speed. It has one of the best plots ever. A bus that will blow up if it goes slower than 50 m.p.h.?!?! Timeless!!! It doesn't even stop there. It ends up going all the way to the subway in a great climactic showdown between Keanu Reeves and the great Dennis Hopper in his best role. He does the psycho role so good that it's creepy. I wouldn't even like action movies if this wasn't made. The only thing wrong is the mess ups. There's a lot. Sandra Bullock was another great thing. In some action movies, they try to show off a sexy lead by a sex scene like in True Lies or The Specialist. That draws your mind away from the action. I don't like that.

226,sullibrandon,Blazing Fast Entertainment,9,1 June 2006,"When it hit theatres in 1994, Speed was a rocket powered entertainment vehicle that was guaranteed to keep viewers on the edge of their seats the whole time, barely letting up the entire way as Keanu and/or the bus performed one death-defying stunt after another. 12 years later, Speed has lost none of its quality, and still succeeds in giving solid chills and thrills for a good hour and fifty minutes.The film opens with Keanu Reeves and Jeff Daniels attempting to rescue a group of hostages who are trapped in an elevator that could go off at any second, due to a crazed man who is holding them in the elevator for ransom (Dennis Hopper in a brilliant turn as Howard Payne). Needless to say, Reeves (Jack) and Daniels (Harry) succeed and (apparently) dispatch the bad guy to oblivion. Months later, though, Jack must combat his old nemesis when a bus is wired to explode if it goes below 50 miles per hour.Forget logic. Forget reason. Speed is that rare, liberating experience that actually succeeds in making you not care whether something makes sense. Reeves can ram a subway into a wall and not die, go climbing around in the undercarriage of a bus, and come out virtually completely unscathed. Speed succeeds in virtually everything in sets out to do, which, thankfully, is not much.The filmmakers never have any illusions that they are making this a character driven drama that will have you weeping if one of the characters dies. Thought some characterization is added, it is definitely secondary to the action. All its purpose is to do is to that you care at least a little bit for the main character and what happens to him and his romantic opposite: Annie, played by Sandra Bullock. Though normally, lack of characterization might be classified as bad, Speed is the rare exception to the rule: the rare movie that comes along at just the right time, and blends just enough action and characterization to make you say, ""Forget those people! Let's get to the good stuff!"" And believe me, the ""stuff"" is good. Mind-blowingly so. With movies out now like The Matrix, Equilibrium, the new Star Wars, and other action-packed films, you would think Speed would lose some of its impact. Not true. Years later, it still has that special something that sets it apart from all other action films. The action is creative, never-the same, constant, tense, taut, and thrilling. A good musical score en-chances the action as well. Dennis Hopper's acting is just the tiniest bit cheesy, but that works for the film. Reeves is his usual dumbed-down action hero, and it fits the part of Jack perfectly. Daniels shows a refreshing bit of his dramatic side, and Bullock captures just enough chemistry with Reeves to make it believable.Speed will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time, with unbelievably tense and amazing action. It never once takes itself too seriously. It is conscious of its own cheese, and fully embraces it, finding the perfect balance of cheese and gravitas. Explosions, a blazing fast bus, and a speeding subway train. What more could one ask for?",Speed

230,KaZenPhi,Aged exceptionally well,8,6 August 2018,"It's interesting to revisit movies I've seen a lot as a child either on grainy VHS or on tiny TV sets in their full splendor on recent HD releases. For a fan of movies this is one of the best possible future dystopias. The landscape of action cinema has changed dramatically in the last 20 to 30 years. With the dominance of comic book movies there are a lot more movies with action in them but fewer films that I would actually call action movies, ie where action has a meaning, drives the plot and the emotional connection with the audience forward and has a palpable danger that keeps you on the edge of your seat. In a lot of big modern movies the action lacks weight, both physically and emotionally, a notable if rare exception being Mad Max Fury Road. Furthermore they fail to tell action with a keen sense of the visual language of cinema. The late eighties to mid nineties gave us a few classics that might not have been smart movies but were made in incredibly smart ways, like the first die hard, terminator 2 or speed. Despite being completely dissimilar they share a few key elements that make them stand the test of time. The most important element being rhythm. Much like a musical piece there's tension and relaxation and exciting action doesn't work without build-up and the investment of the audience. This also translates into the visuals as well. It is much more evident in the golden age of Hong Kong action in the eighties, where the fight movies can be registered as elaborately choreographed dance moves, but Hollywood action used to share this strength albeit done with different props. For people who only watch movies and have never worked in the medium itself this may sound strange or unbelievable but a movie constantly leads the attention of your eyes from one point to another, much like a stage magician, and composing an image, especially one in motion is a tough challenge. So even movies that noone would call art because of their banal content can be serious pieces of art if you ask me.Speaking of which the premise of Speed is simple and genius for a thriller (although not entirely original since it was already done in a similar fashion in the japanese movie ""shinkansen"" decades before) it's almost a parody. If you were to scribble out the set-pieces for someone who hasn't seen the movie it would sound like the most absurd trash imaginable, however the language or should I say magic of cinema makes it work and Jan DeBont sells it to you piece by piece, much like John McTiernan and James Cameron did in their prime. What surprised me most about Speed upon revisiting it after many years is how gorgeously it is shot. DeBont's main strength as a cinematographer is showing strongly and fortunately it's not just eye-candy as the bone and grisl of the action is captured perfectly. There was some serious thought put into how to tell this movie visually that I miss in a lot of modern blockbusters. Think of a Tony Scott movie but less ridiculous. To be fair though 1995 would see the rise of Michael Bay, a vulgar plagiarist without taste and flair where every shot is so over-engineered and polished as to be absolutely meaningless. I can see how a parallel universe Speed may have looked like under his direction and I shudder. Not everything is shiny in retroland.As for the few negatives: Reeves (whom I honestly love as an actor) is a bit wooden, Dennis Hopper is hamming it up like crazy and despite the great presentation the finale goes a bit too much over the top and thus loses a lot of the believability that made the rest of the movie so exciting. A smaller scale would have been preferable here. Earlier in the film when we see Reeves just centimeters above the asphalt at breakneck speed we get a better sense of danger than can be achieved with the special effects shots of the ending.Still, a simple and entertaining movie that doesn't insult your intelligence, with relateable characters with enough nuance that they feel like people. Speed doesn't pretend to have a deep plot and lofty messages, it's just there to take you on a ride - and after being inundated with comic book movies good and bad the last ten years that simplicity and honesty is very refreshing.",Speed

232,DaRick89,An action movie which never goes below 50 miles an hour,10,22 January 2006,"Speed is an action movie which, like the bus affected, never lets up, always going at above 50 miles an hour. It is so fast-paced that mere minutes after receiving a medal, our hero Jack Traven is back in action, hopping on a bus with a bomb on it. This bus cannot go below 50 miles an hour otherwise it explodes, leading to one incredibly entertaining film. What this film does so well is grab your attention immediately, by having our villain stab a guy in the first minute or so of the film. In fact, I would go so far as to say that is one of the best action films I've seen in a long time and this is saying something considering that I only saw it last night and that I watch action films quite regularly. The plot is simple without being stupid, as some action film's plots are. It revolves around LAPD man Jack Traven, an extortionist who wants revenge on Jack and other innocents after Jack foiled his 'elevator job' and Annie, a passenger-turned-bus driver on a bus who had her license revoked for, whatd'ya know, speeding. This movie, like the back of the DVD cover suggests, also has some unexpected, surprising twists, making it all the more entertaining, because we do not really know what will happen up to the final, intense showdown, which fluctuates between victory and defeat for Jack. This keeps us empty-handed and guessing. One twist occurs when, just when we least expect it, a bus explodes behind Jack.The acting here is, on the whole, pretty good. Keanu Reeves has not always acted well, but he is pretty good as the intense, hardened cop Jack Traven. Sandra Bullock is not bad as Annie the panicky passenger, either. Dennis Hopper, however, is a revelation, playing the bad guy with a deranged maliciousness which makes us, as the audience, love to hate him. He always seems to act as the bad guy in movies and you can see why here.The special effects and explosions, like in most good action movies, are awesome. The initial bus explosion is shocking, but the best one would be the airliner one, which ends up as a fireball into the sky.All in all, this is a great action movie which never goes below 50 miles an hour for a second. Not only that, it keeps us guessing as to what is going to happen at the end, making it a credible thriller as well. If you are into action films like me and haven't seen this, see it now. You'll be in 'for a wild, crazy ride'.5/5 stars",Speed

All the actors delivered a stunning performance of people who were accidentally drawn into this fuss. Keanu Reeves as usual played a decent and good character with obviously 9 lives who saves every single one. Sandra Bullock seemed to overplay a bit, but, generally, that was a great job. Impeccable action movie!",Speed
244,merem1,review,10,21 February 2017,I grew up watching this fantastic action movie. The acting from the cast is strong and awesome. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are good in their roles as the good characters. The villain played by Dennis Hopper is excellent as the sick and twisted bomber. The film is very suspenseful. The intense setting on a bus rigged to blow if it drops below 50 MPH is brilliant. It keeps the action moving at a relentless pace and never slows down. I still really enjoy the film to this day. It is way better than many of the films that get made today. The director of Speed did a good job. I could talk about this film forever.,Speed

This movie remains one of the best action movies ever made and continues to be a template of what makes for a great movie-viewing experience. Though the plot is incredibly unlikely to ever occur in real life, it's not so absurd to the point where it's completely unbelievable. In between all the very intense action scenes, there's also a great bit of character development. This movie does a great job of somehow making the audience care for these characters in the midst of all the insanity going on.

This film is a nail-bitter action-thriller from the moment it starts, right up until the end. Just about everything in this story works. The script is fantastic. The cast is perfect. Even Keanu, who many often rag on for his wooden performances, nails the heroic rookie cop. The set pieces are all very exciting. The VFX still look great because these are all practical effects. The score is also fantastic.Sure, there are moments where you have to suspend disbelief. During those times, you have to laugh and say, ""oh, there is no way that would really happen."" But in a popcorn roller-coaster movie like this, it doesn't matter.

This is one of the Few Films he has done that I actually enjoy more then a good laugh from Bill & Ted or the film that made Keanu Reeves, The Matrix. He is really good in this. Sandra Bullock is also awesome. Dennis Hopper always plays the same bad guy voice. Watch him in David Lynch's Blue Velvet and he plays a bad guy that is more evil then the Ex-Angry Cop in Speed. This film gets one thumb down but is worth a watch. In the early 90's when this film came out it did very well at the Box Office and for rentals. Cool film of the time but the sequel sucks.

One morning Jack witnesses a bus explode and Jack receives a phone call from Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper), a retired Atlanta bomb squad explosives expert gone bad, Payne has wired a passenger bus to explode, where if the bus speeds at 50 miles per hour the bomb is armed, if the bus slows down and drops below 50 miles per hour the bus will explode. Payne demands $3-million dollars and Jack or any of the passengers tries to get off the bus, he will detonate the bomb. Managing to get on the bus, Jack with help of one of the passengers, Annie (Sandra Bullock) who is driving the bus when the driver is injured, tries to keep the passengers alive and guide the bus through the traffic, and keep the bus speeding at 50 miles per hour, as the S.W.A.T team and Jack's partner, explosives expert Harry Temple set to discover Payne's location and find a way to disarm the bomb before the bomb explodes when the bus runs out of gas.The actors in the film were played very well, especially Reeves and Hoppers roles.There was a sequel to this called ""Speed II: Cruise Control"". I have not seen it, nor I will buy it, because, it got poor reviews, Reeves chose not to star in it, no resemblance to the first film.Overall, a very well made film.Speed gets 10 stars.",Speed
251,sterlinrivera-2000,An Action Classic,10,21 March 2019,"Speed is a well made fantastic movie that has a great scale of action and crime.Keanu Reeves plays a cop, Jack, that angers a former bomb squad member, Howard (played by Dennis Hopper), by foiling his plans at taking hostages. Howard decides plant a bomb on a bus. When the bus hits 50 MPH, it is armed. It does so, and now Jack has to keep this bus going above 50 MPH, or else it blows up. He also meets Annie (played by Sandra Bullock) and she does the driving, while Jack does the defending.Keanu Reeves was awesome, and Sandra Bullock did a great job. Her character was almost like a sidekick, and Reeves had pretty solid chemistry with her. Dennis Hopper did a pretty smooth job at playing the villain, and the other cast members did a good job as well. The plot is nicely done, not confusing, and well understood.

252,jpc-34200,Pop Quiz Hotshot!,9,28 March 2020,"I have not revisited Speed since the late 90's probably when I graduated high school at 18. Back then ultra action movies were in. Con-Air, Executive Decision, Die Hard 3, Daylight, to name a few but Speed was one for the film books. It is a cat and mouse chase about a Los Angeles cop named Jack Traven and a former LAPD cop turned una-bomber named Howard Payne. Then, there's Sandra Bullock in her first big screen role in an action film previous to playing a cop of the future in Demolition Man playing Annie. Howard Payne puts a bomb inside a watch on the bottom of a public bus going northbound into Metro L.A. He scares all the local people going on a bus to work. Jack Traven jumps the bus to inform the passengers that the he's going to disabled the bomb.Speed is ultimate action movie of the 1990s. Just like Bullitt was in the 60's and the French Connection was in the 70's. It's a high speed octane action thriller filled with smart action sequences, high speed thrills, suspenseful novelty movie cliches. The supporting actors Joe Morton, Jeff Daniels are good. The music by Mark Macina and the direction by Jan De Bont is thrilling, white knuckle roller coaster ride.If Jurassic Park was the movie of the summer of 1993, than Speed was the special effects picture of 1994.

254,xanderlm,Awesome movie!!,10,16 October 2021,"Upfront, ""Speed"" is NOT a complex, intricate, thought provoking, sophisticated whodunit thriller. It IS, however, a 1hr 55min fun, in your face, action filled, taut, suspenseful thriller with a wry comic edge which will have you glued to your seat with a large bucket of popcorn. There is not a dull moment in this film - the fun is in the viewing so I'll not reveal much in the way of details. I'll say the opening action of the movie involves a crowded skyscraper elevator in a precarious situation in which Keanu Reeves & Jeff Daniels as specialized police officers & partners must save the day. This exciting opening immediately grabs your undivided interest & there is no let up from there. The bulk of the movie involves a city bus with an eclectic group of passengers, including a lovely Sandra Bullock. Unfortunately, a bomb has been placed on the bus & will detonate if its speed goes below 50mph. Oh, my!! Enter our two aforementioned heroes. The film ends with a most exciting & satisfying finish involving a run away subway car with poor Reeves & Bullock in a most precarious predicament. The comic madman behind all this mayhem is deliciously played by Dennis Hopper, a revengeful nut case who really loves his devilish deeds. The entire cast is excellent particularly Daniels, Bullock & Hopper. Keanu Reeves is perfectly cast here, giving one of his best, if not the best, performance of his long career. Jan de Bont in his directorial debut hits a bullseye-his direction is flawless. The background score is appropriately terrific & the 2 Oscars it won for Best Sound & Sound Editing were justly deserved. ""Speed"" is great, pure, no brain required, entertainment & a movie you can view many times & still be totally engaged each time. So, get yourself a bucket of buttered popcorn, a large Coke, some milk duds or whatever, sit back & totally enjoy.

""Speed"" has been called ""Die Hard on a Bus"" since the movie centers on a cop named Jack (Keanu Reeves) who is out to stop an insane bomber (Dennis Hopper) who put one of his little friends on a city bus and when the bus hits 50 MPH it will be activated and if it drops to 50 or below, it'll blow up, while taking all the passengers with it.And this is why the movie has seemingly never-ending surprises, twists and suspense. It's a great idea that is executed so well. For most of the movie the hot driver Anne (Sandra Bullock) and Jack have to find a way to get around traffic and an incomplete freeway to keep the bus going and another thing, keep in mind that they can't keep going around over 50 MPH forever, because think about the bombers demands getting his money in just 3 hours. And also, if they try to get the passengers off he will set the bomb off and use a little common sense, gas doesn't last forever. So how the hell are they gonna get out of this mess? Watch it and find out.Is this a Die Hard rip-off? Yes. Is it the best rip-off of Die Hard? Absolutely. ""Under Siege"" (Die Hard on a ship) was a bit dull and since it was Steven Seagal, I don't think I need to say more. ""Passenger 57"" (Die Hard on a plane) was poorly executed and didn't have a shred of intelligence; in other words; it was dumb.This one ""Die Hard on a Bus"" is freakishly awesome, Reeves is at his best without being so wooden as usual (""There's enough C-4 on this thing to put a hole in the world""). Dennis Hopper makes a classic, creepy bad guy named Howard Payne who blows Hans Gruber out of the park (""Poor people are crazy, Jack. I'm eccentric""). And Sandra Bullock creates some really good chemistry with Keanu in this, and her acting is flawless because she gets into a very humane character than can be seen by her reaction when she accidentally hits a baby carriage. And she's also clearly vulnerable since she occasionally breaks down when something bad happens. And I say Sandra Bullock's acting is the one of the best parts of the movie and her magnus opus of her whole career. Also Jeff Daniels wasn't too shabby as Harry since, like Bullock, provides some human sense into this movie (""That's our scumbaaaaag!"")The supporting cast on the bus has a few people who are worth pointing out such as the cussing Ortiz (""Man sure has a hard-on for this bus"") and Stephens, the annoying tourist who tries to act cool to impress people but he's really timid and totally loses it when he realizes the situation on the bus.The stunts are also really cool, you get to see Jack go under the bus to try to disarm the bomb at high speed and when he uses the crane to hold the elevator in the beginning. And the film won a couple Oscars for Sound and special effects, I think. And it deserved them, 'cause the movie looks AND sounds like if a real life bomb threat happened. SPOILERS!: And the part when the bus collided with the plane at the end was perfectly done with the bad@$$ explosion.This is over 2 hours long, (thank god!) unlike most action films that are about 90 minutes or less and don't have a a lot of suspense or development because of it. And the suspense in ""Speed"" will NEVER stop until you see the credits roll. This is well worth your money and your time, make sure you watch this before you die, because I'm glad I did.",Speed

It has various layers of humor, and most of it it's actually self-mockery, somehow... yes, the action-pace is fast, the explosions are great, most part of the dialogue is rather witty, but you kind of expect Keanu to turn around and wink at you, like ""it's only a movie"".

After an unsuccessful attack on a building, a terrorist plants a bomb on a bus that will detonate if the bus drops below 50mph.It is simplistic but effective. The minor details of the movie are what make it succeed. stunt work on and off the bus is photographed with daring explicity. Jan De Bont is determined to show us everything. He doesn't cower.The movie is also acted well. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock have instant chemistry which inspires sympathy from the audience, which in turn heightens suspense, thrills, etc.These details come together to make a terrific action adventure. It's a shame that De Bont went on to make commercialist bilge like tomb raider 2 and the haunting. I must admit that i am one of the few people who will defend speed 2 cruise control.

The intense moving thrill is undermined by two factors. First is the quite unnatural reaction and emotion from the passenger. Second is the quite inept aura exuded from the police force. This element has to exist as a plot convenience because the plot fails to make the antagonist's plan intricate enough.

262,bjoernidler,Archetypical action-movie,9,14 June 2019,"If there is some kind of formula for the perfect action movie, Speed is chemistry of the highest level.It gives us a short but frantic opening scene, not unlike your typical James-Bond movie. We also get to know the hero and the villain.Then we are quickly put into an impossible situation (a bus that will explode if it runs slower than 50). Now Speed milks this situation and puts new obstacles in our hero's (and the bus') way.
I know that this is classic Die Hard-Stuff. But rarely does a Die Hard-clone work so perfectly well. Everything here from a camera-, editing- and pacing point of view works extremely well.As usual, you have to accept that we are in movieland and not in real life. But hey, at least Speed is more realistic than all 'Fast and Furious'-Parts which have done everything possible and impossible with cars except flying in space.The acting is appropriate for this kind of movies. Keanu Reeves is such a good guy. Dennis Hopper is such a bad guy.One thing bothers me though: I really can't stand Sandra Bullock in this phase of her career. In Speed, she is playing the role of the natural every-day girl. Okay. But Bullock portrays her as an extremely annoying, squeaking woman who repeats almost everything she says multiple times. Drink a shot every time Bullock repeats the same thing in the same or slightly different fashion.

I watched this again online in 2020, and it's still such a great thrill ride to watch. Of course the acting isn't that great, but it's the authentic feel this film give is what makes it so great and a classic!
Keanu Reeves was just great as the action hero here...but he didn't come off as the hero that fixes and knows everything. He was human, and played the role of an LAPD cop so well. He carried the character's cop job throughout the film, in an intense situation. As an audience, you begin to connect with ""Jack Traven"", and the fact that Keanu Reeves played him was a great choice.
Sandra Bullock was great, and positive energy to have throughout the film. Her character's energy really came through, and you can see the acting chemistry between her and Reeves.

Okay, mistake number 1 (though not for box office). Then there are the cops, with guns out, going into the bomber's house. Now, I kinda had the feeling then and there that the weapon of choice for a bomber is a bomb, but the cops went in and mistake number 2: Boom! A few Darwin awards there. Then Annie Porter, for no good reason, goes to the last scene, revealing herself, and now the bomber knows that they somehow made it off the bus. Mistake number 3, mayhem ensues.

What is most important when seeing an action film? Some think it's the rhythm, others think it's the script, others say it's all about the leading actor.I personally believe that a good, solid, action film ought to give you an adrenaline rush, so to speak, and Speed gives you just that. The plot is very intelligent and the action has an amazing rhythm.Plus, I observed a strategic substrate which I really appreciated - although is quite common when hostage takeover - , because it thickened the atmosphere.It wasn't all about catching the bad guy and saving the innocents, the situation wasn't simple to deal with, there were moments when you actually think the bad guy is gonna escape, because lets face it the bad guy was brilliant, sick but brilliant.The surprise element is always welcome in action titles, and we had plenty of surprises with Speed.As for acting, Keanu Revees is among best actors when it comes to sweat, bullets and danger.He does a really good job in this film.Sandra Bullock was good too, she genuinely succeeded in transmitting the spontaneity of her character, a woman who literally speaks her mind.Dennis Hopper illustrated with greatness the madness of Howard Payne, so we can't say the acting was poor.Besides the great script, because it was a great one, the sound was absolutely awesome. The main theme gives you goosebumps, it worked smoothly with the film style.All in all, I loved this title, and I find it one of the very best action films ever to be seen on screen.I rate it 8/10.",Speed

Keanu Reevs was great and took it on really well... i wish i could say the same about Sandra Bullock who i cannot see her as an actress at all, i just cant see what people like in her ! she cannot act nor beautiful or appealing what the hell is she famous for ?however as usual the sequel sucked big time and damaged the image of the first one, and was a total bust at the ticket office",Speed

279,Dr.Jolly,A perfect example on how special effects have become more important than plot.,3,13 July 1999,"When I first saw Speed in the theaters, I thought it was average at best. Then I saw it about every other day on cable and I've found that this it is even worse than I originally thought. The only good thing to come out of this movie is that it put Keanu Reeves on a top list of Hollywood actors and enabled him to do great movies like Devil's Advocate and The Matrix. This movie is totally based on the materialistic wants of today's young audience and completely ignored realistic plots or even a plot at all along with down-playing the abilities of Jeff Daniels and Dennis Hopper. I did a report in school on the 51 things in Speed that couldn't possibly happen in real life and in fact, the whole plot by Hopper is impossible at the beginning. When Reeves receives that phone call, he could've easily phoned the bus services in L.A. and had them call the victimized bus before it reached 50 miles an hour. Even without all that, the fact that Reeves made halfway across L.A. in 10 or so minutes is bulls**t, just ask anyone who lives there. Reeves does ok, but shows nothing of what he's capable with in the future, which makes it even more surprising when he does those future movies. This movie is what made Sandra Bullock and why I don't know. She's not gorgeous and she has little acting ability. Any cute girl with a little wit could've played the part. Dennis Hopper has the best role in the movie and does as good as he can with the lousy script he has. Hopper remains one of the least used talents in Hollywood. Why is Jeff Daniels in this movie? Daniels was in this movie for no reason accept to get his name in there. What a sad waste of talent. None of the bus passengers show anything accept average abilities and when the bitchy lady dies halfway through, I feel bad because I'm happy about it. This movie has a few neat scenes and is ok to sit through the first time. Hopper and Reeves are enough to watch for a while, anyway. I give this movie a 3 out of 10. It is probably the most overrated movie in the 1990's.",Speed
280,loccomotive2000,The Timeless Adrenaline Filled Action Classic,9,16 May 2010,"The nineties was a great time for action blockbusters, where instead of relying heavily on CGI, the action sequences in those movies were actually filmed as they were, and rather than spending so much time for in depth story and character development, they choose to engage us in a more direct, emotional manner. ""Speed"" is quite easily the greatest example.In the film, LAPD Bomb Squad cop Jack Traven must race against time to rescue passengers onboard a bus with a bomb that'll go off if it goes below 50mph. Keanu Reeves reinvents the action hero by, instead of being the big tough guy with a ton of one-liners, he is earnest, emotional and perhaps most importantly, vulnerable. At his side is the wonderful Sandra Bullock as Jack's lovable sidekick/love interest Annie, whose bubbly and sarcastic personality beautifully compliments with Jack's gungho, intense character. And on the other side is Dennis Hopper as the disgruntled bad guy who is as crazy as he is intelligent, setting up the foil for the centerpiece with taunts and impossible tests for our hero.The real draw here, however, remains the now iconic high octane action sequences. In a simple yet brilliant fashion, three major crisises make up the three acts. And be it the elevator, the bus or the subway, once the action starts, prepare to hold on to dear life until it ends. Because not only does it never stop, it barely slows down. And it's not just the vehicles that go for a ride; out heroes too endure a roller coaster ride of emotions. Hopelessness, anxiety, fear and exhilaration; we uncontrollably become inclined to feel not just for them, but with them.And I reserve this paragraph for praising the very underrated score by Mark Mancina. The memorable main theme sets you in the mood for pulsating action, while the heroic theme not only works brilliantly on the romance between Jack and Annie, it does wonders to amplify the heroic and noble nature of saving lives.Even today, at 16 years later, and having seen the movie multiple times, Speed still gives me the emotions I had when seeing it for the first time, putting me at the edge of my seat.

286,thelastjedi_good,Speed is light and totally lovable,9,13 July 2017,"Speed is the definition of a film that knows what it is. It finds its tone and it excels.The film tells the story of Jack Traven, an LA SWAT officer. After the film immediately catches the audience's attention with a high-pressure hostage situation in a downtown LA elevator (an exploit that provides smart indirect characterization of our leads), the film deals mostly with a city bus on the highway. A bomb expert has rigged the bus, and if its speed drops below 50 MPH, the explosive will detonate, The narrative takes twists and turns, and as our protagonists decipher clues left behind by the villain, the viewer is always highly engaged. The always-evolving plot is very smartly designed. While the series of difficulties our characters face is numerous, it is never confusing. Plot arcs appear and resolve themselves in such a way that the audience is never lost, in fact the clues are simple enough for the audience to play detective along with the characters.The characters in Speed are all very simple but very strong. We learn about who the characters are by seeing them react in high-pressure situations. This is ideal in making people who seem real and it is executed effectively. By the time the movie ends, it's hard not to feel pride and relief for the characters after seeing the hell that they go through and their courage. This is an action movie, but it constructs its characters with more nuance than most acclaimed dramas.Speed isn't afraid to be what it is, and that is perhaps its biggest triumph. All of the film's action is totally over-the-top. The bus infamously makes a totally unrealistic jump across a giant stretch of uncompleted highway, and the viewer is left laughing at its sheer stupidity. But, the film wears the insanity on its sleeve and isn't embarrassed by the craziness. If you wanted a serious police drama, Speed wasn't the right choice.If you want to crack open a beer and just enjoy a smart, funny, and just plain fun action movie, Speed is the right choice.",Speed
287,hatsunemiku-27340,A Ride Worth Taking,7,11 September 2017,"A simple rule for action movies, especially of the Western variety: the more explosions the better. Everyone likes a good explosion and nothing draws the audience's attention from wandering more than a loud, colorful boom. This is most likely why action films have cars or buildings blow up for no obvious reason. A car crunches into another, boom. A car flips, boom. A car is shot, boom. It's a trope that has caused me to scratch my head many a time. But to take the majority of action cinema seriously is to miss the point. Heavily criticizing the cinematography or technical aspects of Commando would be a pointlessly stupid endeavor that would beg the question of why you wasted your time. The production knew they weren't making an Oscar worthy film, they were making entertainment.Speed is entertainment, pure and simple. It's a film in three acts, all of which involve a means of transportation, with no fluff buffering the main sequences. We go quickly from being trapped on an elevator to the iconic bus scenes to the finale on a subway train. Who Keanu Reeves's character, Jack, is doesn't matter. We don't need to see him at home preparing for work or enjoying dinner with his fellow police officers. We are immediately introduced to the threat, an elevator full of people being held for ransom by a remote bomber, and the heroes, Jack and Harry, sent to save them. Everything we need to know about these two is told through action and organic dialogue. It's not enough to really flesh the characters out, but that's not the point. The point of the sequence is the end goal and the process of achieving said goal. How will Jack and Harry get these folks off the elevator and diffuse the bomb? The introduction of the villain, Howard, is another simplistic approach. He kills a guy and we know he's evil. Through the course of the movie we never exactly understand his full motives for what he's doing (money sure, but some movies would opt to elaborate) nor is he a particularly memorable baddie. He's the catalyst for what makes Speed memorable: the action sequences.The elevator is a well executed scene but the true meat is in the bus sequence, introducing Sandra Bullock's character of Annie. Again, no real introduction, just organic storytelling. She boards a bus that has a bomb on it. Once the bus hits fifty miles an hour, it has to keep going over fifty or it'll explode. Jack learns of this plot directly from Howard and thus begins one of action cinema's most iconic rescues.There's not a lot to say about it from a technical perspective. Speed is a well-directed affair and there's nothing awkward or bad to complain about. New obstacles are constantly thrown at the bus, almost to a comedic level. A woman with a baby stroller crosses the street in front of the bus, children cross, and eventually the overpass the bus gets on is incomplete, forcing a James Bond worthy flight over a fifty foot gap. None of this will wow you nor is it truly anything unique, but the rapidity of the obstacles combined with the tight direction and confident performances from Reeves and Bullock lead to an entertaining hour of high speed thrills.The finale is pretty predictable at first (heck, the whole movie is formulaic to be honest). Bad guy disguises as good guys, takes an unsuspecting Annie hostage, and forces Jack into a final confrontation on a subway. Like the elevator, this is a good sequence but not memorable. We want to see the villain get his come-uppance and we want Jack and Annie to get together. And both happen with enough of the prerequisite destruction of property that you'll be glued.So the question becomes: as formulaic as Speed is, as basic as the characters are, what makes it so good? The answer: everything stated above. It's a pure adrenaline rush film that's well-made and executed despite the shallowness. It's not a piece of art by any means and doesn't try to be. There are constant explosions, moments of excitement, and edge of your seat situations.It's a film that begs of you to sit back, shut off your brain, and enjoy the ride.And that ride is well worth taking.",Speed

In the last second, Jack and Harry manage to get the captives to safety. In a typical movie, a moment's relaxation would follow. But in Jan De Bont's action spectacle speed, what would normally be enough material for a whole evening's entertainment is merely the curtain-raiser to a racing roller coaster ride in three acts which grips the audience from beginning to end.Speed is so famous because it is a fast-pacing movie and does not take a long time to get started action from beginning to end It was Sandra's moment to shine and she did, this was her claim to fame and still is one of her most disguised films of her's along side 'Hope Floats' and 'Miss Congeneality' 'Speed' is a great film for all ages see if Annie (Bullock) manages to stay above the limit of 50mph because if she doesn't the bus will explode see the explosions the 50ft leap over the bridge.'EXPLOSIVE'",Speed

290,filmfreak-ochoa23,One of the Definitive Action Movies!!,9,11 September 2011,"Speed 1994 Movie ReviewThe introductory score of Mark Mancini opens up the film to entice the viewer into a roller-coaster ride that will not let go from the very beginning. The villain here is not your typical terrorist who is out for revenge but simply a cop who does not accept retirement life and simply wants his due, in this case pure simple money. The hero is the cop who will stop at nothing to save innocent civilians because it is the right thing, regardless of what his superiors tell him to do or not do. This film is the template for such classics as the Metal Gear Solid franchise with Mancini's score clearly being an inspiration for Harry Gregson Williams's MGS Saga Theme. 24 also took the rogue agent that plays against the rules to justify the means from Speed in the similarities of Jack Traver to Jack Bauer. Sandra Bullock playing Annie is also very fun to watch as a quirky but lovable character, also very beautiful and it reminds me why I like Sandra Bullock. The explosions, especially the one on the bus that is built up in the first quarter of the film, once it pays off it is one of the most spectacular explosions in film that I have seen in quite a while and it is comparable to the hospital explosion in The Dark Knight!

291,FreddieLee04,Summer action has rarely been better!,9,21 July 2021,"Only 1991's 'Point Break' can rival 'Speed' for the Greatest Summer Action movie title. Both are not just enthralling, well-directed and smart flicks, but they are also two Keanu Reeves films. Reeves has shown time and time again that his acting chops are limited, but take one look at his film CV, and you'd be easily convinced he was one of the all-time bests: The Matrix, John Wick and My Own Private Idaho all stand out as highlights among the occasional dud (47 Ronin or The Day The Earth Stood Still).Reeves is Jack Travern, a man so obviously inspired by Willis' John McClane from the Die Hard films (of which there had been two installments by the time Speed was being filmed), but quite simply, Travern still feels fresh and engaging despite the many similarities between both action leads. Sandra Bullock is the helpless damsell-in-distress stuck on a bus rigged with explosives by madman Dennis Hopper. This unhinged terrorist plays games with Travern throughout the movie as his efforts to save the cast of characters on-board become increasingly more difficult and strained.What works about 'Speed', and thus making it stand out from the crowd some twenty-seven years later, is all in the thrilling plot which is brought to life so brilliantly by director Jan De Bont and composer Mark Mancina. To this day, I hear the theme for 'Speed' and I'm ready to dig my nails into the palms of my hands and lean forward onto the edge of my seat. Few movies- actioners or not- have been able to generate such excitement from score and direction alone.But let's not forget the pace at which the film sticks at. Whereas a lot of action films simply dry up towards the end of the second act, just when the hero realises something they need to do or some place they need to get to, 'Speed' simply elevates things. We go from a bus to a train. The unconventional structure is something that works much to the film's strength.Jan De Bont, take a bow.",Speed
292,Stenian,"Elongated film that didn't need the elaborate elevator and train sequences, in addition to a weak and cartoonish villain",5,26 February 2021,"The film is decent and it was a guilty pleasure of mine back in the early 2000s when I used to watch it as a kid. Growing up, I realized how flawed it was, mainly due to its protracted length and its unlikable vapid villain.Let's start with the runtime. Look, long movies are amazing, if they are justified by their context. This is a fun, action-thriller. But you may say, many action films are around 2 hours long. Yes, but this one had unnecessarily extended scenes that pretty much were their own 'story arcs':The elevator rescue scene at the beginning, which was 20 minutes long, could've been its own film. 20 minutes of suspense, tension, excitement and it was all just the opening sequence or a set up for the bus setting? It really took a toll on this film's pace. Not to mention, the bar scene after that with Harry being drunk. At least they should have deleted that?The film could've easily ended after the bus crashes into a cargo jet, after Jack and Ann embrace. Payne, at that time, should've been subdued by McMahon or his team (preferable the former). The heroes don't have to meet the villains vis-à-vis. But nah, let's extend this. Let's make another small story arc where, this time, it's on a train and it cannot stop. And, conveniently, the bad guy has the girl and the good guy must save her. This was totally contrived for me.Oh, and nothing against Dennis Hopper's performance, whom is a good actor. But I couldn't stand his cartoonish, over the top, cliched, cookie-cutter villain. He belonged in a Disney film or something. He was bad even for 90s cheesy villain standards. Payne may have been enjoyable in, say, a satirical action film and his performance would've been satisfactory. But in a serious action thriller he seemed very inappropriate, with his campy ""villain laughs"".The music was not so good as well and was at times cringeworthy (that annoying ""dan-dan DAN DAN"" techno synth theme when Jack was in action really irked me), besides that dramatic love (?) theme heard at the end of the film in the train sequence, which was fresh and delightful. Overall, the music sounded like it was composed by a poor man's Hans Zimmer. I would've chosen Alan Silvestri or something.In conclusion, the film is definitely worth watching. It had captivating and riveting scenes of suspense and tension, which all took place in the bus. I enjoyed the humanity between the characters in the bus. Ortiz (Carlos Carrasco) and Stephens (Alan Ruck) were very likable and warm characters, that give this film a human touch. The ""opening"" scene, or rather story arc, with the elevator was pointless that, to the least, should've been 10 minutes shorter. And the train sequence at the end didn't even have to be in the film.",Speed

294,themonkwithnoname,What watching a movie after 20 years feel like,10,6 October 2017,"Masterfully crafted!That's all I can say. I watched Speed in my early teens after it came out in 1994. It has been 23 years and I had vague recollection of the specific scenes in the story. However as I watched the film after decades long gap, I realized why this became a classic household, water fountain action film.Keanu Reeves was born to play this role. He exuded an ungodly calmness that is so rare a trait that every man wishes he possessed. The chemistry between him and Sandra Bullock's character Andy was just the right dosage in an unlikely coupling. If Keanue was the epitome of a man's assured calmness, then Sandra was just the opposite. Possibly she is the only one who can make a damsel-in- distress, overapologetic, tad bit clumsy and slightly nagging character so sexy.Before you read further I must warn this review contains many spoilers.The fact that I love about Speed is that it is a movie within movie. Even if the movie finished after the elevator saga, it would still be considered a decent flick. There are layers within layers and supersubplots within subplots.At one stage, Keanu after saving the world and hostage from an exploding elevator, he kept sweeping the area to locate the bomber.There was quote once I read - which is mostly probably apocryphal - regarding Einstein where he said: ""The difference between other people and I is that when asked to find a needle in a haystack, I keep going.""The intro was a three minute long of dizzying credit. But I still gave it 10 out of 10 and the scene reminded me of Einstein's quote.Keanu should really author a book on ""How to be cool, calm and in control under pressure 101"".. in fact, even the way he just stepped off the 'runaway train' exuded so much suaveness that it was as if he performed walking on water and it was 'no big deal'.There are so many details that stands out that made up the subplots and subcontext within the main theme. For instance, every character had his or her own space, niche and personality, starting with Keanu's partner, the 'Jamaican(?)' looking driver to the bus driver who even after getting shot signaled the entry with the latch to the 'communicator' who after giving robotic communication translated 'oh f**' to 'oh darn' to the criminal who reacted only to be assaulted by another hero... every character told a story and every frame was interesting. In is unfortunate, that producers do not spare so much detail into movies like they used to in the past.There was also the right dosage of comic relief. For instance, after repeated attempts when Keanu was drove up to the bus driver Sandra had a 'you got be kidding' look in her face as she said: ""He is out of his mind"" made me laugh like I haven't in a long time. Of course, it was only trumped by ""...I received a ticekt for speeding..."" scene later on that was dead on witty.Not to mention, the way the couple of stunt drivers veered the cars putting the cop cars to 90 degree blocking the way in the airport complete halt smacked of entire badassery.Can movies procure religious experience? I often wondered; not to be nutjobby. It is said Rothko's paintings could make people tear up. As I laid on my bed thinking about the calmness with which Keanu handled the entire programme, I couldn't help but think that so often people cut was in traffic, spill their coffee, mistakenly slam the door catching out finger, or accidentally poke with form and so often we lose it triggered at the slightest press of our buttons. So often! However, when calm and collected mental composure is held, no obstacle seems impossible.Movies like this opens the portal to the doorway on what really is possible for a self-actualized man to achieve once he was conquered himself.",Speed
295,primona,Speed...still an adrenaline rush after all these years,8,10 February 2013,"I just saw this gem of a movie again after seeing it several years ago. A few things struck me seeing this film again: First, this movie still delivers suspense after all these years. The aptly titled ""Speed"" is as much about keeping you on an adrenaline rush as it is about passengers on a bomb rigged bus that will explode if the bus goes below 50 mph. The film begins with psychopath Dennis Hopper (Howard Payne) rigging an elevator full of passengers in an attempt to extort millions of dollars from the city. His plans go awry after meeting Jack Traven (Keeanu Reeves). This incident sparks a spectacular revenge plot that involves each man trying to outwit the other.Second, there are very few movies that create the chemistry between characters that this movie does. I'm not just talking about the obvious sizzle between Annie (Sandra Bullock) and Jack which manages to be created without any nudity or steamy sex scenes – go figure. You also have strong chemistry with the friendship between Jack and his detective partner Harry (played by Jeff Daniels) and even the respect and concern shown between Jack and his boss, the under-rated Joe Morton as Capt Mcmahon.Third, the writing and acting is formidable. This movie has equal parts action/drama and witty humor. You'll want to reference many witty lines after watching this film from Annie's confession that her license has been revoked for speeding to the back and forth dialogue between the exasperated bus passengers (Gargantuan, I'm thinking of you!). I think most of us agree that Keeanu is never going to be on a list for greatest actors but he is credible as the bad ass cop with good looks and great biceps! Sandra plays a spunky Annie quite well. Dennis is perfectly cast as the bitter maniac bomb genius and all the other characters including those with minimal lines seem to make a lasting impression.This film is definitely worth watching or re-watching!",Speed

297,jeremyglick,Thoroughly entertaining,8,1 March 2005,"Speed is one of my favorite action movies of all time, just a notch below contemporaries like Terminator 2 and Die Hard. The premise is so simple that it's almost a parody of movie pitches (Homer Simpson's line was ""I saw this movie about a bus that had to SPEED around a city, keeping its SPEED over fifty, and if its SPEED dropped, it would explode! I think it was called 'The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down'.""). Fortunately this film came to be much better than the sum of its parts, and it's deservedly remembered as one of the most entertaining films of the 90s.What distinguishes Speed is its humanity, due in no small part to the character of Annie (Sandra Bullock). The best example of this is the moment when Annie, while driving the bus, thinks she has struck a baby stroller. She becomes so distraught that she lets go of the steering wheel, never mind the fact that she is in charge of driving a bomb-laden bus through the L.A. suburbs. It's one of several moments that draw us into the film by helping us identify with the characters, and it's all the more elegant for its simplicity. This movie isn't complex, but it doesn't claim to be.There is a certain irony that Speed succeeds so well on a human level, since Jan de Bont is not generally considered an ""actor's director"". He started as a cinematographer, and even when he talks about directing he discusses technical aspects and seldom mentions working with actors. Nowhere was this more evident than Speed 2, which pretty much killed his directorial career. Given that, it's all the more remarkable what he pulled off in the original Speed, as everything seemed to come together for him.The overall performances really serve this picture well. Keanu is at his best (which is to say, mediocre), Sandra launched a career based on this movie, and Dennis Hopper did a wonderful job as the sardonic villain. Plus he has one of my favorite bad-guy lines of all time (Traven: ""You're crazy."" Payne: ""Poor people are crazy, Jack. I'm eccentric."").8/10",Speed

As an ex-bus driver I was watching the momentum of the bus in certain situations and suspected that it had to drop below fifty, but hey, it's Hollywood, innit??!!

Only to later find that he's planted a bomb on the bus and is holding it for ransom. The tricky thing about the bomb is that it can only be activated if this bus slows down under 50 miles an hour. This creates a some what interesting situation.With a big cast Sandra Bullock, Dennis Hopper, and Keanu Reeves it's the perfect summer movie. Dennis Hopper gives a above average portrayal of the terrorist while Keanu Reeves falls flat on his face trying to act.Sandra Bullock gives a fine performance, there didn't seem yo be a lot of personality to her character though.The story is very unique and original which is nice to see in this time of sequels and remakes.

What more do you need in an action film.  I know what you're thinking, it needs more scenes with the bus.  They should have had a decoy bus to lead the bomber off while the real bus could escape.  They should have had at least 50 buses that all had bombs on them that Keanu had to try to disarm.  They also should have had a super fast tow bus that could tow the other bus at 50 MPH forever.  This movie needed much more content with the bus.  But one good part is the shot of the subway breaking out onto the street is actually a BUS!  Maybe it would have been better if the elevator scene was not actually an elevator, rather a bus suspended by a cable in an elevator shaft.

309,MaesterFilm,One of the best action films of all time,8,27 January 2017,"Action is not one of my favorite genres of film but I really enjoyed this movie.The action was amazing, it was actual action, thrilling high-stakes action, not a fight scene. I'm not a fan of two robots fighting and destroying an entire city, or fist fights between people on top of a train or any of that stuff that's been overdone to death. Those scenes have one inevitable result and you're just waiting for it to happen.In this film the driver has to keep the bus going, but there are numerous challenges as the roads are not empty. It subverts the hostage situation in films, where the captor is actually there, often surrounded by police, and negotiates with a negotiator for his safe passage and ransom.Here the hostages are on a bus, the negotiator is on the bus, but the captor isn't. We don't know where he is, so the police cannot send a SWAT team to fix this. They actually have to use their brains for this puzzle. Even the location of this thing is not stationary, so the cops can't cordon off the block, they have to clear the roads as much as they could.Hostage films are usually about police that follow protocol, usually with a rogue negotiator who thinks outside the box to do it his own way and save the day. This film is about a situation for which there is no protocol and they have to think on their feet.That's why it's interesting and worth the watch.I give it 8/10. There are some flaws, such as the bad guy being a cheesy, stereotypical villain, among others, but it still is a great film.",Speed

It's pure fun and excitement, through and through. The minor plot holes are easily forgiven and forgotten among the fascinating premise, frantic pace, and superb acting.Keanu Reeves' character is the brave, fiercely dedicated, instantly lovable, and absolutely adorable (if reckless to a fault) LAPD officer Jack Traven. Keanu does a great job, portraying all the intensity of a hot shot who works hard, loves to win, hates to lose, and refuses to let innocents die.Keanu is joined by Jeff Daniels, Sandra Bullock and Dennis Hopper, all of whom are admirable in their roles of mentor/best friend, innocent caught up in the action, and crazy (but not stupid) terrorist with an affinity for huge explosions.The plot: After LAPD officer Jack Traven foils a terrorist attempt to hold hostages for ransom in an elevator, the terrorist forms a personal grudge against Jack...and sets up an impossible scenario, knowing Jack will try to save the day, but planning that he will fail and die along with the rest of the hostages.

He laughs and jumps of excitement when a person burns to death. It is demented and disturbing. But I'm lead to believe that a good movie can be due to a good antagonist. Annoying and sociopath.There are shouting and dialogues though that are, to my understanding, stupid and childish. It seems it is its way to express excitement and action on the moment. Well, it doesn't work on today's age. We just don't go for that anymore. It is unreal and obvious. When asked the difference between the action movies in the 90s and 21st century, then that would be it.And hey. Did I said it is stupid. How? and Why? Couldn't he just do this and do that? Should have done this to avoid that. But even with this notice, I find the movie good enough for an hour and a half of my time.To sum it up, it is annoying yet enjoyable at 7/10.The hero is Reeves. He is a bomb expert. A hotshot as the terrorist defines. Full attention to his work. Has a blond friend and some shouting officer as a team. Together, they work and battle against the forces of a maniac, a sociopath, and a kid, trapped in a old man's body. During the fight'n the hero would meet somebody. Somebody to meet! the stunts, bombs blowing off as metal expands and go to waste is believable enough. The action and thrill is no doubt top notch. the jumping and catching, heart stopping.

316,PrivateBryant,Amazing action film.,9,29 June 2003,"I will start off by saying that I watch movies both for entertainment and from a critical,thoughtful point of view. This is definitely an entertaining movie, but it stands up critically aswell. I watch virtually any genre of film, but action is one of my favourites. And this is my favourite action movie. Despite my high regard for Die Hard, I think this is better. It succeeds in so many ways. Firstly, the plot: Well, its pretty damn simple, but in this case thats a good thing. A guy has rigged a bus so that if it goes above 50 MPH a bomb is armed and if it drops below that speed again, it blows. I have heard much criticism of this being unrealistic, but I don't see why. Think about the amount of destruction modern technology can cause today, and it seems plausible. Another guy, a cop, is trying to stop the worst from happening by boarding the bus. The Actors/ Characters: Keanu Reeves is excellent and likeable as LAPD officer Jack Traven, the type that fears nothing and will do anything ,no matter how dangerous. Dennis Hopper is the ex - cop that has rigged the bus. This is an incredible performance. In my opinion,in terms of action films, the best bad guy ever and one of the finest pieces of completely addictive acting in any type of film ever. Sandra Bullock is Annie, a normal woman that ends up driving a bus haphazardly through busy city steets at 55 MPH - and she was originally worried about being late for work!! I don't know if she is like this in real life, but if she is, she must get annoying. I don't like this character very much because she screams stupid things and repeats herself all the way through the film. Joe Morton and Jeff Daniels are solid as Jack's superior Mac and his partner Harry. As for the action sequences- they are thrilling, like many people have said, because they are real. They don't rely on special effects at all. And that means they are much more exciting. You are kept on the edge of your seat throughout and that feeling doesn't falter - I have seen this movie LOADS of times and it still excites me in a big way. It really does grip you. This is partly thanks to the fantastic score by Mark Mancina. This makes sure that even if the action starts to bore you, which is unlikely, you are still captivated. The scores' only flaw is that a certain bit of music gets a bit repetitive after a while. In conclusion, this film is a cracking, thrilling, exhilirating rollercoaster ride of an action movie, that has yet to be equalled. As a piece of entertainment, its brilliant. From a critical perspective, it has only a few minor flaws - i.e Sandra Bullocks infuriating screaming and a few quotes that are very tin - eared and unnatural, which is a shame because what makes this film so great is that the action IS natural, as oppose to obviously CGI. The film fanatic in me loves this film, The critic applauds it. 9 and a 1/2 out of 10.",Speed

If it drops below 50, it blows up. What do you do? What do you do!?"" The action movie of the 80's is without a doubt 'Die Hard'. The movie that defines action in the first decade of the millennium change is in my opinion 'The Matrix' (I know it's made in '99 but you do understand I have to get 'Speed' here in my introduction and besides I first saw 'The Matrix' in 2000...). So what comes to mind when thinking of action films that defines and changes the genre for better in the 90's? 'Speed'. F**k it, I just came to think about 'T2 - Judgment Day'...So anyhow, 'Speed' didn't define action for the 90's. 'The Matrix' and 'T2' did a better job. But if 'Speed' would've been done wrong, the end result would've been terrible ('Speed 2, anyone?). Done well, action films can be a lot of fun (and thus forgiving some serious goofs and illogical happenings).Jan de Bont directed 'Speed' as his first feature film. He had worked on several action films prior to 'Speed' as a cinematographer (Die Hard', 'Hunt for the Red October'...). What I've read from various film magazines and interweb sites, 'Speed' had some issues when going to production. First of all, I have to mention Joss Whedon's ('Firefly' and 'Serenity') name as he contributed on the script making it work better. He was left uncredited, though. But what worried me the most was that Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock weren't among the first choices for starring roles. Stephen Baldwin, William Baldwin, Arnold Schwarzenegger... ""Get to da choppa!"" just sounds better than ""Stop da buzz!"".Glenn Close, Meryl Streep, Anjelica Huston, Emma Thompson, Diane Lane? Great actresses without a doubt but was their first intention to make the film about a group of middle aged tourists on a 20 mph bus touring Beverly Hills? OK, that sounded very stupid and I apologize for my lame effort to be ""funny"".Films like 'Speed' are intended to charm the younger audience. I can't think of a better on-screen couple than Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. Both good looking and terrible actors (yeah, like she deserved the Oscar!). The acting is so terrible at times that you have to be set for the right mood for it to work. You can't see 'Speed' and wait for some groundbreaking method acting. This is supposed to be cheesy and fun. It's not like Jeff Daniels or Dennis Hopper would be doing a better job but I just can't think of any other for their roles. Hopper is perfect for his role as the villain (just like in 'Super Mario Bros'... yeah right.) and in my opinion he is the scene stealer.So what's the film really about then? Small pensions and cheap gold watches make retired cops go berserk and make bombs on elevators and buses while forgetting everything about police tactics and getting their faces turn purple of paint. That is pretty much the whole idea. So what do you do? What do you do!? Just go see it for the fun and the hidden charm.",Speed

325,Erica2001,One of the best action movies,10,13 June 2001,"I saw Speed a long time ago, I think in 1995. When I saw it for the first time in a long time yesterday, I didn't remember much. I didn't remember the bus jump or the part where the bus nearly tipped over when it was making a sharp turn or the part where several people were about to die in an elevator in the beginning of the movie. Even still, I enjoyed Speed even more than when I saw it the first time. It has so much action in it. I was never bored. This movie was thrilling, action packed, and suspenseful. It was fun to look back and see how Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves were back then. As I was seeing this movie for the first time in so long, I noticed something about Sandra Bullock. She seemed a bit annoying in this film. Don't get me wrong, Sandra is definately my favorite actress, but looking back on this film, I thought she could have made her character seem more real. She has improved so much as an actress since then though and evidence of that is her performances in A Time To Kill, Hope Floats, 28 Days, Miss Congeniality, and much more. Keanu Reeves usually doesn't impress me much with his acting, but I thought he gave a pretty good performance in this film. The cast of this movie was pretty good and it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. It is simply flawless, definately Keanu's best film next to The Gift and The Matrix. I give Speed a 10 out of 10.",Speed

Well, after careful ""thinking""(if I could think straight at 7) I decided to go and see it. BOY OH BOY!!!!! Despite the strong language, action violence and anything else that isn't healthy for a young mind, I loved it. I ignored the language, all I cared was if the bus was gonna blow or not.The first film I saw with Keanu Reeves in it was Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure/Bogus Journey, but SPEED made me fall in love Keanu Reeves!!!! Still to date, Keanu Reeves is my favorite actor; and I have my mom and the movie SPEED to thank for that.Listen to this! When I was extremely sick with the flu for a week, the movie Speed had just recently come out on video. While lying in bed sick and nothing to watch on television, my mom pleasantly surprised me with the movie SPEED to watch since she knew I was absolutely in love with Keanu Reeves and just loved the movie. That really helped me out alot. Tripped out isn't it?! Well hey, whatever helps. This movie has boosted my love for action movies of all kinds. Like I said, despite the strong language, this movie really would make a good family film for teenagers and parents.(It was on FOX/ABC Family a while back ago believe it or not) I love this film.

It looks very aesthetically pleasing but is absolutely woeful in content and completely predictable. Not that I wish to criticise the talents of Dennis Hopper, who is a good actor and his casting was pretty good, but as a movie it is woodenly acted and not my bag. I think that Keanu Reeves more successful outings in Chain Reaction and The Devil's Advocate in a way that enables the viewer to engage with the plot, without seeing what may be coming next. Speed fails to do this, at least with any conviction in any context and although it looks cool, once you get about an hour or so into it, you suddenly realize that it is anything but. I was disappointed as for finally seeing this film just over a year ago after wanting to see it since it came out and sat there wanting to like it while I was watching it, but come the end I decided that it wasn't for me.",Speed

The hero characters are played by Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves, in one of his few good roles. Keanu pulls of the action hero very well in this film, and Sandra Bullock appears as a likable heroine who has more to do than scream as people are killed around her. Dennis Hopper also stars as the deranged bomber, delivering a classic line; ""No Jack. Poor people are crazy, I'm eccentric!"" He seems larger than life, probably due to his low screen time.

With the added bonus of time, Speed has become more than just a great action film, it has become a nostalgic one, firmly planting its feet in time and memory. It was one of the first films I watched that had me on the edge of my seat and had a clear hero and villain contrast. Howard Payne (the late Dennis Hopper), the maniacal bomb expert trying to secure his retirement and Jack Travin (Keanu Reeves) the relentlessly will powered maverick cop who won't stop until he gets his man.Speed is one of my all time favourite action films. Scene after scene I feel the movie builds with edge of your seat, muscle tensing action, as well as a side of ""I don't care how crazy this plot is, I love it!"".

Down to the precarious ""Oh, @$£!"" style cliffhangers to the suspenseful climax, Speed keeps you on the edge of your seat all the way through.  The very nature (and at the time, quite original too) of the plot means that there is never a dull moment.  That bus is always moving at 50MPH and you're constantly left guessing as to what is going to happen next.Reeves, as usual, plays his role with something of a lack of distinction, but unlike some of his roles (e.g. Dracula) he plays it with the gung-ho style that suits him.  Hopper in the role of Payne makes a superb baddie, both with his edgy laugh and playful but sinister moods, both portrayed beautifully.Overall, Speed is a film which will keep you going again and again, and, like Reeves' other hit, the Matrix, will keep you coming back again and again for the stunts alone.",Speed

339,colagreen3,Super Speed!,8,13 March 2009,"Speed is a suspenseful thriller that features Officer Jack Traven, an L.A.P.D specialist (Keanu Reeves) and Detective Harry Temple (Jeff Daniels) who both battle against a rather bitter villain ex cop, Howard Payne (Dennis Hopper) Payne (Hopper) produces a revenge attack by planting a bomb on a bus that has the potential to kill thousands of innocent people. It's up to Officer Jack Traven (Reeves) to prevent the bus from exploding. He does this amazingly by boarding the bus and keeping the speed above 50mph. He also has to deal with terrified passengers which he finds isn't an easy job at all. Annie Porter (Sandra Bullock) is a passenger on board of the bus and she takes control as the driver. She controls the bus with an obvious wisdom of horror but also with a strong sentiment of authority. Reeves character puts his trust into Annie immediately and they are both able to support each other in many life or death situations that occur. Jack Traven (Reeves) and Annie (Bullock) form a comforting bond which really helps them both whilst they are in the middle of a crisis. Payne(Hopper) is simply greedy for money and wants Traven (Reeves) to provide the money for him - before he starts taking away people's lives, and he will do so with no hesitation. There is not a second of wasted screen time which just makes it a spectacular film to watch. The film is very enjoyable and includes intense situations that are simply breathtaking. ""Speed"" has been correlated to ""Die Hard"" because it features vulnerable hostages that are surviving from a heroic figure. What I enjoyed about this film is that it had a mixture of suspense and humour featuring fast moving shots and a killer sense of hilarity with various unexpected plot twists!However, there were parts of the film appeared to be a little unrealistic and it seemed that more research ought to have taken into position before shooting, or shouldn't have been included in the final edit at all.. I found myself questioning the logic during certain scenes considering it is classified as a realist film. The acting isn't exactly perfection at times either; with a lot of lines being delivered gave me a cringe worth reaction.Payne (Hopper) portrays a very realist villain and I was impressed with his performance. His malevolency antics are quite simply worrying as he appears to be invincible, even though he's just sitting at his residence relaxing with his feet up. Harry Temple (Daniels) attempts to go after Payne (Hopper). Its a challenge to find out Payne's identity but he manages to do so, which is risky business and and finds out how dangerous Payne (Hopper) really is.Jan de Bont directed ""Speed"" as his debut whilst previously switching from cinematography on other films, including ""Die Hard"". I was very impressed with his efforts taking into consideration that it was the first time in full charge. The film was written by Graham Yost, who could also be considered as a fresher, as ""Speed"" was the first film he wrote, prior to writing TV shows. To finish up, I did enjoy this film and I imagine many others will too. Don't have any doubt about watching this. Its not a must see film, but its enjoyable to say the least. So, if you ever have 111 minutes to spare in your life then the best thing to do is resort to ""Speed"". The film, not the drug.",Speed

343,palmk,The most overrated action flick ever.,2,2 March 2008,"This movie blows, and for one very particular reason: the Incredible Leaping Bus scene. At one point in the film, the characters in the bus -- unable to slow down or they'll be blown up -- are faced with the choice of taking a road under construction, which might involve driving on dirt or other unpaved grades, or taking a bridge that is missing a section and thereby involves certain death. They choose the bridge. We are then treated to several seconds of tension as they approach the dropoff where they will obviously all be killed. Just as they approach the gap in the bridge -- where there is no launch ramp, the bus will clearly plunge downward as soon as the pavement ends -- the bus inexplicably leaps into the air, not even waiting to reach the edge of the pavement. It then sails perhaps thirty yards as if the laws of gravity have been suspended and lands pretty as you please on the other end of the bridge.As a viewer, you tell yourself ""Oh, so magic is involved!"" The movie is ruined. There is no more suspense because clearly, whatever trouble they get into, they can just snap their fingers to get out of it.The critics told us Speed was great, and then the audience was treated to this garbage. So when Speed II came out, it scarcely mattered what the critics thought of it, nobody was going to bother to see it. And then the critics couldn't figure out why Speed II tanked.",Speed

A bus is carrying a bomb that will detonate if the bus reduces its speed to less than 50mph after it triggers the device by first reaching 50mph. A cop, Reeves, and a passenger, played by Sandra Bullock, in a breakout role, must thwart the criminal's scheme by trying to save the lives on board the bus, and somehow catch the villain in the process. The action never lets up, as we are quickly thrust into a terrorist threat right at the beginning of the movie, which is a preamble of things to come. Dennis Hopper plays a very intelligent and conniving bad guy. This is a true action movie. All cylinders are in full gear on this one. Great action, great villain, great characters, great plot. I only wish De Bont, the director, would make something as good as this movie again. Sadly, he has faltered ever since. Not all of his movies after this 1994 masterpiece are terrible or bad, but he is just missing something, maybe plausibility. All in all, even if you aren't a big Keanu Reeves fan, this is a breathtaking, adrenaline racing, awesome action movie. It really packs a punch and it is plausible. You may think that sounds silly to say, but everything that happens could actually happen. And I'm not a big Reeves fan myself, though I certainly respected his choice to make this movie.

Speed also helped launch Sandra Bullock's career.  Dennis Hopper's portrayal of Howard Payne is fantastic and Speed is a worth addition to his already impressive CV of films.  He makes a great villain.The main three stars of Reeves, Bullock, & Hopper is strongly supported by Joe Morton (Terminator 2) and Jeff Daniels (Dumb and Dumber) and it's also nice to see supporting actors actually doing something.I am proud to say that Speed has a place on my DVD rack.

I can't believe they did not get hurt at all at the end of the movie.Howard called a few times with a phone. Why didn't they track that number the first/second time he called?This movie is full of errors and mistakes. Many of them could have been avoided.",Speed

It made me have a faster heart beat than usual. I also think the performance of the actors were perfect. They showed the emotions very well. I also have to admit though, that Dennis Hopper's performance was bit off when it came to his evil schemes. Here's some of the obstacles they had to get through: made a successful jump through a 50 feet ramp, went through the city, nearly hit pedestrians, trying to get Sam (the bus driver) off after being shot in the back, a fuel leakage, racing through the airport, trying to disable the bomb underneath the bus and unloading passengers off the bus while in motion.

367,SiuWing,Great action moive,10,24 December 1999,"It's a great action movie I've ever seen. Although I'd watched it quite long time from now, the screenplay, action and the tricks are still freshly in my memory. I like it not just because the arresting actors did a extremely good job, but also the tense story. Many may complaint that the stories of action films are usually too simple or even idiotic. Actually, this one is no exception. However, I, in my opinion, like its beauty of simplicity very much. It just gives the viewers more room for experiencing the exciting mood without being busy in understanding all the complicated things or details which may , in certain extent, help the story to be appeared more logical and smooth.I hadn't expected that this film was so tense that there was no one climax, which is usually supposed to be shown at the end of the film,  but it put you in all time excitement right from the  start. The trapping in the elevator,  the sequences of challenges faced in the bus (such as the murderer in the bus, the wound of the bus driver, the appearance of the baby cart in the road, the cliff that they've to across, the danger in running out petrol in bus..etc), and finally the fighting in the train are all qualified as a high tidal wave in the film in my point of view.Besides all these, the music is really surprisingly outstanding. It's simple but it fit the picture and mood so much. It helped me to concentrate on seeing this film and also it's now  helping me to remember every detail of the moive.",Speed

372,darthtuhmader,A highly entertaining and tense action film!,9,30 December 2009,"Take a bus, put a bomb on it, set it to explode if the bus drives at less than 50 mph, and then put every obstacle imaginable in front of it, except maybe a family of ducks, and you've got Speed, one of the best action films ever.You know, it is interesting that sequels are usually criticized for being all action, no story. Ironically, however, one of my many complaints on Speed 2 was that it was too boring in the beginning. The characters were on the boat for half an hour before the action even started. Speed, however, starts off right away with an action scene involving a smart but crazy bomb expert known as Howard Payne trapping a group of people in an elevator, and threatening to send them falling down to their doom unless he's paid 3 million. However, two LAPD officers, Jack Traven and Harry Temple are able to save the people just in time before going after Howard Payne, which causes Harry to get shot in the leg and Howard Payne to set off a bomb that presumably kills him.This action scene would make a great climax in a lot of films, yet for Speed it is only the opening scene. After that this film enters what has to be a record for it 10 minutes of no action, where Jack and Harry are awarded medals of honor, and stay up late partying. The next day, however, Jack witnesses a bus driven by one of his friends exploding, and then receives a phone call from Howard Payne who is revealed to have survived the bomb explosion the day before, telling him that the bus exploding was just a demonstration, and he has another bomb rigged to a bus full of passengers that will go on if the bus reaches 50 mph, and will then explode after that if the bus drives under 50 mph, or if one of the passengers tries to get off the bus, and demands a ransom of 3.7 mil to be delivered to him at 11 a.m. After getting the number of the bus, and phoning Harry, Jack heads off to find it, yet arrives too late, as the bus has already reached 50 mph. Despite this, Jack manages to jump on, yet upon seeing an LAPD cop enter the bus, one of the passengers freaks out, and during all the commotion shots the bus driver, forcing another passenger, Annie Porter, to drive the bus instead. Now it is up to Annie with the help of Jack to keep the bus moving at more than 50 mph, while Jack tries to dismantle the bomb and Harry tries to find out where Payne is.Like I said, the film puts every kind of obstacle in front of the bus. You're barely given a moment to catch your breath after the bus passes through one obstacle before another one appears. It is the kind of film that will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through it.And yet despite all of these action scenes, the film doesn't ignore it's characters. Its skill comes in developing its characters while they react to all the action scenes around them. You feel their relief after they get past a very difficult obstacle, and their depression when their situation seems most hopeless. Like Jack, you barely know the passengers when he first enters the bus, yet as time passes they start to become more and more familiar to you, and their personalities began to show.The actors play an important part in the film. You've got to hand it to Keanu Reeves, from the goof ball Ted to the super cool Neo, he certainly plays a wide range of roles. This time he plays a James Bond type of character with Jack Traven, daring, sarcastic, yet he also makes him more uncertain, and more of a guy who follows his guts than his wits, which helps make the film feel even more tense, especially when you have an awesome villain like Payne, played by Dennis Hopper, who seems to have thought of everything and has it all under control, to the point where you wonder how can Jack outwit him. And Sandra Bullock positively shines as the tough but vulnerable Annie Porter.1994 was a great year for action films, and Speed was arguably the best of them all. Granted, it doesn't feel out of place if you would put it in a James Bond movie, yet it is done so well that you wish a lot of the James Bond movies could be as good as it, or if its sequel could be as good for that matter.",Speed

Dennis Hopper is fun to watch as usual, but again, I just can't get past the physical impossibilities presented as fact.

But officer Jack and his friend Harry spoils his plan.So to get revenge and get money he puts a bomb on a bus. If the bus goes under 50 mph it explodes if anyone gets off the bus it explodes. So officer Jack gets on the bus to try and prevent it from exploding as they race through L.A at fast speed keeping it from crashing into the busy L.A traffic.The characters are about as deep as an splinter. Meanwhile a good movie would have side characters as deep as an knife and main characters as deep as a sword, this movies characters are about as shallow as it gets. The acting is terrible at times and just makes me laugh when i'm supposed to feel empathy for the characters. It's cheesy too but what can you expect from a 90's action movie. Even with all these flaws it's very enjoyable and i would really recommend watching it at least once.Also i noticed that the picture does not have that much contrast and looks very dull. In fact it's so dull that i turned the contrast up in VLC media player to compensate for it. This is something i have never had to do before with any other movie.The movie never really slows down it's just action scene after action scene, it actually gets ridiculous after a while and if it ever does slow down then 20 seconds later the bus will be jumping over a ramp or maybe crashing into a unsuspecting car. There's not really any story to it, it's just plot.I feel as if Michael Bay just took all his inspiration from Speed and just cranked it up.Enough with the negatives i'll tell you what the best part of the movie is.

The scene when all passengers are passed to the other bus are almost impossible to do, the speed of both vehicles must be exact during a quite long period. The final scene with the subway crash, please, nobody would survive or may think about sex! The guy trying to take a picture with a close Polaroyd camera is well the final joke.

388,tkddude_06,Very good Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock Are Great,10,24 February 2005,"Speed"" was a runaway success in 1994. It was a block-buster in every sense of the word and critically speaking, it is an excellent motion picture. The film deals with an LAPD swat officer (Keanu Reeves) who is playing a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with crazed ex-cop Dennis Hopper. After Reeves stops Hopper from blowing up a high-rise building, the next obstacle is a city bus. Hopper has rigged the bus to explode if the ""speed"" ever drops below 50 miles per hour. Sandra Bullock, in her star-making role, plays an unlucky passenger who becomes the center of attention when she is forced to be the driver when the original navigator is accidentally shot. The great thing about ""Speed"" is the fact that it never tries to be more than it is. It goes for non-stop action, thrills, chills, and spills. However, Dennis Hopper's character is somewhat complex and his performance probably should have garnered him an Oscar nomination.Tkddude_06",Speed

A flat, nasal, monotone voice interspersed with banal moments of horrendous acting is the only bad thing. And I couldn't get past the first ten minutes of Speed 2 due to her excruciatingly presence. A lot of films from this period have a lot of big name stars in them either as a way of selling the film or because the 'big name star' sees his or her career on the wane.

395,KniDukDev,A Very Good Film,8,11 November 1999,"Speed is a very good action film.  Crashes, explosions, suspense...It's all there.What isn't there is a lot of acting.  The relationship between Jack (Keanu Reeves) and Annie (Sandra Bullock) is relatively weak.  Many of their conversations are absolutely stale, as they sound like robots.  Dennis Hopper, however, is amazing.  There is no doubt that he does the best job in the movie.Also, like most action movies, there are some hard to believe parts in the movie.  First of all, how can you expect some woman to ride a bus cold turkey?  Not very likely.  If Hopper is such a smart villian, wouldn't he have thought of the police figuring out how to tape over the recorder in the bus?  In the movie he practically wanted Jack to find out that there was a camera on the bus by calling Annie a ""wildcat,""referring to the logo on her jacket of the University of Arizona.  Plus, wouldn't he have thought about the paint in the money bag since he used to be a cop?  There are other incidents which can be seen as doubtful like the bus flying 50 feet. However, that's what makes an action movie great...the impossible happening.The poor acting at times doesn't take away from the story at all.

It completely went over my head as a kid as I took it as a straight-faced serious film. Boy was I in for a treat! This is the funniest parody film I've seen since Scary Movie!The film has every cliche going. There's a cartoon-ish OTT villain with spurious and ill-defined motives. The main characters are a veritable who's who of every one-dimensional archetype there is. Add to that a dollop of cheesy and cliched dialogue (pretty much every single action dialogue trope gets used) as well as actions and fundamental physics that make no logical sense (outside of an action movie).The film pulls all of this off with aplomb, with the actors playing every scene completely straight, and it really works! It's a real contrast to some of the hammy ""wink-wink"" overacting in a lot modern day spoofs. Dennis Hopper does add a little bit of ham but it really works to sell this as a spoof, with classic one-liners and an evil laugh to boot!What we have here is a film way ahead of its time, deftly lampooning all the action movie cliches that had formed in the 80's and early 90's. The fact that it takes itself so seriously is only to its credit. It's very rare for me but this is truly one of those films that makes you laugh out loud, mainly due to how straight all the cheesy lines are delivered. Truly hilarious!So if you're looking for a decent satire of action movies (but can't stand the hammy acting or threadbare plots of other spoofs) you can't go wrong with Speed!",Speed

This was, and still is in my opinion, Keanu Reeves best film to date. The chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock is very believable.Please, watch this movie if you haven't before. You won't be disappointed.",Speed
401,chriscohen-50092,On the edge of your seat every time,8,26 January 2021,"This movie never gets old. Even if it's outdated, the suspense holds up. Anything is possible in this action-packed thriller.",Speed
402,Toxic_Hobo5,Predictable,6,2 June 2021,"Don't get me wrong the movie is filled with action and the plot line is interesting, but it is very basic and predictable. There aren't any really interesting/big plot twists and feels at times as though they are trying to make the movie longer adding unnecessary parts.",Speed
403,trevorsimms1,This movie rocks!,9,23 December 2006,"man this was a fun movie to watch. suspense at every corner while they were on that bus - and even after the bus stops it keeps going! rent this one if you haven't seen it if you like action films or Sandra Bullock too.Dennis Hopper palys a decent enough bad guy - basically he's supposed to act a bit insain so you have to accept that reality, but heck you might as well because he's putting a bomb on a bus with a speedometer trigger and the bus end up clearing a huge gap in the freeway while airborne so there is a lot you have to just accept to enjoy the film anyway. Overall an excellent action flick.",Speed
404,lovin_meforme10,loved it,10,23 December 2006,"just watched this movie and had to comment,loved every minute i think Keanu Reeves looks like Freedi Prince Jr a little, anyways had to comment loved this movie xxx it had me on the edge of my seat till the every end it is amazing how they could manage to get out of these extreme situations just loved it and Constantine it brilliant too. watch all of that film too loved that i guess i just love Keanu Reeves he does his job to the best of his ability and it shows. Speed one of the best in my list i watch this film a few years back and never saw how good it actually was. running out of things to right and i had to write at least 10 lines and in getting annoyed with this site you should be able to write as much or as little as you want",Speed
405,joperbe-33457,Absurd,3,29 September 2021,"This movie is based on the premise that a bus cannot drop below 50 miles an hour or a Bomb will go off. There's no way any bus can go on and on traveling over 50 mph through any city without wrecking. The more I watched the more the more unbelievable it became that this bus just doesn't wreck,it's so preposterous I had a smh so many times whole movie. I found a whole movie laughable...your mileage may vary.",Speed
406,caelumpanache,They need to go back to high school.,4,20 December 2001,"The movie failed to entertain.  The acting failed to convey the sense of urgency and fear that one would expect.  The movie threw away the laws of physics a couple of times.  Sometimes movies will change natural laws, those movies are called science fiction or fantasy, as speed was neither, it should have stayed with realism.",Speed
407,LiarGames,Fantastic!,10,11 March 2011,"They speed up an elevator.. They speed up a bus.. and finally.. They SPEED UP A bloody Train! I don't know how to express myself here. This movie is one-of-a-kind in Action Thrillers. No movie has ever come close to the thrill I experienced by watching the fantastic movie! I watched this as a young boy and even after 10 years I still love itKeanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock act brilliantly for their part. Dennis Hooper gives me the chills. Even the annoying man on the bus was perfect.This movie absorbed me right into it within a few minutes and I really don't know how this movie isn't in the Top 20 :)If you haven't watched this movie by now(which I highly doubt) WATCH IT!!! Otherwise, I will.. for the hundredth time.",Speed
408,da_pierce,Best Action Film of the 90s,10,28 June 2004,"I'm a big fan of thrilling action and special effects movies and Speed had it all throughout. It never slowed down. I never got tired of the action, from the opening elevator scene to the final scene of the subway crash. This film will keep you guessing and on the edge of your seat. Dennis Hopper was really convincing as the mad bomber. Even though he was the bad guy his character was a likable bad guy. Speed has one of the all time best special effects ever seen in a movie, the subway crash near the end of the film. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock characters ride the runaway subway train to the end of the line where it crashes through a construction area and onto Hollywood Blvd near the Chinese theatre. They survive the crash to make Speed 2.",Speed

410,JackTraven,Best movie i´ve ever seen,10,31 August 2003,"The best movie i have ever seen. The soundtrack is the best action soundtrack i have ever heard. Keanu Reeves is so a great actor at this movie. Speed was the first movie, which i had buy. Now, 8 years later, i watch Speed every week, because this film is so cool.",Speed
411,ChelleMarie,An Incredible Experience (may contain spoilers),10,3 August 2004,"""Speed"" is the perfect example of what movies are all about. Centered on the job of Jack Traven (Keanu Reeves), an LAPD bomb squad officer, this movie grips one to one's seat from the opening scene. Titled ""Speed"" for good reason, this movie never lets up in its suspense. From a booby-trapped elevator to a bombed bus 2525 to a runaway train, this is one pulse-pounding, nitro-fueled film. The acting is also top-notch, and this film is most definitely one of Keanu Reeves' most superb performances. The film that launched Sandra Bullock into super stardom, ""Speed"" qualifies as one of her most intense performances yet. We also can't forget about Dennis Hopper, who brings to his villainous role a sense of morbid humor.What really pulls the film ""Speed"" together is the exceptional romantic chemistry between the two lead roles, Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock. Their refreshing on-screen relationship is certainly one of the most believable I have ever seen. The musical score by Mark Mancina (Con Air) is one of the most compelling action movie scores, and really makes you feel as if you are on bus 2525. And while ""Speed"" is over a decade old, it still seems so current, and a film that can be watched over and over. So get ready for rush hour, because ""Speed"" is one wild ride!5 out of 5 stars.",Speed
412,barsam2,not that good,5,25 March 2006,"i have to warn you, i'm from Austria and my English is not that good. My opinion of this movie is, that the plot contains errors, that you will find if you watch the movie closely. i don't understand why this movie is so overrated. also the acting of Saudra bullock is not very impressing. only the character which Dennis hopper played maked me laugh sometimes.i saw the movie for the first time tonight and i really was disappointed. ""fighting boredom, trends and silence since '94"" barsam2",Speed
413,kevindias947,Need for 'Speed',10,21 April 2006,"1994 seemed to be a great year for action movies with the release of the ever-so-famous 'Speed'. You'd think winning 2 Oscars and 13 awards in total would give a movie enough respect but not for this one. Combined with great plot twists, an amazing cast and crew, and packed full of action 'Speed' is one movie everyone has got to see. As the movie progresses the action just keeps coming and it's got you screaming at the television. From the elevator hostages to the bomb on bus until the train ride from hell would pretty much sum up the movie in the simplest terms. Still challenges are faced throughout this ride through the fifty feet highway gap, the unexpected deaths, the leaking gas and the train wreck making any viewer have the movie's attention.Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock bring such chemistry on-screen that it would make you want to replay their screens over and over again. Though the actors perform excellent together they do equally well on their own. Dennis Hopper is right on par as the physcopath Howard Payne, who is on a mission of revenge. He delivers his lines perfectly and is convincing as a villain. Overall, this is a movie that you can watch repeatingly and never get bored of it. I still have decades before I ever lose interest in one of my favourite movies 'Speed'.",Speed
414,teambloodsucker,A thriller with great casts,10,27 August 2005,"This movie is like totally excellent. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock act well together and, Keanu is damn good looking! The story line lifts you off your seat, when the film techniques are used perfectly, as the camera moves around allowing the watcher to see what is occurring and what Jack Traven is seeing during this adventure. Humour is also added to give a view on relationships between blokes, and romance between Jack and Annie.It was said that Keanu does his own stunts in this movie, watch and will see why. Speed is the ultimate movie, and is worth watching over and over again. Definitely watch this dude, especially if your a fan of Keanu Reeves and/or Sandra Bullock, or you love classic movies with cops and action, whilst eating popcorn on your couch.",Speed
415,ezcoler,Speed,10,13 November 2005,"Speed is a great, nail-biting, top- notch thriller literally from beginning to end, with a stellar cast.From elevators, convertibles, buses,subways,and more this movie in my opinion is the greatest thriller ever made. Dennis Hopper plays Howard Payne an crippled and crazy terrorist bomb expert.Keanu Reeves (perfectly) plays Jack Travens a young LAPD hot-shot/SWAT ace and Jeff Daniels plays Harry, Jack's responsible partner. In the beginning of the movie, Payne hijacks an elevator by attaching bombs to it. Harry and Jack ruin his plans and save all the people. Moments later they find out that the terrorist is near and in the building.They finally meet with him and before Jack can kill him he commits suicide with bomb strapped to his chest. He appears to be dead (obviously) and the next day he receives a call from Payne saying that he is hijacking a bus with bombs but with a twist. The bus has to stay above 50 mph. The movie takes on from there, with twists and turns,hidden secrets,a love affair and an awesome ending. Speed is a movie you do not want to miss.",Speed

417,awp-25938,You Like Action?,5,15 February 2018,"Speed is a fast paced, action packed movie that focuses all its attention on action and little to a logical story and dialogue sequence. There was little time for me to take a break from the high-tension action scenes because there could be (and was) another explosion or crash around every corner. Jack even made driving interesting as he launched his Crown Victoria into the air right at the beginning of the movie.
Even though this was an original twist on an action film, the next scene was always predictable. Will the passengers survive? Will they make the jump? Will they blow up? These were easy questions to answer. The only unanswered questions I had were ""Why don't they just..."" questions such as ""Why don't they just give him the damn money?""
The dialogue was also a major downside to this film. From the first time every character talked, you could tell how they were going to act for the rest of the movie. Jack was going to be the heroic and smart lead, the bus driver was going to be too kind for his own good, Howard was going to be the evil psychopath, Annie was going to be the strong and assertive woman, and so on. Speed was also full of cheesy one-liners and flirting between the two main protagonists and didn't require much thought. However, that could be why this movie was so successful and can always be found while scrolling through channels. If you are coming home from a hard day's work and want to unwind, this may be the movie for you.
Despite all the criticism, the high budget lead to some very realistic and believable special effects, good sets, and good camera work, even for today's standards. And it didn't have much of the textbook corny acting as seen in other action films around that time. Overall, if you haven't seen this it can be an interesting watch, but don't expect much from this 90's action film.",Speed
