0,bkoganbing,An Awful Waste Of Space,9,19 January 2015,"Although Jodie Foster has won two Oscars in her career I think her best work was done in Contact, a film where the only recognition it received was a nomination for Best Sound. She also never did a more serious film about a more serious topic. Are we in fact the only life there is in this vast universe and how do we find out.As a scientist, something she wanted to be all her life, Foster is determined to get answers in the best way she knows, build the biggest radio telescope there is and throw out a few signals. Someone out in the great beyond will answer. Foster gets an answer.What I love about Contact is that the gamut of human reactions to the possibility of life is dealt with in this film. It ranges from the multi-billionaire who wants his own life extended John Hurt, the geopolitician who is interested in power James Woods, the sincerely religious men of faith who want to see how God fits into the scheme of things Matthew McConaughey, and even the religious terrorist who fears that a mountain of man made dogma that he's based his life on will be washed away Jake Busey. Busey's part is extremely relevant, we have way too many of those in the world and strategically placed they can cause catastrophe.Foster gets a blueprint for a space time travel machine, warp drive the likes of which James T. Kirk only wished he had. It goes horribly wrong the first time, Foster takes it herself for a second try.Mention should also go to David Morse who plays Foster's father, first in scenes with young Jena Malone who was a science prodigy as a kid and later Foster during her 'journey' gets to talk to Morse again. Was it real or a hallucination. His scenes are the highlight of the film for me.Contact takes no sides in the end, it simply takes the position that in terms of the universe humankind is taking baby steps. If we are really the only life in the universe it seems like an awful waste of space.The special effects are fine, the sound was considered Academy worthy. So much more of Contact is, most especially the performances of Jodie Foster and her supporting cast.",Contact
1,Leofwine_draca,Could have been great,4,5 December 2011,"Disappointing 'search for alien life' type film that starts off well – the first hour or so is focused, factual and has some fine actors contributing some decent character work – before it falls apart, becoming mired in now-dated special effects work and an overwhelming veneer of awe/sentimentality that's spoilt many a Hollywood blockbuster (and, indeed, a great number of the films made by director Robert Zemeckis).Jodie Foster is fine to begin with as the dedicated pioneer, desperate to discover the truth about extraterrestrial life; when she's dealing with officious bigwigs, radio equipment and wide open vistas of land, you thoroughly believe in both her and her cause. Later, when she's undergoing a spaced-out journey to the beyond and acting in front of a green screen, she's way out of her comfort zone and her acting suffers accordingly. Along the way, she's supported by a great number of strong performances – to name but a few David Morse, Tom Skerritt, James Woods, John Hurt, William Fichtner and Jake Busey – but by the time the long-winded tale reaches its ultimate conclusion, I was long past caring.",Contact
2,SnoopyStyle,Big ideas,7,22 August 2015,"Dr. Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) starts work for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) program at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. Her mother died in childbirth and her dad died when she was a child. Kent (William Fichtner) is a blind researcher. Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey) is a religious writer who becomes her romantic partner. David Drumlin (Tom Skerritt) is the bottom-line head at the observatory who shuts her down. Four years later, she is still the outcast as funding and facilities dry up. Then she finds an extraterrestrial signal. Drumlin and NSA adviser Michael Kitz (James Woods) take over. Hadden (John Hurt) is an eccentric tycoon who has been supporting her.It's a brainier science fiction. The first half is exciting in the non-action way. It is smart. It tries to add in some action but it is unable to transition. It may be better not to transition. Also Robert Zemeckis overdoes the space travel and the other world. The religious debate takes up too much space and gets a bit clunky. The logic of hiding such a massive construction is highly questionable. The first half rivals any of the best sci-fi and the second half isn't bad either.",Contact
3,Hitchcoc,It Works at Many Levels,8,18 May 1999,"I enjoyed the hopefulness of this movie--the metaphysical angle. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" will always be my favorite science fiction film because it took the stance that there are layers in our evolutionary process--the temporary life that Arthur C. Clarke describes in ""Childhood's End""--that leads to a passing of what we would call ""soul"" for lack of a better word. ""Contact"" renews this. If one looks at the issues of the universe--we are as likely to go inward as outward. Quantum physics teaches us that uncertainties are as likely as certainties. Otherwise, why build the machine? Does it merely offer us movement into the endless void, or does it bring us to new awakenings? I hope that what we are is destined for better things than a frozen sphere, floating in space for tens of billions of years.Like so many movies, this one forces us to take its premise on faith--there are so many issues unresolved--and the whole thing is so cynical. But it forces us to look at issues of self and the future--that makes it worth our time. And it doesn't necessarily have to do with conventional religion.",Contact
4,claudio_carvalho,"Science versus Faith, in One of the Greatest Sci-Fi of the Cinema Industry",10,1 January 2013,"The skeptical scientist Dr. Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) researches extraterrestrial life with her team in Puerto Rico. When David Drumlin (Tom Skerritt) shuts-down the project, Ellie seeks for private funds to reopen her research in New Mexico. An anonymous millionaire provides the necessary funds and Ellie proceeds with her work.Four years later, she is contacted by alien forms from Vega that send a coded message. The millionaire S.R. Hadden (John Hurt) that is financing the research deciphers the message and gives to Ellie the design of an intriguing machine. Ellie concludes that the equipment might be to transport a passenger to Vega. Now she needs to convince a commission formed by military, politicians, scientists and religious leaders that she is the best candidate for the journey. ""Contact"" is one of the greatest sci-fi of the cinema industry. In my opinion, ""Contact"" and ""Gattaca"" are the two last best sci-fi produced by the cinema, and coincidentally they are both from 1997. ""Contact"" presents a great discussion between science and faith, with extraordinary quotes. My favorite is when Ellie asks her father if he believes that there are people in other planets and he answers: ""But I guess I'd say if it is just us... seems like an awful waste of space. I saw ""Contact"" for the last time on 13 May 2000 on DVD and I have just watched it again on Blu-Ray.

5,classicsoncall,"""The universe is a pretty big place.""",8,29 May 2018,"I don't doubt that someday, probably not during my lifetime, but someday, we will eventually make contact with beings from a planet or universe beyond our own. I do subscribe to the belief that out of all the infinite and limitless yada, yada, yada, that there's some kind of intelligence out there. However I don't think it will occur via a captured video transmission of Hitler opening the 1936 Olympics. Just a little of my own input on that.I didn't expect this movie to take the tack that it did with such a strong religion versus science undercurrent. It was prevalent throughout and was the basis on which Dr. Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) was disqualified from taking part in the original 'Machine' mission; she didn't believe in God. A couple decades down the road from when this picture was made, her position probably would have made her a most likely candidate. I don't know if there's a place for faith to work hand in hand with science, but if one believes in a God as a Supreme Being, there's probably some leeway to acknowledge both disciplines.The film had sort of a Twilight Zone type ending when one of the NASA administrators stated that Ellie's video recording on her ride through the wormholes had eighteen hours of static. Though the point is made with the viewer for a bit of an ironic twist, apparently Dr. Arroway wasn't told about it, at least not the way the film implied. That seemed to be a gross deception, but oddly supports the fact that she received even more additional funding to carry on her SETI research, even while most of her scientific testimony seemed to be disregarded. The dichotomy there bothered me.I was curious about the use of Bill Clinton's image in the story, commenting on the Vega discovery. Shortly after the movie's release, the Clinton White House complained about the use of a taped news conference from 1996 where he was talking about a rock that was believed to have come from Mars. Though the footage was obviously used apart from it's original context, the matter went no further and the film was not re-edited to remove the questionable scene. Knowing now what we do about the Clinton's obsessive regard for money, it's possible that the reason the President was so upset was because he wasn't paid to appear in the movie.",Contact
6,gavin6942,Decent Science Fiction,7,14 April 2015,"Dr. Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster), after years of searching, finds conclusive radio proof of intelligent aliens, who send plans for a mysterious machine.Right off the bat, the film opens with Jena Malone, who was not known before ""Donnie Darko"". She has really gone on to bigger and better things (including ""The Hunger Games"") and folks may want to check this out.The cast in general is pretty impressive, and has at least ten faces that we always like to see. Gary Busey? Check. Matthew McConaughey? Check. James Woods? Check.The release of ""Contact"" was publicized by controversies from the Clinton administration and CNN, as well as individual lawsuits from George Miller and Francis Ford Coppola. These are all interesting stories in themselves. The White House was not pleased with how footage was used, and can you blame them?

7,lee_eisenberg,If we really could make contact with another life form...,10,21 October 2005,"Robert Zemeckis' ""Contact"" - from a book by Carl Sagan - explores the possibility of humans making contact with aliens, and how people react. Dr. Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) has always believed that there was life out there somewhere, and one day gets proof of it. The challenge comes in how she will convince her superiors of this, and how various people are going to respond. What ensues is beyond impressive; this isn't just a special effects fest, but a look into how we as humans see things (and see each other). The movie's greatness owes to Zemeckis' top-notch direction, and great support from Matthew McConaughey, Tom Skerritt, Angela Bassett, and James Woods (and even some footage of then-Pres. Clinton). This is one movie that won't disappoint you.",Contact

The film starts off with young Ellie (Donnie Darko's Jena Malone) and her Dad Theodore ""Ted"" Arroway (The Green Mile's David Morse) having their fun astronomy chats, until his death. Years later, Dr. Eleanor ""Ellie"" Arroway (Golden Globe nominated Jodie Foster) is still a free thinking radio astronomer who has got permission to build huge radio satellites, and three years later are built and in use. One day, Ellie receives an unknown radio signal broadcast from deep space. When she and her fellow scientists are able to decipher the Message, they discover detailed instructions for building a mysterious Machine. This machine looks like a transportation device, with circling rings. The first attempt goes wrong because of a guy with a bomb on him, but they find another somewhere in China. When Ellie volunteers herself to go through with it, and the countdown ends, she is transported through a number of wormholes, and sees galaxies and solar systems, till she ends up on a beach meeting her ""alien"" Dad.

9,rmax304823,Where Angels Don't Fear to Tread.,7,19 April 2007,"The film, which isn't a bad one, is so packed with ideas that I'm going to skip the probably familiar plot and just make a few comments. Otherwise we're going to run out of space.What kind of names are we dealing with here? Is it Carl Sagan's idea of goyim naches that WASP parents go about giving their little baby boys and girls names like ""Palmer Joss""? And ""Ellie ARROWAY""? I have it on good authority -- just having made it up -- that in the entire four-million-year history of the human race, nobody has EVER been named Palmer Joss or Ellie Arroway! The film is about a government project that is shut down to cut funds for non-utilitarian research. When it's privately funded, Foster takes over. When they get results, the government bureaucracy arrogantly moves in again, with James Woods muttering darkly about ""militarization"" of the program. Now ""military"" is a dirty word in this context. We've already seen bulky generals sporting lots of stars. We've seen armed men diffuse throughout the SETI station when the news of the signal gets out. Playing the militarization card is a cheap shot at a stereotyped and convenient target. (Yet it's impossible to imagine its not happening.) One-dimensional characters. Foster = lonely, breathlessly idealistic scientist. McCaughnehy = New Age soul looking for theological ""meanings"" behind events. John Hurt = sinister-looking Howard-Hughes billionaire operating underground. (My supporting player in the cult hit, ""From the Hip."") James Woods = obstacle in Foster's life space designed only to object to everything she wants to do, for political reasons. Tom Skerrit = manipulative, ambitious, egocentric bureaucrat whose name (""Drumlin"") means a small hill. President Clinton, Forrest-Gumped into the movie, is bland and speaks in generalities so nebulous that not even Vegans could guess what the hell he's getting at. But this is the way a politician speaks, and he's believable. I even believed Clinton when he said, ""I did not have sexual relations with that woman."" Of course his definition of ""sexual relations"" may be a little ideosyncratic, like mine. Mine involves handcuffs and fettucine.Jodie Foster, as Ellie Arroway, whom most people address as ""Doctor"" but whom a simian politician (Rob Lowe) calls ""Miss."" The selection committee asks her, as one of the candidates for interplanetary travel, ""Do you believe in God?"", and she comes up with some bumbling response about trusting data. Why did she bother to tell the truth? It never stopped our astronauts, who lied blithely about believing in God and going to church regularly. Anyway she could have copped out with some baloney about, yes, she believed in a kind of God like Spinoza's, who expressed himself or herself in physical laws. By the way, the interrogator who says that 95 percent of the world's people believe in a Supreme Being is full of malarkey. Using E. B. Tylor's ""minimal definition of religion,"" a belief in supernatural spirits, we can say that all cultures have a religion, but not all of them have what we would recognize as a Supreme Being. Does Buddhism have a Supreme Being? What's He like? Is Zero a God? The movie raises the question of what would happen if two cultures with very different values came into contact with one another. It's an interesting question. As Arnold Toynbee has observed, it's happened before, when European adventurers first began landing on the soil of the New World. Those settlers devoutly believed in both God and Gold, to the extent that they could distinguish between them. We can at least hope for better results when we go to Vega.Jodie Foster is the central figure of course. Her features are sharp and sleek like a shark's so they are almost a little scary, but her talent is such that she's able to project a full range of emotions, both blatant and subtle, and the viewer is able to make contact with her.One final thought. After watching the expectable computer-generated climactic special effects, the thought came to me unbidden that no power on earth could get me to set foot on that contraption.I miss Carl Sagan a lot. He was a genuinely nice guy who had the grace and good sense not to drop into my comprehensive exams when they were in fact open to any member of the faculty. His enthusiasm for the objects of his study were catching, in the way the flu is catching. Billions and billions of moons and galaxies. I hope he's now at home somewhere among them.",Contact
10,Tweekums,What would we do if contacted by an extra-terrestrial intelligence?,8,20 November 2016,"From a young age Eleanor Arroway was fascinated by science and questioned whether we are alone in the universe; as an adult she is probing the depths of the universe hoping to find a sign that there is intelligent life out there. It isn't popular work and a lot of people would be happy to see her 'frivolous' project ended. She manages to get independent funding from the somewhat eccentric S. R. Hadden but even then it looks as if the project will get cancelled as permission to use a government owned facility is withdrawn. Then she discovers a signal coming from Vega, 24 light years away, it consists of a series of prime numbers and rather disturbingly footage of the opening of the 1936 Olympics in Berlin thankfully it turns out that this was the earliest TV signal of enough power to be received. Mixed in with the signal are a series of documents which when decoded give the schematics to a machine that it is speculated may transport a single person to Vega. By now politics is well into play as well as religion as some believe the project is an affront to their faith. As the project nears its conclusion the question of who should be Earth's representative must be answered and many object to Arroway being selected because of her lack of religious belief.Movies about aliens contacting us usually turn into alien invasions or at the very least as much about the aliens as humanity; this is different as it is almost entirely about what humanities reaction would be. That reaction is believably varied; in such circumstances it is likely that some would be optimistic and others fearful. As the story progresses there is some slightly unnecessary drama but that does at least serve to put Arroway in the 'pilot's seat' for the ultimate ride. Jodie Foster goes a great job as Arroway and the rest of the cast, which includes plenty of familiar faces, is impressive too. The special effects are pretty impressive; this includes both the sci-fi elements and the way archive footage of President Clinton was used to make it look as though he was talking about the issues in the film. Overall I rather enjoyed this and would recommend it to fans of 'hard' sci-fi.",Contact
11,BA_Harrison,Contact vs Interstellar.,9,16 March 2016,"Deep space exploration, theology versus science, extraterrestrial contact, a central father-daughter relationship: there are a lots of similarities between Christopher Nolan's recent hit Interstellar and Robert Zemeckis' Contact; hell they even share the same star in Matthew McConaughey. There is, however, one massive difference between the two films: Contact is a genuinely great film, while Interstellar is merely entertaining in a 'did they really just do that?' kind of way (I often wonder if Nolan was having a laugh at the audience's expense).Obviously, Interstellar boasts state-of-the-art CGI, meaning that it trumps the rather dated looking Contact in terms of jaw-dropping visuals, but with an intelligent script based on the work of Carl Sagan, a terrific central performance from Jodie Foster, and a superb supporting cast that includes James Woods, Jake Busey, Tom Skerritt and John Hurt, Zemeckis' film is the clear winner. Thought provoking and life affirming, Contact leaves the viewer with a genuine sense of awe and wonder; Interstellar, on the other hand, leaves one impressed with the current state of special effects, but pondering more than a few awkward questions regarding the plot (that tidal wave gets me every time, and don't even get me started on the intergalactic bookshelf).8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",Contact
12,moonspinner55,"""Encyclopedia Galactica""",6,25 February 2008,"Renegade scientist (played by a surprisingly willowy and womanly Jodie Foster), who has harbored an obsession with frequencies and contacting parts unknown since she was nine, nearly has her latest scientific funding pulled from her team's work in New Mexico when, after four years, they haven't any proof that life lies outside of our solar system; at that moment, the combative doctor receives first an audio, then a visual signal from a distant planet--and tangles in Washington bureaucracy for the first time. Robert Zemeckis ably directs this film-version of Carl Sagan's book, which features the usual quotient of naysayers, ego-mongers and political bastards (not to mention Matthew McConaughey as a fallen seminarian-turned-theologian and bestselling author!). The film begins so beautifully, with a magical God's eye view of the galaxy, that hope for the picture runs high for the first thirty minutes or so. After that, the narrative becomes quickly entangled in its own red tape, and one has to wade through a lot of scientific data, political bullying, and faux news-clips from CNN before the emotional final chapter. Zemeckis makes an early mistake of mixing movie fiction with real-life players, and his film is uncomfortably stamped with something of a 'cheese factor' after pointless and dated visits from Larry King (who was in on it) and President Bill Clinton (who wasn't). It all leads up to a mind-bending exploration into space for Foster, yet what she finds in the untapped fabric of the universe may strike some as facile and unfulfilling. Certainly the film's slick, savvy production and marvelous visual effects cannot be faulted, and Foster does her usual passionate work. **1/2 from ****",Contact

Jodie Foster stars as a woman who has been looking for life out in space for most of her life with radio signals, until finally, she hears one coming in.  That starts a chain that leads up to the creation of a spaceship sent by the signal and so on, and so forth.  A lesson in faith, si-fi, and how we feel going into 18 hours of darkness (so to speak).

14,wes-connors,"Almost Heaven, Pensacola",7,22 August 2011,"Tragedy during a meteor shower in her childhood helps shape the character of atheist astronomer Jodie Foster (as Eleanor ""Ellie"" Ann Arroway). Ms. Foster works for the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI), which monitors signals from space. Though tirelessly dedicating her hours to listing for meaning in the static of space blips, Foster takes time out for a sexual encounter when she meets handsome wavy-haired Matthew McConaughey (as Palmer Joss). Opposites attract as Mr. McConaughey is a deeply religious man. They want to mate some more, but Foster moves on when her SETI funding source is threatened...Sometime Robert Zemeckis doesn't seem like he was in Carl Sagan's ""Contact"" book...So, Foster leaves McConaughey's telephone number behind, after she packs. We see her place McConaughey's number by the telephone next to the bed where they played ""hide the telescope"". The reason for this scene is unexplained, so we'll just have to assume McConaughey's number is being left for the next occupant. Or, maybe the cleaning person. Apparently, Foster's suitcases are jammed, and/or she's one of those people who don't like putting anything in her pockets. Really, she couldn't possibly have disposed of the paper any other way, because we need to play up this ""romance"" and widen the audience...Also regrettable is the film's muddying of the ""science"" versus ""religion"" waters...Anything more on that subject could affect your viewing pleasure. Getting beyond the criticism (and physics improbabilities), you still get an exciting adventure. Foster offers up another strong characterization; amazingly, she has acquired an alien receptive look. The special effects are outstanding, and enough of Mr. Sagan's spacey thoughtfulness remains. The use of ""real"" people (Bill Clinton, Larry King) is interesting and may someday lose the datedness; until then, Rob Lowe is a hilarious stand in for Ralph Reed.

16,LeonLouisRicci,Carl Sagan's Late Life Capitulation After Misleading so Many,8,22 December 2012,"A pretty good mainstream blockbuster that is sort of a dumbed down, thinking man's, philosophical, science-fiction story of (first) Contact with ex-terrestrials. It is Carl Sagan's penance for misleading so many people. In the end he tried to make amends concerning his weak kneed ""scientific"" explanation that there has been no visitation because there is no physical proof, and they couldn't get here from there.You see, early in his career he ""dared"" to postulate that maybe this UFO thing needs some serious scientific study. But caving to peer pressure he soon learned that if he was going to be taken as a serious scientist, that open minded view was taboo and his career would find itself in a black hole.He was a dedicated debunker and intellectual fraud, and late in life he made a feeble attempt to ponder, at least the possibility, that well, maybe just maybe there might be something to this thing after all. Unlike his colleague J. Allen Hynek who devoted his life to uncovering the truth, Sagan took the safe path of least resistance and became a NASA and Academic hack.The movie is entertaining if not deep, although it pretends to be. But with such a mediocre Director it cannot be anything but a popcorn delivery system. That's OK, but one wishes for a little more intellect and a lot more creativity when such a subject is approached. By the way if anyone doubts that the Government, and religious and scientific leaders for that matter, with its control the populace policies would handle this in any other way, just search for ""The Brooking's Report"" on ET contact and discoveries. It basically stated that if this fact were made public there would be economic and religious collapse and world wide anarchy.

It regards contact and communication with other life forms. Jodi Foster stars as an astronomer who makes contact with another life form and wishes to be the spokesperson for the event. Despite oppositions she gains favour from a man of faith played by Matthew McConaughey. Arguments surface questioning God's existence over science. Foster is transported into space for further contact while her progress is recorded. We learn that her mother died when she was young but she was supported by her father. Robert Zemeckis creates realistic hysteria. He previously made such wonders as Forrest Gump and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? Despite its impressive production, Contact is not one of those films. Foster is a strong presence eager for answers but heading for disappointment. McConaughey is an effective challenger as a Christian philosopher but his presence is mainly to romance Foster until he attempts to conclude with thoughtful spiritual logic. Tom Skerritt, and James Woods labour under standard roles as well as John Hurt making an appearance.

21,Wuchakk,Science and religion in wedded bliss,7,20 February 2013,"If you can imagine ""Armageddon"" without the action you'd have a pretty good idea of ""Contact."" Perhaps this is because they both hail from the late 90s (""Contact"" came out the summer of '97 and ""Armageddon"" a year later). Toss in some elements of ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" and -- voilà -- you have ""Contact."" Not that it doesn't possess its own uniqueness, of course.The story has to do with an astronomer (Jodie Foster) finding conclusive radio evidence of extraterrestrial life. The intelligence -- whatever it is -- then sends data on how to meet, but only one person can go.Foster's character is an atheistic scientist while her romantic interest in the story believes in God (Matthew McConaughey). The respectful tension of these two mindsets in the face of extraterrestrial contact is interesting and the filmmakers do a good job of maintaining a balance between the two, rather than advocating one above the other. Generally speaking, science and religion both pursue truth (the way it really is) but their methods differ, science stresses empirical evidence whereas religion looks to faith and love. Why can't we embrace both? (What a revolutionary idea!)Both vantage points are portrayed by people who are genuine and honest about their pursuit of truth. Between them is the character of David Drumlin (played excellently by Tom Skerritt) who is driven by selfish ambition and therefore willing to put on airs to attain his goals. But corruption comes at a price.The film is based on Carl Sagan's book of the same name. The balance in the film between fact and faith, atheism and belief can be attributed to Sagan's spiritual agnosticism. He rejected the arrogance of atheism and has stated: ""Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light-years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual."" Although I'm not a disciple of Sagan I appreciate his humility, genius and honest reflections on the awesomeness and beauty of the universe and all it's mysteries. The movie conveys this.The film runs two and a half hours.GRADE: B",Contact

27,sddavis63,Bad Story + Bad Acting = Bad Movie,2,14 January 2002,"I don't know whether to begin with the bad acting or the bad story, so let's start with the acting.Jodie Foster: Total unbelievable as the super-scientist Dr. Ellie Arroway, who searches for a signal from outer space, and finally finds one. Sometimes she overacts; sometimes she's hardly noticeable. During the ""launch"" scene, if I had had to hear her yell ""I'm OK to go"" one more time, I'd have let her go and turned to another channel.Tom Skerritt: Showed no enthusiasm at all for the role of David Drumlin, scientist and Arroway's boss. Even when chosen as the ""astronaut,"" Skerritt shows as much enthusiasm as a giant sloth might at sunrise. Just terrible.Matthew McConnaughy: I'm trying not to laugh. I might be able to buy him as a New Age guru type, but as Carter Joss he plays a New Age guru type who gets taken seriously - even by the President of the United States and the entire US Government, who put him on a panel to select the astronaut! Please!And speaking of Bill Clinton, interesting decision to put in newsreel footage of Clinton's press statements that make it sound as if he's addressing this issue. That must have led every viewer to say - ""Hey look Martha! It's a real live President! Guess we should take this seriously!""Now, on to the story. (Might be some minor spoilers here.)The aliens' message is composed of prime numbers (numbers divisible only by one and themselves) to establish that they understand basic mathematics. So, we're told that the message contained, in sequence, the prime numbers up to 101. In fact, they show a printout of the numbers. Sure enough: 1,2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19, etc., etc. Except, listen to the signal. It's fine up to 11, then the next number just goes on and on in the background while the dialogue goes on, well past 13, which is the next prime number. And the Hitler tape. OK. Maybe the opening ceremonies of the 1936 Berlin Olympics would have been the first television signal to go into space. Let's assume it doesn't degrade beyond recognition on the way to Vega. It's established in the movie that Vega is 26 light years away. So, the signal leaves Earth in 1936, and should arrive in 1962 (Earth time.) Assuming that the movie is set in 1997, when it was made, that means the Vegans replied in 1971 (Earth time.) Let's see. They know there are other civilizations in space. That's established in the movie. But when they receive a signal, it takes them 9 years (Earth time) to decide to respond? Wouldn't they have a standing protocol? You know - receive a signal, respond to it. Something like that. Why would it take so much time to decide to respond?It's also awfully convenient that the Vegans decide to help Carter Joss in his mission of convincing Arroway about the importance of faith. Good question from the Committee: ""They take you all the way to Vega, then give you no physical evidence to prove that you've been there?"" True - the movie explains that: ""that's how it's been done for millions of years."" How convenient.I haven't even mentioned the mysterious multi-billionaire who lives on a plane that hardly ever lands and finances the Vega project, and the building of ""the machine.""

29,ThomasDrufke,"Sometimes Cerebral, Sometimes Silly. Ultimately, It's a Missed Opportunity",6,9 November 2016,"With all the fun popcorn sci-fi movies we get each year, I think people forget how interesting and cerebral science-fiction can be. Contact is an ambitious look at the lengths of our universe and our human reach, but it sometimes gets a little too obsessed with itself to make a great watch.Directed by the great Robert Zemeckis and stars Oscar winning Jodie Foster as Dr. Arroway, a scientist who first discovers a potential connection to a life form from an unidentifiable place. Contact is mostly a film about a young girl devoting her life to the research and passion of her late father, but it deals with some heavy themes and ideas. Some ideas are perhaps way to grand scale and broad for the film's grasp, but at its core I really dug the bond between a father and his daughter here. David Morse plays her father in a limited role, but his presence is felt throughout the film.Jodie Foster's performance as Dr. Arroway is also a highlight. As much as it appears this is an ensemble piece with established actors, this film is largely on her shoulders, and she always kept me engaged. Unfortunately, her character is given a love interest in Matthew McConaughey's character, Palmer Joss. It's one thing to have a one- note character as a love interest. But it's even worse to have that very character ONLY be used when the plot feels like it needs the audience to be more invested in an ""emotional moment"". The Joss character is merely a plot device and is a hindrance on the enjoyment of Contact as a whole.But Joss wasn't the only highly flawed character. As Arroway gets closer to analyzing the 'aliens' message to the humans, a character named S.R. Hadden secretly meets with Arroway. This scene, along with every scene he appears in, is completely tonally out of place. This is Contact's biggest issue. The film's first half is tonally balanced and grounded in realism (at least for sci-fi), but once Hadden enters the picture it feels much more heightened than it does grounded. His character seems like a villain straight out of a Bond film, and that just didn't fit in with the rest of the story.I like what this film challenges us to think about and explore. And to its credit, the third act's payoff is truly unlike anything I have seen before, so there's no shortage of originality there. But to me, the writing with a few characters and unbalanced tone is what really killed my enjoyment after awhile.+Foster+Harrowing journey full of intriguing reveals-But the tone is all over the place-As are the writing for certain characters6.6/10",Contact
30,g-bodyl,Great Performance By Jodie Foster!,9,13 February 2013,"Robert Zemeckis's Contact is actually a better film than I expected. For some reason, I was expecting this film to be a romance film with sci-fi elements added. Thankfully, this film turned out more to be an emotional drama with heartfelt performances and a chance to ask the viewer, ""can this be real?"" This film reminded me of Close Encounters of a Third Kind and in a good way. These films have positive messages on the outlook of what happens if aliens visited Earth.This film is about a very smart scientist who finally makes contact with a civilization not of this world. After dealing with skepticism, she finally convinces the world that all this is real. Tha aliens sends plans for the world to build a complex machine. What happens next? This movie features an all-star cast led by a powerful performance of Jodie Foster. I thought Matthew McConaughey was over-publicized because he wasn't in this film as much as I thought he would be but he still was pretty good. The supporting cast is one of the better supporting casts you would want to see in a film.Overall, this is a really good, thought-provoking sci-fi film. It has great visuals and they brought me to a sense of awe and wonder and truly made me think about if any other life exists and the ongoing battle between science and religion.

34,The-Sarkologist,Can one have God and Aliens?,7,18 November 2011,"A film by Robert Zemekis, the guy who directed Back to the Future, and it is not the expected norm. Where as Back to the Future was pulp science-fiction, Contact is a movie that asks lots of questions: what is the nature of truth? how much do we really know? And is it really wise to disregard things because we cannot prove them? The movie is about contact with aliens. It is set now (as Bill Clinton is president of the United States and makes numerous appearances). Contact is made with aliens and they send us information on how to build a device to send us elsewhere. Much of the movie is built around the debate of whether we should build the device and who should be the first human being to go rather than actually meeting the aliens. The meeting does form the climax of the movie but that is not the end for the movie goes beyond this to the nature of evidence and reality. It even raises an eyebrow to the possibility of a government cover-up.Are we really ready to Contact extra-terrestrial life? This is one of the themes and it is explored. When Alloway (Jodie Foster) is with the aliens, they seem assured that not revolutionary change is ready to happen. The government is quite upset that Alloway did release the information of the message to the world before the government could examine it. This basically brought out everybody from UFO freaks to fundamentalist religious fanatics who felt threatened that their power would be destroyed.But does the existence of extra-terrestrial life deny the existence of God. Contact doesn't think so. The aliens, even though they are much more advanced that we are, admit that not even they understand the origins of much of the universe. One of the main characters in the movie is a religious author. He spends a lot of time attacking technology for he says that we seek this to search for meaning in our lives but in fact it leaves us emptier than before. He becomes involved in the project and sits on the selection committee for choosing the first person to encounter the aliens. He is convinced that God exists and the existence of aliens does not alter that.The search for meaning is another theme that comes out. This is not as dominant but it exists. It is mentioned by the religious man near the beginning and is also mentioned by the aliens. We feel alone in the universe so we reach out to try and find others. It will change us a little but the emptiness is still there. The movie seems to tell us that relationship will fill the emptiness, but that is not true.The writers really don't understand the true nature of Christianity. The religious man didn't really seem to understand his belief. When he was asked to prove it, he was left at a stand still: all he could do was to ask Alloway to prove that she loved her father. This, to me, is not a response of one who is supposed to be as mature as he was. A mature Christian would reply that God's existence is proved in creation, but that is not important for the real proof comes with Christ and his death on the cross for us. The question of whether God exists or nor is moot; rather the important point is what he did for us.Contact is not a film arguing religion though. Though I did not appreciate the way that the religious man was portrayed (he would not have slept with Alloyway the first night he met her), this really takes a back seat for it is the contact with the aliens and the questions that are raised that is important in this movie.There is quite a lot in this movie, and I have only scratched the surface in this examination. It is nothing like the pulp that was produced by Zemekis a few years ago (though I do quite enjoy Back to the Future – and even that raises questions and even provides answers) and is rally a high quality piece of film making. Questions are raised and there is much to think about in this movie and it is one that could raise some very interesting conversations with non-Christians.",Contact

37,howard.schumann,Consistently engaging and thought-provoking,9,2 February 2013,"In some indigenous societies, the Milky Way is regarded as the road to the afterworld, the millions of stars in the night sky reflecting the souls of the deceased. Several extinct Native American Indian tribes whose beliefs are preserved in their mythology also imagine the spirits of the dead simply flying up out of their bodies to join other souls in the stars moving across the firmament. In Egypt, by the Middle Kingdom, tomb art began to depict star charts and it was thought that anyone who was given the correct burial rites could become a celestial body upon death.Though there is much room for interpretation, the association of stars with the deceased is suggested in Robert Zemeckis' ground breaking science-fiction film Contact. Based on the late astronomer Carl Sagan's 1985 novel, Contact is a big-budget film that has all the stunning visual effects (and some Forrest Gump-like gimmicks) one would associate with this kind of project but it also has much more. It is a consistently engaging and thought-provoking film that includes a strong ensemble cast. Two-time Oscar winner Jodie Foster brings a ton of passion and conviction to the role of young scientist Ellie Arroway and we are never in doubt that she is the probing, determined seeker after truth that she is portraying.Other strong performances come from James Woods as the overbearing National Security Adviser Michael Kitz who perhaps has seen too many Hollywood movies about bug-eyed monsters, John Hurt as oddball Billionaire financier S. R. Hadden, and Tom Skerritt as the ego-centered David Drumlin, the President's National Science adviser, who wants a piece of the action and the fame that goes with it. The film begins with a gorgeous sequence allowing us to visualize what it would be like to go on a tour of the universe (minus other tourists, of course). We take one small step for mankind as we visit the Moon, pay our respects to Mars, the Roman God of War, sweep through the asteroid belt, glide past Jupiter, become dazzled by the rings of Saturn, then head for places unknown and undreamt of in our philosophy.When we come back to Earth, we find ourselves in the 1970s as nine-year-old Ellie Arroway (Jean Malone) eagerly listens for messages on her short-wave radio as her father Ted (David Morse) offers encouragement. After her father's sudden death, Ellie dedicates her life to carry on her father's wish to probe the mysteries that science has not yet explained. Fast forward about fifteen years where a now mature Ellie (Jodie Foster) is a researcher for the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute, the program where radio signals are sent out to space seeking a coded response from any intelligent life in the universe that happens to have their radios on listening to Beyoncé.Although philosopher/author Terence McKenna proclaimed that, ""To search expectantly for a radio signal from an extraterrestrial source is probably as culture bound a presumption as to search the galaxy for a good Italian restaurant,"" it is during the course of this experiment that a radio signal from a star system 26 light years away provides instructions for building a machine for intergalactic travel, the means to forever end humanity's cosmic isolation. Securing private funding, the machine is built and the era of space exploration begins, though the results are nothing like you imagined.To its credit, Contact does not limit itself to the scientific aspects of Ellie's voyage to the stars but also focuses on her growth as a person. Although the obligatory romance between Ellie and religious scholar Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey) is tacked on unconvincingly, it does not detract from Ellie's ability to transcend the limitations of both science and religion and learn to appreciate, in the words of one African tribe, ""the thing that knowledge can't eat."" The question of belief in God comes up often in the film and Ellie's ""lack of faith"" is used to initially prevent her from being selected as the first space traveler but her deeply personal experience in space and her response to the awesome beauty of what she witnesses renders the question of belief irrelevant.Contact is an intelligent and often moving exploration of subjects Hollywood steers away from ninety percent of the time: Who are we and what is our place in the universe? Are we alone or one species among many? (Sagan said, ""If we are alone, it would be an awful waste of space."") What happens when we die? How will people react to contact if and when it occurs? The film, however, does not provide answers or tell us how to think and what to believe. What it asks of us rather is that we awake to the realization that we live in a universe that is full of mystery, one that may be very different from the one in which we have been taught to believe, and that the cosmos may now be beckoning to us to come home.",Contact
38,TheMovieDiorama,Contact creatively communicates faith through science and mathematics.,7,6 December 2018,"A universal language that transcends both time and space. One that enables any civilisation to communicate with another. Sure, colossal radars and technological innovations are required to personify these signals in an attempt to contact intelligent life, but the premise remains the same throughout. It's not evidence that drives us. The need for proof. It's not even the sense of achievement. It's faith. Whether we believe in a supreme being or not, faith is in all of us. When things go awry, we rely on the smallest ounce of belief. Zemeckis' epitome of 90s science fiction uniquely explores this, albeit occasionally heavy handedly. A scientist finds strong evidence of extraterrestrial life and makes a case for being the chosen human to make first contact. The duality between science and religion, including its cultural conflicts, is the spine of the narrative. Traversing the idea that if intelligent life did exist, does that diminish the existence of God? Several perspectives are portrayed, from the hysterical to the cynical. However, it's the protagonist's faith that is tested to which we see a great deal of development. She puts her faith in the aliens when a set of instructions are subliminally communicated to us, although conveniently solved. Foster was excellent in portraying this, acting as both passionate and fragile. Woods and Fichtner also deserve some credit, whilst McConaughey's performance was slightly lacklustre. Zemeckis' focus on visual effects, especially in the mesmerising third act, adds that layer of mysticism. Enhancing the enigmatic story even further. Yet, the selection questioning scene, which highlighted the protagonist's atheism, was too obvious in presenting its themes and felt unnecessary. Also, after the climactic ending, the fact that her recording device recorded static for 18 hours removes any ambiguity that the film wanted to present. An open conclusion is absolutely suitable for science fiction, and I wish Zemeckis was brave enough to retain that ambiguity. Still, a glorious philosophical journey.",Contact

42,jzappa,A Life-Affirming Epic Imagining Universal Concerns We All Have,9,16 February 2009,"Contact is a $90 million outer space film made by Hollywood with major stars from the director of Who Framed Roger Rabbit and the Back to the Future trilogy, and yet has a profound effect that no viewer can escape, a universal concern that we all have. Is it not probable that intelligent life exists somewhere else in the universe? And, what would have to happen for people to reject belief in a god?There is a fascinating point at which the story becomes ambiguous. After two hours of watching Jodie Foster's earnest, ambitious and brilliant heroine fight to discover life beyond earth, she has an experience that cannot be explained with full certainty, neither by the filmmakers or the audience, yet it affirms our life and our existence, that even if we ever make contact with alien life, we may only find that sharing existence with them is all that makes it feel significant. The film is a spectacle, yes, but there is so much surrounding that spectacle, the explosions, whorls of light, and tragic and infuriating midpoint of the story. It is a narrative expression, and incidental elegy, of Carl Sagan's work and ideas, urging human beings to realize that we are not core essence of existence, that we are an infinitesimal fraction. It is a deeply upsetting thought to many people, but it only makes our millions of years of survival and persistence unthinkable and dear.Robert Zemeckis's often under-appreciated philosophical epic clearly pivots the question of whether intelligent life exists on other planets, but it also explores how belief is proved. And regardless of the build-up to its cataclysmal climax, it doggedly hinges upon that theme. Foster and the character of Matthew McConaughey's function as counterpoints to each other, seeming at first to be a token subplot concerning badly gratuitous love interests, but their relationship develops far, far beyond that. They are an important dynamic that balances her striving for palpable evidence and unrelenting intellectualizing with his dogmatic point of view through faith and personal feelings. The movie is honest and loyal to what is historically proved to be realistic in its view of religion and science clashing constantly throughout the story, with some surprisingly rough consequences.Foster's methodical crusade is lonely, just like we are all alone. She just happens to be more in touch with this formidable feeling. Her boss, a corporate attention whore played by Tom Skerritt, tells her the field of search for extraterrestrial life is professional suicide. But that's the only reason she's in this profession. She's made fun of, but her consumption sits complicated with personal obsessions. With her father, played with very real vibes by David Morse, she shared the enthusiasm of picking up obscure station signals on their amateur radio apparatus. He died while she was still young, and she became unflappable that by some means, sooner or later, she could contact him. This belief is at issue with the certitude that she does not believe in God or the paranormal. Her search for extraterrestrial life is her interpretation of that childhood right. Contemplating the infinity and inscrutability of the universe, you're inclined to clarify it with a supposition like God, but one doubts that a God isn't a redaction that fosters our self-worth in the face of something around which we cannot get our mind.Movies like Contact clarify why most sci-fi blockbusters and other humanistically solipsistic space films relinquish me with dry and unfulfilled feelings. When I look up at the sky at night, when I see footage of the arrival of the research vehicles on Mars or the moon, when I read about astronomy and its variants that deal with its overall configuration and evolution, I graze a mental phoenix. Space and time are so immeasurable in all respects, and our existence is so momentary, that all we know is like one infinitesimal clue in an unimaginably colossal black, well, space. Has another life-sustaining world existed and determined more? We've only been listening for roughly forty years. A beacon's probability of getting to us at the fitting time are so far flung. Can one really allow their preexisting faiths obstruct them from the natural curiosity and inconceivable astonishment?Zemeckis fills his movie with formulaically defined but nonetheless interesting characters, played by particularly good actors. There is John Hurt's enigmatic billionaire who spends his life in the skies within his jet, landing only sparingly. He follows Foster's search and beckons his own boundless assets. And there are two presidential advisers, James Woods and Angela Bassett, who, in the ritual of American alien movies, see the signals as a likely menace to earth. But the film's honest depiction of the world's most influential ideologies in the chasm of its own, their consideration of an alien threat seems more of a real-life likelihood than that of Hollywood.",Contact
43,Vartiainen,Excellent film about the spirituality of science,8,17 July 2015,"Contact, based on Carl Sagan's novel of the same name, encourages us to question what it would truly mean if we found out that we might not be alone in the universe. Oftentimes it's seen as though the only people who would be called to handle such a discovery would be the leading scientists and the politicians. Contact argues that the scope would be much larger than that, because the impact of finding that we did not evolve alone nor were we created alone would affect us on all levels, both rational and spiritual.And for the most part the film handles these ideas and questions very well. The story is told from the point of view of Eleanor Arroway (Jodie Foster), who is one of the foremost astronomers in the world and who has taken it upon herself to search for signs of extraterrestrial life. And one day she hears a signal in the darkness of space, a signal that cannot have come from any human source. Coded within that signal the human race finds blueprints for a machine.The film takes great cares to keep the religious aspect of this discovery relevant to the plot. Matthew McConaughey's character Palmer Joss, a renowned Christian philosopher, is central in this undertaking, but personally I find his constant presence somewhat problematic from the point of view of the story because he's often railroaded back into the plot to spout his point of view and opinions. The film needs him to explore its themes, but he is handled somewhat clumsily as a character, thus making his message less effective.I'm also one of those people that really don't like the ending. And there are people that absolutely love it, but it's one of those endings that divides opinions left and right. I find it to be overly sentimental and to undermine the overall message of hope and discovery the movie has. But then again, some people find the biggest source of hope to be the ending itself and they like how the film gives the choice for them to decide what they want to believe. Bottom line being that you have to see the film and decide what you think about it.Contact is a fantastic science fiction film. It's got one of the greatest minds of the century behind its story, making it far deeper and thought-provoking than almost any film of its genre. I personally dislike some of Sagan's tenets, but I cannot dismiss the thought he has put into them. And that makes this film more than worthy of being watched and appreciated.",Contact
44,FiendishDramaturgy,"Enjoyable, though not for all ages.",8,16 April 2008,"The controversy generated by this movie is astounding. Many claim that the ages-old battle between Church and Science, began with Carl Sagan; an outrageous lie of ignorance, at best. The fundamental differences in belief go back as far as the days of Constantine and court magicians. Alchemists were persecuted by the Church for heretical acts, and ... oh, but this is useless.This film goes a long way towards outlining the governmental interferences known to take place between ufologists and ""real"" scientists who, infuriatingly, side with the Church where extraterrestrial life is concerned...or they did until the last few years. Now, it is considered acceptable to admit that there ""may be"" other life out there, and many of Sagan's theories are considered an axiom today, such as his often-quoted philosophy, that ""...if humans are the only life in the universe it would be a terrible waste of space."" At the heart of Contact, you are taken along one woman's journey to self-discovery, but all around her, others are making their own discoveries, even if they are too selfish and duplicitous to share them with her. Often, in real life, these people are just too self-involved to realize that they have HAD an epiphany and it soon goes away.But at any rate, Contact delivers awesome entertainment, some poignant drama, and a fluid and stylistic presentation from Sagan and Zemeckis. It's a bit dated, but not so much as to detract from one's enjoyment. This is a really good movie, with a decent budget, and it enjoys an impressive rating here at IMDb (to be so preachy). I would say it would be a decent Friday/Saturday night's viewing, as long as the subject matter is appealing to the audience.Foster delivers a genuine performance in which the viewer has no choice but to subscribe to her character, and become embroiled in her intrigue. A top row performance, but I have never seen Foster give any less, even as a child star.Fichtner is a tremendous talent as a character actor, and he does not fail herein to engage. You should check out some of his other, more flamboyant, performances. That man can ACT! It was lovely to see him again.I found it enjoyable, though not for all ages, as some portions and aspects of the story may confuse and/or distress younger viewers.It rates a 7.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Contact
45,thinker1691,""" You must think like a Vegan, which means, functioning on Multiple Levels """,8,15 July 2009,"Among the most notable men of Science in our century, Carl Segan must surely earned his place as one of the greatest. It would have been a great privilege, Indeed, an honor, to have met him. Sadly, those who did not take advantage of his presence, lost more than an opportunity. It comes as no surprise then, when having the chance to read his book, "" Contact "" or at least seeing the movie, many more did not. What a loss. The movie is to say the least awesome and inspirational as it translates the thoughts of Mr. Sagan himself. The story is of a young girl named Eli Arroway, the pride and joy of her scientist father Dr. Ted Arroway, played sympathetically by David Morse. She grows up to be present when Earth receives it's first interstellar message from outer space. She would have been out-of-luck and dealt quickly out of the game 'of the millennium ' had it not been for her benefactor, powerful S.R.Hadden. (John Hurt) Innicially, selected to be the first Representative from Earth to go on an incredible journey across Time and Space, to another Galaxy, she is abruptly and rudely replaced by her boss, David Drumlin (Tom Skerritt) who goes first. (Literally) James Woods plays the tiresome Government heavy Michael Kitz who seems to be everywhere as chief of paranoia. Regardless of what positive good Arroway expects, Kitz suspects only the worse. The Galatic expanse the audience views while on board the space craft, is enough to bring out the poet in anyone with imagination. The film is nothing short of fantastic, darkly interesting and educational as Sagan would have wanted it. I believe when man lands on Mars, one of the first cities we establish there will be named after him. Great film and a future Classic. ****",Contact
46,strong-122-478885,"Ellie Returns To Pensacola, Florida",5,15 May 2015,"For me - Contact was definitely one of those pseudo-renegade, Sci-Fi pictures that, when I carefully weighed it pluses and minuses, got itself split right down the middle, for the most part.Here are 2 things that lost Contact some very serious points - (1) Ellie's super-nauseating, on/off relationship with the 2-faced man-of-the-cloth, Palmer Joss (and, yes, that included the whole recycled business of his gift to Ellie of a cheap, toy compass from a box of Cracker Jack).(2) The images that were used in the film which placed the then-US President, Bill Clinton, right into the story. I can't believe that this would be allowed.I clearly see these images of Clinton as being something of a conflict of interest, especially since it not only gave me the indication that Clinton was fully endorsing Contact on the side of the Christians, but it got me to wondering whether he might have received monetary payment for permitting his images to be used this way.On the other hand - Besides Contact delivering some acceptably impressive visual effects and its story holding up fairly well in the intelligence department - I also liked some of the questions that it raised, such as - (1) Is the world really a better place because of science and technology? (This question, of course, goes double for whether the world is a better place because of religion) (2) Does science really reveal that ""God"" never existed? - If the answer to this is ""Yes"", then, that means that close to 95% of the world's population is made up of people who suffer from a mass delusion.",Contact
47,ebiros2,Masterpiece of Sci-Fi,7,8 September 2011,"I'm not a big fan of Carl Sagan, but the way they made this movie makes it a master piece of a drama, and a science fiction.There's no one element that stands out in this movie (except the excellent deliveries by Jodi Foster), but everything being done at such high quality is what makes this movie a gem from the '90s. On location scenes are beautiful, as are the in studio scenes. Character development in the story is excellent with each character getting their place in the story. That's pretty much all the element you need to make a fine science fiction movie.One other thing that stands out is that there's no conflict in this movie except human ones. It's not about war, destruction, or hysteria that drives the story. It's about new frontier, and first contact.

The movie has an interesting premise and Jodie Foster is as usual excellent as a scientist who wants to prove that she has made contact with extraterrestrials, but the story itself is almost laughable and even allowing for literary license, which in this movie runs wild, renders the movie ultimately mediocre. The movie wants the audience to accept certain premises that so defy the laws of physics that when Ms. Foster's character is challenged as to the credibility of her findings, well, frankly, she fails so completely to make a case that the movie became pointless. One other thing, the movie portrays the construction of a contraption for space travel that resembles two huge hula hoops. Hence, I nickname this movie the Hula Hoops movie.",Contact
49,ackstasis,"""You feel so lost, so cut off, so alone, only you're not""",7,14 February 2010,"In the late 1990s, Hollywood turned its eye once again to the stars. 'Independence Day (1996)' was a bombastic throwback to popcorn disaster movies, in which an alien civilisation attempts to annihilate the human race in a puff of fiery explosions. 'Deep Impact (1998)' and 'Armageddon (1998)' both entailed meteors on a collision-course with Earth. What was it that made us look up again? It certainly wasn't the threat of nuclear war, or the Space Race, both of which had fuelled the 1950s boom in science-fiction. Perhaps the approaching dawn of a new millennium had evoked in us the sheer insignificance of our own daily situations, casting our minds to previous generations, to an entire race and to other races beyond our terrestrial cradle. It was inevitable that filmmakers would return to Stanley Kubrick's science-fiction masterpiece, '2001: A Space Odyssey (1968),' its titular year – then on the cusp of fruition – signaling a new age for Mankind. You'll forgive me if my review makes frequent allusions to '2001,' for Robert Zemeckis' Contact (1997)' feels, in many ways, like a feeble imitation of Kubrick's film. In both stories, the human race discovers evidence of a distant extraterrestrial civilisation, and attempts to make contact. Each film creates a sense of awe at the incalculable immensity of the Universe, and Man's own infinitesimal place within it {'Contact' does this via a wonderful computer-generated ""zoom-out"" through the solar system and the Milky Way}. However, though I admire Zemeckis and Carl Sagan for taking their ideas further than most science-fiction films, I often found the film's approach clumsy and unconvincing. 'Contact' is strongest in its opening half, when SETI astronomer Dr. Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) discovers what is believed to be radio communication from an interstellar race. The moment of first radio contact is invigoratingly suspenseful, offering some small sense of the excitement that Jerry Ehman must have felt when the ""Wow! signal"" came through in 1977. Zemeckis, ever the technical wizard, orchestrates a marvellous long-take that follows Foster from her car, through the observatory entrance, and into the laboratory.As 'Contact' strays farther from contemporary reality, it begins to get bogged-down by tiresome theistic philosophy. '2001' addressed the topic of religion only peripherally, almost dismissively; it was Arthur C. Clarke's stance that any sufficiently-advanced civilisation would be indistinguishable from God (making the notion of God almost redundant). 'Contact' tries to pander to two camps, carefully engineering a scenario by which there is no empirical evidence for Jodie Foster's experience, and then introducing empirical evidence, anyway. The climax, which unfolds following a Douglas Trumbull-inspired wormhole, is interesting, but far too safe: using a human avatar to represent the extraterrestrial race is a clumsy way of avoiding having to show them, and simply reminds the viewer that they're watching a movie. Kubrick did it better thirty years earlier, housing Dave Bowman in a Louis XVI-style enclosure that is familiar yet eerily sterile. In fact, watching 'Contact' has, if nothing else, made me appreciate just how much I love '2001,' forever the pinnacle of science-fiction achievement.",Contact
50,XweAponX,Science and Religion both use Faith,10,10 May 2014,"Mostly out of respect for Carl Sagan I rate this 10 - It is in fact a diamond in the rough as others have said.As far as Production Value, the state of CGI Graphics when this film was made was poor - It could have been done better. That was the one thing that bothered me, some of the CGI was great, but at the time CGI was no good for planes, ships or a huge rotating Gyroscope. It was good however for storms and galaxies and planets.But despite this minor flaw, the sets were very well done, including Jody's ""spaceship"" and the structures surrounding it. But what drives this film is not how it looks, there are strong and weak aspects to that. What really drives this story is Character, and the fact that we ourselves can relate to the dichotomies presented here.Basically all through this film, Dr. Arroway refuses to see the merits of Faith, she only relies on what can be proved with Facts in Hand. But Faith in God cannot be accessed that way.This rigid thinking initially allows her to make her big discovery, but when it comes to the row she created and taking part in her own discovery, it prevents her from being originally picked as the person to represent man as a whole. We have Nick Lowe on one side representing the Conservative POV, and Matthew McConaughey on the other, who should be representing the Conservative/Religious POV but in fact Ms. Foster's character cannot see that he is actually her most valuable ally.This is how both Science and Religion should tread, they are in fact not at odds with each other, they complement each other. I think this was Carl Sagan's final statement with this book and film. Both require Faith to make work and if allowed to, Science and Religion can be used together to answer questions that neither alone can answer.I personally believe that if a machine like the one in the film were built, we would experience it differently from Within and Without.James Woods as the NSA chief almost reprises his great role as ""Citizen Cohn"" and Tom Skerritt reveals a Political Ass-Kisser and chump who is not above taking Arroway's discovery and using it for political gain, even while standing in her way earlier in the film. John Hurt in another chameleon role is SR Hadden, a mysterious recluse and main Arroway ally.And as much as Matt McConaughey bothers me, his character is pivotal to the film, as well as Gary Busey prodigy Jake as the psychotic religious fanatic which he so well represents. I believe all stereotypes are accounted for using appropriate actors.This film is worth sitting through, even though it moves slowly. Not many movies or TV shows lately have such a positive message to expound as this, but the source material and author says it all.",Contact
51,Lechuguilla,Contemporary Hollywood Garbage,1,9 August 2009,"It gets off to a good start. A noisy Earth recedes into space as the silence of an implacable universe overwhelms the senses. And I must say that a SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) inspired story could have had real promise. But most everything else about this film reeks of modern Hollywood garbage. They took the novel of a a respected astronomer, Carl Sagan, and turned his work into cinematic junk.Jodie Foster is a fine actress, and I like her. But she's the wrong person for the role she plays. Except for her character and the blind researcher, none of the characters are sympathetic. I couldn't stand that Drumlin person (played by Tom Skerritt). Smarmy Matthew McConaughey is super annoying, and his role is unnecessary. But much, much worse are the cameo appearances of real-life boob tube personalities and assorted real-life politicians, offering their ""comments"" on Earth's contact with ET. Are we, as viewers, supposed to be impressed with this showy display of ""teevee"" celebrities? Their presence is nauseating.Not only do these self-important, disingenuous talking heads date the film, their tiresome faces and hackneyed babble sabotage whatever other-worldly mood or atmosphere the film, as sci-fi, could have imparted. Every time one of these pompous ""know-it-alls"" came on the screen, I fast-forwarded the DVD.The film's big-budget grandstanding is unbelievable: overblown special effects, irksome engineering lingo, huge sets, every acting extra in existence plus his or her extended family, background music that is highly manipulative, and on and on and on. Yet, for all the ninety million dollar budget, the film's climax is an unimaginative cop out that conveys no useful or original insights.Bombastic in presentation, and very pleased with itself, ""Contact"" is what I would have expected from a Ron Howard movie: big-budget, ostentatious visuals, a story that lacks thematic depth, and aimed at an audience of fourteen-year-old boys and clueless adults.

I have not read the novel with which this movie is based off of, but I don't think I need to in order to see the greatness of this movie. It tells the story of Dr. Eleanor Arroway, a radio astronomer who hears a signal over her radio that she thinks might be aliens trying to contact them, hence the title. Once the signal is researched further, of course, the United States government and other international governments get involved and want to know what it means. The plot might sound like just another simple cookie cutter alien film, but I found Contact to be much more. The script is written in a way that allows for plenty of character development and depth. This is in no way a simple film, it is complex and will keep your attention the whole way through. The filmmakers make you care deeply about Jodie Foster's character. I love how they showed her as a child and they displayed her close relationship with her father. This plays a key role later on in the movie. The acting by every actor in the film is very good too. Jodie Foster gives a very powerful and gripping performance that touches the audience. Matthew is also good here, this is the first major film he ever did.

56,rooprect,"""Science without religion is lame. Religion without science is blind.""",7,23 December 2012,"The quote in my title comes from Albert Einstein, and I get the feeling that Sagan agrees.Carl Sagan's story ""Contact"" approaches the age-old cosmic debate of science vs. religion. That is the strength of this film, and it presents some very lucid points. Without ruining anything, I'll say that the film illustrates an interesting grey area where both overlap. Namely: the realm of doubt.It shows that both sides can fall prey to fanaticism, and both sides are often guilty of close-mindedness. While Sagan definitely chooses his own side and hammers it home at the end, the film still remains objective enough that you can see the validity of both teams. I really enjoyed that side of the film.But the weakness of this film is that it falls back to a standard crowd-pleaser with a superficial romance, a predictable government villain (I suspect Sagan was venting his own personal frustrations at political intervention), and a sentimental family story which detract from the cosmic experience this film promises.If you're familiar with the films ""E.T."" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" you probably know how different they are. Both are good films, but ""E.T."" is mostly entertainment while ""2001"" is a philosophical puzzle. Here in ""Contact"" it feels like they set out to give us ""2001"" but they ended up with ""E.T."" In the director's commentary, the filmmakers admit to making some rather non-scientific compromises in order to keep the audience dazzled.For example, there's sound in space. Ugh! Why do they always do that? Kubrick showed us in 1969 that he could respect physics (no sound in space) and still keep us on the edge of our seats with suspense; in fact the silence of space made it even more chilling. Audiences aren't as dumb as Hollywood thinks we are. Or are we?I'd say this film is above average in terms of science fiction but below average in terms of science. Its main flaw is that it falls in the empty space between the two. It probably isn't action-packed enough for straightforward entertainment, and it's not quite heady enough to be philosophy. But it makes you think, and that's the mark of a successful film.If you enjoy ""Contact"" and find yourself craving something deeper, I highly recommend ""2001"" (the grandfather of all thinking films), ""THX-1138"" (before Lucas turned sappy), ""Solaris"" (either version, I actually prefer the remake) and ""2010"" (the sequel to 2001, not nearly as good but a worthy effort).",Contact

And a struggle between science and theology about in which aspects to view the signal. Ellen Arroway finds that her fiercest opponent David Drumlin, suddenly takes credit for her work and makes and has a personal agenda. And then there is Palmer Joss, a theologist with a completely different view on the world compared to Ellie, but still there is something going on between the two. Everything is suddenly very hard to do, but her mysterious benefactor has an uncanny ability to find a clue for her every time the projects threaten to come to a standstill.Comments: A very visually beautiful movie with deep philosophical questions with a lot of different interpretations. But it is not therefore I love this movie. I love this movie because of the sense of wonder, the curiosity and the feeling of exploration. It manages successfully to transport me along with Ellie, to feel her awe and curiosity, both when she is in the desolate desert watching the star filled sky and listening to the radio sources of the sky, and when she is going on her (or did she, decide yourself) trip to see all the alien places. And, just having watched the movie again tonight, knowing what is going to happen, I still get the same sense of curiosity. Just love it! As stated, the movie is very beautiful (and a little sad from time to time) using special effects very successfully. And that it manages to convey those emotions, is proof of a very well directed movie. Along with very good acting from the cast it makes the movie complete (yes, it got a great story as well). Foster is great in the lead, she just has one little cheesy moment that keeps her from giving a stellar (hehe) performance. McConaughey gives a flawless performance too, but in my opinion, the best performances is given by actors in smaller supporting roles, namely Morse, Fichtner and Busey. Morse is just great as Ellie's dad, Busey perfect as a madman. Also like Woods as a cynical government official.Well, I could go on, but I won't. I'll just say. Watch it. It is a great journey.10/10",Contact

62,davidmvining,Zemeckis' best movie,10,23 November 2020,"This is one of those movies where I know from the opening shot that I'm watching something incredibly special. The opening is so unique, confident, clear, and effective that I know I'm in the exact right hands to tell this story. Robert Zemeckis took over the pre-production efforts after the studio fired George Miller, was granted full artistic control including final cut, and built off of what Miller had established to tell the filmed version of Carl Sagan's novel about alien contact. I'd love to see what Miller would have done, but it's hard to imagine a better combination of director and material than Zemeckis and Contact. Zemeckis is inventive technically on par with Spielberg, has the same kind of gentle humanism throughout his work, but he also is firmer in his commitments to where stories should go.Since I made so much of how this movie starts so well, let me talk about that for a moment. It's an extravagant special effects shot that tracks back from earth, picking up speed and going further and further into deep space, passing out of our planetary system, our galaxy, and even further until we get a sense of how small our world is in the scope of the universe. This is matched by the sound of radio waves, dominated close to earth by contemporary radio and television signals, and going backwards in time until we can hear the first television signal powerful enough to be sent into space some ways away for a half second (that becomes important later). After that, it's silence as we get a stronger sense of just how much space is out there. It's a perfect start to this film.Ellie Arroway is a scientist who works for SETI, using time on large radio telescopes to search the stars for signs of alien life. She's brilliant and eagerly directing her career down a dead end according to David Drumlin, the president's science advisor who has control over funding and satellite time. Eventually fired, Ellie and a small team of like-minded scientists find funding from a large corporation's funding arm, Hadden Industries. Using this money, they listen to the stars until the stars start speaking.There are a couple of personal stories going on at the same time as the plot. The first deals with Ellie's father who died when she was nine. Using flashbacks, we see how her widow father lovingly guided her first steps into searching for answers in the stars with a telescope and a HAM radio. He dies of a heart attack one night when they're supposed to stargaze, and she rejects the local priest's explanation of God's will, but she still misses her father. She still needs answers, so she runs to her radio and calls out to her dad. The other personal story deals with Palmer Joss, a man who left the seminary because he couldn't give up the sins of the flesh, who is writing a book about the lack of meaning in a world dominated by science. He looks and sounds like Matthew McConaughey, so her immediate sensual desire seems to be understandable, but she can't commit. Ellie looks to the stars for meaning, not to the Earth. Science is her God, to put it another way, and she feels like she needs nothing else.Now, to talk about a Robert Zemeckis movie without highlighting at least one great individual sequence feels empty, so I shall tackle that now. The first appearance of the signal from space is great, just so great. It comes as a series of pulses announcing the signal's presence to the world that's listening. Ellie's efforts to speed into the command center from an isolated spot among the 27 radio telescopes, shouting commands over her radio while her fellow scientists try to catch up with her orders, the building music around it, and the frantic early steps and simply trying to capture and verify what they're hearing is an amazing combination of visually effective storytelling, editing, and sound design that stands as one of Zemeckis' finest single sequences. And this movie is only about a third done. There's a lot more greatness to come.The signal from space, that demonstrated intelligence through the use of prime numbers, recalls the attentions of the world, and the US government suddenly descends on Ellie's quiet little stargazing spot. Drumlin arrives alongside the National Security Advisor Michael Kitz. From the moment Drumlin shows up, he's wresting control and the credit away from Ellie, and Ellie barely seems to realize how bad it is. She can see it, but she doesn't realize how hard she needs to fight it. It doesn't help when the first signal has its visual aspects revealed to show Hitler's introduction to the 1936 Olympic Games.Now, one thing this movie does with surprising intelligence is how it handles a variety of reactions from the world to the news. The cults that rise up both in support and in rejection outside the radio telescope farm feel like the sort of mix of crazy humanity would cook up, but they're mostly a sideshow. The central reaction is Ellie's, and she's counterbalanced by Joss. Ellie looks out at these people with a mix of pity, confusion, and a little bit of fear. The irony is that both she and the sideshow carnival are looking towards Vega, the source of the message, as a source of meaning and truth, the exact sort of thing that Joss was saying was absent in our modern science-driven world. Ellie's journey ends up being one of humility and faith as she realizes the limits of her own experience. It ends up recalling Arthur C. Clarke's Third Law: ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.""So, the message has plans for a giant machine hidden inside it. S.R. Hadden, the reclusive billionaire who resembles Howard Hughes (and would be modeled after Elon Musk if made today) figures out the primer to decode the language, and the world is off to spend almost half a trillion dollars to build it. The machine has a capsule that carries one person, and Ellie and Drumlin are both up for the seat. Drumlin, once again, steps on Ellie's toes and she takes it. That's not really a criticism of her character, mind you. Ellie is a professional working in a tough bureaucratic setting. She acts like a professional when she gets outmaneuvered by Drumlin, eventually losing the prized seat to him. It would be out of character for her to, while still working on the project, to break down into tears and recriminations against him. She can do that when her funding gets pulled near the beginning of the film, but not when she's spent time learning to be a team player with a desire to see the project through to the end.When a religious extremist sneaks into the completed site and blows it and Drumlin up, the world thinks it has wasted a gob of money on a project that went nowhere until Hadden shows up with another machine built in Japan. Two machines for the price of two. Ellie ends up the pilot and gets sent through.Now, the movie as a whole gets a lot of praise, but that tends to end when Ellie reaches her destination. The trip out is tense and beautiful in equal measure. The sequence that sends the pod through the machine is another great suspense sequence, but it's when Ellie gets to that beach built off of her memory of a drawing she made of Pensacola as a child and the alien visiting her in the form of her father that people lose faith with the film. They wanted to see an alien, and they see a great alien design, not just David Morse. However, I think that Zemeckis leaned towards the lesson that Kubrick learned while making 2001: A Space Odyssey. No alien will ever life up to the audience's imagination. The design will always be too terrestrial in nature. So, instead of going to spectacle, which he gave in the trip there to the beach, Zemeckis relies heavily on Ellie's emotional journey, and I think it works. Ellie started her love of space mixed with the tragedy of her father's death. Some part of her had mixed the idea of science and the soul into an idea that if she could hear far enough, she could see her dad again, and suddenly there, millions and millions of light years away from Earth, she sees him again. There's an emotional release from her as she fulfills what she had dreamed of as a girl, something relatable to the audience. At the same time, she sees her journey from a cosmic point of view as the first step out of many (there are echoes of Clarke's assertion that we are a child race here).When Ellie comes back, she has no proof over her journey, just her lived experience. She cannot prove that what she saw was real, but she must still try and convince the world that they did not waste their time and money on the project. Her desire to be believed becomes an echo of Joss's earlier arguments in favor of faith in God, a fascinating parallel. She can prove that this machine really did as much as she asserts as well as Joss can prove the existence of God. I imagine it costs a fortune to simply run the machine a single time, so I can understand why people wouldn't be jumping at the prospect of funding another trip just to see if what she said was right.It's a wonderfully intelligent film that embraces complexity in several forms. Acting is really good across the board, especially from Jodie Foster as Ellie. It reaches for a real sense of awe and nearly accomplishes it, which is a hard thing to do in general, all while telling its story well. This is a great film, and it may be the best Zemeckis ever made.",Contact

64,onepotato2,compelling misfire,5,26 November 2007,"The movie has a structure that is very satisfying to keep up with. Where most movies have one, or at the very most two, intriguing developments, this one has nine or ten, that arrive with great regularity. Zemeckis' camera work and tricks (Look again...) are nice and serve the story well. There are scenes in it that make my hair stand on end. I wish after the astonishing trip in the machine that we didn't spend 2 hours getting across the universe, to get a saccharine, anti-climactic homily from dad. And the stupid preachy final scene with religious MacConaghey coming out on top is grating. Someone should have told them ""You don't have an ending."" Unfortunately narrative elements & characters necessary to set up a bunch of bad guys, bog down additional viewings. The movie just has too many a-holes; Tom Skerritt, James Woods, Angela Bassett, Junior Busey, Rob Lowe; I wish this crowd of antagonists wasn't here, because the movie could be so much more than the usual pissing match with some villainous jerk(s). You can't investigate metaphysical beauty while mired in earth-bound pettiness. Would you watch 2001 and decide, ""Boy, could this use a love interest, and a bad scientist!""? Contact quickly becomes burdened with the tiresome religion vs. science debate. Wouldn't the movies be a nice place to be free from the views of the corrupt, immoral religious right?The intertextual casting of Jody Foster as the mannish Ellie Arroway plays uncomfortably off the allegations that she's a lesbian. (i.e. the campy scene where she tells Mattthew McConaghey to leave his number) I'm not hating, my closest friend is a lesbian - but the mating subplot is bizarre to watch. Has anyone ever looked less comfortable with a member of the opposite sex? It makes you think her strategy of choosing leading-man-less, love-less scripts (Panic Room, Flightplan, The Accused, The Brave One, Anna and the King, Nell, Little Man Tate) is the right choice for her. On the other hand, Foster sells the trip with her acting skills.The final straw is the asinine Matthew MacConaghey, in the role of an asinine, babbling, douche-bag/nu-age priest. I cannot bear to watch even a few seconds of this idiot in any movie. No matter what he's trying to portray, what shines through is ""d-u-m-b."" If you dreamt up the complex (ahem...) role of a sexually-active religious figure who is the heroine's antagonist/lover, would you get MacConaghey to play it? The man can barely move his lips correctly to form words. The rest of the movie teems with so much liberal earnestness that this viewer, liberal also, wanted to retch. Every time I watch it, I want to strangle the (over)actor who plays the blind nerd every time he speaks.All of this is unfortunate, because the movie successfully treats science as a wondrous, methodical discipline. I can't name a single other movie that does that.",Contact

66,eric262003,A Spiritually Enhancing Film,9,12 July 2015,"The year 1997 was the year that every movie was below sea level to the classic Hollywood blockbuster ""Titanic"". But one of the more captivating, spiritually enhanced film that came out in that time period was ""Contact"". Under the careful eyes of long-time director Robert Zemekis, ""Contact"" tells the exhilarating story of a brilliant astronomer (Jodie Foster) as she goes on a trivializing quest in search of other living things that go beyond out earthly bubble as she spreads the word that we are not alone in this universe. Dr. Ellie Arroway (Foster) is our protagonist is quite obsessed with finding this difficult question and will stop at nothing to fulfil the question many of us have asked, but never got the concrete answers to. Through all the details in this story, there are a plethora of deeper inner issues in Ellie's quest to search for extraterrestrial beings. in the end of her never ending quest into finding the unknown, we can look at her as an iconic rebel caused by global spectacle.From a very early age, Ellie as fascinated with astronomy. We learn that her mother died when she was very young and her father (David Morse) died while he and a young Ellie were watching a meteor shower fall down upon them. This was her calling card as she had an epiphany that someday,she will contact these extraterrestrials in hope to finally convince humankind that there is more life than meets the eye. Being somewhat iconoclastic in nature, in one of the flashbacks, we discover that the young Ellie tries to reach her deceased father, not from seances or psychic telepathy, but through her transistor radio to see if she can contact him through there. Whereas religious people pray for their parents in heaven, Ellie depends on technological apparatuses to as a spiritual guide beyond the grave. Her sadness is conveyed in the same format as our prayers in church, but with technology as her escape from the cruelty of separation, we can conclude that her grief is correlative to those who pray religiously. By that we can learn a lot from Ellie's reaching out to her deceased father, by which putting our faith in God, we can refrain from our fixations of greed and vanity and to appreciate the things that God has done for us.After Eliie's SETI project is about to be terminated after not finding any proof of alien life, Ellie hurried turns to higher profit moguls to desperately continue her search to contact with her late father. After being turned down by several corporations, Ellie finds reassurance from Hadden Industries, but was turned down once she started talking about her dreams. Although her presentation has lots of accurate details, she gets rejected because her research seems way over the top as science fiction. In other words her vision just doesn't fit the criteria of Haddens. It's like they've heard the same speech, but told differently a hundred times before. They just can't find something in Eliie's speech that has any bite to them. She eventually gets the funding once she get across towards those who were able to listen and to understand her who don't have the same intentions like she does. It raises the attention to the higher corporate echelons including the chief executive officer (John Hurt). After Ellie travels through space get some evidence, she comes back home empty. When forced to ask some heavy-handed questions from the National Inquiry, she can only conclude that through factual technical information, similar to cultural belief, we can only conclude by saying that a claim in nothing more than a simple hypothesis. For the first time in her life she can open up and claim that her research was not experienced through science, but by the facets of faith. Her heartfelt speech in the end can be a statement for a Christian missionary. The language through her speech shows an incredible force from the experience that Ellie went through. And sure her scientific beliefs are contrary to her long-tiring search to find the truth beyond our Earth, there is something that keeps her from going out to spread the truths about our universe. However one thing's for sure, we are all God's children and we all have tales to tell of God's generous, loving and caring personae.",Contact

68,screenman,Involving But A Bit Daft,7,29 May 2011,"Nice Mr Sagan's plodding science-faction novel gets the full treatment by Hollywood. Starring plainest of the Janes, Jodie Foster, as a scientific muse, and Tom Skerritt as her less-than-honourable boss (a hint of 'Silence of the Lambs'); her team discover an incoming signal from outer-space. It is clearly coherent.What follows is an interesting though rather predictable interplay between science, religion and the apparatus of security as to how the thing should be addressed. A maverick billionaire with terminal cancer issues, adds a little spice, as does some Loonytune terrorist who destroys the first machine. The trouble with the movie and indeed the book, is that nobody seems quite sure how to deal with the subject. To make 'Contact' a plausible concept is the need to think like an alien, whilst Hollywood barely knows how to think like an adult human. As a result; the ending is such a made-for-kids cheese-fest that all of the comparatively grown-up stuff which the movie moguls could actually understand from Sagan's original story is pretty-well set at nought.There's a decent cast, which includes John Hurt, who - being the first person to have an 'Alien' burst out of him - seems to have been perennially remembered and short-listed for SF roles ever since. There's plenty of good effects. Sound and vision are well addressed; but ain't it always the case? The moral, political and security issues presented by Sagan are dealt with adequately. Acting, directing and other technical issues are up to snuff. The first 90% is well worth a watch.

Nevertheless director Zemeckis manages to surf through these obstacles avoiding the main barriers but not without leaving a few things partly unexplained. It's the story of a lady scientist and astronomer who is fascinated by the possibility of finding extraterrestrial contacts displaying the existence of (human?) life in other parts of the universe. She meets with enormous difficulties, antagonisms and resistances on that task of hers but also some support from other people and sources. The movie from a certain point on enters in a series of unpredicted events, full of agitation and emotion in which the performance of Jodie Foster as the main protagonist is excellent. In the last part there are some scenes full of visual and factual poetry and beauty.

71,mjw2305,An Agnostic Viewpoint,9,18 January 2005,"This movie is well structured, visually effective and extremely well cast, Jodie Foster captures her characters drive and enthusiasm brilliantly. I have seen this movie numerous times and never tire of its entertaining qualities.OK, so the film is probably not as clever as it thinks it is, but it is certainly not shallow or predictable (as suggested in many comments posted here) and YES it is thought provoking (otherwise why have so many people who claim that it isn't, got so much to say about it.) I do however agree that the ending is contrived, it deliberately withholds vital information (18 Hours of Static) to show that Jodie Foster has learnt to have 'Faith', this was unnecessary.Having read many of the reviews here on IMDb the theme of the reviews seems to revolve far too much around the religious undertones and the battle between faith and science too often. Yes, this would seem to be highly relevant, as it is a strong theme throughout the movie, however this alone is probably not a good enough reason to either love or hate this film. For a start most of the arguments are flawed and some are comically inaccurate, (example 1 - Jodie Foster says she can't believe in god, as there is no data to either support of disprove such a belief, Palmer then asks her to prove she loved her Dad.) Now, i ask you, is belief an emotion? No. So how does this comparison have any rational argument against her failure to believe in God? (example 2 - Jodie Foster says that if the message was religious, then it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a big booming voice from the sky, and Palmer states that that's exactly what it was.) So, if a radio signal received from outside our atmosphere, can be interpreted as 'a religious message' does this mean every phone user hears these 'religious messages' all the time? After all these are radio signals that are satellite relayed around the world from outside our atmosphere. Surely, there are better arguments that could have been used.Anyway, all that aside i really enjoyed this film, simply for its entertainment value and its more realistic approach to an alien civilisation and interaction with other lifeforms in the universe.I give it 9/10, even if it is flawed.",Contact

Somehow, contact with some unknown force does occur, providing an instruction manual for a device.Remember those gyroscopic toys kids used to play with? 'Nuff said. Apparently, this is how to travel through worm holes and what not. The gyro notwithstanding, other special effects are usually interesting, and the story has moments of original revelations to offer.

What she experiences on her journey makes for a poorly contrived finale.The cast act enthusiastically, but their efforts are sunk by characters written as blithering idiots.

Get it at Amazon.)The contact frequency is pi times hydrogen, and the first transmission is the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7.... This is what WE would transmit and do transmit because such signals cannot be mistaken for natural phenomena. It's obvious that what we have here is intelligent science fiction. The general public may be surprised to learn-I know I was-that a significant segment of the scientific community considers the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) a pie in the sky waste of money and human energy. The prejudice is so great that until recently no self- respecting astrophysicist would dare specialize in it for fear of having no career. Well, there are a few brave souls. This is a movie about one of them.I didn't read the book-shame on me, but works of fiction by scientists usually make me blush in embarrassment for their authors. But Carl Sagan was no ordinary scientist, nor was he an ordinary writer. Still I suspect that what made this an excellent movie was the script by James V. Hart and Michael Goldenberg. It is extraordinarily well thought out and carefully crafted with deft turns of plot and a satisfying conclusion, with no need for spaghetti code patches near the end, the bane of most sci-fi and action/adventure flicks. It is also emotionally moving.There is, however, just the slightest ""written by committee"" feel to the movie. Everything is a little too neat and too well explained. It's a paradox of any art form that sometimes you can polish too much, you can overwrite and lose some spontaneity in the production. And yes, Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey) is a little too good to be true, and Arroway (Jodie Foster) really needs a serious fault or at least some kind of vice to round her out. Being a political innocent isn't enough. And the media and governmental reaction is a little too pat and cynical.However all of that is insignificant compared with the most difficult thing about writing a futuristic or ""superior civilization"" story, namely coming up some unknown technology or information to make it seem real. The formula for cold fusion would work, or the cure to cancer. But how can you do THAT?You can't (otherwise what you come up with would probably be more important than your script.) It is fascinating to see how Sagan, Hart, Goldenberg and Director Robert Zemeckis cleverly sidestep this pitfall. Only those who have tried it can know what a fine job was done here. And incidentally Zemeckis can be given credit for making ""Contact"" intelligible without any dumbing down, no mean feat in itself. As far as star Jodie Foster goes, it's clear she inhaled and imbibed the persona of the modern woman of science in preparation for this role, so well does she play the part of astrophysicist Ellie Arroway. They have her come out looking androgynous, which is appropriate for two reasons, one, she lost her mother early and had to identify with her father more than most (an explanation, if one were needed, for how she became a scientist); and two, those little green beings aren't going to be men or women, having given up our sort of primitive sexuality long ago. She is never glamorized; even when she dresses up, she still looks like a normal woman in a gown. And she is appropriately unpolitical and naive and far too honest in front of the camera, something the real Jodie Foster is not.Best line: ""It's so beautiful. They should have sent a poet.""",Contact

Still, whatever you want to call ""Contact"", it represents thoughtful, intelligent film-making.Jodie Foster is perfect for the role of Ellie Arroway. The character is written as an intelligent, articulate and passionate woman, just as Ms Foster herself appears to be. Sure, that doesn't require much of an acting stretch, and I think I've accidentally hit on the reason I don't like Foster much as an actress, despite most of her films and performances being good. You never get the sense that she is stepping outside herself to portray the character, her persona is always there. Her best role in my opinion is one of her first, as Iris in ""Taxi Driver"", when nobody knew who she was and she couldn't trade off an established profile of herself, as she has done in much of her later work.(SPOILERS)Back to the film. ""Contact"" is intelligently written, with an engaging cast of supporting characters besides Foster. Creditable actors such as Tom Skerrit and James Woods lend their considerable nous to the project. One of my favourite scenes (and lines) in the film is when they receive a transmission of the Nuremburg rally as proof that they have made 'contact'. Someone asks: ""What are they trying to say?""; one person offers that maybe it's just their way of saying ""Hello"", ""Or seig heil, you're our kind of people..."" inserts Woods' dour army general. Priceless.The script also does a good job of making science seem pretty interesting, for those of us who've never looked at it that way before (like me) The reaction of the general population when they hear about the news is a nice touch (Foster riding into a carnival-like atmosphere with speakers blaring out ""Purple people eater""), as are the cameos by various people, including ex Prez Bill Clinton. OK, they're not crucial in terms of plot development, but they do help to maintain the previous treatment of the subject matter as something that could really happen. In opposition to this is a movie like ""Armageddon"", which, while fun and constantly hinting that it's scenario is possible, goes for the cheap thrills and one-liners rather than the cerebral route. (On a side note, I'm consistently amazed at how much of a bashing that movie takes from you venerable IMDb users, lighten up, guys!)What a shame, then, that all the hard work done in the first 2/3rds of the movie is almost undone by a contrived final third. Did the alien really have to take the form of her dead dad and spout off horribly sentimental platitudes? I could handle the vaguely moralising tone of the dialogue between young Ellie and her father at the beginning, because it seemed like a simple yet effective way of explaining why Ellie grew up to be such a forthright woman. Returning to the well again, however, is beyond the pale. It's an example of lazy scriptwriting to tie up any possible loose ends that I wouldn't have thought possible, given that otherwise the script is almost faultless. Hey, I LIKE loose ends sometimes, leave them alone!This pretty major gripe still isn't enough to prevent the film achieving a high mark on my ratings system, though. An impressively intelligent Hollywood treatment of a topical subject that should provoke reflection in its audience and stands up well to repeated viewings. Will deserve to be recognised as a modern classic 20 years after its release.",Contact
76,Screen_Blitz,"Contact challenges some thoughtful ideas, and the results are something deeply engrossing",8,16 November 2016,"What are the possibilities of extraterrestrial life existing on other planets? That's a question mankind has been trying to answer for thousands of years. While the media has managed to hit us with snub footage or photos of UFOs to show ambiguous evidence with aliens visiting Earth, no official confirmation has made leaving many of the public as well as scientists all over the globe skeptical. The idea of public's search for evidence of extraterrestrial life and the media's response to highly speculated phenomenon is greatly explored is this science-fiction drama (based on a novel by Carl Sagan) directed by Robert Zemeckis and based on a well-known innovator of visual storytelling in the cinematic world. Juggling though-provoking ideas, emotionally-packed storytelling, and innovation of visual effects; this film sees Robert Zemeckis pedaling one of his bravest ambitions yet. This film stars Jodie Foster as Ellie Arroway, an astronomer searching for evidence of possible extraterrestrial life outside our planet, a speculation she's encountered since he was a little girl before her father (played by David Morse) passed away. Assisted by blind SETI scientist Kent Clark (played by William Fichtner), Ellie makes a great use of a powerful radio system when she suddenly hears bizarre noises from above the atmosphere indicating possible alien life. With the public including the National Security Adviser David Drumlin (played by Tom Skeritt) along with religious leaders and the government denying the validation of her research, Ellie must go far out of her away for prove everyone wrong.The biggest surprise Robert Zemeckis brings to the table other than a step from the typical alien invasion disaster clichés is adding something more thought-provoking to the genre and executing it in a way that will leave viewers filling their heads with questions. And it by many means, it is effective. Though some may argue that Zemeckis raises big concepts over storytelling, the style in which he crafts the story of Ellie trying to search for the truth about extraterrestrial life is enough for viewers to even considers this a valid flaw. The film journeys us through any emotionally touching adventure that explores a thoughtful idea that speculates how society (particularly the media) would react to the possible discovery of aliens existing on other planets. One of the main themes tackled throughout is the challenge between science and the belief in God, similarly how our country has challenged the issue between whether evolution or creationism is true. That is where Matthew McConaughey as the lover of Jodie Foster's character comes in as the religious philosopher who initially denies her ideas, but eventually becomes more worried about losing her than what the truth holds in her research. Though the plot doesn't go completely flawless, it sets out to be engaging and with the magic of the director's storytelling, it never feels ham-fisted. Aside from this, Robert Zemeckis also doesn't the story's emotional core nor an amazing use of visual effects for granted, he brings them to life and drives a story that really works.Contact is a thoughtful science-fiction drama that not boasts the amazing ambition of Robert Zemeckis' filmmaking, but strikes a thought-provoking core that will likely leave viewers with many discussions once the film reaches the end credits. And let's not forget the decent performances by Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey who give it their awe in their roles. All in all, the beauty of Zemeckis's filmmaking is too inspiring to ignore.",Contact
77,dunmore_ego,Buried within The Message from Vega  The Message from Sagan.,8,29 October 2005,"""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" needed updating. ""Contact"" is that update. Though it may never attain the lofty heights of commercialism that ""Close Encounters"" enjoyed, ""Contact"" is, in fact, a more intelligent vision of extra-terrestrial communication with our outer-spiral-arm planet.From science maven Carl Sagan's optimistic novel of the same name, the movie is based on the ideology of the Drake Equation (the speculative theory postulating multitudes of Life-harboring planets in this galaxy, given the sheer quantity of possibly habitable worlds), defined in the movie by the almost-too-cute syllogism: ""If we are alone in the Universe, it sure seems like an awful waste of space."" The Drake Equation is weighed against the Fermi Paradox, which argues that if there *are* alien civilizations, why haven't we detected them yet? This movie's plot  obviously - negates that paradox.Whereas ""Close Encounters""' method of alien contact played on the age-worn industrial-era concept of aliens physically visiting Earth, an infinitely more efficient manner is effected in ""Contact"" by means of radio waves. SETI astronomers, headed by Ellie Arroway (perfect-featured Jodie Foster in sensual, leonine mane), stumble upon distinctly intelligent radio signals originating near the star Vega. In decoding The Message, they are astonished to find it is not merely a rudimentary greeting, but rather a technologically-superior detailed schematic for a Machine, to transport US to THEM.Considering the economics of space travel  not referring to 'money', but expending 'energy'  The Message defines the most judicious method for establishing contact, whilst discerning whether a civilization is ready and/or worthy to step up to an interstellar level of commerce. The concept of ""aliens"" has matured in this film, from simple benign or malignant humanoids (treating Earth as the retarded child of the galaxy), to ambiguous ""intelligences"", regarding us as near-equals, in placing the ball in our court.This maturity is due in great part to the inexhaustible efforts of the late Dr. Sagan, whose quest to bestow a sense of cerebral wonder in a generation jaded by laser-wielding aliens and detestably non-scientific ""science fiction"" found a culminating point in this movie.With aliens being so apparently existent, there comes the inevitable contention of Religion vs. Science, and though Sagan clarifies his position in the novel, the movie must necessarily leave the issue ambiguous to appeal to its demographic of (real or imagined) ""christians""  the bulk of earth's popcorn-plucking populace. The film ultimately ""preaches to the converted"" on BOTH sides. No Atheist or Christian will be jumping their razor-wire fences on the grounds of this movie.As with all major-studio releases, the screen story tampers with the novel's finer details, slotting it squarely within motion picture dramatic parameters - most notably modifying the overweight evangelist of the book, Palmer Joss, to that of Hollywood man-toy, Mathew McConaughey, to give Ellie that seemingly necessary ""love-interest"". Thankfully, the broad strokes retain enough of Sagan's driving pursuit of knowledge, elevating it above mere whizbang alien-invasion fare.Yet we do not lack for effects  stunning, thought-provoking effects, rather than ""be-still-my-pants"" jaw-droppers. The challenging opening sequence sees a camera panning backwards through space away from earth, beyond the edge of the Milky Way, outracing a jumble of radio static, which gets progressively ""older"", the farther out we go (as indicated by familiar tunes, news snippets and cultural signpost sounds - i.e. the farther out in space you get, the farther back in time you hear; in essence, time-traveling backwards - faster than light, no less, if you are outpacing radio waves!). Herein lies the foreshadowing of the whole plot. For those unfamiliar with the physics concept that underlines this sequence, the movie will make no sense.The visualization of The Machine (that The Message instructed to build) was a marvel of utility and ""alien"" design, seamlessly integrated into the landscape of Cape Canaveral. Most impressive was the tragic sequence which destroyed the first Machine  so artfully contrived, with views from the scores of ""media"" cameras covering the event - that the viewer never thinks to question where the reality ends and the green-screen babble begins.Though technically not a ""special effect"", an astounding camera trick with a running girl in a mirror will have you scratching your head for weeks as to how it was concocted - for directorial *aficionados*, this sequence alone is worth the movie.One can only hope that viewers can delve through the flummery (which must necessarily blossom during the latter stages of the movie, as The Machine traverses worm-holes) to the REAL ""message"" from Sagan: that the questioning and scientific mind is infinitely more precious to our species and creates more impetus for launching Mankind to the stars than the stagnating minds of the pseudo-science shamsters, which includes fanatical Christian contingents.One of the best arguments against *religionistas*  played out in the movie by the ever-psycho Jake Busey - is that no scientist has yet strapped himself with explosives and taken innocent lives in his quest to force an opinionated Physics viewpoint on other people, whom he believes he will ""save"" by blowing them up The incomparably-reliable David Morse is Ellie's encouraging father, while William Fichtner poignantly plays a blind astronomer colleague. A stoic Tom Skerritt is simultaneously Ellie's supervisor and adversary, although thankfully is not painted as ""villainous"", even though cast as the obvious antagonist; an intelligent rendering, keeping his interests ""scientific"" rather than petty. Although he does prevaricate to score his Machine seat, he is noble enough to admit to Ellie, ""I wish we lived in a world which rewarded honesty like yours"", to which Ellie replies, ""I thought the world is what we make of it."" Carl Sagan died before production was completed on ""Contact"", making it one of his last gifts to a blinkered world. The film's dedication read simply: ""For Carl"". I wept. Without him, the Universe seems like an awful waste of space.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",Contact
78,frankde-jong,An SF movie without martians,7,20 April 2021,"""Contact"" starts with a beautiful scene in which the camera zooms out of the earth and while the camera is zooming out we hear sound fragments from further and further back in time. For light there is a relation between distance and time (lightyears away). I don't know if there is also something like ""soundyears"" (I guess not), but the opening is imaginative all the same.Signals like sound are not only playing a major part in the opening scene, but also during the rest of the film. The film is about signals that seem to originate from an advanced civilisation. A passionate scientist (Josie Foster) tries to come into contact with this civilisation.In this way ""Contact"" is an SF movie in which the foreign civilisation tries to communicate by way of signals and not by travelling in person. So no Martians here. This benefits the reality (in SF of course to be interpreted in relative terms) of the movie and also keeps the special effects within limits. Compliments for a director who in other films does not economize on special effects (for example ""Back to the future"", 1985).A weak point in the film is the number of side plots (too much). There are sideplots with respect too:religion versus science;
competition between scientists;
the reaction of the population on the extra terrestrial signals;

79,Spuzzlightyear,Mork Calling Orson..,8,22 March 2012,"Akthough it gets a wee bit mathematical and metaphysical for its own good at times, Contact is still pretty easy to follow and pretty gosh darned entertaining. Jodie Foster stars here as a astronomer convinced there's Someone Else Out There. When the voices she continues to look for finally do come through, everyone predictably goes batshit trying to figure out What Does It All Mean, the solution, and the final outcome is all quite interesting and fascinating to a somewhat-techni-geek like me. Jodie Foster does a good job in a demanding role, and she's got quite the cast of veteran actors to support her, including Matthew Mcconneaghey, James Woods and Tom Skerritt.

80,sharky_55,They should have sent a poet.,9,30 March 2016,"If Jodie Foster's performance of the intelligent, resourceful Ellie Arroway was praised it is because of the excellent groundwork that a younger Jena Malone has laid for the character. In the past, her convictions are not as strong and grounded, and her rational, scientific worldview was still forming, so as she rebuffs the priest and tries to look at it from a logical perspective, she is secretly sending out radio signals at night and hoping her late father will pick up. This is of course a matter of faith, and it is heartbreaking because I think she knows that there is no talking to the dead, but wants to attempt so anyway. And then natural curiosity gives way to the continual mapping of the sky, and her drive has lead her to be in the unique position to discover this alien signal. Contact taps into that deep-seated sense of wonder that many people feel when they look up at the stars in the sky. For Ellie it is not only a probability, but an eventuality that life has formed elsewhere in the vast, vast universe, and she believes that they too will have the same dreams she does, to reach out and communicate. Zemeckis has brought a universal sense of scale to the project in the same vein as Forrest Gump; with the wide flurry of media opinions and personalities exploding into discussion and speculation, and with the special effects, which do not overwhelm the narrative like in many science fiction stories, but complements it. If the effects are somewhat dated today, Zemeckis hides it well, both with a grandeur view from afar, and even closer up, as Ellie sits above the magnificent contraption, humming and whirring in anticipation. The big elephant in the room is religion, which is also where the main problem of the film stems from. Re-watching it now the clues seem obvious from afar; the pointed references in the dialogue to god, the demonic glare of the religious fanatics towards Ellie, McConaughey's introduction. The script seems to feel that a necessity of this grand discovery is to hang up a straw-man and attack Ellie's worldview. And it seems that this attack comes from a predominantly white American perspective, even as the panel states that 95% of the world believes in some sort of 'supreme being'. ""We don't know if they even believe in God"" is one of the first lines uttered by a senator, and clearly outlines how determined this movie is towards stripping Ellie her worldview and placing ambiguity towards the question of aliens.It's a forced, contrived aspect. Even as Carl Sagan believed that mystical interpretation were just a reflection of the universe's magnificence, his source novel needed no such coincidence to fall upon the climatic journey to Vega. The circumstances in which the aliens deliver this dream- like message to Ellie and then quickly whisk her back therefore becomes, unsubtly, like her own version of a religious experience with god - brief, unexplainable and without a shred of proof. It's such a painfully unnecessary tension to force onto her character, particularly after that final little clue with the static footage. This very detail betrays the intended message; that religion and science are just two different interpretations of the same miracles. But of course this is a world where a renowned Christian philosopher can stroll into top secret government meetings and be on international selection panels for perhaps the most important decision for the human race. The sentimental romance plot is not needed - in Contact's quest for understanding the universe beyond our tiny little planet, it has all the awe, humility and hope needed to captivate the next Ellie Arroway.",Contact
81,sharky_55,For Carl.,9,18 February 2018,"As a child Ellie Arroway believed that she would one day contact her father through the stars, and as an adult she's still striving for the same goal, only using logic, reason and evidence as her tools. Does that nine year old girl know that speaking into a HAM radio won't magically connect you to the dead? I think she does, but tries anyway, and that makes it all the more painful. Years later she is a world-renowned scientist, but rejects a prestigious position at Harvard to coordinate the SETI movement. Naive to some, blindly optimistic to others. Is Contact science-fiction, or just pure science? It was conceived by Carl Sagan, who wanted to produce his screenplay but published the story as a novel when no funding would bite. He would serve as a scientific adviser to Zemeckis, ensuring that much of the scientific terminology and concepts were grounded in reality. Ellie also wrests with the same question; even as an adult, even seeing the world through her intellect and logic, there is still a glimmer of hope for the supernatural, for the chance to speak to the dead. In the pivotal moment in the wormhole, Zemeckis inserts a subtle CGI effect that overlays Jena Malone's features onto Foster's to signal that she has reverted to a childlike state of wonder and amazement. Those daydreams have come true - there is intelligent life out there after all. One might argue that Foster doesn't even need the assistance of digital effects. She has a remarkable malleable face, and although she must have stopped throwing crying tantrums at a very young age, you can still see worry etched in as an adult. Faced with perhaps the most exciting scientific discovery in human history, her face whips up a storm of anxiety when she realises that all the higher ups in command are more concerned with petty details: war, politics, not upsetting the religious majority. And watch her body language even in the midst of a romance, always turned away and gazing up at the stars above rather than her partner. See the shimmer in her eyes when she talks about the possibility of life out there. Her pillow talk could be a textbook itself. For decades Robert Zemeckis blended mainstream, eye-popping appeal on the big screen with his more personal ambitions, and broke new digital ground with every directorial effort. There are sublime touches throughout the film that speak to Zemeckis' mastery of effects driven visuals, not as a mere crutch for staging spectacle, but as a way of personal expression. It is how people like Ellie see the world. The opening shot pulls back through the galaxy, jumbling years worth of radio transmission, static and then silence, a testament to the sheer size of complexity of the universe. That it then is captured as part of a young Ellie's eye speaks to her life-long pursuit of meaning and truth beyond our tiny little spot in the Milky Way galaxy. Zemeckis moves his camera with a matured sense of Spielbergian wonder, pulling back to reveal grandeur and shiny monuments to outer space but also to heed a warning to our growing obsession with technology and filtered interactions. The special effects have barely aged a day, because they are capturing the supernatural, so any concerns of realism are irrelevant anyway. Why should an alien wormhole transportation device look 'realistic' to the human eye, when it is like nothing we have ever encountered before? The aliens themselves are not gross tentacled creatures, but beings of intense light. Most sci-fi assumes the arrogant stance that humans are always aesthetically superior to extra terrestrials, but Contact knows to concede that there may be races out there far beyond our comprehension. Films like Contact humble us, reveal how little of the universe we truly occupy, and how much we still have to learn. The screenplay admits, without damning or condescension, that religion is often not so much a dogma as it is a way of understanding the incomprehensible. What seems like conflict is merely two parties looking at it from the perspective of what reassures them. They both share humanity's most powerful instinct of curiosity. Who are we? Why are we here? Contact urges them to work together, instead of dealing in prejudice. It hopes that we deal more kindly with one another, that we preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.",Contact
82,jhclues,"Foster Makes ""Contact""",10,25 June 2001,"All of the greatest work by the greatest scientists has been done while they were very young, when they were stupid enough to believe that two-plus-two-equals-five, and pursued it instead of listening to all of those who were much older and wiser who said Don't Waste Your Time. Einstein, it has been said, asked all of his important questions before the age of twenty-five, then spent the rest of his life working on them. `Contact,' directed by Robert Zemeckis, is the story of a young scientist, Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster), who like Einstein and all the greats before her, has been asking questions and seeking answers since she was very young. And now, as a member of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) team, she is able to pursue her obsession with the mysteries of the galaxies and the infinite universe that surrounds us.  Her job is to sweep the skies, using the most sophisticated equipment available, for a signal from deepest space.  It may be her job, but for Ellie it's a labor of love, for she is convinced that there is something, or someone, out there somewhere, because otherwise, she reasons, what a terrible waste of space it would be.  Ellie may be a dreamer, but she knows in her heart that it is the dreamers who over the years have been responsible for making us evolve, making us learn and grow because they are the ones who take insane, foolish ideas and pursue them.  And to her, two-plus-two will always be five.	Ellie loves her job and believes in what she is doing, but it's been a struggle over the years, as she and others have had to constantly fight for the funding necessary to keep the project alive, begging for dollars from short-sighted, unimaginative people with vision that goes only as far as the bottom line of their budget book.  It's been a tough row to hoe, and she's had to swallow a lot of pride over the years, but then one day it all pays off, when in one magic moment she hears what she's been waiting for all her life:  A signal from a distant end of the galaxy-- someone attempting to communicate, to make contact, with the people of the Earth. 
	Ellie and her team soon realize that, whomever it is, they are using the universal language of prime numbers in their attempts at making contact; and when Ellie deciphers the code, she discovers something monumental in the bargain.  But it's a message of global importance, something much bigger than she and her team alone, and she soon find herself fighting to remain a part of the drama that is only beginning to unfold-- the first interaction between human beings and an alien life form.  And it's only the beginning of the adventure and the wondrous places this film is about to take you.	Jodie Foster gives a performance here that demonstrates what a gifted, talented actor she is.  Her Ellie is convincing and believable, and someone to whom you can genuinely relate, no matter who you are or where you're from, because there is something universal in Ellie's passion and longing to discover the truth and to see beyond the veil of our limited mortal capacities.  There's a strength to Ellie, born of a combination of intelligence and innocence, as well as tenacity and faith, and Foster manifests all of these complexities of her character beautifully, with a performance that should've landed her an Oscar nomination.  In this role, she is simply as good as it gets.	As the young Ellie, Jenna Malone gives a terrific performance, also, which certainly captures the same spirit that we find in the adult Ellie.  And there's a maturity she brings to the character that far exceeds her years. She was a perfect choice for the part, and if this is any indication of what she is capable of, Malone has a successful career ahead of her.	The supporting cast includes David Morse (Ted Arroway), Matthew McConaughey (Palmer), Geoffrey Blake (Fisher), William Fichtner (Kent), Tom Skerritt (David), James Woods (Kitz) and Angela Bassett (Rachel).  Zemeckis did a brilliant job of bringing this film to fruition, especially in the way he allowed Foster the time to really develop her character, by giving her that extra moment at just the right time that ultimately meant so much in the final analysis.  Too often it's those few minutes that wind up on the cutting room floor that make the difference between  a good film and an exceptional one; and between Zemeckis and Foster, they took it to the edge by taking some chances to realize that combined vision, which in the end made this a great film.  Thoroughly engrossing and entertaining, `Contact' will transport you to places you can only imagine, and it's all done with style and in a way that makes this a truly memorable cinematic journey. It's what the magic of the movies is all about.  I rate this one 10/10.",Contact
83,johno-21,Good intelligent sci-fi from the modern age of sci-fi films,8,21 April 2006,"I've only seen this film a couple of times and have never seen it on the big screen which would surely do it justice but it is interesting that despite it's big budget and huge cast of special, visual and sound effects personnel it isn't really a big special effects type film. It least it doesn't depend on the special effects to carry the story. There is a story here. Based on the novel by Carl Sagan who consulted on the film up until the time of his death, this screenplay is wonderfully drafted by James V. Hart and Michael Goldberg. Jodie Foster is a radio astronomer who learned to love the mystery of space through the hope and wonderment that she shared with her father in listening to ham radio when she was a little girl. In her research she makes contact with intelligent life from the far reaches of space that give her coded instructions on how to build a device to traverse time and space to visit their world. A project so expensive that only a government or someone extremely wealthy from the private sector could fund. Joining Foster in the cast are Tom Skerrit, Matthew McConaughey, James Woods, John Hurt, Angela Basset and Rob Lowe. Robert Zemeckis who has had a diverse and successful career with such films as the Back to the Future series, Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Romancing the Stone and the Polar Express directs. Zemeckis certainly knows how to handle a big budget production and gets the most from his producers dollars. Several veterans of Zemeckis films including cinematographer's Don Burgess and Editor Arthur Schmidt are on board this project. There is a lot going on in this movie and the weaving of footage of real life characters throughout this film takes away from some of the story itself but this is a good sci-fi film and I would give it an 8.5 out of 10.",Contact

OK, guess it does happen in real life, but the whole thing is quite jarring, and it certainly undercuts the ""holy man's"" role as a spokesman for the religious later. The theme of this movie is, pardon the pun, alienation.  Foster's character has let no one get really close to her since the sudden death of her father.  Losing both her mother and father in childhood makes her fear caring too much, or really believing in anything. Yet Foster WANTS to believe.  She risks losing her reputation in order to seek contact with an alien civilization.  Does she succeed?SPOILERS AHEADOf course; but this disappointing movie tries to have it BOTH ways.

88,The_Movie_Cat,"""A waste of space.""",4,23 January 2001,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS2001 had Strauss. Contact opens with CGIed planets set to snatches of Elvis and The Spice Girls. It all blurs past the screen without subtlety, dragging us into a nauseating prologue.This gives us Jodie Foster as a young girl, wanting to explore the universe because her dad let her use his CB radio. All of a sudden it segues into gut-wrenchingly-sentimental dialogue about her mother. ""Dad... can we talk to mom?"" ""I don't think even the biggest radio could reach that far"" replies her dad as the audience grabs a sick bucket. ""Hey dad... do you think there's people on other planets?"" she then offers. This is indicative of the contrived nature of the script. And what kind of responsible father would let his daughter talk to truck drivers anyway?When we meet Foster as an adult she's the young go-getter striving against the system (Cliché #4582200), working under a weary, less intelligent but scornful boss (Cliché #83475971). Her colleagues are a token black man, a token disabled man and the good-looking lead that she shags within the first twenty minutes. The dirty stop-out. In perhaps the only inspired character twist, she walks out on HIM with a ""I'll call you"".Tom Skerritt soon pulls the plug on her alien research  well, he would, wouldn't he? Look what happened the last time that he met an alien. But being a living plot device is hard on anyone, and he avoids being in too many scenes. Foster then enters a discussion with a research board for alternate funding. Why is it in films boards never say ""Fair enough, we'll give you the cash"" and have done with it? Instead Foster gets rejected then loses it, slagging off the review panel. Impressed by her spunk they then give her the money  and that's cliché #471781256.Pretty soon she's hooked up with James Spader and a token surfer dude who always seem to frequent scientific research departments for some reason. James Wood pops his head round the corner playing the only character he ever plays. In fact, the film is quite name-heavy, with Angela Bassett squandered as a Whitehouse representative. When the aliens send down a transmission of Hitler, the logical Hollywood choice for someone to seethe in indignant rage is a black woman. In fact it's a wonder they didn't throw in Jackie Gleason as well.The biggest star name though is my favourite US President, randy old Bill Clinton in a brief acting role. This is an amazing feat and a commendable one. Imagine how much more realistic Superman II would have been if Reagan had played himself in that.The alien transmission is relayed via news broadcasts from all over the world, including  yes!  a plummy English newscaster (Cliché #17537256). We then see how different cultures  hippies, native Americans, religious extremists  deal with the situation. Yeah, chuck another cliché on the pile.Things improve for the second half, where Foster is in a quest to meet the Vegans. That's the aliens, by the way, not people that refuse to drink milk. Pretty soon she's in a ship, strapped up with a head mike like a telephone receptionist. Her craft is remarkable for two reasons.

90,FloatingOpera7,Films Of The 90's: Contact,10,5 June 2006,"Contact (1997): Starring Jodie Foster, Matthew McConaughey, James Woods, Angela Bassett, John Hurt, Rob Lowe, David Morse, Geoffrey Blake, William Fichtner, Sami Chester, Timothy McNeil, Tom Skerrit, Thomas Garner, Larry King, Max Martini, Dan Gifford, Michael Chaban, Vance Valencia, Donna J. Kelly, Leon Harris, Claire Shipman, Jay Leno, Natalie Allen, Jake Busey, Kathleen Kennedy, Jill Dougherty. Director Robert Zemeckis, Screenplay James V. Hart And Michael Goldenberg, Based On The Novel By Carl Sagan And Ann Druyan.""You are an interesting species. You are capable of such beautiful dreams and such terrible nightmares""..........""Contact"" was a powerful film in 1997 that sadly, did not get enough Oscar attention, despite its genuinely brilliant acting by the entire cast, a great screenplay, thought-provoking, emotionally moving themes and stunning cinematography. The film is based on the Carl Sagan novel. Sagan died during the filming of the movie and did not live to complete the novel. Writer Ann Druyan who knew Carl Sagan personally finished the novel. Jodie Foster is delivering an Oscar-caliber performance in the role of Dr. Eleanor ""Ellie"" Arroway, the daughter of scientist and astronomer Ted Arroway (David Morse)who dies while Ellie is still young. Ellie receives signals from the distant star system of Vega, and is convinced there is alien life in the universe and furthermore is attempting to contact humans on earth. S.E.T.I. gets a hold of the same signals and relay the information to the U.S. government (this is the time of Bill Clinton's 2nd term as President). Clinton and world leaders and in fact the entire civilized world pay close attention as the signals are revealed to be blueprints for a transport machine. One special human being has to board the transport and make contact with the aliens. Matthew McConaughey portrays Palmer Joss, Ellie's love interest. McConaughey and Foster have interesting chemistry, though never at the mainstream Hollywood romance level and instead being a relationship in which, despite her purely scientific views and his more Christian science views, they respect one another as scientists and are bonded by their similar careers. Several cameos, including Larry King, Jay Leno, Angela Basset, John Hurt and Rob Lowe. There are several layers and themes to this poignant film. It is a chiefly agnostic film, as there are'not any absolute truths disclosed at the end of the film. Ellie experiences something powerful in the transport, but it's unclear whether she left the earth's atmosphere and traveled through outer space to other worlds, only to end up talking to her deceased father in a virtual island. The cameras surveying her mission reveal the engine fell into the water as a result of a malfunction and Ellie fainted and did not awaken until 18 hours later, raising the possibility she had hallucinated the whole experience. It looks at the nature of belief itself; belief in science, belief in alien life forms in the universe, belief in God, and the meaning of life in general. Ellie believes that the universe is too vast and full of solar systems which may contain life, believing that if there is only Earth it's as big waste. While we will never know the answers, Ellie tells a group of children on a school trip to an Observatory that the most important thing is to believe what one feels is his or her own truth. The special effects are absolutely amazing, especially in the scene where Ellie may or may not be traveling light years outside of the Earth. It even resembles ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and in fact ""Contact"" takes its place along with that masterpiece of sci-fi cinema as equally powerful. Anyone who is interested in films with a human touch to science fiction, in which neither an atheistic or religious viewpoint is extoled, and instead focuses on the nature of belief itself and the journey of one smart, strong girl into space, or possibly into her own soul, is welcome to see this film. Jodie Foster is delivering one heck of a performance. She is vulnerable yet strong, wide-eyed, intelligent, beautiful and should have won an Oscar. Also, through the various cavalcade of music and images, this film is a kind of capsule of human civilization and document of movies of the 1990's. Like Ellie's father or a possible alien says, humans are capable of beautiful dreams and such terrible nightmares. Humans are capable of progress and a lot of good, as well as destruction and evil. In this world there have been Hitlers and Mother Teresas, love, understanding, tolerance as well as hatred, war and corruption. This film is possibly one of the most reflective movies about the human condition and the longing to reach out to the unknown, a sentiment as old as time. Whether there is a God out there or not, we have each other and far more important than faith is love and the spirit of a tolerant and peace-loving humanity however different we may be from one another.",Contact
91,innocuous,Good movie of a very bad book.,2,13 October 2008,"To be fair, Sagan's 1997 book was astonishingly bad and this movie makes as much of it as one could. In later life, and perhaps under the influence of his wife, Sagan got...well, ""flaky"" is the only word that I can think of. (To be fair, aging politicians and actors do exactly the same thing.) I used to console myself that perhaps the book, ""Contact"", was simply one of Sagan's jokes. Perhaps, I thought, he set about writing a book which was the exact opposite of his own beliefs, especially those he discusses in ""The Demon-Haunted World"". Unfortunately, both the book and now the movie have persuaded me otherwise.What drives the characters in this move are some peculiar (and unsettling) types of motivation. For example, I, for one, can honestly say that I don't feel lonely and isolated from the universe because there aren't intelligent beings on other planets. In fact, I doubt very much that the knowledge of intelligent life existing elsewhere in the universe would help my loneliness (or any aspect of my life) one bit. I would find it interesting, but ultimately irrelevant to the meaning of life. Yes, this movie promises that one day there will be communications and travel between worlds that include Earth, but it also suggests that this won't happen until humankind is ready for it, which seems to be a bit after my life is likely to have ended.Sagan often wrote about claimed encounters with alien intelligent beings and was quick to point out that the aliens invariably delivered sermons on the need for peace, or reassurances about humankind's place in the universe. The ""little green men"" never give a human an indisputable piece of physical evidence, or impart knowledge (such as the proof for a theorem that has puzzled mathematicians for centuries) that might actually persuade others that contact has actually been made. In ""Contact"", Sagan does exactly what he preaches against. The protagonist ""meets"" with a representative of a far-advanced culture/species and is told a bunch of New-age pablum that is intended only to make her feel good. ""One day, your species will be ready."" Makes me want to barf.Finally, this movie is like the proverbial river that is half-a-mile wide and one inch deep. The characters are always spouting off about the ""meaning of life"" and conflicts between science and faith, but they have absolutely nothing to say about them and no new points of view to contribute. It's like using ""high-tech"" talk in a science-fiction movie without there being any real scientific underpinnings. Sure, people DO search for meaning in their lives. But there are many types of meaning (purpose, significance, worth, etc.) and they are not interchangeable. The dialogue here just tosses about a bunch of nonsense phrases and expects shallow-thinkers to be impressed.Overall, a very frustrating movie (and book). Just think how much better this would have been if Sagan had been in his prime (and if his wife had stayed out of it.)",Contact
92,movieguy1021,Contact: 5/10,5,3 September 2003,"Robert Zemeckis is one of the most versatile directors of our time. He's directed fantasy (Back to the Future), horror (What Lies Beneath), comedy (Who Framed Roger Rabbit), drama (Forrest Gump), and now science-fiction in Contact. It's quite obvious that Zemeckis is a Spielberg protégé, because, like Speilberg, Zemeckis has distinguishable features. While Spielberg has precocious children and endings that go on twenty minutes too long, Zemeckis has that Gump-ish music, precocious children, and endings that go on too long. What Zemeckis creates is very uneven: at one part it's exciting and unpredictable, and then the next it's as boring as watching snails race.Based on the best-selling book by Carl Sagan (to whom this movie is dedicated), Contact basically revolves around Ellie (Jodie Foster), who has dedicated her life to finding life out there (`If there's no one else out there, it seems like an awful waste of space'). She hears radio signals from the star Vega, and after long deductions, it turns out that they are blueprints to build a gigantic machine. Undeveloped characters and media buzz ensues.Possibly the best, and only remarkable part of Contact are the spectacular special effects. Zemeckis always directs great camera movements, and the opening few minutes really show that. Not only does it move with great grace, but also it's amazing to look at. It's breathtaking. The only other technically supreme scene was at the end, but I don't wish to give anything else away. While those two scenes excel in their technology, the rest of the movie isn't as marvelous. Although Zemeckis could have gone the easy way out and made it just eye candy (which would have made the movie a lot more interesting), he decided to throw in one-dimensional characters here and there (I didn't even know that a character was blind until I read about it online) and throw in a weak romance between Ellie and Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey). I don't really see how Ellie could go from rejecting Palmer to making out with him a few scenes later (it seems like a few scenes were taken out here and there to make the runtime shorter). It's not to say that most of the middle is boring, it's just not exciting. Also, was I supposed to have an epiphany or something? I see how this could convince an atheist, but I already believe in God, and the whole `spirituality' thing, although it adds to the characters, seems unnecessary.Jodie Foster, due to the birth of her baby, hasn't been in that many movies, so she must choose the ones that she can act the best in, and it seems like she does. Although most of her scenes involve yelling at someone, she conveyed the right amount of both skepticism and firmness. McConaughey is wasted, as is James Woods and Tom Skerritt. However, David Morse, as Ellie's father in flashback scenes, does an amazingly good job, conveying everything that I know David Morse to not be.If Hollywood produced more movies like Contact, then our movie supply would be better. However, if they were all exactly like it, then it would be no more than the onslaught of mediocre movies we've been having recently.My rating: 5/10Rated PG for some intense action, mild language and a scene of sensuality.",Contact

The argument of science vs. religion, or whether the two were compatible or mutually exclusive, was crucial to the book, and Palmer Joss was not only a three-dimensional character, he also had a clear point of view.  In the movie, however, his religious beliefs are just a generalized mishmash, and the movie suffers because of it.Still, this movie is quite powerful.  Jodie Foster shows why she was perfect casting as Ellie Arroway, using not only her intelligence, but her innner strength and vulnerability to play the character, and they all fit.  If the religion suffers, the science is well done without being too technical, and the filmmakers capture the wonder of it all without entering ""gee-whiz"" territory.

If we remove Sagan's masterpiece we are left with dumb sentimental dialogues, fluff about God (an insult, since Carl was a famous atheist), pathetic erotic interaction between Foster and McConaughey and the usual American nationalism. Thankfully Carl was gone before seeing it on the big screen, he was probably going to punch Zemeckis.

In Foster's Ellie, we see all the failed college relationships described in Carl Sagan's novel.After the death of her father (David Morse), Ellie becomes a star-gazer, convinced there can be no God. It's a simple, convincing, and rather moving set up, always propelling the story, even when the big themes rear their head. In, say, Spielberg's hands, this emotional core might have become cloying. But director Robert Zemeckis and screenwriters James V Hart and Michael Goldenberg tell the story almost entirely from the point of view of a heroine who is essentially an innocent in a world of cynical agendas. So when Ellie takes her voyage, those downplayed final scenes feel true, not mawkish.There are subtleties here which enrich the experience. Ellie is eventually blessed with her opportunity by the benign, paternal Hadden (John Hurt), who - unlike her own father - is able to cheat death.

She became interested in the topic as a young girl, learning the passion from her father, Ted (David Morse). Unfortunately, her father died when she was 9, and she had carried a sense of guilt about his death, as she believed she took too long to get the pills for his heart condition when he collapsed.As a senior researcher, she works first at a federally-financed observatory in Puerto Rico, but the program is cut by her superior, David Drumin (Tom Skerritt), who believes it is a waste of time.

There are many themes explored in Contact; the destruction or re-enforcement of the higher being - God, if there is other life are they benign or malevolent, the religious undertones of faith and the search for truth. While the religious and scientific aspect do collide, they are neither condoned nor called irrelevant. Both hold relevant questions, while they don't have answer, they can't be discredited.Contact is surrounded in that mysterious unknown sense; very reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odessy. Both venture into the realm of intelligent life forms with unknown actions; are they here to help or bring our doom. While 2001 was more abstract and surreal, Contact hits hard with the science and religious side, yet still leaves room for interpretation; you are asked to make your decision.From the moment she appears on screen, Jodie Foster has that commanding presence. What makes this film believable is from Foster, you can see it in her eyes, delivering another strong performance. Matthew McConaughey brings one of his best performances as Palmer Joss, who can't relinquish his religious beliefs in search of higher beings.

109,kgprophet,Bill Clinton and the Aliens,5,10 August 2020,"This review contains a minor spoiler that only deals with Jodie Foster's character.I first saw this in the theater in 1997, and it was still the era of emerging CGI, with new advances in objects like airplanes and ships becoming believable. Another appeal was the subject matter, the arrival of alien contact from another intelligence. SETI was a program I was familiar for many years before this movie came out, as well as Carl Sagan, who wrote the book on which the movie was based. There are many scenes that take place at the VLA, the famous facility that has a large number of radar dishes on rails that can be spread out for miles in New Mexico. So the movie is based at a cool location, and works well with the story.A major selling point was the director Robert Zemekis, who had the clout to obtain a decent budget for a science fiction feature like this. He had already achieved his best received movie, Forrest Gump, as well as good returns for Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Zemekis also had the ambition in Forrest Gump to put his actor into actual historical footage. He made failed attempts to change what famous people said. I felt these technical stunts were only distracting from the story.Here in ""Contact"", Zemekis feels the need to include our characters in Bill Clinton's White House. We can tell the moviemakers used very selective sound bytes to make it seem the president at the time was talking about communications from beyond our solar system. Again, it feels more like a technical stunt as we sit through Clinton addressing the nation from the press room, with the movie audience knowing very well he wasn't talking about what was going on in this movie.So the unenjoyable aspect of this movie is the big bad mean old government getting involved in the communication. So they send in armed troops (really?). There is continued back stabbing and other government gobbledy goop (delivered by a crusty James Woods). And there are other scenes that strain reality. For instance once the big moment happens, hundreds of thousands of people head to the VLA (in the middle of nowhere in New Mexico) to celebrate. Really? Why the VLA? The signal was sent to everywhere on Earth, meaning other observatories (with the right equipment) could pick up on the signal as well. And the fact about the signal originating from Vega, I doubt would prompt Vega car collectors to want to visit the aliens. The entire scene, as Jodie Foster drives through the crowd, is supposed to be lighthearted I guess, with a montage of silly responses (Elvis!) by the massive crowd.Another WHO CARES is Jodie Foster giving testimony in some Washington D.C. hearing room about her religious beliefs. Yes another impediment to the main story that we are more interested in. The book and the movie feel the need to address the religious aspects about this proof of aliens. We never get fully involved with the main story until all those obstacles are overcome and we get on with the big special effects and ""The Machine"". Instructions are sent by the aliens to build a worm hole machine in order to send a live human to their planet. This all is delayed until the third act, and then the movie becomes captivating.**MINOR SPOILER AHEAD***Jodie Foster, had recently played an ambitious career woman in ""Silence of the Lambs"". Her father, a big influence on her life, died when she was in her teens. Here she plays an ambitious career woman whose father, a big influence on her life, died when she was in her teens. Consequently, there are similar flashback scenes in ""Contact"" that weigh heavy on her adult mind. Her father dying is an important scene, but once again, Zemekis gets in the way by playing technical tricks with the cinematography, which only distracts and is not necessary.**MINOR SPOILER FINISHED**There has been some controversy about the ending. Some people doubt that would be the way aliens would contact us. Some ridicule the movie for turning the story back on itself at the end. I didn't mind the ending so much, because the movie was more about the adventure getting there than the actual moment of meet and greet. Spielberg had a hell of a time trying to depict a hypothetical meeting in ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".

It was a completely different twist on the ""is there life in outer space"" theme and was very well presented. With a number one supporting cast, including Tom Skerrit, James Woods, Matthew McConaughay and John Hurt, it has to be good. I enjoyed this feature more than ""Independence Day,"" ""Armageddon"" or ""Deep Impact"" all of which I deem to be excellent films. Is there intelligent life in outer space? Who knows. If there is why would they ever wish to contact us? The scope of the film is magnificent and it also addresses the philosophical and religious questions that must be asked if discoveries of this kind were ever come to light.

111,evening1,Bloated and incomprehensible,3,12 June 2020,"I always dislike it when I have to go to Wikipedia to read the plot of a film so I can make sense of what I'm seeing.I did that early on with ""Contact,"" a supercilious tale about brilliant scientist Ellie (Jodie Foster) and her quest to ""listen for"" life beyond Earth. Once she finds it -- in the form of a 1930's broadcast of Hitler that has been beamed back to Earth from a star called Vega -- the film gets way too complicated and bogged-down to care about. I bailed out of this turkey once Ellie lands on some space body -- can you land on a star? -- and meets a wraith, or something, of her long-departed father. And this was supposed to have come from the erudite mind of Carl Sagan?The movie is strongest at its beginning, where we meet the younger, beyond-precocious version of Ellie (Jena Malone) and her widowed dad (Tom Morse), who encourages her love of ham radio and the stars. Aside from older Ellie's time at a lab in the Puerto Rican rain forest, I found older Ellie to be annoyingly one-note and shrill. In a movie that is three hours long, way too much is asked of the audience, with far too little payback.I'll admit the movie has a few good lines in its first third. ""If it is just us, it seems like an awful waste of space,"" Dad tells younger Ellie. And how!""I think it's great that you listen,"" a colleague in PR tells older Ellie. ""Most people don't do that anymore.""I'll admit the film has a couple interesting things to say about paternalism, pessimism, and mathematics -- ""the only universal language."" There is also an amazing bit of film editing that seems to show Bill Clinton, president when this movie was released, commenting on Ellie's discovery.",Contact
112,disinterested_spectator,Religion and the Aliens,5,31 October 2017,"Long before the movie ""Contact"" was produced, I had known people who made some sort of connection between intelligent life on other planets and the existence of God. Maybe that is not quite right. It's hard to say exactly, because no one ever presented the connection as a valid argument, consisting of premises about extraterrestrial beings and ending with the conclusion that God exists. No such argument was ever forthcoming, because it would have been palpably absurd on its face, even to them. Instead, they just seemed to feel that the existence of aliens had religious significance, but they could never quite to bring themselves to spell it out.Apparently, it was people just like that who made ""Contact."" The movie is mainly about making contact with extraterrestrials through the transmission of signals through space, but religious stuff keeps showing up, not because there is any logical connection between the two, but simply because some people seem to feel that connection, even though that feeling never seems to rise to the level of coherent thought. Mostly what we get is the association of ideas.For example, Jodie Foster plays Dr. Ellie Arroway, an astronomer. When Ellie was a young girl, she had a ham radio. At one point, she asks her father if she can contact her deceased mother through her radio. And after her father dies, she tries to contact him through her radio. So an association is made between radio transmissions and life after death. We regard this as merely a child's desperate hope of finding her parents again, which would be just fine as a stand-alone scene. But further such childlike associations recur throughout the movie.While listening for signals from outer space in Puerto Rico, she meets Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), who is an almost-priest whose spirituality expresses itself as a concern for human values that he believes are being jeopardized by technology. Ellie and Palmer have sex, and in the afterglow, during a little pillow talk, he says: ""So I was lying there, just looking at the sky. And then I felt something. I don't know. All I know is that I wasn't alone. For the first time in my life, I wasn't scared of nothing, not even dying. It was God.""There it is in a nutshell: He looks up at the sky; he has a feeling of the sublime; so there must be a God.By this time in her life, Ellie has become an atheist. She says, ""And there's no chance that you had this experience because some part of you needed to have it?""As a way of forestalling such rational objections, Palmer says, ""I'm a reasonably intelligent guy, but this. My intellect couldn't even touch this.""And that's the end of that. His epiphany transcended such things as reason and common sense, so it cannot be questioned.Ellie and Palmer get into a debate about the existence of God. She appeals to the principle of Occam's razor: ""Occam's Razor is a basic scientific principle which says: Things being equal, the simplest explanation tends to be right. So what's more likely? An all-powerful God created the universe, then decided not to give any proof of his existence? Or that he doesn't exist at all, and that we created him so we wouldn't feel so small and alone.""Palmer says he would not want to live in a world where God does not exist. Ellie, in turn, says she would need proof. Palmer asks her if she can prove that her father loved her. She is stumped.Anyway, Ellie gets to visit the aliens. She zips through a wormhole and ends up in a world based on what is in her mind, memories of a beach in Pensacola and of her father. The alien who has taken on the image of her father explains everything to her, how lots of civilizations from different planets have interacted this way. Ellie wants to know why more people from Earth can't see what she's seen. The alien answers, ""This is the way it's been done for billions of years."" Sound familiar? Just as we are not supposed to question the ways of God, we are not supposed to question the ways of the aliens.When Ellie gets back, a lot people don't believe her story about what happened. In particular, Michael Kitz (James Woods), who is sort of the villain of the piece, calls her story into question. He says she just hallucinated it, that the whole thing is a hoax. He demands that Ellie produce proof, and she cannot. He indignantly asks if we are supposed to accept her story on faith.Now Ellie is in the position of someone who believes in God but cannot prove it. And now we know why the aliens demanded that just one person go on that trip to Vega instead of the Vegans coming to Earth. In that case, everyone would have seen the aliens on television. There would have been no doubt as to their existence. But this way, the aliens recapitulate the objection that Ellie had earlier, that God did not leave proof of his existence. So all the objections earlier enunciated by Ellie about God are turned against her with respect to the aliens. Ellie's response to these objections harks back to the mystical experience Palmer had while stargazing, almost a beatific vision.For those of you who are inclined to infuse the existence aliens from other planets with religious significance, this movie is for you. For those of you who have no need of religion, this movie will make you feel like an alien from another planet",Contact

114,Dockelektro,Contact with something never seen,10,10 August 2001,"In my country we call a movie like this a ""esgalha"". This word doesn't have any translation to english, it's just portuguese lingo which means something between ""well-achieved"" and ""fantastic"" and ""truly great"" but it's the only word I can find to express my feelings when watching a movie like this. From the first time I saw the trailer, I knew this one would be something great. I had been a fan of Bob Zemeckis, and I didn't think he ever failed to achieve his intentions in a project: among his all-time best are the escapist genius of ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", the incredible ""Back to the Future"" saga, and even one of his first movies, ""I Wanna Hold Your Hand"", a chronicle of Beatlemania which was broadcasted more than 10 years ago here and I never heard of again. This movie was his great comeback. But he wasn't the only one: along for the ride was one of my favorite actresses, and she was coming to a much-wanted return, needless to say, after all those years of pause.I shall say that, if this movie didn't brought me to tears, it was because it wasn't long enough. It stroke me right on the face: before seeing it I just saw a trailer, I didn't know any plot details, I didn't know any good moments, absolutely nothing. So when I come across that opening scene, just that chilling experience told me that this one was going to be good. And it didn't fail to be so: it's, from my point of view, one of the best movies of 1997, no questions asked. Using a credible source (the book from Carl Sagan), fantastic actors (Foster deserved an oscar nomination, as well as John Hurt as Hadden) and a surrounding feeling which makes us grab the arms of the chair (my heart was beating in the the final sequence), I rarely seen a movie with such a gift to have our hearts beating according to its own pace. The scenes are surprising from the beginning to the end, and it has a kind of poignancy which is rare these days. I will not spoil any plot, I don't want to make you lose all the suprises of a good film, just see it. I just admire, and will keep on loving it. It's a part of my DVD collection the moment it's out of the stores. See it in the theatres if there is a chance, or with a really good sound system and a big screen. It is worth it.",Contact

While this is Jodie's movie, John Hurt as Hadden is excellent. The story is actually rather simple, but filled with great ideas, as you would expect from Sagan. The only element which drags is the Matthew McConaughey character. I am uncertain why, but it did not work. Apart from that this movie is a classic which you will find yourself re-watching, if for no other reason than to hear John Hurt say from space, do you want a ride. The scene when Jodie enters the capsule is breathtaking. Make sure you watch this before you die otherwise you will kick yourself silly in the afterlife.",Contact
116,eshwarmail,Would have worked more as a TV series since it had a lot to tell even with the bloated runtime,7,13 October 2012,"An interesting but uneven psychological science fiction that deals with different perspectives on existence of life outside Earth as well as what will be the reaction if a contact actually happens. Only problem is that it takes itself too seriously and tries too long to present a justification for everything that happens in the movie.Eleanor (Jodie Foster) has been fascinated about long distance communication and life outside earth from a very young age partly influenced by her father (David Morse). She focuses her studies and career towards this and chances on a communication from an unknown source. This communication after a lot of research is understood to be a design for building a spaceship to reach them.Jodie Foster as usual gives her best, but what sets the tone in the movie is Jena Malone's innocent passion which makes us understand what the older Eleanor does what she does. The intermittent politics, romance, science fiction - all take up a lot of runtime leaving too many things to conclude hastily. It could have worked a lot better as a mini-series like Taken or Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. I have admired a lot of Robert Zemeckis films where most of them has a naughty child-like passion and an intelligent main plot to them.

Without the religious/faith elements, it would have been one of the few pure science fiction films Hollywood has released in the past 50 years.  As it is, I like the way the script combines and synthesizes the elements of sci-fi and religion, making each seem more meaningful than it would be by itself -- a fitting tribute to Carl Sagan. It's hard to imagine this film as pure science fiction, but I don't think it would be nearly as entertaining and thought provoking if it were.** Some spoilers **The element of wonder and surprise is, for me, what really made this film. The moment when 'Ellie' walks across the bridge to the spacecraft is one of the most awe inspiring moments in film history -- think of it, risking one's life in an unknown device built for unknown reasons and it will do who knows what?  It's an incredible moment of suspense and wonder.The film gets weaker in the last half hour, after 'Ellie' arrives at her destination.  In retrospect, one can only think that more could have been done with the story, and that what was done could have been done better. However, it doesn't detract too seriously from the film as a whole.  The last few minutes of the film (after the congressional hearing) reveals a 'secret' that vindicates the film, and apparently some other reviewers missed it -- pay careful attention near the film's conclusion, when the presidential advisor is talking by teleconference to the national security guy.  What she says (about the recording made on board the spacecraft) is crucial to the plot, and if you miss it then you miss everything.Overall, this film does an outstanding job at both entertaining and provoking thought -- it's compulsively watchable and rewatchable, and one of the best films of the 1990's.  9/10.",Contact
121,dimplet,Spiritual science fiction,8,18 July 2011,"Great opening sequence! Too bad a lot of viewers don't have a clue what's going on. See, radio waves travel at the speed of light, 186,000 miles per second or 5,878,625,373,183 miles in a year (or 9,460,730,472,580 km,) i.e., 1 light year. So if you could instantly travel 50 light years from Earth you could, theoretically, pick up radio waves that were transmitted 50 years before. And electromagnetic radio waves also are used to transmit television, which we hear but don't see as the image moves farther from Earth. That's why we hear President Franklin Delano Roosevelt give his famous Pearl Harbor speech and why we hear Hitler. This is the image of humanity the Earth is sending out into space, and it's not a pretty picture that any alien civilizations might and could hear. But conversely, we should be able to pick up radio waves from other planets, too, with a strong enough antenna. That's what the movie is about.That's the basic science. But many viewers probably are clueless when it comes to the technological time line of the 20th century; this includes young Americans, but is especially true of viewers outside the West. Electronic television was first demonstrated in 1927 by Philo Farnsworth, but was delayed in America by patent lawsuits by RCA. So Germany in 1936 and England in 1937 were the first to begin regular broadcasting. The U.S. had only experimental stations until 1939, but WWII then froze TV station construction until 1948. Some Asian countries didn't get television until the 1960s or 70s. What you hear in the opening is primarily American broadcasting (hey, this is an American movie), until the shocker: Hitler. Germany used primarily American and British technology to try to claim Nazi superiority by being the first to broadcast television live, sort of. Their television cameras were not sensitive enough, so they filmed events, ran the film through a very fast developer in a truck and then scanned the film for broadcast of Olympic events. You can see some of this film of Nazi TV footage on Youtube! Meanwhile, mein Fuhrer starts showing up on astronomers' television sets on Vega 27 years later, and they send a message back to Earth, which is received after another 27 years. Get it? And 40 years later, those Vegans start developing an irresistible craving for Big Macs. Great opening. Now the film changes gears, and we see the birth of a young radio astronomer as a ham radio operator, metaphorically. But after that we get a lot of philosophizing. Some people seem to consider philosophizing ""propaganda,"" but we are seeing a variety of viewpoints espoused. This is in the grand old tradition of science fiction going back to Robert Heinlein, where the story is not about technology so much as speculation about the spiritual potential of human beings. Oddly, the religious mouthpieces in the movie don't seem to get this; spirituality for them is a theological hierarchy with God at the top. But science, and here the contact with an alien species, is about potential for human progress, which is ultimately spiritual progress and understanding. The movie could have made this clearer, but Ellie gets tongue tied in her testimony. The truth is, no one can really imagine what contact would mean.Instead, we witness this through Ellie in her travels through the worm hole and her vision of swirling galaxies, when she is at a loss for words to describe what she is seeing. We get a small taste of the enormity of the universe. And when she returns to Earth we see how puny human squabbling is in comparison, and how far our species must yet travel to reach our potential as human beings. That is the key vision ""Contact"" seeks to convey. Why, if there are so many solar systems and galaxies, have we not yet made contact? For one, more advanced civilizations may have long abandoned radio wave communication for some other medium unknown to us. More likely, they are waiting to see if we self-destruct. They don't need a Gort and Klaatu to threaten Earth if we don't behave; they probably realize planets have a self-destruct mechanism to test global cooperation we know as global warming. (Or maybe they are waiting for us to self-destruct so they can colonize the beautiful Earth.) The aliens aren't talking because it is up to us to solve our own problems without outside help, which would be a form of galactic cheating. If we're still around in 100 or 1,000 years, then we'll talk. When that time comes, what will it be like?On the other hand, there are those who say we are already talking.",Contact
122,higherall7,The inner truth about Outer Space...,10,9 June 2021,"This is a fine movie about how alienation becomes enlightenment. Here the quest for a greater role and relationship with the physical universe itself results in a greater sense of what one can share with a universal community beyond the living and the so-called dead. You should be aware that when Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan get into the game it's on and here is a space adventure that does not disappoint. Lots of references to ideas from Buckminister Fuller's Dymaxion theology and John Hurt as the reclusive billionaire S. R. Hadden is the next best thing to Isaac Asimov's Hari Seldon. The contact between Jodie Foster as Doctor Eleanor 'Ellie' Ann Arroway and Matthew McConaughey as Palmer Joss gives a nice romantic underpinning to the ongoing debate about the relative merits of Science and Technology Versus Faith and Religion in the film.There has been some grousing about how characterization is given short shrift in lieu of the thundering and earth shattering concepts being explored here. But I've always thought of Science Fiction as being essentially Concept Storytelling at heart, designed to inspire awe and wonder at the skillful exploration of new ideas. Director Robert Zemeckis provides plenty of that here in this tale. But the individualistic and romantic angle chosen for dramatic purposes, instead of a focusing on the group dynamic of the intelligentsia, is pure Hollywood and simply the nature of the beast. A deeper probing and development of character is to be found in Sagan's novel, but once again, don't expect the hand and heart wringing of Dostoevsky. We are in the land of the Very Large Array here, folks, and from this point forward we will be collating the facts and crunching the numbers for an invite to and an audience with extraterrestrial intelligence.What we do get here is a thrilling ride through Kip Thorne's concepts of wormholes thanks to the exhaustive efforts of eight separate VFX companies, including Sony Pictures Imageworks, Peter Jackson's Weta Digital, and George Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic. The scenes of actual alien contact are as viscerally evocative and hair-raisingly momentous as anything recorded in Orson Welles' radio broadcast of THE WAR OF THE WORLDS (1938). But rather than being the climax of the film as in CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND (1977), we have only begun our slide down the rabbit hole. There is more to come, as these aliens have some serious preppin' and explaining to do. We discover, along with Arroway and crew through the language of alien origami, that if we want tickets, we have to come correct.When Doctor Arroway does finally have the chance to follow the yellow brick road thrown into her lap, she answers up with all the right stuff. Jodie Foster, whose character was based on the American astronomer Jill Tarter, cuts a mean figure in a space suit with winning dignity and sex appeal. Upon her arrival into alien territory, her new Cosmic neighbors find it best to communicate with her through the Earth trauma of her past impressions about her father and various other aboriginal pleasure moments. This is a telling point in the drama. Apparently communication with other worlds and species requires an extensive and ongoing qualification process involving evolution on physical, mental, and spiritual levels and is not particularly for those whose mental landscape is unduly rooted and anchored in the past. But the promise of the treasures of the stars are out there for those who can untether themselves from the past and embrace a new future.Anyway, despite its focus on the alienation of the main character and its illusory nature, this film can offer satisfactions to the soul and the heart as well as the intellect. Alex Silvestri's musical score is arresting, but not as fundamental a component or as memorable as the score for 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968). But rest assured this has little or nothing to do with cops and robbers or cowboys and indians in space. This cinema is a gentler exposition of true Science Fiction territory, whose primary intention is to break down the logical structures and systems of the mind in order to arrive at the freedom of new thought. The film rightly won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation and many Saturn Awards as well. There is elegance in the adroit handling of the issues of faith and knowledge that particularly bears the energy signature of Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan.",Contact

Though I thankfully haven't lost any sleep over it (I have 'Thumper' in the apartment above me to thank for that), as Led Zeppelin would say in the classic 'Stairway to Heaven', '...and it makes me wonder'.As what happens in most of these movies, it's rather anticlimactic once the different cultures meet. I'll say to my dying day that the most difficult thing to do in cinema is end a film. Here (unlike perfect sci-fi masterpieces, like '2001: A Space odyssey' or the more recent 'Children of Men') the decent but otherwise unspectacular ending makes me avoid a perfect rating here. But it's awfully close, worth both owning and rewatching, and provides fairly early evidence (which would come to bold fruition in 'Killer Joe') that Matthew McConaughey could actually act.

It stars Jodie Foster as a faithless scientist who learns a lot about herself and fellow man when she finds a ratio signal coming from the star Vega. The movie speculates that humans will have to communicate with other life forms via radio waves first, not by getting on the Spaceship Enterprise and zig-zag through the universe or coming across a crashed UFO. It's no surprise that a scientist wrote a story that contains the most likely scenario of first contact, and makes other science fiction movies look like science fantasy. The ending of the movie contains a powerful message of where science and religion can find middle ground, of course after the infamous ""non-alien alien"" scenes. I loved that scene. You don't have to have little green men to know that you are seeing something not from this world, but some people felt cheated by this outcome. I didn't.

When she will not accept on faith the ""truths"" imposed on her by religious zealots, she is denied the chance to be a part of a mission based on her research. Later, she is ridiculed for asking others to accept what she has seen with her own eyes.Purists among us will quibble over some of the film's science, particularly in an early scene where Dr. Arroway, a brilliant mathemetician, miscalculates the odds of finding advanced civilizations in the universe by orders of magnitude. But the film has many worthy diversions. Matthew McConaughey, as Palmer Joss, is supposedly the good guy among the religious right. He is cunning and calculating, and like most religious fanatics, he is willing to do anything to get his way, especially if it includes a chance to punish nonbelievers. But Rob Lowe is priceless as Richard Rank, a thinly veiled version of Ralph Reed, a bigoted, hateful power monger who wields his flock as a sword to further his political interests. Tom Skerritt's Dr. Drumlin lacks dimension, but is right on as the Machievellian politician exploiting Arroway's discovery. The supporting cast is sterling, including Angela Bassett, Jake Busey and David Morse, as Dr. Arroway's father. But the gem of the supporting cast is John Hurt. He is utterly magnificent as the ominous S. R. Hadden, the Howard Hughes-like scientist who lives on an airplane and funds the research that leads to the discovery of the alien signal.Trivia note: one of Dr. Arroway's colleagues is Dr. Kent Clark, and I can't help but wonder what Sagan implies by that, aside from the obvious. Far better than the typical Sci-Fi fare, Contact is a thoughtful and challenging look into the relationship between science and religion. It isn't hard, from watching the movie, to determine which side of the conflict Sagan came down on.",Contact
130,danielll_rs,Another score for Jodie Foster in a wonderful film,8,23 October 1999,"I am a fan of Jodie Foster since I saw ""The Silence of the Lambs"", where she shows one of the best performances by an actress ever. In ""Contact"" she proves one more time that she's just incredible. I can't understand why she wasn't nominated to the Oscar. Maybe because this film (that also deserved to be nominated) is very complex to the people in general- I am talking about the ones who liked ""Titanic"" (yuck!), ""Good Will Hunting"" (ugh!) and other dumb flicks.""Contact"" was one of the best films of 1997, a weak year for cinema, and it impressed me. The story is amazing, specially the last 30 or 40 minutes, which really kept my attention. This film, as another recent one - ""The Sixth Sense"" - is a thing to think about, and not just to watch and forget. Of course there are some moments when ""Contact"" fails, but the mistakes are very small and the film is great the same way.",Contact
131,Mickey Knox,The truth is within ourselves,8,17 April 2001,"Robert Zemeckis strikes again, with a beautifully done SF story, an impressive drama about the quest for truth, for revealing huge misteries and for the sacrifices we're willing to do to accomplish our dreams.Ellie Arroway is a talented scientist, who searched all her life the proof of the existence of extraterestrial life forms. She has to fight not only with the difficulty of her job but also with the funders, the ones that pay for her research and who think that she is wasting her time and her talent on something that cannot be proven. One day Ellie picks up an audio signal, who proves not to be from Earth, but from a star named Vega. From this point starts the quest for knowledge, an impressive tale that will keep you watching until the end, although its pretty long runtime (more than 2 1/2 hours).Jodie Foster is brilliant as Ellie, she manages a great performance, alongside Matthew Mc Connaghuey and an also surprisingly good Tom Skeritt.Zemeckis shows the whole story with an extra touch of feeling, and during the film you get connected with the characters, you get to care about them or you get to hate them. But there are no ""bad guys"", no character to totally hate. Each one has good points and does good deeds. But they also screw up from time to time.This film is very good so i recommend it to everyone - you won't feel sorry. Vote : 8.5 out of 10.",Contact

If the movie had kept to that central premise, it would have been more entertaining.But it gets bogged down with issues of religion and politics, and issues of Jodie Foster, the scientist and main character, relating to men in her life. A little bit of personal drama is necessary in science fiction, but in ""Contact"", the writers got carried away with it.  Jodie travels through space and time, to what, meet her father and reconcile childhood issues? C'mon, give me a break.

136,metalrage666,A 2 hour build up to nothing,1,21 June 2019,"I first saw this when it was in cinemas in 97 and as I recall, I hated it. I recently caught this again on TV 22 years later and unfortunately, not much has changed. I thought that maybe I would have a different opinion after all this time but all the feelings of negativity came flooding back to me, the annoying characters, the contradictions, the religion versus science talk and incredulity of all involved just reignited the dread I had for this movie through and through.Jodie Foster is working for SETI at the VLA in New Mexico and is trying to secure funding. A last ditch effort is successful due to an eccentric, reclusive billionaire industrialist. Fast forward 4 years and the program is again facing foreclosure as the president's science advisor considers the project a waste of money. At this time a signal is received from the Vega system and interest is renewed. The first signal is a series of prime numbers at regular intervals indicating that the signal is of intelligent origin. SETI consults with an observatory in Australia to confirm the authenticity of the signal and to continue recording. Naturally this upsets the U.S government as consulting with other agencies is a breach of ""national paranoid security"" (despite being allies), and the fact that the signal is meant for Earth and not a single nation is irrelevant so having heavily armed soldiers hanging around a civilian installation is supposed to do what exactly? Other than freak out already nervous civilian scientists, not much at all apparently.A second signal is then received, this time it's a recording of Hitler opening the Olympic Games in Berlin. The fact that this was the first recording strong enough to escape Earths atmosphere is lost on these idiots and the idea that the signal is potentially from alien Nazi sympathisers becomes the main focus.Embedded in the recording is thousands of pages of mathematical formulae and code. Annoyingly the U.S government is clearly not interested in sharing the information and as a result no one is able to decipher it with the exception of one eccentric, reclusive billionaire. In addition to the the code are schematics for building some kind of machine. Without knowing what it does or what it all means, the dumb government questions of ""what does it do"" and ""what does it all mean"" to scientists that haven't been given the opportunity to properly examine all the info or collaborate with international experts is irritating in the extreme.So without knowing what it does and despite the voices of impending doom and gloom about possible Trojan horses and doomsday weapons, the machine is built anyway to the tune of almost a trillion dollars. Unfortunately it's all for naught as the whole operation is brought undone by a single religious nutcase turned suicide terrorist. Really? At perhaps the most secure facility on Earth a well televised zealot manages to pretend that he works there, get past security with home made explosives strapped to himself, get all the way to the entry gantry and blow the whole thing to hell. Normally, that, they say, would be that, but wait, what's this! In addition to a free set of steak knives, there's another secret facility all built and ready to go in Hokkaido Japan, and no one seems to question this?So having one scientist talk to another in Australia is a breach of national security, but the building of a secret facility in the land of a former enemy, well that's OK as long as it suits our objective. So naturally Jodie Foster is the prime candidate to go, even though she was not eligible before given her lack of faith and we cannot have this atheist heathen as a representative of Earth, but it's alright now because, reasons!From Foster's perspective once the pod is released into the machine, she ends up hurtling through vortexes and worm holes reminiscent of Star Gate or 2001 and ends up either in an alternate reality or virtual world similar to a beach she frequented on Earth and is approached by an alien that takes on the form of her deceased father. In the end, despite all the effort that went in to making the trip possible from deciphering the messages, getting around inevitable endless government red tape, the cost and the logistics of bringing it all together, the underlying message is that this is only the first step, we are not ready to know any more than that and we are all supposed to get along if we're to join any kind of intergalactic community.From the perspective of observers, nothing happened and it was nothing but a big white elephant all perpetrated by none other than a reclusive eccentric billionaire. Foster's story is not believed, none of the recording devices worked and a senate committee is incredulous that they are supposed to take the story on faith, the very same thing they crucified her for not having earlier when they were first recruiting for test pilots.How on Earth this was nominated for any awards and how it actually won any is beyond me. I hated everything about this. I never understood why we bother with things like SETI or even the voyager space program as in the event we ever do come into contact with anything, our first response seems to blow it out of existence before they destroy America and who cares with the rest of the planet. From what I know of the book, there appeared to be more international involvement and collaboration, which for me would have made more sense and made the movie more interesting. The Hollywoodening of movies that insist on eliminating the existence of other people beyond the U.S borders is tiresome and outmoded even for 1997. The excessive use of real life personalities playing themselves might have been relevant at that time, but doesn't give the movie any longevity and just distracts from the story. I might see this for a third time in 2041, if I'm still alive by then and if I like it, I'll know senility has set in.",Contact

139,adrongardner,White Noise,4,4 January 2011,"Before I review this film, I am going to say this. If you haven't seen this film - don't. Track down Disney's 80s made-for-cable ""Flight of the Navigator"" and be happy with a bowl of popcorn on a Saturday night. But if you must... Contact is a difficult film to review. Based on Carl Sagan's serenade novel to the stars, the ambitious, and occasionally moving, story of Ellie Arroway taps into the romance of stargazing but fails to explore the larger implications of the Pandoras Box it opens. Like a black sheep family member, I really can't hate this film, but it is also so difficult to love it. In many ways Contact is a concept film - a ""what if"" statement on a slice of Kubrick's 2001: A Spacey Odyssey. ""What if"" somebody made an entire film on somebody discovering the monolith from 2001? ""What if"" the monolith and signal is a radio transmission telling us how to construct an advanced piece of technology? ""What if"" we ditch the stark soundtrack of deep breathing sounds and add pulsing radio transmissions, romance and a sad story of a little girl losing her dad? This is the movie Contact is. On paper, it all sounds so interesting, but somehow it all goes very wrong. Jodie Foster invests heavily in Ellie and so does the audience. She is stubborn, driven and also charismatic. What I am not persuaded by is the script's tacky father-daughter story laced so sloppily into the plot. What I feel, is there is a greater story to be mined here, but the father- daughter angle rings hollow. John Hurt is wasted as a Yoda inspired bald genius and every other character in the film seems recycled from One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest institution staff. There are too many villains and the only supporting character with more than one dimension is Matthew McConaughey. This is one of those movies where everybody is crazy and evil but Ellie. Everybody knows better than Ellie - they know so much better, they do everything she says and in the end, still make her think she is crazy. It is one of those movies where you are continually frustrated by the contrived characterizations and idiocy of the writing than engaging into the story. Yes it is one of those movies. The film is based largely on the idea and euphoria of discovery, but the film offers so little of it. Director Robert Zemeckis tries desperately to resolve questions about aliens and religion within the social conscious, but instead we are given long lectures, congressional testimonials and emotional schlock more fitting to the Young and the Restless. Like a bad episode to the TV series LOST, there are many exciting ideas in Contact but they end up flushed by filmmakers and writers who are afraid to take on these ideas, or even any of Carl Sagan's ingenuity or conjectures from the novel, with any seriousness or dedication. The filmmakers take the easy way out and play out melodrama instead of insight. The novel's intricate plot is ditched for a ""are you kidding me?"" laugh-out-loud ""alien"" beach rendezvous and intelligent writing is ditched in favor of teary-eyed soliloquy to tug at your heart strings. The search for intelligent life in movies continues. The finality doesn't do justice to Ellie Arroway any of the deep ideas proposed by the plot or ultimately to the intelligence of the audience. There is, however, one brief redemption. There is a moment in the film where Ellie is lying in the Plains of San Augustin under the VLA telescope listening to static. This is when the first pulse of the alien signal hits. Ellie's eyes grow large and so do ours. It is an incredible epoch. It is the only moment in the two and a half hour film where Contact actually makes some.",Contact

141,StevenKeys,Contact,8,5 July 2020,"What could've been a four-star film, instead devolves into a unexpected character reversal and placating of religious and secular viewer both (""We're not alone"") in a misguided attempt to please everyone but should please no one.For nearly its entirety (150m), Contact is a bold, engaging tale of interstellar messaging (Vega) with its protagonist, Dr. Ellie Arroway (Foster), giving one of filmdom's great speeches in her passion plea for ""just the slightest bit of vision"" from would-be sponsor, HR-Hadden, a John Hurt performance that should've nabbed him an Oscar (one nom: Best Sound). But in the final ten climactic minutes as Ellie testifies about her space trip in front of a hostile Senate which seems beset with a collective amnesia, forgetting the tsunami in science-bending advances that enabled construction of her machine, one riding on existitng Einsteinian theory (worm-holes), its ""10,000"" blueprints no Earthling, not even a filthy rich one, could've forged in secret, yet, our heroine completely unravels under what should've been easily handled, cynical questions (most from Sen James Woods who might've received an Oscar nomination himself) in an over-done show of emotion that completely conflicts with the strong-willed, spirited scientist-turned-space-traveler we'd come to cheer (""No evidence!"" As if the Greys are handing out souvenir key-chains to their Contactees) (oy). When your boyfriend (McConaughey), as cool a dude as he be, becomes your only booster, someone in the script department surely lost their writing compass.I like a good love story. Contact has a good love story. But the theme (planetary coupling) is too big for producers to've projected in half-measure. Zemeckis and WB erred in what appears a cave to fears of a status-quo backlash when they seriously deviated from Carl's novel by dumbing-it-down to implausibility (Senate snobs), maybe to intensify the love (Ellie-Palm), most likely to placate inter-galactic isolationists, i.e., god-fearing folk who worship for many reasons, though, ""pursuit of truth"" could hardly be called one of them, Joss (3.5/4).For a film which projects much better the hope that religion (""faith"") and science can, not only co-exist but work in harmony, watch Paramount's 1953 Technicolor adaptation of H.

142,jaddison383,Fascinating and True....,7,18 March 2007,"This movie still interests me every time I watch it. No, it is most certainly not a great or perfect film, and definitely not the best of the decade, as some have claimed. It is, however, a fascinating show of what would happen on Earth if Alien Contact were ever achieved. Everyone would freak.This is the story of a young scientist named Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) who has lived her entire life believing that there must be something else out there sharing the universe with us. Otherwise, it seems like an awful waste of space. After fighting a losing battle for years to keep her program alive, she finally discovers an alien message by complete chance. After further study, they then discover that it is the blue-prints for a machine to be used to send someone to (presumably) meet them. With that news spread to the world, so begins the chaos of human reaction as the world must decide how to act on this data.The story is brilliant, one of the best things about the movie. We have all wondered at one time or another in our lives if there were other beings trying to contact us from outer space. Could there be intelligent life-forms out there? If so, what do they want- are they hostile or benign? This is the question that is posed for America in this film, and the country reacts exactly as I imagine it would in real life: Skepticism, over-reaction, and fanaticism all inter-mingling with each other. The portrayal of how the human race reacts is so true, that it feels frighteningly real.The cast works very well at their individual roles. Jodie Foster shows her real acting chops once again as the dreamer-of-a-scientist who really is searching for just one thing: Meaning in her life. The supporting cast does just what they're supposed to: support. Matthew McConaughy plays the role of the man who is stuck between two worlds just fine, and James Woods, Tom Skerritt, David Morse, and Angela Bassett all turn in nice work. The real stand-out of the supporters is William Fichtner as Ellie's blind mentor. He does very well.It's a fine movie, one of the better science-fiction dramas for sure. However, it's not amazing, nor is it ground-breaking. It's just fun and interesting to watch every time. After all, that is what movies are supposed to be. 7/10 stars! Jay Addison",Contact
143,meritcoba,Gawd calling(gooodmorning America!),5,20 May 2016,"After spending a third of a trillion dollars Ellie, played by Jodie Foster, finds herself at the other end of a worm hole. That is to say: back on Earth. It took her 18 seconds to do so.Earth, inhabited by moronic creatures called humans, has just found itself to be the target of practical joker living on a planet orbiting Vega or thereabouts. Thereabouts cause that planet was probably just a relay station. It send them humans an instruction manual for building a device nobody on Vega or thereabouts could afford to build, hoping them dumb humans would do it. And they did. In fact, they made even two of them. How stupidly funny is that.To their great embarrassment one of the earthlings appeared so they sent it back with some garbled message that would have the slow witted creatures pondering stuff for the rest of their pathetic existence.What is next? Ellie asks her dead daddy, the guise the alien has assumed for her(and not Adolf H, which would have been funny). Well, we sent you back without a shred of evidence and nobody will believe you. And we erased all the tapes, and the audio and anything that could proof we exist. How about that? It will be just like.. a religion! You feel right at home!Fine with me, Ellie says. For as we have found out from the movie, Ellie doesn't believe in gawd.. but she does believe in something after having had her trip to another world. So she has become a spiritual person so she can have intercourse with the religious guy named Palmer Joss without feeling ashamed for it. (In hindsight the painful look on her face when she kisses Palmer might very well be because Foster was a closeted lesbian, which by Jove would at least have made the movie more interesting if Ellie had been too. Nuke them straight people! )So the whole movie, aptly named Contact, was about finding an excuse for the atheist (assumed closeted lesbian) Ellie to have (straight) intercourse with the Christian Palmer. Two third of a trillion dollars spent on matchmaking and brain reprogramming.. Does this movie get closure that way? Perhaps it does.The more I think of this movie, the lower my scoring. The biggest part of the movie turns around a conflict between science and religion, in which the latter means: the Christian faith of the American kind. 95 percent of the humans are religious someone says to atheist Ellie, which is why she doesn't get selected at first. She could have replied: but only a third of them are Christian. So who will it be? A Christian volunteer? A Muslim one? A Jewish? A Buddhist? Which religion shall be required? And if it will be Christian, which denomination? The catholic one? Oh and did I tell you about my sexual orientation? Only 4% of the female population confesses themselves to be lesbian. And how about white vs black vs Asian? What race shall represent earth? But we just skip over that one shall we.. cause, darn it, this is America and there is just one American gawd and that is the white Christian one and no other exist!And.. the American atheist gets to finally go after the American Christian dude and the first alien device gets blown to smithereens by an American religious nutcase cause them Americans prefer their own American atheist to go after all in their secretly build religious nutcase free intergalactic American travelling device version two so they can adorn the alien property with an American flag. Only they forgot to give her one. The nicest part of the movie is the beginning sequence, in which we see no humans at all. The camera travels backwards from the planet into outer space. Cool that! In between there are some more nice shots of desert landscapes and some sequences about the planets. As long as there are no humans in it, the movie is actually nice.Jodie Foster, how I like her, is at her worst here. She seems constantly on the brink of a nervous breakdown, about to scream or about to cry. Why did they send that nervous wreck to the aliens? No wonder they returned her and without any evidence so they will not send another one. Cause them humans are just too stupid to get that travelling through wormholes mucks with space and time. But you know.. Einstein is dead and with him all the brilliant scientists have died out.. Stephen Hawking? Never heard of the guy. Carl Sagan? Wasn't he a script writer for sci-fi movies? Higgs? Penrose? Witten? Just a bunch of loonies. The movie has also Blofield in it. He is named Hadden. Hadden is a deus ex machina. When the plot grounds to a halt, he steps in with a lotta money and gets it floating again. Jup.. the movie is almost brilliant. But there aren't any cats in it though so it remains almost.At the end of the movie Ellie is back were she started: in command of a large array of antennae listening to the universe. Did anything happen in between? Apparently not. It was all a dream probably or maybe she got back to another Earth in another universe? Isn't that her once deceased dad in the background walking toward her over a pearly white beach? What was it all about? Well we see her looking up at the night sky showing a milliard sparkling stars. She has become that spiritual person in which the scientist and the religious nutcase have become one. I feel at peace with the universe now. So let's depart with that gooey feeling. Yuck!",Contact

The movie is not really bad or somehow I just do not like the attitude I have a real problem with the message and it uses the very movie crew I despise. I do not want to talk badly about the director or the actors because they are doing their best, I rather want to trash the scriptwriter. I hate him the most because of the combination of things that happen here. (I know that the movie is based on a novel but that does not matter.) So my conclusion is great idea, fantastic camera work, awesome effects but the less I hear from this movie and see for the rest of my life the better.

When Ms. Foster gets to where she's going, she encounters a land that resembles more a cosmic Club Med or a Near Death Experience with surf and sand, where she has a mystical meeting with her long-dead father (played by a superb and nuanced David Morse), it wasn't exactly what I had expected, to be honest. In the end, as all good yarns often do, it brought forth more questions than it answered, which is how it should be, given the psycho/social implications it attempts to weave. But as much as I was truly moved by her inter-dimensional reunion with her beloved father, alas, even the ironic final moment of the film seemed once again to fall flat. Again, if sentimental moments briefly shared by a separated daughter and dad are your cup of tea, this film will at least succeed on that minor point.

Foster's character is so perfect, she is revered like a priestess. There is little else in Contact that is explored in depth much beyond this holy quest of the Foster character.Besides being too perfect, I say the Foster character is holy because the rest of the world in this film is filled with spiteful, small minded and just weird people.

The public at large are portrayed as a mass of howling primates who blindly flock from one big event to another. In this mass of humanity religious followers from New Age to traditional get to be trashed in broad strokes as mindless fools singing and dancing in some trance. Finally, Contact claims there are super rich folks living in airplanes flying around the world or in outer space just waiting to meet alien species.With all of these extreme stereotyped characters and the circus atmosphere, I am reminded of a satire such as Mars Attacks or a tongue in cheek sci-fi disaster yarn like Independence Day. But Contact wants to be taken seriously. This is Carl Sagan's story after all.Well, the film briefly tries to create a meaningful relationship for Foster with the character played by Matthew MacConaughey. But soon MacConaughey's role also becomes paper thin as he becomes the comforter to the persecuted Jodi who is like Joan of Arc on trial.All of this would be forgivable if there was a serious consideration of what our involvement with an alien species would mean. Excellent films that deal with this topic include 2001 and Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Here is where Contact falls flat. In an overly explained series of scenes mirroring 2001 Foster sort of meets an alien then quickly returns to earth. Foster's experience is like a dream. Who are the aliens and what would contact with them mean to us? The movie doesn't go there. There is a vacuum of ideas here as empty as space. The story simply goes back to Foster being the persecuted noble scientist.Out of all of this, the final message of Contact is that fundamental scientific research, that has little immediate practical value, requires faith. It is like a religious philosophy in a way with one difference being that we are supposed to fund it with tax dollars. Considering all of this, there is very little I can say in praise of the movie besides that Foster's acting is good as always and that technically the film is well made.The whole movie felt like a fund drive on public television, ""give money to the poor scientists"". If Contact is one big ad for astronomy research at least make alien contact more interesting. And finally, to create a noble character you do not have to belittle the rest of the world.",Contact
150,Sinnerman,"Embrace ideas, not belief structures.",10,17 November 2002,"""Contact"" is one of my all time favourite films. I am intrigued by its balanced presentation on technology and spirituality. I am thankful for its liberating ideas and concepts, on what makes the species of man so rare and precious.It speaks to people like me in particular, who believe in the presence of a higher being, but not necessarily one with a Christian/ Catholic persuasion.
To me, Faith should be universal. It should be built freely around ideas and ideals, not belief structures. More often than not, the hierarchical bureaucracy of organised religion cripples our judgement. Scaring us into obedience and dictating our actions does not enlighten our search for truth and the nature of being. It only serves to restrict our freedom. Freedom to explore and freedom to evolve. Freedom, to be human.""Contact"" is thus a special and timely film. Equally thought provoking and heartfelt, it is required viewing for people struggling, with their faith, with their lives and the very meaning of their existence.",Contact

153,kols,Well Done,9,6 May 2013,"Jodi Foster makes this movie, with strong assists from Matthew McConaughey and Tom Skerritt. McConaughey does a good job with a difficult and contradictory character by trying to juxtapose the character's desire to believe in a generalist (philosophical definition) God with the humanist ethic of valuing the individual. Doesn't always work.Skerritt's character is more one-dimensional and so, so familiar for anyone who's every encountered one of these types in academia, the military or business hierarchies. Hard to see them as human and Skerritt does a bang-up job of portraying the type.But it's Foster's performance as Arroway that lights-up the screen. Jena Malone (young Ellie) needs to be mentioned here for her own stellar performance in setting the stage for Foster and making the transition believable. But once Foster appears, that's the ballgame. Even when plot elements break down (great script but it does breakdown when the contradictions overwhelm it), Foster's performance carries through. You could care less about the plot.And there are a lot of plot breakdowns, particularly in terms of the logistics of the Contact. First one: Vega never received coherent radio or TV transmissions from Earth - they would have dissipated before leaving the Solar System, let alone covering 25 light years. Secondly, the first thing any culture would do is establish its identity, the ""Me Tarzan"" thing. Then there's the Machine - schematics sent without any description of what, precisely, it does. Sell me a bridge.And then there's a whole host of other problems - if the Vegans had the technology to build such a machine, why not use it instead of beaming signals limited to the speed of light? Surely they would have the technology to identify Earth and do a spectrographic analysis of our atmosphere to see if it was compatible with theirs. And, assuming they could parse images out of those primitive TV signals, why not watch a while and then send a slightly more personal and focused message? But that's not what the movie's about and the suspension of disbelief covers most of those issues.The movie is really about the Wonder of the Universe and the point of the Contact is to emphasis that wonder, not watching alien home movies. So, as illogical as it is, it makes a lot more dramatic sense to portray the Contact as a great mystery sent to us for unraveling.This is where Malone and Foster's performances shine, projecting that sense of wonder with energy and passion from the first scene to the last, gluing your eyes to the screen.Personally, the only part I didn't buy was her brief sojourn at where-ever-it-was beachy kind of place where she met her father again and what the hell is this all about? I get it in dramatic and thematic terms but, for me, it grates like a bad dream sequence. Even at that, the movie recovers magnificently by focusing on the What Happened? issue after the capsule just kind of goes splat! when the Machine is turn on. Empirically, nothing - it just drops despite Arroway's passionate insistence she went Somewhere.While the Somewhere doesn't work for me as a Somewhere, it works better than a prosaic Welcome to Vegan, Earthling! sign would have so you take what you get. And I found the What Happened controversy surprising engaging as it led to the final scene, Foster sitting on the edge of a New Mexican cliff and seeing the Universe in a handful of soil. Blake, anyone?That is what Contact is all about, Emerson and Blake: seeing the Universe in a grain of sand and the Transcendent perception of its workings. Foster's performance is an elegant expression of that quest.",Contact

""How the heck am I going to end this"".Turning the book into a movie was a great effort and they have captured all the drama and issues and done such a great job on the writing and production parts. The ending is still a bit disappointing, but I can cope with that. The conflict between science and religious stupidity is just so ""American"", and it seems that nothing much has changed in the years that followed.I am particularly impressed with the Clinton sections, (even though the movie is set in 1988 and he wasn't Pres then). It shows just what can be done at the Weta workshops, they have taken archive footage, got someone to imitate the voice, then digitally morphed the mouth to get it all synchronised. A great job. I would guess that even Bill is happy with the result.The fact that my own view is that SETI is a waste of time doesn't alter my view of the movie. Other worlds? OK, possible, probable even, but it is not just intelligent life we want to know about, after all, the dinosaurs had some intelligence, so did Abraham, and Mozart, and Shakespeare, Edison et al. It is advanced intelligence we want, with radio telescopes and transmitters. We have had radio telescopes since about 1950, so that means that what I call the ""window of opportunity"", is only open about one millionth of its range, or even less, depending on how far back you want to go to say there was ""intelligent life"" present.

In 2006, with the on-going Iraq war and the massive tensions between Western and Islamic values, more Americans would vote for a Muslim than an atheist. Now THAT is alarming.I'm not making a statement against Muslims here. I'm just shocked that, in spite of the Islamophobia, in spite of the radical fundamentalists in (nuclear?) Iran, in spite of the Muslims holding the no. 1 spot as Villains in movies, news and culture, Americans still think atheists are more untrustworthy.This is one of Contact's points. Without spoiling anything, it's safe to say that Jodie Foster's character is held back thanks to her (non)-belief. Instead, the good stuff goes to the believer, and in a spot of irony, it's also lost thanks to a believer. When I first saw Contact, I didn't find it very realistic that all the religious people would be more content with choosing a contending religion instead of a neutral part, but the numbers above stumps me.All politics aside, Contact is a great movie. The first scene sets the scope perfectly and beautifully. Some scenes are very, very tense, thankfully avoiding the Hollywood Happy Music and instead going for a subtle, dramatic and threatening score.This and Silence of the Lambs will always be the two best Jodie Foster movies. Even though she is a great actress, I can't believe she will ever top this. She is nicely balanced by Matthew McConaughey, who, coincidentally, is a man of faith. Jake Busey plays a truly unsettling character, Joseph, who shows the greatest sides of blind faith. We even get to see some of William Fichtner, which I always consider a bonus in a movie.The plot is grand, to say the least. Carl Sagan always was a man of visions and even though I have not read the book, I can feel the scope and scale of it is very Sagan. Some people mean that Sagan's strong anti-religious stance in the book is diluted in the movie, which may or may not be true. Personally, I think a movie that wants to open a dialog is worth more than one dismissing the other idea all together.When all's said and done, Contact is one of the greatest science-fiction movies ever made, in the genre's purest form. People who dislike Star Wars, Star Trek, Alien and the like, should not worry; Contact is thoughtful and more about humanity than anything else. It's rating here at IMDb, an American site, reinforces the aforementioned figures. Had it been the same movie with a pro-religious message, I think this would have been high up in the top 250, and I hope that one day it will be.",Contact
159,scott-sw,One of my favorites of the 1990's,10,7 June 2008,"I will go a step further and say this is one of my favorite movies ever. I found it though-provoking, awe-inspiring, deep, thoughtful, analytical, and powerful. Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) is a young, gifted scientist who is eager in finding the proof of extra-terrestrial life. This has been her ambition since the death of her father. She cannot fathom a universe so big without any other life, considering it a ""waste of space."" Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey) is a religious leader who crosses paths with her. Ironically, while he believes in God, Ellie is an atheist and demands proof of the existence of everything. At odds with Ellie is Dr. David Drumlin (Tom Skerrit) who keeps pulling the funding from Ellie's crusade. He eventually becomes the White House Adviser on Science. Suddenly, Ellie finds the proof she has been looking for. A definite signal comes from the star, Vega, which is roughly 26 light-years from Earth. They apparently intercepted a signal, then sent it back with their own schematics for a device that will likely transport someone somewhere. The White House takes over this project, and several nations join to build the massive device. Of course, Ellie wants to go, but vying for the honor are several others and she must compete. Then, the politics begin. The politics behind building and technology rights, who will go, and who will implement public policy. Some people expect hostile aliens, others consider them friends, and many people see it as the ultimate religious experience. I like this movie for so many reasons. At the outset is the politicking that goes on. It mirrors what the real world would be like if such a thing would happen. This leads to the wonderful acting that goes along with it. We all know the over-zealous pragmatist Mr. Kitz (James Wood), the level-headed White House Chief of Staff (Angela Bassett), the conservative religious leader Richard Rank (Rob Lowe), and the wise and insightful Kent (William Ficthner). We know a grand-stander and opportunist like Drumlin (Skerritt). What pushes this movie over the top, though, is the direction of Robert Zemickis. This is undoubtedly his best movie to date, even outshining his previous effort, Forest Gump. He adapts Carl Sagan's novel into a tour-de-force that not only lets us see how our society would truly react to such a thing, but also the dire consequences. He casts enough story, doubt, and confusion to make us wonder what really happened ... until the end. It also delivers a subtle, powerful message without being preachy or over-the-top. I left the movie theater awe-struck in a deep, profound way. I was scared, nervous, and moved. I have contended Contact was sorely over-looked in the Academy Awards because of the entertaining but over-hyped Titanic. It should have been nominated for best picture. Too bad. It was truly majestic ... and my favorite picture of 1997.",Contact

161,alexx668,Contact,6,23 August 2008,"""Contact"" is an interesting film, which primarily isn't about whether we're alone in space or not. Mostly it seems to examine and contrast three distinct types of personalities: the idealist scientist (Eleanor Arroway), the religious believer (Palmer Joss) and the logical strategist/ manipulator (David Drumlin or Michael Kitz). The film bridges the first two types (in the end Arroway's motivation is driven purely by faith, while Joss' faith reaches beyond religion), while the third type is the one that's really in control of mankind's destiny (the manipulative Drumlin gets the mission initially, while the cold logic of Kitz and co demands they cover up what really happened).Philosophically-wise, the film goes for a kind of expanding and ""exterior"" way of thinking. When Arroway meets the aliens (mind, in the guise of her dead father) they reveal that there are many civilizations in the universe etc but that mankind (in their own words capable of beautiful dreams and horrible nightmares, and always feeling void and alone) must find it's own way and in ""slow moves"". Also, they reveal that ""the only thing that makes the emptiness bearable, is each other"".The film is rather tame and fairly predictable in it's stand. When Arroway meets the aliens, she could be talking to God. Returning to Earth without any solid proof, she doesn't convince about what was essentially a religious experience. The film exhibits this bridging of science and religion with ridiculous amounts of melodrama, in the usual slow-motion emotional-exploitation sequences and mellifluous strings. Standing as some sort of middle-ground between ""2001, A Space Odyssey"" (man reaching for the outwards) and ""Solaris"" (man delving in the inwards), the problem is that director Robert Zemeckis is neither a Stanley Kubrick nor an Andrey Tarkovsky.",Contact

164,matlefebvre20,"If ""2001"" was made today",8,6 May 2006,"""Contact"" begins and ends on the same note. We still search for truth.This astronomical adventure, directed by Robert Zemeckis, bases its characters on one single principle: if we're alone in the universe, why does it have to be so big? I find that question very interesting. It's food for thought for those who don't believe in extraterrestrials. Personally, I believe that aliens do exist, but I don't think that events such as those depicted in this movie will happen someday.But even if this story is one of the craziest space quests ever presented, we must admire it for what it is. It feels like a modern re-telling of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", which was made 30 years earlier. However, Zemeckis doesn't share Kubrick's pessimistic and cold view of human race and he shows us a metaphor which sends messages of hope, belief and wonder about universe.The movie is about brilliant astronomer Ellie Arroway, who is magnificently played by Jodie Foster. Ellie's father died of a heart attack during a meteor shower when she was a child and since, she devoted her life to the search for an extraterrestrial intelligence in our universe. Her obsession seems to be granted when her team receives a strange message from Vega.After a twisted series of deciphering, which includes prime numbers, the 1936 Olympic Games and an alien alphabet, scientists find out that the message contains instructions for building a transport machine. With the help of flamboyant and enigmatic billionaire S.R. Hadden (played by John Hurt), the machine is built and it sends Ellie in outer-space, much like Dave was sent through the star-gate in ""2001"".But while Kubrick only focused on the scientific aspects of such an adventure, Zemeckis shows us what does humanity think about it. And not everyone shares the same enthusiasm than the world scientists. It is well represented by religious fanatics (even extremists) and Ellie's boyfriend, theologian and writer Palmer Joss (played by Matthew McConaughey).It's unique, because no other movie has ever taken in consideration the delicate but strong opposition between science and faith. And it's presented in a very memorable way. I have to say that religion receives a mild cold shower in the movie, especially when a religious leader bombs the machine, so the scientific expedition would be aborted.This divergence of opinion is very present within the two main characters, Ellie and Palmer. But in spite of their differences, the chemistry between them is strongly believable and much appreciable. And even if characters take second place prior to the visual effects, there are highlights. Beside Ellie and Palmer relationship, there is the bombing of the first machine, which gives to the viewer a sense of frustration and grief. And there's Ellie's unexplainable and mystic encounter with her father during her travel among the stars.Even if emotions are a good substance, it's the visual effects that steal the show. It all begins with the opening sequence, which is a trip among planets, stars and galaxies all the way to young Ellie's eyes... Then, Zemeckis proves himself very good with television screens as he presents living personalities much like he did in ""Forrest Gump"". We can see Bill Clinton, Larry King, CNN journalists and broadcasters, but I strongly liked Jay Leno's appearance with one of the funniest jokes I've heard on screen.And like ""2001"", the icing of the cake is the space travel sequence itself. We feel like we're stranded in a roller coaster car and we travel ourselves among the stars, the colors, the lights and every trick accomplished by Industrial Light & Magic.With emotion, drama, mystery, science awareness, religion and visual spectacle, ""Contact"" can boast itself of being one of the greatest science fiction movies of recent years. It's a strongly realistic presentation of modern astronomy and it's far more convincing than other modern alien films in the mood of ""Independence Day"" which, in this case, shows data like if it was falling from the sky. So, whether you believe in aliens or not, and whether you are of scientific or religious mood, this film will definitely please every moviegoer in the universe.",Contact

Unfotunately, it's occasionally pulled back down to less rarefied atmospheres under the weight of its overwrought, clunky romantic malfunctions. Jody Foster's character's atheism may be used against her to deny her the opportunity to fulfill a lifetime dream, and her attraction to the man responsible for this possible denial is played for all it's melodramatic, soap opera worth. And Jodie Foster - a consummate pro whose career credits are the envy of any working actor - is here just so relentlessly earnest and strident, and as focused as a cobra poised to strike. It's a bit of a one note performance, and maybe a little tiring. She does, of course, posses a wonderfully photogenic face which we are invited to scrutinize at great length in the countless increasingly tight close ups of her tense square jaw and piecing baby blue eyes. The special effects are a bit sketchy by today's astronomically high standards, but 15 years ago I imagine audience's were sufficiently impressed. The most glaring weakness are the matte painting backgrounds upon which has been place a considerable responsibility to generate awe and wonder, but their unnatural cartooniness is distracting. Most of the other digital effects are executed sufficiently well enough to serve the increasingly exciting action. The effects, and in fact the entire film very effectively plays off our collective memory of other classic landmark Sci-Fi films, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind, and even The Andromeda Strain with its terse and clinical scientific dialog executed with icy cold precision. These three films are certainly very fine company to be keeping and Contact earns its position by virtue of the challenging and unique questions raised by its intelligent script.

Foster is arguably the _only_ actress who could carry the character of Dr. Ellie Arroway: brilliant, enthusiastic, strong but vulnerable, and unself-consciously sexy. Fine supporting performances are given by Matthew McConaughey (who in my opinion is unfairly trashed by critics), Tom Skerrit (who escapes the customary one-dimensionality of sci-fi antagonists), and David Morse. There are a host of walk-ons by journalists and public figures, from Dee Dee Myers up to Bill Clinton, but the best cameo is reserved for Rob Loew, who is _perfectly_ cast.Zemeckis excels in fleshing out settings, and his efforts in CONTACT are among his best. The TV clips and the ad hoc RV city in the New Mexico desert are especially delightful. The big set piece, a catastrophic explosion, is also excellent; the sense of immediacy and sickening dread as the event unfolds is reminiscent of what one experiences when seeing actual video footage of an air-show crash or a race car careening into the crowd. Possibly the most memorable scene in the film is the opening astronomical sequence, which will equally delight the professional astronomer and the scientifically uninitiated. Just that one scene is worth the price of buying the movie to watch over and over.The laserdisc transfer, which features Dolby Digital sound, is technically very good (especially the sound), although probably not among the very best. I would probably check out the DVD version first.",Contact

The book, comparably, had a lot of filler and the movie pared the tale down beautifully. Still, the book was powerful in that very detail.Jodie Foster, while unlike the book's character, is wonderful. And thank the stars her love interest is Matthew McConaughey and not the circus-tattooed-lightening-struck fellow Sagan envisioned. All is forgiven for that fact alone. I personally would second guess a trip to the cosmos to spend my remaining years with Matt.The power of Sagan's idea- the consideration of life Elsewhere imposed on accepted Earth Science- is carried out in this movie. The details of plot don't matter, really. Sagan's point is well taken and faithfully conveyed.",Contact

Especially considering that the movie was built in 1997, you can see that it is more impressive and realistic than many movies made about science today.Towards the end of the movie, Eleanor Arroway is trying to explain the feelings that she could not prove, but lived and felt. This means that everything that is actually in religion (Islam) cannot be proved by the human mind. Some things must be accepted. In this film, atheists can see that there is some evidence of dialogue to support their own views. But at the end of the movie, when they see what I wrote above, they must understand that they are wrong.
(I exclude exploding the space shuttle made by exploiting religion.)References are made to many things in the movie. If you watch the movie paying attention to every detail, you will notice them. Although Eleanor made the discovery himself, David Drumli stole it from him; Tesla-Edison was a reference to the duo. I don't think the new generation that has grown up with technology in 2019 can understand this.

Frankly, I was disappointed; I found it very talky, more pretentious than profound (as if, for a largely science-fiction-fan audience, there's anything daring or even controversial in the notion of funding scientific research and reaching out to possible extraterrestrial life!), freighted with a truly awful, unwatchable performance by Matthew McConaughey (with his accent, popping eyes, and bared teeth, he seems to be doing a bad impression of William F. Buckley, Jr.), and featuring only two action scenes, one of them genuinely gripping, the other so-so. // What interested me more than the film itself was listening to two of the three commentaries included on the DVD. The one by director Robert Zemeckis addressed itself almost entirely to the complicated and expensive special effects that seem a component of just about every scene; it's an initially interesting subject that eventually grows tedious and rather dry. Conversely, the voice-over commentary by Jodie Foster shows that this intelligent actress and filmmaker is even brainier, more thoughtful, and more articulate than I'd imagined. Her performance in the commentary is, in fact, even more impressive and gratifying than her performance on screen.",Contact
180,andrewburgereviews,Religion. Science. Politics,10,22 May 2021,"Robert Zemeckis' ""Contact"" can be a very flawed movie if you want it to be. Yet it avoids accruing any critics from my side because of how daring it is. It finds itself at the universal crossroads between science, religion and politics. Other movies have been there as well but no other has put the question so bluntly: ""Do you believe in God?""--if yes, why and if not why not?It is ambitious, pretentious, it engages existential questions without worrying too much about how logically absurd it is. This is why most people would hate it, but it is exactly why I love it so much. It contains many panoramic frames, but unlike other movies is not trying to show just how small we are, but rather it wants to contain everything--from a field of radars, to a sci-fi machine and space itself.Movies like ""Contact"" rarely succeed, but when they do their due is usually great. Zemeckis knew that Carl Sagan's novel takes place in almost a parallel universe so he has no issues with adapting logic to its own benefit. If the message is insightful and powerful enough, the result is a masterpiece, if not, is a laughable dud. Luckily, ""Contact"" insists on many taboo themes and does them well enough to come out on top.Each character is well-defined and have very flushed out principles. From Doctor Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster) the secular scientist who makes finding life on other planets an obsession more than a job to religious author Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey) carrying the flag of belief and able to appear almost everywhere for some reason and to opportunist David Drumlin (Tom Skerritt) who is a good guy, but doesn't flinch when the moment arises. In a way, he wants the same thing that Ellie does, yet he lacks Ellie's emotional wisdom. Her love for the stars is perhaps a result of her mother's early death; deep down is her she is really searching for.In the end, ""Contact"" doesn't answer any questions about life on another planets, but that is because Sagan's reliance on science and its lack of facts regarding spacefaring--any answers who could've been given are hypothetical at best. Instead, ""Contact"" focuses on emotional reactions, reactionary beliefs and both rational and spiritual experiences. The love Sagan shows to both secularism and faith is what made this movie earn my respect.",Contact

The actual contact with the alien dives into hocus-pocus fantasy. Then the idea that things are arranged to give the traveler almost no proof of the encounter seems ludicrous.

I found myself wanting to yell at the screen during the movie many times when the entire planet's field of experts could not seem to figure out something that was so obvious to me.  The ""religious"" elements of the story were just plain dumb.  Does anyone recall there being a belief test for astronauts before?  What was really amazing was that this religious extremism on the part of the government was supposed to be happening during the Clinton administration.  There was not one believable character in the government plot.There was no hint of scientific method.  The science was just plain bad.I'm reminded of many Star Trek episodes where someone says they heard voices or saw a vision.  The are immediately discounted as having stress problems or some other mental problem.  This on a ship where this type of stuff happens all the time.  This movie does this as well.  It protrays the entire world as not willing to pay any attention to what someone says when it's unexpected.  What did they expect?  I could go on and on and about Contact.

Humanity gets plans for a machine that can supposedly get people elsewhere in the universe... a sort of Heaven.To be sure, I am not convinced that the machine so much gets people to the Other Side and doesn't create the illusion by analyzing the thoughts of its 'passengers' -- but the ambiguity looks intentional.The satire of anti-rational religious figures, UFO cultists, political extremists, and the like is exactly as one would expect from Sagan, someone who long told us that space travel to the stars would be so difficult that it might not be worth the effort.

His tenacity, motivation and fascination with outer space, bore fruit. The topic: ""fight for a dream"" appears perfectly reflected here.This is a story in which science, beliefs, relationships, challenges, are interspersed.Science and spirituality had always been separated as two different or opposite worlds.With quantum physics, their paths have had no choice but to cross, and finally have agreed.

I almost laugh at the way their received images, having the alien's designs coming together in a cube shape, would something even use a design like this? Imagine how long it could seriously take to understand what came in a signal that includes image formats and whatever else.Then when they quickly get the stuff built, it gets blown-up by some terrorist guy. I can understand someone wanting to blow-up something from the aliens, but then there's a second built version which is unknown to the public and actually only gets to work for the privately built second try. The immediate success in their sudden second location was rather bazaar and lame. Especially when they finally believe the story of her talk with the aliens after nothing but finding extra length in the recordings.

Her doting dad dies one day, and she grows up desperate to prove his theory of life in space by making 'Contact' with extraterrestrial lifeforms. Title drop.

201,arminhage,Not perfect but highly watchable,7,16 December 2014,"Contact with alien life form is an ever green story concept for movies. There are 2 very distinct categories.The first type is actually showing the aliens. Among them the most recent was Ridley Scott's ""Prometheus"" which I have mixed feelings about or more traditionally the Star Wars or Star Trek series. The second type is not showing the aliens at all and often has some sort of open ending, probably the most famous is Kubrick's ""2001"".Both types are considered a double sided blade. If the shown alien is not appealing enough or is not wrapped in properly sequenced mystery, it will be categorized as 2 bit science fiction and in case of unseen alien, the end of the movie may not be appealing to the target audience, the younger people.I recall the first time I got my hand on this movie, then on a VHS tape and I simply bypassed it because it looked too slow and talky for my age, I was 17 or 18. Now at age 34 I watched it and I really enjoyed it specially after seeing shams like Interstellar!The screenplay is solid with minimal holes. Everything has an explanation which passes to the audience mostly by vision not just words. Probably the most interesting part is the opening, the further we move from earth, the further we move back in time. I consider it a masterpiece, there is no narrative but just video, motion and it passes what it intends. I have to admit that I loved it and I got hooked immediately. The underlaying love story is touching and full of chemistry although it was never a main part of movie and virtually had nothing to do with the resolve. I'm not a scientist but as an space enthusiast I know some stuff about physics. Of course most of the scientific part was fiction but not in a bad way. One who is familiar with these things would only say ""Its possible"". Movie is rather long and with minimal action but never bores.Of course there is some issues. From the discovery of the alien machine plans to actually building it moved very fast which never happens in reality as just decoding the plans and manufacturing the parts takes years to achieve, no need to mention that some technologies need to be developed just to make parts even if the blue print is available otherwise every single industrial nation on earth would replicate the B2 bomber in 6 months. Making something out of a blue print is way different than the reverse engineering. That's forgivable as this is a movie and no one wants to see the beautiful Ellie to go to space in her 70s! Probably the biggest question mark is that why the tribunal in congress. The machine and the pod looked like intact after the experience so send another one to confirm. That was a real hole in the screenplay which could have been easily fixed by somehow destroying the machine after experience. a 500 billion dollar machine got destroyed and of course no one has the money to rebuild it but if the machine is intact which it was, all those things after the launch was nonsense. This is something that I can not bypass, there should be no holes in screenplay, if there is hole, movie loses stars and this one lost one star for that.The second star was lost because of failure to come with a logical explanation why the aliens sent the blueprint. She traveled through multiple wormholes to another universe to see an alien disguised himself as her dad in Pensacola. And that illusion actually said nothing to her nor showed anything and sent her back. That small steps he mentioned actually was not a step at all however I can not blame Carl Sagan (Author of the novel) and other people who were involved with the story as it is extremely complicated.

Ellie, representing the scientist, is faced with experience that lies beyond her scientific explanation, yet she cannot let go of its reality to her.Palmer Joss is excellent, not as the representative of the religious, but as representative of the position we might do well to take - the line between the two extremes, the balance-seeker who can communicate beyond his own language (not one Bible text quoted, yet a decent defence of the room for ""God"").The bigger antennae is not a matter of technology, but, as we see in the last scene, of tuning in, making ""contact"" not with what's ""out there,"" but with what's inside of us - is it not more than just atomic activity?Meaning - a key theme, is shown to be lacking in the outlook on life these days, lacking in the continual pursuit of technological advance. Science alone is insufficient to give meaning that we are able to conceive and contemplate.This is a relevant thinking movie, for those who've thought that science and religion must antagonize.

209,vfrickey,A very nice distillation of Carl Sagan's novel,8,30 January 2014,"I don't usually think much of screen adaptations of novels; they often come out being very different stories, and seldom better than the novels.Contact is a pleasant surprise. It's a very extensive rework of the story told by astrophysicist and science writer Carl Sagan, and for a wonder, every change is for the better. Partly, I suspect that this is because the screenwriters who did the adaptation are simply better writers than Dr. Sagan was. While Contact is a great story about how contact with a civilization from another star system might actually occur, Sagan didn't tell it as well as other writers might have. He spent a lot of time grinding his ideological axes from cover to cover. Sagan's points were almost all well-taken, but for someone who likes to throw the term ""chiliast"" (another word for ""extremist"" which sounds like it refers to molesting little kids with Southwestern cooking) around in his prose, Sagan gets a little chiliastic in Contact himself. The screenwriters dialed that back a LOT from the novel while still making Sagan's points for him. They probably made his points BETTER than he did by not being as intense about it.Jodie Foster is probably the very best cast for Ellen Arroway available, having had the requisite brains to get into Yale in real life, she makes a very convincing scientist, very much like the brilliant women I've known in science and medicine over my career. She's also got acting tools too well-praised to need further praise from me. Matthew McConaughey did yeoman work with that the screenwriters gave him to work with, the extensively re-written character ""Palmer Joss.""It's not his fault that while this character's much more believable than the original from the novel (Sagan's Palmer Joss was almost a caricature as originally written, and seldom more than two-dimensional), there are still difficult things to believe about how the movie's Palmer Joss behaves. But McConaughey did his usual great work with what he had.I'm not going into plot development further than that because Contact's so well-written, directed and performed that you deserve to experience every single part of it for the first time.Contact's not just a great movie. It tells the story Carl Sagan intended to write the way he should have.",Contact
210,info-11400,Intellectually disappointing,5,23 December 2011,"It was only now that I actually made it to watch this movie as a whole. I always had some kind of sympathy for the shattered parts I had seen before and I was very hopeful for this film to get the theme right, as it was based on a story of C. Sagan.Well, now I am truly disappointed.Our main character is a strict scientist, more than most I have ever met personally. She is based deeply in the philosophy of modern natural science. Citing Ocam's razor it is fairly easy to state being an atheist. And she shows some stubborn philosophical issues real atheists tend to display as well.In the end, a person like that goes on to a journey to the stars. Returning without any serious proof. The experience she has is more than doubtful. Just the notion of meeting her father on another star's shore makes it highly probable, the whole thing is just a hallucination of some sort. Maybe induced by the strange electromagnetic effects of the (alien) machine.If the main character lived up to her inner believes, she would be the first to admit. But no, she rather ignores this, and winds up with the man, who is - albeit a strictly religious person - her lover. Giving up all conviction, blending with a religious philosophy, losing herself, for a man!? Farewell to Ocam and all foundations of modern science.This is strictly unbearable, if you got any kind of believe or philosophy. There is no possible accord between religion and nowadays science. These positions are natural enemies. And Contact tries to wipe the fundamental conflict away.Of course people with contradicting philosophies can fall in love. Philosophy and even religion do not really matter in the end. Well, at least if you kept some sanity to yourself. But they do not need to blend into each other. The main character of this movie for sure would not.And I am not talking about the logical holes in the plot line. Why would national security get involved, if it takes for any message 26 years to travel to the other side? That means actually you send something and receive an answer 52 years later! Why would the government hold back information (18 hours of video recording that should not exist) if the same government has to justify the costs of 600 Trillion (!) Dollars. Ridiculous! In the end and at the end the movie falls apart. Starting up as a rather credible and accurate story about the first contact to an alien civilization.

213,Jeremy-93,"an ideas movie without the ideas, partly salvaged by its star",5,10 June 2001,"Jodie Foster can almost persuade you that this great flat slab of a film has some real weight. She's a master of the art not of rising above her material but appearing to raise the material itself, and she's terrific here, giving a concentrated and beautifully controlled performance as someone who has built toughness around herself like a metal sphere, who's pathologically driven, emotionally not so much fragile as seemingly broken beyond repair. Contact works best on its psychological level, as a portrait of the scientist as a young orphan, and it's worth seeing for Foster's performance, as well as for a couple of bravura effects sequences.Overall, though, it does not work either as philosophy or as drama, something that becomes painfully obvious when almost anyone but Foster is on screen. Contact wants to persuade you that it's a counterblast to the pulping and Hollywooding of science fiction, that it's a film of ideas. It's just that when you look closely, there are no ideas, no insights, just a set of stagy confrontations between crude and unconvincingly-depicted representations of certain types - the will to power, the will to faith, the will to knowledge.  They argue at each other for a bit (quite a bit, actually), there's a fantastic voyage, quite beautifully rendered, to a destination which comes straight out of TV movie land, and then we're back to the arguing at each other again.  This is a film that believes it can attain profundity by having its characters make statements a lot; it's addicted to the obvious, unimaginatively directed, slackly edited and with damaging plot holes, and has nothing whatever to say to anyone about anything that you couldn't get from the back of a cereal packet.With a couple of honourable exceptions the supporting cast do the opposite of supporting, mostly because their roles are so banal that there really wasn't anything to be done with them.  McConnaughey is unspeakably dreadful as the token lurve interest, while, more surprisingly, John Hurt is just embarrassing in a small but dramatically pivotal role.  The honourable mentions go to Jena Malone as Jodie in flashbacks - an excellent match for the star - and William Fichtner as the likeable Kent (one of the film's few concessions to subtlety is its not labouring the character's blindness, where lots of nudges about Vision would have been more characteristic), while Tom Skerritt as the opportunist Drumlin - not a good role - has a couple of good moments.  But this is Foster's show, and if you watch it to see her, plus a few belated minutes of visual grandeur that really do convey the sense of wonder for which the dialogue thrashes about so feebly, you'll find things to admire here, if not much to enjoy or excite.",Contact
214,mhajs,Do you believe in aliens? I do !,10,13 February 2006,"**** out of ****The reason I like sci-fi movies better than fantasy movies (two of the genres which most tells fictional stories) is that the sci-fi movies gives us a vision of the future. It may be about how the world will look like a few years from now or what are we doing at the moment which will result in something even bigger in the future. Contact follows that pattern.Jodie Foster plays Eleanor Arroway, most of the time, called Ellie. Her character is simply amazing, she's a scientist who, since childhood developed interest in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence and communications. To see her working is a delight. I find it really an art to study the outer space, listening to sounds in earphones and marking stars as already checked and negative as a result for alien search.While she meets Palmer Joss, played by Matthew McCounaughey, a theology student, writer and believer of God's existence itself, the movie show us a conflict between science and religion from the point of view of the two characters, since she believes only in science, while he believes in god, but also thinks science is important, although not at a point where you might give your life for it. This movie reminds me a lot of the Dan Brown novel, Angels & Demons. It's about a discovery made by Ellie, concerning life outside our planet. The story unfolds really amazing. Director Robert Zemeckis is one of my favorites. The ending though might surprise people in an unexpected way.I recommend it to any sci-fi freak.

218,Alex-Tsander,Ya Gotta Have Faith!,6,31 March 2005,"Although I read Sagan's ""Cosmic Connection"" as a teenager, when it was first published and can say that it had some influence upon me, I have not read ""Contact"" and can only view the movie on it's own terms.Whilst the movie reflects great intellectual ambition the end result is entertaining but without any serious depth. In particular, we are subjected to an immense amount of rumination upon the ""spiritual"", ""belief"" and ""faith"" but at a level of very puerile Sunday-school philosophy. A matter made worse by the role in this of the flunked priest and presidential adviser who seems to have been intended as both the love element and a figure of integrity. He actually comes across as smarmy, disingenuous, hypocritical, selfish and ultimately bereft of a true ""moral compass"". In spite of his pompous pontifications about his buddy relationship with God, he acts purely on a self-interest basis and to be frank, is a bit of a reptile.To an extent, the story seems to have been turned into an anti-science rant, which I cannot believe Sagan intended. The plot doesn't help. Having created a wonderful enigma ( what really happened cannot be answered ) which is expressive of so much in the scientific experience, it then destroy's this effect by revealing ( back-stage as it were ) a secret piece of evidence that confirms that there was in fact proof of only one version of what had happened! Maybe the producers didn't have faith in the audience's ability to handle the question.In any case, if the alternative explanation of a hoax needed to be tested, it would have been easy to find out one way or another if that was the case, now that Haddon was dead!Moreover, why did Foster's character not continue to study the same source, rather than building new dishes to help her start all over from scratch?There are also BIG problems over the setting of the events. The repeated and very irritating intrusion of the smirking visage of Bill Clinton as president puts it back then. As does the featuring of Mir. But we keep seeing a vertical take off passenger jet which only exists as an aeroplane designers fantasy. Even the V22 Osprey, the nearest thing to it in reality, is powered by giant propellers. So when is it supposed to take place?The acting is superb. such as when Foster sees Skerrit die ( after nearly saving his life ) and wordlessly expresses the impression of guilty sorrow for having hated him. Or was she really thinking how lucky she was that it wasn't her blown up? The camera dwells on her at some length and one is forced to wonder. It is a poignant moment.Undoubtedly, for me, by far and away the best thing in the movie is when Foster must enter the machine and pauses to look down. Two helmetted, uniformed technicians like figures from some kind of psycho drama wordlessly looking on. The realisation of the machine is very well done, carrying with it a sense of frightening power and the awesome immensity of the engineering forces at work. I am reminded of seeing steam locomotives when I was a small child. The approach to the capsule really creates a sense of the loneliness of Foster-characters next few steps, augmented by the foreigness of the Japanese attendants whose only communication is a miniscule, fleeting nod.The one big question the movie leaves one with is this: Why didn't they simply build the machine again and find out what it leads to?",Contact
219,sam_3,Carl Sagan Managed to get his message through,10,15 May 2002,"Originally a novel by Carl Sagan, an astronomer/philosopher, this film is a theological monologue (seeking to be a dialogue) in a manner of science fiction.  At the surface, this is a story about an astronomer Arroway who seeks for intelligence out in space.  She receives a message, which she decodes, and following the message, manages to build a space-ship-like structure.  After overcoming a series of obstacles, she gets to ride on the ship.  Simultaneously, there's an intellectual/emotional relationship between a seminary drop-out minister Joss, who comfortably ""scores"" at the earliest stage of their acquaintance (no wonder he's dropped out of seminary).Underneath this narrative, we hear Sagan's attempt to reconcile Reason and Faith.  Arroway, who claims that mathematics is the only universal language, more or less represents ""reason"", whereas Joss represents ""faith"". 
On the one hand, we see the capricious side of religion, but then we are forced to admit that over 90 % of us belong to them.  In fact, you are not representative of humanity if you deny any ""greater being"".  We also hear Sagan when Joss says that it's not science or technology that corrupts humanity.  It's the incapability of humanity to handle them rightfully.  In other words, Sagan cries out and says, ""Religion is not against Reason per se.  Religion is sceptical of humanity which so repeatedly fails to handle Reason properly.""Until Arroway returns from the ""space trip"", she is far more convincing than Joss (i.e. we are led to be in favor of reason than faith).  The counter-balance takes place after she returns.  Her ""report"" is nothing but a ""sharing of testimony"" in an evangelical meeting (if you've ever attended one).  But this film does not give ""faith"" the victory, rather attempts to show both sides reaching out for each other.  Very post-modern.You can enjoy it either as a SF film or as a philosophical article which seeks for your response.

It moved me in ways that few movies have, and in ways that are very difficult to put into words... I think it is the best science fiction movie I have ever seen, with ""Blade Runner"" a close second.This film so intelligently illuminates so many facets of the human condition on this planet. In one sense anyone watching this movie could become very cynical about the hypocrisy, corruption, self indulgent and self destructive nature of humanity. But while conveying this, the film also highlights what is great and special about the human race, and in subtle ways gives the viewer a deep seated sense of hope for the future. It also reminds us, that in the scope of the vastness of the universe, in the ""big picture"" our petty struggles here on planet earth really matter very little at all.The film also contains one of the most intelligent and unbiased looks at subjects of religious faith and spirituality, with far more depth and insight than I can recall experiencing in any other movie.Beyond all this, ""Contact"" is also a grand tale of adventure, of the first journey into a completely unknown frontier.The acting is largely flawless, and the special effects were certainly adequate not to detract in any way from the magic of the film, even though by 2011 standards they might look a bit dated.I know not all are as moved by this film as I was.

I enjoyed the film for it's realistic portrayal of a science-fiction scenario. Only my personal gripe is that it should have continued with that portrayal. The movie feels like it took a sharp turn at the end. It reveals too much and is too visually explosive that it stands in stark contrast with the entirety of the film.It would have been better if it kept the same tone and atmosphere. Yet I was still entertained nonetheless. Moreover, the theme of science against religion is interesting as not many mediums have attempted to do that in a science-fiction genre.

My estimation of this movie is that while they only modestly follow the plot (The Message, The Machine, The Galaxy) and highlight only the key story points, the screenwriter and director actually captured the 'essence' of the book. So much that I'm certain that if Carl Sagan had been alive for the final edit, the 'For Carl' at the end of the film would have been welcomed by the author.The book is 431 pages of small font, extremely deep material. Yet Robert Zemeckis, Carl Sagan, Ann Druyan, James V. Hart, and Michael Goldenberg constructed a movie that tells a similar story that can be understood by all that spend the time to understand it. Regarding the book and movie differences. Did they change the number of people to travel in the machine? Yes. Did they change the political climate? Yes. Did they slightly demonize and trivialize Drummond, while making Ellie appear a little more sympathetic? Yes. Was Palmer Joss' role increased? Yes. Was the full journey described? No, but close.So what. My only real complaint is the 'pi' storyline omission, but they covered their bases with the final scene between Angela Bassett and James Woods (great character performances, by the way). I almost never see an adaptation of a book that lives up to the brilliance of the source material, but this one does.

229,jason-210,"The best Science Fiction movie since ""2001: A Space Odyssey""",9,10 April 2005,"This movie reminds us how superb Science Fiction can be when done properly. It belongs in the same league as a handful of SF classics such as Kubricks 2001: A Space Odyssey.This is an intelligent and convincing story that for once pleases the science buffs as well as the mass audiences. The script is intelligent and thought provoking. The movie does not rely on seducing the viewer with special effects, as so many do these days. Excellent performance from Jodi Foster as the dedicated scientist who believes in her work. John Hurt's Haddon is simply superb. However, I found Matthew McConaughey's character Palmer Joss unconvincing and the fact that he finds his way into the Whitehouse struck me implausible. Tom Skerrit's character ""Drumlin"" was also weak and stereotyped. The rest of the performances were OK, and it's even got Bill Clinton in it playing himself!!!The message of this movie is interesting, and gives it a philosophical dimension: That there is a uncrossable gulf between the mind that can only accept empiricism as reality, and the mind that can knows that subjective experience can be just as real. Jodi Foster's character is given an experience comparable to a subjective experience that is quite real but which she cannot share or prove, and through this she is able to finally understand that there may be something in spiritual reality after all.In summary, I'd say this movie is as a good a science fiction film as you're going to get.",Contact

People may get different result from the movie though. But, to take science as 'fact' is a big faith as well.The movie borrowed the shell of a science movie up until 3/4 of the length. In the last part, when we couldn't show what we 'feel' and 'see', others would have to take it by faith.This movie is not a pure faith movie, in that it still gives the loop hole that something left in proving the unproved jounery.Anyhow, this is a good movie that let people to think and feel.",Contact

I got the impression that it was an equal minded, and very reserved look at the religious and ethical qualities of a contact situation. Too reserved, in my opinion. When I heard the movie had something to do with god, I definately hopeed it would be more controversal than it was. Certainly it started us thinking about religion, and sparked some conversations, but it wasn't a very big spark. They tackled a very important subject, but in my opinion, not nearly hard enough.

239,Twillhead,See It! With Some Admonitions (Sorry!),8,18 October 2003,"'Contact' is arguably a fine film, the real star being the superb photography and special effects, with a jaw-dropping opening sequence that runs 3 and ½ minutes long and astonishingly, magnificently sets the tone for the rest of the picture. I was also intrigued by the film's handling of science and faith (read: NOT ""religion""), and the interesting juxtaposition of both by film's end. The first climax of the film, in which Jodie Foster as the brilliant Ellie Arroway makes an incredible journey, is eerily, achingly beautiful, followed quickly by the second climax of the film, Ellie's disquieting but deeply-felt epiphany. To say any more would ruin the story for those who have yet to see the movie. That said, Foster's performance was uncharacteristically out of focus  she utilized one too many of her stock-in-trade 'pained and confused' facial expressions that read (at least to me) as if the character was constantly vacillating her position inside of her head, an attribute Ellie would decidedly not possess. Her gaze should have been straight-forward, determined, and unwavering. Matthew McConaughey as Palmer Joss was sincere but a little bit too hunky to be believable. A character bestowed with such a spectacular name would have been much more realistic if he had been played with the plain ambiguity of William H. Macy. Of course that would undermine the obligatory sexual tension and negate the fatuous 'romance,' a plot point that adds absolutely zilch to the story. Since the film indicates from the very start that it is in possession of a serious-minded agenda, I can only guess the producers felt the romance was either necessary to establish the frailty and humanity of Ellie, or, more likely, as a form of selling out, a pandering affect to draw in a larger audience. Stock characters rounding out the film, portrayed by Tom Skerritt, James Woods, David Morse, and William Fichtner (and a teeny-weeny role by Rob Lowe), are solid and well-done. **SMALL SPOILER** The character of S. R. Hadden, played with straight-faced solemnity by John Hurt, might have looked good on paper, but comes off as unintentionally, embarrassingly hilarious. As the obscenely wealthy benefactor who assists Ellie in her quest, he is first seen in his private jet, which he keeps in constant flight, presumably landing only to refuel before soaring off again (okay, I can suspend my disbelief long enough to buy that). But when next Hadden contacts Ellie, it is, unbelievably, ridiculously, from aboard the space station Mir -- the gentleman is now apparently cancer-ridden and prolonging his now-tenuous life in outer space. Nothing else in the entire film stretches credulity more than this; it is shocking in its absurdity. **END SPOILER** After all is said and done, I gave 'Contact' 8 out of 10 points.

Ever since, she's wanted to know just who or what is out there. She begs for research funds and time slots on radio telescopes, hoping to detect some message from space.She meets a young religious leader, Palmer Joss, who has wondered about the same questions. He found his answers in God; while Ellie, dissatisfied with that, keeps looking for scientific answers. They have a close but questioning relationship, symbolizing how scientific cosmology and religion may be driven by similar impulses but come up with different answers.Suddenly an alien message from space is received on Ellie's radio telescopes. Washington DC tasks Ellie with the job of decoding the message. That starts Ellie on a path of learning and discovery of which she could never have dreamed.

Contact is a fantastic film, one of hope, light, dreams, and serious sociopolitical commentary. I find that after we have shed ourselves of the previous administration and its relentless pollution of the State with the Church, xenophobia, hoarding, and fiscal elitism, one underlying lesson in the film never rests: Fundamentalism of any kind is dangerous to progress of all kinds. The tantalizing science fiction story (please read the book) can't fail to bring both hope and frustration to the viewer. Some of us hope that such prescient and nurturing civilizations exist to perhaps one day enlighten our own. We seethe when backward forces within resist such notions for their own narrow beliefs and benefits. Contact delivers this dichotomy of chaos and control in a perfect way, leaving us at the end much like we were at the beginning, unable to truly affect change except in ourselves and our own beliefs. You walk away from the film either elevated, or perhaps cheated due to lack of aliens and explosions. I wonder if the best audiences are those who hunger for command and control, guns n' ammo, fear and familiarity. Those viewers might just gain a kernel of hope somewhere in their psyche by watching Contact. The rest of us can appreciate that Sagan, somewhere out there in his Ship of the Mind, embraced and found comfort in the enormity of our universe and how tiny we actually are.

253,Aldri7,some flaws,7,11 June 2012,"Contact is a movie I have seen many times, and through it all, I have learned to sort of ignore all of the irritating, poorly cast male characters and focus on the big picture - the movie's positive message, the sophisticated plot and the often stunning visuals. So its always been a mixed bag for me and another case of Hollywood transforming a book into something that would probably shock the original author. Contact may have been a book written by Carl Sagan, but the movie is all Jodie Foster. And as a vehicle for Jodie, it was well conceived. But Jodie's incredibly strong on screen persona is not easy for everyone to digest. And worst of all, it tends to rubs off on everyone else that is cast to play along side of her here.Anyway, Jodie is Dr Ellie Arroway, a brilliant, lonely, obsessed and tempestuous astrophysicist. Since the death of her Dad when she was a youngster, there has been a big wormhole sized hole in her world, and she attempts to fill it by searching for life on other planets. This very personal story is then weaved together with an intergalactic one involving not only all of humankind but otherworldly beings as well when she succeeds in making first contact with aliens from the Vega star system. They want to say hello and send down a taxi (which we must build ourselves) to ferry some lucky individual to the center of the galaxy for a rendezvous with......God? Anyway, only one person gets to go, which, although it makes no sense from a practical point of view, fits well with the movie's theme which is an exploration of one woman's very personal, spiritual journey. One very bright but socially inept young woman.OK, now perhaps because those that wrote the screenplay knew that Jodie's personality would not go down easily with everyone, they actually wrote jokes about her confrontational, ""pain in the ass"" style right into the script. That way you were at least told up front what to expect and it was OK - Dr Arroway is a seething mass of conflicting emotions, veiled and not so veiled hostilities, and childlike obsessions that often go beyond normal logic or reasoning. She doesn't always get along with others, particularly men, and particularly anyone that tries to control her. Instinctively, every male to her is either a loving father figure or someone just trying to jerk her around. Well, predictably, I guess, this is why all of the male's cast here are either jerks or Dads. Or sometimes both :) But does this make for enjoyable movie viewing? No, most of the time it doesn't. Not when you have actors like Tom Skerrit and James Woods cast in painfully confrontational roles and given incredibly lame scripts, playing jerks opposite Jodie. And neither does it work for me regarding Ellie's blind friend Kent, who I found irritating. But I reserve most of my scorn for Ellie's love interest, Palmer Joss (Played by Mathew McConaughey), who somehow manages to combine jerk/leering/frat boy with godlike/father/saintliness, and does it with a straight face. I mean, WTF? Who is kidding who? Well, Ellie seems to be attracted to both sides of this chameleon, though. I mean, it took lines like ""that must really chap his ass"" to get her attention initially, but down the line, she also bows down to ""you could call me a man of the cloth"", as if, by now balancing the ticket, she just might have found herself her perfect man? I don't know, but Palmer's White House ""Spiritual adviser"" connections are ludicrous. Couldn't they have cast someone less of a hunk for this role? Someone more cerebral? Jeff Bridges, perhaps?Anyway, I no longer laugh out loud at these sillier casting perplexities, and enjoy the movie for its originality plot-wise and for the science, the mystery and the journey into space. This is where Jodie is most at home anyway, not in the social arena. And ditto myself when viewing this movie. There is much to enjoy. A cool space transporter powered by strange technology that looks like a giant atom. A message from space that must be decoded. And without writing a spoiler here, I must say there are some unexpected plot twists along the way that will entertain. But ultimately, what it comes down to is Jodie and her relationship with all of these men, both the jerks and the dad's. Jodie frets and glares at the jerks. But in the presence of the Dad's she is soft, vulnerable, feminine and childlike in awe. I kind of find this to be a little disquieting, as though she never grew up, never accepted her place in the world amongst all of her peers. Maybe her journey, though and the fulfillment of her spiritual quest will settle her down. I think that knowing that might be a relief to us film goers, anyway. Knowing that Ellie Arroway, if she were ever to resurface in a sequel, would be a little mellower and forgiving towards those of us less Godlike than dear old Dad. And then maybe the jerks would disappear too...",Contact

Through a series of contact ranging from Morse Code to advanced instructions for how to build a spacecraft designed to reach the unthinkably distant system Vega, Arroway, a calculating scientist, misses her chance at exploration the first time around when she reveals her agnosticism to a panel deciding who will man the one-man craft destined for Vega.When the first iteration of the spacecraft malfunctions, wiping out a woman-slighting, opportunistic loser, a private investor gives Ellie her shot at the trip. In Vega, Ellie encounters a simulation of her father, who explains the gradual process of contact for galaxies across the universe.When she returns, her whole trip is thrown into question, as it appeared that she had not even left the launch deck.

263,gheremond,The definitive film on what a true encounter with an alien civilization could be like,10,18 August 2015,"Contact was one of the books I kept dreaming about being turned into a movie. The tone, the scope, the ambition of the material really begged for a big screen treatment. I was more than happy back in the day when I learned Robert Zemeckis, after his critical and commercial triumph with Forrest Gump, was preparing to bring Contact to life. And boy, did he deliver...The first thing that needs to be clarified is that this isn't a faithful adaptation of the book. Zemeckis and his screenwriters departed significantly in several occasions, but Carl Sagan was part of the production and this was very significant in keeping the spirit and tone of the book intact, even if the events aren't identical. The presence of James V. Hart also did help a lot. He did phenomenal script work on Hook and Dracula and I am sure he was very valuable here too. Would it be even better if they had sticked to the book 100%? Perhaps, although the film as it stands is so damn good, there is really not much room for improvement. This is one of the rare occasions (singular?) where I don't mind the changes. The truth is, the movie would probably have to be like 4+ hours long if they tried to incorporate everything, like the 5 passengers of the Machine, the cold-war setup, Hadden's extended presence and influence and the entire back story with Ellie's family (or prime numbers). It is hard even to start enumerating the number of subjects this film addresses over its densely packed 150 minutes. Science and religion and the role of each in our lives (including their conflicts), alienation, loneliness, scientific curiosity, ambition, integrity, perseverance, animosity, mistrust, the fear of the unknown and the urge to go where no man has gone before are only some of the issues dealt with and as you can understand, there is some pretty heavy material to digest. What should be stressed though is that Contact manages to communicate the optimism and awe that was such a central part of Sagan's book. As such, it is both an intellectual as well as an emotional ride. The film opens with a seminal scene, the camera zooming out of earth orbit with nothing but radio signals as audio track, gradually moving from deafening noise into deafening silence as earth becomes a pale blue dot in interstellar space, earth's radio signals being left far behind, with the camera eventually leaving the galaxy and moving towards the edge of the known universe. You realize right from the beginning, this journey will take you into uncharted territory. Just like in Forrest Gump, Zemeckis manages to take what is essentially a personal story and present it in an epic scale, crafting a film that spans years, continents and star systems. The scope and ambition of the book is all there and in several instances, immensely amplified. A typical example is the case of the Machine, which unlike the book, involves a truly gigantic superstructure. The sabotage of the first Machine turns out to be a jaw dropping sequence, one of the best destruction scenes ever put on film and the emotional impact of it and it's aftermath is simply amazing. Similarly, the climactic scene in Hokaido, where the Machine is revealed in its full grandeur is up there in its frenetic energy and immaculate editing with the launching sequence of Apollo 13. When the wormhole within the core opens, it sucks in clouds and sea and sky... just perfect. We were all ecstatic the first time the Stargate opened and Daniel went through it, but that was nothing compared to how the wormhole travel is portrayed in Contact, giving us imagery that has never been topped ever since (just take a look at Interstellar, which did a much poorer job in the same field almost 2 full decades later). I know most people were drooling over Titanic at the time for the special effects, but this is my vote for 1997's best.There are so many things that deserve praise in this film. In terms of acting, Jodie Foster is giving her career's best and her personal investment in this movie is palpable, I cannot think of another actress of the period more suited to bring Ellie to life. There are several quiet, introspective moments throughout that depend on her presence alone and Foster absolutely nails it. The great John Hurt is also marvelous as the recluse and enigmatic Hadden, turning scenes that could have been boring exposition into something pulled out of a thriller (like the revelation of the second Machine. If this doesn't bring you goosebumps, check your pulse asap). McConaughey is also doing work that would eventually take him about 2 decades to top. On a production level, the same team that worked on Forrest Gump essentially returns for Contact too, with great cinematography from Don Burgess and amazing production designs by Ed Verreaux. And Alan Silvestri composed yet another classic.Contact is perhaps the best (and most realistic) treatment to date of a possible encounter with an alien civilization and one of Zemeckis's best. t is required viewing for anyone with even a cursory interest in sci-fi. And don't forget to check out Starman for a different (but equally satisfying) take on the subject.",Contact

But that aside, it is an excellent and well-made movie, containing action (near the end), romance (here and there), suspense, mystery, betrayal. Everything but war is included. Yet it flows smoothly despite this, and the two and a half hours whisk by, at least to me.Perhaps I'm biased; I first saw this movie when it first came out in '97, when I was 11, and it has been a family favourite ever since. It was only when I saw it again recently that I realized how amazing of a movie it is.Jodie Foster, as usual, does an amazing job, stealing the show when she needs to. The other actors are all worthy of mention, too. The special effects are very impressive, and so far they have withstood the test of time. The music, by Silvestri, is typically beautiful and fitting. The writing and dialogue are on the mark.I'm having trouble understanding why this film only has a 7.3 in here; its rating should be in the 8's, if I had my way. I'd recommend this film to everyone, and its tameness (rating wise) makes it largely appropriate for children.

268,shermanlazzar,Its very Hollywood but raises some interesting questions nonetheless,7,4 December 2007,"""Contact"" tackles a subject hard to make entertaining whilst retaining much intellectual credibility. I think anyone will admit, for this film to work you may have to temporarily place your cynicism aside and just go along for the ride. The central theme in this film is not to explore the scientific possibilities of time or space travel, but question of faith.The plot and acting itself is quite strong across the board. (Ellie) Jodie Foster gives a passionate performance, as the minority scientists with an unrelenting dream of making contact with another intelligence. McConaughey gives an adequate support role, as the contrasting personality to Foster, someone who believes in faith and in God. James Woods plays the typically cynical military officer. Finally, upon Ellie and her team receiving a convoluted message from intergalactic entity, a media frenzy ensues and ultimately the question of other life in the universe and other ethical consequences are explored. There is numerous cameo appearances from Hollywood celebrities which add to the authenticity of the film. As such this film does veer off and become cheesy and unrealistic at times, but I don't think the film could have worked if it hadn't.The film provides more questions than answers, and rightly so. Ultimately, whether you believe in God or science, ""Contact"" proposes that faith is required to believe in both. As science's criticism of religion has been the lack of empirical evidence, it is posed that empirical or tangible evidence is not the currency that makes something true. Science requires the belief in something which cannot be proved, just as religion does. What I took from this film is that we should tolerate each-other's beliefs, no matter how far-fetched they may be from our own perspective.Iroically, the film seems to set out proving the importance of making contact with an ET, but we learn that is more important to make contact with each-other.Worthwhile.",Contact

But I guess I'd say if it is just us... seems like an awful waste of space.Contact is a science-fiction film written by the late astronomer Carl Sagan. The title ""Contact"" refers to the main plot, in which the human race makes contact with intelligent extraterrestrial life for the first time. However, it has a double meaning, because the title also refers to the contact made between human beings, and how significant events can effect the dynamics between various groups of human beings.Contact is about Ellie Arroway, a brilliant astronomer who passionately supports the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence project, a passion which is not reciprocated by those around her. One day, after years and years of listening to various radio frequencies across the universe, she finally hears a signal coming from the star Vega. This signal is unmistakably intelligent, as it consists of every prime number between 1 and 101. Upon closer inspection, something even deeper is discovered about the message, and what follows is an account of how this message effects the human race, including the political, religious, and the economic ramifications.Carl Sagan was a staunch humanist, who believed strongly in the value of human ingenuity, and our potential to be accepted into a fictional galactic community which he wrote about often, consisting of the populations of extraterrestrial species on other star systems and planets. Contact most definitely incorporates all of these ideas, and is unmistakably Sagan in it's depth of inspiration, emotional content, and hope for humanity.This is a film that has always stayed with me; it's a deeply moving and profound piece of art that poses serious intellectual questions, but at the same time makes an argument that not everything can be rationalized, including life, love, faith, and the existence of God. At its core, the film is a study... a study of the interactions between human beings, and the methods human beings will utilize in order to make sense of their existence on this ""pale blue dot"" of ours, whether it be by science, religion, destruction, or love.It's not a perfect film, but it's one that has inspired me greatly; I wouldn't be the same without it.9/10",Contact

His plot is briefly ended when the government funding is removed and takes awhile before he can manage to get her back on track. But Hadden uses his powerful organization to manipulate Dr Arroway into finding his signal supposedly from the star Vega this signal just happens to be almost exactly what would be expected from some off world intelligence.When the code he makes up becomes bogged down in translation he provides the clue for its decoding and the government is off to the races. Seems it is the plans for some mysterious machine that ends up costing 1/2 Trillion dollars. But its not just that, seems that most of the money spent goes to subcontractors or wholly owned subsidiaries of Hadden enterprises. Mind you he is dying of some cancer and this is his way to get back at all human society.There is never going to be anyone but Arroway in the machine (his patsy) and when someone else is selected Hadden manages to get the first machine destroyed and Dr. Arroway goes to the systems test site in Japan with one more Hadden industry subcontractor which has another complete machine ready to go.

Arraway suggests that God cannot be proven and Joss comes back and demands she prove she loves her father, but never gets the chance to do it due to being taken away with some new issue. Leaving any argument she might offer unsaid.And in the end when confronting the senate investigating committee, Arraway is essentially forced to admit she only has her own private experience and nothing else as proof of her 18 hour long experience.The word ""faith"" never appears in the dialogue, but it is in fact a central theme of this movie.

275,DanielStephens1988,The Power Of First Person Experience,10,19 December 2019,"Most people would deny that science tells us to ignore our perceptions, and yet that's precisely what science does. Science is almost predicated upon the rejection of first-person phenomena. For example, if you tell a scientist that you had a mystical experience, what's he going to do? He's going to dismiss that, and say, ""They're just feelings. You're just hallucinating"". Science rejects the subjective, which is the only thing that exists, and the only thing science could be predicated upon. But because science is in denial about it, it has to repress that, projected outwards. Science demonizes religious groups, non-rationalists, hippies, mystics, and philosophy because that's inherent to the enterprise of modern science. To be a modern scientist, you have to ignore perceptions to be a great scientist. You have to be completely absorbed and lost within concepts within your imagination to create scientific theories. The scientific methods are imagination concepts, they're not perceptions. You don't perceive gravity, you invent gravity with your mind as a concept, and then you formalize it using equations. Then you have to convince yourself that all of those equations and maps that you made are real. That they are out there in the world, that you didn't actually create them, that they're more real than your first-person experience of life. What you imagine in all your concepts and theories is objective, and what you actually feel and experience is all the flaky stuff. This is all the subjective stuff. 'Contact' explores the unknown and how science is only coming from a finite perspective, and will never fully understand reality. Moreover, it allows us to respect religion, and science and how both are searching for the same thing.",Contact

The acting is great, especially with Jodie Foster.  The special effects are not really that wowing and they are not meant to be, it is supposed to be realistic, and they achieved their goal.  As a fan of Carl Sagan, I think this movie did justice for him, although he did not live to see it.The acting is very strong, especially with Jodie Foster.

Foster probably couldn't go through with it, and you can't blame her for not wanting there to be a record of it on film.....

However in order to present this message the filmmakers have created a film that is neither a clever sci-fi movie about how contact with an extraterrestrial race might occur on our planet earth circa 1995 or a more childish awe inspiring fantasy flick, but somewhere in-between.The first half of the movie is a character study of the movie's main character; a scientist obsessed with confirming that there's intelligent life out there thats been burning inside since she was a kid in part due to the loss of her parents. This is interesting, if a shade slow, but sets up many plot part and flaws in the character that need to be overcome.The second half of the movie having received contact comprises the rapid constriction of a a machine built on alien blueprints and then the use of the machine by the protagonist to make contact.My main problem is that the movie is trying to tell us that this could happen; they even use multiple scenes with footage of Bill Clinton to reinforce that this has footing in OUR reality, its earth, it's 1995ish.Most sci-fi movies have crazy and wonderful idea but as a viewer you have to be able to accept that its possible even if thats only in the world the film exist in. And this principle answers most movies.One of the themes used in the movie is that the most likely explanation is most likely the truth using a scientific principle to explain this.So when i think of first contact with an alien race, do i think that say - alien machines being hidden under ground for thousands of years which wake up and kill everyone being more likely than a basic signal being transmitted through light years of space that could be decoded in days as a blueprint to create a gigantic machine, which the human race were able to them comprehend and build in what seemed days, not knowing what it would do, but knowing how to use it, then select a research scientist to man the machine and this all happens in the earth we know in the mid 90's? i think you can guess.Most people that have an issue with the film cite the pointless end scenes of court room drama, the withhold information that the cameras recording 18 hours of static confirming that she did experience contact, but for me its just the ridiculousness of how we got there.So for me the story is ok, it's well made and the acting is great, i just think had it been based on a different reality of earth with a bit more ridiculousness throughout creating amore child friendly awe inspiring movie rather than 2 very separate halves it would have been a more palatable/believable movie.",Contact

281,aussiemiguel,No words for Jodie's performance.,10,21 October 1999,"There are no words to express how Contact makes me feel.When I first saw this movie, I thought it would be a predictable moral fable. But it became one of my all time favorites. Contact is not a story about alien invaders. It's true that it features amazing special FXs. But most of alll, it's a story that touches your soul and makes you think about faith and science. This comment may contain some spoilers, so be warned. It's a complex portrait of contemporary society, our obsesions, our fears.
If you start thinking what would happen to us if we got a sign from an alien life form, it wouldn't be very different from Contact.The fear of facing the unknown, the need of holding to old traditions and religion (in a fundamentalist way), it would all be confusing and controversial. The destruction of the first machine is breathtaking, it's like you lose all your faith in mankind. How can governments and people be so stupid and intolerant? If we can't trust ourselves, how could we ever trust an extraterrestrial intelligence?Jodie Foster should have got the Academy Award for her performance.She became Ellie Arroway, her despair, her amusement, it was all real.When she tries to convince an skeptic audience that her experience was real, she made me cry.Would you believe Dr. Arroway's story? Would you have faith in her words? I believe in them. I believe, as Ellie said, that if we're alone in the universe, it would be a waste of space.",Contact
282,michellangelof,More than meets the eye.,10,2 January 2019,"When Contact was released, a friend shared his opinion complaining that ""there was no action and we never saw an alien"". For some reason, maybe even that one, I didn't watched it then. Years later, another friend recommended it to me. By then I had read a couple of Sagan's books, and many of my ideas about religion and science had changed profoundly.I saw CONTACT and began to understand that all that history of extraterrestrials coming into contact with humans was just one part of it or an excuse for the rest. At that point, by the way, the film remains somehow unresolved, and what bothered several people is nothing more than consistency in Carl Sagan's position of promoting science without contaminating it with whatever his personal opinion or 'belief' was. I still thank for it.CONTACT was Sagan's only novel, and although the film, for understandable reasons such as avoiding too many characters or being longer than commercially acceptable, is not identical to the book, I think what mattered is still there. I understand that Sagan approved the film before he died and it probably wasn't just technical merits or performances but the main ideas remained.CONTACT talks about human nature, the search for truth, loneliness, how feelings humanize us and how the most honest scientist can also fail in his objectivity when they (the feelings) get in the way. It also talks about intellectual honesty and what this can lead to. No concept there is a deep truth or out of reach and that's also something I like about it.Eleanor Arroway is a great character and Jodie Foster is the perfect choice for playing it.It's not a regular comercial film, but it's serious, it talks about us humans and can be enjoyed a lot, as I know.

283,Jay-Kavanaugh,Inside this mess is an excellent film struggling to get out,7,21 November 2005,"My expectations for this film were very high. I'm a sci-fi fan and it recently made a top ten list of sci-fi films. In the end I found it a mixture of excellence and drivel. The excellence includes Jodie Foster, always good value and she doesn't disappoint here. The plot is first rate too. Not completely original, being loosely based on 'This Island Earth' but takes it in a new and interesting direction.So the film obviously started on the right track but then the makers went down to their local 'film-scripts-R-us' where they spent approximately £1.50 and the result was worth every penny. The first 30 minutes of the film is totally irrelevant. I found one very small event that had something to do with the main plot but you would miss even that if you blinked. The middle part of the film is a series of unconnected sub-plots that leave you wondering when the main feature is going to start. We also have the Hollywood Standard Romance (TM) bolted on the side which clutters an already cluttered film. The result of all this is a film that feels way too artificial and I didn't get any feeling of involvement.The mystery and action when it did eventually start was crammed into the last part of the film and left more questions than it answered. There seems to be a fairly significant plot hole as well. Not wishing to give anything away but consider the message that was sent and then the explanation of it later on. Doesn't add up.Yet somehow in all this chaos is a really original idea. I just wish the makers would have had a bit more courage to make more of it.",Contact

I have a weak spot a mile wide. I can ignore massive plot flaws and bad acting, for just a taste of what mankind might become in the future, or what he might see in the future.And I admit, when I started watching, I was again captivated. A movie about first contact, and about human travel among the galaxies, and the massive complex machine that would take them there. I will tell you - the machine itself is a marvel. It was an amazing effect. The science, at least early on in this movie, is fine. Not amazing, but better than Hollywood's average.But throughout the whole movie, the intertwining of religion and science are clumsily handled. Ridiculous soliloquies are given by the religious right, and equally clumsy rebuttals by the scientists.

Okay, one more question. We see Bill Clinton in power when The Message is first discovered. The man is still in power when Ellie takes the trip through The Machine. So i figure only a short time passed between these two events, at least not more than a few years (unless Bill found a loop in the U.S. Constitution). So are we to believe that humanity was able to figure out all this new science packed in the message and build a trillion dollar machine in such a short time? That's quite a leap.

290,octomancer,Flawed but truthful and thought provoking,9,31 March 2005,"I rate this 9 out of 10. Matthew McConaughey is the minus 1. In time I may assess his performance differently. I like Parker as a character, but it could have been cast better.There is so much to see and enjoy in this film. Ellie was traumatised by her father's death, he was a loving father, they were very close. An only child, she was deprived from an early age of close human CONTACT. Ellie's obsession with SETI is easily understood.I love the juxtaposition of science and religion, oops, sorry, SPIRITUALITY in the film, as played out in the characters of Ellie and Joss (Foster and McConaughey). There is always some antagonism throughout the film between the two, sometimes between the principals, sometimes between ancillary characters, but there is sympathy too. Kent (Fichtner) is present when Ellie travels because of ""a higher power"" McConaughey). When she, the hardened empiricist, has a deeply spiritual experience, he is the only one to accept what she says at face value. But then again, Joss is the reason why she wasn't chosen first. Which leads me to ...Drumlin (Skerrit) and the religious nutter (Busey) both die. Why, in terms of the morality play subtext, isn't definite, at least not to me, but a first guess would be: Drumlin is too glib, he tells the selection panel ""exactly what they want to hear"", he is too political. Busey is too narrow minded, he cannot see beyond what he has always known, he refuses to grow, to evolve beyond our current condition, a major theme of the film. Both, in their own distinct ways, are off track.All through the film the contest between the scientific and the spiritual is played out. It is quite skillful in that it manages to pose questions without giving easy answers, we are left to ponder for ourselves.And then, on top of everything else, John Hurt as Drummond is a delight :-) ""The first rule of government spending: Why have one when you can have two at twice the price?"" A bit hammy, perhaps, but very enjoyable.On a final note, I'd like to say that I've only just watched this film for the third time, having seen it at the cinema the first time, eagerly anticipated. The first two times, I was extremely irritated by it, by McConaughey principally, but also by what I saw at the time to be the lame nature of the tension between science and spirituality. I'm a lot more sympathetic to the spiritual these days, and hence enjoyed Contact a lot more.I'm not surprised that the story is from a Carl Sagan book, rather than being formulaic Hollywood fare.",Contact
291,ModishMovies,Sloppy and Unengaging,4,25 February 2018,"After reading Roger Ebert's ""Great Movie"" review of this and hearing from others that it was the new 2001: A Space Odyssey, I had very high expectations for this film. While Roger Ebert's review was very well-written and many of his points were accurate, the film was a let-down and does not at all achieve the greatness that many have claimed it has.It has an interesting concept to begin with. A young girl fascinated by communication gets to use her passion to pursue something beyond Earth. The first part of the film and the set up is interesting and adequate, but the film crumbles in on itself when Matthew McConaughey's character is introduced and the film becomes sloppy, boring, and dumb. His character is supposed to contrast ideologically with Jodie Foster's Ellie Arroway. Since this is a PG-rated film and can't not be cliche, they naturally have to fall in love for a short time despite an astounding lack of emotional connection and interest in their ""relationship."" His character comes back later on in a dumb, un-creative, and annoying way just to add conflict and ""depth"" to the story/characters -- even though it doesn't. The story has its high points and it has its low points. It does manage -- at times -- to match 2001: A Space Odyssey's visual effects and intriguing concepts, but then returns to the human world and reverses any smart themes or messages back into the dumb ""faith vs. proof"" argument. The way that this message is executed is poor and takes away from the greater story of space exploration and contact with other-worldly beings. Instead of extending the story and creating a new aspect of debate and discussion, the film is distinctly divided between its religious/scientific message and its 2001-like grandness of space. Perhaps if this film went for a less realistic approach and focused more on the smart themes of space exploration while also exploring the psyche of its main character, it could have been considered a classic more on par with 2001: A Space Odyssey. In the end, I can't recommend this film because it ends up pandering to younger audiences by dumbing-down its themes and topics that alienates (pun intended) audiences in search of a smarter, more mature film. 2/5 stars.",Contact
292,Kubricksboy,Zemeckis's Very Best,9,14 August 2015,"Carl Sagan, a sensible man of science. That's what one might think of him after seeing his exceptional novel coming to life in Contact. Robert Zemeckis's love letter to mankind's search for extraterrestrial life is one of his best among many other greats and a very few menials. Sagan beautifully crafted story about the search for answers might not be a very thrilling film, but it is for sure the one you will rejoice.A young girl (Ellie) who show a great deal of interest in the fields of science and mathematics grows without the care of her parents, both of whom have died when she was very young. Ellie grows up to be what she had initially intended to be, a scientist dedicated to searching for extraterrestrial life. In this far-flung pursuit, she comes across many hurdles, but she never gives up on her dream and that finally pays off as she finds the signal she had been searching for. This signal after many days of work proves to be a way to Contact Extraterrestrials but like at any other time as Science rises Religion tries to bring it back to the ground to its wretched state. Despite these frail deeds, humanity makes Contact by sending Ellie to represent all of humanity, but of this Contact she does not have any proof and a race which never asked for the proof for God asks for proof of this historic journey into the cosmos. While Ellie happens to be the only person to witness this truly legendary moment in the history mankind, mankind itself starts to despise her, but she never tries to give away to their stubborn foolishness for she believes that she had had Contact set aside what the world is saying about it or her.A Dedication to Carl Sagan, Robert Zemeckis's Contact is a film which celebrates two of highly controversial emotions, Human Persistence, and Belief, he tries and succeeds at blending both of these emotions with high precision, allowing none of both to overpower each other. The Background score was not very enchanting but was suitable for the situations it was played in. The simplistic and yet beautiful cinematography of the film is like the one you can see in other Robert's greats. Matthew McConaughey performance among the many great ones was the one you will love most. The Science Fiction part of the film which Robert Zemeckis was crowned king for his Back to the Future trilogy looks more like possible science than impossible fiction which most movies try to sell.You should and will watch Contact if you for one love science as much as I do.

I didn't believe that someone as young as Palmer Ross would be appointed to take care of the ""religious"" part of the decision committee, especially since he isn't even ordained. I could've done without the Tom Skerrit character and the subplot of him winning and then dying. And it was very distracting and unnecessary to have Clinton in it.These are minor carps. And more than made up for by sequences showing that the first signal returned was Hitler. How chilling. Or the opening sequence which uses the powerful sound of complete silence.Those I've encouraged to see it were disappointed for the most part. There were no big climaxes or explosions or zooming spaceships with overlords in cool imposing costumes. Instead they had to endure emotions, philosophy, theology, and science. The concept of thinking during a movie turned them off. To them the definition of ""entertainment"" is to turn the brain off and forget the rest of the world for two hours.If this is your movie philosophy, you may prefer empty-headed but special-effects sci-fi extravaganzas like Independence Day.

The closest analogy I can think of, tipsy on a Saturday night, is a Bosch painting pretending to be 20th century photo-realism. So I come to the punch line: during my second run (ongoing) I noticed Jodie Foster's line (paraphrased) ""He (my father) died when I was nine."" Later, faced with the John Hurt character's incredibly pointless video-backed biography, we see her birth date as August 1964 and her father's death as November 1974.

298,Aptosblue,Contact - 20 Years Later,6,12 May 2016,"This will be my first review that contains spoilers because I don't believe I can say what I want to say without that tag. The idea of the movie is great, going through what it would be like to discover an alien signal for the first time is an intriguing idea. However the premise of the movie isn't what bothered me, it's more of what the movie was actually about.Contact begins very awkwardly, it tries to give you some sort of backstory on the main character and it my opinion it was completely unneeded. The story about her father dying should have been irrelevant to a story about aliens, right? The problem was, the movie isn't about aliens, it's about religion vs. science. You don't notice this at first, but it becomes painfully obvious after the first hour. Forgetting the first part ever happened, the next part of the story is quite entertaining. The scene where they are first getting the signal was incredible and the subsequent scenes of dissecting the code was just as good. Matthew McConaughey plays a religious man that is the love interest of Jodie Foster's character and from what I gather the producers decided to do this to play to audiences emotions, I guess? When you look at great sci-fi movies like Alien and The Thing, imagine if they had shoe-horned a romance in there, would they had still been great movies? To this day this kind of thinking in Hollywood exists, they feel as if they don't have a romance in their movie it would be incomplete which is ironic because the opposite is true in my opinion.The entire religious aspect of the movie was also unneeded. I am not a religious man, but the way they portrayed the religious people in this show was ridiculous. The LAST thing you would expect in a sci- fi movie is a heavy religious overtone. Looking at some plot-holes, why didn't they stock Ellie's capsule with food in case she was gone for a long time? No space suit either? It seems like these people are some of the most unprepared astronauts ever. Also Vega is 26 light years away, which is actually right next door to us, to think an alien civilization that is capable of opening wormholes doesn't utilize radio waves is a bit unbelievable. All things considered, it's a good movie with a ton of bloat. It could have easily have been 90 minutes long if they had cut out all of the things I mentioned above. It would have been an 8/10 if it hadn't of tried to give us a moral lesson.",Contact

Sagan had a friend at Cal-tech named Kip Throne who is a theoretical physicist who worked on wormholes and the nature of space and time whom consulted him on Contact. This movie was the #1 best astronomy movie according to Astronomy Magazine because it was a realistic depiction of contact with an alien civilization. Contact was very well written and deep, and I can totally relate to this movie. My favorite part was when Ellie went in the dodecahedron pod on that machine and traveled through wormholes and saw stars and galaxies and landed on a beach on a planet near the center of our galaxy where see saw an apparition of her father.

301,growe,Top marks,10,15 August 1999,"Contact is that rarity among films, and especially among sci-fi films: an Original Idea. It is a fusion of a novel written by a scientist (Carl Sagan) who devoted his entire life to the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence, and the dedication and genius of a film crew that lovingly transferred Sagan's visions to the big screen. The result is pure magic - anyone who watches this film and is not moved must be devoid of imagination. Besides being excellent science fiction (that could turn into science fact at any time), it is also a ruthlessly accurate depiction of the short-sightedness of government officials and mankind in general. Should contact of the sort described in the film ever occur, the various reactions of everyone from religious fanatics to the secret service are very likely to be exactly as shown in the film. This accuracy is no accident - as a scientist and lobbyist himself, Carl Sagan no doubt encountered all of these reactions in his own life. Besides being a fantastic story, Contact could also be viewed as a ""future documentary"".Truly one of the best films; no, not just that - the best *concepts* of the decade.",Contact
302,Chris-268,A truly masterful film,10,6 January 1999,"Contact is one of the best films I have ever seen.  I would strongly encourage anyone who sees this movie to also read Carl Sagan's novel.  While Sagan remains one of my heroes and one of the greatest popularizers of science, frankly Contact the novel was a disappointment.  Although the underlying story was brilliant, Sagan includes just a bit too much technical jargon even for someone with a background in astronomy.  However, reading the novel gives some much needed background and fills in a few gaps that the film leaves out.The best thing about Contact was Jodie Foster's performance.  Throughout the film she captures perfectly the essence of Ellie Arroway: a brave, sincere, lonely (but ever-optimistic), STRONG woman.  The scenes beginning from the launch of the Machine and ending with Arroway's return to Earth are some of the most well-acted scenes I have ever viewed. Foster's looks, her words and emotions, are more sincere than some people ever get in real life.  I weep openly every time I watch. Foster deserved an Oscar for her stellar performance, but to my knowledge she wasn't even nominated.  The rest of the characters in the movie aren't nearly as strong, but passable. Interestingly, in the novel Palmer Joss's character was more like the suicidal bomber, though not as extreme.  (I was really looking forward to seeing the huge tattoo of the Earth that Palmer Joss had on his chest, but I guess Matthew McConaghey said no!)Although not completely scientifically accurate, Contact was probably as close as Hollywood will ever come, apart from 2001: A Space Odyssey.  This film gives a really good glimpse inside the world of radio astronomy, and what SETI (The Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) has been doing for years.  In fact one of SETI's most prominent figures, Jill Tarter, noted that this movie was ""almost my life.""  If we ever do make contact with another intelligence in the Universe, it will probably happen the way it does in this film (advances in technology aside).  And to anyone who complained about the alien, please, just stick with Independence Day and the like from now on. Obviously the point of this film completely passed you by.Contact is a masterful vision of what we all hope for in life- to find some meaning. Whether it be through religion or science, Contact shows us that the two need not be in conflict. While this may be seen by some as a Hollywood sugar-coating of the issue, it heartens me to see the two sides reconciled.

James Woods plays the consummate a**hole, a role he plays quite well - in fact, there are points in this movie when you just feel the urge to yell at the screen, most of it unprintable. Matthew McConaughey does quite a good job, and his character is right on the mark... supportive and disbelieving at the same time. Each of them plays their roles in a way that is entirely believable... yet at the same time you want to question the role (not the actor, but the character). Skerrit also does a good job, limited though it is. They are believable *as the characters*... which is exactly what a movie is supposed to do.The camera work and the F/X are almost unbelievable... they are absolutely spectacular. While at one and the same time they portray the realities of life on Earth (the various satellite arrays, everyday rooms, council chambers), they also portray the wonders of the universe. One day we actually make it out there... only to find that Hollywood has beaten us to the point. Yet the Hollywood F/X don't leave us lost in a realm of... F/X; we can look at this (the star journeys, the systems, the arrays), and it looks real; or at least, real enough to be totally believable, which is the whole point of Hollywood.Yet as with any good movie, the special effects play second fiddle to the actors and the characters they play. You can have absolutely amazing  F/X, and yet have a bland and boring movie (such as ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture""). Here, the special effects - as beautiful as they are - definitely play second fiddle to the actors and their characters.With all of this, we can't forget the man behind the camera... Robert Zemeckis. He's brought us such slapstick broadsides as ""Ghostbusters"", but at the heart he is a filmmaker, a true director (not that ""Ghostbusters"" was false), and this movie shows it - he does an astonishing job, getting astounding performances out of his cast.The characters - based on the novel by scientist and philosopher Carl Sagan - are nothing less that miraculous... and oh-so-human. It's a very big round of applause to the various actors that you look at each of the characters and you can see where each one is coming from; whom they are supposed to be - that's what Hollywood is supposed to be like, and so rarely is. There are no fancy aliens in this; everybody is remarkable human. And very nicely done.A silly note: during the very beginning of the movie, when the camera view pulls out from Earth and into space, it's highly amusing that the words of (former President) Richard Nixon mix and blend with the theme to the ""Twilight Zone""...If you want to get into the metaphysical parts of the movie, it's solely about faith... faith in all its forms. It doesn't matter what you believe - this movie will probably represent your point of view. At the end, in front of the committee, we have one person asking Arroway (Foster) whether they should take everything on faith... which is especially ironic when you remember that one person (played by Jake Busey) has their own form of faith which destroys and kills... which faith do you believe? Or should we believe all of them? What is faith, other than an extreme belief in something which cannot be proven?In a final note - yes, this movie will make you think (if you have the brains to see outside your own narrow little world)... but in the end, it's the astonishing performances (mainly by Foster, but also by McConnaughey and Woods) that will pull you in.If you like anything other than hack-n-slash, then I'd highly recommend this movie to you... see it with an open mind, and perhaps it will make you *think*!If you've got even a little bit of openness in your mind, if you have ever asked ""Are we alone in the universe?"", then this movie will be quite satisfying... because it doesn't answer any of those questions; instead, it shows you how people - real people - deal with them. Very, very good.It's a mark of this movie that after watching it on DVD, you don't really care about all of the extras... the interviews, the director's comments - you've just seen the movie, which speaks for itself in every line; why spoil it with something else? But even as I say that, the director's (and others) comments on the second track are nice - hearing what they thought about this and that is a very interesting extra. Still, the movie itself - and Foster's excellent performance - is the real reason for buying this DVD.",Contact
304,Mr.Caca,Art from Hollywood? Finally!,10,5 February 1999,"This movie is art! I read Carl Sagan's book a couple years before the movie came out. The book is wonderful. There are a few differences, but overall they're both compatible with each other. Something that is unique about this film is that it splits the audience in half. 50% of the audience will hate it. Don't worry about them. These people didn't notice the suddle and artistic camera techniques. They came to this movie expecting to SEE aliens. So they were disappointed when they didn't see them with their eyes. The people that hate this movie generally like movies like ""Armageddon"" and Quentin Tarantino movies. They don't like movies that make them think.The other hlaf will generally like it a lot. Some will absolutely love it. These people like to leave the theater with their head full of interesting possibilities. This movie does make you think. Some would call it anti-religious. I read one review of it in a ""christian"" movie review magazine, which said it was damaging to a christian's faith. Why? Because it dares to examine science and religion together. This movie is about fact versus faith. This movie isn't anti-religious. The whole theme is: Faith is necessary because some of life's most important truths can't be proven. You could say that it's impossible to prove the existence of God. Personally, I don't think so. I think if you look at it logically, it's incredibly obvious that God exists.The music is great,the actors are all convincing and likable (except for a few, although their characters were written that way). Carl Sagan put a lot of thought and thoughtfulness into his creation, and it shines through in the movie version. He had a tremendous appreciation for the wonders of the Universe, and this movie embodies that. Whether you're devoutly religious or a hard skeptic, you'll walk out of the theater looking up and smiling. Personally, I don't think aliens exist, but it was still a good movie. THe people that hate this movie can have movies liek ""Armageddon"" and ""Godzilla"" for themselves. This is much better. You'll THINK!",Contact

If more people had them as role-models instead of sports-stars, actors and models the world would look a very different place, to the better.Sagan never took opposition to religion, he merely asked: if there is a creator, who created him? In this masterpiece he again leans towards that question with religion being portrayed by Matt M and science by Jodie Foster. Of course science is the main focus and i remember Sagan in his TV- series ""Cosmos"" often contemplating how a Non-Terrestial-Intelligence would contact us and that his conclusion was by mathematics, in this case prime numbers. This movie is great and has a message that speaks to many people: Have an open mind and be curious about the world and cosmos we live in, and that we are not alone in this universe.

306,hyperexcel,"brilliant, seminal, touching film",10,15 June 2003,"Contact was by and far cheated for any Oscar nominations in 1997.The adaptation of Carl Sagan's novel of the same name masterfully slimmed plot lines and complexities from the book into a beautifully cut work of intellect and heart.Jodie Foster, brilliant as always, works wonders as a freethinking astronomer searching for answers to her own life's meaning through seeking out intelligent life in the universe.The rest of the cast create Sagan's biting (and in no way completely impartial) cross-section of political and religious forces opposing Foster's imposed heroine efforts.  From Tom Skerrit's anti-villain Drumlin to Matt McConaughey's stellar Joss, to James Woods' scathingly funny Kitz and Angela Bassett's hotheaded White House staffer Constantine, everyone pulled their weight as an accurate representation of how the modern world would respond to such a thought-provoking event in history.Summed up, Contact is a debate on science versus faith that encompasses nearly every nuance of every shell on the topic, from religious viewpoints to scientific standards, to the very message the film tries to deliver: that ""in all our searching, the only thing we found to make the emptiness bearable is each other.""See this movie if you want to cry with comfort that you are not alone.",Contact

I should know...I've listened to them all.As far as the movie itself goes, it's an excellent journey with a minimal amount of Hollywood tripe.  It's a combination of a bunch of quests. Ellie's quest for her father, the quest for science, the question of AI, etc.The acting is very well done.  Jodie Foster pulls off a very convincing performance.  Also notable is James Woods, who pulls off the skeptical gov't personality perfectly; Tom Skerrit as Ellie's boss who consistently overshadows her makes you want to hate him; and in a small but memorable role, John Hurt acts like he's halfway in outer space already.I especially enjoyed the ending, which I won't give away here, but it's a bit emotional and does bring everything full circle.A great movie and a great DVD.",Contact

312,mj_jernigan,Good but also full of plot holes,8,15 July 2018,"This is the movie where scientists are smarter than God during most of the film but all of them turn into total idiots during the final scenes. I still like the movie a lot but the plot holes keep it from getting more stars -- and it probably doesn't deserve as many as I just now gave it.
No proof? Particularly, considering the type of scientist Dr. Arroway is, I give her a 0% chance that she would not have insisted on picking through all the static that her camera picked up during her journey. After all, isn't that what they did with the original signal? Pick through static trying to find meaning? Thus, it would have taken her more no more than a few moments to discover that she had 18 hours of static and that was proof enough of the alternate timeline.
Broken chair. The engineers would have tested that chair design over and over to see why it failed. They would have examined the broken materials for flaws and who knows what else. They would have examined the video for evidence of unusual stresses. They would have likely found no explanation for why it broke under the known forces... or how she got out of it and her armor so fast.
Occam's razor. The idea that Hadden was somehow brilliant and rich enough to pull this off as a hoax is ludicrous. He would have to be either a god himself to have done it single-handedly, or it would have taken thousands of people many years to pull it off. Conspiracies with too many people never stay secret. I don't know which is least plausible: designing a flawless giant machine (either untested or somehow hiding all the testing) loaded with new technology (such as a magically sealing door) that generates an amazing light and EM show; or somehow outmaneuvering all the radio telescopes on the planet with satellites (that no one bothered to look for) as the Earth rotates on its axis as well as orbiting the Sun (those would be some highly-maneuverable satellites) while broadcasting a fake signal in sync to anything looking at Vega. Occam's razor looks to be pointing away from Hadden to me.",Contact

Her performance is genuine and absolutely stunning--especially during the federal inquiry. She articulated so well her experience in the Machine Consortium.This movie was not made for entertainment value.  If you're wanting a classic sci-fi alien flick, you'll be disappointed.  The whole purpose of the film (and the book--long live Carl Sagan) is to portray what REALLY could happen if another intelligent life were to contact Earth.

316,abettertomorrow,"""For Carl""",10,30 March 2000,"Reading other peoples' reviews, I see a split 50/50 argument where one side loves the movie and the other hates it. I am not one bit surprised, due to the importance of the film, and I feel this is proof that Contact is one of the most powerful movies of the decade. Like the reaction from the civilians to the machine, a movie with this much heavy firepower is likely to get both loathing and praise from its viewers. I for one praise the film, for its toughness and sensitivity, symbolism and passion, and the fact that it is a rare science fiction film, a gem which was released in a time where scientific intelligence in film has become a nothing short of a joke as the wonder of the universe has been ignored and the mystery of alien life have become a neverending trail of movie villains.The film of course centers around the science vs. religion theme, the oldest and most frightening of all school debates. Instead of taking the more independent path the book takes, the film takes the more sensitive on the science vs. religion argument throughout the film by telling us that science and religion points to the same direction (the ""pursuit of truth"") but are misunderstood when studying the nature of their WAY of finding the truth (science uses evidence and answers, religion uses love faith). At the end of it all, the film lets us know that if science and religion stops colliding with each other and starts to combine and compliment each other (listen to Ellie's final words in her testament) the human race might achieve things we can only dream about now.A perfectly refreshing film, with lots to say, great acting and directing, sound and special effects.

317,jkchou,An absolutely marvelous film.,10,16 June 2000,"This is my favorite film of all time. This movie captures my heart so much because it makes me imagine what extraordinary experience will be the defining moment of my life. Imagine your life's goal coming true and you are the only person on the planet who will ever be able to savor that experience. An utterly incredible premise. What also fascinated me so much about this movie was how the concept of intelligent life on other planets never deteriorated to the special effect and explosion extravaganzas that almost always characterized films in this genre. Contact, thanks to the book written by Carl Sagan, was put together thoughtfully and intelligently. I also thought that Jodie Fosters character received a major boost in the movie, which made the plot incredibly complex, enormously deeper than what meets the eye. Many of the internal conflicts of her character were presented in the earlier parts of the movie and you have to pay attention and catch them to understand just how significant each scene was. Then you will appreciate how important Matthew McConnahey's character was. If you passively absorb the movie, you will not get much of it! And if you catch those ""cues,"" you will understand why they made the ending like that.Technically, I was totally blown away by the discovery sequence. I was also completely astonished by the entire second half of the film. The physics, the visuals, the editing were so well blended into the fabric of her transportation that I was stunned agasp.

Well, ""Contact""'s author Carl Sagan did...and this film doesn't betray at all his book's ""soul"". And how could it be different, when Robert Zemeckis is the director and the main role is in Jodie Foster's hands?Everything starts with a little girl (she has no longer her mother and is very fond of her father, a radio amateur), who really wants to communicate with someone farther away than the other coast of America. Guided by her father, according to whom ""if we were alone, it would be an awful waste of space"", Ellie dreams... It will take her a lifetime and her colleagues'despise to realize her dream and perceive a rhythmic sound coming from deep space... from that moment on her life will never be the same again. Her project will bluntly come on the scene and will be put, more and more, on a political and military plan; her discovery will also bring new troubles in her relationship with a theologian, ""reverend"" Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), which always has to bring to account the conflict between religion and science, faith and empirical evidence. While the film was proceeding, I couldn't help thinking that I was having a lot of fun. Jodie Foster is in her best shape since the ""Silence Of The Lambs"" days; Matthew McConaughey (even if, for the role, someone older would have been more suitable) shows that he isn't just the handsome guy coming from Texas with a nice smile; great performances from the supporting actors, James Woods, Angela Bassett, Tom Skerritt. Zemeckis'direction is respectful of the novel, intelligent and refined. And my advice for you is to listen Alan Silvestri's soundtrack... it's able to take you to the frontiers of the universe just by closing your eyes!My conclusions are: one of the best films of a great director and a wonderful actress.

Add to this a love story between our driven scientist and a fallen yet equally driven spiritualist and you have all the making of a mass of hokum that in lesser hands would go downhill faster than a Radio Flyer on Mount Everest.However, we are in the hands of Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Back To The Future) who masterfully weaves the framework drafted by Carl Sagan into a marvelous tapestry.Jodie Foster is Ellie Arroway, the driven scientist who needs empirical evidence for anything to exist in her world.  She's part of a SETI (Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) group about to have their funding pulled by Dr. David Drumland (Tom Skeritt), who at the film's open is the director of the National Science Foundation.  Arroway's childhood traumas and fascinations have fused to turn her into this driven force; she is a woman with a vision and she is not easily deterred.  Ellie briefly becomes involved with Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey), a man who nearly became a priest, but who admits that celebacy was a problem for him, which makes him no less devout as a messenger for God's word.What evolves is a story that explores the relationship between society, science, and religion.  Its characters, which could easily fall cartoonish in the wrong hands, are well-drawn and expertly directed by Zemeckis, who had some prior experience with 'toons and apparently was aware what to watch out for.Lest you think my opening was a criticism of Carl Sagan and Ann Dryan's screen story, it was not.  Sagan and Dryan provided a good story structure for screenwriters James Hart and Michael Goldenberg to build on.  Zemeckis, aided by Alan Silvestri's music, keeps it all in tune and doesn't provide us with pat answers, and yet keeps us interested.One of the more endearing qualities of this film is its true-to-life representation of what would happen in America should what happens to Ellie happens to us.

321,falster,I wanted to see aliens. I got something infinitely better.,10,26 October 2000,"Walking into the cinema, the only thing I wanted to see in this movie was their interpretation of alien life. Instead, I was greeted with an introduction that managed to encapture the insignificance of man, the beauty and majesty of the universe, be visually outstanding, and opened my mind to the countless ideas and issues explored over the next two hours. In this age of winning formulas, predictability, and instant satisfaction, this is one of the few movies that actually makes you stop to think for a while, and I loved it. Most probably what affected me the most was the clear and distinct effort to avoid certain cliches, and present the viewer with something different, and ultimately satisfying. Despite the numerous complaints on the ending (spoilers ahead), the fact that Ellie met with a simulation of her dad allowed the viewer to adsorb what was being said, and feel the suprise and awe which Ellie was experiencing, and as she breaks out into tears on his shoulder, we see humanity as a small, scared child lost in the universe just hoping that someone will hug us and say ""everything is all right"". If it had succumbed to typical hollywood, we would have undoubtedly been met with a slimy creature with telepathic powers, which would have completely ruined the movie. Instead, by not being presented with images, we are allowed to form ideas about other life, how they can be just as confused about our origins as we are, no matter how advanced, and in fact reach out to help others, and give them a glimpse of a larger world which everyone is ultimately a part of. While this movie does have its flaws, it has ultimately moved me in a way which no other has, inspiring me to read the book (which is also very highly recommended), and I never get sick of it no matter how many times I have watched it.

Although I am not an atheist like Sagan was, I truly love how intensely he brought the realities of what moves and motivates the inward emotions from both perspectives in this film.Faith is essentially what we are required to have as one who believes in a God or higher power. Most religions describe faith as a hope in that which is not seen which is true. Carl Sagan's Contact does such an amazing job of showing us what it is to have faith.Eleanor Arroway's character is a staunch atheist keeping her entire belief system upon empirical evidence. Her early life experiences brought her to understand that only that which we can actually see is real and that everything else is circumstantial.Eleanor becomes an Astrophysicist and pursues the S.E.T.I. (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) project which is losing a lot of steam at the point you are introduced to her career. On one of the project sites, she meets a failed preacher Palmer Joss who she finds very attractive the hit it off and they spend the night together.As they clearly don't see eye to eye with life's purposes they move along. At some point Eleanor and her S.E.T.I. team finds a signal from deep space which when deciphered provides instructions to construct what appears to be a transportation device.After funding is OK'ed to construct this massive and very expensive transportation device Elly is eventually the person who gets to go on this adventure to this mysterious other world or whatever it does, as no one knows. As Elly is sent through this transportation device her experience is that she travels several light years in only a few hours. She visits different solar systems and even goes down to the surface of one of the planets and speaks to these other worldly beings. Shortly after this she becomes unconscious and awakes the next day in a hospital on Earth.She is completely confused as she comes to realizing that everyone is explaining to her that the modular device which she was in through her entire experience simply fell directly through to the bottom of the transportation machine in a matter of a few seconds.Elly can't believe it she knows that the module capsule device she was in was thrust away faster than the speed of light and that she did indeed visit other worlds and solar systems. However, because everyone else only saw that the device fell directly through the machine they only believed that the device simply malfunctioned.Although the story is fictional it evaluates the ideas of faith a bit closer. Perhaps we grasp the understanding just a little stronger of what it is to have faith for those of us who can not or do not understand the concept.I for one do have faith in a higher power, many people I know do not understand it but that same higher power has many times revealed great things to me.",Contact

332,kaessner,Not so much a sci-fi flick as a spiritual journey.,8,31 August 2002,"This film is a borderline excellent movie. However, it has some simple plot elements which seem to be prevalent in most other movies of this sort. Then again, it has a few messages to which we as both rational thinkers and movie-goers should pay attention. The first is that of the existence of God. The movie shows how a traumatic experience could so well cause someone to lose faith in a higher being. Yet even if we don't believe in God, there are hints that He is trying to speak to us. This movie shows that very well. The other is that of science versus religion. We see both extremes in this movie, but we also see the logical middle-man. Matthew McConaughey's character makes a statement that both science and religion are aspiring to the same goal, which is the search for truth. Of course this movie cannot change the beliefs of either extreme, but it is something to think about. God and science can coexist. Palmer Joss is the proof in this case. Overall, this film has the conflict which will cause people to either love it or hate it. It is not meant to be a triller. It is supposed to be spiritual, like an M. Night Shyamalan film.

The 90s were kind of a weird time for movies and far too many relied on CG, overused like a crutch at the expense of any kind of story. At the time, I thought society was nearing the peak of what was possible through generated graphics. It's funny how things age, ironically it seems nothing ages worse than overdone effects (remember when Transformers looked amazing?). It's sad Carl Sagan wasn't able to cameo, but I think Contact was done with care and respect to it's source.

In the book, but left out of the movie, we find that God, or some creator, went a huge step farther than that and embedded a message inside the number Pi, if you calculate it out to the bazzilionth place!

341,drk150,Excellent mix of science and human nature with only one major flaw.,9,5 March 2007,"This adaptation of Carl Sagan's novel is one of the better science fiction movies of recent years, in part because it doesn't necessarily need to be viewed as a science fiction movie. I think this had a polarizing effect on audiences. People who just went to see a movie said ""wow, that was a great movie and made me think a little"", while people who went to see spaceships and aliens said ""I waited for two and a half ours to see an alien and it was her &@#% dad."" Contact is not a movie about radio telescopes, data encryption, aliens, spacecraft, or time travel, though all of these things are critical to the plot. Nor is it a movie about religion, despite the main character being hounded for her lack of belief in God. At its core, Contact is a movie about belief without proof, about the ability of human beings to draw strength from what they know to be true within themselves.Astronomer Dr. Eleanor Arroway (Jodie Foster) is led by her belief in scientific principles, as well as the untimely death of her parents, to doubt the existence of God. As a scientist, she simply cannot fathom the presence of an almighty being that can't be explained by scientific principles. Her counterpart, Palmer Joss (Matthew McConaughey) is a man of faith. He was made so by an experience during which he says he ""felt god"", and could not deny it, regardless of what anybody else believes. As such, Joss cannot envision a world without a God. This makes them seemingly polar opposites, which could be the setup for yet another boring ""opposites attract"" romantic subplot, but as the movie reveals, the two are actually very similar.In short, Dr. Arroway's search for extraterrestrial life becomes a success when she discovers a message sent by aliens containing instructions on how to build an interstellar transport device. Unfortunately, the device can house only one human, and Dr. Arroway's lack of belief in God leads the international selection committee to pass on her, feeling she does not effectively represent humanity. 95% of the world believes without hard evidence that a God exists, leaving Dr. Arroway as an outsider.During the process, however, we see that in some ways, Dr. Arroway indeed has more faith than the religious 95%. Where many suspect the alien plans of being malicious, Dr. Arroway remains resolute that the message was delivered in the language of science, and must therefore represent a desire to increase knowledge, not to conquer. She also exhibits faith in the design of the transport device itself. While others want to add safety devices not illustrated in the schematics, she has faith that the aliens' design is exact and should not be altered.After the first device is destroyed by terrorists, Dr. Arroway is chosen to go aboard a second device. Once onboard, she appears to fly through space, meet an alien and discuss humanity's place in the universe, and return home. During her trip, Dr. Arroway experiences a celestial event that is so beautiful she cannot describe it. She is moved to tears as she whispers that she has no words to describe it, that they should have sent a poet. This subtle moment entirely alters Dr. Arroway and her perception of the universe, as neither English, or her favorite language, science, can adequately describe the beauty of the event. This is Dr. Arroway's equivalent of Palmer Joss meeting God.However, from outside the vehicle, it appears that she never left Earth, since the vehicle was only out of contact for a split second. She has no evidence of her ""experience"", no artifacts brought back from distant stars, no photographs of aliens, nothing. Now the shoe is on the other foot. Dr. Arroway believes without physical proof that she went somewhere, but the world, and in particular the congressional committee called to investigate the mission, is skeptical and rejects her story. After the mission she is still an outsider, but the sides have been reversed. Before the mission, it was painful to watch Dr. Arroway being pushed aside because she does not believe, but after the mission it is even more painful to watch as she is asked to deny her belief, her truth, something which defines her as a person. However, we recognize that her belief in her experience is just the same as Joss' belief that he felt God, and this belief without proof forms a bond between the two. We are made to think about the invaluable nature of one's beliefs, whatever they may be, and just how central our idea of ""truth"" is to our existence.Now to the flaw I mentioned, which is the only reason I rate this film a 9 instead of a 10. It comes at the end, when Rachel Constantine and Micheal Kitz discuss the contents of Dr. Arroway's mission recorder. Dr. Arroway mentioned earlier that her ""experience"" lasted approximately 18 hours. Constantine states that the recorder contained approximately 18 hours of static. This ruins the ending of the movie, because it proves beyond any reasonable doubt that Dr. Arroway's experience was real. Up to this moment the audience is allowed to be split as to their beliefs. We may want to believe in Dr. Arroway's fantastic journey, but we have to weigh that against her loneliness, her need to validate her research, and her fervent belief in extraterrestrial life. Did she actually leave? Was it a hoax by Hadden as Kitz suggests? Is Hadden actually from Vega? Did she imagine the whole thing? Is she lying? How can we decide? It's a question of belief, but the data recorder removes the audience from the equation and makes the decision for us.In a movie about belief without proof, why ham-handedly supply proof? Why is the audience not left to believe what they want?",Contact

345,Alfredo_Griselda,'Revision..Not Concision,6,6 September 2009,"'Revision..Not Concision'..Too Busy Planning the Y2K/9-11 Demolitions Part I Originally, review of this movie found some fault with the short shrift given to the novel's breathtaking resolution. Usually the movie based on a book should at least attempt to preserve that, but it was mathematical, not unlike the computer models so excellently done in the movie--so it's debatable there were other motivations to further dumb down the content. Computer graphics are OK, just don't give people any ideas; and that's roughly the paranoid police state's continuing theme from movie to movie. So paranoid in fact, former head of creativity for Walt Disney Company Eric Hazeltine headed up a Discover magazine round table with American mathematics leaders to discuss no longer teaching long division in the public schools (9/'02). The point is, he was also a figure in the NSA meddling by some 'association', thus we have a connected set of reciprocating facts surrounding what Sen. J. W. Fullbright called, ""The Pentagon Propaganda Machine"", largely channeled through the movies. So it's all about this idea of using cybernetic controls to pose as an alien threat, or the ultimate hack into human consciousness or tool for propagating torture and psychological conditioning on the population called Quantum Information and Communications (many titles are in the university library). And of course it has to have exclusive control over Artificial Intelligence, rumored to have begun development under DARPA way back in the 50s. Noam Chomsky tries not to allude to it very much, unsuccessfully, in his book ""Language and Problems of Knowledge"". The brain is sort of a language processor, so better look out for that character. Thus, the public is condescended to in this film quite miserably; I was expecting less overacting and more science. I guess any theater company's rendition of 'Trouble in Tahiti' is going to disappoint some of the audience by a wide margin, or fail to capture many important elements of the story. Certainly the effort to push Shakespearian English on the modern drama goes without question as the worst form of retro. So when we go to the movies, expectations should consider anything possible. I guess it wasn't so bad...except for the effort at incorporating docudrama...with news coverage and Clinton's Mars Rock tape. That got off subject by confusing current events with a science fiction story. Of course the San Diego cult's execution has nothing whatsoever to do with any of this, or that viewing technology misrepresented in ""Quantum Gravity"" by Lee Smolin, or that other industry promo by Spielberg in 'Minority Report'. What can be done? Any book is going to drive the movie projector and production of the imagination about 10 times better than a movie ever will or ever could. This is why motion picture propaganda is so easily filleted. (Take for instance the continent hopping, double murder insurance scam in 'Flight Plan'--and other unsophisticated macho pieces) Movies are a kind of opiate for the masses, they're literally feeding off their sponsor's desperate desires to condescend and intimidate, pride in playing everyone for a fool, and more importantly a serious propaganda problem of a warfare level of escalation, such as the movie 'The Forgotten' which tries to blame missing persons (like the prior movie) and modern disasters on aliens. Is extraterrestrial intelligence an important question for concern? It certainly is so far as the evasion of crime under such a ridiculous proxy to condition public passivity. Does it lend itself to any practical context with the down to earth? I doubt it. And the reason is actually more curiously redirected to the question...it is comprising more offshoot entertainment themes that posit a different universe or a different consciousness than was expected...movies like 'The Matrix', 'CUBE', 'THX', 'Planet of the Apes' or allegorical time travel settings. So who knows? It doesn't interest as much as it used to, the bigger questions of course being the unceasing war on many levels between the various cultures of human beings, and not short of arriving in the American daily life. Science fiction has always been a social prospectus or blueprint for great dreams of beyond even urban planning, as have terrorist political movements always envisioned since earlier in the 20th Century. Then here we are right where it's thinking nothing of clearing the way, i.e. building demolitions and war spawned genocides. Let's take a look at one thing that was brought up in the earlier review, that being the oddity of the crop circles and elaborate glyphs. That certainly hints at a sign extraterrestrial presence maybe. Because you know, science and technology are not a static thing. In the 1950s diplomacy attempted to shake the earth in the South Pacific with hundred of enormous hydrogen bomb blasts, so called testing that was more a race of saber rattling...and of course its high aloft radioactive fallout disintegrated enough tri atomic oxygen to form the ozone hole...a fact that has to hide behind a courtesy screen in a book title like ""Ozone Diplomacy"". The 'official science' doesn't add up, contrasting the Northern polar region's allegedly intact ozone layer where all the industrial CFCs were produced after all, and by the way, all the ozone from tailpipes of millions of automobiles at the same time.

Yet the movie hammers with you this regurgitated nonsense ""are we alone in the universe?"". How do we know anything at all? Well young Ellie knew very well that if she put the medicine on first floor near her dad she would of saved him? As the Catholic priest in the movie stated that some things must be known and can just be stated to be the Will of God. Yet Ellie SLAMS that religious idiot for stating such a thing by stating what ""would of happened"" if she did ""something else"". How does Ellie exactly know this? She doesn't. Yet it has been hammered in your face that anyone with ""spiritual beliefs"" or belief in God is clueless while the movie creates this imaginary land of SETI detecting a signal from a planet light years away. This is just fantasy. Nonsense. And not because ""its impossible"" or as the movie likes you to think ""you're just foolish for no believing this"", but because such a thing If ever did happened already follows the assumptions of the radical empiricist paradigm or modern scietism, which makes it seem as if there are these ""objective facts"" that ""scientists"" or ""experts in their field"" know that other people don't. And so this movie (like many MANY others (in fact a vast majority of hollywood movies) perpetuate this exact idea.

This is a testament to the vision and depth of Carl Sagan.The journey Ellie takes through the loss of her father at the beginning of the movie, to her realization at the end, is a metaphor for mankind's journey. It is a tale of loss and redemption, of faith denied and regained, a subtle and beautiful story with a powerful message: science and religion are not adversarial, but rather two sides of the same coin. They do not oppose each other by nature, only when people make it so.
Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey play their parts perfectly as Ellie and Palmer, physical embodiments of science and religion. The film shows how the threads of their lives intertwine, and although they flirt with each other, they never truly get together. Tom Skerritt also stands out as the oily David Drumlin, who is so good in his role that you cannot help but clench your fists involuntarily the moment he appears on screen.The ending of the film, though fulfilling, is not nearly as good as the ending in the novel.

Because well, not a lot happens.The acting was good, very good in fact and Jodie Foster is one of the best actresses around and she puts in a studied performance and portrays an idealist scientist with compassion and verve admirably, so credit to her. This movie is far from a bad movie, and there are really intriguing aspects to it. There are many plot lines that could have been developed further, the aspect of the unknown could have been tapped into more, so too could have been the threat that a contact with an unknown quantity of alien life could be to our planet. This had a great opportunity to develop when the guy sacrificed himself with the bomb before the first mission. BUt they didn't go in depth of why he did it. They mentioned briefly through a news report he did it to save the human race, but the very next day she leaps on to the next ship regardless and went ahead with it. Thus taking away the dark themes that could have been presented.There is an awful lot of talking in the movie! and thats a good thing if they have something captivating to say, but a lot of the movie is talk without relative action. I mean I'm not askin for guns and lazers necessarily but a little more spark in the film would have been nice. Even the love interest which was focused on had no spark.Any relative emotion in this film was watered down or completely ignored, and there was an irritating emphasis on the media which was not well delivered by the director. I saw the directors point, the media has a huge part to play in US society, but they didn't do anything either-they didn't seem to be obtrusive and the characters payed little heed to them, so what was the point in its emphasis? when the guy blew himself up, to end the mission, one brief grieving scene from a news report was all they could come up with. The film makers can't get off that easy they need to try a little harder interms of creating emotion, suspense or intrigue to some degree.I felt the biggest cop-out was the end, with the film desperately in need of a boost they thought her trip through worm holes and space was enough and the prospect of an alien would wet our appetite. Her trip failed to be as breathtaking as it should have been, and it really did feel like were were watching a simulation programme. Regardless it was the most interesting bit in the movie. So she meets the alien, this was the movies last chance to cause a shock but in the end decided more talking was good enough. Thus we are presented with her dad, apparently the alien downloaded him from her brain and the alien in the form of her dad says to her "" We thought this image would be easier for you,"" but i couldn't help but think the director basically just said 'We thought this image would be easier for us!' In other words little imagination was required and again fobbed the audience off with more muffled sentiment. This movie is neither here nor there in the end. It didn't know whether it wanted to be a drama or a news report from CNN either way it was long and turgid and about as captivating an experience as watching weeds grown on your back lawn.",Contact
359,thisisgere,A biased review (this movie was made for me),10,31 August 2021,"I watched this movie with very little knowledge about it. Halfway through the movie I felt a connection with the plot. Only after i was done, did i learn that it was written by Carl Sagan and that man is one of the most influential in my life. The movie had a slow pace but I felt it was necessary given the subject matter. The actors could have been a bit more believable (MC is waaay too attractive to be all the things he is in this movie) The story does meander at bits but the message is just amazing!The bit that stuck with me was how The protagonist was disqualified to represent humanity because she was not one of them....religious (or as i think of it, stupid, lazy and self centered)

360,Chockys,The last great sci-fi's super-production,10,31 August 2010,"After the release in 1968 of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", sci-fi reached his maturity and it lived great moments of triumph and success in the 70's and 80's with movies like ""THX 1138"", ""Logan's Run"", ""Blade Runner"" and ""Terminator"", among others. In the 90's, nevertheless, sci-fi lived other kind of moment thank to movies like this. Based on the Carl Sagan's novel book of the same name, I think that this movie exceeded the book to be a show of first class: a spectacular cast, good described characters, impressive F/Xs, excellent locations around the world and a well-studied look in every frame filmed by Robert Zemeckis turns this movie in a tour de force for the people who enjoy of one the best movies appeared in 1997. It is a deep reflection about our origin and place in the cosmos so like an emotional travel to answer the eternal question: ""is there anybody out there?""Behind of this simple question, it hides an intense look inside us. The movie forces us to look inside our hearts and souls, reviewing our hopes and fears about the possibility not to be the only one living race in the universe. Jodie Foster, turned in the heroine of the show, is a scientist who fights against all odds in her search to find extraterrestrial life in the universe. Her search has success when a message from the stars come to Earth that it suggests that not only there's life but it exists a way to contact it. Through of her eyes we see all the human reactions that the existence of alien life causes, from fear and paranoia to euphoria and hope. Through the characters, we can see all kind of people, from good ones and honest who looking for the common good to bad ones that they are crazy or they want success and power at all costs. Like all good sci-fi's movie, in the end ""Contact"" talks about humanity, about human condition and about human beings.After ""Contact"" there hasn't been other movie like this. No one of the next sci-fi hits (Armageddon, Pitch Black, Alien Vs Predator, Pandorum, etc...) kept the capacity to make a reading of the humanity like the old movies did (""2001"", ""Blade Runner"" or the own ""Contact""). I think that this ability, obligatory to make any great sci-fi movie, has been lost. Above his mistakes, ""Contact"" mixes elements that turns him in an amazing show for all ages: personal dramas, ambition, search of the truth, conspiracy, love, treachery, loss of beloved beings, thriller and includes a little of comedy. The visual force is so big that by it and others reasons I say that ""Contact"" is the last great sci-fi's super-production: because the search of extraterrestrial life species is essentially the search of our own identity like human species.",Contact

I think the whole movie, from opening sequence ( where some of the photograps used are actual deep space objects,  I.E. the Magellic Cloud )was beautifully shot and wonderfully scripted. The cinematography was excellent, as was the plot, dialogs, and Jodie Foster played the part perfect. Tom Skerrit just takes commands in wahtever role he takes on. Matthew McConagheys performance even wasn't that bad, surprisingly.Even the role of the crazy preacher, who played Muldoon in that movie "" Stoned Age "" was convincing as a terrorist who is trying to protect the world of all things "" ungodly "". The scenes when Jodie Foster travles throught the worm holes ( which, thier existance was even acknowledged by Steven Hawking himself ) , and then she meets her father on that beautiful celstial beach , was so touching it made me actually tear up!

362,RadkoMilanov,Good Epic Film...,7,10 January 2008,"My comment will be focused not on the subject of the film but on the films characteristics themselves. In cinema there are some main anchors points to which you can attach a film piece to and ""Contact"" is tagged to a very powerful one - an EPIC FILM. The difference between epic film ""wanna  be"" and real epic films, is that the real ones seem to have been a part of your life once the credits start to roll. All of us know this feeling very well, as we have all seen ""The Godfather"". Epic films usually tend to go outside the realms of the genre they were meant to be. That is why you can not say that ""Contact"" is an action or an action flick, even though it has most characteristics of both. There is drama in there too but its not that either, it's an epic film. Camera-work is on a decent level. Effects are well done. The film was not ruined by intolerable clichés phrases or dialogs. The plot was a hard one to get through, if you don't know what you're doing but that is not the case with Mr. Zemeckis. No matter of how controversial the topic may be to the audience, it is and will remain, as one of the thumbs up films of the 90's archives, because as far as cinematographic arts criteria go it is surely above the mediocre.A good example of an epic film.7/10",Contact

However I thoroughly enjoyed ""Contact"" because of its plausibility. While most of the ""action"" might seem rather un-exciting when compared to beasts like ""Independance Day"" or ""Men in Black"", it happens to be infinitely more powerful! Much like a piece of classical music often contains more intensity than some heavy-metal song that entirely depends on loud guitars. Apart from a few small details (only noticed by a select public of rocket scientists), the search for and discovery of the extraterrestrial signals happens just like it would in end-of-20th-century reality.That's what nailed me to my seat: I felt it extremely easy to identify with Jodie Foster. In fact I was completely absorbed. It's difficult to describe the excitement that I felt when the first signal is detected, or during the scary 2001-ish spacetime trip. When she ended up on that beautiful beach with the super-viscose atmosphere (what a GREAT alien-ating effect!!), I had completely Left The Building. Almost saw Elvis at that point :-)I agree that the actual meeting with the Aliens is susceptible to criticism, just like the ending. But I challenge anyone to come up with better alternatives! At least the ""lack of proof"" bit was thought-provoking. Which is proven by the fact that both religious and atheistic people interprete it as an argument in favour of their personal conviction.

376,jeeves-1,Different from the book doesn't mean bad.,10,20 September 2002,"I am used to hearing from just about everyone who has read a book that was made into a movie that the book is always better.  I tend to agree with this opinion.  Contact, however, shows that in the arts the norm is not always the truth; opinion, no matter how often it is backed up with evidence, can never break through the barrier into be a hardened and absolute truth.I saw this movie first before I read the book.  That is partly because I didn't know that there was the book until after the movie.  So, a year or so after the viewing, I got the book.  Of course, the movie, in general terms, follows the book fairly well.  I have to say, the movie can easily stand on its own merits just as the book can also.The immediate impression of the film after the book is that there is a great emphasis on faith, proof, truth and opinion.  These themes are not much brought up in the book - at least not with the same impact nor in the same way as in the film.  Of course, the field of Astrophysics, of which Carl Sagan was a practitioner, lends itself very easily to ultimate questions such as God, faith, truth etc.  The vastness of space and complexity of reality, viewed through the scrutiny of the scientific eye, is mind-boggling.  As was repeated in the movie several times: ""if we're all that there is, ""its an awful waste of space.""  Personally, I think that the book relates these notions of vastness and complexity much better than the movie.  But, the audience of the book was certainly not necessarily the same audience as the movie.To be more fair, the vastness which was expressed in the book was demonstrated to an equal degree, but differed in quality, by the ""aloneness"" of Dr. Arroway as she scuttles across the universe.  In the book, Dr. Arroway is not alone but go with a team of scientists, all of whom make their appearance in the movie.  There is much more detail given in the book of the trip through the device than in the movie.  In fact, there are very deliberate omissions made which eliminate the technological bent of the book.  Yet, the focus of the movie does not allow the movie to be diminished by these omissions in the same way that the book would unavoidably be lacking without those details.One final aspect of the movie which is relevant with respect to the book is time.  Of course, in physics, time has its leading role so it must make at least a cameo in a movie which relies on physics.  Astrophysics is tied inextricably to relativity which is likewise tied to time.  The timelessness of the device design sent via radio signals and the instantaneous trip Dr. Arroway seemed to put relativity into perfect perspective.  The book takes a slightly different view by using distance and the experience of each traveler of moving fast distances with no other apparent sensations of motion.  It all adds up to different but equal expressions of the science which Carl Sagan had mastered.Both the book and the movie are simply fantastic, one not outshining the other as regards their scope and vision.  Watch the film, it is a beautiful one.  Read the book, it is equally beautiful.",Contact

It starts with a wonderfully crafted story that winds around the most important questions humanity has asked itself. The acting is very well done. The depth of the characters is well represented. The pace is perfect. The suspense holds, breaks, and returns until the conclusion.

381,lakewoodmatt67,What a beautiful film...,10,22 May 2013,"From the mind of astronomer Carl Sagan, and flawlessly directed by Robert Zemeckis, ""Contact"" tells the story of a young astronomer/scientist named Ellie Arroway, played to perfection by Jodie Foster, who discovers a message from outer space that may finally be proof of intelligent life in the universe. The message is mathematical in nature, but basically details blueprints for a vehicle intended to bring its occupant to the star Vega, from where the message is originating. Director Zemeckis is in familiar waters here, blending fiction seamlessly with reality; such as actual footage from press conferences with former president Bill Clinton, as well as cameos by a host of news personalities, all playing themselves. What Zemeckis started in ""Forrest Gump"" is refined and improved in ""Contact"", an unfairly underrated and under-appreciated parable about science, religion and the great gulf that separates them.In addition to Jodie Foster's superlative work, more outstanding performances from stars such as James Woods, Tom Skerritt and Matthew McConaughey round out a truly stellar cast, pun definitely intended. In the course of the story, the argument of ""god"" vs. science is brought up consistently, but Zemeckis wisely refrains from taking a side here, instead allowing the viewer to make their own decision on which ""truth"" is the real one. (On a personal note: I, myself, would be classified as a ""non-believer"" HOWEVER, I also subscribe to the practice of logic. In this case, the logical conclusion that the universe in and of itself MUST have had a ""first cause"", and as a result, something or someone HAD to have caused that first cause.) As the worldwide news of this incredible discovery spreads, and the device itself is constructed, we are consistently shown both sides of the debate, neither viewpoint canceling out the other. Perpetual questions are raised: Are we alone in the universe? If not, who or what are our neighbors? Where are we in terms of evolution in comparison to any other lifeforms that may or may not exist? These questions are explored, but the answers left ambiguously unanswered, leaving the viewer forced to come to their own conclusion, their own process of determining the truth.Just one more thing...the final thirty minutes or so of ""Contact"" provide Foster's uncovering of what may or may not be the answers she, and we too, all are seeking. And then, there is a scene, which I'll not spoil for you, that shows Foster's attaining closure with a loved one who initiated her path in life. If you have a human heart beating within you, and you've ever mourned or yearned for someone you've lost, this scene will have you in tears, just as it's done to me again and again...In the end, ""Contact"" urges us all to find our own answers to the burning questions we have in our minds. As a parable of society's perception of faith vs. fact, it is superlative. As a study of humanity and it's place in the universe, it simply is perfection. If you've not seen ""Contact"" before, you owe it to yourself to experience this at least once in your life.What a beautiful film.",Contact

The matter of the fact is that this scientist found out many unknown facts through faith and memory. She experienced a memorable journey out of this world that has changed her opinions and visions of life in extraordinary ways. She thinks she knows enough, but she comes back with unexplainable events capable of confusing everyone else that comes across her. She left many people with questions and disbelief.

383,Ariel_Ronnie,Contact (1997),9,10 September 2009,"Director: Robert Zemeckis Cast: Jodie Foster, Matthew McConaughey, Tom Skerritt, James Woods, Angela Bassett, John Hurt, David Morse, William Fichtner, Geoffrey Blake, Sami Chester, Timothy McNeil. Running Time: 153 minutes Rated PG for some intense action, mild language and a scene of sensuality. All of the greatest work by the greatest scientists has been done while they were very young, when they were stupid enough to believe that two-plus-two-equals-five, and pursued it instead of listening to all of those who were much older and wiser who said Don't Waste Your Time. Einstein, it has been said, asked all of his important questions before the age of twenty-five, then spent the rest of his life working on them. ""Contact"", directed by Robert Zemeckis (""Forrest Gump"", ""Back to the Future""), is the story of a young scientist, Ellie Arroway (Jodie Foster), who like Einstein and all the greats before her, has been asking questions and seeking answers since she was very young. And now, as a member of the SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) team, she is able to pursue her obsession with the mysteries of the galaxies and the infinite universe that surrounds us. Her job is to sweep the skies, using the most sophisticated equipment available, for a signal from deepest space. It may be her job, but for Ellie it's a labor of love, for she is convinced that there is something, or someone, out there somewhere, because otherwise, she reasons, what a terrible waste of space it would be. Ellie may be a dreamer, but she knows in her heart that it is the dreamers who over the years have been responsible for making us evolve, making us learn and grow because they are the ones who take insane, foolish ideas and pursue them. And to her, two-plus-two will always be five. Ellie loves her job and believes in what she is doing, but it's been a struggle over the years, as she and others have had to constantly fight for the funding necessary to keep the project alive, begging for dollars from short-sighted, unimaginative people with vision that goes only as far as the bottom line of their budget book. It's been a tough row to hoe, and she's had to swallow a lot of pride over the years, but then one day it all pays off, when in one magic moment she hears what she's been waiting for all her life: A signal from a distant end of the galaxy-- someone attempting to communicate, to make contact, with the people of the Earth. Ellie and her team soon realize that, whomever it is, they are using the universal language of prime numbers in their attempts at making contact; and when Ellie deciphers the code, she discovers something monumental in the bargain. But it's a message of global importance, something much bigger than she and her team alone, and she soon find herself fighting to remain a part of the drama that is only beginning to unfold-- the first interaction between human beings and an alien life form. And it's only the beginning of the adventure and the wondrous places this film is about to take you. Jodie Foster gives a performance here that demonstrates what a gifted, talented actor she is. Her Ellie is convincing and believable, and someone to whom you can genuinely relate, no matter who you are or where you're from, because there is something universal in Ellie's passion and longing to discover the truth and to see beyond the veil of our limited mortal capacities. There's a strength to Ellie, born of a combination of intelligence and innocence, as well as tenacity and faith, and Foster manifests all of these complexities of her character beautifully, with a performance that should've landed her an Oscar nomination. In this role, she is simply as good as it gets. The supporting cast includes David Morse (Ted Arroway), Matthew McConaughey (Palmer), Geoffrey Blake (Fisher), William Fichtner (Kent), Tom Skerritt (David), James Woods (Kitz) and Angela Bassett (Rachel). Zemeckis did a brilliant job of bringing this film to fruition, especially in the way he allowed Foster the time to really develop her character, by giving her that extra moment at just the right time that ultimately meant so much in the final analysis. Too often it's those few minutes that wind up on the cutting room floor that make the difference between a good film and an exceptional one; and between Zemeckis and Foster, they took it to the edge by taking some chances to realize that combined vision, which in the end made this a great film.

388,sandyb,It coulda been brilliant -- but it's not,3,9 April 1999,"This could have been a brilliant story -- but, of course, that's simply not possible in Hollywood. The Club Med encounter with the alien species was ridiculous. Either show us the greebies or, if not, then the film's creators should leave the audience with such a sense of otherness or ""alien-ness"" as to make us appreciate just how strange it would be to encounter an extraterrestrial intelligence (e.g. the singing slab in 2001). The scene in which the aliens are first heard is exciting -- and so it should be. The plot would have been far more interesting if it had delved more in the confirmation and translation of the data they sent than with the mindless hearings on Capitol Hill as to whether there is a God or not. Let's be real, here. Were we to hear from another civilization, the first things Congress would be called on to determine is can we protect outselves against them (if they are dangerous) and how much would it cost to communicate and/or meet them. Just can't see how God would figure into this conversation. Anyway, as for the acting. Well, I can't stand Jodie Foster; she's an artistic fraud. But, she is rather good at playing herself (i.e. an intelligent person). She had zero chemistry with lover boy there, but, of course, she always aims to place herself in the center of a film, even if that is at the expense of the rest of the cast and the film's artistic integrity.

The book is good in its own way - a little artificial but that is to be expected when a scientist turns to fiction.One recurring theme in the book is the search for the truth and the search for the numinous experience (the religious). This theme is very much present in the movie. In the book Ellie is an agnostic, a sceptic both as a scientist and in her spiritual life. In the movie she is made a logical positivist. Well this is to be expected since you have to be explicit when making movies.But in the movie Ellie has to accept the fact that her only way of justifying what she knows to be the truth is by a leap of faith, thus making traditional religion the ""winner"" of the debate, the book explicitly says that Ellie finds concrete proof of her version of the truth, thus all but eliminating the element of faith.The movie thus ends with the opposite conclusion of the book.When the book was about the search for truth, the possibility of extra terrestrial life, and the inherent beauty of life. The movie pretty much boils it down to being an preaching on the gospel of organised religion.I didn't like it because I've read the book. But as a film it didn't work to well either.

I was at my friend's house, and she wanted to watch her latest purchase from Blockbuster, and I wanted to watch Alice in Wonderland again. After agreeing to watch her three-dollar-rental-with-a-free-bag-of-pop-corn with the popcorn on *my* side of the couch, I became spellbound by the extaordinary story written by Carl Sagan. Admittedly, I love Sci-Fi. I watch the X-Files every Sunday night, and I can't get enough out of Douglas Adam's writing. But Contact is not just a science fiction flick. There's so much more to the movie. It is about one scientist's hurtles with life trying to find extra terrestrial intelligence and the problems and decisions she must make in order to achieve Contact with other life. Jodie Foster is at her best as the determined scientist Ellenore Arroway. Her love interest, Joss Palmer (Mathew McConaughey) beings out the other side of Ellie that doesn't involve searching for ""little green men"".  Robert Zemeckis' work is beautifully done and touching, especially the scene in which young Ellenore's father dies. Instead of making it a sappy death scene that forces you to cry, Jena Malone (playing Young Ellie) show's the devestated girl with superb acting that will move you. Angela Bassett plays the President's right hand (wo)man sharp, intelligent, and down to earth. David Drumlin, Ellenore's enemy, is played viciously by a deliciously sinister Tom Skerrit.My only dissapointment in this film is that it ended to soon (hardly, it actually runs a little long but the plot is so thick and detailed the time goes by quickly).

400,gidogido,Nice sci-fi but director tries to force misplaced sentiments through your throat,6,23 August 2013,"I'm kind of sciencefiction fanatic but for some reason Contact never attracted me. But after hearing some OK stories I decided to view it after all this time it was released.Beforehand I knew it was about mankind making contact with an alien source and the whole builtup to that happening was executed very good. The whole deciphering part of the signal felt a bit like an Indiana Jones adventure. Very smart writing. What I didn't like at all was that I felt the director was trying to please both the church goers and scientists. I got no clue at all why a huge chunk of the story was reserved for a science vs religion debate. What was the point? And to please the atheists/scientist a fundamental Christian terrorist was thrown in. Like he wanted to say ""hey you can't blame me that I must be sponsored by the church! I wrote a Christian terrorist in the story!"" It all felt really misplaced for me. Like a scene from a different movie. They could have written out the whole Matthew McConaughey part and it would be a better movie. His role was just stupid. For a scifi geek the whole building of the wormhole-portal machine was just great. And it got even better when the whole travelling part began. After watching the intro of the movie where we saw the planet Earth zooming out to our Galaxy, then clusters and then the whole Universe I was hoping that something would happen again and it did. With wormhole travelling. It really felt like a roller-coaster ride. The actual arrival on the alien planet felt a bit disappointing. The alien who dressed up as her dad was lame. Maybe it was original then but I just wanted to see the imagination of what an alien lifeform would look like according to the director. So that was disappointing.So if the story would be all about Jody Fosters ambition without the pointless religion crap and the love affair with Matthew McConaughey I would have given it an 8 probably.

That doesn't mean that every loose end needs to be tied up, but that the viewer/reader is left with a sense that their journey has come to an acceptable conclusion.

407,ienosretep,Contact: A Study of the Relationship Between Science and Religion (very mild spoiler inside),9,29 May 2020,"When I say ""sci-fi"", you probably think of something like Star Wars, Star Trek, or maybe the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Galaxy Quest, Alien, Pixels, to name a few more. These movies and more are entertaining action movies, some funny, some scary. But Contact is a different kind of science fiction: the quiet, thought-provoking kind that filled the '80s and '90s. This type is more along the lines of, say, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Deep Impact, or Close Encounters of the Third Kind (all great movies, by the way).
Plot: Eleanor Arroway (Jodie Foster), having spent her whole life searching for signs of alien life via radio waves, finally finds radio and television transmissions coming from the star Vega. Using instructions hidden in the transmissions, Earth begins to prepare to, ahem, Contact their new neighbors.
Nowadays, this would be considered an unconventional science fiction film. There's no action to speak of, the aliens are never seen, and it's not even funny at all. Even special effects are somewhat minimal, only noticeably existing in a sequence near the end and one other scene. The thing that makes Contact great is how it leans fully into the philosophical nature of classic science fiction made famous by things like the original Star Trek or Close Encounters. This is not a film about aliens. It is about the religious implications of the discovery of alien life; it's about faith versus facts. These are the bases of religion and science, respectively. Contact is about the differences between science and religion, and introduces an instance where one must rely on the other. The end of the film is interesting in how it is left rather open-ended. (MILD SPOILER ALERT, SORRY) Viewers are left to decide whether the special effects-laden sequence at the end actually happened, and either explanation seems equally probable, so different people may interpret the story differently. Eleanor finds herself choosing to believe she saw what she did solely based on faith, even though she has no evidence of any kind and even admits that what she saw may have just been a dream.
I'm terrible at conclusions, so I'll just repeat my point: Contact is great because of how it works with the concepts of science and religion and forces the former to rely on the primary basis of the latter. I highly recommend this film.",Contact
408,painbros22,Less Sci-fi more Pre-Chee,3,19 August 2012,"I remember on my first viewing of Contact back in 97 i was quite captivated by it. It was a very risky sci-fi movie for the time. There are no spaceships zipping around shoot death star shaped objects. There is no improbable hero. There are no three eyed aliens. Even so Contact was fascinating. That was back in 97.I just watched the movie now in 2012 an oh how nostalgia sometimes is ripped apart by a second viewing. Once again i was fascinated, by the first 30 Min's, which is gripping. Things go really downhill after that where smart science is thrown out the window for things like time travel. Its a very strange mix to suddenly shift from ""plausible"" to ""blatent impossibility"".Then it struck me how much of a complete cop out the whole movie is on many levels. The audience goes through many levels of expectation only to be left down by a really bad punchline in the plot. The film starts by being grounded and interesting. The whole sequence of events when the first signal is received is just as exciting for us as it is for the scientists on the screen. You can feel the wonder of what being in that situation would be like. Then things start to take a surreal turn. The intelligent science is now technobabble. Its very hard to be riveted by discussions about waves within waves and when Hitler is suddenly thrust into things you start to feel you are being preached to. The preaching thus continues throughout the whole movie to one degree or another. Not thought provoking stuff, this is Hollywood preaching where everything is explained to you. But the biggest cop out of all is ""the beach scene"". As a viewer you have just been through the ordeal of Jodie Foster being thrust through wormholes. After an experience like that you almost deserve a good pay off. You go through all that, the whole movie, waiting for the point when you will see the extraterrestrial life. Oh dear. Its a beach with Jodies dad. I understand the point behind the scene, i understand that it worked out in the book, but here it feels out of place.Contact really does not know what it wants to be, it tries to be many things but ends up getting bogged down by the very simplified notion of science and religion working together. It overshadows the whole point of the first contact event. I never connect religion with science. Science is truth. Religion is faith. But in the case of Contact religion simply bullies and seduces science. Science is left to cow tow to religion asking for its acceptance. This happens when doubt is raised. The Hollywood preaching machine is simply telling you ""heck if it can't be explained just have faith"". Thats the ""deep"" message you are left with. Its not even written in a way where the viewer can have any doubts. Everything is said time and time again until ""you get it"". After Ms fosters very long speech about ""having faith"" ( in case you missed it already ) there is a scene which negates everything just said by proving you didn't need faith really anyway cause its all real. The ultimate cop out. The revelation itself is the dumbest thing ever. Nobody whatever thought about putting a clock on the pod ? Nobody noticed really quickly that 18 hours of static was recorded ? Did they just watch it for 3 Min's ? Its just too dumb to comprehend especially when Ms Foster character is basically called a liar. ""you're a liar"" ""oh no you're not"". It's that black and white.If Contact had been smart about its preaching it would have been a much more enjoyable. Instead the religious stuff is just eye rolling bad which makes it a chore to sit through. Its a shame really, the idea behind it all is fine, it just fails to deliver on what it promises.",Contact

It is realistic in many ways in that we are most likely to make contact with Extra-terrestrials via signals received from space.The acting is pretty good, especially from McConaughey.I did not however like the ending to this movie.  When Ellie travels to Vega or wherever in that travelling device, the aliens don't even show themselves. Instead we just see an image of her father on some blurry beach. I was very disappointed in this.  The aliens think that she can't handle her seeing them as they really are?  Give me a break.  Also, they don't even give her something to prove that she has really travelled there, and when she comes back to Earth, nobody believes her and she is ridiculed.  There are unanswered questions like when the next person is supposed to travel. All the aliens can tell her is that is has always been done this way. Basically, we learn very little from this movie at the end.  Perhaps a sequel would be a good idea where someone travels to Vega and stays there for a period to learn.Also, the fact that Ellie was initially rejected for the mission because she wasn't a religious person was a little unrealistic.  The mission was to travel to meet aliens, not God.To summarise, I enjoyed this movie apart from the ending which I thought was a cop out.",Contact
415,gingerkris,Films are rarely as good as the bookbut there are exceptions to the rule,8,22 October 2004,"This remains true for this very good adaptation of the classic book by Carl Sagan. Sagans' idea was to make science and the elite commandeering of information available to the majority, he wrote his books for a wide audience and I think the film shows this as was intended by its author.The Film is roughly about Dr Arroway, Ellie, and how she handles being alone in a world without family or close friends. It is metaphorically able to make us all think about how isolated we as a race, and as people can feel. Ellie, a brilliant young scientist working on the mistrusted SETI program discovers a message sent to earth from distant star system Vega. On its discovery Ellie must battle with the Military, Pentagon, and Male Dominated scientific world to keep her cards on the table and her discovery that of her team. Ellie is constantly kept in the game by he benefactor, a rich technological industrialist mogul who has a vested interest in her participation of the programme to reach this alien culture.I don't wish to go on any further and spoil this movie as I rate it as a fantastic exploration of Science Vs Religion and the entire subsequent human spectrum in between. As a film there were several alterations from the book that I felt could have been included, for example not just one traveler but a range of them, philosophers, theologists, scientists, poets and Dr Arroway.I have watched this film a number of times and still find it a joy to watch the fifth, eighth and tenth time. Jody foster playing a not so dissimilar to her role in Silence of the lambs (attractive, clever, young, successful woman battling in a male world) is exceptional and delivers feeling and intellect alongside an impressive script.I would give this film an 8.5 and recommend it to anybody, but if you are a sci-fi fan and haven't seen this film then you're in for a treat.",Contact

All is crushed, however, by the weight of solemn movieplex convention: shouting into the wind, unfolding steadycam vista with soaring soundtrack, eccentric billionaire and nefarious black shoe, and technology so shiny it resembles a high-end cosmetic counter. Ideationally, the movie has all the intellectual courage and wisdom of a Howard Hughes anti-commie second feature of the fifties starring a semi-sober star in retrograde. More specifically, the faith vs science argument is propped up, referenced, alluded to, and even enacted (at times), but nothing is resolved in a meaningful way. We learn that space is very very big, space travel is like a waterslide, that ancestor worship can pay spiritual dividends, and that science is very similar to religion, in that both can be overlaid with sloppy sentimentality and imbued with supernatural talismans of womblike delight.

There was also things added that wasn't needed. This should be re-made for television and not use the screenplay as the template. It is terrible.

418,eluhnabroad,The First Science Fiction Chick Flick,8,9 February 2008,"The nature and purpose of science fiction is to go ""out there,"" exploring realms on the edge of imagination. Sometimes for pure fun, as in Star Wars; sometimes as a means of exploring deeper philosophical questions such as the nature and possible fate of humanity.But in the rush out to the edge, science fiction movies often leave many people behind. Once in a while, a movie gets made that starts out on hard, familiar ground and takes viewers along on the journey to the stars. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" was one such film; this is another.While ""Contact"" isn't quite the cinematic classic that ""2001"" is, it has many fine moments; beginning with the opening sequence, which starts out with our familiar Earth and takes us on a mind-bending journey out into the far reaches of the universe. I've never seen a better illustration of the true scale of the Cosmos and of our place in it. This alone should make this film required viewing for school children. It will make future astronomers out of a lot of them.For all the grandness of the establishing shot, however, the story remains firmly on the ground for most of the film, as the receipt of a radio message from the stars raises fundamental questions, for both society and the individual characters, about matters of Science, God and Faith.The main flaw of this picture, however, is the almost-literal deus ex machina when Ellie, the main character, finally takes the Journey Beyond; only to (as a character in the movie well puts it) ""go windsurfing with dear, departed Dad."" The film dares neither to answer questions nor leave them unanswered, but chickens out with a coy ""it was all a dream -- or was it?"" ending.I also personally have a problem with the casting of Matthew McConaughey as Ellie's love interest. His self-conscious ""handsome rascal"" persona is irritating, and the chemistry between him and Jodie Foster is almost nonexistent. I also wonder if it's in Ms. Foster's contract that every movie she does must have a courtroom scene.Despite the flaws, ""Contact"" has plenty going for it, thematically and cinematically. One of the few ""grown-up"" science fiction films in existence. SF buffs will want to add it to their collection. You would also do well to get your non-""Trekkie"" friends to watch it; they jut might become converts -- or, at least, gain some understanding of why you're a fan.",Contact

429,porphyrous,A good realization of Sagan's sole work of fiction,7,11 January 2005,"There's little doubt that fans of Carl Sagan were apprehensive yet hopeful over the prospect of Dr. Sagan's only work of fiction, Contact, being made into a movie. In the science community, the expectations were so high that the movie never really had a fair chance, and the average movie-goer might not buy everything that Sagan provides us in his story. Though flawed, Contact is a great sci-fi movie, and good science movie, and a loving enactment of Sagan's optimistic vision of the future.The premise of the movie is based in one of Sagan's own initiatives, the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI). The possibility of life on other planets and elsewhere in space was an obsession of Sagan's. He privately wished that we in fact had been visited by extraterrestrials, but was enough of a true scientist to reject the UFO enthusiast community wholesale. In Contact, Sagan spun a story about what would happen if we indeed received a message from an extraterrestrial civilization, what form it would take, and how we would react to it.Jodie Foster is an excellent choice for Ellie Arroway, the optimistic radio astronomer who isn't far from a female analog of Sagan himself. Though Arroway runs into occasional ridicule, she is fortunate to spend much more of her time with supportive mentors. When the fateful day comes and a message is received from afar, she's there to make sense of it. The nature of that first message shakes everyone to their foundations -- was it a hoax? If not a hoax, why *this* message? Under the message is another message: instructions for how to build a device that will allow us to do....what? Travel there? Communicate with them? Nothing? Provide an entrée for a recipe from ""To Serve Man""? (If you don't get the reference, check out the episode of The Twilight Zone of the same name.) Two groups rush to build the device, and Arroway's team falls behind. The rival group's contraption self-destructs, so only Arroway's project remains to see if the end product actually does something.The movie's climax is 100 percent unadulterated eye candy. But ultimately, I was left unsatisfied by the movie's ending. Not only that, but the movie decides to take a pass on the mystical, numerological ending of the book. After all, Ellie is a scientist, not a trailer-park redneck. Her word should have meant a little more.Contact is a good movie, and an important movie, and by science fiction standards, it's a great movie (a sad commentary on the effort put into sci-fi movies in general).

I have had more success in compiling a list of Desert Island Movies, however: those films that I could bear to watch over-and-over if they were the only ones I had. 2 Bob Zemeckis films make that list (Back to the Future is the other one, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? comes close.) Every time I rewatch it, I find new things to appreciate without losing any of the magic it contains. The opening sequence in particular is still one of the finest ever committed to film - I'm glad I saw it in the cinema but even on the small screen it loses little of its power.As other reviewers have noted, ""intelligent"" SF is a rarity in films. And this is clearly very much a ""science"" fiction movie. What makes Contact so extraordinary is that it also respects religion without trivialising either component, and challenges the viewer all the way through to stay one step ahead whilst still surprising you at every turn; the false-ending after the first machine explodes has to be up there with the very best.There are some holes to pick - ultimately, the big reveal at the end is less of a kicker than it should be (there would be other things to explain beyond just the static tape, and the whole hoax concept is just far too easy to rip to pieces), but that's not the point. What you get are a collection of marvellous performances, including Matthew McConaughy, who I usually can't abide, and a brilliantly creepy turn by Tom Skerritt, combined with silky smooth direction and a screenplay that expects you to follow what is going on - taking the ideas in Carl Sagan's original novel and extending them in ways that could only be done on screen. The biggest coup for me was making the climax of the film nothing to do with her ""close encounter"" at all, but the big showdown in Congress - a remarkable achievement but one that succeeds in bringing closure to the story in a way that Sagan's book never quite managed.Literally the only thing that dates this film is the (somewhat clumsy) inclusion of stock footage of President Bill Clinton.

I expected more ""God vs Science"" discussions in the movie, but the ones featured caught my attention, particular the conversation on the ballroom balcony.The climax was interesting, but not what I expected, which is disappointing.

Within minutes we have left the solar system and traversed the entire universe; then we find ourselves emerging from Ellie's eyes and realize that we are still right back at home after all.I think that is one of the basic themes of this movie: the cosmos may be vast and strange, but ultimately everything important is 'in our own backyard.'(Unlikely as it may seem, and in no way detracting from either movie, I can see parallels to the 'Wizard of Oz' here!)There are basically three sets of characters in this movie: (1) Ellie, who together with her science team and a mysterious benefactor, overcomes huge obstacles to achieve her goal of answering the scientific question, ""Are We Alone?""; (2) Palmer Joss, who is searching for his own answers through God (""No, We Are Not Alone""); and (3)Everyone Else. While Everyone Else is fairly well-intentioned towards Ellie and SETI, many of them lack her vision and a few are downright hostile!What the movie does make clear is that most of us are looking for much the same thing: Truth. By the end of the movie, however, the 'objective' Truth of science and the 'subjective' truth of God and spirituality have been irrevocably merged. Very thought-provoking!As an aside, I found it intriguing that one of 'Contact's most productive radio astronomers was blind. Astronomy is traditionally seen as a visual science: if so, this film removes that bias admirably.Whether you love this movie (as I do) may depend on whether you most identify with Ellie, Rev Joss, or Everyone Else.

It is almost beyond human ability. Everything in this movie fits together. Nothing is weak. Coming from a scientific background, I was especially pleased to see them get the science right. This movie got it right in a way that I have NEVER seen in any other movie. And no I don't mean how big can you make a spaceship or how detailed can you make an alien. I'm not talking visually realistic, but thoughtfully. Obviously they had some real brains behind this. The science works on many levels. Great science movies make things that are unprecedented logical and plausible. I loved the process whereby they received and decrypted the alien signal. The structure itself was magnificent. Such beautiful geometry and elegance. I've never seen a more beautiful structure contrived in any other movie. One almost thinks that if we were to build an intergalactic transport, this is what it would look like, and all we'd have to do is write the special effects artists for their blueprints. The images of space travel are awe-inspiring. They made me yearn to be there. They are not cheap. Watching them is an almost transcendental experience. The introduction of Mr. Hadden is brilliant. The movie was smart and knew that it could not just discredit Jodie's experience, it had to discredit the whole affair, including the source of the signal. Although I do have some questions about the movie's hypothesis that Hadden was behind the whole affair. If they had satellites from around the world tracking the signal, I doubt one earth-bound satellite controlled by Hadden could fool all of them. Also no doubt the brilliant sparking and glowing that came from within the structure provided some measure of proof as to its efficacy. I loved the way this movie touched upon the dichotomy between science and the unknown. I am a scientist. Thus I have been trained to use logic and evidence when examining issues. However, I am not so naive as to believe that science can currently explain everything. There are some things that science can not YET explain, but someday I believe it will. Afterall, science is simply the sum of our experiences with our environment (with some as of yet unproven theory in there). However I do not like the lumping together of what science cannot yet explain and religion. Perhaps someday science will reach the same conclusions as religion (doubtful I think). But there's a huge leap between what we currently know and what some religions postulate. And I for one am not willing to make that jump. At least science starts with experience or logic and extrapolates forward to theory. I think religion does the opposite. Sorry I've sidetracked from the review. But this is one of the most interesting issues the movie invokes for me. And I've only scratched the surface here. This movie is first-class in every way.",Contact

I have seen it many times before, though not as many as I have read it, and hence my rather bad review (I had to own it, since I am compiling a ""Complete Jodie Foster"" collection).I think, that it is a movie that one has to see, but to grasp the real point, one has to see it, and then read and understand!To do the movie justice, I am obliged to state, that the acting from Jodie Foster and a few of the other lead actors had nothing to do with my bad feelings about this movie. The acting is great, but the adaptation for the silver screen is below ordinary sub-standard!One can always comment on the simplification of the plot, when a book is being filmed, but in this case, it would seem, that the point of the book is the opposite of that of the film. In both, Dr. Arroway is the lead character, but I had the distinct feeling, that while the book is a way of telling other scientists, being or in spe, to consider their believes once more, with the shadow of ""religious faith"" influencing the line of thought, this movie seems to me to be nothing more than a shallow action drama, corroborating the thought, that ""scientists may provide the means of our way of life, but they are wrong, and should be cast into the fires of eternal damnation""!!!

It's not exactly like the book, and I wish the book's discussion of ""pi"" could have been included, but this is one of my favorite movies, and still is, nine years later. Get the deluxe DVD to explore just how difficult the movie was to make, the technical hurdles, the dedication of the actors. The deluxe edition has no fewer than three commentaries, one from Ms. Foster, one from the director and producer, and one from the technical team. Ordinarily, I would never listen to so much commentary coming from one movie, but I listened to them all, and watched the original movie over and over again to get a feel for the effort behind this production.

There are several realities possible based on observed fact. One should not conclude one as the truth and the others as false when there is no evidence to that fact as that would be unscientific.Christian religion gets such a huge dominating position in this movie.

There have been certain prophets who had only a limited following but received the infinite reward of the sacred duty of prophethood. The true achievement lies, then, not in gaining a vast following, but in gaining God's pleasure. What do you imagine yourself to be, that saying, ""Let everyone listen to me,"" you forget your function, and interfere in what is strictly God's concern? To gain acceptance for you and to have people gather round you is God's concern. So look to your own duty and concern, and do not meddle with God's concerns. Moreover, it is not only men who earn reward for those who hear and speak the truth. The sentient and spiritual beings of God and His angels have filled the universe and adorned its every part. If you want plentiful reward, take sincerity as your foundation and think only of God's pleasure. Then every syllable of the blessed words that issue forth from your mouth will be brought to life by your sincerity and truthful intention, and going to the ears of innumerable sentient beings, they will illumine them and earn you reward. For when, for example, you say, ""Praise and thanks be to God,"" millions of these words, great and small, are written on the page of the air by God's leave. Since the All-Wise Inscriber did nothing prodigally or in vain, He created innumerable ears, as many as were needed to hear those multiple blessed words. If those words are brought to life in the air by sincerity and truthful intent, they will enter the ears of the spirit beings like some tasty fruit in the mouth. But if God's pleasure and sincerity do not bring those words to life, they will not be heard, and reward will be had only for the single utterance made by the mouth.

Could the screen writers have given her character the opportunity of her intellect and examination of the weakness of religious belief (instead of the hackneyed dead dad as the reason), the scene of her wavering before the congressional committee would have been an excellent opportunity ""to discuss"" the weakness of religious belief and the strength of atheism.It was a weak film meant to throw a sop to the fanatic religious portion of society to verify their own view of who athiests are.""Remember back when you were born . . . what a blissfully, happy atheist you were?""",Contact

It falls short except in certain well-done areas, such as the opening and Ellie's journey.  The damage is done by convenient pacing and slick Hollywoodisms that were tired when Spielberg invented them twenty years ago.Very few films can get away with Zemeckis' brand of manipulative self-importance.  Contact takes itself far too seriously to overlook its embarrassingly blatant shortcomings (Forrest Gump got away with them more successfully).  Spoofs like Austin Powers get plenty of slack from me.  Not this film.One funny note -- Palmer Joss' never-ending sudden appearances out of nowhere, all over the planet at a moment's notice, reminded me of someone, but it took awhile to place him...Dungeonmaster, from the old Dungeons & Dragons cartoon (1983).

480,JuggleG,Contact provokes thought.,10,2 April 1999,"For me, this movie cannot merely be classified as a Sci-fi film, it's much deeper than that.  I see it as an exploration, not only into the depths of space, but also into the depths of human religion and the science that compliments or confronts it.  Through Ellie, it chronicles the individual's personal spiritual odyssey, an evolution and maturation.  At the same time, it shows us our place in the Universe and presents possibilities of a far-reaching and awe inspiring reality.  Contact provokes thought.So essentially, my love for this film emanates from the fact that it encourages you to think.  (I would say ""makes you think"", however, there are those who can't be ""made"" to.)  Of course there are different levels at which this film's contents can be thought through and analyzed.  On one level it may cause you to realize things about the world you never saw before;  question long held religious beliefs, causing them to change or become affirmed.  It may turn your brain on to the wonders of space and you may ponder the possibility of intelligent life elsewhere in the Universe. On a deeper level, it may turn on your soul to the inherent awe inspiring beauty of the cosmos and your own place in it's vastness- opening your spirit and finding your connection to a greater energy.Like a good book, this movie is interpreted and experienced in different ways by different people; but I think on all levels this is a wonderfully engaging movie that plays on human emotions by capturing imagination.  At the center of it all we find Jodie Foster, who I feel, plays a major part in what makes this movie so wonderful.  She portrays Eleanor Arroway with the perfect blend of a scientific mind and a longing, lonely heart.  She truly did an exceptional job, doing justice to the deep character Sagan created, and I literally cannot envision Contact with any other actress.Again, as I've said, this movie, its characters, situations, and deeper meaning can be pondered and analyzed for many conclusions on multiple levels.  For instance, the role of Palmer Joss can be thought of as representing religious faith, with Ellie representing scientific questioning.  These two entities can, at times, be so far apart, each seeing the world from an opposite context.  However, in one of the wonders and perfections of the world, these critically different entities can come together in a union of thought and emotion, science and spirituality, by seeking to understand the other point of view and creating the beautiful possibility of mutual acceptance.I could go on and on about my further thoughts on Contact (but don't worry, I won't!), for the fact is, if you like a movie experience- not just movie viewing- this film will engage you.  There is so much Contact has to offer, its brilliant blend of an incredible story, convincing screenplay, thought out directing, and perfect casting, makes for an unforgettable movie experience- that is, if you let it.  Not everyone finds so much depth and inspiration in Contact as I do, therefore, I continue to believe that a movie is what you make of it.  But I promise, if you open yourself up to wonder, let yourself succumb to awe, and place yourself in the context of the Cosmos, you can get more than you ever expected out of this film.

She plays a woman who is driven to find life in outerspace. Raised by her father, Ellie, learns to be interested in space and astronomy.

CONTACT is a movie that is intelligent, but poses questions that government, religion, and closed minded people don't wish to ask.

In essence, he said, that true science and true religion both seek the same thing  . . . truth. The cast was superb and under Bob Zemaikis' direction, this movie will go down as a sci-fi classic.  As Carl Sagan's story tells us that it is even MORE possible to get into space and around time by riding the electro-magnetic waves, rather than by our nowadays method of flying on a bomb into space.

All are truly great films that show us aliens that are more human and realistic than the aliens from films like ""Independence Day"" and ""The Astronaut's Wife"" where all the aliens seem to want to do is destroy every new life form they meet. Which poses this question, why would they waste their time on us?  Surely a race of beings who have conquered interstellar travel, would not see us as a legitimate threat.  But then again, maybe they don't think as clearly as perhaps they once used to.In the opening shot of the film, we are blessed with one of the great curtain-opening shots in film history.  A remarkable pullback that starts at Earth, pulls back through the outer reaches of our universe, and gradually changes into the eye of our main character Ellie Arroway.  This shot is a great summation of how movies can have a size as immense as the universe, and still be heartfelt and intimate at the same time.Ellie played by Jodie Foster is a scientist who spends her time listening to radio waves from deep space.  One night as she is listening to these, a clear signal comes through.  It turns out that after all this time that we have been sending out information across the galaxy, someone has heard us and responded.  As it turns out the message from space comes with instructions to build a machine.  But what does the machine do?  Is it a security risk to build it?  Eventually it is believed that the machine is possibly a transport to another world, but the catch is, only one person may go.  And this begins a debate between science and religion.  Did the message in fact come from God?  Should our first ambassador be a man of God, or a man of science?  The film deals with these questions, and gives honest answers on both sides of the argument, and it does so with an intelligence that is rarely seen in the movies these days.I won't spoil the ending, for it simply has to be seen to be believed. But I would like to congratulate everyone who was involved with the making of this film.  From Robert Zemeckis' incredible direction, to Alan Silvestri's breathtaking score, to the wonderful performances of Jodie Foster, Matthew McConaughey, James Woods, and David Morse.

I didn't know what exactly to expect from Jodie Foster's performance since I saw ""Nell"" just before I saw this - and the whole ""chicka-pa"" thing tried to invade my mind.  Nevertheless her performance was incredible and tantalizingly real.  The emotion between her and the other characters is palpable even when she doesn't speak.  She really should work with Zemeckis more often.  A previous commenter mentioned the whole running towards the mirror scene- I thought this was a bit out of place, but it was Kubrickish and I'm a big Kubrick fan.  With a plot such as this one, it's very hard to have an ending that isn't cheesy (Jody lives forever with the aliens) or disappointing (she dies or something) but this story brings about an incredible and thoughtful closure that requires a second viewing to fully understand.  Oh yeah and before I forget the CGI is just amazing.  A bit reminiscent of stargate, but incredible none the less.  You have to watch the whole sequence again to see all the minute details and stuff.  This was one of my favorite movies of all time.

493,pvthur,1000 word limit,1,20 December 2006,"I loved the book 'Contact,' but was very disappointed by the film. In my first, unpublished, attempt at a critique I found myself getting mired in a scene-by-scene breakdown. I soon realized this was like trying to escape a pool of quicksand, too many problems, and too little time to solve them before being pulled under.Then I thought, no, this film has much bigger problems than logistical screw-ups, namely the obvious religiosity of the producers. (White Flag, 20 Dec. 2006. If you would like to read this comment, please ask.) But if I couldn't free myself from a pool of quicksand, what chance did I have against an ocean? I have since discovered a version of the 'Contact' script dated September 8, 1995, credited to Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan, among others. This script is essentially what appeared on film.So I guess I can no longer pin all my dislike on the director/producers. It pains me to say this, but my problem with this movie is Carl Sagan. Let me add that this is in no way a personal attack. Just trying' to figure it all out.Many artists have difficulty translating their work from one medium into another. If you enjoy reading Sagan's books you know this guy simply could not touch lightly on any subject. It just wasn't in him. He had to explore everything inside and out and three days from backwards. Of course he had to make certain concessions for the popular media, but he always managed to do so with clarity and effectiveness. In the bookish freedom from practical constraints on length he could be concise in message. In book form Sagan was finite, yet unbounded.Film, however, is a very different animal. Extraordinary films require extraordinary screenplays. The screenplay format forces you to do one of two things: write a condensed book, or write a movie. A screenplay is its own species, related to a book in DNA only. Where the book is the fossil, the screenplay is its living, animated descendant.I think the screenplay, as a process, was fundamentally at odds with Carl Sagan. The physical limitation of a hundred and twenty pages must have felt suffocating to him. He couldn't fit that big brain of his into that small a space. So instead of translating his work into film by penetrating its internal bureaucracy, Sagan simply gutted it.He touched on the religion v. science conflict too lightly and with no rebuttal. He removed most of the dramatic potential by simplifying Ellie's family structure. He took out all the good stuff: the wit, the skepticism, the cosmic perspective, and worst of all, the conclusion.The inescapable irony is that Sagan probably would have been much more comfortable writing 'Contact' as a television mini-series as it was originally conceived by he and Francis Ford Coppola. It could have been ten hours long. It could have been another 'Cosmos,' and me and a hundred million other people would have loved every minute of it. (This in no way condones Coppola's despicable attempt to halt production on 'Contact' immediately after Sagan's death.) Of course Sagan was not a filmmaker. The filmmakers, however, are filmmakers, and they should have known better. They made a film based not upon Sagan's wonderful book, but on his wholly inadequate screenplay, which in my view amounts to culpable negligence.",Contact

495,cyre,A fantastic piece of real Sci-fi.,10,5 March 2004,"I thought they didn't make real Sci-fi in Hollywood. After seeing Star Wars, Alien, Predator, and later, Admageddon, Independence day etc etc. I've gotten the impression that they only make these kinds of ""sci-fi"" films in Hollywood. The no-brainers as i like to call them. They are really all about the ""fiction"" side of ""science fiction"". Of course you can't really blame the film makers since they make movies that the general public likes and right now, it seems to enjoy these no-brainers. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying i'm a great intellectual or anything, i just don't share the opinion that a good sci-fi film needs to have large explosions, aggressive aliens, people getting killed by colorful beams etc etc.
**Spoilers***The Contact is something completely different. It's belongs to the the ever diminishing group of sci-fi with brains. Because of this. It's very understandable that it gets negative feedback from the friends of no-brainer sci-fi. Actually i find it quite funny how many people have criticized the ending of Contact, saying that they were disappointed when they didn't see how the aliens looked like. I think that was one of the least important things in this movie. Still, i would've been disappointed if there had been some green alien with tentacles or one of those little grey Roswell aliens. Instead, they made an excellent choice and didn't show us the aliens at all. Really good and brave decision. In my opinion, if you were disappointed when you didn't see aliens, you didn't really understand this movie.The religion vs. science setting is really interesting and realistic. It's fits extremely well to modern day life and i have never seen it done better in any film. The best thing about it is that the film doesn't take sides. It just portrays both of them and leaves the decision to the viewer.
Another important thing in the movie is realism. One very impressive scene, in particular, comes to mind. Ellie is in a car, going through the crowds after the signals had been received and picture of Hitler been discovered in it. The nazis are saluting Hitler, new age fanatics are saying that UFOs are coming, some religious groups think that Jesus is returning etc. That scene really gave me goosebumps. That's exactly how people would react if something like that happened in real life.I didn't intend to write yet another review, and i won't. I'll just say that this movie is really really good. They've done a great job at filming Carl Sagan's classic book. If you want to see a really thought provoking, well balanced sci-fi film, not just another one where Bruce Willis saves the planet at last moment, watch The Contact.

498,bradley-81,"Hands-down, the best sci-fi film of the 1990s",10,16 November 2008,"To accurately and honestly review science-fiction, you must recall what science-fiction IS: namely, a story that develops from what is scientifically possible, not IMpossible. (The latter would be science-fantasy.) ""Contact,"" derived from the novel of the same name by Carl Sagan, conjectures one possible scenario of how a first-contact with extraterrestrials might develop. Sagan's original story is entirely based upon hard science and is devoid of the sorts of fantastic elements that characterize 98% of the ""science-fiction"" genre these days. Given this, Zemeckis' delivery of a story that is true to Sagan's original AND that represents a plausible, scientifically based story is extraordinary. Most directors cannot handle genuine science fiction, either because they must reconcile the story to the science, and/or because they refuse to yoke their creative muse in any way to the real world--it's much easier to make everything up. In addition to delivering a bona fide, sic-fi landmark film, ""Contact"" also thematically engages the viewer--an experience that is missing from almost every science- fiction/fantasy film produced these days. To my way of thinking, there are only five sci-films films that have ever fully engaged audiences in a thematic sense: ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951 version) ""Forbidden Planet,"" ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" ""Solaris"" (1972 version) and ""Contact."" A sci-fi film of this caliber comes along about every ten years or so...if we're lucky. Meanwhile, it's sad that so many critics derided this film, largely because they compared it to films within the fantasy genre. Most likely, ""Contact"" will ride out the bad reviews and be vindicated in the long haul as a very superior work.Zemeckis' one and only flaw in the making of this film was his digital integration of President Bill Clinton archival footage (""the president"") with the actors; Zemeckis should be dragged through the streets by wild horses for this infraction. What was he thinking...?! It dates what is otherwise a timeless storyline. This aside, the film is chock-full of wonderment and leaves the viewer with a sense of having shared in something profound and deep. Acting is superb throughout, full of pathos and energy. Even Jodie Foster, who--true to her history- -overacts again in this film, gets off scot-free because it accords with the passionate, driven character of the geeky protagonist, Elleanor Arroway. The digital effects (besides the flawed, ""Forrest Gump""-inspired digital insertions of Bill Clinton) are truly memorable, and ""Contact""'s score by Alan Silvestri is easily one of the best 2-3 film scores of his career.The combined virtues of remaining mostly true to Carl Sagan's novel, cinematic engagement of profound, timeless themes (humanity's relationship to the cosmos, religious versus scientific testament, the nature of belief) and masterful detailing easily make this the finest science-fiction film of the 1990s. No other science-fiction film of that decade even comes close. Meanwhile, science-fantasy fans should look elsewhere.",Contact

504,nanote-997-554224,An intimate journey,10,10 March 2011,"Having seen it, honestly, approx. 130 times, all I can say is that Contact is the most profound and meaningful film I have ever watched. Not the disappointing and generalist ""one of the most"", The Most.I have been a space enthusiast since I was 4, when I first saw ""Cosmos"" on TV and marveled at that spacious spaceship and its only passenger, the talented, slow-paced and guttural Carl Sagan, calmly making all the necessary maneuvers in order to take us to infinity and explaining everything that appeared in that huge window as we traveled across countless nebulae at the speed of light. Since then, I have seen many movies regarding the cosmos, life and its meaning, some of them disappointing and a very few overwhelming (i.e. ""2001 – A Space Odissey"" and, yes, ""2010 - The Year We Make Contact"" also, because the final scene with the monolith standing still on a primeval shore waiting to experiment on the brains of the next ""European guinea pig"" specimen that would come out of that ominous forest/ocean is breathtaking), but Contact added the religious and more intimate stuff, such as love and everyday human issues.I will disregard any technical aspects of the movie, such as goofs and scientific discrepancies because, in my opinion, they don't affect the outcome and its meaning.As Mr. Sagan always successfully accomplished, Contact takes scientific stuff and transforms it into something graspable, easy to understand, explaining everything as if we were a 4 year-old child.There's a phrase spoken at the middle of the movie which for me is in itself a complete paradigm and a way of living life: ""Look, all I'm asking, is for you to just have the tiniest bit of vision. You know, to just sit back for one minute and look at the big picture""Look at the big picture. This movie succeeds exactly at that point. The entire movie shows it all from a perspective that lies beyond human eyes. In fact, from an alien vision. Even the ""alien"" says it when Ellie asks why did they make contact:""You contacted us. We were just listening.""I found myself looking at all the events that happen during the movie as if I were an alien parked outside the Earth lying down on my spacey couch and eating popcorn made of magnesium. The fact of using such a vision credits the meaning implied in the movie. Putting ourselves in that position strips out (almost) entirely our human aspects and makes us think unbiased about what happens to earthlings when they realized they are not alone in the Universe.Along those lines, when the ""alien"" explains Ellie what they think of the human race:""You are an interesting speciescapable of such beautiful dreams, and such terrible nightmaresyou feel so lost, so cut off, only you're not""Ellie's face (a magnificent Jodie Foster) turns from a resolute and skeptic scientist into a lost and vulnerable child, partly because she goes back to being the daughter she once was and partly because she represents our frightened, lost and confused race confronted with a more advanced and wise entity.Apart from the obviously dazzling special effects, the performances are almost perfect, starting with Jodie Foster and James Woods and ending with Angela Bassett, actress that in my opinion, gives out the least credible and most overacted performance of all.The editing was also superb, with some cuts that add up to the several climaxes that this movie offers (i.e., when the ""02-01-00"" countdown is heard while the shot of each of the pistons releasing the pod into the wormhole produced by the Machine is being shown)The Music. Oh the musicit accompanies every shot so intimately that if your home theater happens to produce sounds only through the middle speaker (the ""voices"" channel), don't even bother watching it YET. Get up immediately, throw that garbage away and go get a new one! :)In the last scene, while Ellie is sitting down at dusk on the edge of a canyon trying to accommodate in her soul the new meaning and purpose in life given by that experience, a bunch of gentle and delicate sounds drives us to a cross-fade shot of Ellie and thenthe stars, endless, always watching, always shining and an ending film dedication to a man that, from the very beginning, opened my mind and marked my spirit forever.Goosebumps!",Contact

521,smaug_imdb,How to reason religion for the '90s,6,25 November 1998,"Let's start by saying, I enjoyed Contact and although I will be criticizing the movie here my overall impression remains a fairly good one.The movie begins very well introducing the characters, for the most part, completely.  The first moment at which maybe I stepped slightly back from the film was that when Palmer was introduced.  It seemed that his character was intended to be some sort of 'all knowing' advisor and he is sustained in this way throughout the film.The build-up and release of suspense to and during the first detection of the signal is excellent and I was preparing myself for a very thought provoking movie to continue the almost flawless beginning.  Unfortunately at this point I was somewhat disappointed.  Suddenly a character (Hadden) is introduced who seems like he's been plucked straight out of a James Bond movie.  From this point onwards the movie becomes less believable.Increasingly throughout I felt that Ellie's relationship with Palmer was implausible and that their two completely conflicting backgrounds could have been better argued.  I don't believe that Jody Foster's character was intended to be as weak hearted as she acted.The middle of the movie contains your usual combination of 'step back and see what the rest of the world is doing' scenes and the somewhat loose development of Ellie and Palmers relationship.  This leads to the second focus point - the construction and use of the machine.The end of Ellies journey, I feel, although far better than the kind of 'tentacled alien monster' story which it could have turned into, answered too many questions.  The special effects on the other hand were fantastic.The religious / spiritual untertones in the film came to their conclusion in the final few minutes when Ellie states that she has experienced something which has changed her forever, but which she can't prove (I forget the exact quote).  This makes a perfect analogy with Palmers similar statement earlier on in the movie when he is explaining why he preaches hence my summary 'how to reason religion for the 90s'.  I felt the argument used all the time in religion / science debates 'Science can't proove everything so this makes religion more plausible' being reiterated when the movie could have taken a new and unique perspective.A few quite severe plot flaws added to my disbelief towards the end of the movie also.  For example - How would Hadden ever have created the plans for creating a machine like the one shown genius or not?Summarising, I thought that the movie constructed in the first third, far more potential for itself than it fulfilled, and rather than dealing with the question it asked, it avoided it.

The second I left the movie theater I went to Barnes and Noble and bought the book and the next day I saw it again.  Once I finished the book I was utterly disappointed in the movie.  Don't get me wrong, the movie was great but the makers twisted around too many of Carl Sagan's values that are shown in the book Contact and in other books of his.  For example, at the end of the movie when Ellie is leaving the inquiry, people are outside holding banners saying that they believe Ellie actually went on a trip.  They believe her on FAITH!!!  This is exactly what Carl was fighting against, believing anything on faith.  In the book, Ellie doesn't tell anyone (except Joss) about her trip until she has evidence to support her claim.  For that and other similar reasons I knocked the rating down one notch.  Other than that and a few other discrepancies I enjoyed the movie greatly.",Contact

It is a fabulously balanced concoction of thrills, suspense, action, politics, acting & characterization, awe, and...(ahem)...INTELLIGENCE! (And not just the alien kind!)Some have compared this movie to 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY...with, perhaps, some justification. There certainly are more than just passing similarities. However, whereas 2001 relied on hardware to (almost) the exclusion of all else and placed a greater emphasis on ""spectacle"", CONTACT strives for more substance on the human and sociological level. It touches one's emotions in a way that most movies never attempt to, much less succeed. In this, CONTACT could just as well be compared to Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, E.T. But whereas E.T. was meant to wake up the ""child"" in us, CONTACT succeeds in waking us to the next level!

529,luap-2,My most favorite movie of all time.,10,22 November 1998,"This is my most favorite movie for many reasons.  Solid, realistic acting is one of the main contributions - the CNN and various real-life reporters made everything seem more real.  Like a real-life event just waiting to happen. The effect it has on the people of the earth as they portray it is very realistic to what really would happen as well, and all the science reasoning behind it and everything else you can think of is very realistic and to the point.  There's also breath-taking acting done by Foster and the many others that accompany her.  Foster is such a remarkably flexible actress and her character is developed wonderfully by the story-line.  The heart-stopping suspense and tear-jerking drama her character and the overall effect the movie can create is unbelievable.  It's so emotional and real, and the drama and sadness of it all is extremely moving to the soul.  I love the special effects which only are used alongside to enhance the story and events, not overlay it.  And I could spend days discussing the many intertwining meanings and how they can be slightly different for each person who watches it.  All the threads tie together in a complex idea that is really a million complex ideas in one, all waiting for you to reveal what they mean to you. This is practically the only movie I've seen that effectively combines deep and complex meaning, story line, plot, characters, special effects, and all the other elements into one cohesive and harmonious whole that leaves a satisfactory and lasting impression on your mind and in your soul.

Mac-what's his name was pompous and boring, his role as a spiritual advisor was wholly unbelievable.  If this guy is supposed to be a 'thoughtful' religious person, that doesn't say much for the movie's view of Christianity! His 'deep philosophical insights' were hilarious!The movie used the same, worn-out 'reality' techniques of showing 'real' CNN newscasts, morphing president Clinton, Larry King, etc...like Armageddon and ID4.  The purpose, I assume, is to generate this pulling-us-together, patriotic momentum.  I just ended up getting tired of it...it was fluff that wasted vast portions of the movie.The borrowing from the great '2001' was blatant.  But where 2001 is a powerful, unique vision and a great movie, Contact attempted to Hollywoodize a compelling concept--Forrest Gump meets 2001, stock characters and formulaic relationships.

I wouldn't go as far as to call it a spoiler though.Before I saw the movie, I had a general idea of its subject; I tried to imagine what its ending would be like.  I could only think of two possibilities: 1. a Star Trek-like ending, where she would end up interacting with the aliens in various ways, and 2. the movie ending when she leaves Earth, focusing on the importance of the first contact and its political and social implications, rather than on the actual contact with the aliens. But it seems Carl Sagan had a much wilder imagination than myself, and put together one of the best SciFi movies I've seen. The movie showed that you don't need a great deal of special effects to make a good SF movie; you need to touch the human soul, and concentrate on the questions that we ourselves ask.I had a scientific education and asked myself many times the question of where the boundary between science and religion lies; this movie did a great job at making me *think* some more.I totally enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who wants more from a SF movie than space battles; that is, to anyone who was impressed by 2001.",Contact

Surprisingly, I found that the slightly different story in the movie was much better than the book!  To those who feel that Ellie's character had no real development, I  urge you to pay more careful attention next time you watch.  Ellie's character begins to have faith well before the encounter at the end.  She is willing to risk her own life because she has faith that whomever sent the message did not mean to harm mankind.  The relationship between faith and science has never been explored as intelligently and fully in any other movie or book.

As a film buff, I know objectively that I should keep in mind that not everyone likes every movie.  But I can't help but think that the people who do not appreciate this film are probably either too jaded with life to understand it or too pompous to accept the way it touches all of our lives.This film makes no concrete statements about the existence of God or aliens. It does not try to make those types of statements because those statements are antithetical to the themes of the film.  This is not a movie that is supposed to make you believe in God (or as one review I read put it, ""to make you think God is a little green man).  It's supposed to make you think, but moreover its goal is to make you feel.  It applies to all of us because it is about us as a species.  It's not about us as Americans, or men or women; it's about the deep rooted desire we all have to make some kind of sense out of a universe that doesn't give easy answers.I couldn't care less about the effects (although they were amazing).  The only thing I know is that everytime I watch this film, the last shot of Ellie looking up at the stars makes me cry.  Not out of sadness-lots of movies can make you cry out of sadness.  I'm tired of watching deep, dark, depressing films.  Just because something is depressing that does not make it inherently artistic.  It doesn't take much to make a person sad.  It takes a special film to provoke someone to tears of optimism and hope. CONTACT gives me hope for the future of film, as well as hope for just the plain old future.",Contact

Nothing can be further from the truth.  In fact, ""TRUTH"" is what this movie is all about.  The search for ""TRUTH"" -- science's way or religion's way.  The theme of this movie was the vehicle to drive home this long lasting debate.This was Carl Sagan's last stab at the hypocrisy in religion, and religion's anti-science stance.  On the one hand religion wants us to believe in a god without proof, but those very same people demanded evidence of Arroway's trip.  Typical.Everywhere in the movie we see the conflict between religion and science. Once Dr. Arroway finds the evidence, what do the ""believers"" want to do? Militarize it!  Again, a typical approach from the religious side.  If they do not understand it, or it differs from their world view, destroy it! Science just wants to understand it.Another example is who do they send to visit these aliens?  The ""true believer"" to spread the Word!  How many times has human history seen the results of these trips!   One would expect these far more advanced aliens would have dispensed with such believe systems.  You cannot advance to that stage still clinging to antiquated, and superstitious, views of reality.I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and saw it at the theatre 3 times, and have watched the video many times more.

In my opinion, Contact ranks in the top list, along with ""The Matrix"" and ""The End of Evangelion."" So, if you want a mind-blowing experience that takes you to the depths of the mind, watch Contact. It quite literally, changes your aspect of how you view yourself in the comic scheme.

549,arturodelvalle,Very fun satire,6,11 April 2021,"Obviously, this review contains SPOILERS.First, I always wanted to start my first review by saying that I never do reviews, but I had to do this one. Like a character entering a taxi and saying they always wanted to say 'follow that car'.I don't think Robert Zemeckis took this movie seriously, maybe the producers did, and it seems a lot of reviewers and spectators also. But the drama in this film is too sentimental and the plot evolves too ludicrously to be taken straight. But that may not be unintended, as it is fun nevertheless, so who cares.Let's begin with plot and development inconsistencies: they announce having received a message from space and the army, complete with choppers, Hummers and machine guns come to them, to the scientists' base. There are not enemies, only a mysterious audio signal.The US get them an other unspecified countries to invest billions with 'b' in a project that will get them no economic reward in short term, and very probably any at all. And they do it in which seem to be just weeks from briefly discussing the subject in the White House to finally launching. (In reality, space agencies spend months if not years just for a brief trip around Earth.) Doesn't seem strange for them that they can build the whole ship with available materials?The process of selection also makes no sense: instead of run a physical and psychological research among astronauts, they select the best christians among random people close to them in TV broadcasted interviews. And after that, they start with the physical tests.They select an elder man to go to space. The anchor broadcasting the pre-launch test states that no one knows what the machine does, so the people building it and investing a whole lot of money didn't know what they where doing at all. Shortly after, it's made clear the security people also weren't.Then, after the first tests goes awfully wrong, they decide to launch the recently discovered second one in a rush, without any tests. The candidate is not selected this time throught an interview, they simply pick Jodie Foster because she's the star of the film. Then, she angrily refuses to have a suvival kit consisting in some cookies and other snacks with her.In both launchings, they seem to have hired a lot of high qualified scientists to say that everything is normal. In the second one, as it is in Japan, at least they make one of them being Asian.At the end, she is tried by a large and important jury althought she is only sharing her experience, being real or not, but not suing nor she's committed any crime. In the trial, James Woods's characher puts the whole country and some others in evidence by insinuating that everthing was a plot by John Hurt to make her believe, just for make her recognize her error in public.Also: does the White House really have a spiritual counselor?All of those things are just too funny and too satiric to call them plot holes instead of dumbly intelligent jokes.William Fichtner's character is a friend-zoned guy instead of a potential love interest just because he is blind? At least, he appears until the end, contrary to the Hawaiian-shirt-wearing and pipe-smoking duo of actual competent partners of Jodie, who disappear at some point. She, the scientist leader of the project, doesn't even mention them when the government tries to take the project out of their (and not only her) hands and attributes just herself the discovery. Disturbingly accurate, right?Shamefully accurate to reality, and the film acknowledges that, is that the candidates are mostly white Americans (they say a third, which is a lot for only one country), and, of those that we see, only one woman. The interviews to candidates seem to be carried in America by Americans, which adds for partiality in the film, but isn't far from reality.In terms of acting, apart from the flashbacks, Jodie Foster seems to be the only one to take her character seriously, but she plays her wittily as a good hearted lunatic who lives in a world of total lunatics. Jena Malone does a good job looking like a younger version of the idealistic Foster character, and so does David Morse as a tender single father figure.The rest of the cast: John Hurt, James Woods, Tom Skerritt, etc. Is simply having fun with the characters and thus adding for the comedy. Matthew McConaughey is too arrogant in his role. It may have been disgusting for pre-True Detective audiences.Foster's and Woods' characters mutual disrespect is one of the best things, characterwise, here, much more than the unlikely, uninteresting and forced love story.The photography is not a masterpiece, but is great, with beautiful lighting, rich colors, and flawless composition. Take the shot of Jodie Foster in front of her Impala just before discovering the message as an example.There are also some astounding shots, like the unnecessary track shot of Jena Malone running upstairs that surprisingly and seamlessly ends in the mirror. Or Jodie Foster driving angrily towards Tom Skerritt (and a bunch of scared people) to confront him, he undisturbed. The nervous camerawork in moments of tension is not innovative, but is effective.It's a shame bad and unnecesary CGI almost ruined the visual part. There were some great digitally composed shots, mostly in the first hour of the film, like the impressive planet-to-eye opening shot, the aforementioned mirror shot, the travelling out throught the glass window in which Jena Malone tries to contact with her father with the radio, or even the first time where Jodie and Matthew go to see the stars.But most of the CGI is plain bad, like the spaceship itself, its explosion, the floating compass or the awkward beach scene.The commentaries Matthew McConaughey's character makes about technology in modern society are very interesting and feels now (in 2021) more current than ever, which is a rare trait from computer related statements from 90s films.Guess I have to mention the religious question, which actually is to think about, but in the movie it goes largely underdeveloped and shamelessly predictable. For me, is more interesting the commentary the filmmakers make about organized religion and powerful religious leaders having so much prominence in society, in politics, and even, in scientific affairs.But the strong part of the film it's its satire, like the jokes about US centered alien contact in movies, the US Army taking control of something only the scientists know about, the craze that the media makes about those things or the circus the people do about anything, as in the terrifically funny the scene in which she rides thru the 'Vega convention' and sees all the different groups of people who find an excuse to attend such event, including bald neo-nazis and drunken Elvis impersonators equally. The gag of the Chevrolet Vega owners was so unexpected yet so fitting it made me laugh out really loud.They also included a nazi aliens visual joke and got away with it by giving a believable explanation.Of special mention is the scene in which one of the top candidates to the interstellar trip resigns because his kids ask him so: so funnily serious it seems taken from an Adam McKay film.The fact about the countries allying to make an outrageously expensive spaceship just because of curiosity and the US taking control and all the merit is so ridiculous it may happen in reality: Simpson-level clever satire.The plot device of having a secret second spaceship in an island in Japan made unnoticedly by the private company of a crazy rich semivillain (who, by the way, lives in a plane and then moves to space) is not just Bond-esque but a direct homage to ""You Only Live Twice"", and is super funny.Because of that, and because overall, the movie is fun to sit thought, I think is good - not great nor bad, just good.

Contact has a myriad of recognizable support actors that lead to the film being believable.

The movie ends with the main character continuing her research and the government covering up the truth. When will Contact 2 come out? Given the state of affairs in the world right now, it would really be nice to see some meaningful science fiction with a touch of hope in it. There is an unfinished story here. The sequel go in so many directions (e.g. an investigative journalist finds out that the government is keeping a secret; the aliens contact our main character again; our main character is actually a clone, and the real one is still living among the aliens; the aliens visit us; or something simple and profound like the first movie, but that moves beyond the message we are not alone and we are all struggling to answer the big questions). The movie is similar to Mission to Mars for me, since both have humans reaching out to their place in the universe. With Star Gate, Star Trek, etc. no more except in re-runs, and the news in the world right now (terrorism, global warming, etc.), it would be nice to see a sequel to Contact so that we can imagine the world as a better place - it sure would be nice to see a film where humanity takes a step off the earth, stops looking down at the ground, and looks up.",Contact

In his work as an astronomer and through his various commentaries, he came to be seen as a great respecter of fact and enthusiastic seeker of truth, a realist who saw SETI as a valid scientific extension of that hypothesis-based approach. Yet, in the end, the 'science' of Contact proves not to be enough and we are left to believe or to doubt, to have faith in the protagonist and her assertions despite a lack of any conclusive evidence or to chuckle along with the Hirt character.We know the fundamental importance of faith in all things religious but has any vehicle other than this film ever made a more literate argument for the importance of faith in things scientific?""Did your father love you?""

555,clarkfriedgen,Intelligent Science Fiction,9,1 July 2007,"I saw this movie at a then state of the art movie house with surround sound down here in San Diego and I have also watched it several times at home. I don't get tired of watching it and that says a bunch about the quality of the movie.Since so many people have written about the intriguing interplay between science and religion with its hopefulness themes, I thought I would bring up some more of the nuts and bolts aspects of this movie that were mostly great as well.Lets start with film editing and sound editing. That delicate theme song of the 9 year old Elli with were father is literally perfect, and I don't give praise easily. When the scene shifts to present day with the same notes but done in an orchestra setting to emphazise growth and maturity, it flows seamlessly. The night sounds at the Aracebo observatory are beautifully subdued but still noticeable even with the hum of computer fans droning along. More examples of great music and sound are as follows: The heavy sad notes that surround the heart attack scene. They are impactful to the scene but are timed to move on to the next scene of morning in which lots of more subtle sounds are used.Rustling of leaves a quiet moment and and a final short dirge to end it. My overarching theme here is how the director and sound editor let the music be a subtle accent rather then an overpowering guide to the key action or emotional moments. Of course the pulsing violins during the big action scene at the VLA New Mexico is the creme de la creme. It activates a short burst of excitement and just flows perfectly and then cuts out all together when Elli enters the control room. This gives me a sense of believable reality in which the action is carried on by the scientific process of discovery so well acted by Elli's team. Finally the sounds of the machine are completely believable, and peak with the point where the machine reaches its maximum velocity. Then the base music sounds indicating power come in for added impact. The effect is line with which Carl Sagen would have liked, that being complete humbleness around an exponentially advanced technology.I could go into other nuts and bolts but I have to do some other things so I will say that this movie is a very watchable movie. Its just plain great entertainment that asks more intelligent questions then most movies. The action and special effects are first rate as well. Robert Zemeckis is a top talent as far as I'm concerned so I'll keep popping it in the DVD player every few months for another great ride.",Contact

To add further insult, no one discusses the option of rebuilding the transport and trying it again? The end of the movie becomes more of a legal court room drama.

A LOT better.In what is evidently meant (at least at times) to be a philosophical examination of a more or less anthropomorphic concept of God wrapped in a mildly intriguing entertainment, ""Contact"" is so mundane it's laughable. The script is pedantic; something rather like an imaginative British TV miniseries, but from the '70s or '80s rather than the '90s.Like so many science fiction films of the '70s and '80s, the actors' interpersonal interplay is both phony and telegraphic, though the plot offers a nifty shock here and there. But, even though it takes a poke at the Red State hyper-religiosity that elected Junior and his cronies, this is not Ready for Prime Time.It could have been sooooooo much better. Contact could have taken the kind of a look at ""God"" that many of the great philosophers of the last hundred years have taken. (Well. Why not if that's what you're going to do in a film?) We could have looked at the ""God"" Einstein, Fermi, von Neuman and others found in quantum physics. Or it could have at least made mention of Poincare, Lorenz and Gleick and their God of ""Good Orderly Direction"" in ""chaos theory."" Or even at just the Eastern world's notions of ""God"" as something beyond our infantile, Western insistence upon society-organizing parentalism.In whatever event, the pacing is plodding most of the way. Some of this could have been dealt with by means of tighter editing, but like Sagan's own ponderous television series, the script is simply too ""wonderous."" (Although that's probably just fine with Sagan fans.)There's just waaaaay too much fascination with technology, as well as that sort of schizoid, emotionally clueless and oddly disconnected take on human intimacy that informed films of this kind in the '50s and '60s. What is -presented- as dramatic is simply not, until the special effects guys get a hold of a scene. And even then it's more like Roland Emerich's work on ""Independence Day.""

The characters were so three-dimensional, the writing so inspired, the story so unpredictable, that a simple review can not do this justice.My favorite part? When the evil-albino-Fundamentalist-science-hating preacher somehow manages to infiltrate the launching of this historic trillion-dollar mission. We know that he's up to no good because earlier in the film, he's preaching his sneering message of scientific intolerance in the desert, when Jodie's character passes by him and HE CALLS HER OUT (""these scientists.."") when she's driving to get to the tracking station. That was some seriously eerie foreshadowing Robert Z, and it still gives me chills, even as I write this.There were a few other characters that I loved so much that I have memorized their every line to help me with my life. Palmer Joss' words of wisdom about the shapelessness of love has quelled my doubts about the afterlife. The guy floating in space who pays for everything and may be the bald Jesus, was cool, and I liked him a lot although he kind of scared me too. James Woods was also excellent as the government skeptic who wants to control everything because he's got the biggest penis in town. Of course, Jodie Foster hates this guy and their lack of sexual tension (and also with romantic interest Matt McC) is genius storytelling in my opinion. There was also a blind guy who was kind of boring - but he did speak German and helped move the plot along to were it was supposed to go. The black woman was pretty and kept things from getting heated between the scientists and the government. There were also a lot of cameos that made me think at times that this was really happening.Overall, I say watch this and enjoy it, again and again and again.

565,wochowskimike,Watch it on video. Edit out the bias. Watch it for the sci-fi.,3,11 June 2009,"While the sci-fi elements are outstanding (if ultimately dissatisfying) the painful religious bias in Contact really puts in on the 'Don't Bother' list despite the gushing opinions here.Why? In a movie pretending to discuss faith, science and evidence, failing to portray ***one single person*** as having real, beneficial faith in God is a terrible and telling omission. Let me explain. Doubters are portrayed, intolerant 'right wingers' are portrayed, evil murdering preachers are portrayed, atheists are portrayed, free thinkers are portrayed, dedicated scientists are portrayed, manipulative scheming people are portrayed (of course Drumlin fakes his belief in God to get the machine seat). All manner of interesting human characteristics are depicted except one. If you don't see it right away, the despicably pejorative characterization of Ralph Reed leaves it impossible to miss the producers hatred of religious people. Religious faith, in Contact's estimation, only leads to confusion, murderous fanaticism or hypocrisy, which is amusing in a way, as the driven but direction-less Ellie is given a compass by an equally direction-less Palmer. He scuppers her bid for the seat by saying that most humans believe in God, while having no such convictions himself. Poor Ellie has to tell the committee she does not believe. Atheism is thus shown to be honesty, while Drumlin's God references are false and hypocritical. Worse, after unrelentingly disparaging faith for almost two hours, the movie's moral is summed up in Ellie's rebuttal to the stereotypically antagonistic Kitz in the final hearing: Ellie saw and experienced her Vega trip, and as nobody else did, she asks the world to accept it *on faith*!Hollywood is so narrow-minded it's amazing. They must have immutable laws: Hollywood movies can never show married couples enjoying sex, despite the fact that this is common in the real world.

567,thousand_keyblades,Amazing story but flawed characters.,7,29 September 2013,"Contact is an incredible movie that touches upon the intricate subject of both science and religion as well as their somewhat opposing values and beliefs. This notion is clearly depicted in the form of human relationship, particularly speaking, the relationship between Eleanor Arroway and Palmor Joss, a scientist and a priest. Their contrasting beliefs and ideologies together with their shared love for each other shows not only the difference between science and religion but also their similarities. Both Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey did a brilliant job at playing their roles.Overall, it was a delightful experience to watch a fictional story of the event of alien contact.One complaint though, on my part, is that most of the antagonistic elements of the movie such as Drumlin or Kitz, are all depicted as ignorant and arrogant power figures that do nothing more than annoy and constrain the main character, which seems quite stupid in all honesty. In a global effort to make contact with an alien civilization, would such people really go as far as take advantage of an honest and talented scientist, whose discovery has literally altered the course of history, simply for the reason of personal gain? All Drumlin did was finish Arroway's sentences and steal her glory while pretending to be innocent. Same goes for Kitz, all he did was criticize when everything seemed like it went to toilet.These details might seem minor but I feel like they were a bit exaggerated really.

You should just go watch 'Independence Day' again. The dangling threads at the end of this movie are a large part of its message.Contact has always been a guilty pleasure for me, being surrounded by friends who've largely excoriated it for 'woefully misdrawn characters' and 'moronic dialog'. (I disagree with these accusations... for the most part.) But it has a little something for everybody, except maybe hardcore action fans. A little romance, interpersonal relationships and conflicts, political infighting, betrayal, mystery, large- and small-scale special effects... There were nice touches all the way through this movie, including the irony in the plot, that give it a richness you don't usually find in a sci-fi. (The small recurring themes like the crescent, the camera shot where young Ellie's running to get her dad's medicine, etc, show an attention to detail that really adds to the overall experience.) And I appreciated Zemeckis's 'gee-whiz' additions that the book either overlooked or didn't need--the immense size of the machine, the suspense added to the scene where Ellie gets in for the trip and those huge rings start turning... awesome. Bob Z's other trademarks (such as splicing in actual historical figures & TV & news personalities a la Forrest Gump to give it authenticity) are also a treat. The insertion of Clinton into the news clips gave the movie a heightened feeling of immediacy and reality at the time of its release. If you didn't see it at that time this will probably seem jolting and anachronistic. But don't let that stop you from seeing it now! I've watched this one maybe 5 times (one of maybe 3 movies I've seen this many times), and in the later viewings I have cringed a little at some of the overacting, and I thought the 'alien' encounter should have had a little more to it. (In the book this interaction took place over several days.) I also thought James Woods' character cooking up the hoax idea at the end was lame and unnecessary from a plot standpoint. This is why I only gave it 8 stars. But my first viewing (in the theater) still sticks with me as being a moving and thought-provoking experience where I didn't really notice these shortcomings.A lot has already been said here about the philosophical aspects of the movie, but I want to back up what another reviewer said about it being about humanity rather than aliens. This was THE key aspect of the movie and is why you never actually see an alien. It used the idea of alien contact as a mirror for looking at humanity. (All good SF--all good literature, really-- is ultimately about the human condition.) It's the story of one person's journey of self-discovery as well as that of society at large. The way this story scales so well from one individual to all humanity and the way the movie presents these parallel themes is what make it noteworthy.And kudos for keeping the main character a take-no-bullshit woman whose primary attractiveness stems from her intelligence. Something else that's pretty rare in the movies.I think I'm going to watch it again tonight.",Contact
569,robdur5233,by way of review my style is what I was doing when the film came out,7,12 April 2011,"A short time before the film was made I think I was still researching quantum mechanics using my imagination because it is the only free laboratory visual projection of Feynman diagrams in my head that I create to model what I was studying which was quantum gravity and the ability of an accelerated stream of heavy ions confined in a toroid to a circular path and producing and induced mass dilation quantum gravitational field with the increase in pull strength towards the center of the toroid. Due to some letters I wrote to someone over in the UK in which I described this to possibly create a wormhole if you use two of them, at the time of this movie, I was trying to visualized what would happen with three such toroids, could we create a black hole with this, or a more stable wormhole opening. At least they got the time and gravity/mass relationship right as the time dimension is strangely opposed to mass or gravity force field particular warp and bend of the fabric. The eighteen hours of recorded static, recorded in an instant of time at the center of that huge thing in the movie, the dimensional relationship is exactly like that. I was trying to study quantum mechanics, maybe the script writers and Ms. Foster somehow got telempathically linked to my imaginations 3 dimensional mental CAD display parts in my mind or something. I succeeded then in linking with a Ms. Small in the UK in our experiment along those lines. I also speculated that because the notion that black holes are being created all the time, they might pull themselves towards the nearest largest center of mass, the center of our galaxy, which someone proved with adaptive optics. I then concept ed the possibility of using two of those toroids aligned to be able to create a very short finite in length wormhole around a space craft, synchronized with a nano ring molecule accelerated in movement or RPM to the same velocity as the ions in the larger ones in order to maintain the spatial reference framework of the very localized spatial reality of the space craft as it enters the one dimensional conduit of the wormhole it is generating. I discovered and believe this is the only possible faster than light travel system we could use without violating the laws of physics since it utilizes mass dilation in specific manners and ways. I also had to think of ways to power this equipment too. So I am ready to try building a true star ship but it will require careful research's, some in space in orbit or away from the earth. It was discovered that there is a massive black hole at the center of our galaxy and I know that the images that were recorded of a star whipping in a few seconds in orbit around a very heavy unseen thing happened more than sixty thousand years ago and that black hole could have been fed in that time and there could be a huge amount of very deadly radiation that might be coming to intersect our solar systems orbit around the galactic center. If it is, it would literally sterilize the planet and building space craft to take everyone away from the planet until it passes, or digging and starting to live in underground cities might work to protect people from it too, we could take along chromosomes for all other animal and plant life forms from our world, but not living ones except human beings. Think of a large ring world orbiting at geostationary orbit, say some 300 to 500 miles wide flat ribbon huge construction with fusion motors to spin it up for a one gravity inertial centripetal force onto the inner side of the ring, 100 mile tall transparent walls at the sides pointing inward to hold in air and you got a life boat for earth life. What you would make it out of I haven't a clue, except maybe herding asteroids here and smelting them to use as construction material, oh well. It would be nice to license my concepts and ideas for finishing development and manufacturing. That is a topic for another discussion however, all in all a very excellent film, the actors did their jobs, I hated Mr. Woods in the film. I think the NAZI reference was to the human condition of perhaps the dangers of nationalism with regards to the concepts for faster than light machinery I have concept ed and am working on hull designs right now, all just to keep my mind busy trying to figure out safer ways to get into orbit than using dangerous rockets. The Challenger accident hit me pretty hard, I used to build and fly model rockets as a hobby, was offered a job to go work at NASA once.

The film bridges the first two types (in the end Arroway's motivation is driven purely by faith, while Joss' faith reaches beyond religion), while the third type is the one that's really in control of mankind's destiny (the manipulative Drumlin gets the mission initially, while the cold logic of Kitz and co demands they cover up what really happened).Philosophically-wise, the film goes for a kind of expanding and ""exterior"" way of thinking. When Arroway meets the aliens (mind, in the guise of her dead father) they reveal that there are many civilizations in the universe etc but that mankind (in their own words capable of beautiful dreams and horrible nightmares, and always feeling void and alone) must find it's own way and in ""slow moves"". Also, they reveal that ""the only thing that makes the emptiness bearable, is each other"".The film is rather tame and fairly predictable in it's stand. When Arroway meets the aliens, she could be talking to God. Returning to Earth without any solid proof, she doesn't convince about what was essentially a religious experience. The film exhibits this bridging of science and religion with ridiculous amounts of melodrama, in the usual slow-motion emotional-exploitation sequences and mellifluous strings.

It also stars Matthew McConaughey as Palmer Joss, a religious man in search of himself. The movie starts with a young Eleanor. Her father introduces her to astronomy. The movie cuts to an older Eleanor listening to radio waves from the stars. She meets Palmer Joss in Puerto Rico, where he is studying religion and she is working at the Arecibo Observatory. The funding for her project is cut and she leaves Palmer. After months of searching, she receives funding from Hadden Industries. While listening to radio transmissions in New Mexico, she hears a distinct pattern of noise coming from a star. This message carries plans for a transport system. Palmer Joss is now the religious adviser to the president. The machine is built and Eleanor is chosen to travel. She makes the greatest trip of her lifetime. But, was all she experienced a lie? Was she a puppet in what could be one of the greatest hoaxes of all time?The primary message of this film is that everyone has differing views, religions, and opinions. What one person experiences is often drastically different than another person in the same situation. This movie demonstrates how two people with very different views can understand and sympathize with the other. In ""Contact"", theology is openly discussed and debated; something that is not often seen in movies. ""Contact"" is one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time.

It didn't make her mad did it? Sagan, who was Jewish like Asimov, represents the proverbial Jewish man who has abandoned Torah, but is still looking for truth so he takes a New Testament theme and reworks it. Like the New Testament story of Jesus coming to earth, the 'Intelligence' makes contact and sends instructions how to contact 'It' (actually 'Him'). Obviously a type of ""God so loved the world that He sent ...etc.) Without this Divine initiative man (Jodie etc.) would be lost. Of course Christians in this movie are portrayed as wild eyed fanatics ... while Jodie's love interest, a minister himself ameliorates this notion and knows that by the end of the movie she has been 'born again'. One just can't get away from the story of God's redemptive plan. Note that the message received by the 'Intelligence' is an evil one (Adolf Hitler)... it wouldn't have been the only one received would it? ... yet it is the one sent back ... to warm man of the Satanic influence on the earth, also embodied in James Woods character ... the atheistic grand inquisitor who pummels Jodie Foster relentlessly, while knowing that there actually had been 18 hours of static recorded on the tape of the event which appeared to have lasted only moments. The movie is being shown more and more in 2005, obviously since man senses that something awesome actually is about to happen soon. Tsunamis, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, wars (Iran!)... etc, were all prophesied perfectly by the One who actually created the universe that Jodie experienced ... and just think! He walked here on this earth letting us know that He'll be making contact with us very soon. Firstly, He'll rapture away all Born Again Christians, then the earth goes into a 7 year tribulation with the appearance of a false Messiah - the Antichrist who will fool the nations. At the end of the 7 years Jesus returns to fight the battle of Armageddon in victory, saving Israel and reigning as King of Kings and Lord of Lords. Now that's CONTACT. Carl Sagan knows that now whether he is in Sheol-Hades awaiting the Last Judgement (Great White Throne), or if he is in heaven with Jesus, awaiting the arrival of all to-be raptured Christians. What a space trip that will be!",Contact
575,dongyun890830,Isn't this a badly produced scientific Mary Sue fiction?,1,24 March 2016,"Weren't for my paranoia of having to finish a movie that I have started, I would have changed the channel at the second time that Ellie yelled at somebody (I believe it was when she confronted the panel for funding; I was like, ""come on, did she pass her defense like that?!""), or at least the repeating ""I'm ready to go (I muted the TV for some time.)"" It's unbelievably superficial, characters one-dimensional, catering to every stereotype that people have to science, academia, religion and so on so forth. Maybe the only truth about science in this is that it's so hard for scientists to get funded.As what I have seen, the story is about a genius woman scientist, Ellie, graduated from Caltech (not strange if we consider that those people helped bring about Interstellar) with support only from her teammates (all men), especially a nice gentle blind guy, and from a, well, priest(?), fighting (yelling?) her way up to be the first human getting contact with extraterrestrial life. Something really really annoyed me was how Ellie, and people around her, talked about ""truth"" and what is ""right"" in such a definitive way. A normal scientist doesn't really claim a conclusion is a truth, but she claims it's not yet proved the other way. So ""when two theory can equally explain the phenomenon the simpler one tends to be ACCEPTED"" instead of a simple ""right,"" since nobody ever know if a theory is going to be disproved in the future. It seems to me that Ellie simply relied on her faith of what truth is instead of professional standards, such as, peer review. And as long as she yelled about some imagination and global picture, instead of showing evidence and reasoning, ""reasonable"" people were convinced while others were either stupid or villainous. Well, I think that the crew might simply wanted to simplify it so lay people can understand, like lay people are stupid. I also can't believe that one single head-person of national academy of sciences could straightforwardly cut a huge project while its funding was not expired and they did nothing wrong (it could be that I missed something here), just like some socialist bureaucrat. I just don't think academia works that way.There has been enough reviews about how religion was badly intertwined, how the character Palmer was unnecessary, how unreasonable the Vegans are, and how bad the visual effect was. I just want to once more vent my disagreement to how Ellie was portrayed. She was young, beautiful, candid, smart and hardworking, rushing for work, and the only person ever to cling to the truth, even she had no proof. And she didn't even ask to see the footage by person. Ugh. Can't connect with her at all.",Contact

579,vtancredi,"An excellent, thoughtful movie",9,7 March 2005,"This movie examines the premise of what would actually happen if we were to make first contact with aliens, and how that contact would logically happen.The protagonist is loosely based on an actual astronomer named Jill Tartar. She is focused on finding other life almost to the exclusion of all else in her life. When aliens respond to the Earth's first interstellar broadcast, she is caught up in the hysteria. What follows is an interesting observation of humanity rather than any aliens. We learn very little about aliens throughout the movie. Rather, we see how people react to knowledge of this magnitude. The movie examines religious, scientific, military and international reactions to the idea of humanity not being alone. I thought they did a fantastic job of representing the scale of reaction, from the fanatic to the skeptic, within the confines of a 2 hour movie. The movie mixes a thoughtful, sentimental tone with a good pace for action and excellent characterization. There is a somewhat arbitrary love story thrown in, but it is tolerable based on how it helps the protagonist's long-delayed progress towards a deeper understanding of her own humanity.The movie ends in a poignant yet hopeful tone, understanding our human problems but accepting them. I think the message is that the alien contact is the catalyst that will help humanity mature and grow past our more dark halves.If you like the movie I'd recommend the book. It gives much more insight on the aliens, and expands the scope as there are a number of scientists that participate rather than just one from America, and goes more in depth into the science. It also attempts to show that religion and science can get along. My favorite part is at the very end of the book where Sagan shows how God hid a message in the very fabric of the cosmos, that we could only read when we were ready. Be prepared however, the book is quite a bit drier than the movie and those who don't enjoy reading Discover magazine may have to dig in to get through the slower, more scientific parts.",Contact

The climax was written lazily and not very imaginatively and the ending makes it completely pointless. No one wants to see this type of ending particularly after they have paid to see it in theaters.

583,usmanmaqsood,"One of those ""perfect"" films.",9,15 March 2007,"""Contact"", starring Jodie Foster as the brilliant yet conflicted astronomer Ellie Arroway, is a film that deserves a place in any intelligent movie-goer's DVD collection. You do not have to be a fan of science fiction to value the way it addresses the oldest and the single most fundamental question that, at least from the scientific standpoint, still remains a mystery  ""Are we alone in the tremendous void of the universe?"" The film's answer is mystifying and charming.Adapted from the late visionary Carl Sagan's classic novel of the same name, the film addresses the prospect of a contact with a technologically advanced civilization in our galaxy and its impact on humanity, from the eyes of Ellie Arroway, a brilliant Atheist astronomer who against all odds, finds what she has been looking for all her life - a message from an intelligent and advanced extraterrestrial civilization. The film also takes time to address issue of the existence of God  a cherished belief shared by most of humanity in one way or another  and Arroway's contention with the idea due to lack of empirical evidence in its favor. As the extraordinary events unfold, Arroway finds herself facing irony when she is unable to provide empirical evidence of her own claims in the film's melodramatic argumentative climax.""Contact"" is understandably a departure from the book, but the core of the issue dealt with by Sagan in the book remains the basic theme of this film adaptation. The science used in this film is extremely accurate, which will be a delight if you are scientifically inclined.The film has great character development, superb acting, wonderful CGI shots, powerful score, and an amazing story with intellectual undertones. If you are looking for a film that is intelligent as well as entertaining and gripping, Contact is for you.

585,craig_ehlo,I implore you to indulge in the motion picture Contact,10,22 June 2006,"Contact will put your heart through a rusty garbage disposal of truth, then carefully mend the pieces back together with a sewing kit of equal parts wisdom and vision...but only if you allow it to. Let Contact in...don't fight its rich, gooey texture and the commensurate soul searching that awaits you...let it happen and--while you're at it-- learn a little bit about yourself in the process.The hardest hitting--and perhaps subtlest--theme of Contact lies in the complex parallels that exist within the relationships between 'Jodie Foster' and 'Jodie Foster's Inability To Allow For Things To Exist That She Cannot Entirely Control' and 'Men Jodie Foster Wants To Love But Cannot Because Her Father Died When She Was A Child And It Was Arguably Her Fault' (respectively). It's not that Jodie Foster cannot believe in God, it's that she felt that she was ripped off by God when her father died and the ideologies that one must permit to exist within one's soul if one is to believe in God (i.e. that one is not the center of the universe; that all things are not under one's control; that Matthew McConaughey is a risk worth taking; etc.) became impossible to rationalize due to the pain that was allowed to enter into her delicate heart. When Jodie's father died, her willingness to put herself at the mercy of forces external to her died as well; thus, she did the one thing any one person can do when they want to spite God...she became a research scientist. In this position, she could isolate herself from anything that could break her heart, she could meddle in the affairs of the universe and take notes without becoming emotionally involved, she could play with enormous satellite dishes, and, of course, occasionally make quirky comments that made her somewhat-nerdy-yet-somewhat-attractive male research scientists laugh in a bubbly fashion and look at her in a non-threateningly sexual way that would momentarily quell her desire to feel like a Sexually Enticing Woman, yet never let things get to the point where she would have to deal with the emotional side of things (her voracious-yet-emotionally-void lay with McConaughey touches on similar themes).In Contact, the mysteries of the heart and the universe hit close enough to home that it leads a majority of viewers to take the easy way out and analyze the more easily accessible and fancy-free SCI-FI Adventure subplots of the film (or ""Are we alone"" (and so forth)). To truly palpate the chewy nougat of human feeling that lies at the core of this epic film, one must understand the significance of the irony that exists in the very fact that Jodie Foster has been searching in galaxies millions of light years away to find the meaning of her life when all the while it was right inside her, in her heart. At the end of the movie, Jodie Foster still has no hard evidence of the existence of aliens, yet the personal tribulations she endures during the course of the movie allow her to finally understand the power of belief and its very real implications with regard to the state of the human soul in a world where a lack of values and less faith have left most people feeling more alone than anyone ever needs to if they have God in their lives.In closing, the movie Contact left Jodie Foster with a piece of herself that she had unjustly lost a long time ago; it left us as viewers with the peace of mind that one can only find in the awakening in the human soul that occurs when master film-making seeks to teach us a little bit about ourselves that we (again with the irony) already knew.",Contact

The whole idea of being able to build a machine without understanding it is also plain stupid.

Personally I don't think alien civilisation would want to contact us at this moment in our evolution. It's not a question of surviving our technological adolescence - It's more a question of surviving our ridiculous belief(s) adolescence. No person on this planet can prove or disprove the existence of God and the fact that millions of us are willing to attach ourselves to 'blind' faith and (some) kill in the name of it says so much - put simply we are not ready - Until we can collectively address the issue with clear minds we are in no fit state to move forward and a highly evolved alien intellect would know this. Unfortunately I fear it will be many generations down the line before we put away our religious icons and truly open our collective minds. I for one are quite open to the possibility that a higher intelligence put the ingredients in the 'pot' to create our universe, but like everyone else I cannot prove it and would not have the arrogance to preach it to others. Yes I think its likely that higher intelligence exist around the galaxy and beyond, its just possible one of them may be aware of our existence through the premise of the film (electromagnetic broadcast) - but I think there methods of contact or more likely observation would be so sophisticated we wouldn't recognise it.

To make this symbolic pattern even more significant, was at the very end, the only character who gets Ellie's experience was a woman.

Near the end I was amazed that this mega-budget movie with a brain was actually going to have an ambiguous ending. I could not conceive of the notion of a studio picture leaving the audience to decide for itself what actually happened to Jodie Foster in the wormhole.As she walks out of that congressional hearing I could hear myself screaming inside, ""Roll the credits now!""But they didn't. Instead we get that whole unnecessary scene between James Woods and Angela Bassett. Why? For me it marred a masterpiece. This film was for a little over 2 hours the most perceptive story about how disconnected we have become from each other as we become more connected through technology. I was overwhelmed by the intelligent debate between science and faith. And satisfied with an ending that seemed to say you could not have one without the other.Then they just had to throw in that scene. Don't tell me that I have to have faith and then give me the proof! Why ruin the wonderful discussions that this film could have generated about whether or not anything actually happened by giving me the answers in a scene that seemed to be added in to please test audiences?They tried to rescue the ending with that scene of Foster on the cliff looking thoughtful, but all I could think anymore was about that 18 hour video transmission. And would Jodie ever find out about it? Not the way I wanted to leave the theater that day. I agree that this should have been the 2001 for my generation.

594,doomskull,a scientific critique of the film,10,2 November 2005,"The movie ""Contact"" deals with many different aspects of what science is. Our three main characters, Eleanor (Ellie) Arroway, Palmer Joss, and David Drumlin, each have very unique opinions of science. Although each depicts a human character, each represents a different way of looking at science.Ellie Arroway's opinion of science is that the pursuit of science is the search for Truth. She is constantly searching for a higher meaning in life. She herself stated at one point in the movie, ""For as long as I can remember, I've been searching for some reason why we're here"" In her opinion, science is a means for acquiring knowledge and meaning. She uses science as a tool to discover more about our universe, because perhaps if we knew about other intelligent life forms out there, we might gain a little more knowledge about ourselves. She believes that there is no mystery in science, simply gaps in our knowledge, gaps which can be filled by understanding how we came to be.Palmer Joss is a drop-out theology student-turned-White House adviser, a very interesting and all-too-convenient character, always appearing at the right moments. However, he is key in this film because of his beliefs on what science is. Having come from a theological background, we would naturally believe he opposes science, and in the beginning of the movie, it certainly seems so. However, as the plot develops, so does Joss's character, and we realize how truly important his contribution to the movie really is. In the beginning of the movie, Joss says that science hasn't been able to give people the one thing they are most hungry for- meaning. He studies the harmful impact of technology on third-world people. However, he quickly combines his spiritual values with scientific facts and becomes the ultimate counselor to the White House. He brings about a sort of compromise between science and belief. He says at one point that he is not against technology, but rather against people who worship it at the expense of human truth. In short, his belief is that science is the search for truth, and if God is truth, as he believed, then God is technically science.Drumlin was incredibly distinct in his beliefs from Arroway and especially from Joss. He believed that science should be practical and profitable. Science should be practical in the sense that the science that people should practice should only be the kind of science that will advance us as a race and aid in our progress towards helping humanity. This is really what he means by profitable, too; certain sciences should not be practice if they mean pouring money into it and getting little in return. This is really why he opposed SETI. SETI was a project that demanded large sums of money, and he believed we would not get anything from it in return, not in the form of money or progress.Even though each of these vital characters has a distinctive opinion of what science is, they all use the same term for this tool, this system of knowledge, and therefore their opinions, however contrasting they may be, are very similar to each other's. They all have a true passion for knowledge that fuels both science and religion alike.",Contact

Production values are superb as is sound and special effects.You really get the feel that when first contact is made it will be this way and not Next Gen way (although there is nothing wrong with that).Right from the extraordinary opening credits scene to small steps, it has much to commend and even manages to bring in the question of faith.Just goes to show that a good original story can be truthfully made into a really good film.It leaves you wondering and on a cold crisp night looking up and thinking if only one.... had intelligent life....Ultimately, for me it is one of the most intelligent and thoughtful films in the genre.",Contact
