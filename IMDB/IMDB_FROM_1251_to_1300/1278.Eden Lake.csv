0,Leofwine_draca,Ultimately depressing,6,7 July 2016,"EDEN LAKE is another in the recent wake of 'survival horror' movies yet it's nowhere near as good as something like WILDERNESS. That's because the director is so obsessed with conveying a moral message he messes up the film itself, leaving it a suspense-free outing that provides a timely reminder of the horrors of youth culture but doesn't really work as an engaging horror movie. In terms of the morality and the message it conveys I enjoyed it; taboo topics such as knife crime, racism, peer group pressure, gang culture, the murder of innocents, and class divide are scrutinised and it makes for very interesting, if harrowing, viewing. Take the twist ending, for instance, which is horrifying in itself and almost unwatchable, reducing humans to the level of animals.In terms of being a horror film or a thriller, it seems pretty redundant. We've had the 'heroine battling brutes in the woods' theme done to death, and better, in the likes of SEVEREANCE and there's nothing new here. Scenes like the foot impalement are just there for the gross-out pain factor and don't further the plot in any way. There are some stand-out moments – the bit with the Pakistani boy outdoes HOSTEL PART II in terms of sheer outrageousness – and Thomas Turgoose's scene is one of the most harrowing ever. But for the most part this is par for the course, with stupid characters acting unbelievably – 300's Michael Fassbender is stuck with the thankless role of idiotic male lead and wanders around a stranger's house at one moment – and some singularly unpleasant bad guys. There's no entertainment to be found here, just grimness and depravity. I love films where the good guys finally turn the tables on their oppressors – as in HOSTEL, one of my favourites – but here director James Watkins focuses instead on his theme of innocents suffering so there isn't any 'revenge' factor to enjoy.EDEN LAKE is gruelling and unpleasant, but watching it is an oddly detached experience. It just takes place, is over, and you're left wondering why you spent an hour and a half of your life in such depressing company. Depressing is the main description I would use for this one.",Eden Lake
1,Prismark10,The petrified forest,3,14 February 2017,"Eden Lake is a manipulative torture horror flick whose aim is to show broken Britain in the early 21st century. Chav hoodlums running amok and their parents do not give a flying frick because they do not know right from wrong.Kelly Reilly (Jenny) and Michael Fassbender (Steve) are a young couple who are spending a weekend away on the beach where Steve plans to propose. Nearby are a bunch of young thugs led by Jack O'Connell (Brett.) Steve gets into an argument with them over loud music and this escalates where his vehicle gets his tyres punctured and later they get into a scuffle where Brett's vicious dog dies.Of course all this would had been avoided if Steve walked away to another part of the beach, or made a risk assessment that he would not be able to take on six thugs and a dog.The gang hold Steve captive in a forest and inflict pain on him by stabbing him in various places, almost like they were taking part in a gang initiation ceremony. Meanwhile Jenny who has escaped just watches rather than get away and call for help and the gang then pursue her. All the time in typical horror film tropes she does stupid things. She can never get far away from a gang for starters.This is nasty film but it is deliberately nasty. I guess director James Watkins wanted to make his own low budget version of Straw Dogs or A Clockwork Orange without the subtext of the former or the dark humour of the latter.",Eden Lake
2,claudio_carvalho,Cruel and Disturbing,7,3 July 2009,"Stephen Taylor (Michael Fassbender) invites his girlfriend, the kindergarten teacher Jenny (Kelly Reilly), to spend the weekend in Eden Lake, a paradisiacal and remote place in the woods where he used to go in his childhood and that will be flooded sooner; however, his true intention is to propose Jenny. While camping at the lakeshore, they are disturbed by a gang of loathsome boys leaded by the punk Brett (Jack O'Connell). On the next day, the couple realizes that they have been robbed by the young criminals and they are stranded in the woods without their car. While walking through the forest trying to reach the road, Steve and Jenny meet the gang and they are brutally attacked. Steve is captured by the youths while Jenny is seeks a way out of the woods with the criminals chasing her. The cruel and disturbing ""Eden Lake"" is impressively real, reason why I felt very uncomfortable with the wicked and sadistic story. The acting is top-notch, and the violence of the gang contrasts with the beauty of Kelly Reilly and the romantic situation that her sweet character with her boyfriend. The situations lightly recall ""Deliverance"" and ""Red"", but they are so brutal that it is impossible not feeling affected by the horror that Jenny and Steve are submitted. The pessimist conclusion is exaggerated and probably the only flaw in the story especially after the death of the great number of characters. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Sem Saída"" (""No Way Out"")",Eden Lake
3,kosmasp,Logic? Nope,5,29 September 2008,"Or in other words, don't try to think about decisions, events or anything at all that happens in the movie. If you start to question things or try to see if things portrayed here are logical, the movie will be lost (and your enjoyment of it). This is sort of a warning, although if you have watched a few horror movies, by now you will know that most of them aren't really logical.But there still is a fine line between stretching logic and abandon it totally (as seen in this case/movie). I only have to say ""Bluetooth"" ... it just doesn't work the way it is portrayed in the movie. That we get one huge time lapse, when one of out main protagonist should be doing something, but doesn't .. well it's not helping either.Apart from all this negative things, I listed the movie is beautifully shot and edited. There's a real sense of danger and the actors are trying their best with what they have to work with (script and environment). It's a good idea and I like that some things aren't explained and some are shown subtly. All in all, OK then :o)",Eden Lake
4,jboothmillard,Eden Lake,6,7 March 2012,"I noticed the lead actor of this British film, and I was interested to find out it was the debut film from director James Watkins, who gave us The Woman in Black, so I wanted to see what it would be like. Basically escaping on a romantic weekend are nursery school teacher Jenny (Sherlock Holmes's Kelly Reilly) and boyfriend Steve (X-Men: First Class's Michael Fassbender) who arrived at the idyllic remote Eden Lake, surrounded by the woodlands and seemingly deserted. Their peaceful holiday is disturbed however by the arrival of a group of obnoxious and loathsome teenagers, one girl and five boys, and they revel in causing the grown ups irritation and discomfort. Jenny and Steve know they are dealing with thugs when they find their belongings and car have been stolen, and when they go to confront the kids there is a heated argument, and the dog of gang leader Brett (Jack O'Connell) ends up accidentally stabbed. Stranded in the middle of the woods, the couple are forced to run from the now vengeful group of young hoodlums, but they manage to catch Steve, is is bound by barbed wire and gagged to suffer their torture and attacks. Jenny tries to use the mobile phone to get help, but the gang notice this and they chase her again, with their bicycles, and when she gets her chance she goes back for her boyfriend and they hide. Suffering severe blood loss and sure that he is going to die, Steve reveals the ring that he was going to propose marriage with, and his girlfriend takes it while she goes to get help on the road, but she is caught. The couple are put on a fire, which Steve burns to death on, but Jenny manages to get away, hide from the criminals, and she kills Cooper (This Is England's Thomas Turgoose) by stabbing, and Paige (EastEnders' Finn Atkins) by car hit and run, to go and find assistance. Finally, after so many near misses and chases with the teenagers, she finds a party going on, and the people there seem willing to help her go to hospital, but then Jenny notices a photograph of one of the teenagers, and she knows it is a parent's house. In the end, Brett returns home to this house, and the parents and other adults do not let Jenny go, and off screen she suffers horrific torture in the bathroom, while Brett deletes the mobile phone video of their savage attack on Steve. Also starring Attack the Block's Jumayn Hunter as Mark, James Burrows as Harry, EastEnders' Shaun Dooley as Jon, Tom Gill as Ricky, Lorraine Bruce as Tanya, James Gandhi as Adam, Bronson Webb as Reece, Lorraine Stanley as Nat and Rachel Gleeves as Mel. Reilly being the longer survivor is great as the helpless victim who runs in terror and gets dragged in the mud, Fassbender with his time on screen is good as the cool and later suffering boyfriend, and all the young actors as the villains are really convincing. I can agree this is sort of tapping into the ""hoodie"" and street teenager crime culture, and using the standard scary movie middle of the woods setting, whatever your feeling is about young people being essentially the monsters, you cannot deny there are some gripping moments in this distinctive horror thriller. Good!",Eden Lake
5,Woodyanders,Harrowing thriller,8,17 April 2013,"School teacher Jenny (a radiant and appealing performance by the lovely Kelly Reilly) and her boyfriend Steve (a fine and likable portrayal by Michael Fassbender) venture into the deep woods for a romantic getaway at a remote lake. However, said weekend break goes horribly awry when the couple run afoul of a dangerous gang of loutish youths. Writer/director James Watkins takes time to carefully develop the sympathetic main characters, makes excellent use of the gorgeously verdant sylvan setting, and builds plenty of nerve-wracking tension. Moreover, Watkins warrants additional praise not only for bringing a grim, brutal, and nihilistic take-no-prisoners attitude to the unsparingly harsh material, but also for keeping the tight narrative simple and straightforward throughout as well as for having the admirable guts to conclude the movie on a startling downbeat note. The kids who play the hoodlums all do credible work, with Jack O'Connell in particular a real stand-out as vicious ringleader Brett, who bullies his cowed underlings into doing his sadistic bidding. The moments of savage violence pack a ferocious kick to the gut. The fact that the majority of what happens in the story is within the realm of possibility gives the picture an extra chilling impact. The crisp widescreen cinematography by Christopher Ross boasts lots of breathtaking helicopter shots and smooth use of a gliding Steadicam. David Julyan's shuddery score does the spine-tingling trick. A very potent and upsetting shocker.",Eden Lake
6,Tweekums,One of the most gruelling films I've seen for a long time,8,31 May 2012,"When Jenny's boyfriend Steve takes her to spend a weekend camping next to a flooded gravel pit she doesn't expect that they will be plunged into terror. As they drive out of London the programme on the radio talks of the problems of out of control children; a foreshadowing of what is to come. When they get to the lake they find an idyllic beach but it isn't long before their peace is disturbed by a bunch of loutish kids. After a brief confrontation the kids leave but the next day they return and steal the couple's car. They eventually catch up with them and this confrontation is more serious; a knife is pulled and in the struggle Steve grabs the knife and the gangs Rottweiler gets stabbed. From then on things get nasty as Brett, the gang's leader, screams his intention to kill them! They retrieve their car but as they drive away in a panic they crash and Steve is pinned in by the steering wheel; he tells Jenny to go for help but she can't bring herself to leave him and hides nearby. When she sneaks back she finds the gang torturing Steve; Brett goading the rest of them to stab him. What follows is a cat and mouse chase between Jenny and the gang as she tries to rescue Steve and get to safety; constantly being pursued by the children, knowing that they will kill her if they catch her.This is one of the most disturbing films I have seen for a long time; director James Watkins did a brilliant job keeping the tension high from the moment they confront the kids till the end. The terror is increased by the fact that the couple aren't running from a monster; they are running from a group of fairly young children, the sort of group one might see in most towns. Kelly Reilly and Michael Fassbender did great jobs as Jenny and Steve; especially the former as her character gets more and more frightened and more and more filthy and eventually does things she wouldn't have dreamed about a day or two before. The youngsters playing the gang were also impressive; making the viewer believe that they were really capable of such behaviour. This isn't of course for the faint hearted; there were lots of gruelling scenes and I must admit that I had to look away quite a few times. Of course there are a few unbelievably silly decisions made by the couple early on but you have to suspend your disbelief a bit... after all it wouldn't been much of a film if they'd just driven off home after meeting the kids the first time! Without giving details I will say that I wasn't keen on the ending but it did effectively show that the children aren't that different from their parents. If you want to be scared I'd recommend giving this a go; I don't think I'll be watching it again in a hurry though!",Eden Lake
7,BA_Harrison,Hoodie horror!,9,12 December 2011,"I watched Eden Lake last night and now I'm angry.Not because the film was bad (on the contrary, it was very good); not because the nastiest character was called Brett (when surely it's common knowledge that all blokes named Brett are extremely nice); not because I had to watch the film on my portable DVD player while the wife watched 'I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Outta Here!' on the telly; and not because a rather silly ending spoils what might have been an otherwise perfect piece of entertainment.No.... I'm angry because, with Eden Lake, I've been shown the terrifying truth about one of the biggest evils currently plaguing the UK (I'll give you a clue: it likes to wear Burberry and has lousy taste in music!).That's right: I'm talking about Chavs! If, like me, you find that yob culture makes your blood boil, then you too will be absolutely seething by the end of this excellent film, which cleverly taps into the viewer's fury, fear and frustration with loutish teenagers who are free to terrorise the innocent because the law lacks the power to punish them.In Eden Lake, Director James Watkins presents a harrowing fictional account of one such incident in which a couple are subjected to unbelievable pain and humiliation by a gang of nasty young thugs. The sickening atrocities perpetrated by Watkins' lawless delinquents are terrifyingly real (reports on similar real-life events can all-too-often be found in today's tabloids) and serve only too well to highlight just how far our society has sunk in recent years.A taut, well constructed script packed with believable characters and credible dialogue is brilliantly brought to gut-churning life by its novice director, and a superb cast make this film completely compelling, despite the harrowing subject matter. The film's victims, Jenny and Steve, are well played by the gorgeous Kelly Reilly (wow, where has she been hiding?) and Michael Fassbender, but it is the younger cast members who play the Chavs who really impress: they all give thoroughly chilling performances, with Jack O'Connell, as Brett, delivering one of the most memorable and vicious villains ever! If this guy doesn't go on to greater things, then I'll eat his Burberry cap! As I've already mentioned, the film isn't perfect, with a few contrived plot developments and an unfortunate finalé that takes a little too much swallowing, but on the whole, this is one of the most exhilarating, frightening and infuriating (in a good way) horror films to come out of the UK in years.In fact, I enjoyed this one so much, I'll turn a blind eye to the last five minutes when rating it: 8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb.",Eden Lake
8,Coventry,"Visit the British Midlands! They're calm, beautiful  and deeply disturbing!",8,8 September 2009,"Movies with murderous kids and/or youthful thugs running amok aren't a new trend in horror & cult cinema, there's the heavily underrated Spanish masterpiece ""Who Can Kill a Child"" to prove that, but we've certainly seen an increase in such films lately, with the French ""Ils"", the Spanish ""King of the Hill"" and this brutal British smash-in-the-face hit ""Eden Lake"". Regardless of the derivative theme, horror films with kids in the villainous roles are always worth checking out because they remain shocking, disturbing and nightmarish no matter how many you've seen already. ""Eden Lake"" truly excels in terms of sheer brutality, nihilistic atmosphere, complete lack of morality and – above all – depressing climaxes. The plot is nowhere near original or even remotely surprising, but you will nevertheless be sitting on the edge of your seat and biting your nails for almost the entire running time. Even though you can predict every major plot twist several minutes in advance, you will still be shocked when they eventually occur because you secretly kept on hoping it would turn out otherwise. The film is still largely fictional, obviously and thankfully, but the idea is immensely disturbing and much more discomforting than any other survival horror flick I've ever seen, and that even includes genuine classics such as ""Deliverance"" and ""Straw Dogs"". Steve planned to take his girlfriend Jenny up to a forestry green region in the British Midlands, a place that he remembers from his youth as beautiful and peaceful, and even intends to propose to her. Eden Lake is beautiful, all right, but the local youngsters are bored to death, hostile and relentless. A gang of (barely) 15-year-olds, led by the intimidating Brett, harass and provoke the couple and they even steal Steve's car to go out joyriding. After a banal conflict resulting in the death of Brett's aggressive Rottweiler, pester escalates into pure terror and the kids turn into merciless killers. Isolated from civilization, Jenny and Steve try and escape from the newest generation of British nihilistic little psychopaths. Writer/director James Watkins – what a debut! – slyly attempts to process a good portion of social criticism into his screenplay, particularly about the pauperizing of British youth and their continuously decreasing interest in education, culture or sports. The gang in ""Eden Lake"" literally just scrounges around the lake, killing time listening to loud music, smoking joints and torturing small animals. The confrontation with strangers ""invading"" their turf was all they needed to become real criminals. ""Eden Lake"" is extremely violent and sadistic, but definitely not gratuitous or tasteless. The body count is still rather low, as the film predominantly relies on slow-brooding edginess and a couple of truly bleak moments that slap you in the face. The acting performances are highly admirable, with a specific word of praise for the young gang members, and Watkins makes stupendous full use of his marvelously chosen Midlands setting. As I can also derive from the comments of my fellow die-hard horror fanatics, this is a film that manages to impress even the most hardened fans of the genre. A must-see, if you can stomach it.",Eden Lake
9,michaelRokeefe,"Best horror flick from the UK in a long, long time.",8,30 April 2014,"It has been a while, but this has to be the best horror film out of the UK in a long time. Written and directed by James Watkins, EDEN LAKE will have you cringing and at the edge of your seat. What was to be a calm lake getaway will not be what Steve(Michael Fassbender)and Jenny(Kelly Reilly)had in mind at all. Steve was hoping to slip an engagement ring her finger and dream of a blissful future. Eden Lake is a beautiful setting for a little peace and calm. You drive through the woods and there close to a construction site is serenity. But not in the plans is the commotion of a small pillaging and murderous gang of young teen hooligans. The psychotic leader is Brett(Jack O'Connell), forcing his little group of minions to do whatever he wishes. The group steals Steve's car, leaving the couple stranded and ripe to be victimized by the gang. Steve, beaten severely and near death, watches Jenny flee for help on foot. She must summon the strength and fortitude to get away from the vicious attackers that outnumber her.There is pretty scenery, but then there also is the disturbing images of brutal violence. Plenty of pervasive language and glimpses of nudity. Plan on having the hair on the back of your neck rise as this thriller of suspense and horrid savagery plays out. Do not expect a typical finale. Reilly is outstanding and has the ability to drag out some dark emotions. Also in the cast: Tara Ellis, Tom Gill, Fin Atkins, James Burrows and Thomas Turgoose.",Eden Lake
10,hitchcockthelegend,Sometimes the monsters are all too close to home.,10,26 January 2009,"Jenny and her boyfriend Steve take trip out to a remote lake for a romantic weekend. Once there they relax on the waterfront only to have their idyllic peace shattered by a group of unruly youths. Steve, who has reasons for wanting this to be the perfect weekend, approaches the youths with a polite request for them to tone down their behaviour, what he gets is pure ignorant hostility, but it is merely the start of what will become terror unbound.Eden Lake quite literally could have come from the pages of the tabloid newspapers that land on the doorsteps daily of millions of homes in Great Britain. Such is the state that the British Isles has got itself into with the youth of today, Eden Lake may well be an exploitation picture, but it's also one of the most astutely tuned into the times films to have come out of Britain for many a year. Interesting that writer/director James Watkins has said that he wrote Eden Lake long before the depressing number of incidents involving knife crimes started making front page news, but what he has failed to mention is that the incidents, and the unruly violence perpetrated by Britain's youth, has been escalating since the early 1990s. So with that, it actually makes Watkins film a critically cautionary tale about bad parenting and class hatred, this in spite of some foolish British critics claiming that Eden Lake is merely fuelling generation wars, no it isn't! It's just not sticking its head in the sand is all.Anyway, the film is excellent, the sub-genre that encompasses your every day folk coming under attack from the unruly is hardly a new thing, think Straw Dogs, Hills Have Eyes, Deliverance, Them and etc, but Eden Lake manages to homage the best of those influences whilst adding impetus with gritty realism and darkly disturbing acts of violence. Kelly Reilly and Michael Fassbender are Jenny and Steve respectively, both actors are tremendous and thankfully it looks like both of them wont be short of work in the next few years. But really it's with the young actors that Eden Lake leaves it's indelible mark. Shane Meadows muse Thomas Turgoose {This Is England & Somers Town} plays, what's for him, a restrained role, but it's highly effective, yet ultimately all in the piece play second string to Jack O'Connell {also This Is England} as Brett, a horror creation {reality} that outstrips the Krueger's and Ghost Face's of this cinematic world, with O'Connell giving a terrifyingly great performance.Eden Lake is not perfect, the usual exasperations that come with the genre still show their hands, why do that? Why didn't you do this? And on it goes, but really we will all be very very lucky to find a horror picture that ticks every box of the discerning viewer. Also it's fair to say that Eden Lake smacks of being a Descent clone in structure, yes it is {Watkins has interestingly written The Descent: Part 2}, but what is most evident about the parallels between the two great British pictures is that The Descent clearly has fake monsters invading the real people, Eden Lake has real everyday monsters that could well be in your neighbourhood, Brett may even be the kid going out with your daughter, or even be your own undisciplined son.............10/10",Eden Lake
11,jotix100,The backwoods,7,31 October 2011,"A peaceful weekend turns into a nightmare when Steve and Jennie get much more than what they bargained for at the tranquil setting of Eden Lake. Their little excursion seems to have been doomed from the start as they almost had an accident getting to the secluded spot. For these two, not paying attention to the signs posted as they tried to get in, proved to be fatal.Steve and Jenny, having found an idyllic place where they can relax from the pressures in London, were not prepared for the invasion of the gang of local youngsters that will be their tormentors for the following days. Even going through the town, there were indications they were not welcome to trespass their environment. The kids show a total disregard for decency, by leaving the couple have their quality time in their area.Rubbing the gang the wrong way, triggers a reaction neither Steve or Jennie could have predicted. These are not just teenagers looking for a good time, these are terrorists who feel they have the upper hand in a situation they completely have the upper hand. It is impossible to accept their cruelty and disregard for the way their criminal instincts turn them into a pack of animals on a rampage.James Watkins, a British writer, made a terrific debut with this film that is a reflection, no doubt, he has seen in his country. We are sure there are parallels running between what shows up in the screen and what the real intention of Mr. Watkins was. It does not take too much to incite the youths in the picture, but their complete disregard to human suffering, which baffles the mind. There has been other films about cruel behavior by unruly mobs, but the display in the film comes as a total shock because it is not what it is expected from the more sedate English character.Kelly Reilly's performance is one of the best things she was asked to play in her career. It must have taken quite a toll on her going through the emotions she had to do to make her Jennie such a remarkable creation. Michael Fassbender has been getting a lot of serious work. In here he did not have as much to do as Ms. Reilly. Jack O'Connell, who was quite wonderful in ""Harry Brown"" proves he is a young actor to be reckoned with.",Eden Lake
12,Scarecrow-88,Eden Lake,8,11 February 2009,"Freckled, radiant red-head, schoolteacher Jenny(Kelly Reilly, luminous before her life becomes a living hell)and her handsome yuppie boyfriend Steve(Michael Fassbender)take a trip to an idyllic quarry on the verge of being turned into a gated community, who fall prey to a menacing group of local kids, a gang of aggravating brutes with nothing better to do than provoke trouble with this innocent couple, simply wishing to enjoy their camping trip in peace. Their tranquility is shattered when a heated confrontation spirals out of control as the antagonist leader, Brett(Jack O'Connell, always wearing a sneer or growl as he orders his cronies to his bidding)and his goons steal their vehicle and certain items belonging to Steve, the result of an accidental stabbing of a girl dog. This death escalates a traumatizing series of events which lead to Brett and his posse's sadistic torture of Steve after his attempt to drive Jenny to safety results in a crash. Jenny, on her own, must somehow save Steve, get help, and evade Brett and his gang running for her very life in the unfamiliar wilderness of Eden Lake.A survivalist thriller using the ""yuppies in danger"" theme with the kids causing our hearts to flutter and our nerves to quiver. Brett is obviously unhinged, with rage issues that only fuel his egotistical desire to harm. The dog's death only provided a reason for him to inflict damage. I applaud Reilly's physically demanding performance..not just exhausting it must've been to run, run, run, but also to bear the burden of such a tormented soul. The graphic violence is unsettling, particularly when Steve is tortured and a scene where a kid(..the youngest who tried everything he could not to harm Steve)is stabbed in the neck with a shard of glass. Oftentimes, it's the ones pushed into an unwarranted situation who suffer as the real brute is able to get away. James Watkins shoots a lot of from afar, breathtaking aerial photography over the wilderness of Black Park, in England. Once the chase begins, you can barely catch your breath. The ending is debatable. Some will find it hogwash, how it all is carried out, while others will embrace it because it doesn't allow for the usual satisfying ending. Like many enraged viewers, I had to examine myself because, truthfully, I wanted Jenny to drive that truck right over Brett, that loathsome scumbag. The film is actually an examination on how far certain kids have deteriorated morally and psychologically. The lasting image of Brett is quite potent and chilling, leaving a bad taste in your mouth, but it does confront a scary truth..some kids are pure evil and must not be allowed to walk the streets with opportunity to harm innocent people. I think this movie will incite a host of negative feelings, but that's the point..to cull from the viewer a feeling of disbelief and anger at injustice.",Eden Lake
13,Hey_Sweden,An intense tale of wayward youth.,7,14 January 2015,"""Eden Lake"" is a harsh, grim, violent thriller that will likely please people looking for visceral entertainment. It is NOT without flaws, but in general the filmmaking is quite competent and the setting is beautiful enough to contrast with the sadistic goings-on.Kelly Reilly and a pre-stardom Michael Fassbender star as Jenny and Steve, an upscale urban couple looking to have a pleasant getaway in the woods. However, they encounter a pack of surly kids who become extremely unpleasant, especially after the (accidental) death of the main kids' dog.The film puts class differences right up front; it's based on this idea that the more one heads into rural England, the more unkempt and unruly the people get - especially the hoodie wearing generation. The young characters here are truly disturbing. It doesn't take much for their ringleader Brett (an eerily effective Jack O'Connell) to decide that these unwelcome interlopers need to be severely punished for their intrusion into a domain other than their own.One can't always feel a lot of sympathy for our protagonists, because they don't act all that sensibly. Steve can not only not leave well enough alone, but he goes so far as to enter a home, uninvited, to have it out with our youthful antagonists. Still, there is something compelling about the way that director James Watkins's script becomes a nightmare that just keeps getting worse. As Jenny and Steve get put through the ringer, the pacing picks up and the situation becomes more hopeless.Among the younger cast members, O'Connell definitely stands out. Reilly is a real trouper, considering the indignities that Jenny must endure.Some of the worst horrors take place off screen, although there is a substantial amount of gore to take in. In this case, however, it doesn't feel all that gratuitous. And the ending fits the tone of the balance of this film.Seven out of 10.",Eden Lake
14,preppy-3,Nothing really new here,5,27 October 2011,"A young likable couple Steve (played by hottie Michael Fassbender) and Jenny (played by attractive Kelly Reilly) go to this lake to enjoy it for one last weekend before they put up a gated community on it. While there they meet a bunch of obnoxious and clearly psychotic kids who proceed to torture the couple.Aside from a few new OK twists and turns in the plot there's nothing different here. I've seen these characters and situations before. Fassbender and Reilly are very good in their roles but not enough to totally save this. To make matters worse the kids all speak with THICK accents and I found much of their dialogue unintelligible (I watched it on cable so I couldn't turn on subtitles).SPOILER!!! The ending was lousy too with the killers getting away with it. However, if you think about it, there's no way that these killers were going to get off. There were numerous dead bodies and WAY too much evidence left to make me believe they were going to get away with it. Even worse the ending was (to me) telegraphed. END SPOILER!!!This got good reviews from critics who usually hate horror films. My guess is they were pleased that it wasn't TOO gruesome (the violence in here is strong but brief) and there was (surprisingly) no gratuitous female nudity. Still the overly familiar story and the unintelligible accents really got to me. I can only give this a 5.",Eden Lake

Stranded in the middle of woodland with no phones or means of escape Jenny & Steve face a fight for their lives...This English production was written & directed by James Watkins & I would say Eden Lake is more of a violent thriller than a straight horror film, there are no mutant monsters or over the top gore set-pieces & seems to be very much grounded in reality as it tries to paint a depressing picture of modern society. The script is obviously trying to make a point about youth crime, the lawlessness & moral decline of a teenage generation which is very topical these days as the whole issue of youth crime is never far from the media headlines, just look at the recent riots here in the UK for instance. As a film I suppose it makes a topical & moral point but unfortunately I felt at the expense of entertainment value, while there's a definite grim reality to it I found it a bit depressing & the downbeat ending didn't help matters. Eden Lake just isn't any fun to watch, it's nothing that hasn't been done before expect with a British setting & it paints a rather depressing picture of our society. At almost 90 odd minutes the pace is alright, it takes a while to really get going & then there's lots of scenes of Jenny tyring to escape with plenty of near misses & close calls before a rather unfortunate & unlucky climax for Jenny. The script spends lots of time trying to flesh the character's out, giving them motivations like peer pressure, parental abuse & the old excuse that they are just children & know no better while some are seen as merely joining in after being bullied & intimidated I can't say I liked anyone in Eden Lake at all. The script also has a few too many instances of people randomly running into each other despite apparently being lost in a huge wood.To it's credit Eden Lake is well made but maybe not quite as violent as some make out, a guy is stabbed a few times & someone is set on fire but otherwise that's about it. The location used is appropriate enough as it at first seems beautiful but soon turns into hell on Earth once things kick off. There are one or two intense scenes & a few moments that might make you angry or depressed but genuine scares are light.Filmed mainly in Black Park in Buckinghamshire here in the UK this has good production values & is well made. The acting is very good, I can't say I liked anyone here but the performances are all good.Eden Lake feels like a backwoods brutality film but very much grounded in a grim reality of feral teenage gangs & youth crime, I can't say it's a terrible film because it isn't but at the same time I can't say I enjoyed it because I didn't.",Eden Lake
17,Bunuel1976,"EDEN LAKE (James Watkins, 2008) **1/2",6,1 April 2010,"As part of my attempt to catch up with recent releases, I have included a handful of well-regarded horror titles; a few of these are foreign efforts, but I opted to begin with this low-budget British production. As I said, it had garnered some good notices – while I readily concede that EDEN LAKE is reasonably proficient in most respects, however, it also has serious problems on other fronts. Basically, the film would like to be a cross between THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE (1974) and WHO CAN KILL A CHILD? (1976) but it falls far short of (and, naturally, is much bloodier than) either! Ironically, in these kind of pictures, the female lead turns out to be of stronger stock than her male counterpart (the same, incidentally, is true of the remarkably similar – if decidedly creepier – French-made THEM [2006], which actually came next in my mini-marathon); with this in mind, many of those involved prove, quite frankly, to be entirely deserving of what is coming to them (including the wimpish hero played by Michael Fassbender of INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS [2009])! Besides, while this makes for a mildly interesting attempt to depict how a banal argument can snowball into a veritable nightmare (and multiple tragedy), the end result is considerably undermined by a plot progression that is both heavy-handed and highly implausible. Typically, the film wallows in nastiness and grime which produces the very opposite effect of what was intended, thus alienating the viewer (not to mention cause hilarity during the scene where the deceitful Arab child is doused in petrol and set aflame by the 'monstrous' kids ostensibly to spite the heroine, when she could not care less about his fate by this point!); likewise, the so-called twist ending is so obvious that it leaves one cold!!",Eden Lake

They are led by a certified psycho (Jack O'Connell), and it turns out to be a cross between Lord of the Flies and Deliverance.Childish pranks soon turn progressively worse.

20,neil-476,Grim but gripping,8,17 September 2008,"Eden Lake is a waterfilled quarry surrounded by woods, soon to be a luxury housing estate. This idyllic haven of bucolic peace and beauty, hidden in the English countryside, is the backdrop for a relaxing weekend during which Steve intends to propose to schoolteacher Jenny. Their romantic weekend is marred by a group of loutish teenagers and, when Steve makes the mistake of asking them to moderate their behaviour (as he points out, if you don't take issue then antisocial behaviour takes over as the norm) things gradually escalate to a nightmarish conclusion.At first glance this movie belongs to a genre which includes Deliverance, The Hills Have Eyes, Wrong Turn, Wolf Creek and so on, where innocents stumble into the hunting grounds of mutants / nutcases / inbred hillbillies etc. However, Eden Lake puts a distinctly contemporary English spin on the formula.by addressing, among other matters, the issues of feral youth, knife culture, and irresponsible parenting.There is one moment when Steve wanders into a seemingly empty house, and you think ""Come on, he wouldn't do that,"" but the actions of the young couple are, for the most part, believable - certainly to a far greater extent than was the case in the recent The Strangers.The descent into anarchy depends heavily on the near-psychopathic ringleader of the gang (and his actions) being credible. Unfortunately he, and they, they are all too credible. In fact, the film as a whole, with the sole exception of Steve's single action - which has no effect on the events of the film and is there solely to illuminate other elements - is frighteningly believable, and the performances of the teenagers are terrifyingly convincing.This film is not a comfortable film in any respect, but it is extremely well made, gripping, and all too plausible.",Eden Lake

Certainly, the storyline allows for a lot to like here, with the endless chasing around in the wilderness, getting scratched and cut up makes for some pretty intense situations, and a realistic series of confrontations in the later half is certainly enjoyable. That also delivers a ton of gore and some pretty brutal moments, which is certainly something to be applauded and the concept of what happens in them is certainly enjoyable. The main problem here is that nothing makes sense as to why it's going down as everyone has faulty motives for continuing onward, including staying around or even provoking the group and it's not really enjoyable to watch them attempt to make them so. That hurts it somewhat, but it's certainly enjoyable enough.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language, Graphic Violence, Brief Male Nudity, violence-against-animals, children-in-jeopardy and drug use.",Eden Lake

23,Wuchakk,"Good movie, but not enjoyable",7,5 May 2013,"...if that makes any sense. ""Eden Lake"" is a survival/horror/thriller from 2008 about an English couple who take a trip to a remote lake that the guy enjoyed when he was young. The lake's going to be turned into a development and he wants to share it with his girlfriend and propose before it's gone forever. Unfortunately, they run into a pack of hellion pubescents and all hell breaks loose.As you can see, the plot is part ""Deliverance"", part ""Last House on the Left"" (2009), part ""I Spit on Your Grave"" (both versions) and part ""Village of the Damned"". Is it as good as these films? It's definitely not as good as the first two and the remake of ""I Spit"", but I guess it depends on your definition of 'good.' The 2009 remake of ""Last House on the Left"" addresses some of the same themes and is both horrifying and thrilling, but it's also ultimately redeeming and life-affirming. You can say the same for ""Deliverance,"" although ""Last House"" is arguably better, a masterpiece, in fact (the 2009 version). Even ""I Spit"" leaves you with a sense of justice served. But ""Eden Lake"" lacks these qualities and just leaves the viewer with a depressing sense of disgust and nigh hopelessness. If this was the goal of the filmmakers then it's definitely a ""good"" film.Yet ""Eden Lake"" is good in other ways too. My wife & I viewed it last night and had a long discussion about it this morning. I understood the pack of kids in the story because I hanged out with a similar pack at the same age and we were almost as bad, although we didn't torture or kill people physically. Like the kids in the film -- we came from dysfunctional families with parents who had largely lost their moral compass with the passing of spiritual devotion. As such, the kids are merely the result of the immoral wasteland we live in.But that's not all we talked about. There are many parts of ""Eden Lake"" that are ripe for interesting discussion. For instance, the guy underestimating the malevolent power of the kids due to their age; and the folly of the couple to obliviously hang around after repeated bad omens.The film is also effective in depicting the female protagonist fleeing in a dazed state of shock -- injured, bloodied and muddied. This was reminiscent of the potent post-rape scenes in ""I Spit on Your Grave."" There are also some parts that don't work so well, like the man roaming freely through a stranger's house. Who in their right mind would do that? Still, ""Eden Lake"" works if you're looking for a horrifying, disgusting film that's a sad commentary on the human condition.I encourage you to read Mark Eremite's 2/5 Star review (on Amazon) to balance out this review.The film was shot in Buckinghamshire, England, and runs 91 minutes.GRADE: B",Eden Lake
24,The_Void,Grisly and upsetting - fantastic modern horror!,6,2 March 2009,"I don't think I'm the only one that has been less than impressed with the bulk of the horror films released in 2008; most of what's on offer could be categorised as either a useless Hostel/Saw clone or yet another remake, and it's disappointing considering the excellent releases earlier in the decade. Eden Lake may not score highly in the originality stakes, but the fact that it's so well done more than makes up for the fact that any serious genre fan is likely to have seen films just like this one before. The plot focuses on a young loved up couple; a primary school teacher and her boyfriend Steve. They decide to go to an old disused quarry for a romantic weekend, but find their idyllic peace disrupted when a group of young thugs begin harassing them. Naturally, the couple won't allow their weekend to be spoiled by a bunch of kids, but as the situation escalates; the couple begin to realise that the youngsters are rather more dangerous than first thought, and their trip soon turns into a nightmare.Eden Lake would be best described as 'survival horror' and works mainly due to the realism. The two characters at the centre of the film are both likable and their actions are always understandable, which makes them easy enough to get on with. When the trouble first starts, it doesn't seem like anything too far out of the ordinary; and the director does a good job of building up to the first problem, before letting things escalate at a steady and exciting pace. One of the things I liked most about the film is the setting. The disused quarry and woods where everything happens is really beautiful and this brilliantly offsets the grisly violence. The violence takes a while to kick in, but that makes it all the more shocking when it does. There's nothing over the top in this film; everything is kept at a reasonable level, but the fact that the director has made us care about the characters and their fates makes the film hard to watch at times. The antagonists are a group of kids and while they at first seem like only a small threat; they do become pretty formidable as the film moves on. Overall, this is a fantastic horror movie that fans of the genre won't want to miss, and it also stands tall as one of the best British films in years! Highly recommended.",Eden Lake
25,trashgang,leave those kids alone,8,22 October 2009,"I leaving more and more the territory of the torture porn, they surely deliver blood, but it's only for the blood. Luckily France came up with the holy three, L'interieur, Martyrs and Frontier(e). But lately I watched movies coming from the good old UK and they are delivering disturbing flicks like this one. Be sure, it's a bit funny not to buy it in the UK? It's cut, only Dimension Extreme delivers the full uncut. The movie starts of with a happy couple were the guy would like to propose to his girl, by doing that he would like to hike at Eden lake. Once on the beach a bunch of aggressive kids. The kids are scum bored with themselves and annoying the couple, of course the guy would like to give the kids a lesson, but that's not a good idea. What happens next is a decay into a scary horror flick. It delivers an all ways, gore, creepiness and makes you think what you would do in such a situation. Due the slow start of the movie you are really into the characters and you will feel pity for them. And the kiddies do act extremely well.

26,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Eden Lake,7,16 January 2009,"When outnumbered, move away. Split. Run.That's the golden rule when confronted by a gang of hooligans, or in the first place, not to kick start any interaction for that matter. Not that one's a coward, but the consequences and the hassle thereafter are never worth it. Swallow that pride and move away, because there's absolutely no shame in doing so. But I guess should one decide to take some action, to never take them on as a group, because crazed peer pressure to belong gives some intense mental strength that clouts morals. Unity is strength, and taking them on individually presents a much better chance at survival.Eden Lake refers to an idyllic scenic though unused quarry area that Steve (Michael Fassbender) brings his girlfriend Jenny (Kelly Reilly) to, in the hope that during their undisturbed stay away from the hustle and bustle, he can pop the question on bended knee and diamond ring. Things don't go according to plan because of a group of local ruffians who disturb their serene environment, and blame should go to the couple as well for unnecessarily stirring up the hornet's nest.Like The Strangers, the couple is (deliberately by their own choosing) alone and kept isolated from the outside world by their perpetrators. For something that should be a romantic outing, it degenerated quickly into petty tit-for-tat action-reaction, before going down the slippery slope into the chasm of what nightmares are made of. The couple is left to fend for themselves, and this is where it goes into some squeamish territory that's not for the faint- hearted.However, it's not like the usual Hollywood run of the mill horror flick, where the gorier it is the better. It's a nice departure thanks to writer-director James Watkins in not going over the top and pile on the gratuitous moments of blood and gore, but to build it up slowly for best results and impact. Sure there's plenty of violence, but the true horror here actually lies in the fact that these heinous crimes are conducted by teens who cannot comprehend the severity of their actions, and worse, the power of peer pressure in compromising any human decency left in them. It takes a sick mind too to be able to order the filming of their act as a form of collateral to keep everyone's mouths shut.It also points to the lack of quality parental upbringing, though it generally made a sweeping statement that rubbish parents give rise to rubbish offspring, given it's in their genes. But alas most of us are for the horror elements and not moral lessons, and like most horror flicks, the characters here do make the wrong moves so much so that you'd like to ask if they too are aware of the obvious common sense pitfalls - Watkins story does lapse into the occasional cliché moment and some none too subtle development dealing with trust.Unfortunately this film was censored at one point, though I believe it wasn't anything substantial to the entire plot. It's a cautionary tale and a perfect reminder to hot headed folks out there that one should never take on odds against your favour, especially when outnumbered, to avoid secluded places, and to know when to cut your losses and make a run for it!",Eden Lake
27,HumanoidOfFlesh,"Brutal,intelligent and effective survival horror about chavs on the loose.",9,6 November 2008,"Kelly Reilly plays Jenny,a primary teacher of small children,who goes goes off camping for the weekend with her boyfriend Steve to the shore of titular Eden Lake.They swim,sunbathe and enjoy the peace of the lake,but not too long.Their fun is spoiled by a bunch of arrogant teenagers playing their music loud and failing to control their Rottweiler.There is evil in mind of these children:they are ready to stab,torture and burn a young couple to death.The escalation of violence quickly turns into bloody fight for survival...Worryingly authentic and very unsettling survival horror with several gut-wrenching moments of total terror.Jenny and Steve behave with complete plausibility and a tragically unrequited sense of kindness and social responsibility.Some scenes of violence are hard-hitting even for true horror fans.The sight of someone bleeding to death from stab wounds is horrifying as is the ringleader's girlfriend recording acts of extreme violence impassively on her mobile phone.People everywhere are capable of barbaric cruelty and ""Eden Lake"" clearly shows that.The film is highly believable and the final twist is extremely bleak and truthful.I can't praise Peter Watkins stunning debut enough.10 out of 10.",Eden Lake
28,Red-Barracuda,A fine bit of hoodiesploitation from the UK,7,27 November 2017,"This British movie is one which tapped into the cycle of visceral and sadistic horror films which were especially popular in the late 2000's. It has to be said though that it's a very well made film with some good performances too. It is about a young couple who go for a romantic getaway by a woodland area called Eden Lake, which is set for destruction in order to make way for a new urban development. This idyllic trip very soon turns into a nightmare when an aggressive gang of teenage hoodies turn up. It begins with obnoxious behaviour, which turns to theft, then violence and ultimately murder. It results in a survivalist scenario, with the female of the couple left to fight for her life in the woods.The long shadow of the seminal 70's shocker Deliverance (1972) can be detected here quite clearly, with the age old story of sophisticated city folks venturing into the domain of brutish locals from out-of-town. It's quite a simplistic idea that some may find offensive but it is played out here to good effect, with the teenage gang being a truly irritating and oafish gang of fools. Admittedly, some are shown to become increasingly reluctant to go down the increasingly violent path that their leader takes them on, so there is some content about peer pressure added to the mix here. But essentially, the reason this one works comes primarily down to its success as a straight-ahead horror movie. There is a pretty clear divide between whom we should root for and who are the antagonists. And there is a good amount of tension generated throughout the picture, with some bloody violence thrown in for good measure. It all winds down ultimately to an ending which was unexpectedly nihilistic. It didn't leave you with a good feeling but it certainly worked to the movie's overall benefit. Eden Lake is definitely a superior example of the kinds of horror movies on the more intense end of the spectrum; it's well delivered and quite memorable.",Eden Lake
29,KineticSeoul,Old school style thriller/slasher flick done right,7,8 February 2012,"This movie had just the right elements to make it a gripping horror movie. It's thrilling for the most part and gruesome without it trying to go overboard and it's believable. Especially since the acting is good, especially when it comes to Micheal Fassbender. Who I liked watching his performances since ""Inglourious Basterds"" and even more after seeing him portray Magneto in ""First Class"". Although his role isn't anything major in this. And the old school aspect for this type of genre works in this movie. The antagonists are some of the most sadistic group of teens. You know those movies where you have no sympathy for the teenagers what so ever? Well this is the epitome of those movies. They look and act like semi-inbreeds that terrorize and there biggest amusement is to watch the suffering of others. Kinda like those immature teens that think they are so much cooler than everyone else. So they constantly look down on others while acting like bunch of terrible and vile people but don't even realize it. Anyways back to the movie, the film did a good job of making very dis-likable and yet believable antagonists. The premise in this movie isn't anything new. A couple goes on a trip to the woods and things go wrong. Yeah it has been done many times but they direction of this movie is what makes this movie gripping and sort of innovative.

What's with Lakes getting such a bloody rap? Lake Placid, (of course) Crystal Lake, the Lake on Naboo and so many more horror films involving lakes, Wolf Creeks and just Open Water in general. And now, the Garden, where it all began: Eden Lake.
This movie was so realistic and frightening, I swore this had to be another one of those true stories about survivors from the wilderness. I have seen my share of those (based on) true stories as well as plenty of bullies and their manipulated buddies. Most of which, were true, as well. So, it's plausible it was a true story. Whelp, it was not.
So, I'm writing this to state how effective this movie was and how much of an impact it had on me. As it began, I thought: here we go again. Couple goes off camping by the title and will get terrorized by some human or plural and it will be a race to get out, hunt or be hunted, etc. What I got was, well that. That specific subgenre of survivalist horror I do favor. What I also got was far better acting, emotions and more gore than I thought this would contain.
Oddly, I found this movie via a spoiler heavy YouTube horror movie review channel. Once I heard 2-3 sentences about this, I fast-forwarded that part of the clip show and watched this following. They were right, but still the movie produced many emotions from me and a huge recommendation as well.

They arrive in a seemingly picturesque little haven of paradise- until some noisy kids start playing their music too loud and allowing their dog to foul next to them. It is this dog that provides the first jump scene in the film- and whose death causes the gang to turn on the middle class couple with murderous rage after Harry commits the heinous crime of trying to reason with them.Eden Lake appeared completely out of nowhere and at first glance appeared to be another sort of American teen slasher flick that would be quickly disposed of. Then I found out what it was actually about and next thing I know it's got a five star review from Chris Tookey in The Daily Mail. I thought, this is one I've got to check out. And I'm glad I did.As the generations grow further apart and the class divide grows even further, bitter, resentful kids living below the poverty line are growing more out of control and less respectful of authority and people's liberty. And their parents, who may have been like them a generation before, are doing little to curb their violent behaviour. EL skillfully crafts a story where two suburban middle class people are thrown into the forefront of this and end up being hounded and chased in a secluded location not by wolves or monsters, but like the kind of kids you see hanging around in the streets all the time, with their bikes as wheels. If this seems far fetched in any way, you should remember the case of Gary Newlove, which highlighted how these disenchanted kids are willing to cross the line if they are crossed in any way. It also skillfully and subtly works into the equation how the uncaring, absent and unaware influence of the parents is having an effect on this, most skillfully shown in a scene close to the beginning where Harry ends up in the house of one of the thugs just as his dad comes home. Or in the cafe where after witnessing some more ferral behaviour, the waitress says 'they're not my kids.' The film ends brilliantly with a grim but great ending that wraps everything up soundly.Eden Lake caught me completely by surprise, and was one of the most pleasantly surprising films of the year, a genuinely creepy tale that also provides some haunting food for thought. ****",Eden Lake
33,bowmanblue,"Horrible, but very effective",7,24 May 2014,"Eden Lake is about a young couple from the south of England, who go camping by none other than 'Eden Lake' in the midlands, as part of a romantic getaway. However, their plans go slightly astray when they run into a bunch of local kids - a situation which quickly descends into a pretty gruesome encounter.There's not too much new in the way of plot, but what I thought elevated it above the normal 'real' horror films (i.e. those without monsters or killer video tapes) is that the two central characters do the things that most sane people would do. In other words, they try to escape, rather than run around in circles like headless chickens.There you have it - a group of youngsters stalks an innocent couple (think 'Deliverance' but with Chavs). If that's your thing, you might like it. It's kind of like one of those 'home invasion' movies (only not at home, obviously) like Funny Games or The Strangers.However, it also (believe it or not) raises a few more questions than your average film of the genre. Some have commented on how it portrays 'middle-class' as 'good' and 'poor' as 'bad,' not to mention a few other shocks and surprises that I won't go into. Perhaps your enjoyment of the film depends on who you empathise with more.

Eden Lake is a similar kind of potboiler in that it only exists to serve itself, the director's resume and further the cast's experience. I don't know if I'd want to have THIS on my filmography but a couple of them (Bronson Webb, Thomas Turgoose) are slumming it with this dredge.Not a bad film by any means, and not a good one by a long shot.

'Eden Lake' is one of the very few films I wish I'd never seen.It's not often you see a film where kids are the perpetrators to this extent. And with good reason. This film is disgusting and sickening to the core. This was beyond nerve wrecking; it was completely and utterly disgusting and incredibly difficult to watch. The acting was indeed very good, but that's the only positive comment from me.The film has the stupidest ending! I guarantee you will be dissatisfied. Sadists might enjoy this disgusting film; I can't imagine anyone else saying they've enjoyed this... An absolute waste of time!Would I watch it again? A resounding NO!!",Eden Lake
36,filipemanuelneto,One of the best films of its kind I've seen.,7,23 August 2020,"This film is another one of those films where an unsuspecting couple, due to a trivial situation, becomes a victim of a mortal, scary and dangerous situation. We have already seen a lot of these, like the films ""You're Next"" or ""The Last House on the Left"", also based on the same premises, but that does not takes away, I think, the merit due to this film that, despite from failures, it manages to give us what it promises: entertainment under tension.The script shows how a couple sees their plans for a romantic weekend, on the shores of a beautiful secluded lake, spoiled by a group of threatening and dangerous teenagers led by a ""wannabe"" psychopath. The story starts well and develops in a crescendo of violence and brutality, and the way the characters present themselves allows us to establish a good empathy with the couple and want to see the punishment of that devilish brats. James Watkins, who signs the direction and the script, was able to do an excellent job and knew how to guide and develop his film in the best way. Its explicitly violent so its inadvisable for children, and even teenagers and young adults should view it with the some precautions. But that does not mean that it is not a good film... in fact, its one of the best films of its kind that I have seen.The excellent performance of the cast was decisive for the quality of the final product. On the one hand we have Kelly Reilly, absolutely convincing in her role and managing not to be histrionic and appear genuine. On the other hand, a huge Michael Fassbender, in one of the first cinema works of his career, opening the doors to higher flights. He was truly authentic and genuine. But the villains were not far behind! Jack O'Connell was scary in the role of leader Brett and Finn Atkins was also excellent and hateful. Unfortunately, the ending manages to disappoint us for not giving us what we want.Technically, it seemed like a regular film, we can even say that it was well done if we take into account the limited budget and the fact that it is an independent film. Cinematography offers us good scenery and an excellent choice of landscapes, in addition to the intelligent use of film drones for aerial view scenes. The costumes and effects also seemed convincing to me, especially that filthy trash can where that character has to hide, which even made me vomit.",Eden Lake
37,TheMovieDiorama,Eden Lake brutally conveys a fragmented society through excessively harrowing ordeals.,6,15 August 2019,"Sometimes, on the odd occasion, I question my own sanity. Having seen this thrilling horror once before, and its staying power never once escaping my fragile mind, I approached a second watch with much trepidation. I mean after all, it's Eden frickin' Lake! One of a handful of films that I would never recommend anyone watching due to its strenuous viewing experience. But, as always, I am one to never turn down a film. And here we are again, an emotionally drained soul trying to claw back a slight inkling of happiness. Suffice to say, Eden Lake is daunting in every sense of the word. A couple journey to a romantic flooded quarry for the weekend where they are terrorised by a group of delinquent teenagers, to which certain actions escalate a relaxing weekend into a game of survival.A contemporaneous yet effective thriller like this was always going to be divisive. You either sit on the bloody side of the fence, completely affected by the relentless nastiness that saps your energy. Or, you comfortably position yourself on the enraged side, angered by the depiction of a segregated society that needlessly targets the working class. After all, this looks to be every middle class couples' worst nightmare. For me, I'm precariously balanced on the middle. Right on the edge, ready to teeter on either side.There is no doubt in my mind that this truly is one of the most effective modern horrors of all time. Whether you like it or not, you cannot dispute the longevity of emotional turmoil that the savagery produces. From setting a peer-pressured kid on fire to multiply stabbing a helpless man strapped to a wooden pole by barbed wire. The eye-wincing gore, although excessive at the best of times, never diluted the brutal intentions of Watkins' agenda. These young ""thugs"" if you like, are depicted with an ounce of humanity, often showing remorse or hesitation between their dastardly actions, allowing us to engage with them on an empathetic level. Particularly when the parents are involved and a brave exploration into parental upbringing takes place.However, Eden Lake remains a dangerous film, providing exaggerated commentary that inadvertently creates fear of an entire class of people. Whether Watkins masqueraded the film to be an incitement on class prejudice or a straightforward horror thriller with no venomous poison in its talons, it still remains threatening. What doesn't help alleviate the brutality of this couple's weekend, played gloriously and earnestly by Reilly and Fassbender, is the film's conclusion. There is absolutely no sense of hope. Everything is lost. The credits roll and you are left to sit there bathing in a pool of sweat and despair. Harnessing the ability to silence all viewers in shock and horror, yet exhuming an aura of unnecessary mean-spirited helplessness. You'll either love it or hate it, that's for sure. And of course, a plethora of clichés originating from the stupidity of certain character actions, especially from the couple where, for example, they refuse to relocate their very moveable camp site for the sake of masculine-driven pride.Still, despite the sheer brutality of Eden Lake, I cannot deny that it doesn't engage. It's incredibly captivating through tight pacing, excessive gore and the wavering of innocence. Just be sure to watch this by yourself and pack some sugary snacks, you'll need the energy...",Eden Lake
38,insomniac_rod,Crude and disturbing. Real and sincere.,10,25 May 2011,"""Eden Lake"" is a brutal display of how modern society is rotten. At some points it feels like elegant exploitation. It's brutality and disturbing factor make it one of the most crude Horror pieces of modern times. The production values are great. The atmosphere is absolutely unsettling.

40,jzappa,A Good Film That Tries To Do Two Things At Once,7,25 March 2009,"Can a film leave us with such a dejecting reaction to its social polemic and concur with the expectations of a fun horror flick? Hopefully, but that doesn't happen here. James Watkins, the writer-director, seems to want to make a movie about perpetuating human violence through its breeding as abuse and the influence of community and family, much in the way Sam Peckinpah's Straw Dogs and Michael Haneke's Code Unknown are commentary on the differences in class and xenophobia contributing to inexplicable explosions of violence. Refusing to let anything spoil their romantic weekend break, a young middle-class couple confront a gang of trailer-trash youths with terrifyingly brutal consequences. However, the film disguises itself in the more marketable genre of the slasher film, and thanks to any expansion of genre expectations, we want to be rewarded. Unlike even the most harrowing of the better horror films, we are not rewarded by Eden Lake.Admittedly though, the film is mightily suspenseful and has an ironic feeling of no-way-out terror within the open clearings and relatively preserved woods that become a labyrinth for its violent humans. Most of the way through, we have mastered the emotional priorities of the story and its characters. We understand and love the couple and we understand and hate their predators. The film is well-paced, and we are absorbed in the remorseless vendettas, but eventually, without giving anything away, we realize the film is the labyrinth with the ironic feeling of no-way-out terror. And it prevails as not so well-remembered on those few and sporadic occasions where you may indeed recall it.",Eden Lake
41,jtindahouse,An unrelenting nightmare,9,19 June 2018,"In the early stages of 'Eden Lake' it can be easy to think to yourself: here we go again! The same old story we've seen a thousand times before. There reaches a point though where you realise that is not actually the case and that what you are watching is something quite special and quite haunting. From that point onwards the film becomes a relentless and brutal ride straight into the depths of despair and loathing. You'll feel unclean after watching this movie.Needless to say this 'Eden Lake' was a lot darker than I anticipated it to be. There were numerous scenes where I kept thinking there was going to be a twist to get them out of this, or they're suddenly going to wake up in a different spot. That was never the case though. This films follows through and I love it for that reason more than any other. This is a film without a conscience and that is what is so good about it. It is certainly not going to be to everyone's liking. Anyone who likes a ""Hollywood"" type film where everything plays out according to formula and everything wraps itself up into a nice little bow are going to be sorely disappointed. This is not a film for those types of people and I think that is terrific. This is a great film that should absolutely be watched immediately if you haven't already seen it.",Eden Lake
42,Stevieboy666,Brutal. Bloody. Brilliant.,9,19 August 2019,"A young couple, very much in love, go for a romantic weekend, camping on the idyllic Eden Lake. But when they cross paths with a gang of vicious, vile teenagers their trip rapidly becomes a desperate fight for survival.
Looking at other reviews Eden Lake certainly is one of those love it or loathe it movies. Well I am firmly in the love camp. This is an unflinchingly nasty, brutal movie. Not a film that that is pleasant to watch, and certainly not suitable as a date movie! But what makes this so compelling is the performances. Michael Fassbender is good as the male half of the couple, and obviously went on to become a Hollywood A-lister. Kelly Reilly is equally as good as his partner. However, for me the standout was Jack O'Connell as Brett, leader of the teens. I have seen thousands of films, mainly horror, and I can honestly say that his character is one of the nastiest, scariest and sadly BELIEVABLE psychopaths ever. What is scariest about Eden Lake is that this really could happen. It's a terrible fact that people are killed by teens for kicks and that knife crime here in Britain is on the rise. Other aspects that make this so good are the locations, overhead camera shots, graphic gore, a number of very tense scenes, a running time that is just right, and of course great direction. In my opinion this is one of the best horror movies of the 21st Century so far.",Eden Lake
43,estebangonzalez10,"Inspired by the 70's horror films, which in turn has now inspired its many remakes",5,19 August 2015,"""Follow the blood!""James Watkins' feature directorial debut is an unsettling and gruesome one in which a young couple decides to escape the hectic city life for a romantic weekend at a remote lake side. The beautiful location will soon contrast with the horrors the couple will face as we get several early warning signs that things aren't going to go exactly as they had planned. From the moment in which Jenny (Kelly Reilly) and Steve (Michael Fassbender) arrive at the town and are pulling up to a local restaurant another vehicle cuts in front of them and steals their parking space. The local people aren't very friendly and there happens to be a group of young adolescents nearby led by Brett (Jack O'Connell) who act very disrespectful towards them. At first Steve and Jenny ignore them because they are here for a romantic and peaceful getaway, but after being provoked by these young kids he stands up to them. The kids are even more disrespectful and pretty soon things begin to escalate and brutal violence ensues. The film reminded me a lot of Alexandre Aja's High Tension for its gruesome violence, and Michael Haneke's Funny Games for its dark depiction of human behavior. Eden Lake is also reminiscent of 70's horror films. There are many brutal and unrelentless scenes that made me feel uncomfortable, but I have to admit that I cared for the characters' wellbeing so I was engaged despite having to turn my face away during some of the torture scenes. The film is well paced and thrilling and the performances are pretty solid, but I can't recommend it because it was just too violent and dark. Why even watch this movie then, you may ask? Because of Michael Fassbender who I could watch in absolutely anything. He is one of my favorite actors, and this was one of his early films, but it one of his weakest roles. This film came out the same year as Hunger and Fassbender got all the attention for his role in that movie, so I had overlooked this horror thriller. I was also surprised to find out that Jack O'Connell had a supporting role here considering what a breakthrough he has had in the last year. His performance here is so villainous that I want to go back and watch Unbroken just to see him suffer. There is something wrong about wanting these young kids to get what they deserve, but they are so hateful that audiences won't be able to help it. Kelly Reilly has also made a name for herself, starring more recently in the second season of True Detective alongside Vince Vaughn, and here she plays the lead character. She surprisingly stole every scene she was in despite playing a character who made some very poor decisions.As effective as Eden Lake is, I still can't really make up my mind if I cared so much for these characters of for the actors. I was engaged because I wanted Fassbender to teach the kids a lesson, but I can't say if the film would work without a well known and likable actor. This British film has inspired remakes of several similar themed movies which in turn probably inspired this one and opened the doors for their new versions, such as I Spit on Your Grave (1978,2010) and The Last House on the Left (1972,2010). Eden Lake may seem as pretty much a standard horror film that follows the basic genre formulas and clichés, but it does have a shocking finale. It is effective and accomplishes what it sets out to do, but since it is not my type of film I didn't get much enjoyment out of it and it did bother me that some of the decisions made by the characters seemed to be so ridiculous that they can only be explained as serving the plot. It is a very upsetting film and fans of the genre would probably be very pleased with it. http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Eden Lake

47,EVOL666,Good Chase Film...,7,22 March 2010,"I'd heard all the hype surrounding EDEN LAKE lately so I gave it a shot.  I'm always interested in any film where the majority of viewers find it 'brutal' or 'disturbing'-but I guess my thoughts on those types of labels are different than others. A young couple goes camping and is terrorized by a group of teen-aged trouble-makers. That's pretty much the whole plot until the semi-'twist' ending. Overall, I'd say EDEN LAKE is a good film. All of the cast shines in their respective roles, the settings and camera-work are solid, and the pace is quick enough to keep you interested. I guess my main problems with the film are the fact that it's really not nearly as 'disturbing' as I had been led to believe,there's nothing really original or interesting about the overall storyline, and the ending was foreseeable from a mile away. I guess 'disturbing' is relative to the eye of the beholder-but I didn't find this one to be any more disturbing than any other 'chase the prey through the woods' type horror/thriller. Same with the storyline. People get chased through the woods and evade capture until they're either caught or fight back. I will say that I liked the ending-but I saw it coming as soon as the first of the hooligans was offed.  Regardless of my issues with it-this one is solid for those that want to see a fairly typical chase-film. Nothing to cream about but worth a rent. 7/10",Eden Lake
48,Jonny_Numb,The Kids Aren't Alright,8,11 January 2009,"Well, that just confirms my plans to get a vasectomy.Despite a plot whose setup and machinations recall classic genre fare, there is a potent realism to ""Eden Lake"" that is so downbeat and unapologetic that I question the fairly high star rating I'm giving it. This is not the stuff of Oscar considerationin fact, I would say it's too contradictorily intelligent in its brutality to ever connect with anything greater than a cult audience. As with Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""Salo"" and Gaspar Noe's ""Irreversible,"" two widely divisive films that will stand the test of time, ""Eden Lake"" presents a moral gray area filled with seemingly ""normal"" characters faced with an evil that's chillingly nihilistic.""Eden Lake"" wears its influences on its sleeve, the most obvious being the classic ""Who Can Kill a Child,"" about a young couple on Spanish isle populated only by children who have murdered all the adults. The frightening thing about that film (in addition to the oppressive isolation) was the mysterious, unexplained soullessness of the children. In ""Eden,"" what makes the children so terrifying is their disaffected demeanor, as influenced by absentee parents and technology: they beat animals, each other, and grownups with little (if any) acknowledgment of real-world consequences, and implicate their accomplices with a camera phone. Imagine Larry Clark directing an adaptation of ""Lord of the Flies,"" and this is what it would look like.Writer-director James Watkins gives us a simple genre setup: a young couple (Kelly Reilly and Michael Fassbender) head off to a flooded quarry (set to be developed into a gated community) for the weekend; shortly after they arrive, their solitude is broken by a group of violent suburban youths. Watkins establishes the couple as very likable and sympathetic, and the gang as utterly loathsome (even ""innocent"" characters are coerced into horrific acts of violence), but Watkins isn't content to paint by numbers, choosing to throw moral curveballs at the viewer that makes the experience both infuriating (a compliment in this case) and thought-provoking. The biggest question (that, needless to say, goes unanswered) is, what makes children turn out this way? Anything but a passive horror flick that merely tosses gore in our faces, the greater intelligence of ""Eden Lake"" goes down like a bowl of thumbtacks: jagged, painful, and coarse. This is carefully crafted, brilliantly executed cinema that at once elevates the genre without skimping on violence that's truly revolting and unsettling. And even when some of the beats seem predictable (including a shocking conclusion), Watkins subverts our expectations into something even more horrific. ""Eden Lake"" is one of the best films of 2008.",Eden Lake
49,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Brutal, yet Socially Relevant Film",9,12 January 2020,"This was a film that I actually added to my Netflix list of DVDs back when I was in college. I kept moving things ahead of it, but it wasn't until I got into podcasts and heard people talking about this film that I really made sure to finally check it out. I've now given it a second viewing thanks to the Summer Challenge Series for the 2000s on The Podcast Under the Stairs. The synopsis is refusing to let anything spoil their romantic weekend break, a young couple confront a gang of loutish youths with terrifying brutal consequences.We start this actually seeing that Jenny (Kelly Reilly) is a teacher. She seems pretty good at her job and works with really young children. After school she meets with her boyfriend, Steve (Michael Fassbender) as they're heading to a quarry that is flooded to spend the weekend. It is a place that he's been before and he's excited to take her there. While they're driving, the radio talks about how children growing up are unruly and there even seemed to be things put into place with the government to correct it. What I like is that the school staff is blaming the parents while they're blaming the schools. No one really seems to be taking ownership.They arrive at a bed and breakfast that looks a bit rundown. We see there are a lot of trashy people there and they're just not nice overall. The couple tries to make the best of it and Steve keeps reassuring her that the quarry is beautiful. It will all be worth it once they finally get there.It is troubling when they come to a fence that is locked. The area is being developed into luxury homes. Steve drives along it and they go into the woods. It takes them time to get there and on their way they pass Adam (James Gandhi). He is collecting insects and ignores them as he's not supposed to talk to strangers. They do finally come to a beach. They try to start their idyllic weekend, but that is soon interrupted.A group of teens show up. We quickly see that Brett (Jack O'Connell) is their leader. With him are his girlfriend Paige (Finn Atkins) and his dog Bonnie. They're joined by Mark (Jumayn Hunter), Cooper (Thomas Turgoose), Harry (James Burrows) and Ricky (Tom Gill). They're playing loud music and the dog barks at the couple. It also defecates nearby on the beach. The first real troubling thing is that Brett bullies Adam. Steve doesn't want to get involved, but it bothers Jenny.Steve does confront them when they keep on being loud. It doesn't change anything, except making this group of hoodlums knows that they're getting under his skin. It seems that the couple is being spied on that night and it escalates when Steve goes to back up his vehicle and their tire is punctured with a bottle. He can't let this go and chases after them when they get into town. They soon realize they're outsiders and that this town keeps its own.The things continue to escalate when Steve realizes their bag is missing as well as their car. The couple confronts them once again, but this time something happens that sends Brett into a rage and he punishes them for what he thinks they did.I'm glad that I finally saw this film and actually mad that I didn't get it earlier. This film really is full of social commentary, nuance and then just gets quite brutal. I did know this last part coming in, but I'm not going to lie. There was a point where I was wondering if people actually overhyped this. It isn't as bad as I thought, especially after this second viewing, but that's not saying it isn't brutal.The first thing I wanted to go over was this aspect of these kids getting to be unruly. I like the idea being introduced over the radio. The couple doesn't even acknowledge it, which makes it even better. The dynamic is interesting though in that Jenny is a school teacher. I feel there's part of her that thinks they are just kids and that they're misunderstood. She doesn't even want Steve to mess with them aside when Adam is bullied. Steve on the other hand won't be intimidated by them and I like that Fassbender was cast into this role, as he is well built guy who is actually physically bigger than all of them. It brings up kids will be kids, but we see the fallacy in that thinking. It is a difficult line to cross though, as they are just children. It is fitting that my second rewatch would come after watching Who Could Kill a Child? That decision isn't an easy one and a line that you can't come back from. It becomes even worse though when we get glimpses of their parents and how they're brushing it off. The ending is quite bleak, which makes me feel bad, but I also really like it.Another aspect here is the mob mentality. Brett is a monster and I think a lot of that is nurture for him. We get a glimpse of his home life where his father is really tough and mean. Brett in turns takes it out on those around him, hence why he bothers the couple here. As I was saying though, he's also a monster. He has his friends partake in hurting Steve on camera as a way to manipulate them. He's a psychopath for sure as the rest don't really want to partake, for the most part. We do see that peer pressure though is a scary thing. My heart sunk at the end as well and seeing why these children act as they do.The last aspect I'm actually going to lump in with the pacing of this. I've established that Jenny is a nice woman who sees the good in these children. She doesn't like how they're acting, but as a teacher, she thinks she can help them. I like that what the teens do starts off as annoying and then becomes criminal before turning into straight up psychopathic. It moves in a way where you feel the dread growing and by the end, I'm completely invested and it becomes so bleak. As these builds though, we see the change in Jenny. She has to lose her humanity to try to survive and seeing the things she goes through I really enjoyed, as much as you can. I also like that she gets dirtier and dirtier until she looks almost like a monster. That is when she crosses the line that you can't come back from. The ending I thought was amazing for what this film establishes as well.That will take me to the acting. Reilly I thought was absolutely amazing. I love how they establish her to start and to see where she ends up in the end. I felt horrible for her, but her performance was great. Fassbender was solid as well. He's such a good actor and I actually like that he can take a secondary spot in this film. He is really kind of a catalyst for things to go down the dark path they do. O'Connell is someone I despised, but I love the performance. He really feels like a psychopath and manipulator. The rest of his group was good, especially since I love that they don't really want to do what they're being told, but with how strong of a leader Brett is, I believe the mob mentality would take over like we see. That also goes the same for the parents that we meet in different spots as well. They help round out this film for what was needed for sure.That will take me to the effects, which I'm not going to lie. I thought there would be a bit more of that from what I heard. That's not to say what we get isn't good. They look to have been done practical which I really liked. They looked quite real along with the blood as well. I was glad to see something later in the film was done at a distance as it had to do with fire and that is something hard to do with CGI. The cinematography is well done in that aspect and it helps to make things tense.Now with that said, this film really has a lot of social commentary and relevance for sure. It is a brutal film about being outsiders and getting mixed up in things with disastrous results. There's a lot of psychological trauma that is also going on here, not only with the couple but with the gang at the hands of Brett. I thought the pacing and build up of this was great as it coincides with loss of humanity of Jenny. The acting is great and the effects are solid. The soundtrack didn't really stand out to me, but it also doesn't take me out of the film. This film I wouldn't recommend to everyone, just because it is a bit on the extreme side. It is definitely not as intense though and I would actually consider this a gateway if you want to get into more brutal films for sure.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10",Eden Lake
50,Samiam3,Largely defective and not nearly as clever as it thinks,5,9 December 2010,"Eden Lake is desperate to be vicious, but doesn't bother to ask itself why (It's a horror film, so that's okay right? ...Wrong)The experience feels bloated and overlong and miscalculated. It thinks it is being clever or ironic by asking the audience to accept when the wrongs things happen to the right people and the right things happen to the wrong people. In fact, all this accomplishes is that it cheats the viewer out of taking a side.A couple are taking a vacation to the shores of Eden Lake, which is about to be turned into a large housing establishment. Some folks already live there, and not all of them are nice. The pair get into a bit of trouble when they accidentally kill a boy's dog. The boy and his pals go after them with a vengeance, on foot, on bike, with knives, with fire. In order to escape, the two have to turn the tables on their pursuers.One of the items that bothers me is that there is no motif for such sadism. It feels derivative and uninteresting, as if the film is missing the point of what makes horror films good. One might be tempted to assume that residents may not take kindly to outsiders vacationing on their terrain, interrupting their everyday leisure, but the movie has little or no concern for statement, and because it's never that scary, the brutality of the film further feels futile.The whole thing just doesn't amount to much, I've seen it before, and I've seen it done better.",Eden Lake

52,lemon_magic,"Technically well made and effective, but...",6,11 August 2021,"The movie has the apparent message, ""Never go anywhere, and if you do, NEVER confront teenage hoodlums if they bother you.""I found the screenplay and the performances and the cinematography mostly quite well done and effective. Very brutal, harrowing, and well staged.I have a major qualm with the downer ending: the whole point of a ""survival horror"" film is supposed to be that one lone survivor staggers out at the end of the movie, i.e."" ...And I alone am left to tell the tale."" (Moby Dick). You need an ending like that in this kind of movie - otherwise it's just a self-indulgenct exercise in sadism and torture.Even a scrubby, scabby, incoherent, torture-porn movie like ""Bunnyman"" knew that.As Roger Ebert once said (about another movie),""What's the point? To tell us that monsters and evil exist in the world? We already knew that.""Also: the movie makers were so eager to dash and subvert our expectations with the downer ending that they left a huge hole in the plot: There were simply too many witnesses to the wife's arrival at the family gathering to allow the father to kill her, and he would know this. And no woman (or mother) would let it happen. And all the wife would have to say is, ""Your son killed my husband and tried to burn me alive, and I've been running from his gang all night"", and the gathered parents and family, no matter HOW dysfunctional and enabling, would take her to the police to check it out further and have her punished or proven a liar.So I am annoyed with the writer/director for deliberately dragging down a pretty good ""hunting humans"" scenario just because he wanted to embrace the current trend of ""downer"" endings and proved he could one up Eli Roth. It wasn't necessary, and it didn't make psychological sense (at least it happened off camera.) So in my mind, after the final scene (with the gang leader smirking in the mirror), there is one more scene where he comes downstairs to smirk at the body...only to be told that the family has dragged the wife off to the police, to pay for her ""crimes""...which is where the truth will come out. (We don't have to see this part, it is just implied.)To summarize: an effective piece of filmmaking.BUT: I never want to watch it again, in contrast to the original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", which is 10 times grittier and more horrifying, and also holds up splendidly 4 decades later.",Eden Lake
53,Matt_Layden,A disturbingly dark film.,7,31 January 2011,"A couple go to Eden Lake for a relaxing weekend, where Steve plans to pop the question to his girlfriend Jenny. Much to their disdain, a group a thug wannabe kids plan to ruin their weekend and their lives. Very few films leave me in such a depressed and angered mood. The only film that really got under my skin and emotionally drained me was Martyrs. Eden Lake is a film that steps up to the challenge and offers the viewer a look into realistic horror. A scenario that could happen and one that does not end happily ever after. Eden Lake doesn't have the Hollywood ending that some people will be hoping for, which is why it stands out above the rest. The film presents us with some pretty disgusting and loathsome villains in the kids. They are arrogant, rude and crude. What at first seems like young kids being kids and annoying an older couple, quickly turns into something more sinister. They steal their car, after an altercation leads to the death of a dog, the kids go rabid and wild and chase after the couple. No more fun, these kids mean business. They capture and torture Steve, each taking their turns in stabbing him with a knife and choking him with the choke chain that belonged to the dog. I hated these kids and I wanted them to get what was coming to them, Eden Lake doesn't give you the pleasure of seeing any of that. The film quickly becomes a survival horror as the young lady tries her best to survive, not only the kids, but the elements. She is lost in the woods and has to fend for herself. I prayed and rooted for her to make it to safety and she almost did. Making it back to civilization, I thought she was home free. The ending is disturbing and leaves you with a foul taste in your mouth. Something that I applaud and hate the film for. Here we have a movie that decides to not play ball and it goes out on it's own note. Yet, I'm always one to hate a film where the character, that I absolutely hate, end of winning. Eden Lake is this kind of film.I watched it based on the recommendation of a friend, I liked it. It was shot well, the acting was realistic, even if the kids were annoying, and the gruesome scenes were indeed cringe worthy. Eden Lake joins Martyrs and The Mist for depressing endings that leave you angry and disturbed. Kudos.",Eden Lake
54,moviewizguy,"It Has Potential, That's For Sure",6,11 April 2009,"When a young couple goes to a remote wooded lake for a romantic getaway, their quiet weekend is shattered by an aggressive group of local kids. Rowdiness quickly turns to rage as the teens terrorize the couple in unimaginable ways, and a weekend outing becomes a bloody battle for survival.This movie has potential to be a great survival horror movie. In fact, it evoked a strong emotion for me. Unfortunately, that strong emotion is me having shouted at the screen 99.9% of the film's running time. This film is frustrating, not because it's brutal and violent, which it really is, but there are so many flaws in here that you wish that weren't there in the first place.First of all, you don't understand why the kids are doing what they are doing. It's as if they WANT to be caught by the police. The reason they kill will almost have you laughing in disbelief. For me, that's a major fault. You need a good reason to explain why people do what they do or just don't explain it at all. These kids are also dumb. I mean, really, these kids are DUMB, yet they always somehow manage to be on the same league as the surprisingly smart protagonists.Another big flaw is the amount of suspension of disbelief. In fact, the last twenty minutes of the film is filled with so many coincidences that it felt the film wasn't trying to be realistic anymore. Kelly Reilly and Michael Fassbender were good enough as the protagonists. The kids were annoying and dumb but I guess that was the point. I also liked the score and the outside imagery.The movie has potential and it succeeds in a disappointing way. It's not as good as you hoped it would be but it offers something much better than most horror movies these days. It's a brutal but frustrating movie to experience because of its many flaws. However, I appreciated this sometimes tense survival thriller that will leave people talking.",Eden Lake

It hits hard and bares close resemblence to real life attrocity that makes it feel a little too real for some viewers.The cast are all absolutely brilliant and the writing and direction draw you in and glue you to your seat!I first watched this movie a few days after hearing a news story about a group of kids that had burnt another child alive! These awful events, sadly, do really happen in this often sick world!What starts out as a minor dispute between a loving couple and gang of kids, quickly escalates into a struggle for survival that is hard to endure, yet utterly gripping from start to finish.Eden Lake, actually, shows us very little. It isn't gory, blood splattering horror like saw or hostel, yet it is far more disturbing! As the viewer you will believe that you have seen far more than you really have, and that is testiment to the sheer quality of the cast and the creators of this brilliant horror/thriller.Although it's not for everyone, I would say that Eden Lake is an absolute must see for fans of horror. Just be prepared to be shocked and sickened in a way that most movies daren't deliver.10/10 genius!",Eden Lake
56,saadgkhan,"this is an amazing, haunting thriller which you will always remember. Must Watch It.",7,24 December 2010,"EDEN LAKE – CATCH IT ( B+ ) Eden Lake was a pleasant surprise and I loved every aspect of the movie. The best thing about the movie is that it has avoided all the clichés of regular thrillers movies. The movie starts off with Kelly Reilly and Michael Fassbender, who are visiting the Eden Lake on a remote area. When they are resting over the lake side, they encounter some bullying teenagers, who become extra offensive and violent. The teenagers get offensive by playing loud music and showing his wiener to them. This makes them angry but they try to avoid getting into fight with them but when they rush to their car, they found out that their car's tire have been ripped with the knife. This makes Michael really angry and when he changes the tire, he crosses the bullying group in anger and mistakenly kills their dog with his car. This act makes the teenagers group really angry and they start hunting them down. After this the movie took quite an unexpected turn & we see some really gruesome torture when they make Michael their captive. The hardcore torture and hunt doesn't stop their and it goes till the end. The twist and fear literally creeps through out while watching Eden lake. I think its one of the best British thriller movies I have ever seen. Kelly Reilly & Michael Fassbender were totally new for me at that time and I think they did an exceptional job. Jake O'Connell did an impressive job as a main leading bully teenager. Overall this is an amazing, haunting thriller which you will always remember. Must Watch It.",Eden Lake

58,oneguyrambling,Without the 'it's kids!' hook it's just another lazy horror movie.,4,13 April 2011,"Eden Lake starts innocuously enough, a young couple get away from the din of the city for a weekend away at the titular lake.They are Steve and Jenny, what they do for a crust or where they come from doesn't seem important – indeed they are basically average middle class people doing middle class things – the only thing that seems important is that Steve is planning to spring a proposal of marriage on Jenny during the trip.The first night finds them arriving at a small town near the lake after a long and taxing drive where they stay at a bed and breakfast.They settle in for the evening and enjoy a quiet pint. Their night isn't so much interrupted or ruined but suffice to say other guests aren't relaxing in the same manner, and there is some unwelcome noise coming from other rooms and in the beer garden.Not to worry the next day sees the couple take the short drive into the backwoods to set up camp on the shore of a large flat and picturesque (for the UK I guess) lake. They do normal couple stuff, swim, picnic and sunbathe in the ""glorious"" UK mild summer – there's a reason Brits head to Australia for the Summer folks – and all seems good in the world.Then the film takes an unwelcome U turn into News of the Week territory. A group of ""unruly teens"", some perhaps even preteens settle in only a short way down the lakefront and commence being ""unruly"", swearing loudly, playing loud obnoxious music and overtly perving on bikini'd Jenny. Steve is 25 ish and fit so he heads down to sort all this out, which backfires when the whippersnappers openly dare him to ""do summin' abaht it mate"" and set to him verbally.I should also point out that they have a big vicious dog barking away the whole time.That night in the tent on the shore Jenny and Steve feel as if they're being watched – and they're not sure they like it.The next day things progress in a negative manner. Now this is one of those films where the dueling protagonists continually bump into each other repeatedly in convenient situations – or in this film extremely inconvenient situations. This is exacerbated by the fact Steve continually seems to make irrational and plain old dumb decisions when faced with rational alternatives.Anyway Steve holds a grudge which flares next day. After some comparatively smalltime events the kids nick the couple's car and joyride it about, leaving them on foot in the middle of nowhere with no option but to hoof it. In a remarkable turn of events they chance upon the kids who are gathered around a fire in the forest continuing to be ""unruly"".I can't go much further but Steve decides to confront the kids – fair enough – but when the kids pull knives and the ensuing struggle takes an unexpected (yet totally expected) turn the tone of the tenuous relationship changes from ""baiting and resentment"" to ""full blown hatred and violent intent"".The remainder of the film has the duo chased, hunted, tortured (both psychologically and ""other"") and generally bothered all over the forest as they attempt to get away. It is all quite reminiscent of the last half of the far superior The Descent, only with peachfuzz cheeked teens in lieu of albino sightless crawlers.This is why the film didn't work for me, I can read the paper to find out about the latest pointless act of sensory numbing violence that happened somewhere in the world, there is a sob story coming out every week to make you feel worse about the state of humanity. I don't need to see a bunch of kids who should be trading football cards and laughing when someone says ""Boobies"" stalking and terrorizing innocent people Romper Stomper style over the shop.In reality there is zero to be scared about in Eden Lake besides the very concept of ""teens hunting couple for practically no reason"". There are no ""boo"" scares, no amazing reveals that provide the unexpected, in fact the only moment to provide any tension in the film is exactly the same moment that has been in dozens of other films – one person hides while the baddies hunt and plot nearby, waiting for them to leave.Look if this is what you call horror then good luck to you, but an absence of genuine cinema scares and a lack of creativity makes this a depressing and uninspired exercise. I'd think the same even if it was monsters or alien creatures hunting someone if the plot was the same – but the fact that it is 12 year olds running around with pocket knives stabbing and lighting people on fire doesn't make Eden Lake scary – just sad.Final Rating – 4.5 / 10. A solid build up is wasted by a lazy second half that steals from numerous better films and gains notoriety solely by the so-called originality that differentiates the protagonists.If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com for over 500 reviews and plenty more good stuff...",Eden Lake
59,areatw,A contender for the worst film I've ever seen,1,27 April 2016,"I must have watched a different 'Eden Lake' to those who have rated it so highly. I would honestly consider this to be one of the worst films I've ever seen - complete and utter garbage from start to finish.The main characters, Jenny and Steve, are both clearly lacking in the brain department, behaving like a pair of kids themselves and demonstrating no common sense whatsoever during the entire film. Even at the start when they first arrive, any rational thinking person would avoid confrontation with a group of chavs rather than taking the attitude of 'we were here first'.Then we have the ludicrous plot (if you can call it that) which is so predictable that I could have quite accurately told you what would happen 20 minutes in. It just so happens that the first car to arrive during the couple's ordeal is the brother of one of the youths, and then the first house Jenny comes across when she escapes also just so happens to be the youth's family. What an unfortunate coincidence.Utter crap and a wasted 90 minutes.",Eden Lake

The plot was quite exciting. But I didn't like the fact that there was no happy ending.

61,mario_c,Shocking but realistic film,9,26 February 2009,"EDEN LAKE is a movie about an issue that is getting more and more significance nowadays and we all (society) should be concerned about it: teenage violence. In our modern societies teenagers especially over 13 14 years old are seen as they still were little kids. For many many things society has the same ""rules"" for a kid of 7 years old and a boy of 14 years old... and those ages are not the same! At all! About development (of body, personality, integrity, social relationship) I think a 14 years old can be better compared to a person aged 18 than to a 9 years old! (Of course it may change from person to person). What I mean is that especially from the mentioned 13, 14 years old a person knows very well what he/she is doing, and maybe even being a bit irreverent because of the age he/she should be responsible for his/hers own acts; and shouldn't be the parents blamed! Parents can control a child until 11/12 years old, after that they can't! A person who does terrible crimes at the age of 14 should go to jail like an adult! That's my opinion! I don't think it would be the solution to end the teenage violence, certainly it wouldn't, but I think it would be fair enough, because as I said before I think that a person of that age is not a child anymore. Nobody is still innocent at 14 years old!Well, let's talk about the movie now... I think it's great because it treats this issue from a brutal, disturbing and shocking, but also frontal and realistic way. At first sight it seems like a typical slasher of someone that is lost and attacked in the woods (like are so many from this ""sub-genre"") but then enters this polemic and currently thematic, the teenage violence. The film portrays very well this theme and takes us to a level of tension and ""reality"" that we are not used to see in a ""common"" horror movie. When we watch a film where we see a guy in the woods with a machete and a Hockey mask we think: ""well, let's watch one more horror flick and see some blood and guts"". And we say it with a smile on our face, expecting an hour and half of ""horror entertainment"", because we know ""it's just a movie""! But when we see a movie like this EDEN LAKE where there're no Hockey masks or machetes or psycho killers, but just a group of teenagers, we think: ""Hell, no, I could be there in the hands of those guys!"". In fact no one can watch this movie thinking it's just fiction (like everybody does with slasher flicks!) because it isn't! It's a very serious and realistic matter! And that's precisely what is shocking in this film: its veracity.The film is intense, suspenseful, gory (it has some bloody scenes, very well done) and crude. The acting is excellent from the main actors to the teenage boys and girl. The ending is excellent. It's an open ending like I use to appreciate. I just didn't like the soundtrack; I think it should have been better.In my final opinion, it's a shocking but realistic film. Probably one of the best I've seen in this genre in the last years. I score it 9/10.",Eden Lake
62,witster18,No Garden of Eden - that's for sure,6,10 April 2012,"You get as many of 'these' films nowadays as you got traditional horror film's in the 80's, and I think I like the old way of doing things. Today you don't have to follow the old set of survivor rules. I think director's today think it's fashionable to do this, but it's getting old really quick(especially for the brits and the Aussie's). Well, ""the Descent"" was done right.Maybe the 'unforgiving nature' of this story makes it more realistic, or maybe it doesn't, but either way it becomes a real let-down. Shame too - this film has loads of positive traits.I wanted to see every bully and their bully parents gets their toenails pulled off one at a time. The viewer gets no such satisfaction here.Let's go ahead and compare this to ""Harry Brown"", only Harry gave the audience some payoff. For that reason alone, ""Harry Brown"" is a better film.The only thing worse than the bully's depicted in this film, is their obtuse parents. Basically, the same kids, just grown-up. Not sure what the Brits think is entertaining about making that group the ""winners"" in such a film. It's that ""what point is the director trying to get across by doing this"" that is my single biggest gripe with the film. Shock value, yes. Payoff, no. Ticket's to the U.K.? No, Thank you.I thought the director went in the wrong direction with the final 30 minutes of this film. A shocking/not-original-anymore-fellas way to make a shocking ""B"" horror thriller that nobody will want to watch twice, and one that will make you want pull out your own teeth, but this film might have been one final act of revenge away from horror-gold-status.I'm distraught on the review here because I realize that any film that evokes strong emotions in me has to have some positive characteristics. Even with the ending let-down - I had to have been drawn into the movie to begin with to be so disappointed.Therefore, I'm giving this thriller a positive 6/10 score.It's quite thrilling and effective, and fairly well-acted across the board. There are the occasional ""what the hell"" horror moments, but not too many, and signing on an actor of Michael Fassbender's pedigree was a real plus. The ending of the film was perhaps the least predictable segment of ""Eden Lake"", but it is also the part of the film that held it back from greatness.This film is disturbing - in that regard it succeeded mightily.You'll like this if you liked: Harry Brown(slightly better), Green Street Hooligans(about even), The Decent(better), U-Turn(worse), Martyrs(about even or ever-so-slightly better) Blood Creek(not quite as good) and The Horsemen(better).63/100",Eden Lake
63,Sir_AmirSyarif,Relentlessly bleak and hopeless,8,5 August 2021,"'Eden Lake,' by James Watkins, is a fierce and thought-provoking thriller that is relentlessly bleak and hopeless, as well as grisly and gory. Watkins understands how to instill tension in the scenes and build it up until it elicits an overwhelming emotional response and, ultimately, a sense of despair. Outstanding performances by all involved, particularly Kelly Reilly and the terrifying Jack O'Connell. There are some issues with the story, but none of them detract from what is an effective, violent, and edgy thriller.",Eden Lake

65,JohnRayPeterson,The point of this movie is more brutal than any of its scenes,8,21 November 2012,"In case you haven't noticed the spoiler alert, I'm reminding you of it now. The point of this movie is more brutal than any of its scenes. Indeed, by the time the end credits start to scroll, the emotions you may have experienced watching some of the brutal scenes will have been cast aside and you will be left, spent, with an even stronger emotion, one which the movie conveys by its shocking and totally unexpected ending; the point the movie makes is that no matter how much hope you can muster, or should sometimes, it just won't make a bit of difference. Never has the expression 'totally screwed' been so applicable than for the main characters played by Kelly Reilly and Michael Fassbender (my two reasons for picking this movie in the first place). The couple is off to spend a romantic week-end in a nature environment, the time the man has picked to propose; the bunch of ruffians they encounter, in the last village either will ever see, go on a mean spree harassing the couple at first and then escalate to terror and beyond.Reilly and Fassbender deliver solid performances, but it is the writing and direction by James Watkins that packs the biggest punch; you experience a roller coaster ride of hope and frustration, and then get off that ride to experience further distress. There are numerous characters in the story; all, but the two victims, turn out to be no kinder to Reilly and Fassbender than the hooligans who persecuted them. Watkins initially shapes these characters as innocuous, and then transforms them before your eyes into nightmarish false hope. Exactly how the story and the director put you in vigilante mode before you walk out of the cinema is a testament to how effective the movie was.Critics loved this movie, for many good reasons, as I did. Many reviewers were blown away. However, I read some user comments that say there were implausible or unrealistic situations and outcomes, particularly when it came to actions of the bad guys; they used the same qualitative about the victims' determination and ineptitude. I trust Eden Lake writer/director did his research, good ones do, even for fiction. Crime annals, and other accounts such as war accounts depict no less far-fetched horrors. The choice adjective for the naysayers ought to have been 'unbelievable'. Global warming may well be unbelievable (to some) but it is not implausible or unrealistic. Life is funnier and more tragic than fiction; imagination is the result of cumulative knowledge and intellect. I found the movie to be realistic enough to strongly not recommend it for those who don't like horror stories(pardon the double negative); and, for those who appreciate the genre, particularly when it stimulates one's imagination, I do recommend it.",Eden Lake
66,MattyGibbs,Disturbing but excellent thriller about modern Britain,10,23 June 2013,This is one of the best British films for a long time. It's touted as a horror but for me is more a thriller/drama. It follows a young couple who decide to have a quiet weekend away in the British countryside but are terrorised by a gang of local children. What makes it more shocking is that things like this can and do happen. Although it pushes the boundaries of credibility at times there are many parts of this that ring true. The acting is excellent from both the leads and a strong supporting cast including the talented Thomas Turgoose and Shaun Dooley. It's a pretty bleak story and not for the fainthearted with some very shocking scenes and a fair amount of gore. As a thriller with a social point to make this is just about as good as it gets. It won't be for everyone of course due to the violence and this is probably why it is not rated higher on IMDb. For me the ending is brave and unpredictable and one of the best of any film in recent years which pushes the film from a 9 to a 10 in my book. Highly recommended.,Eden Lake

68,LoneWolfAndCub,"Brutal and bleak, not a film to enjoy, but definitely appreciate",8,22 January 2011,"Modern horror is becoming more and more predictable. If it isn't a remake, it's a movie based around torture, blood, gore and suffering. Now, I am not implying all modern horror is bad, as there are plenty of gems (both mainstream Hollywood and foreign), but I am saying originality is scarce and cliché is abundant. Eden Lake, directed by James Watkins (who wrote My Little Eye), turns a tired formula of 'vacationing couple attacked by strangers' and turns it into a brutal tale of survival with fantastic performances and a great script.The story is relatively simple, which in this case is a strength, as the film is not bogged down with unnecessary twists or development. Steve (Michael Fassbender) decides to take his girlfriend Jenny (Kelly Reilly) to a secluded lake which is about to be populated with homes in order to propose to her. This turns sour when a group of rowdy teens show up, led by the violent and unpredictable Brett (Jack O'Connell from Skins fame), and a confrontation gets ugly. From here on the couple are brutally attacked by the gang, and things get ugly quick.This simple setting allows for maximum tension, as the couple need to think on their feet to get away from the hoodlums. Some have claimed it is unrealistic and that the characters are stupid, but I think some people need to remember that in a situation like this, not everyone can stay calm and think rationally. Some people do stupid things not knowing they are stupid, and in a movie, especially a horror, it is these decisions that drive the movie forward. Also, I found that this movie was fairly good in avoiding making the characters overly stupid. For the most part this movie was quite real and unrelenting in its portrayal of violent youth and two normal people driven to violent actions.Eden Lake is beautifully shot and overall very well made, which makes it one of the best entries of recent horror. However, Eden Lake is also very disturbing and at times rather graphic, yet not so much that it is gratuitous. The film is depressing, with no happy ending for any characters, which suits the tone Watkins is obviously going for. At times the movie had me feeling a little upset, not because of the on screen violence, but the way the film is made. The group of teens are not all psychopathic, and seeing some of their reluctance and fall to peer pressure is all too familiar. Although Watkins isn't subtle about it, the current issue of gang violence is definitely important and Eden Lake does raise it. If you can stomach it, this is a very well made horror film which had me frightened, tense and utterly glued to the screen.A solid 4/5",Eden Lake
69,dfa120374,Decent But Pretty Brutal & Not Really For The Weak Hearted,6,18 January 2015,"Jenny & Steve are enjoying a romantic lake getaway. Or at least that was the idea. As they are enjoying some quiet time on the lakeside, a group of young louts decide to turn up and start to cause a bit of a ruckus. Steve asks them, politely, if they could keep the noise down but is shot down with contempt & attitude. Unfortunately for Steven & Jenny, this is only the start of a total nightmare and a cat-and-mouse game that puts their lives at risk.Eden Lake is, for the most part, a very good suspenseful ride with a few decent twists and turns. Now, I said ""for the most part"" because there are a couple of incidents that just don't really sit well in the believability part, the main one being the end of the film.The movie starts off well building pace & suspense - as well as hatred for the obnoxious delinquents - nicely as it goes along. One good thing about this movie is that, when you think about it, it's actually quite true to life because how many times have decent people's experiences been ruined by obnoxious, arrogant, and disrespectful people who don't care about anyone but themselves? It may not be to the extent of the movie but the underlying notion is the same.The cast do a pretty decent job too, especially Jack O'Connell as the gang leader who brings about a real believability of being an absolute b**tard. This is not really a film for the weak of heart either as some of the film is pretty brutal.Just as a side note, I've read reviews saying that the male lead, Steve, ""deserved to be killed"" which is totally ridiculous. He was acting on what he thought was best, and a lot of us I'm sure - myself included - disagreed with some of his actions, but to say that he ""deserved"" to be tortured the way he was and then killed is plain lunacy.Anyway, if you enjoy movies like Deliverance and Straw Dogs then you should enjoy Eden Lake as this is pretty much on a par with those.",Eden Lake

And as any good horror film is supposed to do, they go behind the fence and find out that they had best not done so.So far the set up for the film is rather standard. A location far from help, hidden from view by miles of trees, and unguarded in every way possible. The perfect place for bad things to happen. And so it does.The details about what is happening do not have to be revealed here as they are the bulk of the film - and pretty much standard as they are.

The problem is there is a major horror trope that happen wich took me out.I am not talking of the couple deciding to stay despite behind harrassed right away with multiple ocasions to do so. This is standard horror movie stuff, alright, ill accept this.I am talking of the concept of everybody is a derenged psychopath in this movie.First of all the kids. They do pick on another kid early on but lots of kids do that, they just harrass him, they don't beat him up or anything, yet later on they litteraly put him on fire? Despite some kids showing reluctancy to do bad things, there is more than half of them doing it without any issue, that alone is a bit fishy but alright.But later on, even the parents , and we are not talking 1 mom and 1 pop there, but the whole family, neighbors, friends, everybody just decide that because one of the kid told them something, its true and instead of reporting it to the police they gonna (i supose) kill, maybe even torture her.It even show the kid's leader kinda feeling bad at the end while he litteraly wanted to set the lady on fire early... This does not make much sense.But lets rewind back, so initially it started by some harassing and bullying by the kids toward the couple. Eventually after having their car, wallet and stuff stolen, they go confront the kids. Right away one of them tries to stab the man, so he wanted to kill him pretty much or hurt him really bad. Man defend himself and the kid's dog is killed.This make the kid's leader go in a rage wanting to kill the couple. Look i love dogs and i would be devastated if my dog was killed, but wanting to burn alive and torture peoples for it especially when its clearly an accident?Basically the movie ask you to turn off you brain too much for me to get into it. And if the concept of a family of crazy like Texas Chainsaw can work in a 1970s remote place, it just does not as much in modern time England.But the movie does have some very positive, like the tension, the gritty feeling of the chase, the acting. Its well shot and everything.Its just by the end i was like ""so thats it""? Felt very underwhelming. I am not against a ""bad ending"" but it need to be worth it, earned, and i felt this one didn't. Its really just ""everybody is crazy in this town"".",Eden Lake
73,danielmanson,2 is extremely generous,2,17 April 2019,"I have contained my rage for long enough....I tried to not write a review on this, but my word the ending of this has driven me to levels of anger I have never felt before.To cut it short, a group of UK ""chavs"" and their, shall we say, leader torture and kill the couple for no real reason. It's pathetic and annoying and to make it worse THEY GET AWAY WITH IT. You follow Steve and his wife for the entire film, only for them to die. What's the actual point????The ""leader"" is absolutely psychotic. He burns alive a young child, and tortures Steve, and manipulates his gang to stab him and torture him also. Then punches his mate to death. It's chilling and vile, yet GETS AWAY WITH IT!!!I cannot get over the ending, the wife (can't remember name in my fit of rage), manages to finally escape to happen to crash at the parents house. OH YEAH OKAY THEN.Plot holes throughout the entire thing as well. It's just annoying. ANNOYING.",Eden Lake
74,Shattered_Wake,"Unrelentingly brutal, but still beautiful. . .",8,5 November 2008,"Looking for a romantic weekend getaway, Steve (Michael Fassbender) and Jenny (Kelly Reilly) head to a secluded lake in the English countryside. After only a short while of peace & relaxation, however, their tranquility is interrupted by a gang of youths (which includes Thomas Turgoose of This Is England) looking to cause trouble. The kids' games escalate into violence & mayhem, and the couple's weekend of love and leisure is quickly turned into a fight for survival.While the story essentially seems like Ils or The Strangers set in the peaceful lake setting of Long Weekend with playfully terrifying youths reminiscent of those in Funny Games, I would not pass off Eden Lake as a simple 'clone' or 'ripoff,' but a film that takes the best of all those films and blends them into one quality horror-thriller. It nicely utilizes the suspense & mood of Ils, the beauty of Long Weekend, and the terrifying villains of Funny Games, but still adds in its own great elements including some brutal violence and a disturbing horror atmosphere. Writer/director James Watkins (My Little Eye) also delivers a strong script which he translates well onto the screen making for a simultaneously interesting & good-looking film. It's not all perfect, however. As stated above, the film utilizes many of the good elements from films to which it is similar. . . unfortunately, it also takes some of the bad. Most specifically, the stupidity of the characters in a film like The Strangers can be seen here as well (but nowhere near at the same level). For instance, it's hard to imagine that anyone would return to the same beach at which they were just terrorized and vandalized, but for continuation of the story, I suppose it works. Personally, I see many ways around it that the writer could've used, but he, unfortunately, did not. However, unlike many horrors of this type I've seen, the characters actually become more & more intelligent as the ordeal progresses rather than maintaining the same level of naïvety and blindness throughout. The characters actually learn & adapt to the situation like a 'real' person would if faced with the circumstances, and that's a rare trait to find in horror characters like this. Also, while quite a few of the typical horror clichés we've become so accustomed to are present here, Watkins manages to make the trite seem realistic rather than unoriginal. Most importantly, the film, unlike many of the modern horrors that have been flooding the market, contains some genuine scares and thrills that go beyond what many horror fans have come to expect lately. That reason alone makes the film worthwhile.To sum up, while Eden Lake is not a masterpiece and may be lost in the shuffle with similar films, it does NOT deserve that fate, for it is a very strong, suspenseful, and well made story that is more-than-worthy of a look for any film-goer. Fair warning, however: It is not an easy watch.Final Verdict: 8/10. Recommended.-AP3-",Eden Lake
75,nitzanhavoc,"Frustratingly cruel, not easy to watch.",7,2 April 2013,"It's been a long time since I've seen this film, during the time when I still didn't bother to rate and review every Horror film I watch. Lately I've been re-watching some of those I liked especially, but as for Eden Like - I'll pass. Not because it isn't good, but because nobody in their right mind would define it as ""fun to watch"", that much I do remember.However, what I remember most vividly is my utter sense of frustration, disgust and despair with humanity. Throughout the film I've kept feeling the urge to be there, so I could knock some hard painful sense into those no good hoodlums, and their sad excuse for parents! Very much like this decade's streak of ""torture porn"", Eden Lake plays on these emotions in the audience. Pity for the victim, rage against the assailants, and despair/helplessness.Acting and cinematography are good enough, nothing special worth mentioning as far as I can remember (bear in mind it's been a while), but the story and some of the scenes are what sticks with you afterwords. Personally, I can't call the sensations I get out of watching these kinds of films ""fun"", but they are definitely, in a way, rewarding. Eden Lake isn't easy to watch, and seeing as how this is obviously its goal - it's a success. My relatively low rate is only on account of my personal experience with it.",Eden Lake
76,Majikat76,Shocking brutality!,8,30 August 2017,"Eden Lake came as part of a run of films surrounding hostile teens. This film could be viewed as both a creepy Horror and a suspenseful Thriller, but is a unique structure for a British film and holds its own in the series of similar films around that time.It's not all screams and phantom perpetrators, it's one that feels realistic and much more gritty to a UK audience.",Eden Lake
77,Prof-Hieronymos-Grost,Devastating survival horror,8,26 January 2009,"A young schoolteacher jenny and her boyfriend Steve go on a romantic weekend up north to an idyllic setting called Eden lake, which is in actual fact a water filled in quarry. There romantic moments in their remote hideaway are spoiled by a group of aggressive young louts who seem keen on their task. Steve confronts them and has to stand down, losing face. The kids up the ante by stealing their car and when Steve finds them and confronts them again, a tragic accident sends tempers reeling, leaving Steve and Jenny in grave danger.Terrific survival horror, with an intelligent script and twists a plenty, that is quite engrossing. The performances from all are excellent, even the kids display a real affinity with their characters and show a range way beyond their years. Don't want to give to much away, so I'll just say it's a devastating film with a devastating ending, that's a mix between Deliverance and ¿Quién puede matar a un niño?.",Eden Lake
78,krachtm,This movie made me mad.,8,29 May 2011,"Since it's supposed to make you mad, I can only give it a good rating.The basic plot revolves around a couple stupid yuppies being terrorized by an even stupider group of hooligans.The whole lot of characters were so infuriatingly flawed, I found myself practically yelling at them many times. ""You moron!"" I would be tempted to yell. ""What's wrong with you? That's obviously the wrong course of action!"" Isn't that the point, though? There really aren't any rational, correct actions to take once things have spiraled this far out of control, and it's our duty, as intelligent and mature people, to make sure they don't.The teen playing the main antagonist, Brett, did an amazing job. I hated him with a passion, and I kept wanting to see him get what was coming to him, and, yet, it's strongly hinted that ignorance and violence were at the root of his problems. It's so very tempting to resort to violence as a solution to life's problems, and this movie tempts you strongly into adopting the same attitude as the antagonist. It's an insidious way of showing how such people are created, and while I greatly appreciated the craftiness of the writer and director, I still think they're a bit manipulative in their attempts to provoke a reaction in me (putting the protagonists in such a nasty situation).As a horror movie, this is excellent. I can almost guarantee that you'll have an emotional reaction. However, if you're looking for happy endings, intelligent and mature characters, or even a clearly morally-superior protagonist, you won't find it here, though I'm sure you'll find legions of people defending the protagonists as ""innocent"". Watch the movie again. You'll notice that Steve, the boyfriend, is a selfish coward, and Jenny, the girlfriend, eggs on his stupid macho attitude, by questioning his manhood, though she's the more sympathetic of the two, by far. Obviously, neither of these morons deserves what follows, but they're just as frustrating as the hooligans, who fearfully follow the orders of a sociopath, because they're scared of him, instead of standing up to him.I'd say this isn't a unique movie, but it's a good movie. Much like the spate of ""angry, white, middle class male"" movies of the 1990s (such as Falling Down), you'll see numerous people interpreting the movie so that it matches their own viewpoint, without any attempt to critically look at the protagonists. In that way, it works to both critique and exploit middle class fears. Sly, very sly.",Eden Lake
79,Cinema_Fan,"Read any good books lately? Somehow, I doubt it.",6,18 July 2009,"England's angry, illiterate, bored, cycling and jobless underclass go playing in the woods and play host to a pair of unwilling victims in what can be best described as extreme, inhuman behaviour. Set in a similar vain as John Boorman's classic claustrophobic Deliverance (1972), Susan Montford's While She Was Out (2008) and David Moreau's Them (2006), Eden Lake has joined the ranks of a new society, and in this particular case, a new England and a subculture of hate. Alan Clarke's skinhead drama Made in Britain (1982) and the notorious and banned borstal for young offenders' film Scum (1979) to Shane Meadows coming of age drama This is England (2006) are fine examples of the angst, frustrated underclass of England's green fields and city streets. Eden Lake is no exception. Shocking as it is brutal, disturbing as is it is unforgiving, this is James Watkins first time at full time direction and has shown that he has an eye for tension and drama. Setting the pace with a loving middle-class couple on a weekend break in the picturesque Eden Lake, who, by unfortunate chance, then veers into the nightmare holiday from hell. This too, can be seen with parallels to William Golding's 1954 novel Lord of the Flies, peer pressure sets the tone and with extreme bloody violence that fills the air with rancid language and bloody murder. The reason that Eden Lake works is that it falls upon the realism of the narrative and the very possibility that this worse case scenario could actually happen. I mean, who cannot look through their living room window and not see this debased youth culture walking and spiting on the streets of ""local town""? The beauty of Eden Lake is that it brings home the message that the ever-changing society we share has a never changing principle of frustrations and anxiety that can lead to scorn that can so very easily ignite into bitterness. It is the same struggles, and with poor education, poor housing, and poor futures that turn into outlets as drug use, alcohol use and for some, violence. Eden Lake has captured this explicitly to exploit a society that in the end knows only too well that from their conception exploitation is all they have ever felt. It is a shocking movie of the sign of the times that one can only prey that time will change for the better, but, deep down, I doubt it.",Eden Lake

Lewis' ""2000 Maniacs"" which came out in the 1960's, and to this day remains entertaining. It's funny and rewarding in the end. A more modern example of this kind of film would be Wes Craven's 1972 ""Last House on the Left,"" which was later copied in Deodato's ""House on the Edge of the Park,"" and the extremely entertaining ""Last House on the Beach."" Nowadays, we get movies like ""Wolf Creek,"" ""The Strangers"" and this piece of absolute drivel, ""Eden Lake,"" in which the viewers are treated to an unrealistic onslaught of violence and cruelty performed by the most unimaginable villains. I suppose that's creative on some level, but it fails to entertain. The viewer is left with no sense of anything, just wasted time.I'll sum it up for you: extremely unlucky and stupid British couple get harassed and killed by a group of children who were raised by irresponsible parents.For a WAY better film of this type, check out ""Who Can Kill a Child?"" Now that's a good one.Maybe you have to be British to 'get' this one, but I found it laughably bad and not in a good way.

81,gary-444,"Uncomfortable ""Shocker""",6,12 September 2008,"Director James Watkins has made an unsettling debut in this ""shocker"" which skips around a few genres, and borrows from illustrious antecedents, in this stock tale of bad things happening to good people.Young couple Michael Fassbender playing Steve, and Kelly Reilly playing Jenny ,unwisely choose a weekend away in a remote park and pay for their mistake.Some of this is stock formula; the pretty junior school teacher, the Sat Nav which urges them to ""turn around"",swimming in a cold English lake with their bags on the shoreline etc. However the film has aspirations for a bit more, with the antagonists being young feral children whose characters are allowed some development.The posse of miscreants is led by a malevolent Jack O'Connell playing Brett who reprises the empty viciousness of ""A Clockwork Orange"" into a modern setting, borrowing heavily from ""Lord Of The Flies"" in his sadistic manipulation of his peers.The ""strangers in a strange place"" theme is not as convincingly dealt with as ""Deliverance"" and ""Straw Dogs"" achieve, but nevertheless, although both films are borrowed from, Watkins does create am idiosyncratic modern quirky English paranoia which taps into one of the concerns of the day - juvenile delinquency .The very low budget is not at the expense of an intelligent script, and some convincing acting performances.But ironically, it's ""realism"" is to some extent its undoing.I left the cinema depressed and drained.The violence is not ""stylised"" it is real, there is not much room for suspension of disbelief. Although the plot twists groan a bit, no doubt around budgetary constraints, it's social realism touches Ken Loache's ""Kess"".This sets it apart from other stable mates, not least the recent American ""Timber Falls"" which starts from a similar premise.The feral youth ARE placed in the context of brutish, amoral parenthood. The bloodbath is initiated by the ""collateral"" killing of Brett's pet Rottweiller which elicits more emotion from him than the torture of his victims.The moral ambiguity of right and wrong are explored gently when Steve finds himself inadvertently ""breaking into"" a house, and more savagely when Jenny kills a young teenager in her flight for help.Pointedly, the behaviour of the adults in the community is a sick cauldron for the behaviour which is unleashed.I cannot say i enjoyed this film. Yet there is something undeniably powerful about it.Watkins deals with the personalities particularly well and I wonder if he has more to offer us than straight horror fare, I suspect the answer is yes.",Eden Lake

The main characters were being hounded by young teens ffs. None of them were likely even 16 years of age, let alone big or tough enough to scare anyone remotely sensible or tough. All the characters were lame and dumb and couldnt harm a fly to save their lives in needed. Learn to think critically folks, and also learn how to fight. That is to say, learn when you can actually win, or when you should walk away.

Very well made and some real suspense is present but this isn't much fun to go through as an audience. If stark and real is what you like than this movie works very well.

86,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,A sad but gruesome horror flick it even has a message,7,19 March 2020,"Yesterday I watched this film and it was kinda sad horror film in which it wears a message. It means mind your own busines and leave the youth kids alone. This Young Couple Steve (Michael Fassbender) and Jenny (Kelly Reilly) drives to Lake Eden for a romantic weekend and they are harassed by gang of youth kids. Everything was fine until Steve compliant to those kids about their load music. Everything was fine until Steve killed Brett (Jack O'Connell) leader of the gang's dog Bonnie and that becomes a personal brutal vengeance to the gang.I like the film it has a message everything would have been fine if Steve would have left the kids alone. He goes and kills Brett dog. Honestly I sympathize with Brett more than Steve. Cause I am dog lover and the film shows that Brett loved his dog. Everything would be fine, if Steve would mind his own buisnes, the couple wouldn't have any trouble in the first place. If someone would murdered my dog that I love so much, I would do the same as Brett taking my own justice.That is why I am saying this film has a message leave the youth alone and you want have any trouble. I like Michael Fassbender in X-Men movies, but as a hero in a horror film he was terrible. The finale is not explained what happened to Jenny on the end was she beaten or raped? Except the finale this film is awsome. I like Finn Atkins as Paige would love to see her toplessness ha ha. But good acting performance from everyone. From the British horror films I still prefer Hellbound: Hellraiser II (1988) and Dog Soldiers (2002), but that's just me.Kelly Reilly was great as anti-heroine, I like her.As the film Lake Eden I like, just I am not fan they go and kill the dog.

Not many times these three things go together, but here they combine superbly. It is hard not to compare it with 'Deliverance' for just a bit and only just a bit it resembles. I have to appreciate it's screenplay and script, though generic it doesn't take that easy route of protagonists doing stupid stuff to get into more trouble. It creates genuine trouble. A couple gets away for a weekend to 'Eden Lake' which is soon to be converted to luxury homes. They encounter a gang of rude teenagers who steal their car later. When the couple goes to confront them, things turn ugly and the worst side of everyone comes out. Every single cast member have given it their best to portray horror of each scene. This movie also does stand as a warning to kids in terms whom to be friends with and whom to avoid. The climax is the icing on the cake any horror movie would be proud of. I have not experienced the level of tension and horror in any other movie I have watched in recent times. For non-supernatural horror movie fans, this is one movie you should not miss.",Eden Lake
88,Jacques98,This is kid's stuff.,2,14 January 2009,"If there is anything from the film industry that I'm sick ofmore so than PG-13 horrorit's safe, predictable R-rated horror. You know by walking into a PG-13 fair what you're going to get. But when a movie is hyped up to be ultra-brutal, thought provoking, and bears and R-rating . . . well, I except all that. When it doesn't deliver, there are few things that make me angrier. I realize I'm the unpopular opinion here when I say this, but: Eden Lake was kid's stuff. Not only did it lack any overt gore/brutality whatsoever, it lacked anything whatsoever intelligent to say. It pretty much took the script for Straw Dogs (1971) and wholesale copied it without fully understanding it. Eden Lake turns pessimistic into pathetic. It follows the same predictable formula that you've seen so many times it's nearly impossible not to see EVERY plot point at least ten minutes before it happens.First off, let me say that I absolutely love movies that try to kick the viewer in the balls. I love it when a movie is so brutal that it physically exhausts me to view. I love mean-spirited films. Be it 60s movies like The Last House on the Left, or be it modern movies like SawI love it all, and everything in between. But why Eden Lake fails to fit into the same bracket is because it really is nothing truly brutal or mean-spirited whatsoever. The level of gore is so low I would have given it a PG-13. The level of mean spirit is so low I felt like I was watching a date-comedy gone wrong. There is next to zero intensity. For the entire first hourwhich is over half the filmI was bored out of my mind because the only thing happening was the two leads kissing and acting like a plastic, politically correct couple. And this is supposed to be the unrelenting intensity that grabs me by the throat and never lets go? That's a joke. My point is, the main problem with Eden Lake is it is absolutely inoffensive. It's an easy, politically correct movie. There is no punk edge the movies it copies had. There is nothing even remotely as brutal as the rape scene in Straw Dogs or the ending of the first Saw. Nothing. Just kissing and some shots of the leads running through the woods and screaming.The other main problem is every single character is a stereotype. And no, I'm not just referring to the people in the ending. I'm referring to every single character that had screen time. The two leads act overly dramatic, cliché, starry-eyed lovers with so little realism it became laughable. And here's an over-the-top concept that's about as likely for Hollywood (or the UK equivalent) to do as pile up their money and burn it: Why not have kids actually act like kids? The kids are all annoying stereotypes. They would have had more realism if they were trying to act like dead tree stumps. The lack of realism in the kid's acting actually did make me laugh. The reason Straw Dogs was so successfully with the brutality was because it was possibly one of the most realistic expressions of human emotion on film. It's a concept modern cinema doesn't understand. Doesn't try to understand.Overall, Eden Lake is one cliché after another, with stereotypical characters, yet it tries to make you think with a cliché moral that comes off cheesy, not intelligent. Brutality is next-to-none. Intensity is zero, because you know exactly what is going to happen. Point blank: There is nothing here worthy of your time. I was looking forward to this movie so much because I stupidly had faith that someone could further the brutal genre I love with originality and a moral that actually made me think. Yeah, right . . .2/10",Eden Lake
89,mcjensen-05924,Couldn't Have Been Worse,2,19 March 2021,"This movie is rare, and not in a good way. It's one of those where every decision a character makes is dumber than the last. Victims and bad guys are all equally unlikeable idiots. Every bit of dealogue is cringingly absurd. Story is simple. Couple goes to lake and gets harassed by local teens. Things escalate into extreme violence. Simple. Been done a million times before, and way much better than this pile of dung. First let's take the couple. Why would they return the next day to the same spot where they were harassed by a bunch of teens, and even got a tire slashed? They had a miserable day and seem eager to repeat the experience. Disconnect. He wanders right into a home because there's bicycles out front, as if those bikes just had to belong to the kids who bothered them earlier. Right? Noboyd does that! At one point they're driving trying to get away at night, and their headlights have been broken out by the kids. He's saying I Can't See over and over, yet is still driving at a very high speed. Well that's just brilliant. Of course they crash. Things like this just stretch credibility beyond the breaking point. The kids are a sordid lot of losers led by an arrogant jerk who has them do insane/cruel things which they just blindly go ahead and do. What a friendship! Everybody needs a friend who yells at them and belittles them and beats them and makes them commit multiple felonies. Inexplicable and impossible plot turns abound, and not just the small details. This movie insults your intelligence about 3 times a minute. And you'll get to see the worst fake limp in cinematic history. Things that are nuts: a car comes out of nowhere to cause a crash in the middle of the night on a remote road. Happens all the time. The leader of the kids get enraged over a dead dog, completely neglecting the fact it's their own fault for starting this ridiculous chair of events. I could go on and on. Hiding in a small shack then esaping through an escape hatch in the floor, which the kids don't see when they get there a few seconds later. Breaking the glass to get a map on a trail sign, which is thick actual glass rather than the plexiglass that is always used on such signs. Hiding in a dumpster that has a bunch of feces in it. Never mind why a dumpster would be filled that, she goes in and could easily just squat there and only get it on her legs, but when she emerges she's covered head to toe in the stuff. C'mon, man. When she pulls a stick from her foot and needs to find something to bite down on, there's a perfect size stick right next to her. Convenient. When she needs to cover up her dying dopey boyfriend with brush, wala! There's loose branches everywhere. Perfect. Onc second she's standing behind a shed and the next second she's on TOP of the shed. Nice to have a 8 foot vertical jump and land quietly enough where the kids inside don't hear you. Oh, and never mind they break into the shed looking for her when it's clearly been chained from the outside. But with enough slack in the chain so the door open like 3 feet. And an ending that will make you cringe with rage. As if all these dead bodies will never be found. It's strange how great actors get cast in a movie like this and all of a sudden they can't act! Wooden dialogue delivery and clearly just going through the motions to get that check. Two stars. One for the production value and one for the pretty lake. I'm being generous. And all this could have been avoiden if the idiot boyfriend just took them somewhere else the next day. He was the most useless dud one could have dreamt up for such a role. A few of the kids gave good performances, but not the main one. Stinkbomb all around. Michael F. should erase his name from the credits on this one. How embarassing it must be.",Eden Lake

91,anxietyresister,A useless film with nothing to offer but excess,2,15 June 2009,"The best compliment you can pay Eden Lake is about the alleged 'cleverness' of its title, because Eden is the exact opposite of the hell that is modern UK society as depicted in this film. This is a wet dream for Daily Mail readers, as their worst nightmares about Broken Britain are fulfilled and then some more: we have chavvy parents, indiscriminate loutish kids and more thuggish violence then you'd see on the streets on London if England lost the World Cup next year on penalties. All of which are targeted at a nice young couple who wanted a weekend away in a remote cottage. They've packed their swimsuits and sun cream, and are looking forward to time away from the rat race. Alas, they reckoned without the local hoodlums, whose abuse quickly escalates from intimidation to stealing and, after the lovebirds kill the lead hooligan's pet dog in self defence, to attempted murder. Their only option is to retreat into the nearby woods and hide, but what do you know, they don't possess a mobile phone and their pursuers are relentless, not to mention psychotic. Even the nice Indian boy they befriend betrays the couple, under the guise that he can join this moronic gang. Is there any hope for them or this country of ours?Well, no. Not according to the utterly bleak view of this movie, which slowly lowers us into a pit of despair before enveloping us in it. There it something hypocritical in the way it condemns the sadism present but simultaneously wallows in it. All the nastiness is far more likely to be a turn-on for an audience brought up on the same values espoused by the lower classes in this film, rather than acting as a indictment of Great Britain in the 21th century. So OTT is the violence and blood letting that it feels closer to a parody, and the younger cast members playing the thugs don't have the talent to carry out their task with any conviction anyway. Or to put it more specifically, they are penny dreadful. It is also very hard to sympathise with the victims too, as they provoke the youths despite being drastically outnumbered and don't contact the police when given the chance early on. During the game of cat and mouse that ensues later, they make decisions that beggar belief and constantly land them in further trouble. For what is supposed to be a film about a serious subject, this is a bit of an insult to the intelligence.The end result is a truly terrible film, which works neither as drama nor as a thriller. The message it sends out isn't exactly very pleasant either. If the plot sounds interesting, go and see Kidultness or its sequel Adulthood. Neither are perfect, but both are made with infinitely more care than this exploitative nonsense, and they more to say on modern yoof then EL can dream of. Erm.. that's it. AVOID AVOID AVOID.

92,Tcarts76,Eden Lake is eden for horror fans.,8,30 September 2012,"This story is one of those great movies of the horror genre that plays with normal, real world scenarios that can easily devolve into a real nightmare. I love these type of movies because they evoke very real, believable situations that could actually happen. For me this movie, and movies like it are the scariest ones that horror has to offer.Eden Lake is about a couple that drive out of the city to have a romantic vacation, just the 2 of them, at a lake. The situations starts when a group of teenagers interrupts them, ends up stealing some items, and the couple confronts them. What follows is a hellish nightmare.The acting was well done in this one, and the story was great. The movie does definitely evoke wrenching feelings in the viewer that the squeamish might have to look away and cover their ears.This type of movie is one that kind of always makes me feel guilty and wrong for liking. The gruesome sadistic nature makes you kind of want a shower after its over, and like looking at a train wreck, you hate it but won't look away. I reconcile those feelings by saying that precisely because of those types of feeling goes to why I have to give it high marks. Any movie of this genre that makes you be able to not say, ""It's just a movie,"" when you are done watching it is a movie done right.Like my reviews, hate em?

94,Mr_Censored,Lean and mean and so much between!,9,24 April 2009,"When going for a romantic camping trip in the woods, an expletive sign warning so-called ""Yuppie Scum"" to stay out would be enough to make any rational person settle elsewhere. Maybe they didn't see it, maybe they didn't care, but when Jenny and Steve (Kelly Reilly and Michael Fassbender) decide to partake in a little rest and relaxation on a secluded beach, they find themselves being harassed and tormented by a group of kids barely ripe for puberty. What results is a lot of bloodshed, an abundance of shocking imagery and a surprisingly strong love-story.While the movie owes a lot to the likes of ""Last House On The Left"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" – more so in form than in function – it still has enough steam going for it to make it feel fresh and intense. The characters – whether you love or hate them – are in turns, realistic and ugly. You'll sympathize with the yuppie couple in love (anchored by strong performances from Reilly and Fassbender) and your gut will wrench at the brutality of the children stalking them. Director James Watkins sets up enough time to build the characters up, to the point where you truly care for them, and will have you on the edge of your seat for the entire second half of the film as they struggle for survival. Despite being Watkins' first film, he gives the film a gritty, realistic feeling that doesn't feel cheap or amateurish, only serving the shocking violence all the better. The writing is tight, all the way to its jaw-dropping conclusion, leaving room for an abundance of subtle social commentary.Slickly paced, intelligent and most importantly – real – it's about as good as horror gets. ""Eden Lake"" is the rare kind of horror film these days that will grip you tightly and leave you emotionally exhausted. Also, it's the first camping movie in a long time that may have you thinking twice about pitching a tent in the middle of nowhere ever again. If nothing else, it's bound to get a reaction from anyone and carries a few surprises up its sleeve. Even the most jaded of horror fans will be surprised by how much it affects them. Worth a trip, and certainly worth the sweaty palms that will ensue.",Eden Lake
95,seawalker,Brilliant horror movie,8,15 September 2008,"""Eden Lake"" is the second film I have seen at the cinema in as many weeks, about an attractive young couple, in a remote location, tormented and pursued by malevolent forces. The first film was ""The Strangers"".""The Strangers"" and ""Eden Lake"" are movies that follow a formula. Nothing wrong with that. The success of ""Eden Lake"" or ""The Strangers"", or any other generic couple-in-peril movie you might care to mention, stands or falls on the execution of it's central idea. I do admit that I liked ""The Strangers"" a great deal, but I think that I preferred ""Eden Lake"".""Eden Lake"" is a brilliant horror movie. Really horrible, extremely nasty, gory and violent, with a memorable ending that will play itself over and over in your head long after you have left the cinema. More than just a straight horror movie, ""Eden Lake"" touches on themes ripped straight out of nice, right wing, tabloid headlines: Urban collapse. Youth, ignored, damaged by the indifference of parents, teachers and society. How will they can threaten the middle classes? How will they threaten YOU!""Eden Lake"" boasts quality naturalistic performances. As the 'Scream Queen', Kelly Reilly is fantastic, throwing herself into the role and into all kinds of filth. But, for the most memorable villain in recent years, watch Jack O'Connell as a character called Brett. Brett is a cold eyed, arrogant, borderline psychopath. Brett is one of the scariest people I have seen in a cinema in a very long time.My Brother lives in inner city Birmingham. He normally laughs long and loud when he watches horror movies. He did not laugh once during ""Eden Lake"". In fact, he was particularly thoughtful when we were leaving the cinema. Later, with regard to ""Eden Lake"", my Brother said to me, 'That film wasn't funny. I know a**holes like that. I live in a place like that'.When all is said and done, ""Eden Lake"" is only a horror film, but it is a great horror film. I cannot recommend ""Eden Lake"" enough.",Eden Lake

All you need is a group of 12-14 year olds, a couple of them that have been raised by bullies and bad news parents, and you have a synopsis to a pretty good thriller on your hands. A couple decide to spend a weekend at a quiet lake where the gentleman intends to propose unbeknownst to them they pick an area of the beach inhabited bu a gang of English toughs who of course get in their way...actually many times! You scream through this as the boyfriend of the victimized couple of coarse has to venge back at them, heck being a man i would've done the same. Only during a scuffle after the gang steal their vehicle the band leader Brett's dog accidentally dies and then all hell breaks loose! OK speaking of Brett he was played by young English actor Jack O'Connell who did an amazing job of making you hate his guts as the psychotic bully. Anytime i see the Extreme label draped across the title of a film i always make sure i have a look as they usually are a no holds barred horror film.

""Just kids"" who have no boundaries and make no difference to adult criminals. Unfortunately there are plenty of similar cases in the real world.

99,keelhaul-80856,"A Decent Horror Flick with good ideas, but really stupid characters.",6,25 June 2019,"This one has a nice take on ""Lord of the Flies"" or barbaric kids attacking people in the woods. It could even be seen as a social commentary on the way kids are being raised to be selfish idiots who run their parents' lives today, and are untouchable by teachers and authority figures in some settings. It has some tense moments, some scares, some gore, and some interesting ideas.However, the downside is that the protagonists are so mind-numbingly stupid, and the plot is pretty implausible.When the guy realizes he is being targeted by crappy teens, why would he keep approaching them unarmed(oh, that's right. It is England, but at least get a knife). I would never approach a group of teens that already stole my car, exposed their genitals, and cussed me out-- at night in the woods, with my hot girlfriend and no weapons or help.Why does everyone drive a car so fast to ensure they wreck it? Once you are clear of the kids, drive at a slow pace until you find a road. There is no way you should be running into trees or other objects at 60 mph. This happens several times and is a bad horror movie cliche.Why does the gf hide and watch the torture of her lover???? For God's sake, either attack the kids or (more sensible)-- run as hard as you can to a place with a phone signal or a business where you can get help.Is every child in this area a psychopath??? Even the bullied kid helps them commit torture, theft, and murder???? What did these kids think would happen once they stole a car, tried to run over people, tortured them to death, light people on fire, get their buddy killed, etc????? I find it hard to believe that all 7 kids are going to go along with this without running away or squealing to someone.What does the blonde step on while running away near the power lines??? Do they just plant spear heads in the middle of the grass to impale people??The bf climbs into random homes and breaks in????? WTF?Of course, EVERY SINGLE person they run into is a relative of these evil kids, and will do anything to protect them.The ending is very anticlimactic. I like the fact that they give it a dark ending, but it doesn't really feel like a good stopping point. There should have been a little more excitement or reasoning.Overall, this is better than many other crappy horror flicks you will watch, but it could have had a much better script and reasoning, with characters that are truly put into a bad situation that they can't plausibly help. My first inclination is not to break in peoples' houses or stick around a lake, once my tire has been flattened and everyone is rude or dangerous....please write these premises better in the future.",Eden Lake
100,FKDZ,What was the point?,2,5 August 2021,"I find it hard to see the point this movie is trying to make, if any at all. The only thing its saying, and is completely thrown in your face is that parents make the kids... and I guess this shows the irrational extremity of that theorie.This is a awfully boring and bad movie. And finale was the kicker to this whole mess. It's neither satisfying nor scary. Its just straight up misery and a whole bunch of bad acting and terrible dialog. The only scary part about this movie is the egregious use of loud noises and jump scares.The directing is very odd at times, annoying inconsistent shaky camera, and a very weird scene where it almost felt like there was an actual cameraman in the shot (like handheld handy-cam style).The music is nothing special, was fine though.This is marked as a horror and thriller, I'd leave thriller out and the horror is more-so just torture. That's it really. That sums up the entire movie. Some annoying plot so kids can commit insane crimes with inhumane reactions.The script.. there's just nothing there, the characters aren't smart, there's no depth. The acting is okay, but really bland.Waste of time 2/10.",Eden Lake
101,daggersineyes,um... well the rottweiler was cute but the movie sucked,1,11 August 2013,"Chalk me up as another who wishes you could give zero or even minus points to a movie. I found this movie in a ""best of British horror"" top 10 and if this is an example of Britains best horror I don't think I'll be wasting my time with any others. *****spoilers **** There was nothing about this flick that redeemed it. The behaviour and motivations of all concerned made no sense and were purely there to drive the plot. Everything the couple did was stupid & unrealistic, everything the kids did was stereotypically evil & unrealistic. The acting was OK I'll give it that but not enough to save this film from being a total disaster. It wasn't scary or shocking, had no tension or atmosphere and didn't have me rooting for anyone. I didn't care what happened because everything about the characters actions completely lacked credibility. The ending was NOT clever, despite some commenters delusional belief that it was ""original"" and ""surprising"". It was obvious, cliché (it's been done a million times and much more convincingly) and pointless. You could see that's where the whole thing was headed from the start and in case you still weren't sure, the ""triumphant"" music as she drove away made sure you knew she wouldn't make it. I despised the movie Wolf Creek for it's flat direction, cardboard characters, pointless violence and lame ending but at least that movie had some (albeit minimal) redeeming qualities. This is a limp British version of WC with kids instead of an old bloke with an even more ridiculous unlikely ending. Like Wolf Creek, this movie serves no purpose other than to satisfy cravings of sadistic people who care nothing about movies but just like watch innocent people get terrorised, tortured and killed with no consequences to the perpetrators. ****end spoilersThe theme of this flick can be done well and has been done so much better in other movies that I've actually enjoyed. Not for the violence but for the acting, direction, character development, mood, story, pacing, camera-work, tension-building, thrills, mystery and all the other ingredients that need to be in a movie to make it worth watching, no matter what the subject matter is.I'm sure this dog of a flick is a hit amongst the less intelligent serial killers of the world. But for everyone else, please do not waste your time watching this drivel. Instead, watch the French film ""Ils"" (Them) to see how this genre is done properly.",Eden Lake

103,kevin_crighton,A brutal movie.... sadly a predictable ending. (hints given regarding the ending),5,12 September 2008,"A young couple head off for a romantic weekend away at a remote lake. Once there they have a series of run-ins with a group of local teenagers, which leads to a violent and horrifying confrontation....Eden Lake is another movie about people heading out to a remote area, only to have horrible things happen to them. To that end, it falls into the same category as movies such as Wolf Creek, the Hostel movies, Wrong Turn, The Hills Have Eyes, etc... However, this is a UK movie having ago at the same genre. But sadly, it doesn't quite work.There are good things here though. Kelly Reilly and Michael Fassbender are good as the the couple are pretty good. The supporting cast are also impressive, especially Jack O'Connell as Brett, the leader of the gang.James Watkins wrote and directed Eden Lake. As a director he stages some good sequences, including a rather brutal torture scene that would give anything in the Hostel movies a run for their money. However, he is let down by his writing. The plot isn't that original, but it's due to a couple of scenes near the beginning, before the violence occurs, that makes the ending sadly predictable. Once Jenny starts to fight back, you know how this movie is going to end. Or at least I did.The violence as I said is brutal and at times horrific. Watkins doesn't skimp on the blood when required, not only in the mentioned torture scene but other places including a squirm inducing moment with a metal nail and a foot....But sadly as good as these moments are, and as good as the cast are it's let down by the ending. The idea that the kids are out of control is something being debated in public opinion and the newspapers in the UK, and it makes some points about this, but in the context of the movie, the inclusion of scenes suggesting the parents are as bad as the kids, sets up the ending which in a way lessens the impact of the movie. Had the parents not been seeing until the end, or had come across as normal, then the ending might have worked better.

Growing up and becoming square is the ultimate evil.This movie and its ilk are clearly made by men who have grown up and haven't quite come to grips with how old they are yet. They feel young inside but are afraid of the actual young because they don't recognize them or their interests - they have nothing in common anymore. It's all the same from generation to generation but this generation just so happens to be the first truly weened on pop culture - specifically movies and TV telling them how important and special their childhoods were (see the 80's nostalgia parade that just won't end).There's a lot of good tension here but it's all in service of pure torture (also an 00's theme). Eden Lake is hurtful and mean and unrelenting in its nihilism. This is both good and bad. If it had more to say it might be good, but it's really a genre exercise about a final woman outsmarting these terrible kids (their inexplicable brutality just suddenly happens with little build-up or explanation - it lacks the surreal unknown of ""Them (Ils)"").

105,richardwworkman,An examination on the idea of the victim,8,18 September 2021,"Initially this film felt like it was trying to transfer the American hillbilly back water community to the British countryside and it didn't quite pull that off.The rednecks are replaced by a bunch of unruly estate kids and while this isn't entirely inaccurate, it feels cliches and hackneyed.There aren't many parts of the British countryside as isolated as those in the US so the prospect of being completely cut off in England are few and far between.Putting these inaccuracies aside, what we have here is a good pursuit horror with plenty of tension as things go increasingly wrong on a camping trip from hell.There's an element of the lost boys led by a deranged Peter Pan character mixed with Lord of the flies societal underclass of growing moral vacancy.As the brutality of the gang increases in ferocity, the fabric of membership holding them together begins to unravel and the film becomes a race to the death.However, the more i think about this Film the More i begin to realise that many reviewers have painted the educated, middle class couple as the victims of an amoral ill-educated social underclass.There's a sense of entitlement in Jenny and Steve's actions. Their moral outrage and superiority is acutely miss-placed as they are trespassing in search of a romantic and increasingly vanishing English ideal.Ultimately there is more to this film than just the gruesome carnage following the death of a dog (see John Wick) insomuch as the contrast in social strata forms a distinctly uncomfortable piece of commentary on contemporary British identity and subsequent sense of ownership.",Eden Lake
106,BJJManchester,Well-Mounted but predictable and eventually unpleasant Horror-Thriller,5,2 March 2012,"EDEN LAKE is a basic retread of earlier horror-thriller movies,it's basic plot and incident not markedly different from such previous and superior titles such as STRAW DOGS (1971),DELIVERANCE (1972) and THE HILLS HAVE EYES (1977),although this time with an over-plus of ugly,sadistic violence.A pleasant middle-class couple (Michael Fassbender,Kelly Reilly) intend to have a short break in a seemingly quiet rural backwater,though it is increasingly disrupted and ruined by a group of unruly teenagers,led by Brett (Jack O'Connell).The disputes become more fractious and nasty,eventually leading to outright violence and bloody confrontation,with little hope for any redemption for either side.We are in over-familiar territory here,with decent people merely trying to enjoy a quiet break being tormented and brutalised by rustic,backward rural types.Director James Watkins marshals the events in technically adept and slick fashion,though it becomes more and more dubious the longer it goes on,with improbable plot complications,underwritten characterisations,but worst of all an indulgence in some exceptionally gruesome and unpleasant violence,which eventually goes so over-the-top as to distill much of the thrills and tension,with being sickened taking precedent,especially in the very nasty torture scenes.The main actors involved are adequate,but their characters are mostly ciphers if not stereotypes,taking second place to the sadism on show.Some reviewers thought Watkins was playing on the fears of the British middle-class of a so-called feral chav underclass,fodder for numerous UK tabloid newspapers for many years,in their interpretation of 'Broken Britain'.This indeed maybe a fair point,as those from middle-class occupations as portrayed here as the hapless,tortured and innocent victims,where the working-class are just evil,sub-human,violence-loving Neanderthals,with no redeeming features whatsoever.There have been increasingly negative representations of the working classes in UK film,TV and media for some time now,and this film does not help such crude stereotyping.Reilly and Fassbender are actually not that likable in any case and rather stupid in aspects of their behaviour which is not very believable,and O'Connell,as Brett, the leader of the teenage gang,is the only really psychotic and brutal member who encourages his mates to join in with the bloody attacks on the couple.The only remotely sympathetic character on show is Cooper,played well by Thomas Turgoose,who is very reluctant to join in with the violence until he gives in to the intimidation from the sadistic Brett.Turgoose doesn't appear much in the film at all but still manages to bring some nuances of character if not humanity despite it not being evident in the role as scripted,and when he gets his in savage fashion from a terrified Ms Reilly,it is the only time in the film we feel a tinge of compassion for anyone in the midst of all the mayhem.EDEN LAKE could have been a more gripping and exciting horror-thriller,but in the end it just falls into the trap of showing violence for the sake of and eventually too much of it,leaving the viewer repelled rather than thrilled,not bringing anything original or inventive to it's oft-told story,and relying on characterisations and stereotypes that are becoming all too regular if not offensive in this present day and age;EDEN LAKE succeeds in being disturbing,but also troubling towards certain social groups,which maybe an even greater cause for concern.RATING:5 out of 10.",Eden Lake

Kelly Reilly and Michael Fassbender both play powerful roles as a couple who want to get away for the weekend to eden lake. when they get there they start getting victimised by a gang of youths that reside there. things then get out of hand and the youths are out for blood and start a hunt for the couple which leads to possibly one of the most powerful and shocking endings i've ever seen. it really will shock anyone who will watch it.i've never heard of Kelly Reilly before but she does a really good job as the lead in this film. Michael Fassbender is going up in my ratings too, other films with him in are Inglorious Basterds, The descent, 300 and Hex. Hex isn't too great mind you. also in this film is a brief appearance by Thomas Turgoose (This Is England, Somars Town) as one of the youths. the gang leader Jack O'Connoll as Brett is exceptionally great, he is also in Skins which i hate...... terrible show. brilliant directorial debut by James Watkins (writer of My Little Eye) i hope to hear from him more in the future.i'm a little annoyed by the rating of this film..... 7.0 !!!!!! it should be a lot higher than that. i think the ending itself should give it a place near the top 250. overall this film is one of the best horror films ever made.

Not only is the film filled with teenage scum villains which (sadly) are portrayed pretty accurately with parents to match that are all worthy contestants of the Jeremy Kyle show, but it has the nerve to offer no justice, no catharsis for the dehumanisation you witness. Its a staggering misstep that leaves viewers dumbfounded, and left with a repellent taste in the mouth reminiscent of the worst horror films. Eden Lake could have been good, if the writer-director wasn't so keen on showing banal, evil scum own the screen and receive no comeuppance for their trademark deeds. Everything feels set for a revenge-fuelled final act, before the plot curtails out of control and leaves you trapped in frustration, almost glorifying in the success of the turgid lower-class members of England who don't belong but sadly exist. Is this social commentary on constantly unjust law? If you can't take pleasure on seeing retribution for the inhabiting garbage of the world, then what's the point. Either way, 'Eden Lake' is best avoided, since the only people who'll take enjoyment is the 'people' the film represents and leaves victorious. 4/10",Eden Lake
110,geoffox-766-418467,A Totally Horrendous Film,1,13 February 2014,I'll attempt not to repeat most of the reviews in order to give my personal opinion. First of all I was surprised I watched this to the end. I kept thinking the evil doers would get their just reward. But no such thing. This writer and director (no names needed or said) to this viewer were such sick sensationalist idiots. I believe they enjoyed the bloody effects and gory details more than they did in creating a good film.What disturbs me the most is the viewers that found this film a good movie. It scares me that there is a market for this kind of trash. That there are violent people who enjoy violence and sadistic viewing. I think it as a sick minded movie that disgraces the artistic endeavors of good film makers.On the plus side there is great photography. Some of the cast seem adequate in their portrayals. Direction was awful and the writer should be arrested for displaying this kind of violence. This is why the world is sick and such violence that exists today. It is a shame that this is an example of Sundance Channel Productions. I respect Indies and know how they are difficult to finance and produce. Whoever put money out for this dirt must have their heads examined. I'd be interested to hear what Robert Redford would think of this kind of film.I will not give any credit to this piece of crap by mentioning names of those involved. I'm sure many of them will be grateful.My favorite part of this movie was the scenery before any actors appeared.Farewell Eden Lake. Here's hoping to never see you again.,Eden Lake

112,cadillac20,A Great Indy Horror That Will Leave An Imprint,8,24 September 2009,"Horror is a tricky affair. Sometimes, it's good, goofy fun. Other times, it's deadly serious and affecting. And in either case, it can turn out to be very, very bad. Luckily, 2008's Eden Lake is not. This is a film that will leave you with a feeling deep in your gut nearly every moment of the film, from the time it begins to after the credits. What's best said about the film is that it's horror lies in something realistic and frightening, a tale tale story about parenting and the effect of poor parenting on children.This film, for me at least, was deeply disturbing. Although it does have its fair share of clichés, some I even found myself laughing at, when it ramps up and the real horror begins, it become deadly serious. I found myself continually horrified by the what was being done to these people. Even more so was the fact that this lovely couple was being brutalized by a group of teenagers. It sends a deep message about the capabilities of humanity, no matter how innocent they may seem to be. It's a sticky subject, but a good choice on the filmmakers part. This is much more than just another ""don't go into the woods"" tale. Of note are the performances, most of which were good, but the lead baddie, the leader of the teenage bunch, was particularly good. Acted with such rage and angst, he became a frightening character, despite his young age. The direction should also be noted. We are presented with a truly hopeless situation. Even so, till the very end, there is a glimmer of hope. Eden Lake was a pleasant surprise. The trailer does a good job of selling the film, but it's power lies in the viewing of the entire film. You can't help but feel somewhat sick, but also quite intrigued and moved. If you enjoy horror that that leaves you with that gut feeling, then you will enjoy Eden Lake.",Eden Lake
113,bhester0806,Okay movie terrible ending,6,4 August 2021,It seems like every horror thriller starts great and they never can write a decent ending and this movies no different. Still worth a watch but nothing great.,Eden Lake
114,Craig_McPherson,"Totally engrossing, yet completely dissatisfying",5,23 June 2009,"In 2006 the French directorial and writing duo of David Moreau and Xavier Palud delivered Ils (""Them"" in English). It told the story of a young French couple working in Romania who find themselves terrorized by a group of kids. Leaving aside a few minor details, Eden Lake follows essentially the same plot, with the setting transplanted to the British Midlands and the couple on a camping trip, as opposed to being attacked in their own home.Whereas the similarities between the two movies are striking, with both delivering a bleak, nihilistic story that flips the bird to those in quest of satisfaction, Eden Lake, unlike Ils, proves ultimately dissatisfying on a profound scale. This isn't to say the movie isn't engrossing. In fact, it sucks the viewer in and holds you in its mesmerizing grip throughout. It's just that whereas Ils held back on the identity of the mysterious group of attackers providing the viewer with a measure of revelation at the end that dampened and skewed the outcome, Eden Lake doesn't cache any secrets, and even foreshadows several surprises.The tale revolves around Jenny and Steve, a young couple out for a weekend of camping at a secluded lakeside spot Steve's known about for years. When they get there, however, they find their tranquility disturbed by a group of chavs from the local town. Things quickly escalate to the point where the couple are hunted like animals by the teens.There's much to like about Eden Lake. The acting throughout is top notch, as are the production values, editing and pacing. In fact, if it weren't for the similarities with the earlier French film, I'd probably rank this higher on the scale. Both movies tell a grim tale, yet the way the story unfolded in Ils made the ending easier to swallow. With Eden Lake you'll find yourself wanting to drive a spike through the heads of numerous little bastards, but don't hold your breath for that to happen.",Eden Lake
115,Michael-Hallows-Eve,One of the best British horror movies you will see!,10,25 August 2012,"This movie is one of the best horror movies to come out of Britain. It had me going through almost every emotion possible. The acting wasn't brilliant but what it lacked there it more than made it up in the story. From the first frame until the end you can't help but get drawn in to the characters. I was totally in to them, wanting them to get through their turmoil and be victorious. I felt anger towards the children who were tormenting them, I felt sadness towards a couple of the kids who were involved in the bullying, and I felt empathy for the main tormentor at the end, which when you see the movie you'll understand exactly what I mean. And as for the ending, you DO NOT see it coming, and you are left feeling furious because of how it plays out. As I said, one of the best movie's you will ever see. I give it a 10 out of 10.

Decent main characters in a pretty harrowing, pretty investing situation
Violence is shocking and effective, effects and sound design go a long way
Fitting soundtrack
Really heavy gut punch of an endingCons:
Villains, while not unrealistic, are pretty one note, not the most unique characters
Most of the story is predictable
A good handful of weird character choicesBest part: the ending for sure, the implied violence in the bathroom is shockingly horrific and really left me with a frustrated feeling
Worst part: the boyfriend walking into the house early on by himself, really silly decision and only really aided in making the ending that much more spoon fed and predictable",Eden Lake
117,howie73,Duff Chav horror,1,25 May 2009,"This is possibly one of the worst films ever made in Britain. Not only is it morally repugnant and predictable in its misguided tendencies to glorify evil, but it's also badly written.There are too many plot holes to mention, but amongst many farcical scenes is when the protagonist somehow managed to jump on top of a disused cabin to hide from the Chav louts (Is she the bionic woman?). Such scenes border on farce and comedy.The couple had every chance to leave the lake, and anyone in their right mind would have left but this is surely because this film has no hold on reality or truthfulness.The couple are badly drawn and their descent into murderous behaviour is, yawn, a wet liberalist take on subversive middle-classes being just as bad as the vile working class. The film has issues with its location. although Eden Lake is supposed to be in the midlands, each chav has a different accent, and the parents' accents are Northern, more Yorkshire than Midlands. These annoyances are part of the wider failure of the film to retain consistency and validity. The chav ringleader has a Bristolian accent while his parents have a Northern one. Totally ridiculous! A better ending would have seen the woman charged with murder and the other chavs getting away Scot free - this is how things happen in sweet England, not the shoddy horror nonsense that engulfs this genre.All in all, this film will infuriate anyone who cannot suspend disbelief when watching this tripe. Truly awful. The kind of film that many deluded film critics would praise for being worthy and socially relevant, but that is at the expense of a badly conceived story. Avoid like the plague.",Eden Lake
118,brandon_lee420,Probably the most disturbing film I have ever watched!!,7,11 July 2010,"During my twelve year life, I have watched films like Battle Royale, Audition, and Tokyo Gore Police but none of them come close to as disturbing as Eden Lake, a film which is surprisingly British. Battle Royale and Audition were very disturbing and that is what made them masterpieces but with Eden Lake it is a whole different story. While the whole romantic getaway turned bloody is very stereotypical, your thoughts change as the film progresses and turns more violent while maintaining that horror feeling. I have heard of disturbing films that could easily wipe Eden Lake off the list like Salo or 120 Days of Sodom, Pink Flamingos and the likes, but I haven't viewed them yet and so Eden Lake is, officially,the most disturbing and shocking film I have watched......so far. I wasn't expecting this kind of disturbingness from this film and my vision about this film was ""cheap horror thriller with a retarded story"" and I have to say that I was most certainly wrong. The film doesn't automatically get into the action and you have to wait a good twenty minutes before the film gets injected with adrenaline but the introduction of characters is brilliant. During the introduction of the characters you begin to become attached to them and you have to flinch your eyes when one of them is being tortured. I also like the fact that this film has the adult-killing-kids thing back to front and you get pleasure when you see the kids doing the murdering. James Watkins made his directorial debut as a director by making this film and he should be proud for creating something like this which visualizes a threat of kids being more violent in UK. James Watkins is also the writer for notable films like The Descent. The acting by Michael Fassbender was memorable and very convincing. He did an excellent job of portraying a man who has to fight off a bunch of f*cked-up kids. The insane kids also did very good of making themselves in the film come to screen. The group leader Brett, played by Jack O'Connell, was very terrifying and had a sense of authority on him. Jack O'Connell did an over average effort in playing him. The performance which I most loved was by Kelly Reilly because she does an outstanding job of someone who has to release the beast within her in order to survive and escape from the insane kids. Her performance was as realistic as it could be and she, in result, made the film far more enjoyable.Stephen Taylor invites his girlfriend, a kindergarten teacher (Jenny), to spend the weekend in Eden Lake, a paradisaical and remote place in the woods. However, his true intention is to propose Jenny. While camping at the lake shore, they are disturbed by a gang of loathsome boys leaded by the punk Brett. The next day, the couple realizes that they have been robbed and are stranded in the woods without their car. While walking through the forest trying to reach the road, Steve and Jenny meet the gang and they are brutally attacked. Steve is captured by the youths while Jenny is seeks a way out of the woods with the criminals chasing her.Tension in the film builds up slowly from the part where they are on the beach enjoying the sun to the part where they have to run for their lives and hope to get back into town from the dreaded woods. The torture scenes are, what I found to be, quite fun to watch because they are shown in a realistic way and the actions are committed by a bunch of teens. The leader forces everyone to participate by force and it is pretty devastating to see thirteen year old kids doing atrocious acts. I read a review by someone who wrote ""leaves u with desire to corner some teenager and beat him with something heavy,"" and I have to agree in a sick sense that, yes, it does make me want to do that to a random teenager after watching this film. The gore in this film is pretty tame but I was glad not to see tons of bloods and guts because it would have ruined the film in an artistic way. I highly recommend this film to anyone who wants to crap themselves and who likes tension at its best. Eden Lake is a film not be missed out on and I suggest that you watch it as soon as you can because............you have to!! 9/10 - Eden Lake is a very promising film that won't disappoint viewers!""Over and Out."" 11 July, 2010.",Eden Lake
119,MattBirk,A Raw and Realistic Scenario with a Memorable Ending,8,2 August 2015,"Eden Lake is a very effective tale of survival, with just the right amount of gore thrown in to make it something special. Though there are some very brutal moments, the movie mostly makes a strong statement about our societies increasingly out of control youths and child rearing. Eden Lake comes off as very raw and realistic, the way it was filmed makes it more brisk and intense (if that makes any sense). While the movie is very well put together, the acting, cinematography, and story are all damn fine, the high point of the film is that it really gets you thinking. What would you really do in that type of situation (before the point of no return of course)? Here, age is the key factor, none of the 'thugs' are over the age of 16, so how far SHOULD you go or how far WOULD you go, given their young age? They're clearly too young to actually fight/hit, but the way they keep pushing the main characters, is it justifiable? And, of course, once the kids take things way too far, then you obviously have to defend yourself and fight back. But like I said, the movie really got me thinking about the situation, which is fantastic for a movie to do such a thing. And that ending, there is a lot to say about it, but I won't give anything away here, but I certainly enjoyed it. Eden Lake is a very solid entry in the horror genre coming from the United Kingdom.",Eden Lake
120,Hawkensian,Eden Lake is 90 minutes of cruelty with genre tropes that obscure any intelligent commentary.,5,24 January 2016,"With an 83% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and claims that it is 'thought provoking', one would expect Eden Lake to be cut above Hostel, Saw and other torture films that appear comparable. While it may be superior to a certain degree, it remains a decidedly shallow film that is too constrained by the tropes of its horror genre framework to be taken seriously.The film follows Jenny (Kelly Reilly) and Steve (Michael Fassbender), a young couple who retreat to the Midlands countryside for a romantic break. As the couple drive north of London, there is an ominous radio discussion about the state of education and the perceived animosity brewing between the young and the old, assembling its themes of 'Broken Britain' in a manner that is perhaps slightly obvious.After several disconcerting encounters with some obnoxious locals, the pair set up camp on the sandy banks of a flooded quarry. Their tranquility is soon interrupted by a chavvy young horde of Daily Mail proportions, led by the psychopathically aggressive Brett (Jack O'Connell). The conflict begins with general boorish behaviour and a wayward Rottweiler, and feeling the weight of his masculine responsibilities, Steve approaches the group and politely asks them to behave themselves. His reasonability is spurned and the couple are soon fighting for their lives in what is effectively their attackers' back yard.Many barbarous things have happened when the aggressive and the controlling have attracted the meek and the impressionable. The first example that springs to mind is the 1993 abduction and murder of toddler James Bulger by two ten-year- olds, Robert Thompson and Jon Venables. The pair's twisted crescendo of rebellion began with truancy and shoplifting, which led to the idea of abducting a child and pushing it into the path of an oncoming car, which finally led to James's abduction from the Bootle Strand shopping centre and his brutally protracted murder on train tracks by Anfield Park. The two boys enabled and normalised each other's behaviour, and the roles of ringleader and minion became quite clear in police interviews.Once arrested and interrogated by officers, Jon Venables was wrought with intense fear and remorse. He confessed to the killing, but was unable to tell the part of the story that he ominously called 'the worst bit'. Conversely, Robert Thompson, described as 'street wise way above the age of ten', was hostile, dishonest and unrepentant. Thompson and Venables had a typical dynamic that became horribly toxic over a day's truancy; it could inspire darkly compelling material for either print or cinema, providing it was created with intelligence and sensitivity.Eden Lake could have been this film. It could have been a bleak social commentary in the vein of A Short Film About Killing and Boy A; a mature and intelligent insight into senseless violence and the nihilistic, ignorant, vulnerable people who commonly commit it. Instead, the viewer gets a tropey horror film that focuses on neither the group nor the couple in a meaningful way. The film's main concern is brutality, such as showing us what it looks like when a Stanley knife is forcibly entered into someone's mouth.Despite Eden Lake's themes of class and age divide being highly superficial, political commentators have made the film fit their agendas. Owen Jones, one of The Guardian's most prominent PC enthusiasts, wrote the following in his book Chavs: 'Here was a film arguing that the middle classes could no longer live alongside the quasi-bestial lower orders.' Like many who are preoccupied with ideology and prone to knee jerk reactions, Jones mistakenly believes that the portrayal of one group of teenagers is supposed to be representative of an entire social group comprising millions of people.With good performances and uncompromising brutality, Eden Lake grips and shakes its audience quite effectively. However, it is mere viscera rather than political commentary, sharing more in common with The Last House on the Left than A Clockwork Orange.50%",Eden Lake

But how wrong I was. This is one of the most thrilling cinema rides I've seen in years. Truly stunning in its brutal attack on your senses. Whats rare is, you really care about the two hapless characters who find themselves at the mercy of some little Ferral Under Class Kids (im sure you can work that one out) and the acting is top notch. Michael Fassbender plays his character with a depth of realness throughout, right up to his highly emotional end. This is no popcorn and happy ending movie if thats what you're after. I sat at the end just staring at the screen when it was over. Your senses will be rattled by the intensity of what you've just experienced. A brilliant movie then, and one I'll be recommending to my friends now as something which must be seen. You will feel like you want to rush in and help the characters as their situation worsens and feel disgust at how horrible certain parts of Britain have become.

123,saint_brett,Relentless Soccer Thugs,5,12 November 2021,"I've put off watching this movie for too long. It comes with big wraps apparently. I hear it's outstanding? The only modern British movie I've watched recently was a movie called ""F."" It was about a bunch of hooded teens terrorising a school teacher after dark. Oh, and that other British skit I watched about the killer on the train, who hates cats, and Something about an exploding cow when lit up by a match at the end. The name eludes me, but it was quite funny. Let's see if Eden Lake is all that it's cracked up to be.So who is that? Bridget Fonda, and The Wolverine, leave the city for some rural soccer-mad English town and on their first night encounter feral kids, King Kong Bundy, child abuse, and raucous drunken lads basically being British, according to the volumes of alcohol they've consumed.Arriving at Eden Lake, Fonda and The Wolverine, encounter a handful of rude chavs who show no respect and even expose themself. Must be our baddies? (You get a group of kids like this together and they do tend to be rude.)They survive the first night all okie dokie, all things considering. But as if you'd hang around this place after what you've already encounted so far.On the second day, The Wolverine, is about to propose to Fonda when they realise that their car is missing and the meanest gang, straight out of Cornwall, speed off and lure the two adventurers into the woods where a fight ensues leaving a Dobeman deceased in the tussle.Chase is on.Thirsty for blood, the soccer hooligans capture The Wolverine, leaving Fonda to fend for herself. (Other than the dog caper, they must be angry that Everton lost the final?) They seem to just run around in circles for most part of the movie and get nowhere. It's frustrating.""Follow tha blude.""
This is the problem with a lot of British movies, and why I don't watch them, you have to enable the subtitles as some of the hardcore Cockney British accents are hard to follow. (Try watching that movie ""Dead Man's Shoes"" without subtitles. I didn't understand one word of that movie.)Without paying attention, Fonda drives a vampire stake right through her foot, hampering her efforts to escape. No doubt she'll just get up and keep running. Any regular folk would be incapacitated, clutching, and wouldn't be able to walk for a month, letalone run.Fonda's double crossed by some boyscout, who wants to prove himself to the gang of soccer hooligans, and for his efforts he has a tire placed around his neck, doused in fuel, and set alight. Some initiative. They didn't go to these extremes in that ""Green Street Hooligans"" soccer movie with the ""Lord of the Rings"" kid from ""The Faculty."" Okay, so maybe I've seen a few British movies.This is England, eh?While all this is going on, The Wolverine, is also baked in the fire but Fonda escapes again.The soccer hooligans don't exactly sing to the tune of ""Ringa Ringa Rosy,"" they mean business, and pursue Fonda relentlessly. But learning from the textbook of Predator, she turns into Dutch, and drives an improvised dagger into a random boy's neck out of sheer madness. (First blood.) Strike hard, strike first, lady. Well done, lady. Now the hunted becomes the hunter apparently?Small world! Out of all the houses to seek refuge she enters the soccer gangs parents house and is outnumbered and put into another ordeal.WHAT - that's it? The baddies win in the end?What of Fonda?I wouldn't classify this as a horror movie and I just wish someone had of turned the tables on that Brett character. If anyone deserved to die, it was him.

The non-existent ending left me with a bad taste for a long time. Everything is in your face: bad people at the B&B, bad children on the beach, bad mother serving at the restaurant, bad parents having a party. Got it!

Otherwise, very well done movie, very suspenseful, with good performances, good pacing.However, people with weak nerves, maybe avoid. Even if not as extreme as Funny Games, Eden Lake definitely takes some inspiration from Haneke's classic, so perticularly people who are easily upset by cruelty and injustice, consider maybe skiping this one.

127,FrightMeter,Lingers with you for days....,10,6 January 2009,"I knew ""Eden Lake"" would be a divisive film the minute the ending credits started to role. It doesn't take the easy, clichéd, and expected way out, and instead, opts for a more unconventional ending that has succeeded in really pissing some people off. I don't think I have heard some many gripes over the ending of a horror film since ""High Tension."" Despite how you feel about the ending of the film, it is undoubtedly a brutally realistic, chilling roller coaster ride getting there.The film's plot sounds as clichéd as they come in the horror genre. A loving couple, Jenny and Steve, decide to take a weekend trip to Eden Lake for some rest and relaxation. When the arrive in town, they witness a group of unruly teens who seem to have free reign of the place. Shrugging it off, they decide to go to the lake and relax by the waterfront. It doesn't take long before the group of teens show up with their loud radio and foul mouths to stir up a little trouble. Word are exchanged, the kids leave, and the couple think again shrug it off. However, later they discover that the teens have stolen their vehicle. They track them down, demand it back, and from this point forward, things spiral out of control and the film escalates in a grueling cat and mouse game, with the teens stalking, torturing, and attempting to kill the couple.Some scenes of ""Eden Lake"" are just sickening to watch. Not because the director piles on loads of gore---the film is actually kinda tame in that department--but because the actions are being committed by a bunch of teenagers. A few in particular seem to be emotionless and have no sense of life or death. It is scary because we here so often about violent act being committed by young people and people claiming that adolescents are being desensitized to violence. How true that is is certainly debatable, but ""Eden Lake"" gives us a disturbing look at what this concept might look like and certainly it isn't all that far-reaching in its depiction.Everything about this film, with the exception of one key scene, seems utterly realistic. Characters are flawed, and during the most intense torture scene of the film that actually had me looking away in disgust (which trust me...rarely happens!), the filmmaker showed the different reactions of the kids committing the acts. Not all of them wanted to do it...some even knew it was wrong...but they do it anyway because of peer pressure from the leader of the group, Brett (Jack O'Donnell in a powerhouse performance). A girl even stands a casually films the events with a cell phone camera. It is clearly a game for some, yet for a couple of them, they know what they are doing is completely and utterly wrong, but are compelled to play along. As the movie progresses and the violence increases, the viewer is as helpless as Jenny and Steve because their situation seems completely impossible to overcome given the circumstances. Both Kelly Rielly and Michael Fassenbender give completely believable and sympathetic performances as the couple in peril and these are two characters who we quickly form a bond with because they are genuinely nice people who are in complete love with each other.The film is wonderfully shot with some great cinematography. The pacing is quick, and the dialogue crisp and realistic. However, one scene I found unbelievable was when driving shortly after their first confrontation with the kids, Steve notices their bikes outside of a house. He decides to stop, apparently with the intention of confronting the kids and/or their parents. He goes into the house, only to realize that the father probably isn't much better and has to escape. I just didn't think that a character would actually stop at a house to confront a bunch of kids who cussed at him, particularly on vacation. Most would have let it go and moved on.The ending, as mentioned is either love it or hate it. I was indifferent at first, but the more I thought about it, the more I think the ending increases the effectiveness of the film. Not to give anything away, but I think it speaks volumes to the state of parental control, involvement, and lack of discipline and parenting that is prevalent in our society. It's a tough pill to swallow for some--that their attempts to be their child's friend rather than parent--could have dire consequences, but it isn't completely far from the truth.""Eden Lake"" is tough to watch and makes you think. What causes kids to become so desensitized to violence? Are parents ultimately responsible for their child's actions, particularly if they take the ""my child can do no wrong!"" attitude. The fact that the viewer is left to imagine just what does happen to Jenny is also pretty disturbing, particularly when the last frame of the film is the main ring-leader's smiling face.FrightMeter Grade: A",Eden Lake
128,cmovies-99674,This movie is the perfect slasher horror its tasteful and is terrifying in every scene.,9,10 August 2017,"PROS: EDEN LAKE is a film that is engaging in all aspects. Unlike in other genres of cinema, horror is unique in the fact that actors rarely repeat themselves in a variety of films; therefore,  you can get some pretty low grade acting in the horror genre. EDEN LAKE has some of the best acting in it despite the unlucky fate it has being a typical horror movie. Another aspect that is really important in this movie is the tension that the movie has from beginning to end. Rarely do you find a film that keeps you white knuckle from the first 10 minutes to the end. To add on, the resolution to this film was marvelous. I was left thinking about it for days after I had watched it. I can not even explain to the complexity of how amazing the ending was, it left my jaw dropped like no other movie has before. I can largely contribute that to how well each character was developed. The end shined some light on the actions of the antagonists in the film. It gave depth to the characters that other slashers don't have. Another plus with the film is that all the holes were filled in by the end of the movie. This is a very stylistic choice, but in this movie it was very well thought out and had great purpose.CONS: With a movie as good as EDEN LAKE it was hard to find any flaws, however the one thing that I noticed that was bothersome was how the main actress almost always got found. IT'S THE FOREST! Hide, it's not that hard! This movie fell into the trap of forest horrors where the main actor always gets found when they shouldn't, but overall this movie was a successwww.chorror.com",Eden Lake
129,shannen-l-c,Not worth a 6.8 rating...,4,14 August 2018,"When I stumbled across Eden Lake on Amazon Prime, I did what I always do before watching a new movie and checked out the rating and reviews here on IMDb. I was surprised to see it had a 6.8 rating (which is very high for a horror movie) and a lot of positive reviews. However, intermingled with the good were as many bad. It seemed that people either loved this movie or hated it, so I was curious to watch and decide for myself which side I would take. It starts off like any other horror movie does - a young couple on their honeymoon at a lake in the UK. They butt heads with a bunch of rowdy teenagers at the lake and you can sense that there will be consequences of that. It follows the couple's battle for survival as the group of teens decide to take revenge on the couple for attempting to stand up to their bad attitudes and antisocial behaviour. First things first, the performances from all of the cast are strong. Although I was unfamiliar with all of the actors excluding Jack O'Connell (who plays the villainous teen, Brett), I was impressed with the cast and didn't feel I was watching amateurs as I often do with horrors. Putting the strong cast aside, there are few other positives to this movie. The pacing is slow and I found myself bored or uninterested for much of it. Furthermore, it felt incredibly unrealistic and the actions of the couple were illogical. As a viewer we're supposed to sympathise with the couple, but part of me couldn't because all I could think was that they'd brought it upon themselves. In their situation I wouldn't have conducted myself the way they did and I don't know many people that would. What it is useful in showing is the dangers of being confrontational and standing up to people like that. Often the safest and most sensible thing to do is NOTHING. Walk away and say nothing, that's the best way to stay safe in situations like that. But not this couple. The husband, in particular, charged in on multiple occasions and antagonised the teens. Furthermore, there are a couple of incidents that prove the teens are holding a grudge against the couple, yet the couple's actions remain stupid and illogical. They keep their tent in the exact same area they met the teens and the husband continues with his confrontational behaviour. All of this does make it hard to sympathise with the couple, because although no one deserves what happens to them, they had many opportunities to prevent what happens to them from happening. I can appreciate that the movie carries with it an important message regarding the apathy present in modern society and the devastating consequences of gang culture and peer pressure, and I believe this is where the positive reviews come from. However, despite the presence of those relevant and harrowing themes, nothing was done with them. It shows us that there are young people out there that are capable of atrocities but do not fully comprehend the seriousness or evilness of their actions and it shows us that even for those young people that are good at heart they are still capable of doing the most abhorrent things in pressurised situations. But it doesn't go deep enough with it. There's no valuable lesson or message embedded within the story. What makes kids this way? What are the consequences to their actions? What can be done to tackle this very real issue in our society? These are very important and valid questions, but the movie does nothing to address them. After a slow paced, dragged out plot the ending is incredibly disappointing. There is no pay-off for what happens and it left me feeling hollow and angry and once again questioning, WHAT IS THE POINT? It felt like I'd invested 2 hours of my life into a movie that had no real purpose or meaning. What's more frustrating is that it had the potential to be brilliant and creatively address the issues I've discussed above.Overall, I'm inclined to say after watching Eden Lake, I fall somewhere in between the good and bad reviews. I think it portrays very complex and relevant issues that impact us all in our daily lives, but it falls short of doing anything meaningful with it. Eden Lake is certainly not the worst horror movie I've ever seen, but is not one I'd watch again.",Eden Lake

So let's just say the time I spent watching this tragic farce is was a small portion of my life I want back. It doesn't even deserve a review (even if I could use the words I want) but my anger has to be vented somehow. Better a frivolous review than breaking something I own and adding to the loss seeing this film has already inflicted on me. The only reason I kept watching was to see the payback. How presumptuous of me. I figured all this torture would have some kind of resolution. My bad. Perhaps my mind is too accustomed to seeing the beaten protagonist reach a turning point and fight back ... and perhaps even win. But it's not the conclusion of the film that's got me ticked. I can deal with the that. Stuff happens. I get it. But to watch them stumble hopelessly, haplessly, cluelessly, from one predictable trap into another? And then finally trap herself in the bathroom.... WTF? Seriously? That's entertainment? What was the $%#&ing point? Hey, let's watch some people die? Was there some metaphor that I missed? Perhaps the gang of kids symbolize the filmmakers and the brutality of what happens to the doomed couple represents what the film is doing to the audience?

131,malcp,Like Shaun of the Dead without the funny bits,1,15 October 2009,"Chavs with regional accents do extreme happy slapping.I kept hoping that this would be a parody. It was predictable, stereotypical, and had a script so absolutely bloomin awful, I don't know how the cast managed to keep a straight face throughout. I checked the credits and it wasn't funded by Fox News or as a Sun comment on 'Broken Britain', so what is its excuse? The fact that people have seen this film and have seen it as anything other than contrived and predictable is far more disturbing than any of the gore on show. Unfortunately, once you look beyond it's facile exercise in vilely repugnant classism, you quickly realise just how naff this film really is. Swap the chav's for black people and it would be banned.

This is (in my opinion) way more down-to-Earth and believable than the American brand of weekend away gone wrong style of movie.It had me shouting at the screen. I hoped every one of those cruel vicious little wannabe gangsters would be executed slowly and painfully, but the only two that met their rightful fate were two minor instigators in the group. A young boy who was likely bullied by the ring leader and the girl who was likely being bullied too. As the movie progresses we find out that the parents and the adults of the family are just as bad, and their darling little angels are incapable of doing anything wrong in their eyes because ""they're just kids"". I have met many parents just like this, although their kids aren't murdering swines.Highly recommended.",Eden Lake
133,jery-tillotson-1,"Grim, Dark but Must See",3,6 November 2021,"I made the mistake of watching EDEN LAKE last night on my tablet just before I went to sleep. Big problem: I could hardly sleep. This grim, dark thriller was so stark and bloody that I hardly slept at all.The story is simple: a loving couple--played by Kelly Reilly and Michael Fassbinder--plan a getaway at a popular vacation area named Eden Lake. We know they're loving because there are several scenes of them loving each other, accompanied by loud kissing sounds as they make contact.But they incur the wrath of a small gang of thugs who are partying nearby and the Mr. Nice Guy asks politely if they could turn down their radio which they refuse to do. Big mistake number one.The thugs make it very clear they don't want him interferring with their beer drinking and cursing and threaten him.Instead of moving to a different part of the shoreline, our couple stays on--which is the major mistake number two.Very soon, our adorable thugs step up their brutality and our lovely couple are running for their lives. I won't give out the details here but soon the pranks become life-threatening as the thugs capture the couple, torture them with knives, box cutters, barbed wire, etc.The girl manages to escape and after several blood-curdling incidents, she finally makes it to the home where a party is going on. She's finally found safety--she thinks.Throughout this film, as I've felt in nearly all of these survivalist movies, I kept silently screaming for the heroine and the hero to find a weapon of some kind to protect themselves. This does happen--but usually too late. Although Kelly Reilly gives a bravura performance as the heroine, she merely winces and tears up towards the beginning when her lover is being roughed up and tortured. I think I would have done SOMETHING, like picking up a strong rock or a sharp tree branch or anything to help defend him.I didn't find unbelievable at all the terror of these young creeps. Here in the USA, our news showcases weekly incidents of where seemingly all-American kids casually murdering some school teacher or relative just because the killer got angry at something. The latest incident was of a son murdering his parents and brothers and sisters because the father and mother wouldn't buy him a new iPhone.This movie, though, was relentlessly grim, dark but suspenseful. Although you wished the young couple had used more common sense in dealing with these young terrorists, you admire the young girl FINALLY waking up and acting like a flawed heroine. Director James Watkins does an outstanding job in giving us this polished, beautifully edited and photographed nightmare that will stay with you for a long, long time.",Eden Lake
134,aqos-1,Must see,10,13 November 2008,"This is the best suspense movie I have seen since I don't know when. I wonder what the inspiration for it was. This is a movie that shows us that we should pay attention to the way we are raising our children and pay attention to who they are associating with. The kids in this movie were punks on bikes that just seemed annoying. The couple that fell victim were just trying to enjoy a quiet weekend. If the children had not been such punks, nothing would have escalated. Once things go wrong, you see the bully mentality of the gang leader making unwilling friends do things that go against their being. They were all too afraid of him to act against him as a group. The view into the father of the main boy proves that a bullied child will continue and be a bullier himself. I could not take my eyes off of this movie. I was well written and well plotted. The special effects of the injuries were very good and made you wince when you saw the extent of them. If you like suspense, this is the movie for you.",Eden Lake
135,seveleniumus,Dumb and dumber goes to UK,4,23 April 2010,"First lets talk about positive parts of the movie - directing is nice and movie looks and sounds really fine. That's pretty much it and while horror movies don't necessarily depend on pitch perfect psychology and character development in this case these criteria are extremely lacking and I just can't look past them. This supposed to be a realistic story guys, but it really isn't and the only explanation I could stick up to would be that main two characters here are complete morons and that's the main reason I can't really emote too much of feelings for things that are happening to them. Now let me be a little more specific and make sort-of a list of really stupid things which are happening in this horror flick.1. a gang of punks harass your wife, for hanging out in clearly their favorite local spot. What do you do? Come back to the same spot for more! The same gang is stalking you during the night time and you wake up to see that tire of your car is cut. What do you do? Come back to the same spot for more! and not only comeback - you decide to leave all your things behind unprotected and go for a swim. Moron!.2. You want to contact someone about punks cutting your tire(which by itself is pretty stupid idea, because you can't really do much about it without any clues, you're just a random stranger to locals and no-one will give a f*** about your troubles). What do you do? a) contact local authorities and find out if you can do something about it b) politely confront some of punks parents to see if they are willing to cooperate in any kind or c) let yourself in into someones private property and start to wonder around aimlessly just to be busted and forced to escape through the window. Moron!.3. Punks harassed your wife, cut your tire, stole your car and tried to run you over with it, then refused to give it back and then tried to ""shank"" you with a knife. You managed to wrestle the knife out of them and killed their aggressive dog in the process. You HAVE a knife and you HAVE them confronted. What do you do? Say ""I'm sorry"" , drop the knife and run. What the..? Just kick their asses, take your stuff and leave the place never coming back, what the hell. They're still just a bunch of punks, cut a little bit the most aggressive one and others will back off. I mean Jeez, why follow and confront them if you're not going to do anything with that, what joke, what a MORON.4. You managed to steal a car and escape the near death experience by killing some punks in the process. You HAVE a car and momentum on your side. What do you do? Go directly to their parents and ask for help. O-M-G! That's the stupidest thing I have seen character do in the horror movie by far and I have seen some B flicks where people walk into the room full of monsters and decide to close the door behind them selves before trying to escape. Why in the name of god would they help you? You killed their children! You think they'll listen to you? You think they'll believe you? Even if so, you think they won't choose to protect their family? You think they'll choose to give up their kids to authorities for some imaginary greater good for some foreign crazy looking woman, covered in some smelly stuff. Are you out of your mind? MORON!.Well these are my points and while I agree that dumb character logic is better than a dumb movie logic that doesn't change the fact that I can't relate to such a idiotic duo for what I can't feel in any way sorry for them and since movie mainly works on that perspective - it FAILS.",Eden Lake

137,bondgirl6781,"Intelligent, Intense, and Very Disturbing",8,6 October 2009,"Living in America I find it hard to believe that this film was overlooked while American theaters continue to release silly remakes and nothing original with regard to the horror film genre. I rented ""Eden Lake"" one night because I was in a Michael Fassbender mood and I was absolutely horrified by this film. Taking on the classic story line in the tradition of ""Deliverance"", ""House on the Left"", and ""The Lord of the Flies"", ""Eden Lake"" is the story of a happily in love young couple, Steve and Jenny, going away on holiday to a lake out in the country. Unfortunately they come across a group of aggressive and obnoxious teenagers who go out their way to pester and harass the couple. Steve and Jenny at first brush them off but all goes to hell when the teens steal their car and the couple attempts to confront them. James Watkins has stepped up to the level of Wes Craven and John Carpenter as a horror filmmaker. The film sets up the characters, Steve and Jenny, as the nicest and most polite people in the world. Michael Fassbender and Kelly Reilly give wonderful performances as the doomed couple. They made their characters vulnerable and sympathetic to the point that you really feel and fear for their safety. Jack O'Connolly, however, was pure masterful as one of the best horror film villains I have seen in years since ""The Devil's Rejects"". Brett, the leader of this pack of nihilistic teens is truly frightening because the character O'Connolly plays is very real! He is not possessed by the devil nor is a ""child of the corn"". Brett is the by-product of years of abuse and neglect. He is bred to be a violent animal like the rottweiler he walks around in the beginning of the film. The most disturbing scene is when Steve is being tortured by the gang because apart from the torture itself is the fact that Brett bullies and intimidates the weaker kids in the group to torture Steve. Some of these kids are very aware that what they are doing is wrong, but Brett makes it very clear of what he intends for the poor couple as well as his accomplices. He is the sociopathic alpha male of the group. I hope to see more of Jack O'Connolly as much as Michael Fassbender and Kelly Reilly. This film is truly a masterpiece in showing the decline of the underclass youth when not dealt with properly. Highly recommend this to horror film fans.",Eden Lake

142,Len9876,"A film for those who rank '8, 9, or 10 (out of 10)' for the use of anger and violence.",1,19 November 2008,"This film seems to be rated by its use of extreme violence. Those who allow the violence, whether they object to it or not, seem to rank the film the highest with an 8, 9 or 10 out of 10. Yet, the film introduces a series of issues it never resolves: illegally entering an area that has been bought by a developer (an area that was formerly a public park), the use of a boom box playing extremely-loud rap music, a couple that is extremely-intimate in front of under-the-legal-age children, and a legal-age male engaging in labeling or name calling (I believe the stereotypical term 'dick' was used). An equally-horrific scene is the killing of the children's dog. Whether the killing was an 'accident' or not, being 'sorry' for the killing is not adequate.Two or more wrongs, on either party, do not make a right. Granted, it was not right for the children to puncture the tire on, or steal, the couple's car. But, it is not right for the legal-age male to enter the children's home without permission. There is plenty, in this film, to incite both sides--and, thus, 'fuel the fire' (anger) and engage in violence. Both parties, at various times in the film, are persecutors. And, at other times, are victims.The rebellious children are at the age of defying authority. Couldn't the adult female, a teacher, see that? It seems that at least one member of the couple should have been able see that trouble was ahead, and they should clear out. But, after the children puncture the tires on the couple's car, they go back to Eden Lake for more--and further 'fule the fire' (anger) and the use of violence. The use of anger and violence, no matter on whose side, never solves a thing.Somehow, the film seems to side with the couple because they have 'squatter's rights', but the under-legal-age children (who also engage in anger and violence) have no 'rights'. The couple can be 'intimate' on private property, but the children can not play (loud) 'rap music' on the same piece of private property. I am not saying that the under-legal-age children are right for what they do, in the film, but there is a legal matter of both parties entering private property. If either party had respected the private property, the anger and the violence (depicted in the film) wouldn't have happened at all. By not respecting private property, both parties become persecutors and victims. As such, I can not find innocence on either side, and I rank this film a 1 out of 10. The children depicted in the film are 'rebellious', but the adults depicted in this film are 'brainless'. I am tired of films that continually glorify lust, anger, violence, and the 'gloom and doom'. Lust is not the same as sex, and sex is not a substitute for love. And, violence--even when shrouded in anger--is not a substitute for good acting, good direction, and a well-written script. This film justifies 'the ends' for 'the means', and ends up saying that the use of anger and violence is okay, if an immediate resolution cannot be found. Such a message is not only faulty, but is completely untrue.",Eden Lake

144,Onderhond,The Brits strike back,8,9 November 2008,"While European horror has been making quite a name for itself these last couple of years, the Brits have been lagging behind a little bit. There have been attempts, but none of them as good or solid enough to rival the best of France or Spain (and even Belgium). Then along came Watkins, raising the bar for all to follow.Eden Lake starts off same way many of his predecessors did. A young couple has planned a little hike to an idyllic lake, but the camping trip doesn't go exactly as planned. Rather than run into a vivid, hard to kill slasher, they meet up with a group of bratty kids. Nothing too scary, though Ils proved that even kids can be pretty mean when they want to be.While the film starts of pretty timid, even in these first moments a brooding undertone is already present. And when the group of kids makes their entrance, what follows is not hard to predict. Where Eden Lake shines though, is the way it escalates the situation. Inch by inch things take a turn for the worse and once the ball gets rolling, there's really no stopping what was started.It takes about another hour before the film reaches its climax, by then the film has delt several punches to the gut. While not exactly gory or gross, the happenings are pretty hard to stomach and are as chilly as can be. A typical British treat (think The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael) which feels pretty fresh in a true horror context.Visually the film is okay. Though not much attention is paid to framing pretty pictures, the camera work is effective in creating a menacing atmosphere. The forest makes for a good setting, allowing for lots of daylight filming without losing suspense and the make-up effects are juicy and believable. Watkins is also a master in not showing things, with the most horrible things actually happening off screen, still only increasing the effect.The soundtrack goes pretty much unnoticed throughout the first part of the film, but when nearing the climax Watkins sets up some nice melodies. Rather soft and delicate music, but a little distorted to suit and set the atmosphere right. Very smart use of sound there, with the song accompanying the end credits leaving me knocked out cold in my seat.The finale of Eden Lake is nothing short of impressive. Even though not every turn in the film is equally believable, the slow pace at which it builds towards its climax evens everything out, sucking you right in. Add to that great performances of Reilly and O'Connell (a completely and utterly unlovable prick) and some disturbing final events, and what you have is one, if not the best horror flick to come out of Britain for a long long time.While not as good as the best Europe has to offer, Eden Lake is a prime example of British harshness combined with good old-fashioned horror, increasing the insanity notch by notch and delivering a great finale. Every bit as intense as a film like this should be, deserving a very solid 4.0*/5.0*",Eden Lake
145,afrodome,Depraved & Heartless,4,1 August 2017,"There been many films where violence is heavily emphasized but it is either redeemed by a deep underlying message, or on the other end of this spectrum, is a got-to-the-core splatter film. In Funny Games, we as an audience are subjected to an overzealous social experiment on the dangerous notion that violence is entertaining, in Martyrs we are shown how selflessness and empathy can be brutalized but cannot be bought or broken, and in Men Behind the Sun we are shown before our eyes the historical horrors and atrocities that stem from warfare. Eden Lake is an incredibly sick movie. I cannot believe that a team of people wanted to actually create something so tragic and sad. I could even see people who enjoy I Spit On Your Grave being appalled by this movie. I would give it a 1 but the performances and camera-work were done very well. The plot caters to the lower-class sociopath stereotype that's a bit off-putting and the fact that they would want to go to this Eden Lake of all places is a bit bewildering.

I take small comfort, in that it was nowhere near as realistic, or socially aware, as people think it is. From it's RADA reject 'yoof' cast (and a complete waste of the usually great TURGOOSE) and it's disjointed plot (not to mention, all over the place character motivations) the movie still managed to sicken me.......sicken me, because people find this garbage interesting. Yes, i'm aware that some teenagers are mindless thugs, with little or no thought for human life, but this movie, was a check-list for 'cliche's' regarding lower class families. The (Hammer House Of Horror-style) adults (either, shagging, swearing, fighting drinking....or all four) was surely an after-thought, to attract the similar idiots who watch SHAMELESS....and the ""We look after our own"" ending was laughable (in a LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN kind of way)I'd read that other reviewers, thought the couple shouldn't have provoked the gang (i saw no provocation, other than confronting the gang, and asking for their car keys back) The killing of the dog, was merely 'self defence'.....and if the gang were as psychotic (as they were later portrayed to be) they'd have hardly:A) Been too bothered about a dog, anyhow.B) Given the couple a few minutes head start, before deciding to kill them.Also the geography was all over the place. Characters would wander around in various directions (through a huge wood) yet hear any minor sound, or happening , and arrive on the very same scene in seconds. The cop-out excuse, concerning the irrational behaviour of the youths, could be put down to the 'kids being very mixed up'....but i see it as nothing but lazy writing, from a team of (ahem) 'film-makers' capitalising on an already messed up country (and it's soft laws on young offenders) I see the director has writing credits for MY LITTLE EYE (another boring soul-destroying catalogue of pain and misery) and intends to write THE DESCENT PART TWO (wow, this guys got a vivid imagination)The add-lines for this (rancid) movie, state that it is (quote) ""One of the most provocative and terrifying thrillers of the year"".............The only thing i find 'provocative' is the 'terrifying' prospect, that people find this sh*te to be 'thrilling'?When you watch the news, and the newsreader reads about some horrible story about a murder, your heart sinks (allbeit, for a few seconds) you quietly 'tut' to yourself, and then (thankfuly) get back on with your own life.

148,luke-346,Hard hitting horror that's brutally close to home!,8,14 October 2008,"First and foremost, I found Eden Lake a breath of fresh air. The directorial debut for James Watkins offers a slice of contemporary life that is shocking and thought provoking. It is perhaps important for those seeing this film to know that Eden Lake is no titillating-horror, it is a different breed to the various torture porn films and plethora of supernatural films that seem to be doing the rounds. The film begins with a young couple, Steve (Michael Fassbinder) & Jenny (Kelly Reilly) venturing to a lake to spend a quiet weekend, only to have it interrupted by a group of rowdy youths. The behavior of the youths prompts Steve to have a word, provoking the adolescences into being confrontational, disrespectful and menacing. From here on in the couples weekend steadily degenerates into a contemporary nightmare that will touch the very sole of every British citizen.Various scenes and sequences in Eden Lake are shocking and during the screening two separate audience members got up and left. The deserting of individuals during a horror film can indicate the quality of the film; I like to think it's a good thing. I questioned one of the people that left and they told me that they found one particular scene too much to handle. The scene in question involved the goading of a teenager into committing an act of violence by a dominant youth. The beauty of Eden Lake lies in the fact that it takes root in the very essence of horror; it shows a world that is real and accessible; unlike a world of goblins, ghouls and zombies. The film is blatant in its attempt at tapping into contemporary societal fears; it investigates our fears of alienated youth and brutally incorporates that fear to expose our suppressed anxieties. Eden Lake depicts a world that is strikingly pertinent to the one in which live, making the film that much more disturbing. This is heightened by the scene in which we meet the parents; furthermore the ending is a chilling metaphor for ""like father, like son"".People have drawn similarities to ""Last House on the Left"" but it reminds me of, among others, the films ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""La Haine"" and although the gangs in those films were more organized all those films reveal a fringe of society that some of us choose to ignore, but that we all fear, and know, to exist. Eden Lake also had me thinking of many of the early 70's and 80's horrors that were often disturbing and shocking. Unfortunately Eden Lake isn't as good as those films of 30 years ago as I believe it to be too reserved. Examples of this lie in its treatment of racism - it's left up to the audience to decide, as nothing racist is muttered by any of the youths, only tenuously and cowardly alluded to by the filmmakers. The film also makes no real attempt to delve into the world of sexual humiliation or sexual torture, common place in many of the real-life crimes depicted in this film and often portrayed in many of the infamous horrors of previous decades. The language of the youths isn't that shocking, with their dialogue resembling some of the latter episodes of Grange Hill.Despite my gripes Eden Lake is a brave film, but it does on some occasions resort to clichés and cheap plot tactics. Several times I found myself questioning the behavior and motivation of various characters, which was a shame because it distanced me from the film thus leading to me feeling too removed. The acting isn't bad and I'm sure we'll see more of all of those on show, the script is OK but some of the dialogue is waning in parts.Eden Lake has been cited by some as a Daily Mail headline waiting to happen, something that beautifully and aptly sums it up. Although Eden Lake will not cause the controversy it deserves it will hopefully instill other filmmakers to raise the bar and push the envelope further. After all, it is only a horror film, and it fits that mould very well. If you are unsure of what constitutes horror or that recent horrors have deviated from the real-deal then go see it. Additionally, if you like to feel angry, upset and perhaps even fearful after seeing a horror then Eden Lake is the movie for you, ultimately it's a fine addition to the genre.",Eden Lake

150,amufan,Clearly something deeply wrong with the writer and director.,1,17 December 2020,"I chose to watch this movie because of Michael Fassbender, I don't remember when it came out so I have just recently watched it 12 years later, now I wish I never would've found it.The movie is suspenseful, a thriller and it is good versus evil, yes some of the sequences are repetitive and Long but you do still feel drawn into the characters and you grow to hate the Villains And route for the good guys. But then the writers, as many writers do in movies such as these, they take a decent movie with 90 minutes of suspense and in one fell swoop they destroy it with their ending. I know it is tuff to come up with a decent ending, to be creative and different than any other movie, but of all the choices and direction they could've went with this movie they chose the absolute worst one!I don't know if these writers and directors continued to do movies I haven't researched it but my suggestion is for all current and future directors and writers to watch this movie and if you decide that the writer and director of this movie did a good job on Their choice of ending, then please take a look in the mirror because there's deeply something wrong with you and save us all from having to watch any of your movies by picking a different career!For those that rated this movie higher than to question their morals I'm not a staff shirt I like a good slasher movie with very little meaning, but this movie clearly had a deep meaning and it was a meaning that should not have been taken lightly.For those that decide to watch this movie anyway, Then please when you get to the end and you realize how all the people that rated this movie two or less were right, then come back to IMDb and give this movie the ONE rating that it deserves. so that we can get that 6.8 down to where it should be, this movie does not deserve to be above a 2.",Eden Lake
151,Pigeon_down,A clichéd and unrewarding theatre group production,2,5 February 2017,"Wow, well that was a waste of my time. A UK film about a gang of children and one teen that attacks the worlds weakest couple in the local woods. The weak couple are easily overcome and seem incapable of finding a way out of said woods, despite the fact that about an hours walk in any direction in the UK puts you on a main road. It's impossible to find the kids credible. Yes kids can form gangs, but stabbing and burning bodies is somewhat of a stretch, albeit it remains a possibility. But this plty blunders from one moment of threat to another owing to the tired use of silly moves again and again by the couple trying to escape. Now, Fassbender and Reilly actually do a credible job, and if it wasn't for their presence you'd be watching a movie i'd suspect was written by kids who asked their parents if they'd appear in their school project. The ending is brutal, and this is one of those movies that became popular in the UK in the 70s where the bad guys win, and the contract with the viewer hoping to see redemption or escape and revenge is broken. All you end up watching is brutality, which serves no purpose in a world that we know is already brutal enough. This film has no redeeming element to the storyline. It's basically a rehash of a tired formula that is usually set someone in the deepest part of white trash inbred America who happen to come across the happy college campers and brutalise them.Perhaps i just don't get why they have to tell the same old story again, and again, and again, with the plot dependent on the ineptitude of the victims. The good news is, this was made in 2008 and there hasn't been a part 2 to drag it further in to the gutter. I love the horror genre, but this isn't a clever or remotely original idea (like say The Autopsy of Jane Doe), it's just another cheap slasher film.",Eden Lake

153,jflizard,Shocking but predictable,5,15 December 2011,"I've read several reviews of this movie before writing mine, and I kinda tend to agree with all of them, but only in parts.This movie is cruel, sadistic, and sometimes makes you feel sick. I don't like horror movies and I believe that many people got disappointed because it is not a regular horror movie. Scenes tend to be realistic, with situations that could really happen (this is the good part), but the idea behind making the plot realistic is ruined by some awful unrealistic situations, that many people have already talked about. So, in one hand, you have wounded people, blood, knifes, accidents, cruelty, and on the other hand you can never stop thinking ""why would anyone stay there after being provoked by a bunch of punks that were really determined to bring problems"". The bluetooth scene is idiotic, and well, the last 10 minutes of the movie really spoil everything, with the usual ""if anything can go wrong, it goes wrong"". Get a lift by the killer's brother, having an accident in front of a house that happens to be the killer's house and well, you see the picture.There are good things about it too, scary moments, moments where you feel sorry for the main characters, the violence scenes are realistic, the acting is reasonably good (even the kids)...This movie has no messages, it is not supposed to have, it doesn't have any kind of moral because it is not supposed to have. It is scary at times as it's supposed to be... but it has some idiotic moments that makes you want to laugh. Thing is, you won't laugh because even if the story is not realistic, it's violence is.",Eden Lake
154,mecheart,A watered down iteration of a watered down modern genre,1,21 May 2013,"I remember when HORROR movies dared us to go in the woods for fear of indestructible masked undead psychopaths who wielded machetes and took no prisoners. Apparently, that era is ending in the replacement of said immortal lunatics with ... get ready to be horrified ... children. Yes, children. Not zombie children, but living, breathing brats capable of committing the same level of atrocity as Jason, Michael or old Mad Man Mars. Pertinent I feel to my level of dislike for this film is that I am American, a military veteran, and one who grew up running around in the woods building forts and camping in them overnight from an early age. Was I bullied as a kid - yes. Did I outgrow my teen tormentors and come in to my own - also, yes. The point being, that perhaps as a youth the sight of a small gang of tween and teen punk bullies would have caused me some discomfort. But as an adult similar in age to the male protagonist? Don't make me laugh.I find these types of pseudo horror slashers very tragicomic although for the genre itself and not the protagonists who star in them. Replacing monsters with children as the threat in a so called horror film? Such just enlarges the egos of the legion of online gaming tweens and teens who from behind their parents' keyboards build fictional criminal killer personalities in cyber land that apparently make them feel more potent than their growing meager muscle mass allows.Eden Lake is a film that wants us to fear children. Why? I suppose because they may ""get"" you the next time you head into the woods. Others have defended the film by claiming such a premise makes ones sense of disbelief easier to suspend versus a supernatural horror threat. I feel exactly the opposite. Eden Lake is another entry in a growing sub genre of films such as 'Funny Games' and 'The Strangers' - all of which seek to flabbergast, anger and shock us with the hidden sociopathic violent potential of our children. What they evoke in me at least is anger at their writers and producers. Forget Jason, forget Mike Myers ... Freddy too. Don't go in them woods I say, or the Evil Kids will get you. Drivel of the lowest order. Please spare yourself the emotional currency.",Eden Lake
155,BloedEnMelk,Realistic and brutal.. great UK thriller!,9,27 January 2011,"There are horror movies that kind of amuse me, and there are horror movies that make me feel really uncomfortable. Eden Lake belongs to the second category.Though the plot isn't a very original one, it is very well worked out and it is definitely the realism that brings this movie to a higher plane. It's easy to root for the soon-to-be-terrorized couple and it's also very easy to put yourself in their position. Eden Lake shows the reality of how quick things can get really out of hand and how everything can turn into a nightmare before you know it. Peer pressure plays a big part in that, and makes this movie feel very real. I will not say too much more about Eden Lake. But if you can stand a gruesome roller-coaster, which takes you through a whole range of emotions, and you can take the realism and blood, than this is an excellent movie. Movies I can compare this with are the original 'Last House on the Left' and the Australian movie 'Wolf Creek'.",Eden Lake
156,running_with_scissors,A new entry for Worst Endings!,4,4 November 2008,"I was really enjoying this movie and felt really cheated by such a poor climax. It would have been much more satisfying if she had continued to go all-Rambo and slice up the meanest of the chav scum. I was honestly anticipating the moment when they got what was coming to them and to be robbed of that moment was very disappointing.Also when you give your victims a chance to capitilize on their situation then you loose any care you might have had for them. When Steve killed the dog, he had a chance to put an end to it there and then, that's a scene that can destroy any emotional interest you have in characters when it's their own stupidity that leads to their downfall.That can easily be overlooked, but unfortunately that ending just ruined the movie completely for me.",Eden Lake

The movie is fast-paced and perhaps well acted too but the violence is pretty high and at times looks meaningless.Though I do agree the movie has raised the issue of teenage violence but no solution is been provided to the problem instead of ruthless killings.Overall despite of weak storyline you may relish the good visuals and direction.",Eden Lake

The thing about that the movie that ""scares"" people would be children who are not old enough to put in to prison but are old enough to understand that the way they behave have no consequences what so ever for them. It give you very little respect for any justice system and not much hope for humanity. Watching children behave like this and the parents who can't/wont put a stop to it only makes you hope for at breeding license for humans one day, certain people shouldn't be allowed to have children.Sadly though it's just a bad rip-off of the French/Romanian film ""Ils"", I'd advice people to watch that one instead.",Eden Lake

160,iSkyWalKing,"Dark, Bleak, Dreary... Good Horror",8,12 February 2017,"What a strange film.. I can't say there is anything revolutionary or new to add to the genre here (although there is a slight twist to that), but great none the less...If horror is what you're after then horror is what you'll get. It's fairly straight forward in that regards. It starts off very up-beat and is very scenic. It soon takes a dark turn and it becomes a grind from there on. It is tough to sit through at times (which is what I want from a horror - I don't watch horror for upbeat vibes and happy endings). It gets very bleak and very disturbing as the film spirals toward it's end. It gave me a mild sense of claustrophobia for some reason at times which is nice considering they are in the woods most of the time. A sense of hopelessness lingers and you basically have no choice but to endure it.Simple formula but done well enough in my opinion with enough new elements to keep the movie interesting the entire time..I was never bored, was extremely frustrated at times and even a little shocked at times (which is a rarity for me). It is dreary and bleak and seems senseless but such is the world we live in..There are no supernatural elements & there are no jump scares if that is your thing.. it is horror grounded in reality. There are elements of horror, torture, suspense and leaves an overall sense of discomfort & frustration. It is very dark, dreary and hopeless..That being said, it is not perfect of course. There are moments which will have you wondering why characters do what they do, but then again.. I can suspend disbelief because people all react different and irrational during extreme high stress situations. It's good to always keep that in mind with this genre. Making decisions from the comfort of your couch while snacking on Doritos is a lot different than being in a tense life and death situation. Remembering that makes specific movies more enjoyable and seen for what they are. The series of events might not make sense to YOU specifically, but nothing in life really does and people do all kinds of strange things to one another and behave in odd ways especially when that fight or flight kicks in...As far as motives, I didn't need any for the same reasons mentioned above.So if you are looking for a quality horror movie to add to your list then Eden Lake should fit right in...",Eden Lake

162,ReelBrew,A couple find themselves terrorized by a group of local teenagers and quickly realize their idyllic vacation becomes a fight for survival.,5,22 November 2015,"For decades now hikers, couples, campers, corpses, journalists, and soldiers have been getting lost in the foothills of the world, only to be terrorized by the unforeseen or the unknown. It's nothing new to see the sun go down and the various goalies come out as bewildered victims clamor about in search of refuge and hope. For the most part it has only really been tackled with a certain lightness, or air of the unknown. In 2005, Eli Roth helped change that with Hostel, his torturous romp through a fictional Slovakian town in which the real ghouls of the night are the men in thousand dollar suits; the ones whose hands we never see dirty, and faces we want to trust. What Hostel did was harken back to a day when films like Maniac, or The New York Ripper were released, playing off the minutia of peoples everyday lives, putting fear in the idea of talking to strangers. While Eden Lake certainly puts a match to the don't talk to strangers mentality, it comes up short on delivering what justice is deserved; all we are left with is a muddled feeling of bitterness, a feeling that just sits there long after the credits roll.Taking place in the dense trails of England, near a soon to be covered reservoir, Eden Lake places us in the middle of Steve (Michael Fassbender) and Jenny's (Kelly Reilly) weekend getaway, in which Steve plans to propose. Before he gets a chance though, a group of local kids begin terrorizing them, disturbing their romantic and secluded destination. Taking things to the next level, the leader of the gang Brett (Jack O'Connell) decides to steal their vehicle, cell phones and wallet, prompting Steve to confront them. What starts out as ""boys being boys"" quickly turns deadly as the leader of the pact begins a game of cat and mouse between the unsuspecting couple, putting their relaxing vacation on hold. What Eden Lake does exceptionally well is tension. Director and writer James Watkins shifts each scene so seemingly between unrequited romance and tangible tension you'll swear you've lived each moment yourself. In one particular scene, Steve approaches the group of kids asking them to turn their music down. A dog barks against the blare of hip-hop. Boys chuckle and spit in contempt. Eyes penetrate from every angle. It's a scene that oozes with a calm, pulsating chaos; one that will have you recalling every moment of confrontation you've ever experienced. What follows suit attempts to slice the same path, only carving it with a completely different set of tools, unfortunately coming up a bit dull.With the cat and mouse game in full effect and first blood drawn, the dread that surrounds the couple begins to permeate with every encounter; it's clear that Brett and his gang don't plan on leaving anyone alive. With tensions mounting, we begin to establish sympathy for Steve and Jenny, rooting for their success in evading a terrible fate by the hands of cruel teenagers. What this style of horror excels at, and ultimately falters over is its insatiable appetite and desire to step over a set formula; a formula that allows for a sliver of hope or chance, giving us the revenge our dreaded heroin needs. Focused so heavily on bringing us the grizzly terror of being secluded, unguarded, and outnumbered, Eden Lake offers us almost nothing redeemable with characters. In what could have been an incredibly creative revenge plot in the second half of the film, giving us the reward of investing in these characters, we are swiftly dragged through more of the same. Instead of playing off all the elements it contains and giving us a worthy story like 2005's The Descent, we are shown what comes off more like a pamphlet seeped in foreboding messages and deathly warnings, coming up empty handed. Building magnificent tension with a charming, inviting and ultimately foreboding beginning, Eden Lake shows essences of films such as Deliverance and The Descent, opening itself up to great potential. What it does is stick with a rather one-dimensional pattern, showing more of a concern with violent methods than it does storytelling. After giving us tension with such ease in the first act, it forgets its audience can begin to lose interest if that tension isn't used and manipulated, shaped and molded. While certainly a film with a beautiful skeleton thanks to cinematographer Christopher Ross, Eden Lake essentially contains the scraps of other stories, too busy showing us its sociological concern than telling it.",Eden Lake
163,pete-murphy97,Pure horror without the trimmings,9,6 January 2018,"When Stephen Taylor (Michael Fassbender) invites his girlfriend, a kindergarten teacher Jenny (Kelly Reilly), to spend the weekend in Eden Lake, a paradisaical and remote place in the woods, the best laid plans of mice and men go very awry.Eden Lake is a full-on horror flick that delivers the goods; well-shot, brilliantly acted, an engaging script that never loses focus, great pacing, great suspense, and for once is a film that does not give the audience what they want or expect. Because that's the whole theme, that what we want or expect from life; an idealistic relationship, a perfect getaway, seeing only the best in people - is not real. i.e. 'boys being boys', or a man being a 'man or a mouse'; when we rule in absolutes we suffer, when we only see what we want to see we suffer. This film is a bitter tale of idealism going kaput, it is a masterfully crafted cinematic hit piece on Hollywood's box-office-swelling happy endings and feel-good plotlines, where love is lovey-dovey, mom and dad are just mom and dad, and kids are just kids; this film, quite rightly, wants to make a statement, it wants to divide opinion and challenge our ideas. Many won't, and don't take kindly to that.The bias in cinema is to give the audience a comforting outcome, one that instills hope and optimism - and we all want that, of course we do; but do we need that? Is sugarcoating everything really helping us to become more sensible, empathetic humans as real art should strive to do? This film shows us that too much of anything can make you sick.The bottom-line moral of the story; two lovers entwined, intoxicated by their mutual affection lose touch with the reality of the world around them.This ties into the setting itself, the paradisaical 'Eden Lake':The lake is an ex-quarry, a building site, a man-made scar on the earth is their romantic setting. Very ironic how they only see a beautiful lake, but the history of this beautiful location is man-made force, disruption, and financial gain. The lake itself is its most recent, and outwardly innocent, iteration - it is an intentional imitation of natural beauty, and a fitting motif that features throughout the film.The name of the lake, 'Eden', is Biblical of course, a place of paradise and beauty, sure, but also where the knowledge of good and evil resided. Eden resided in a place of abundance in the Bible. In the film, the fact the lake was once a quarry suggests that this natural abundance is gone, this is a bad sign from the start.""And out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.""
Genesis 2:9They constantly return to the location to pursue their love despite the dangers presented to them. They had knowledge of good and evil; (the evil being the disruptive youths, the the good being their romantic break) yet their mindless romance became their greatest downfall.Honeymoon effect: 'I don't care where as long as I'm with you' as stated by Stephen, their love is a disconnected, romantic bubble, while this seems like an innocent quote is ties into the overarching theme, that where they are is irrelevant to him, when it should be absolutely relevant.Some people say the characters are too simple and that they make unrealistic decisions. 
I believe this is for artistic effect, the two lovers are very typical, but they are not wooden by any means; the fact they are portrayed as they are tells me this could be any couple. It is less about the individuals and more about the message their characters offer overall; love-struck, head-over-heels, and wholly misled because of it.I write this review nearly a decade on from its release, but the film has not lost its message in that time, nor will it into the future. 
Eden Lake is a standout film, an independently-minded work of art that is unafraid to push boundaries, to stretch our comfort zones, and to challenge our views of the world. A must see.9.3/10",Eden Lake

I don't mind movies where the antagonist(s) ""wins"" in the end. Take ""The Devil's Rejects"" as an example of a film where this premise works. I watched ""Wolf Creek"" and it has the same feeling as ""Eden Lake"" where they emotionally invest you in the main characters and you feel like you went through what they went through only to see all hope dashed and evil win.To me that is a waste of time. Make a person care and then p*ss them off in the end. A person should get some kind of pay-off when they watch a film and if that pay-off is straight out anger towards the film itself then nothing can save the good graces that the film already established.I'm not saying that depressing, bleak, dismal endings don't work because they certainly do.

This is a beautiful movie transcending genres and reaching out to the best in all ages. It helps teach the futility of resistance. How fighting back is just tiring, how running just rips your clothes and can ruin your mascara. And just how naughty kids can be some days. Tut,tut,tut! And now for the moral lessons. A) If you're out for the day with a group of kids and you're a kid, be sure to bring your knife. B) If something isn't nailed down, steal it. C) If you have a choice between doing good or evil, do evil. It's just so much more fun. d) Any chance you have to hurt another person is okay, providing the group of you can rely on winning. You're not emotionally developing properly unless you torture and kill. E) If you're hesitant as to whether you should let yourself be persuaded to join in the depravity, don't waste time, just dive right in.Seriously, a lot of talent was wasted on this film. It's course is just perverted into a message of violence and utter hopelessness. Kids get another lesson in administering violence without consequence. The best of the kids are killed off. The single dark skinned child in the movie is burned alive with a tire around his neck and his head in flames. Was that just thrown in so the KKK could reminisce on this side of the pond? Was there anything in this movie designed not to appeal to the worst in all of our natures from child to adult?How soon before we're hunting down children instead of protecting them? Where are the morals in this piece of filth? What single redeeming quality did it at last show in its ending?Kids will watch this movie, and cheer the group on. Adults will be just a bit more inclined to drive on by when seeing a child in trouble, instead of trying to help. Maybe Texas can use it to lower the death penalty even further.If you have to make a movie like this why make it so uniform in its bleak, depressing outcome. The hunted die. The weak die. The greatest sadist wins out and we leave him admiring his new sunglasses while his Dad and their neighbours murder a woman in the downstairs toilet.This story has no redeeming quality. It's influence is negative, and it's still more BS if claims continue that this type of crap does not have negative implications on what kids watching it - and there will be many kids watching - think about the culture of violence our world is cultivating without equal.If the makers of this film had a conscience, they should have watched what they'd given birth to and then destroyed it. To think that they're making money and garnering fame which encourages them to make more of the same, makes me sick.If it doesn't make you sick, you should think again. In a world of violence where even our so-called civilised democratic countries are engaged in murdering people half a world away, this is what we have to offer?If you wonder where God is in all this, consider this. He's done what we've asked of Him. He's hiding. For the atheists reading this and dismissing the whole comment because of the mention of any deity, for the last time listen. Murder through the modern ages and today is not based on religion - it is based on the perversion of religion, both Christian and Muslim, the twisting and bastardaization of what was intended into a perverted justification for men to engage in their other most basic inclinations, their overwhelming greed and their unending thirst for power.

176,YasheshJ,A gruesome hoodie horror/thriller set in the British backwoods.,8,12 June 2013,"For a weekend getaway, Steve (Fassbender) and his girlfriend Jenny (Reilly) visit an outback quarry-lake before the beautiful surroundings are devoured by an upcoming urbanization, forever. Enjoy their time away from civilization; the reverie is suddenly broken by a bunch of rowdy kids lead by a yobbo, Brett (O'Connell). Quite evidently, Brett is used to have things his way, by hook or crook, by bullying or beating.The group starts monkeying around with the couple and it soon turns into ugly coquetry. Shocked at this vulgar behavior of some teenagers, Steve confronts the group but immediately retreats on account of incessant mocking and insults hurled at him--coming especially from Paige (Finn Atkins).The group further besets the couple by stealing their belongings/car and stranding them at night in the middle of a jungle. To get his belongings/car back, Steve's second encounter with the kids results into violent clashes and Brett unleashing his belligerent bitch on him. Accidentally, Brett's dog gets killed and all hell breaks loose. Now, the infuriated group tries to murder the couple. Steve and Jenny somehow manage to escape and begins the game of cat-and-mouse, followed up with plenty bloodbath and torture.Film does sounds like any other survival-thriller but atmosphere is quite electric, build up is great, and the climax sequence literally 'screams horror' in your face--even sans the gore. You feel for Reilly and yearn for that sweet revenge, with clamped fists and gritty teeth. Alas! might just be out of reach.Toward the end of film (signs were there even earlier) we realize these demented children can actually be attributed to reckless parents and messed-up upbringing in a malevolent society/environment.Fassender is not in his usual impactful, meaty role. It is Reilly and O,Connell who really steal the show here. O'Connell hardly seems to be portraying a character. All that hatred and hostility seems quite inherent--I call that brilliant acting.Direction is top notch. I am pretty sure Watkins isn't trying to belittle any indigenous community through this film--just showcasing what can happen in any part of the world under similar circumstances. He perfectly captures the intricacies of how immorality continues to survive and thrive.8/10",Eden Lake
177,gazzalere,There's only one reason I'm reviewing this movie..,4,17 September 2008,"OK so I've been a member of IMDb.com for a while now and because I'm a filmmaker myself I normally only review movies which I thought were good or deserved a review to get more people going and watching them, I'm about to review this movie for one reason only and that's because I don't actually agree with it.OK so the name for starters, ""Eden Lake"" it sounds like a pleasant name for a place, not entirely sure it makes a good name for a movie but everyone to their own. Let's move onto the movie itself. I went to see this movie thinking I'm going to see yet another horror movie about teenagers being stalked by a group of serial killers but in fact while watching the images being thrown in my face they're too close for comfort! Apart from the film being too close to comfort the film in a way also touches on one racist act of terror which I don't think should have been in the film especially in the way it was portrayed! In my opinion I honestly don't think this film should go to DVD mainly because it comes across as if it's OK for teenagers/gangs to attack innocent people, and after all the knife crime and random killings currently sweeping the United Kingdom it would of at least been in the interest of the families who have lost family members over the past few weeks that this film should have been held back or not even made in the first place.I'm sorry for the negative review but I honestly can't think of any other way to talk about this film other than I don't agree with it and the filmmakers have gone a little too far this time round.",Eden Lake

In reality, the character, Steve, did too many things wrong. I kept shaking my head at his decisions and thinking that all of this could have been avoided if he had just done things differently.Already the storyline wasn't great, but I decided to watch it further just to finish. What kept me from finishing the last 30 minutes, was the gore. I am usually okay with it, but this is the prime example of what I can't stand. Close ups of the injuries being made. If it had been quick, I could have finished, but the scenes were drawn out and made me uncomfortable.This may be a movie that someone else would enjoy, but not for people, like me, who want a stronger story and less gross scenes.",Eden Lake

Some movies are clearly fictitious, morally it's easy for me to enjoy what's on the big screen. Some are not... Starting back a few years ago, imho, the story and the setting gradually migrated into something more and more realistic. This way audience gets confronted with voyeurism... that's what I would call a moral dilemma... some movies (e.g. hostel) chose a real-world setting with a (hopefully) fictitious story... others, like this one, gives us a feeling like it could happen anytime and anywhere... This movie may be considered as horror or thriller... just suspense... It also opens space for social reflection. Projection of fears from within our world, our society...

Chav horror. Maybe the start of a new British sub-genre - Chavorror? In fairness the themes of ""broken Britain"" make a refreshing change in a horror flick. No chainsaws here, these lads wear hoodies, like a bit of ""happy slapping"" and carry their mobile phones about like life-support machines. You can doubtless meet most of them down McDonalds any weekday afternoon.However its this very Britishness which doesn't gel with survivalist horror. A man-made lake somewhere ""up north"" is not the stuff of nightmares. And why, oh why, would a couple even want to go there for a romantic getaway? What next, a trip round the Sanatogen works in Salford armed with a Harrods picnic basket? Yes, the class issue is here. And it's all rather smug. The heroes, an affluent middle-class couple, meet a bunch of insane yobs, who are of course all working-class northerners.That's the dubious politics out of the way, now on to the main failings of the film. It's really difficult to get lost anywhere in Britain unless you're in the middle of Dartmoor or up a mountain. And these two aren't.

You expect the protagonists to die and so they do. It is the antithesis of suspense. No development of the characters, no closure,no denouement, nothing. Nada. Nyet.

191,DelBongo,Fantastique,9,13 November 2008,"This gruelling, invigorating, sensational tour de force is an instant classic. It takes most of its cues from the much-revered smash-mouth genre prototypes of the 1970's; its whole-hog relentlessness, its shrewd, methodical plotting; both are pure, vintage Wes Craven, and praise doesn't come much higher than that.It's a thoroughly old-school experience from beginning to end. The much-discussed topicality turns out to be nothing more than simple provocation, and the whole thing is shamelessly, rigorously manipulative, in that brilliant way that horror films used to be. When I wasn't squirming in my seat, I was trying to stop myself from yelling at the screen (a process that I like to refer to as ""decision derision"") which is the kind of impassioned, joyous impulse that I haven't succumbed to in a cinema in years.But make no mistake, this is ferociously, unflinchingly hardcore. It is frequently nasty in ways that go straight for the gut, and bears no relation to the f*ckwitted idiocy that Hollywood now regularly churns out disguised as something challenging or extreme. If you thought that Hostel was tough, think twice before buying a ticket.Eden Lake may not have the rich subtext or cultural significance of Craven's seminal 1970's output, but it does unmistakably have that same raw cynicism, energy and sense of purpose.This is easily the finest pure horror movie since Switchblade Romance, and is absolutely not to be missed.",Eden Lake

194,DeadeGuard98,"A Couple, A Retreat and The Teens",7,9 June 2020,"😱 First Impressions:
What I have seen time and time again are films where people go to a recreational space (that's about to be closed down or built on) that lo and behold, tragedy strikes. I have never seen however, a horror movie where teens were the menace (except the ones with drama and bullying set in a high school). So I figured, it's not going to be that bad- or rather how much worse could it get!?Pros:
😋 It started with minute uneasiness about parenting concerns and then kept a sustained level of dread from when the couple first meets the teen gang up until the latter terrorizes them. Before racking up that tension into torture porn territory. You will never feel safe watching this film and I almost broke down emotionally, these teens are something else!!😋 The actors playing the couple are by no means groundbreaking but still phenomenal. During the good times, they are playful and happy. Then as the situations became more dangerous and threatening, they grew fearful and scared... Despite Steve showing some stern behaviour- I believe that's more of a facade, one that did not work against these rotten apples. Jen is more calm and patient, but even she has their limits.😋 Plot-wise was nothing special. The death before properly proposing has been seen many times before. What I found it most intriguing andvvery ironic was that Jen who is a nursery teacher that has to deal with the fact that educating children can only go so far and I bet had she lived; she would very much consider a career change. The rest of the socialisation process still relies on the household environment and the parents' nurturing or lack thereof. It's a fear that I one day would have to face as well (should the opportunity arise).
lCons:
😪 The ending is total brutality! Like I've said countless times before, good should prevail or at least have a bittersweet ending. Not one where the baddies prevail by a landslide. The first house that Jen runs into after hijacking the siblings of one of the teenagers is also the soiree of the teens' parents- who also hang together, what a coincidence!!So what the film is conveying that there is no justice when it comes to teen violence and crime; whose parents help to cover up after a brief exchange of thoughts. Which is a very bad and lazy message to send... Why should they get a pass?😪 One last thing the portrayal of teenagers, from the working class no less- as demented and chaos bringing bunch (though there were some exceptions) is an overgeneralisation. I noticed that critics have also brought this up because this film caused a controversy of sorts by trying to convey the 'Broken Britain' and rising worries over teen criminality. I do agree to an extent, but the biggest issue I felt again was partly because of the ending which then involved the parents aiding and abetting instead of doing the right thing.😇Verdict😈
Eden Lake could have been more than just a solid thriller and enduring moral about the consequences of parenting as well as a lack of monitoring. Instead it encounters the pitfalls of having too much violence over substance. The resolution of the narrative is rushed and it makes everything the couple suffered through pointless just to illustrate some wildly innacurate stereotypes of middle class teens and that is all that will mostly be remembered.",Eden Lake

196,Lifexinxrewind,Another somewhat underwhelming horror fest entry.,6,2 April 2010,"Eden Lake is, at best, an average been there-done that horror affair. It has its moments from time to time that convey a good sense of tension, and the film is competently made, but too much of the screenplay suffers from frustratingly obvious plot holes and contrivances to warrant a recommendation. I can only assume that I've simply seen more horror movies than many who have reviewed this one before me because the ""villain"" in the film has certainly been done before and the ""shocking ending"" was anything but. It's come to the point where I'm almost shocked if an independent horror movie doesn't employ this kind of ending. When both people in the room can call specific details of the ending way in advance I wouldn't exactly call it ""shocking."" There was also way too many times where the main characters act in the almost exact opposite of what would be considered the logical thing to do, all in order to further the plot and put them back into danger. It's hard to root for characters that act this nonsensical. Examples include standing up out of your hiding spot when the killer is scanning the woods for you, or apologizing after defending yourself against multiple assailants. Or, as another reviewer pointed out, at one point the sadistic killer decides to go out of his way to throw away a scrap of paper in a garbage bin in the middle of the woods, just to provide suspense to the audience who knows the main character is hiding in said dumpster. There were far too many times this movie could have ended easily but needed a ridiculous coincidence or terrible decision to further the plot, all in the name of being mean spirited.

197,dvd123,One Dimensional,3,9 November 2008,"If you're looking for a glimpse into lower class English youth sadism... this is it. In that sense it almost plays like a documentary. If you're looking for more than that, though, I'd go elsewhere. A Clockwork Orange, for instance, covers similar territory, but, thanks to the brilliance of Kubrick, ventures so much farther. That brilliance, alas, cannot be found here.Spoiler: A naive dimwitted couple vacationing in a remote area stirs up a hornet's nest of sadistic youth. The kids kill the man, the girl kills a couple kids, makes her way to civilization, only to be killed by the kid's parents.They stretch it out with plenty of tiresome chases and even more gratuitous sadism, but that's the core. Does that sound like a fantastic movie to you? This kind of movie could only be made in Britain, as any Hollywood producer listening to this pitch would laugh in their face.If you need a dose of locals gone loco, go check out Deliverance. If you need sadism (or therapy), it's not the best movie, but Hostel is better than this. To be honest, just about any woods based horror flick is better than this- even Wrong Turn.I will give it credit for one thing. It's very simple. A ten year old could probably follow the plot. There's no B story, no humor, no soundtrack, no CGI and no sets. And the acting is somewhat believable.Overall, though, it's a 15 minute story trapped in a 90 minute movie.",Eden Lake

The negative reviews express outrage at how brutal the movie is and complain about plot holes and unrealistic character decisions and plot twists; perhaps these people are a little too delicate if they are so offended by a movie and the issues of plot holes and character decisions are overstated. Some of the positive reviews seem to read a little too much into the movie, suggesting it is some kind of clever comment on society. The movie is not ground-breaking, but it is well done for what it is, with good acting and pacing. It does ask you to swallow a rather large coincidence at the very end for the sake of it's kidney-punch finish and I can understand a lot of reviewers' frustrations with it. For me, it was watchable and not a bad movie, certainly not offensive to me as a viewer - if you want to watch a bad, offensive movie for comparison, watch Fractured with Sam Worthington.

I can't believe how many people are giving this a bad rating simply because it doesn't have a happy ending. It just goes to show that the average person WANTS to be repeatedly fed predictable and formulaic entertainment. And those of us who appreciate this film it doesn't imply that we like watching people get tortured without consequences. It means we're able to give this film the credit it deserves for taking us through so many raw emotions to the point that at the end I was literally mean mugging the character on the screen. I wanted to personally kill that boy I was FURIOUS... and I can assure you that the writers, directors, etc. were very deliberate in drawing that reaction out of me and THAT means they did their job. As reality hit me that this was just a movie so did the reality that the good guy doesn't always win.None of this is to say this movie is perfect and some of the negative reviews pointed out various imperfections but there are reviews literally titled ""This is a mean movie"" and their ONLY gripe is that the bad guys got away. Almost EVERY negative review still manages to complain about the ending, the violence, or claim that it glorifies the actions of very disturbed kids. Listen this movie doesn't glorify what those kids did JUST because they didn't get what they deserved Somebody wrote ""justice should be present in every movie."" Are you people serious?!?! Furthermore nobody is saying ""violence is cool""  it's just a different outcome from the horror movie recipe that people are used to which just PROVES the average person DESIRES predictability and staying on the safe side. Which is dumb because MOST of the time the bad guy kills 99% of the cast before he's killed and only one MAYBE two people get away. But since THESE guys get away with it all of a sudden the movie is promoting sadism and deserves a ONE? REALLY?!

202,LuckyMatt93,One of the best horror movies in years,10,22 June 2009,"It's safe to say that Eden Lake is one of the best horror movies from this decade. It has some incredible scares and it's very atmospheric. But the expertly executed tension and pace really makes Eden Lake stand out. I was skeptical during the first 30 or so minutes. I was beginning to think I was in for another run-of-the-mill horror film, as there wasn't much about the proceedings that was differentiating it from everything else. But slowly, the film started to draw me in, and soon I found myself utterly consumed with the cat-and-mouse game being played out on screen.It hits you on a psychological level just as much as it will on a visceral one. It does an excellent job of being very disturbing and affecting without being overly gratuitous. Only a few horror films today have mixed gore and psychological terror perfectly, like for example The Descent, the Saw series, Inside, etc.Eden Lake also has a bit of social commentary, and its focus is put squarely on the unruly youth of today. While it may have more bite in its native land, it's an issue that will resonate anywhere. Luckily however, the script is smart enough to not just rest on the laurels of all kids being troublemakers; it does try and dig into the root of the problem, and at the end of the day conveys a nice ""violence breeds violence"" message. In addition, the movie deals with the dangers of peer pressure and finding yourself amidst a bad crowd.Britain seems to be at the top of it's game with horror movies. 28 Days Later, The Descent, Mum and Dad, and now this gem.",Eden Lake

This movie is not the reality, this will drive you deep feeling the anxiety, depression farer and farer from the reality a world which has no truth has no respect and has no solution. Everything just drive you more far to the fairless world until the evening, where you expect to have some sort of solution. Even the movie over nothing is over and it keep you back under shiver. There is no justice at all, no judge. A horror movie never logical, how something like alien or CUBE etc can be logical. Just watch this movie from the start until the final second... If you are not feeling the anxiety you might be psychopath / sociopath.I am very sad and see the rating of this movie and couple other in this genre, totally underrated and misunderstood. This title best in the get totally lost in it feel the unfair atmosphere... It will lead you in overthinking what and how should have happened.Just to compare some rough recent mindless horror Heredity got almost 8 point for literally 0 touch with your soul, and this movie is about 6, sky and ground in reality.",Eden Lake
206,bricslove,This is not a horror tale. This is real. Stone cold. Intends to disturb and for good reason.,8,9 August 2018,"That reason being the movie's ability to call people out on their apathy and ignorance-is-bliss attitude. Viewers are of different types. Some do not have fun watching certain movies, but they still value those movies. I am one of those viewers.What viewers like me enjoy is that there is someone who is out there and as disturbed by the growing apathy in society as we are and by the fact that we haven't been doing much about it. The following are masterfully shown in the movie sporadically or throughout:-the apple does not fall far from the tree, sickness breeds sickness.-needing a sense of belonging makes you vulnerable to sickness. caving in to peer pressure is also a very real problem. and most important of all,-that this is a vicious circle unless enough people care about itThe psychopaths in this movie, unlike many horror-thrillers out there are by no means glamorized. If they were, then I could call this a sick movie but it is quite the opposite case. Very good acting. K. Reilly is a late discovery for me. Younger actors who played the psychopathic kids and the assimilated psycho kiddos in the making... all did a fascinating job... unless they didn't have to act.
Food for thought for those who think this is one mean, mindless torture porn: Would you call Lord of the Flies a despicable, dehumanizing book? or Ciudade de Deus such a movie?Also: what goes punished in the world and what doesn't?",Eden Lake
207,malthenielsen,A truly awful movie about idiots being killed by idiots.,2,5 July 2019,"So this movies tries to be a modern version of ""The Hills Have Eyes"" tyoe of movies. A happy family in the deep country, and then they get attacked by rednecks.The movie as such is badly made. The main characters are generic, shallow and completely uninteresting. The part in the beginning when they drive in the car to Eden Lake is needlessly long and uninteresting. The short stay at the motel in the beginning is probably meant to signal problems ahead, but it fails at that and is just boring. You just get irritated at the main characters for booking a motel they don't like, instead of just going straight to the lake. This is the first time when the movie uses the classical tehcnique of having one of the characters adress the unbelievability of a situation - the guy says the motel was nice the last time they were there.This technique was repeated endlessly every time the badly written script had the main characters do something stupid. Fassbender's character for no reason enters somebody's house, which is illegal and a bad thing to do. Afterwards his, very tolerant, girlfriend just mentions it.Later in he is trying to escape the teenagers, driving fast through a forest, without being able to see stuff like trees - and he just needs to drive slightly faster than running speed to get away from teenagers on foot. But because the script needs the car to crash, probably because it would be hard to create a believable scene with the teenagers and children overpowerings Fassbender, several of them do seem to be around 12, so there he is, driving full speed blindly for no reason, while complaining that he cant see.)Anyway, after a boring beginning the teenagers become hostile and the action starts. This whole part of the movie is an endless repeat of the pattern; teenagers attack, heroes escape, run for a bit, then the teenagers find them again inside the huge forest. It's just not big enough to escape, and those teenagers surely are some expert trackers! A full THREE times they repeat the exact same pattern of the girl hiding from the teenagers in a sneaky way (in the water under a shed on a lake, on the roof of another shed, inside a garbage bin.) The woman character seems to have a fondness of sheds, prioritizing to investigate sheds rather than just running away from her pursuers.At some point after her boyfriend is dead the script demands that she also should be injured, so they have her randomly step on a stick and hurt her foot. She limps for a bit, then her foot, that they spend a scene showing as destroyed seems fine again. This disappearance of injuries repeats a pattern from earlier, when her boyfriend had his tongue severely cut, helas he can talk fine again a few minutes later, and it is never mentioned again his tongue was mangled.Movies with the hero being chased and repeatedly found, so he can escape again etc, can be done very well, in various ways, for instance like in ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" or ""Predator"". There are 100s of movies with chases they could use as a model.Yet they produce this repetitive nonsense, with adults simply being unable to get away from some teenagers on drugs. Even when they've gotten far away from them she's bound to just pick the same tree to rest on that the teenagers decided to check out. The lazy script writer just relies on unexplained random coincidence during the entire movie.",Eden Lake
208,TheAgonyOfPlasma,Remember Mary Flora Bell?,9,6 November 2008,"She murdered two little boys in December 1968. Both victims - Martin Brown and Brian Howe - were strangled. Police reports concluded that Mary Bell had gone back after killing Brian to carve an ""M"" in his stomach with a razor, as well as use scissors to cut off bits of his hair and scrape part of his genitals. This sweet little girl had the words 'pure evil' written all over her pretty face. The same words, which connect to Brett and his fellow hoodies. 'Chav' is often used as a stereotype to refer to white, poorly educated, aggressive youths, but youth and aggression are not the defining attributes of a 'chav'. The term is similar to America's 'white trash' stereotype. A young pair of soon-to-be-married loving birds is terrorized, abused and tortured by a group of teenagers wielding knives. A bloody nightmare takes place in the woods near peaceful Eden Lake. A nightmare of cutting, hysterical fear and the stench of burning flesh. Just like in Spanish ""Who Can Kill a Child?"" (1976) the villains are just kids - kids from dysfunctional families with the senseless violence and vandalism on their minds. A moral bankruptcy of characters makes the crimes themselves as easily erasable as the videos depicting them. ""Eden Lake"" captures the true essence of abstract evil - it's savagely violent, disturbing and relentlessly tense assault on the viewer's mind. I see the growing amount of the children with emptiness inside everyday. The anger flows through their veins and is ready to explode in mind-shattering outburst of savage brutality. These children shed no tears - no tears for the crying victims, because they are victims themselves.I am still waiting for ""Let's Go Play at the Adams"" film adaptation.",Eden Lake
209,mikelepost,The implausible stupidity of the characters wrecked this film,3,8 May 2009,"Eden Lake is well-directed and acted, with some legitimately suspenseful moments and a few moments of cringe-worthy violence. Unfortunately, the main characters - the lead male in particular (we'll call him Steve, I think that was his name) - act in such a moronic way for no reason other than to keep the plot moving along that my suspension of disbelief was already at the breaking point ten minutes in. This pulled me way out of the story and really diminished the extremely effective second act of the film.For example: 1. Steve appears to have some money and social standing, based on his clothes and the car he drives. Why the hell would he take his girlfriend to a disused quarry at a construction site to propose? There's nothing special about the titular Eden Lake. It's just a lake.2. Why would Steve continue to stay at the lake after the kids refuse to turn down their stereo, one of them exposes himself to Steve's girlfriend, and they pop the tire on his jeep? Why would anyone stay there after it's become clear the place is dangerous? 3. Why would he follow these kids to their house and then let himself inside when they don't answer the door? Was he going to tell their parents on them? If so, why did he hide and then climb out the upstairs window when the dad came home? And then go back to the lake? I won't even get into the fact that the kids' pit bull manages to kill itself by leaping right on top of a pocket knife - riiiiiight.I'm sorry, but when 1-3 above happens within the first 15-20 minutes of a picture, I have to come to the conclusion that a) Steve is mentally retarded or b) this is a case of really slopping script writing. Since nothing else about Steve seemed ""special"" I'm guessing the answer is B.As for the ending ... meh. It was quite a coincidence that the girl ends up at the parents house. Quite a coincidence indeed.Overall it's just a sloppily written exploitation flick with a few tense moments and some extremely stupid people.",Eden Lake
210,smartbomb,Fantastic,8,22 March 2009,"Wow. This is a real horror classic. It's also a horror film that doesn't need supernatural monsters. Amoral behaviour and some bad luck provide plenty of terror.Great acting, direction and cinematography, and an unsettlingly believable plot make watching this a very tense experience. The excellent musical score works amazingly well to reflect and heighten the powerful emotions depicted - fear, rage, hope and hopelessness.If its technical achievements were all it had going for it, I would fully recommend it, but the movie has a brain as well and puts it over the top.Excellent film that transcends the genre. Not easy to watch, but very powerful.",Eden Lake

212,GodsPrototype,Welcome to England,8,6 April 2009,"Eden Lake is one of those films that harks back to an age of 70's movies with no light at the end of the tunnel. Films like 'Last House on the left' & 'I spit on your grave' seem to be have been an influence on this modern take of the extremities of living in 21st century England. This film has the capability to shock on so many levels and not just because of the levels of torture and blood.It is one of the few films I have ever seen that truly incites anger and hate in the viewer, not for the film itself, but for what is occurring in the film. If the film had been done as a serial killer or group of adults hunting the young couple in the woods then the film would have just been another average slasher thriller. But the fact that it is children and teenagers' perpetrating these horrific acts makes the film even more terrifying and somewhat powerful.As horror fans we have all seen torture scenes and either laughed or even revelled in the copious amounts of gore that is let loose but it is the realism in Eden Lake that takes you by the jugular and refuses to leave your mind for a few days afterwards. The plot is very believable and although we may not necessarily act in the way that the main male character acts, we all know someone who would act stupidly enough to warrant the attention from the teenagers.Jenny, in a brilliant performance by Kelly Reilly, becomes the hunted after witnessing the horrific torture of her boyfriend and we feel for her character for the dreadful situation she finds herself in making the ending ever more unsettling. The question remains that are some teenagers born inherently violent and sadistic or do they find themselves just caught up in the situation a little too much and it right to punish them for the crimes at such a young age by killing them also? The acting is great, the film is written well and looks brilliant and somehow reminded me of 'The Descent' another great horror film. (SPOILER) Now let's come to the much-debated part: the ending of the film that divides so many people It is dark, gloomy, shocking, saddening, almost heart breaking and deeply unsettling and it lingers with you for a while afterwards. Maybe Jenny could have done something differently but either way it leaves you with a sense of anger or helplessness that ends the film on a very doom-laden note, don't expect to be smiling.The way it should be viewed is that if a mad woman comes into your house covered in blood and she is accused of murdering the children of the adults in the house, mob culture will prevail. In the parents eyes the kids are angels and Jenny took their lives away no matter what happened to her. Sadly, like the psycho teenager; Brett, this film is a massive reflection of early 21st century society in England.Deeply unsettling & thoroughly provoking throughout this film is a must for horror fans & thriller fans alike just make sure you have a happy film to slip in the DVD player straight after. The ending will be much debated for a long time and my only hope is that someone makes a satisfying but intelligent sequel. 8/10",Eden Lake
213,charliejsch,Absolutely horrible,2,27 July 2012,"***SPOILER*** I had a feeling this would turn out to be a bit of a torture movie, and I was partially correct. The problem with Eden Lake is not the acting, not the actors, not atmosphere or any aesthetics. The problem was that I do not want to see a movie where the bad guy wins at the end and that could not even get to know or relate to the bad guy.I've seen many movies and anime where the bad guy wins but in those movies I can relate to the bad guy; you are enticed by their charm and/or relate to them in some way. In this movie you get to know the victims, and their choices are stupid to say the least; they muddle through this movie as you face-palm at their continual life threatening fumbles. If I wanted to see torment, suffering and death, all I need to do is look at a documentary or go to a third world country(then I can get a real 3d look, touch and smell at the people who are suffering). Eden Lake offers you a thrilling run for your life feeling and a hateful perspective of the young vile teenagers. However, these hateful feelings are not satisfied because in the end, the movie turns out to be depressing as the two main characters die horribly.I don't want to watch a movie just for the wow factor, I can eat a bowl of sh*te to get a wow factor as well. This movie is just that, there is not twist, there is not intricate plot and there is no closure at the end. This movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth; is this really supposed to be creative? Imagine I direct a movie where the Nazi's win the war and go on killing countless people, the end. Yes people die, yes people get killed - Go watch a documentary. Hopeless movie which just demoralises any positive view on human beings. Yes I want the bad guy to lose, yes I want the good guy to win. At least if the bad guy wins, let me like him or at least let me get to see their back story(relate)or have some creativity in the story!",Eden Lake
214,ub92,What was the point?,1,10 January 2019,"The movie is quite nonsensical. Doesn't make sense at all. No point to it. Some issues with the plot. When they crash the car, and Fassbender's character sends her to call for help why did she return empty handed? Why did she just watch? she had ample time to make it to a near town and make a phone call to the police. When she finally gets a chance to escape, instead of fleeing this small town area she crashes her car (a horror movie if someones not falling or crashing at the right time, can it really be horror), she immediately just stops. What happened, the car just broke down from that collision? lol. This movie just sucks.",Eden Lake
215,patsulli99,A couple decides to take a weekend trip up to Eden Lake where a group of kids turns their excursion into a nightmare beyond Elm Street.,8,7 July 2015,"This is one movie that, although I love it, I also realize that not everyone will. It's a simple and unoriginal story of a couple who goes away to the supposedly empty Eden Lake for a nice weekend of relaxation and erotic bedroom activities when a group of kids turn their excursion into a living Hell. Although unoriginal this movie stands out from all the others with this exact same plot line in that there are no super natural things, no superhuman people, and no BS. The story is gritty, down to earth, and at times downright hard to watch. The film makes you feel so many emotions including disgust, anger, hatred, and hope. I will admit that it starts slow but you do get well over an hour of gripping action, survival, and plain messed up stuff. It's a great horror movie that, although it doesn't really scare you, it's gripping, disturbing and everything else that a great horror movie should have. So in the end, this movie's one of my favorite horror movies and don't watch it if you are uncomfortable with blood.",Eden Lake

Do yourself a favor, pass on watching it. The entire premise, including the ending is far-fetched and implausible. The people who made this movie should be ashamed of themselves.I can think of maybe 2 or 3 movies that came close to being as bad as this. The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover is one. Arlington Road is another. Perhaps it's British culture, but I'd hate to thing as badly as this movie was written that it could be trusted to portray British people as anything close to realistic.

217,Anyoneatnowhere,"Grotesque, bleak thriller",7,20 January 2010,"This is a great ""revenge"" flick with a sick ending and plenty of gore. Definitely not for those with high-blood pressure or people who are easily frustrated.I felt like tearing my hair out after watching the last five minutes of this film. The director really toys with the emotions of revenge, sympathy and anger and the ending isn't wrapped up neatly and folded into the back of your mind. No, this movie may make you want to watch another revenge movie, but a less cultured one that will satisfy the base desire for revenge you will surely feel after it's over. The storyline is nothing special but it's the secondary characters that make this movie worth it - the locals with their uncouth children will scare you. A school teacher and her boyfriend drive out to the countryside to spend a weekend camping by a lake. They soon find out that the locals are a close-knit bunch and don't take to outsiders kindly. The worst of it comes from a group of teenagers who begin to bully the couple and appear to live by only one moral code: you take care of your own. After an accident leaves a pet dead, things quickly escalate and the young couple soon find themselves fighting for their lives as they discover that these kids will stop at nothing for revenge. What surprised me most about this movie was that it starts out by having the main character take the moral high ground but has her descend into a perverse sense of justice by the end. This isn't a preachy movie but there is definitely a good deal of social commentary on youth culture in the UK during the past few years. The ending has a dark sense of humour about it too and you'll probably be screaming as you punch walls in frustration at the conclusion.",Eden Lake

For some reason I thought it was about things that go bump in the night -- Little did I know.The movie itself was fair, the story-line was a bit weak beyond the fact that these things do happen. I would have given the movie a 5 rating, however, this movie is so disturbing just based on the ""copy cat"" factor alone that I gave it a 1 rating.

It's not about monsters and goblins, but what terror man brings to man, in this case teens bring to his fellow man. This movie is very similar to the real life ""Dnepropetrovsk Maniacs Murders"" in the Ukraine in which the teens film their misdeeds of brutality involving a screwdriver and other blunt instruments. As many as 21 people were murdered by the teens. Their cell phones and personal computers contained multiple video recordings of the murders taking place. One full video was leaked to the Internet, showing the murder of 48-year-old Sergei Yatzenko. He is seen laying on his back in a wooded area, and is struck repeatedly in the face with a hammer held inside a plastic bag. One of the attackers pokes out Yatzenko's eyes, and stabs him in the abdomen with a screwdriver. Yatzenko is then struck with the hammer in order to ensure that he is dead. All three teens were also found guilty on the animal cruelty charges. There was no specific motive behind the killings except that the teens thought might get rich recording ""snuff"" videos.

I re- watched it yesterday and really was reminded of how gruesome this film is.I think it was clever of James Watkins to write a horror film that did not possess any supernatural elements and it definitely lives up to a thriller status with its extremely intense chase scenes. You really do feel on the edge of your seat while watching Eden Lake and some scenes physically make you grit your teeth. I loved that this film was based around violent youths, as it really plays into the intimidation modern day people feel about teenagers, although people may argue that it reflects a negative image on young people and shows an unrealistic representation of them. To me, this is still an issue we face in real life and I think this adds to the terror you feel while watching this film. It was well made in terms of camera-work and editing and each scene was effective in creating tension and atmosphere. However, this film does have it criticisms with certain scenes and makes you want to scream at the TV sometimes.This is displayed most when Steve enters the house of the youths to find their parents. A rough child usually stems from a rough parent and you certainly wouldn't wander into someones house, especially with such hostile children inhabiting it. I found that really unrealistic. All in all, I have a positive review for Eden Lake, worth watching!",Eden Lake
226,todyun,"Notable, but flawed",6,22 November 2019,"This film delivers a solid emotional impact, as it deliberately plays with a wide range of sentiments. The beginning starts out incredibly sentimental to try to arouse as much sympathy as possible for the young couple who are the protagonists. This melodrama continues even after the horror part of the film begins, as the film really emphasizes the extent to which these two people love each other and the hope and promise they had before this incident. The movie is also shot very well, with a hyper realistic feel in the parts that are supposed to demonstrate innocence and a more gritty image in the parts that are supposed to be brutal. Unfortunately, what brings this movie down is its plot, which often has characters (both the protagonists and villains) making very unrealistic and unreasonable decisions. In general, the plot felt incredibly generic and felt like it was going through a prototype of these type of survival horror films. There are also many plot contrivances that occur (particularly towards the end) just solely to make the main characters suffer as much as possible, and I felt that the decision to include these contrivances did not add to a compelling narrative but instead felt like a simple manipulation of audience sympathy. Regardless of the mediocre plot, however, I overall enjoyed the movie, as I was impressed by its sense of bleakness and despair that so many horror movies today are lacking.",Eden Lake
227,Moviefreak4653,"Probably the best recent horror film I've seen, in quite some time!",8,31 January 2009,"I was just left in AW after I saw Eden Lake. It's such a smart horror/thriller. I mean here I was expecting a rather dumb and cliché'd horror film. However this film is just so much more than that, but it's really gripping, provocative, and extremely entertaining. Okay, well about the first 25 minutes of the film my thoughts we're getting hazy, like the film was feeling a bit rushed(still I liked that they just cut to the chase), and while its character structure in the beginning is really good, it still was starting to feel rather uninteresting at a few random parts. However when it gets more into the film, and more into the intense chase scenes it becomes more entertaining, and you get more into the film. In fact by the end of the film I was still on the edge of my seat. This film really is just such a greatly done horror film because it's very clever, and it's very indulging. Second the gore, is really professionally done, and while the violence itself is a bit over-the-top, it's done in a fun way. Eden Lake is just one of those films that is just so brilliantly done, and the movie is just so gripping, and just defines horror. It's one of those movies that is not afraid to tell it like it is. They don't care if it's out of your comfort zone, they're just showing you how shocking violence is being underrated. Plus I just love that this movie is one of those where you constantly as ""What would I do"", and that just makes the film more indulging, and scarier. At first I absolutely despised the ending, but know I love the ending to this film.The ending in my opinion is just so cool and so frightening, like this movie.

My brother happens to be the biggest fan of the ""torture porn"" genre in existence. As a lifelong horror fan, I agreed to watch it, and now I've just registered an account on IMDb to warn others how utterly cynical and cruel this movie is.I can't fault the acting or the production values, as these are all perfectly fine (and the only reason this film is getting three stars out of me), but the premise and message this movie portrays are borderline criminal. I'm not sure what type of jaded sociopath came up with the idea that an audience would want to watch a sweet and innocent preschool teacher and her boyfriend, who intends to propose to her on their trip to Eden Lake, be tortured and murdered violently by a group of ""troubled"" youths, but then I probably don't want to know.The moral of this movie is essentially this: You are good and kind, you're a lamb to the slaughter, you are sadistic and cruel, you'll get away with anything. So much so is this moral, in fact, that the only antagonists who receive any form of retaliatory justice are the ones who are uncomfortable with the events that occur. Essentially the ""good bad guys"". I needed to write this because this movie has physically just left me ill in that there are people out there who enjoy this rubbish. ""The Thing"" is a horror movie. Atmosphere, substance and depth make a horror movie. This move towards violent and sadistic torture and utterly depressing and bitter finales is disturbing. Don't make these movies a success. I don't want to see an Eden Lake 2.",Eden Lake
231,standeman1984,Effectively brutal chav horror,8,15 September 2008,"This is not a 'things that make you jump' horror film, despite an early red herring. It's more of a suspenseful and brutally violent horror that makes you squirm in your seat, taking advantage of the recent 'horror' stories of gangs, asbos and knife crime. We're all afraid a group of mean looking kids will randomly choose us to inflict their sadistic hatred on, though as this film acknowledges early on, as long as you keep to yourself, they might be annoying, but they won't hurt you. This is the clever aspect of this film, while it has the usual blood thirsty chases in the woods, there is an issue and a point this film is trying to address. Why are these kids like this? Are the parents to blame? Or any other adults? What role does the media play? The film makes many points and hints without ever singling out a definitive reason, until, perhaps the ending. What is clear though is the high number of innocent casualties, a clear indication from writer-director James Watkins of the real effects of this violent culture. It is often the unassuming bystander who falls victim to this sort of thing, as happens here, though also with varying degrees of guilt. Not since The Descent have i seen as effective a Brit-horror as this. Aptly, James Watkins is working on the sequel to that brilliant film, so i hold out hope it will be a worthwhile sequel. Eden Lake is by no means on a par with Descent, but is a worthy follower, and even makes a few nods in its direction - the disgusting bin scene anyone? There are problems such as how easily the violence escalates and the ease with which the kids are led and the lack of anything redeeming about them, save for Turgoose's character. This leads to some problems with the reading of the kids as victims themselves, but this is a minor fault. Kelly Reilly is great, as is Fassbinder. The gang are almost believable, but there are moments of misjudged acting - too snarly or not snarly enough, and they feel slightly clichéd and two dimensional at times - save for Turgoose. So yes it scared me, in a squirm in my seat kind of way but also felt like a well-plotted essay on youth-violence, especially with the chilling ending. Eden Lake - approach with caution!",Eden Lake
232,SeanBatemanJr,Modern Wes Craven style movie with all the problems,6,1 April 2013,"This film has style and content of 70s Wes Craven movies.And unfortunately for me it suffers from some of the problems of these movies. I wanted to like the movie, because I liked the concept. The idea of psycho kids having the most influence and parents basically closing their eyes or enabling the criminal behavior for different reasons is quite true.The actors, music, cinematography were also solid.But too much of the plot twists and the way they were executed I found unbelievable. It took me out of the movie time after time. You forgive it once, twice, but at some point you begin to see it won't stop.And this movie is not a meta construct like ""Funny Games"" or fantasy like ""Wrong Turn"", it is done in a realistic style so the unbelievable twists are even harder to explain away.A lot of moments could have been executed differently and made more believable. Some modern directors can sell the unbelievable moments, but in this one director wasn't always skilled at this. I actually liked the downer ending, although it also wasn't necessarily the most realistic, at least it was fresh and made an interesting larger statement. Those immoral kids don't grow up in saintly moralistic families and our society doesn't consist of selfless good samaritans or fair and objective parents.Overall I liked the intentions and not so much the execution. People who give it 1/10 probably have weak stomach, and people who give it 10s and say it's the most intense and powerful thing may not have seen some better crafted films in my opinion, like ""Wolf Creek"" or aforementioned ""Funny Games"" (which is an ultimate hard to watch downer movie).",Eden Lake

Watching this film is an experience more than words can describe, it plays on pure emotion.

The film is so incredibly acted, written, directed, shot, etc etc that it really makes you feel anxious, it makes you feel rage, sadness, disgust, all at the same time, and even though not even half the movie has gone by you hope and pray that the protagonists don't get found by the bad guys.

235,pixiesrule77,A Satirically Sharp Idea Badly Executed.,3,8 December 2008,"Savage social commentary gives way to cheap torture-porn thrills for what could have been an interesting premise, in this unconvincing horror flick. A middle-class couple go on holiday and fall foul of a group of teenage louts, a situation which quickly escalates into bloody violence.For all those Daily Mail readers who have crossed the street to avoid a gang of loitering hooded teenagers consider this film's underlying message as a vindication of your narrowed beliefs. Nearly all of the ""yoofs"" featured are unlikeable stereo-typical thugs (with violent, irresponsible, sex-mad, working-class parents natch) who graduate from shouting petty insults and spitting to fully-fledged torture and murder in a barely plausible heartbeat. The viewer is asked to believe that all six members of this chav-tastic gang (including a track-suited girl so steeped in stereo-type that she films all happy-slapping/slicing progress on her mobile phone) are happy to maim and kill a man simply on the orders of one boy (unconvincingly played as he is) and teenage peer pressure. Pointing to real life examples of this behaviour to argue your case would be fine but the narrative is so clumsily handled here, and the character-development so shabby, that the entire scenario just doesn't ring true. There are some plus points - the lead women does an admirable job in her role and is certainly put through the wringer. Caked in blood, dirt, grime, petrol (at one stage) and egesta she certainly puts up with a lot, going from sweet-natured primary school teacher to feral child-killer while still maintaining our sympathies (reminded me very much in parts of ""The Descent"" - a considerably more accomplished film), and there are certainly some genuinely squeamish moments during her ordeal. But sadly the film is too lazily and shallowly constructed to be anything more than a mish-mash of ideas, and any real social commentary is washed away in a tide of stereo-types, bad acting, and misrepresentation. It could have been so much more.",Eden Lake

While I thought I would be able to predict the script through the entire movie, I must say that by halfway through I didn't know where this was going and by the end of the movie I was a bit disturbed like I hadn't been in awhile from watching a movie. Filming, direction and most of the acting was very well done.

I mean, do; it's fantastically shot, smartly edited, horrifically well acted, and plotted and characterised with such a canny malevolence as feels that the writers just might hate you in particular.
It's an incredible film, in the way that Platoon was an incredible film.But there's just no winning, watching it. Either it'll crush your spirit just a little bit in the viewing, or else expose you as a latent psychopath (and I wish you the very best of luck with the fallout from that).
It is monolithic in its bleakness.
Eden Lake is not just a horror movie, it is a *horrific* movie. It is a *horrendous* movie. Heinous, even...but then we start wandering away from the root word (""horrere"" in the Latin, meaning to tremble or shudder, incidentally) we were playing on.
It's very, very, very well put-together, so if you're feeling a little masochistic and a lot stable, you could do far worse than choose this one for a movie night - best enjoyed in the company of people who maintain your faith in humanity.Not safe for children, the elderly, the misanthropic, the depressed or those of an anxious disposition. Safe for no-one, really.
It's not a ""safe"" film. Eden Lake is not a film about safety.It is a beautiful monster of a work, a nasty little underrated jewel of modern cinema, and I'm a touch jealous of the team who got to tuck this particular feather into their caps.
I don't expect I will ever watch it again, but I know I will be talking about it for a long, long time to come.

Otherwise, the film is basically a thriller in which you expect some sort of balance between fear and an interesting plot.Eden Lake is somewhere between the two genres, an ""horrific thriller"" to say so. It narrates the kind of really f*cked up story that you could hear at the news bulletin or read the Wikipedia page about with a face of disgust. You follow the poor victims with a genuine fear not only for them in the movie but for real life because the events could be described in some real issue of Forensic Files.It made me uneasy and I didn't like it.",Eden Lake
241,monkey_bean10,Different!,7,27 August 2015,"I used to love horror films but went off them rather quickly. I decided to watch Eden Lake purely because I am a massive fan of Michael Fassbender and was intrigued to see his take on the horror genre.At the beginning, I wasn't overly impressed. It started incredibly slowly and I thought it would be a chavs vs couple chase.How wrong I was. The capture and attack of Steve was shocking, engaging and utterly barbaric. The realism is what set it apart from other horrors. Also, how the gang change from being petulant nuisances to being downright sadistic and cruel is incredibly alarming. The gore is few and far between but when it appears it really is grim, even with some of the inflicted pain not being shown on screen you still get a real feel of how gruesome and painful it really is.The young cast are brilliant and really convincing - and a film with a young cast usually heightens my doubt that it'll be a good film. The biggest acting weakness for me came from the lead actress who played Jenny. Good for the most part, but utterly flat and dull when trying to convey her love for Steve.If you love horrors, I'd definitely give this a go but don't expect fireworks.",Eden Lake

If she would've just put the truck back in gear & gotten out of that Hell for a town, she would've possibly made out of there, went to the police, back where she lives & tell them everything, she would've lived. It was hard to see her die in the end because in these survival kinda films, you're rooting for the main character. I really wanted to punch the shite out of those people! I know they are just actors & this is just a movie which is not based on a true story but really in that moment, I wanted to punch the computer screen! There are a lot of things with 'Ifs' & 'Would Haves' in this movie which ran through my mind while watching & even after the movie was over & I was staring blankly at the end credits of the movie on the screen, taking in what had just happened & what I just saw! Unbelievable! actually not so! This could've happened to anyone, you just cannot tell these days, the growing pains make you bitter! The Morale of the story is that don't trust anyone with your life! unless it's someone you love & you know that someone loves you! Unfortunately in this movie her soon to be husband dies & her tired body & soul just wanted some stranger's help but little did she knew that these strangers would be her demise!

The only difference being that Eden Lake takes place in the countryside while the real violence in the UK takes place on our city streets.James Watkins has managed to create real tension, real suspense and some real terror in his directorial debut. So many UK horror films come with great expectations and so many fail, but with Eden Lake, Watkins has crafted a contemporary film that is instilled with the nastiness and vicious spirit of 70s/early 80s horror such as 'Last House on the Left'.Disturbing, challenging, thought provoking and downright electrifying in places, this is one of the best horror films of the past few years and one of the best British films this decade.",Eden Lake
248,flankkks,Don't be fooled by the high rating,2,25 June 2013,"This movie has a completely mindless and unbelievable script. The main characters do things that no person would do in real life, whether sane or insane. After Steve and his wife do so many things that are completely unbelievable during the first fifteen minutes, I was happy that they were terrorized by these kids. They had it coming for acting so unbelievable. The guy in the film is planning some romantic getaway for his girl. They drive awhile to get to some remote town and then some kids ride their bikes in from of his car and he gets a bit irritated. Shortly after that someone cuts him off getting to a parking spot and he is livid. This guy clearly has anger management issues. They finally get to a bar and the man gets upset because he feels the bartender ignores him when he tries to order a drink. Of course the bartender had his back to the guy and the guy didn't raise his voice for the bartender to hear him, he just whispered something about beer a few times. I guess he just kind of expects that the bartender will know that he's waiting there? Anyway, the poor baby has had a bad day. So to cap it off he takes his girl to some dumpy, mosquito infested lake surrounded by construction to propose to her (really!). Then, after some local kids show up playing music and partying (things you'd actually expect at a place like this), the guy decides it's time to take his shirt off and show them how manly he is. Maybe he thinks that will terrify them into going away? The kids and their music stay and their dog goes up to the couple and barks menacingly at the main character. She just lies their as the bark snarls and barks at her....really! Apparently she likes exposing her abdomen to an angry dog and human nature doesn't kick in to say ""hey girl, get the heck off your ass and tell this dog to go away, or at least tell the owners to control it"". No no no. They don't do anything rational like that. instead the guy goes over, acting like he owns the lake and tells them they should turn down their music and stop being a-holes. really! How does he expect this GANG OF DELINQUENTS to react to that kind of instigation? By saying ""yeah OK dude, we were wrong, this is your lake, have a good time and thanks for calling us a-holes"" Right... Anyway, if you're rooting for the ""bad guys"" to harass and terrorize this snotty couple, you'll like parts of this, but even then it's pretty annoying.",Eden Lake

I usually read IMDb reviews by users before I decide to hop on a 90 to 120 minute horror ride. I was halfway into Eden Lake before I read a few reviews. *SPOILERS* I started out being very aggravated by the boyfriend, Steve, not getting over his ego and as if NOT leaving after his first encounter with the disrespectful, rage-filled brats, but stopping by the house and going INTO it was out of line and unrealistic. I did feel emotion all through this and even after I read reviews, I stuck it out for the ending. My hopes were dashed not once but twice when Jenny had hope of escaping and getting SOME satisfaction or a dose of revenge. The ending was horrible and left me angry because she already went through too much. Since she clearly didn't have the weaponry or strength to confront the kids and overcome (after we saw the Beatdown Brett put on his remorseful friend), I was angry the film ended that way. It seems like they just did it to be different from the rest of the horror endings. I also hated the burning of the other kid when they burned Steve. I could overlook the other problems if the ending went differently. I do have to admit that the actor playing Brett was good because I hated him immediately and all the way through.",Eden Lake

I'm starting to wonder if someone is ever going to make a cat/mouse thriller film this year that actually portrays how an intelligent person would react in this situation. Right along with 'Ils' and 'The Strangers' I found myself screaming at my TV for the characters to act instinctively as an intelligent, self reliant person would in such a traumatic situation. Instead they're constantly throwing away weapons, running away when they should be reacting aggressively, watching the awful things happen instead of acting to prevent them etc.Seriously, if I am ever in a similar situation and I act as the main 'mouse' characters did......I deserve to die just like them.",Eden Lake

Fans of Thomas Turgoose (who gets a misleadingly prominent billing in the opening credits) should go and see 'Somers Town' again instead: he's very much a minor background figure here and has hardly anything to do. Everyone else should also steer well clear. I like harrowing shockers as much as the next gorehound - there's a niftily nasty little British movie at the moment called 'Mum & Dad' that shows how the genre can work - but pretty much everything about 'Eden Lake' stinks to high heaven (I'm tempted to say 'would you Adam and Eve it?')

That is the only good thing I will say about this waste of film.I found myself forcing myself to watch it to the end in the hopes that something good would triumph over evil. It never happened. The characters were what they were supposed to be and the bad guys made you hate them to the point where you will seethe with anger toward them.But the film went too far. It's as if the director relishes in homicidal fantasies. Forcing us to watch a child set on fire and burn to death was beyond overkill.

What kind of mind would write such a disgusting, sadistic tale? Who would finance this sick trash? Set somewhere in the English countryside where the bucolic scenery hides the most hideous kind of rotten youth (apparently, the bad apples don't fall far from the tree), a young couple plan an idyllic vacation hiking and camping under the stars. ""Stop, turn around"" warns the GPS. No such luck for this naive duo, or unfortunately, for the rest of us. Nothing but revolting events follow. If you enjoy watching a Neanderthal ringleader and what appears to be his sour-mouthed sister bully a group of other early teens and pre-teens into hunting, torturing, and then setting ablaze two adults, followed by doing the same to an innocent youngster, then go ahead and enjoy yourself.I assume it's the assorted parents and friends of the evil-doers seen cavorting under a giant LET'S PARTY back-yard blow up for the finale. Totally ridiculous, but hey, don't mess with trailer trash whose English is so cockneyfied after a while you don't even want to know what they're saying. Did anyone ever consider subtitles? That might have been a nice touch. Didn't notice any blacks in the tribal adults even though one of the more viciously evil of the gang was black. Guess the writer/director was aiming for diversity in selecting his band of toughs.Near the end, prior to the final murder, this time at the hands of the equally moronic parents of the above-mentioned bully, one holds a fleeting hope that good might ultimately triumph after all this gore has gone down. Guess not. This film is sick and depraved to the final fade out.Can only hope this tripe went straight to video and was a financial disaster. Sorry to say, I was suckered in on a premium channel.

Here we have another utterly depressing downbeat film with a horrible ending that'll get rave horror fan reviews for its grittiness.The movie is gritty alright and about as fun as a tooth ache. I'm sure this type of ending on this style of film was original and fresh about ten years ago but its not ten years.Horror decided to go back to its 70s roots and give films of utter despair. Movies that had no winners. Films where the good guy always dies and the film just wallows in its own muck.This type of depressing crap may be wonderful if you: a) Decide you're life as a goth or emo has way too much meaning so you need one more film to depress you even more b) You hate kids and want to give a reason to never ever have any c) You think films like Hostel and the Saw franchise are just to cheery for you and you want that extra reason to end it all I never thought I'd have to say this about horror. but this has gone on for too long and its stale and old.Damn those film makers for taking such good actors as these and putting them in tired old cliché situations like these.Don't like anyone in this film EVERY likable character is offed. its not a fun film. The message has been done before and better.I commend the actors for the work they did and I truly hope they all go on to much better things.This isn't the worse film I have seen not even close but it no longer belongs, this style of horror should be a dead genre.This could have been a great revenge flick but the director completely screws the audience of any sort of release. Its a complete build up with absolutely no where to go.Imagine if I spit on Your Grave had them rape her and then after she gets her back to her house they shot her in the head and credits rolled. Ya Thats the kind of inept film making you get with this one.I am utterly appalled that so many reviewers get taken in by the bleakness and automatically giving it a good review with actually thinking.This movie isn't any sort of revolution. Its the worse type of film making.

The couple picks up a small agitation with the teenagers and then all in fun tragedy strikes... Right there, this is the time when you are about to move to get something to eat... to stop and wait to see what happens next.. Trust me, you will stick to the couch as the story unfolds...Marvelous acting and storyline! Cheers!",Eden Lake
262,Asmith580,Rational thinking is tossed aside faster than the stars I was given to rate this movie.,1,30 January 2009,"..We are seeing a common theme amongst horror movies in the early 21st century. What do you get when everything has been done? You either get something really good that goes above and beyond or you get a pile of rubbish as the English would say. This movie unfortunately is just that, a stinking pile of rubbish. The days of the ignorant and helpless woman are at an end. Women are surpassing their former self's by leaps and bounds and the last thing we need is too see a stereotypical overly dependant women who cannot muster the strength or know how to do anything on her own, but unfortunately that's all the makers of Eden Lake give you. This movie has a couple of bright spots with decent cinematography and acting. You can also tell a majority of the budget went to cameras and equipment, which is always a nice break from the shaky first person view that a lot of horror movies have adopted post Blair Witch Project, but it still doesn't make up for a poorly thought out story line. Now I may be a bit bias, but I typically like to give human beings the benefit of the doubt in survival situations, but it seems the screen writers of this film disagree. Keeping in mind the films budget and location, I went into it with an open mind. I was, however, thoroughly disappointed with the sheer ignorance and stupidity of the main character. Combined with impossibly bad luck and the survival know how of a baby, this woman was unable to do the simplest of survival tasks and I was forced to sit and watch it all. When you make a slasher movie it would seem that you are ultimately pinning wits against wits, will against will, main character against killer. You want to draw the audience in and have them side with either the killer or the hero, and Eden Lake fell very short of this goal. I felt that I was supposed to be built up to side with the hero in the long and drawn out character development just to learn that she isn't smart enough to outwit a group of 15 year old kids. Combine this with every cliché thing you hate about a generic horror movie and terribly annoying English accents and the end result Eden Lake. True horror fans; do not be fooled by the good reviews of this movie. This movie is a terrible burden to watch and you will undoubtedly end up kicking yourself for wasting your time. The only thing Eden Lake will leave you with is a headache and a question. How can anyone be so stupid?",Eden Lake
263,Critter1223,I can't even describe in words how amazing this movie is.,10,5 April 2010,"This is probably my favorite movie...ever. It is suspenseful, gory, scary, brutal, and many other things. It is fairly fast paced, but unlike many horror movies this one gets us to know the characters, even the bad guys. You start off with two normal young adults, going on vacation. Through a series of events, they adults make the biggest mistake ever. Then the chase is on for the next hour. This movie made even me and my sister cry at one point. The ending to this movie might make you want to through the DVD and TV out the window, but it is worth it. It doesn't matter how many times you watch it, each time you will be screaming at the characters to ""MOVE!"" or ""HE'S RIGHT BEHIND YOU!"" with all the jumps and scares thrown in. I don't know how, but every time you watch this it feels like the first time. It is just amazing. BUY IT!",Eden Lake
264,natamity,Movie,8,10 August 2015,"Wow, how other reviewers hate for a movie's ending to not go as they would like or expect. All those 1 stars yet most of those people admit to watching the film all the way through to its ending. If it was so bad I doubt they would all sit through the film in its entirety. No, it's the unexpected ending they take issue with. Goes to show why most movies have happy, unsurprising endings - because the writers fear being treated with the same contempt that this one has had to endure. If you haven't seen the film yet then please disregard the negative reviews and give it a go. Come to your own conclusion. For me it is an emotional, gripping ride the whole way through and is one of the best thrillers out there.. 8/10.",Eden Lake
265,aaronkalvani,"Not a horror at all, simply a realistic drama",1,31 October 2009,"I was really looking forward to horror and was quite scared in anticipation. The real Eden Lake is 20 miles from me in a posh area of the country. When I saw the film and how the hoodies treated the two out of towners, I could only think how subdued it all was. If it was reality the couple would not have made the first night. I grew up in West Drayton, the true hoody capital of the world. And there is a small lake called ""Little Britain"", as its the same shape as the map of England, down a road called Packet Boat Lane...and if you read the local papers in West Drayton, hoodies where responsible for a lot worth deaths to young couples than that movie showed. I wish the director spoke to be first. Visit there now and see the amount of burnt out cars on the lake. Google it, if you think I am making it up. To me this film was not horror, simply drama or watching a lucky escape on the evening news!",Eden Lake
266,gologo112,An indescribable disappointment - this movie is full or irrational hate,1,12 November 2008,"I really regret having watched this movie. I understand this is just a debut, but still, it could have been so good! OK, the movie really gives an explosive burst of genuine horror and terror. But that's all. Honestly I don't understand the positive comments here - there is no moral in the whole story at all (the movie is a product of art and should leave some message to the viewers). OK, we all have heard stories of underage or adolescent killers. So what?We learn nothing about this phenomenon that is worth to be learned. The dark side of human nature is only slightly touched and this is worse than not exploring it at all because this is a rather rather rather (should I carry on?) delicate zone. To do this in the right way and with the desirable depth, one should be a good psychologist (the director is obviously not). The concept of the beast in man has been widely exploited and there are some very good movies about it but not this one. So if you are unable to do something, just don't do it. This movie just looked like a devilish reality show or a news report. OK, we have enough of this in our everyday real life, we want something original or some investigation why this does happen. The cut needed to reveal the reasons for human self-destruction is missing. What do we have here?1. The plot, although potentially quite promising is rather shallow and the kids' violence is not motivated and comes out of the blue (we all know or at least should know the difference between cursing kids, smoking and drinking and kids who kill people). There is no explanation for these teenagers' hate, nor it is shown how it has evolved. Some boys and a girl who listen to nice music, smoke and drink suddenly become visitors from hell. You gotta be kidding me. The big WHY is just missing in this movie.2. Every director as an artist (even of a horror movie) should love and respect his characters and the human beings in generally in the first place. Love and respect for man is missing here - the rather predictable end just proved it (I hoped though that the director had some piece of common sense left in his brain and we all could have been surprised). And what we need nowadays is really love (ok, it sounds like the 60's, but this is the sad truth). Instead, the movie fuels us with rage and hate. At the end you are turned into one of these kids- thirsty for blood and revenge. We want these children die. No, thanks, I have some other plans for tonight.3.Justice should be present in every movie (we don't have it always in life, but cinema is art and art is not real life). I see a rather provocative trend in many recently produced movies of saying good-bye to the ""happy ends"". I am OK with this, but the trouble with an ""unhappy end"" is that you must make it brilliantly, otherwise you throw the whole movie down the drain. So the good end is not necessarily a happy-end, but you should really have the talent to make it right.I am sorry but this movie insulted me as a human being. Мy personal advice to the director, probably he had an unhappy childhood: get yourself some pets and find another job!",Eden Lake
267,saadziakhan,What the hell was that?,1,19 August 2012,"OK where do I start?Firstly for those who haven't seen the title.This is the sickest film I have ever seen, not because there is blood and puke everywhere, but because it disproves the existence of GOD or nature or any supreme being who is watching over innocent humanity.It left me restless, sleepless and nauseous for a 03 days and I am still hungover. Two months have passed and finally I have been able to gather my thoughts to warn you people. Do not see this!About the movie ..Screenplay is awesome, acting is good, make-up excellent and great lighting. well you would be thinking what's not to like and here is what.. the movie goes on into torturing the helpless innocent to the point where you wished you were never born in this world. And there is no redemption, no justice, no salvation. The plot leads them from one trap into another till they are brutally tortured and murdered and the evil lives happily ever after.",Eden Lake
268,williamsij,Truly horrible - which is the point,8,17 June 2009,"This is a very disturbing film in the vein of 'Them' - with a young couple being terrorised by a gang of feral chav kids. It's uncomfortable viewing to say the least but its very believable. For those who don't think kids could be like this they only need to look in the papers for coverage of happy slapping violence, senseless knife murders and gangs of savage kids. Sure - it's very sensationalist but I can personally think of real life events that mirror a lot of the violence in this film. Regarding the ending - and without giving anything away - I did like its bleak tone but found this to be the only really unbelievable part. When you see the film you'll know what I mean by THERE'S NO WAY IN HELL THAT WITH ALL THE EVIDENCE THEY'D GET AWAY WITH IT. As for the rest of the film, however, if you don't believe kids could do that, just open your morning paper.",Eden Lake
269,Negara,Have your brain raped in 91 minutes,1,4 June 2015,"This movie sounded promising especially as we thought Miacheal Fassbender could hardly be found in a bad movie. Oh, we were wroooong! The big emphasis on the innocence of the character of Jenny and the kindergarten with all the sweet kids should have tipped us off, but oh no! we were keen to go on.The movie goes on for several scenes through the exact same routine of the movies of similar themes. Nothing happening on the first night, the couple underestimating the threats and taking every sign and red flag for granted etc. Still at this point that could be overlooked as this is the kind of movie you've picked to watch after all.However, very quickly the story takes a huge unreasonable turn and just keeps going downward in a path were nothing can be explained by any rules of reason whatsoever, to the point were you are enraged with being taken advantage of in this way and having your nerves wrecked for no reason.As luck would have it, things don't even pick up near the end and just when you think this movies has hurt your mind enough, you will be tossed into an unbelievavle blackhole of mental torture, and then some. I find it very hard to imagine what demographic exactly would enjoy this movie. The cast and crew maybe?!",Eden Lake
270,NewYorkRipper,Disturbing thematic material - This should be banned in the UK,7,28 October 2009,"Yes, this is 2008. But yes, you read correctly. This movie should be banned outright from distribution or viewing within the UK.While this of course a horror movie, it is difficult to imagine that there is anyone out there who will find the topics raised and the characters portrayed within this in any way tasteful.Don't get it wrong and go into this thinking it's an exploitation movie, it's definitely not - but it deals with subject matter such a knife crime and xenophobia, present and current in the UK today and for this reason is treading very dangerous ground in that it may actually influence young teenagers who are in the very position(s) featured in this movie.This can most definitely be considered the ""Clockwork Orange"" of today, which while said movie can be viewed as a period piece, is tame in comparison to Eden Lake; which is also a period piece but very relevant to now and thus extremely dangerous in the wrong hands.The ride is a brutal and relentless one which leaves you feeling the sheer terror if you were ever in the position which the characters in this movie find themselves. If you weren't afraid before you watched this, prepare to be before the journey even properly begins.The only reason I didn't turn this off after the first 15-20 minutes is because I wanted to be able to see for myself and justify clearly why this movie should be removed from distribution in the UK. Watch it yourself and I'm sure you'll agree.",Eden Lake
271,feofanova,A disturbing study in group psychology with a few ridiculous flaws,6,23 August 2009,"This film is just as much a believable depiction of how far human group pressure can push the individual members of a group against their actual will as it is a horror-thriller. Apart from Michael Fassbender, the cast is pure typecasting perfection. The kids and their parents are disturbingly convincing to me. And as is rarely the case of thriller movies, the ending is actually one of the best parts. But be warned, this is NOT the typical thriller/horror movie, even though it can be somewhat compared to films like ""Ils (Them)"", ""Wolf Creek"" and ""Descent"".However, I do have a few major objections against this movie: Why on earth did director Paul Watkins feel the need to add SO much random impulsive stupidity to the main characters? A good thriller doesn't need to do that at all. Steve might feel a small appetite for revenge against those horrible kids. But only a complete fool would ever barge right into their parents' home without any further cause. It gets even worse, when he singlehandedly enters the kids' evening campfire site and makes all sorts of unrealistic demands. The last completely ridiculous episode is when Jenny (our lady heroine aka. Kelly Reilly) decides to reveal herself by Bluetooth-connecting to her husband's mobile, when he's being tortured while tied to a tree. Only by pure accident and luck, Steve manages to escape while the gang is chasing Jenny. But the purpose of this ridiculous action cannot be explained. In general, being a school teacher by profession, you would also expect Jenny to insist much more strongly to stop her 'brave' husband's many daredevil actions. This is simply not credible.Such pointless thriller effects drags down the movie's overall score IMO. A 6/10 must be sufficient for a such a movie with its relatively uncomplicated storyline.",Eden Lake

273,twentyfour_fps,Utter rubbish....dehumanizing porn for sadists,1,9 February 2009,"I am compelled to WARN sane viewers that this film is a worthless piece of refuse. I am dumbfounded how any viewers could possibly enjoy this horrible film. Stylistically it was well executed....good pacing, lighting, camera work, musical score. The only thing missing is a story worth telling. And the story Eden Lake tells is one of complete hopelessness in the face of evil. This type of garbage appeals to the basest impulse in some people, who enjoy seeing human beings tortured to death. There is no redemption, no consequences for the evil acts. In the dismal, sadistic vision of the screenwriter of this film, mankind is basically evil at heart, and the good will be slaughtered like lambs. Compare Eden Lake to Lord of the Flies, another film dealing with evil adolescents. In Lord of the Flies, we are shown a balanced view of human nature, one providing a metaphor for the good and evil duality in all men. The majority of humans turn to charismatic leaders for guidance, and those unlucky enough to choose evil leaders ultimately pay a high price. Because humans are for the most part good, the evil doers in life can only persist for short periods before they are eradicated by the majority who want safety, security and stasis, rather than pain and anarchy. The evil kids in Eden Lake commit the most horrendous of brutal murders, and get away with it. The end. Sound like a film any normal person would find gratifying to watch? It is a symptom of a debased culture when its citizens find it enjoyable to watch innocent people tortured to death, with their murderers receiving no punishment for their crimes. It takes a sick mind to write this stuff, and a sick mind to find pleasure in the viewing.",Eden Lake

What makes Eden Lake so terrifying is the fact that you can switch on the news, and find stories similar to that of the film happening outside your door.It pulls and tugs on the strings attached to the fears of the viewers - especially those viewers residing within the UK! With Britain being named ""Murder capital of Europe"" it becomes a film that plays very true to British culture - becoming very realistic. As far as horror comes, I believe realism in horror is far scarier, and puts the viewer on edge. When you know it could happen, and it does happen, your mind goes into overdrive, and it blurs reality with your fears.When a film can evoke a substantial amount of emotions from the audience, and the leaves those emotions lingering in their minds for a substantial amount of time, you know it's served it's purpose. For me, and for the many others I've watched this film with, this is exactly what Eden Lake achieved!With powerful acting, exquisite directing, chilling cinematography and a very endearing and shocking storyline, it stands as one of the best films I've seen in general, not only within the horror genre!Don't just watch it, feel it, imagine it, and you'll experience what Eden Lake wants you to experience.

This movie is classified as a horror/thriller. That's said, it delivered in both those departments, & without reusing the same old venerable tropes modern horror movies do. If anything, this movie offers us a whole new kinda mental anguish those movies cannot by utilizing very simplistic devices. 100% Realistic ""could be anyone"" situation pitting two ""adults"" against a group teenage girls in its theme of the fear & brutality being bred from within. This wasn't just some movie about bullying gone wrong. For me, this was more a VERY HARSH & but honest cautionary tale of how wrong things can truly go just by simply choosing ONE wrong battle. There's a great utilization of the woods as backdrop, as we are engulfed in this couples initial paradise as it slowly descends into a full on it ordeal nightmarish ordeal as the movie comes full circle. Michael Fassbender of course is terrific & in typical fashion delivers brilliantly as someone we both will scream in frustration & compassion for. I'd say all actors By its end, This movie inspires alot of uncomfortable feels, as it's climax is easily one of the most mentally jarring turns of events I've seen for this kinda ""thriller"".

280,anspruchsvoiier,"Terrible, boring, unintelligent...in other words a waste of time",1,26 December 2008,"Good horror movies are hard to find and if you look here you won't find one. This flick is one of those that only work by making their main protagonists stupid beyond believe. You hate those movies where the victim opens the door with the murderer behind it, despite better knowledge? Then don't waste your time on this movie, because it is nothing more than 90 minutes of those moments strung together.The plot is quickly told: A young couple, which is camping at a beach in a forest, gets into trouble with a group of teenagers - or rather kids - after complaining to them about their loud music. Things get out of hand afterwards and they end up being hunted by the minors. Sounds stupid and unbelievable to you? Then you got it right.From the moment the movie tried to sell the small clash between the couple and the teenagers as a major reason to base the following 70 minutes of violence on, I knew this one would be really bad and I wasn't proved wrong.The story is so full of plot holes, that it is unbelievable that the movie even achieved a higher rating than 3.The next part is dedicated to the many plot holes and therefor will contain spoilers: When the couple first meet the kids at the beach, the man ends up being a total sissy, while the kids humiliate him. We are talking about 12-14 yr olds here, while the guy himself looked pretty muscular. Unbelievable.Later the kids steal their car. When the couple finds them, the guy still acts like a whiny idiot and begs for his car. The scene ends in a fight with one of the older kids, who draws a knife and attacks the man, who manages to get a hold of it and accidentally stabs the rottweiler of the kids. Instead of using the knife to his advantage, he drops it in a totally unbelievable fashion, apologizes for the dead dog and suddenly flees with his girl in his car.Which guy lets himself get humiliated by a bunch of kids? Who runs from kids, which he could have easily overpowered? Who drops his only weapon in a (make believe) situation of danger, but then runs from his ""foes"" to keep himself from harm, while the situation was in fact very controlled? When was the last time you saw a school teacher being beaten by a bunch of kids? The end of the movie follows the fashion of those that try to be different by doing the opposite of what you expect. You won't like it, so after you wasted your time watching a movie about a bunch of kids out of control, who chase two girls through the woods, you will wish to have watched something good instead - unless of course you like movies with unintelligent, illogical story lines.I sure know I don't.",Eden Lake

282,mikefoxx666,The ending RUINS what could have been a great movie!!!,1,23 May 2009,"I started off thinking this movie was good, great even, but the ending sucks more s**t than the ending of Funny Games (2007), if that's even possible!! so please don't be a fool and buy it, you will regret it.The writer/director of this crappy little movie (James Watkins) about a gang of teen thugs terrorising a young couple, clearly has NO IDEA at all about pleasing his audience and in fact leads the viewer to conclude that it is possible to get away with violent torture and murder with no punishment or consequence whatsoever.OK, so maybe he didn't want to turn his heroine into Ripley or Sarah Connor, but mate, your audience sure did, and consequently the lame and utterly disappointing ending completely spoilt what could have been a good movie and so served only to totally waste 90 minutes of my life. I expect Watkins thought he was being 'clever' or different with the hopeless conclusion to Eden Lake, but he was instead simply pi**ing all over his audiences expectations which is why I would never recommend this garbage to a soul and would never watch it again.It wouldn't need Einstein to tell Watkins that people like to see the bad guys get what they deserve, but this bloke obviously has no idea what audiences want so I would also steer well clear of any of his future efforts (but let's hope they are few if at all).And if you're thinking that Tom Ripley (The Talented Mr. Ripley) got away with murder and I didn't mind, well, me neither and that's because Tom Ripley, despite what he was, was a very likable character whereas none of the surviving scumbags in Eden Lake are.Avoid this movie like the plague unless you like being angry and hugely disappointed!!!!!",Eden Lake
283,zoegraham-85551,"When you take away ridiculous gore, torture chambers and monsters what you are left with is something like Eden Lake",8,8 September 2015,"I loved this film. I had no expectations going in and really that is the best way to watch it. The low budget feel gives it a realism that is so difficult to achieve especially in a genre as overdone and amped up as horror tends to be these days. When you take away ridiculous gore, torture chambers and monsters what you are left with is something like Eden Lake. The plot is simple, a couple go away for weekend break and are subsequently terrorised by local youths. Yes, that really is it. However this is better than say The Strangers or The Purge and other films of that ilk whereby an innocent family is terrorised by another group. In a way it is more akin to The Hills Have Eyes. What sells this film are the performances of the couple (Fassbender and Reilly), who I genuinely cared for, but also the antagonists, who are given names, faces and personalities. Thomas Turngoose as always is particularly great. They are not cold blooded random serial killers, but a group of teenagers who push each other to do worse and worse things to poor old Jenny and Steve. Now I have to say I was with this film to the end. But the ending of this film is one of the most infuriatingly either good or bad endings I have ever seen in a movie. ***SPOILERS**** So, after everything the couple have been put through throughout the film, Jenny ends up escaping back to the nearby town and finds a house of people to help her. Yay! Finally some pay off for the brutality we have witnessed, maybe she will get revenge? maybe she will at least get to go home? Nope, she gets killed by the father of one of the (now missing) teenagers, The End. This ending is either genius, subverting the audience's expectations completely and maybe saying, look the rest of this movie was realistic, in real life you don't get a happy ending. Or its completely stupid and just wanted to remove any pleasure for the audience at the end of a fairly harrowing plot. I am still not sure. Anyway this is still one of the better horror films I have seen in recent years particularly if you ignore the last ten minutes. Highly recommend watching it to any fans of the genre.",Eden Lake
284,Squees,A Stark extremity with horrifying plausibility.,8,14 September 2008,"Rarely does a film manage to anger me in such a myriad of ways as Eden Lake did.The film's premise is that of a couple spending a romantic weekend at a disused quarry before it is built over for apartments. Whilst enjoying the sites of the beautiful Eden Lake, they run into a gang of loutish youths. What begins as thuggish behaviour, slowly escalates into the couple being more and more pushed by the kids until the crescendo is reached and the couples car is stolen (by the kids, as seen in a later scene.) Our 'protagonist' asks for his keys back as the kids, amused, profess innocence. As the intensity increases, knifes are suddenly pulled out and during a struggle, the groups dog is killed. Thus starts an extreme, horrific, and infuriating ride that is Eden Lake.I said at the start that this film enraged me, and to begin with it was for all the wrong reasons. Yet again, I thought I was about to endure a stereotypical classification of young chavs as poor, stupid, and one track minded - thugs of society that have no respect for anything. And to begin with this is what we get, a classic case of the good vs evil, an innocent couple plagued by a younger generation with no morals.And then the film flips itself around with a monumental scene following the aftermath of the dogs death. Before, the group were all enraged by this act against them during the night, but then as the camera follows the girlfriend towards noise in the coming day, we see Steve tied up, beaten severely and bleeding profusely. The scene that follows is impeccably done, just enough realistic, cold barbarity with reason as the leader forces the doubters into cutting the man so that they are all 'in on it' - a horrifying extremity of the weapon that is peer pressure, all whilst being videoed by the girl of the group. It is here that the characters come to life, the ones that follow the larger, goaded in by acceptance into a group, ones that do not mind laughing when nothing is at stake but humiliation. However, once the reality of excessive force is shoved in their face, and the situation is starting to unfold into an all too real nightmare, their morality comes calling and the plead to take it no further, here we see the main thug (played very well by the young actor) for what he is, a 'headcase' as one of his friends puts it.Yet, this glimmer of rationality dissipates, and they fold to fear and act, cutting the innocent man that lies before them where the others have done so before them. Then starts the chase of the girlfriend. The cinematography is stunning, the level of grime upon the character of Jenny growing as the darkness of the film broods.Up until this point, we still had the good vs evil, the plagued woman trying to escape her brutal assailants, and this is where the genius of the film escalates with a simple yet harrowing scene. She breaks the glass of a nature reserve stand in order to retrieve a map, sees the glass and, after hesitating, rips some of her dress off to wrap around the slither of glass - a weapon has been made. On comes one of the younger boys that was so hesitant before. He approaches cautiously, and with the look in his eyes it is apparent he wishes her to escape so the nightmare can be over for him just as much her. She whips round and stabs him straight in the neck, a shocking scene as she has become the feral monsters she tried to escape from, eye for an eye, revenge being the only driving factor. Slowly it dawns on her what she done to the young boy and he slowly dies in her arms as she screams in horror of what she has become, what she feels she was pushed to do.THIS is where the real conflict and message of the films is placed for me. Do we act on revenge? Is an eye for an eye a motto to live by, and is that acceptable? She aimed for the neck, she aimed to kill, and in the aftermath, we find ourselves feeling sympathy for the dead child, an innocent victim of youth culture. Or is he? Along with another child that dies later on, are these children truly innocent? They did wish it to escalate yet they did nothing, they protested meekly but did not stand up as a group. Later, the girl who videoed everything runs away, she has had enough. Jenny sees her in the road, hit the accelerator and mows her down with no sympathy.This is a film that highlights and is commenting on the worrying state of today's troubled British youth, and how often it only takes one to start off a chain of events which escalates out of control. Yes, this situation is an extremity, but it is not too far-fetched, you only need to take a glance at the amount of youth stabbings in the last year to realise this.We only need to pick up a paper to hear about yet another stabbing or act of warrant destruction. This film gives depth to those characters and does not display them as simply mindless dregs. Yes it is extreme, but that is the point, to highlight a stark extremity with horrifying plausibility.Perhaps the film is so powerful because of its stark reality. There is no boogeyman, alien, or ghost here - these are children, children tainted by those with troubles (end of the film hints at why, brilliant) and it is in that horrific plausibility, that we find the truly gripping and infuriating anger at the injustice of it all.",Eden Lake

In the same year as Eden Lake was released, the cover story of the 26th March, European edition of TIME International was named 'Britons Mean Streets'!

Until today when someone mentioned it on a forum. This movie, like the first time, still made me physically cringe and uncomfortable and frustrated like a good horror/thriller movie should.

These scenes are so good nice photographs that you will at some point want to jump into the screen and help the actors.This film is an indication of how good direction and good acting can make a good job, although script is not original and theme is seen so many times, and that is why this movie stand out in a crowd of them.I recommend to watch, and fans of the genre should not miss this movie.",Eden Lake

290,mr-cooljoefeatncf,Had potential but disappointing (minor spoilers),4,26 June 2014,"I was angry watching this film because I really wanted to like it, but there were just these flaws that kept bringing it down and taking me out of it. This could have been a powerful and emotional film that left an impression, but you can only have so many ridiculous plot conveniences before your film isn't taken seriously anymore. It is about a couple who go on a date to a lake, only to be terrorized by a sadistic gang of teens. During the first half I had some minor problems, but it was shaping up to be an engaging thriller. The part where I really started to be taken out of it was after the male character escaped after being chained up, because nobody was watching him since they all went after the female character. You'd think somebody would stand guard, considering its a size able enough group and you don't need EVERYONE to go after this one woman. Who by the way got them to go after her by using the guys phone (which the teens had possession of)to call the police. Now how did she know that they wouldn't have just killed him right there, I don't know, seemed kind of risky. Anyway they could've had him escape even with one of the teens guarding him, just have the kid leave to take a crap and run. Or maybe have a more sympathetic kid free him (yes, some reluctantly follow the leader but are really okay kids) and struggle with hiding this from his group, and maybe have his group find out and kill him. This all would've made more sense then the generic plot convenience we got. One example of this. Anyway, its not as if there's no enjoyment to be had with this movie, but don't let the cliché plot twists/conveniences bother you too much, cause there are a lot of them. But dammit this film could've been really good if the two main characters were developed more and the plot wasn't so cliché. Also more focus on the kids would be nice. One of the positive things about this film is the sheer cruelty and relentlessness of it. It doesn't hold back and can get quite brutal at times. Also, aside from the cliché stuff thrown in, it is a pretty damn good survival movie. I like seeing action/thriller movies with vulnerable every man characters dealing with situations in clever ways, with awesome moments as well. Some of that is to be found in this movie, although it's a shame that so many unrealistic plot devices mess stuff up in what could have been a realistic and entertaining survival film. Recommended to people who don't think too much and are vulnerable to cliché suspense scenes and who can't predict plot twists well. Nice concept, but painful writing that tried too hard to be cliché, which again, is a shame because what happens to the characters in this movie is depressing and extremely cruel, the story is all around filled with negative emotion. And it would have worked if this crap tossed into the plot wasn't so dull and stupid. Your like, wow that scene was great, but then some cliché garbage happens that takes you out of the movie.",Eden Lake

292,alien-90,A disturbing surprise ! --contains spoiler !!--,7,21 November 2008,"Lord of the flies, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, maybe even Apocalypto must have been among James Watkins' inspirations while making this film.(It also has some similarities to the 2006 Irish film 'Wilderness') Eden Lake however feels much closer to home than the titles I just mentioned. I came out of this with the feeling that such an event could very well take place in today's society.A pretty impressive directorial debut from James Watkins, who came up with a simple storyline (A couple go on a holiday and get terrorized in the woods by a nasty gang of youths) and still really made it work out well. Eden Lake never looks or feels cheap. The film stays at pace and even the chilling ending, that turned for example 'funny games U.S.' into a total disaster seems to work well for Eden Lake.This is a well made straight forward thriller that serves up some real high tension.",Eden Lake
293,thetakeover83,Enjoyed it very much!,9,22 January 2009,"In this horror/thriller, elements of Descent and Lord of the Flies combine to make a GREAT flick.Basic plot outline: young, in love couple head out to Eden Lake to enjoy a weekend together. They have some disagreements with some local youths, and things quickly escalate. A LOT of gore and blood, as well as some confronting scenes ensue, not one for the faint hearted. Not a great ending I have to say, would have preferred something a bit more imaginative, but very much enjoyed getting there. Also, would have appreciated a bit more character development surrounding the main couple, and perhaps a few more people. Two couples going to the lake together perhaps? I also noted that the ""startling"" frights (e.g. young woman in clearing, looks around, hears rustling, guy suddenly bursts out) didn't really exist, and when they did, didn't really fulfill their purpose. I guess with so many horror films, that kind of little surprise fails to startle the avid viewer.I found it very interesting in this movie, that if you think about it, it seems a bit over the top. But then, somehow, you can see the logic behind the actions of the major characters. Or perhaps you need to have a twisted and morbid mind like me to appreciate this.Overall, 9/10. Watch this movie.",Eden Lake
294,ruudmoret-2,Sick,2,5 June 2015,"Sorry for this late reaction. I only watch bad movies on TV, and in my country this one was shown only now.Like all of you I was looking forward to a regular thriller, nothing special. I had read what it was about, but I never read IMDb reviews before I watch the movies discussed. Eden Lake started off well: a nice-looking couple going on a weekend trip and getting in trouble with a gang of young punks at the lakeside. The kids were too young and the guy, Steve, being an Englishman, had no gun. So no shootouts. Oh, well. But their confrontations really baffled me. The couple could have moved on to a quieter part of this wood. Etc. I'm not going to repeat your reviews. I only want to add a few observations of my own.To start with the end, it reminded me of The Blair Witch Project, a horror movie. But while Blair Witch made me gasp, or at least drop my jaw, Eden made me stare incredulously. Witches can be very wicked people, but Eden is a thriller, and realistic. I was stunned at the surprise ending: the ""heroine"" being murdered by the father of the main punk and his friends. That was that? You get such endings in short stories, not in 90-minute movies where you have been sympathizing with the protagonists all along (""daft"" though they may have behaved). I once saw such an ending in a Stephen King movie, where the protagonist shoots everyone of the nice people he has saved lest they fall in the hands of the evil aliens, only to be rescued by the US Army two minutes later. Why do directors do that? There's only one answer: they're sadists.Back to the middle of the movie. These horrid kids have really done it now. So what does the heroine do? She runs in circles, apparently, meeting up with them time and again. Sure, she kills one of them - by accident, as he turns out to be remorseful. And she runs over the girl - by design, but by then she is really getting mad. It's about time! The middle of the movie reminded me of a film starring Kim Basinger called While She Was Out. It got very bad reviews on IMDb, but I enjoyed it. (As I've said, I watch bad movies on TV, sometimes intentionally, too.) Kim was the female answer to Charles Bronson. Don't pick on details, just suspend disbelief and enjoy a lady killing her would-be murderers one by one. I thought Eden Lake would be pretty much the same. The guy shouldn't have been killed, only left very badly injured, and the girl - or, young woman - would have eliminated all these kids from hell one by one, or at least the psycho kid Brett. But no. As has been said, she never even holds on to a weapon she can attack those young punks with.Let's return to the end. The girl is picked up by, then steals the car of the psycho's elder brother, who's been looking for this younger sibling. I can live with that. Only, when she crashes the car, how could she possibly wind up at the house of these bastards? Weren't there any other houses around? Okay for coincidence, but this was over the top.The movie was well made, the actors were fine. Only the script stunk for miles. And like those of you who can think straight, Eden Lake left me feeling sick to my stomach. I love thrillers, but not when they show a total lack of morals. If in Psycho Tony Perkins had got away with it, I would have shrugged. But this psychotic little punk getting away with it left me utterly disgusted. We've had heroes, we've had anti-heroes. Now, it seems, we get stories in which evil prevails. Haw, haw, haw! Isn't that the way of the world? Maybe. But should it be celebrated in movies, too?",Eden Lake

It is mean spirited, cold, and above all else unbelievably frustrating and stupid at times. On the plus side the film is very well acted by all involved, and very well made. But such is the lack of logic in places and the complete lack of a satisfying pay off that any merits are quickly outweighed. For example: we have a lead character here that thinks its okay to wonder around other peoples homes without their consent. The other lead then does the most bizarre and random thing with a mobile phone that any suspension of disbelief is lost and the only appropriate response is 'doh'.And as for the ending! After so much horror and terrorisation I was expecting a decent pay off. But instead we get a downbeat, nihilistic sign off that has become popular in modern horror. I may be missing the point somewhat here, but all in all I just found the experience unpleasant. All I can really say is that this is a movie you should really see for yourself.

298,kitteh-76,Everything wrong with Eden Lake,1,12 May 2015,"I was warned by the bad reviews but wanted to see it for myself. And god, they weren't wrong. This movie is an insult to the horror genre, a terrible collection of cliché, horrific writing and storytelling. After reading some of the positive reviews I can't help but ask in utter disbelief: What is wrong with you people? I hate this movie so much! Why? Hear me out.Protagonist Steve is a yuppie-power-alpha-scuba-diving male adult, representing the educated classes, with diplomatic skills like a boot camp drill- Seargeant and the sense for keeping an even keel like dead wood.His girlfriend Jenny is the wet dream of every chauvinist - a soft, defensive, helpless and dependent female, with the looks of a doll and guess what: she is a kindergarten nurse, helps caring parents raise their children to mind - and helpful people. Yeah, man.1) Sophisticated Steve claims to know the countryside, but has no clue about the mentality of the people.Ignorant a**hole as he is, he bitches his way through the village, behaving rude and impulsive, making sure everybody gets he is the super-dude from the city. Super smart and super clever. Of course his she-doll let's him have his way.2) The lake seems to be very remote. The drive through the forest seems to take a while, and when their car is stolen, the couple walks back till dusk,so it is obviously a long way. I do believe that viciousness drives even lazy-ass hooligan-teens to do a journey just to harass someone. But a faraway place like this as a frequent hangout? Without bikes? In such a vast terrain? LOL, Never. 3) It is supposed to be a romantic weekend, but everything goes downhill radically due to his boneheaded stubbornness. As an adult and out of consideration for his girlfriend, he should have had the brains to get the f*** away from there. But no: Our narrow-minded alpha- male jeopardizes everything. His wounded ego cannot overcome the thought of being chased away by some kiddie-hoods, BECAUSE HE WAS THERE FIRST (that is what he says to the kids, seriously!).4) We, the viewers, would assume the kindergarten nurse knows how to deal with kids behaviour or at least knows SOMETHING about their behaviourism. Something that could ease the flames. No. After crashing into to tree, he instructs her to run for help, himself being trapped in the car. And what the heck?! Instead of getting her s**t together and run for their lives, SHE TAKES A NAP in the bushes and returns without ever trying to find help (Of course there is no need to hurry when your injured boyfriend is surrounded by bloodthirsty riots)!!!!!! WTF?!5) Beware of the working class, people. The adults are killers, their runts are killers, and they hate everyone who didn't emerge from their villages' swamp of evil. I could go on and on. Leaving the boyfriend with a deadly stab wound in plain sight, pathetically covering him with some leaves for hiding...15 minutes before the end I couldn't take it any more, fearing for my brain to damage beyond repair.There is NO character development, nothing that makes you feel for them. Only blind, cold anger over so much idiocy that I caught myself thinking they didn't deserve better. The black and white portrayal of upper class couple being killed by the scum of the earth is the cherry on the topping. And the worst thing is: the movie is so utterly without suspense and tension, cleaning your apartment offers more thrill than this. If you dig the ""harrassing people to the point of no return""- theme, or just enjoy a well crafted killing spree, I recommend ""high tension"", ""you're next"",""cape fear"",""in cold blood"", ""clockwork orange"",""the purge- anarchy"" or the mother of it all ""funny games"".",Eden Lake
299,amardikanto,My thirst quencher,9,20 September 2016,"I super like this movie! I never thought this movie could be THAT good. Apart from the ""end of chapter-like"" editing (fading to black and then move to another scene) that I don't really like, the movie quenches my thirst of light-gory movies, revenging characters, and stupid antagonist characters that doesn't realize that they're mean. Its a tragedy, for its sad ending. The plot gives several small climax and relieves as well - the moments you think the problem is solved but it actually not. The woman is surely a fighter, which gives me hope as the audience that all the evil actions are revenged. Some people might think the romance of the couple is too much, but since I focus myself on the action, that does not really bother me. Interesting enough that the movie still gives room for some human touch: the leading woman character realizes she makes mistakes after accidentally killing one of the boys (which I thought she really mean to kill him), and the parents being parents (in the diner and at the end), ""protecting"" their love ones. I also love the sickness of the characters: crazy and deranged kids. Even the seemingly nice ones. Too bad the whole fight starts only because a stupid mistake (I know this sometimes happens in movies I like, but for this one i think it's too much). But like the romance of the couple, it does not really bother me, since the action really entertains!",Eden Lake
300,MichaelRAllen,Taking Horror in Film to the Next Level,8,29 November 2008,"""Eden Lake,"" has received a limited release and it has sparked a great deal of talk amongst horror fans. The film has aroused feelings of fright, sadness, excitement, and anger in many film audiences, but the important theme of British thuggery has been dealt with in an exceptional way. ""Eden Lake,"" was created as a very unique piece of cinema art, and must be watched by those who are interested in, and can handle strong subject matter. Writer and director James Watkins has stepped way out of the typical Hollywood formula of; boy meets girl, boy loses girl, and boy gets girl back. Instead ""Eden Lake,"" delved into a new formula where a happy couple is terrorized, harassed, assaulted and then brutally tortured.This film's plot is very non-standard, with Jenny a nursery school teacher and her boyfriend Steve making their way to a remote camping spot. Unfortunately, there at the campsite this young couple bumps into a group of obnoxious kids who are hell bent on destroying their good time. As tempers flare and the vandalism escalates, an already tense situation develops into a fight for survival. It is not the intention of this review to give away major plot developments, but let it be known that this picture is gruesome throughout and ends on a terrifying note.The haunting musical score is the creation of master composer David Julyan and the music of the film adds to the overall tension of ""Eden Lake."" Julyan is also the musical director of other films including; ""The Descent,"" ""The Prestige,"" and a forthcoming feature ""The Descent: Part 2."" Much of Julyan's musical score is very eerie with few light notes, and the score acts as a subtle guide to heighten the film's intensity. The music is very reminiscent of the horror film ""The Descent."" One message that ""Eden Lake,"" effectively delivers to the audience is that if youth violence is not kept in check then it will develop into a national concern. This theme comes across early in the film; through a radio broadcast in the car, and throughout the film with many instances of violence involving juveniles. As well, in the final few scenes of ""Eden Lake,"" one of the main gang members breaks the fourth wall by peering into the camera. While smirking at the movie-watching audience it becomes clear who is the winner of this chilling film.If you can sit through some initial terrifying scenes then in the end your reward will be a very open ending, which will leave most people thinking about this film days later. Watch this film for its message and how it delivers it, and you will thank yourself for the experience that is ""Eden Lake.""",Eden Lake

A film finally that grabs a topical every day problem by the horns!....but then it leads it to Hollywood...It pretty shamelessly rides the new(?) wave of surviver based-on-true-story kind of let's- just- kill- someone- for- absolutely- no- reason- but- for- the- joy- of- it films that are fairly popular these day, God only knows why.Let's mention a few recent works here just to see what I'm talking about: The last house on the left, Them, Strangers, Vacancy, Hostel, etc.All of these have the similar plot which is that an innocent young couple are being hunted and tortured by a bunch of teens or unemployed/bored adults for practically no reason. After they kill a best friend or more likely a male partner, our heroine turns from hunted into the hunter and kills a few chaps with well chosen stomach turning methods to give us the illusion of vengeance and quite sadly makes us feel better to see a twelve-year-old bleeding to death or being impaled by agricultural tools 'because he deserved it!'This is still not enough for a bad film, but the whole story is usually just weak, have random happenings, lacks common sense and aims mainly the gore-hungry audience (who can't take their eyes off of a traffic accident because the sight of blood and flesh makes their day better).In this particular case: 1. What is she doing in the bushes from about midnight until dawn?! After a chase, a car accident and her partner's captivation she hides and the next picture is at daylight where she gets up from the same posture. Did she fall asleep?! I don't know about you but I find it insulting towards my intelligence.2. Did anyone count the days since the beginning which is Friday? Just because the end is roughly around Tuesday and the parents of the kids are having a foam party in the garden instead of starting to worry about their children and dog being missing for days at school time. Not one phone call to find out where the hell they could be, let's just have a party while they are not home instead! (Isn't this supposed to happen the other way around BTW?)I could go on and on and dissect the film but this isn't the point! The point is: These are just little things, you might say, but if it's a little thing then wouldn't it be worth paying attention to the details and make things right? Because these are the bits that are the difference between a good and a bad filmWell I'm not here to judge anyone but I think these films are directed/created by people who heard of Alfred Hitchcock and likes but unfortunately missed the point of thrillers very badly.They of course have their righteous place in the film world but this one could have finished a few places better.",Eden Lake

Young thugs who haven't even finished high school"" bullying a couple and then it ends with a more idiotic climax where the parents of Brett who is the ""bad boy"" of the gang ""finishing"" what their son started... Overall after seeing this movie, you will think of it as a horrible horror film, well that's how I felt it.....And just so you know I always give the ratings for movies more than 7 even if its not that good so yes of course this is the first sucking movie I have given one rating, Oh wait!

315,clarkstar,Disturbing look at youth violence,8,9 November 2008,"The worst thing about seeing this film is that you can easily imagine it happening. The way the scal/chav girl films the first attack on her mobile is just the typical youtube/happy slapping culture we see in Britain today. Every day we hear in the press about knife crime and youth violence, and though you might consider the film a bit over the top in places (and i hope it is!) there's an overtone of realism in it that gets under the skin.I would have lost the lead actor though and replaced him with a British actor. I guess this was done to make the film more marketable in America, but it would have worked better so much better with a British bloke as the lead male.",Eden Lake
316,xmeganx,Disturbingly brilliant,8,8 November 2008,"This film could easily have just been some chavs bullying people, but it is much more then that. I have watched many horror/thriller films and they have rarely effected me the way this film did. From the beginning the mood is set of this extremely happy couple living in their bliss and as most of you will know before watching this the film is not about their happy relationship. The first thirty minutes of the film are more easy going then the rest, but still captivating. As the film continues it shocks you beyond belief, I expected gore but I didn't expect how the tone of the film would make me feel.If you have an uneasy stomach or sometimes get emotional, prepare yourself for this film. It is gruesome but some scenes are a little too realistic which is what makes the film different. A lot of horror films similar to this lack realism so the audience cannot connect with the protagonist as easily, but Eden Lake has been made with a great deal of empathy for the couple and hate for the young kids. Seeing as there is a strong connection between audience and the characters there is a great deal of emotion involved which is unexpected, but this shows that the film has been made very well and that the actors do their job perfectly.The young actors who play the chavs are fantastic, and i'm not going to say fantastic 'for their age' because they are truly talented actors regardless of age. Jack O'Connell plays the ring leader of the group Brett, and he really shines. Playing a merciless hateful character is not the easiest thing to do, but if you didn't know better you would think that is how he is in real life because he is just that good. I have been a big fan of Thomas Turgoose since he was in This is England because he is also a very talented and realistic actor and he doesn't disappoint in this film either, but he isn't in it as much as I would like. The other actors in the group are equally as talented. As for the couple they were perfectly cast and they have great chemistry, I have been a fan of Michael Fassbender (who plays boyfriend Steve) for a while but I had never really noticed Kelly Reilly before (who plays girlfriend Jenny) but she plays the character very well and hits the right emotions at the perfect time.All in all the film draws you in, keeps you captivated, shocks you with the gore and blows you away with emotion. The best thing about it and what makes the movie special and better then most other similar films is just how real it is. You almost feel like this is happening to you, and their reactions are also real human reactions too. The film is truly great and one of the best of its genre, very impressive all around.",Eden Lake

I had read critical reviews and thought this must be an enjoyable story. I was sorely disappointed. The movie began with much hope of being a good tense thrill ride. The main actors performed the script, what they were given, beautifully. You quickly bond with the couple and hope the author wrote some redemption for their struggles they face at the hands of the angry youth. As the movie wore on, I quickly got irritated with the plot and began to hope for a quick ending. The story slowly builds but never achieves climax. It simply unravels at the end and a completely implausible finale left me angry for wasting the past hour and a half. A violent tale that doesn't seem to go anywhere and leaves the audience in the dark. This is merely my opinion but as an avid watcher of thrillers and suspense films, I felt this film was lacking a worthwhile plot and resolution of the story which held so much promise in the start of the film.",Eden Lake

A very classy 'terror' film.",9,26 September 2008,"I'm a huge horror/thriller movie fan but I've been waiting for a film of this calibre for a very long while. For almost the first time in my film-watching history, I was literally on the edge of my seat for almost the whole thing.The great, and worrying, thing about this exploration of 'chav' intimidation is that it requires very little suspension of disbelief; the actors portraying the perpetrators could be any number of the disillusioned youths we see on our streets in Britan every day. The bikes, the vicious dog, the loud music played, more often than not to exert their authority as thugs.What usually disappoints me in thriller or, particularly horror films, is that the plot frequently descends into a farce, or incorporates some sort of supernatural terror - making it much more difficult to identify with.

326,Lily_Park,Brutal but illogical,6,14 December 2008,"Even though on paper this film has all the elements of brutal horror found in The Strangers or Funny Games, there are problems with the script that left me unable to care about the fate of the characters. Basic things like returning to the scene where you've been terrorized to continue your holiday seemed so stupid that you quickly realize you're going to be served up a straight, brutal tale of victims and attackers. When you no longer believe in or care about the characters, a film loses its tension even when the characters are going through a hellish experience. A better script and this film could have held a lot more tension. Michael Fassbender is a great actor and all the other elements were present for a film that was right up my street, alongside Funny Games, Ils, The Strangers... but it was the illogical decisions combined with unrelenting brutality which made me lose interest here.",Eden Lake

This movie is one of the more suspenseful films I've seen in a long time and I find it hard to believe anyone could watch it without feeling sad for certain characters and angry at others. There is not too much gore or blood, but it is present and fits perfectly with the story, rather than seeming thrown in to make up for any shortcomings in other areas. I found every actor believable and for a movie with a 6.9 (the current IMDb rating) I would have expected less. This movie deserves at least an 8 and I am surprised at the rating it has.

Fine performances, and just the very thought of being disrespected and having your holiday ruined by punks sent my blood pressure soaring from the start. While some argue the ending wasn't satisfying, I much appreciated how the Director chose to honor what most likely would have been the outcome rather than trying to put some silly Hollywood ending to what is otherwise a brutal and realistic horror movie.Now, if you really liked this movie, I would suggest the following.

The characters are fantastic and the cast is very well chosen! The plot is excellent and although some scenes are quite bloody, it isn't extremely strong on the gore! When I was watching this film, I was constantly on the edge of my seat. The film starts off well and gets straight into the action without any dull moments. This film also ends extremely well, which I personally feel is the best part of the film as it is thrilling and not expected. I would most definitely recommend this thrilling horror flick to everyone, even if you are not a big fan of the horror genre because it is not very very scary but I would say it's more thrilling and suspenseful! Go and see this film!",Eden Lake
330,horse2005,Distrubingly untasteful,5,17 June 2009,"There aren't many suspense or horror movies of our days that show trough their art learnful morals or at least something to think on that is positive or new. This movie, although it is nicely casted and realistic enough (if we only look at the acting and make-up, tension, suspense etc...) is really only making us learn what we already know : that humanity is a disgustingly cruel and a merciless race towards itself, that some parents should not be allowed to breed, and also that even though there is law and order in this world, it is utterly useless most of the time. Of course it is an interesting movie to look at if you are bored and want to get emotional. But if we compare it to the countless other movies where nice little perfect/model-like looking couples go out in the wood and get butchered to death after running for escape during a good hour, this one clearly does not offer a new perspective on the thing. The only difference i could notice is that this time the kids do the dirty work instead of their own crazy parents. I didn't see no point whatsoever to grasp of this movie but sadness, sorrow and anger, extreme anger from my part i should say. It is the story as i said before of a couple going on their honeymoons in a little nowhere town in the woods (strangely enough since they are on their honeymoon, i mean.... what kind of place is that for a honeymoon) going on the border of a dirty and small beach near the town. They then meet some harassing chavs, which they don't get along with at all, that seems stupid but i wouldn't say mentally unbalanced, just plain stupid and unrespectful. The morning after they go back to the beach after their last bad day (i mean come on, that beach is crap, just get out!) they go out to take a dip, and when they come back their van is gone :O. Several ''trough-the-woods'' angles camera views actually gave a feeling this was gonna happen. Nevertheless the chase trough the woods when the couple are on their way back starts and you know the rest. Of course during the whole movie, people find each other incredibly easely. The couple finds the punks after walking for hours in the huge forest (what the chances are of that happening, i mean come on). Then the gangsters heads straigth to where the couple goes even though its absolute dark. Luckily enough after having their dog killed , they decided to give the keys to the couple but then strangely enough , they want to kill them! ouhhh. The couple crash with the car (like if we didn't knew) and while the husband is stuck (always someone getting stuck somewhere) the wife goes to hide and strangely enough doesn't get discovered even though for the rest of the film she gets discovered no matter where she goes as if she had a tracker or something on her. Or maybe the chavs got superpowers who knows. Anyways, the rest of the movie kinda go in that way but i don't wanna give too much if you haven't seen it yet.Trough the film the audience is irreversibly drawn to hate the chavs and be hopeful for the woman as she wanders aimlessly in the deep forest. And i will not tell you the stupid end.Although nicely acted and offers good suspense. This movie is absolutely non-believable and unreal. I know these kids knows the woods, but come on. They start as punks and then the leader turns out to be a crazy psychopath who burns to death a child for absolutely no reason.In overall i don't think this movie was necessary to humankind if only to show that it craving to pay movie to see its own kind getting butchered in movies that they would call interesting. Please, i mean, stop making disgusting movies, what has the humankind gone to. Making movies only for the sake of seeing people die in the most realistic way possible.",Eden Lake

I learned one thing 'never judge a movie by its trailer' i was so wrong this movie made me : ANGRY(A lot)+terrified-horrified. This movie is disturbing really disturbing. Kelly Reilly became one of my favorite actresses after i saw this movie. And another thing i learned if you feel really angry at someone in the movie its because they really had great acting skills the point where you want to scream and cuss at them.The gang were also good if i meet them in real life i would beat the s hit out of them. Where are your parents? Who the f do you think you are? I am really now as your reading and while I'm writing ANGRY! just thinking about this film.The ending....you would really s h i t your pants the ending was so good i was like 'you stupid b it c h' the ending left me with mixed up emotions and feelings i was like 'hell no' i don't know how to explain the ending.

333,james-xd,A well made horror with some flaws,7,18 June 2015,"I have kept spoilers to a minimum...The first thing I would like to point out is that this film is not 'the most disturbing film ever', as some other reviews would have you believe, and it is certainly not extreme in comparison with many other horrors. This film is simply disturbing, because it makes relatively little in terms of thrill, gore and horror, go a long way. This film depicts a scenario in which a couple camp at a lake, and refuse to be bullied by a bunch of youths. Some other reviews have criticized the scenario as unimaginative or not different enough, and yes most of the story is not something that we haven't heard in the news. However, the film does put characters behind the story - we sympathize with the main character's conflict between simply wanting to enjoy his weekend, against a desire to prevent the youths from winning, and the results of his decisions therefore affect the viewer deeply.We can also relate to the gang - their portrayal makes the viewer wonder how many seemingly normal people could behave similarly in the same circumstances.Some have commented that the film is predictable - perhaps sometimes, but not altogether. There is plenty of uncertainty to keep you watching.There are some big flaws - sometimes the characters do not behave in a manner believable to the viewer, and almost always their odd behaviours serve to intensify the plot. The plot also relies on a lot of convenient/unfortunate coincidences - whilst we can expect a film such as this not to have a happy ending, the number of coincidences leading to the end make it questionable (especially as the film is attempting so hard to be realistic).Overall, this film trumps a lot of others n its genres, and therefore is worth watching.",Eden Lake

Don't get me wrong as I don't live in the country so maybe I'm just being deluded here but I have never seen hoodies with London accents in little quite towns cutting people up because there bored, have you? Using a dead dog as justification for the main thug to go on a crazed, glue-sniffing rampage is just very weak writing. Yes I get their board and have sweet f all to do but the cheap gimmicks of adding hoodies, filming violence on camera phones, drug taking and knife crime that have been recent headlines over the last five years is just so old and tired now! Kidulthood and Adulthood pulled these kinds of tabloid issues off well; this film just tries to copy those same themes badly. Just plain lazy writing. Sorry have some imagination! If you know what's good for you take a miss on this one, it's a shocker.

I'm not going to tell you what happened because that would make me a spoiler, but let's just say you will likely be disappointed. The acting was excellent, especially by the main actor (the husband).

337,lsouseisekil,Unsavory,1,19 April 2012,"Eden Lake masquerades as a touching and dark film BUT it is quite the opposite. I, like another reviewer, had to register just to express my deep disappointment in this film. Sure, it starts off with a normal setting which you, as someone who is most likely used to the typical spiral into chaos, would expect. This however, turns into complete ridiculousness. The acting was such that, one feels that the characters themselves had NO faults and that it was Mr. Watkins who cruelly killed off such well-to-do people. Several things about this movie disturbed me:1) Upon having his tire ruined, Steve should have immediately packed up their belongs and leave the Chav-nest. 2) Why did Steve fail to arm himself while trapped in the car OR as he presumably escaped from said vehicle? Not only does Steve fail to arm himself but Jenny does as well. The chavs had no problem toting around branches whereas Jenny abandoned every weapon she obtained. 3) Steve fails to put up much of a fight and is felled with relative ease. He managed to break free AFTER being stabbed virtually to death? Mr. Watkins, I call shenanigans!! 4)Jenny FAILS to get help when prompted to initially. She then calls for help via Steve's stolen phone. This is a major plot-hole as only a true buffoon would make such a bad judgment. 5) The ending especially leaves a sour taste in ones mouth as Jenny coincidentally winds up at the chav-den. This completely made me want to flip my table. Too much of a coincidence resulting in the film being very upsetting.",Eden Lake

I don't think the film is ""predictable"" because I honestly thought it was going to go a different way to what it actually did. I would definitely recommend giving this a watch, but it is a heavy film and really relies on you having no distractions when watching so you can really connect with the characters.

339,tim-647-757197,"thrilling, stirring, radical and...an experience!",7,15 April 2013,"Eden Lake is James Watkins' first attempt as a director and a convincing one, I have to admit! A married couple, played by Michael Fassbender (Steve) and Kelly Reilly (Jenny), want to pass a romantic leave together, enjoying the beautiful landscape, go swimming in a nearby lake and forget about all the sorrows! This works out just fine, until a group of teenagers decides to disrupt the occurred happiness. One things leads to another and Steve is oblivious to the fact that he is unwillingly picking a fight with adolescents!It is the close to reality beginning that is still sticking in my head, even weeks after watching it! James Watkins is able to provoke rare emotions here! Constantly, one asks himself, how you would react in such a situation, respectively, it reminds you on own experiences when you are walking through your own city at nights sometimes. Teenagers who are brave enough in a group to insult and terrorize foreigners!After that first half, the movie turns into more of a ""classic"" horror movie with shocking moments, unfortunately. But it keeps being interesting since the delinquents are still teenagers! The survival- horror of the wife is not boring, however it is nothing special as well. It reminds me of ""The Descent"" a lot, in fact there are a lot of parallels between those two movies!The actors are all doing a good job in delivering their characters and the whole situation they are in very credible! Concerning the fact that it is a horror movie, you cannot complain about the acting here, even the teenagers, especially Jack O'Connell as their boss, are fitting in perfectly!Personally, I think that this movie is worth watching if you are interested in that topic. My girlfriend and I, had actually problems to watch the said first half without raging about the behavior of the adolescents. Furthermore, I kept asking myself how I would have reacted as Steve. Would I let them ruin my leave? Or would I start a fight as well? This antagonism of two solutions that are obviously not satisfying drove me crazy! As a result, I was blasé about the ""real shocker"" in the second half!All in all, it is a movie that really grabs you, however you do not want to watch it again, since it leaves you with a bad mood!",Eden Lake

This movie do not feel like a horror movie and is not your typical horror movie because there is no masked killer or college kids or intruder or supernatural ghost or monster or terrorist or zombie or mutant or cereal killer or vigilante or socialist or anything like that. this movie is about Fassenbender getting territorial with chavs which is big mistake because if you have went to England there are many chavs there and you do not mess with the chavs is big mistake. So Fassenbender learn to late because he realise chavs are not good news. so thats how movie end. it was very very well made, very believable maybe the most believable horror i ever see with very greatness performances. I like Fassenbender but i like his blonde girlfriend more because she very pretty and i feel more sorry for her. this was more disturbing than A Serbian Film this movie, and was very depressing when you finish it you will be very angry after and you will feel like chavs are bad people. overall I hate this movie but was very good. but I hate it.",Eden Lake

You are literally PO'd the entire movie only to have an extremely generic and pointless ending. I would love to have the last two hours of my life back!! I was really surprised to see all the higher reviews on here. To each their own I suppose! The male lead is actually very talented and the children who acted in the movie did a very convincing job as well. The downfall of this film is certainly not poor acting skills but the storyline itself. However, if you are into films that are very violent and chaotic this may be the movie for you. This movie almost reminded me of Children of the Corn... But not near as good!!",Eden Lake
343,helenthearab,This is Entertainment??,1,21 July 2013,The storyline looked quite good when I read the reviews and I was looking forward to watching it but you really do have to suspend belief in the early parts of the film (the bit where he sees the bikes outside the house and goes inside - yeah as if you would just wander into a stranger's house! He was just asking for trouble there!) I got as far as the bit where the young blonde boy rips the guy's tongue out with his knife (or at least I THINK he did - my eyes were half covered at the time by my hands!) before I switched off in disgust. I do like a good psychological thriller and a good horror however this was neither of these things - it was disgusting and made me feel physically sick. Not my idea of entertainment.,Eden Lake

345,spelledarn,Pathetic,1,14 March 2009,"This movie is porn for sadists.A couple, Jenny and Steve, is tortured and chased by sadistic kids after trying to spend their vacation relaxing in the woods. The characters are cardboard cut-outs, there's no logic or reason behind the sadism, and the dialogue is painful to listen to. In fact, the movie is a poster child for Plot By Stupidity, with no desire to actually leave or call the police, and no risk for the bad guys of being caught by national authorities.The film is low-budget, and it really shows in all the production values. Lackluster acting is coupled with poor music and sound effects, and made all the worse by a director more interested in getting people to scream as loudly as possible than to get any suspense going.Eden Lake isn't entertainment, just something to get future serial killers all hot and bothered. It's in the same league as crap such as Wolf Creek and The Last House on the Left, something for lonely guys who like to see women suffer.",Eden Lake
346,chaplinpadua,Ridiculuous Divisive Nonsense.,1,24 September 2008,"Truly awful, implausible from every conceivable plot angle or character motivation, this piece of pretentious trash also has the nerve to come across like a 'comment on society'. What it really does is to demonise, and deepen the perceived rift between 'us decent folk' and the imagined threat of the so-called 'underclass', especially their out of control children. I'm not denying that some children are out of control, but they're not all killers; and this tawdry film cashes in on a media-warped perception of parts of British society, and thereby reinforces it.As a Horror film it fails on every level. Dumb, misconceived scenes are punctuated by sloppily predictable 'twists'. The teenage gang are all cardboard cut-outs or lazy caricatures, as are the young couple, with whom I suppose the audience is meant to empathise. Of course, the whole thing is basically a 'Deliverance' rip-off, but it also pilfers a couple of riffs from 'The Descent', (by no means a great film, but compared to this it's 'Citizen Kane').

I also enjoyed the ending, as it was not too typical, and did leave me thinking a bit more about the morals and motives of the youths and their families.The acting by all concerned was good, although I hope they leave the movie 'as is', and do not attempt a follow-up, as I don't think there would be much more that could be added.",Eden Lake

If you're familiar with (as a couple of raters put it) ""yob"" or Chav sub-culture, you'd be nodding your head throughout and cringing in disgust at the antics of the wretched kids on screen. Another rater indicated that the kids hadn't been exposed to violence earlier, and I've a feeling that particular rater didn't watch the whole film. The blue- collar father of the leader of the bullies was just as abusive and, as it turns out in the end, just as vicious (the ending was absolutely chilling to me).

There were just too many plot holes in this movie, much of it didn't make sense.The antagonists, being small children with bad attitudes, weren't threatening in any way, especially with their little knife. Yet the adult couple were terrified of those few kids. And in the end, with the adult antagonists, it's even worse. We're supposed to believe a group of adults would lynch a woman for allegedly killing their child, without asking any questions or finding any proof and without even looking for the body of the kid first or hoping he is still alive and may be in need of medical attention? It's a movie that tells us killing is bad, but in the end, glorifies the killing and killers for the sole purpose of emotion. The film makers want you to be mad that the bad guys win, but I couldn't help but be mad at the terrible movie I've just watched.The tells of a good movie is to make the viewer feel what the protagonist feels.

Many movies have made me feel good afterwards. you know, stuff like The Notebook, or Notting Hill. Very pleasant movies and because of that very easy to mark down as great movies. This movie, however, did the exact opposite. I was actually angry after the movie. Shaken up even, really mad and had to smoke a few cigarettes vigorously to calm down. Even though it wasn't a pleasant experience I'm happy I watched it. And I have to give this movie a very high rating simply because it managed to do what no other horror/thriller movie has even managed to do to me.It would be easy to tell people not to watch this movie and simply say I hate it. But I don't hate it. It would be really unfair for this masterpiece to go down as a movie people hate simply because it manages to make people feel strong emotions. I hope people are objective about this, and manage to see through the emotions this movies makes them feel. That is what movies try to do, isn't it? I'm glad there are people who make these movies. We have plenty of feel-good stuff out there, but very little from the other spectrum of emotions.I would recommend this movie to anyone, but with a warning. You will feel hatred and anger. You will feel sick at times, and after the credits start rolling you might hate this movie and hope you never watched it. But look back at your emotions once you've calmed down and you might just end up appreciating this movie. I know I did.

It actually delivered what was promised since it's incredibly disturbing; but for other reasons than its claimed ""critique against society"", *Spoiler* An impressive start where a couple on their holiday clashes together with a group of young, sadistic, teenagers; so far so good. *Spoiler* The downfall begins when protagonist Steve decides to follow the kids around after a tire of their car had been punctured by an empty bottle: better to leave it be. Then the couple decides to camp on the beach where they had just been harassed: better to leave it be. And finally when they got their car stolen: better to leave it be and just try hard to contact the police.*Spoiler* Steve is a charming character, but he's stuck in the middle between being nice and stubborn. If you're a passive persona then it might just be better to sit this one out and have the authorities sort it out rather than persisting on attempting to regain ones honour in front of ones girlfriend.*Spoiler* I like Jenny and she inevitably is the character the audience should fall for. She seems to be the most realistic person throughout the story since she doesn't want any trouble and tries to remain passive since she knows that there's no idea in trying to battle with a bunch of children.*Spoiler* The Biggest Bully, ""Brett"", is a stereotype. Being abused by his father and taking it out on others. It feels very unusual (perhaps impossible) that a young person has that great thirst for blood, especially considering the neighbourhood where he grew up. His cursing is annoying and he doesn't seem bad-ass when saying ""fokking 'ell"" all the time. Besides, Steve should've realized that taking him down would've ended the conflict immediately since the other chavs wouldn't have the guts to stand up against him if he would've taken down their leader.*Spoiler* The fact that you find yourself laughing sometimes, e.g. when Jenny runs away while Brett decides to burn up the Asian boy (an unlikely event since they knew him well and he apparently lived in their hometown with his mother) and when you're not feeling sad when she kills that kid from ""This is England"" confirms the films lack of emotion.*Spoiler* The ending ruined ""Eden Lake"" entirely for me when Jenny bumps into the brother of one gang member and, accidentally, crashes onto the lawn of Brett's father; it's so coincidental. It's stupid when all of the parents of the children decides to get rid of her, especially because the adult crowd works exactly as their offspring. Are the writers afraid of middle-class countryside Britain? The most positive aspect of ""Eden Lake"" is the young cast's acting which I found both impressive and honest, however the turn of events are unfortunately too stupid and the movie rings of lack of realism.",Eden Lake
361,peter-doczi,Unwatchable primitive misery,1,20 September 2008,"I can not believe some people actually enjoyed it. I had great expectations, I thought OK, lets stand on the side of British cinema and choose an independent film over a blockbuster. I wanted to like it, wanted to see something original and exciting and I got everything but. We have horrible, completely unlikable characters, a young couple, both of them total idiots. Spoilers: Female lead is a teacher who loves kids, her boyfriend wants to propose to her, so he takes her to a deserted lake, a location of a soon to built new residential area of luxury homes. Now it's just a lake, where the local scally lads are listening to loud music and spend their time bullying each others. These young kids, aged around 14-16 are the villains of our movie. Very scary indeed. Young, fat, ugly British lowlife scum kids. Terrorising grown adults. Stealing their car, threatening the couple. The young, strong and muscular soon-to-be husband accidentally kill their dog, so they capture him and torture to death, eventually. The soon-to-be bride watch this happening, but she obviously doesn't stop it, but she is trying to connect to her boyfriend's phone from her smart phone via Bluetooth(!), so she can call 999 from that phone. No one's surprised that this fails, and she become the hunted. They have approximately 3 car crashes, she steps into some wood, which she removes by pushing the whole thing through her feet as it is. One could wonder if it wouldn't be slightly easier to pull it out from the way it wounded the feet...I'm sorry, but this is just plain stupid. The characters are not progressing at all, the woman doesn't stop being dumb, and after thinking that she is Rambo and killing one of the gang members, she breaks down and cry meanwhile the buy bleeds to death. In the beginning we hope she will learn to be tough and goes on proper Rambo mode and killing all the little bastards, but since this clearly doesn't happen, near the end we loose all faith in her (and the writer/director) and just hope she will suffer a horrible, tortured death.

362,sebbemungiga,Predictable genre action in slasher movie.,3,10 November 2008,"First, the subject of this movie is promising, it gives the movie the potential of being a strong and disturbing and uncomfortable movie, which is something I appreciate. This is really the kind of things that actually happens out there in real life, and when it does it always send shock waves trough the community and wakes strong reactions from the public; young kids committing violent crimes, teenagers harassing each other or adults as it seems without any moral guidelines, without any limitations in brutality. Juicy! But.. I got disappointed - because like other genre-films in the slasher/gore-class , this is in fact a slasher-movie, also this film follows a pattern: have a build up, and a climax, and what follows is the rest of the film which is very predictable: it contains a line of sequences about running-around in forests, screaming, hiding, getting dirty by all mud, having ones clothes torn apart, bleeding, hiding.. And ..after seeing some of this kind of movies you know exactly what's gonna happen. It is becoming very predictable.If you are into the subject of young folks going over the edge, I would much more recommend a movie like ""Bully"" (or the more Hollywood styled ""Alpha dog"".) I find Bully, which is also about you kids committing violent crimes, much more deeply terrifying and shocking , and that's even if there's no gore or splatter in that movie. It also digs more deeply into the underlying moods of a disrupting society moral that creates the environment for these kind of crimes.",Eden Lake
363,jay-sears,Disturbing and real!,7,4 November 2009,"I've seen a lot of horror type films in my life time. Mostly modern day ones. The majority being awful and badly acted. Typically poor storyline and too much predictability. This film almost got it all right. The acting: The acting in Eden Lake by the two main characters is poor at times, and in particular the female who is woody. When the main action gets under way however the acting does improve slightly, which is a fundamental importance for the film to work. You felt both actors were like robots at times. The kid actors all put in a good performance showing excellent emotion and remorse. Main characters: 4.5/10 (kids: 8/10)Script/Storyline: it is the script that makes this film work. Although predictable at times it is kept to realism and simple format. One of the actors (I'm not saying who to avoid spoilers) frustrated me at times with stupidity - although you could argue this was part of the realism in such a situation (i.e. not thinking straight). Simple and very effective. 8/10Effects/Score: It's pleasing to see no overdone effects to keep realism in the film. The sound effects and music scores (although not really music) work very well with the film and give it a more intense feel. 9/10Conclusion: I was impressed with the realism of the film, its brutality and disturbing nature. This certainly is not for the faint hearted. I easily managed to forget the poor acting - its not dreadful just below par - to enjoy this film (partly because of the script). It sent a sadness to my heart watching this towards the end making me think that there really are people like that out their. If I enjoy a film I will go and buy it, so is this one I will watch again? most probably yes, despite the acting letting it down I liked the storyline and realism of the film. 6.5/10 (I cant give it a 6.5 so I was generous by giving it 7).

371,sanko_panko,Truly Terrifying,8,7 September 2010,"Eden Lake is proper British horror film. Like Straw Dogs, it is a tense tale of small town malevolence, ostracism, violence and murder. What was frightening initially was the plausibility of the premise: I could see myself going off for a secluded weekend with my partner, as I imagine many of us could. There is a customary atmosphere of building, brooding tension even in the most idyllic shots during the film's opening. The music and the camera-work all manage to effectively convey a deep sense of foreboding. Even the sat-nav chimes in with its own two cents.What followed surpassed my expectations. This is a more violent, tense and genuinely frightening film than I had imagined it could be. Good performances from the doomed couple: Michael Fassbender and Kelly Reilly. Fassbender initially seemed miscast and his lines jarred somewhat but when he got into bloodied, gurgling mode, I could see why he was chosen. Reilly gives a believable, stoical performance as the primary school teacher with - how shall we say - hidden depths.What makes the film is the performance of Jack O'Connell as the lead hoodie. He gives a an unfettered performance of a true psychopath. Even his gang are terrified of him and the scenes where he bullies them into committing horrifying violence are among the most unsettling.There is no unearthly monster in this film. It is the potential for what humans can perpetrate against each other in the absence of morality which forms its core and make it what it is. All in all, it is worth a watch; it keeps you on the edge of your seat for the whole 90 minutes and leaves you feeling more than a little disturbed.",Eden Lake

There's little new in it and many scenes are either utterly implausible or inspired by other, better, films. There are thuggish, rotten kids in society but rarely if ever do they go to the extremes portrayed in this film. In real life this would likely have fizzled out after the initial confrontation on the beach. Its meant be set in a disused quarry but the location looks nothing like an old quarry and the lake is wrong, quarry lakes don't have beaches, they drop away straight into deep water. The film is like an above ground version of The Descent, with the cave creatures replaced by the chav thugs, even the music is very similar. Some scenes are obviously inspired by that film (like when Turgoose's character is stabbed)and the ending is basically a reworking of how The Descent ends in the unedited version (heroine appears to escape then you realise she hasn't escaped after all) Will probably appeal to people who like violent films but others should be warned it contains ugly scenes and there's no happy ending. Definitely in the 'B movie' category.",Eden Lake
375,samtjahjono,Uncomfortable but Riveting,7,27 September 2011,"Just so it's clear to the casual observer, Eden Lake is not a ""scary"" horror film. What it is, however, is extremely intense, making liberal use of visceral sequences of violence and suspense, enthralling viewers with suspenseful morbidity. Once the plot begins to unwind it does so with no small number of sickening moments. Thing is, it's hard to look away despite the nails-on-chalkboard grittiness.Overall, the message of the senselessness of violence and its effect on youth culture is made painfully clear. Still, the ending just seemed like a finishing nudge to the ridiculously-built card house of bad luck on the lead characters' behalf seen in the last couple of acts. Where the film succeeds is in its stark plausibility and emotional connection with the likable leads.Watch if you liked: Heartless, Last House on the Left",Eden Lake
376,ryancahoon,Brings my pee to a boil...,8,5 September 2013,"After being bored to death with modern and mainstream horrors, I was absolutely desperate for a film that would harness my emotions and toy with them more than I was comfortable with. In truth, I was looking for a scare, and I found it. The enemies we encounter in the film aren't the kind we can easily shrug off at the end and say ""Well it's okay, their aren't any zombies/ghosts/aliens/werewolves/etc. in real life, so I'll sleep soundly tonight."" No. These are badly raised, out of control boys, left to their own devices with a variety of sharp and blunt weapons, what could go wrong? This film makes me so angry! I must admit, those teens got me hacked off, it's the only way to describe it, you just wish the police could just arrive and take them downtown, forever... As said before, this film grasps your negative emotions with both hands, and squeezes, tight. Being hunted by a bunch of NEDS (Non Educated Delinquents) with a taste for innocent -just trying to get on with our lives- blood, is scary. Yeah sure if any of them were on their own, anyone could kick their head in, but in numbers, more thugs-more knives, they make a terrifying enemy. So unless you've got a pack of cigarettes handy, maybe even a cheeky drink and craving to feel fear and anguish, then give this movie a watch. Be prepared.",Eden Lake
377,melancholy_rose,"If you like movies about adults acting like pathetic idiots, this one is for you!",1,11 September 2011,"I just recently saw a movie called ""The Children,"" where all of the adults acted like whimpering babies as their 30 pound sandbag kids murdered them. Gangs of little eight-year-old children killed their parents, and all they did was cry about it and get angry at each other if they tried to hurt the ""darling babies."" That movie enraged me, and so does this one.I don't understand it a single, solitary bit. The whole story in this film exists simply because the adults are idiots and make stupid decisions. They are outsmarted by malicious 12-year-old kids, and not only do they allow this to happen, they practically ask for it. It was so unbearable sitting through it, because I was angry throughout the entire thing, watching as two grown human beings bend over and present their wimpy rear-ends to a bunch of resentful, spoiled rotten youths. It wouldn't annoy me so much if the whole ""main characters getting themselves into danger because they're morons"" philosophy wasn't so popular in films these days. I kept thinking to myself that if I had been in their situation, I would-- oh wait, I wouldn't be in their situation, because I'm not an idiot. Watching an hour and a half of whimpering little ninnies crawl around pathetically was one of the most frustrating things I had to endure.I love horror films. I love tension, suspense, and mystery-- especially mystery. This wasn't any of those things. It was garbage, and I'm baffled at how anyone could enjoy it. At so many points, I wanted to shut the thing off and say ""forget it, I don't care how it ends, these characters are too pathetic and stupid,"" but I sat through it to see if maybe, possibly, justice would be served, and those who had their comeuppance would get brutally massacred beyond recognition, if they would suffer the same method the main characters did. I was hoping for such a result, but one never came. It was blundering, bumbling idiocy for the remainder of the movie. The ending was terrible, and it left you feeling a sense of unresolved conflict, with a bitter taste in your mouth akin to that of eating a mouthful of raw eggs and cinnamon. I was actually confused when I saw it, thinking, ""wait, is that it? THAT is the ending?!"" Then I felt even angrier. How could someone write this trash and make it into a film? I guarantee the script said something like this:Adults: Hey kids, I'm sorry to harsh your buzz, but we're trying to have a good time, here, so do you mind moving? Kids: F**K OFF!! Adults: Oh... okay... that's fine. Kids ruin adults' lives. Adults run from kids and cry and suffer horrific injury.FIN!If you're like me, and movies like this anger you, I beseech you to stay away. Please. Don't watch this movie.",Eden Lake
378,BehemothWarrior,One of the darkest depictions of how horrible human beings can be,8,10 August 2018,"This movie starts off as regular horror flick. You see a happy couple on a weekend getaway hanging out and having a good time. And you know something it's going to happen to them. But believe me when I say you won't be prepared for this. Eden Lake is one of the most heartbreaking and grim films I've ever watched. The ending left me deeply frustrated, not because it was bad but because it felt genuine. Like something you could experience out there in the real world and also could serve as a reminder of how agressive and insensitive human beings can be. This is most definitely, not for the faint of heart.",Eden Lake

It was truly one of the most responsibly treated horror/thriller I have ever encountered. Steady in its pace and cruel in its plot, eden lake has set a new benchmark in core horror genre cinema that relies merely on CGI splatter crap in most of the cases so far.OK... you have got to admit it is a bit unrealistic to find a British couple so stupid and teenagers so fiendish, but as far as overall cinematic experience is concerned, eden lake qualifies to scare even the most numb horror fan. That's what we expect when we watch a horror movie i guess.So pettiness aside, eden lake is a good movie and worth a watch. No chance of regretting it.",Eden Lake
380,mikestuhlman,Half of a good movie,5,11 July 2012,"I just finished watching Eden Lake with the girlfriend (who recommended this to me). She knows me to be a big fan of horror and thought I would like it. She was half right.I thought the movie started out quite strong, great performances from everyone, cinematography was nice to look at and all other technical aspects were all in place.My issuesFor the first half of the movie I was very interested, the film was intense, with some good jumps and again some very good acting and tense scenes. I liked the movie up until a little over the half way mark. This is when everything just became to ridiculous.Like some other reviews are saying the two main characters just do some illogical things, at the beginning it is fine as it needs to keep going, but as the script kept relying on these crazy coincidences, like going to the same 4 spots in the entire huge woods, was just too unbelievable after a while. Not to mention, injuries, car crashes, and what not. After a while it just felt too ridiculous to even be plausible.I know you really shouldn't compare movies to real life but come on, her ending up at the parents house at the end of the movie, just as the kids somehow got back to there house around the same time she wakes up was just stupid. Its always disappointing to see such a bad ending in what could have been a very good movie through and through, give it a watch if you like very nihilistic world views and film endings. I will say this Director has quite a bit of perceivable talent, I did greatly enjoy The Woman In Black, he just needs a bit more work on keeping his movies even and not relying on so many coincidences.",Eden Lake
381,x-akurei,Cannot fathom the love that this film receives.,3,27 April 2012,"This film had the potential to be really good, however I for one did not personally enjoy it. The start is promising enough, the modern city, warm colours and happy young couple leading us to initially believe that we will not be watching a horror film. Despite this, the storyline quickly becomes overblown. The gang of ""chavs"" are realistic enough - living in England myself, I have seen and experienced many groups of young people like this, and it isn't unheard of to hear of them carrying out some awful murder as part of their ""fun"". I only feel like this film took the reality a step too far. The violence shown was, in all honesty, unacceptable. As I was watching it, I wondered what sort of person would decide that they wanted to show this kind of torture on film, in such detail... The lead characters were, as are most horror-film-protagonists, rather pathetic. This was another film that, between cringing at the violence, had me shouting angrily at the screen because I couldn't believe how ridiculous they were. Some people may adore this film, but I simply cannot bring myself to enjoy it.",Eden Lake

There is really nothing more to say than that, but for some reason IMDb is forcing me to write more? How does this movie even get a 6.9? That is absolutely ridiculous.. Perhaps the reviewers are mainly American and think that this is some sort of ground breaking and accurate portrayal ""chav"" culture in the UK?

""Eden Lake"" also displays the characters drastic change throughout the film. How beautiful can become ugly. With an all star cast and outstanding vision, this film deserves 10 stars!

The acting is superb; I can't say enough about it. The plot, although not the most original plot, has you guessing and wanting to know how its gonna end. The movie has a great pace, great cinematography and just the right amount of gore and vulgarness. Being an English movie, it has actors and actresses that you are not familiar with which gives it a clean feel to the production. To top it all off, it is definitely a movie to watch with a gf or wife, as they will be clinging to you and wanting to cuddle with you once the movie is over.

The whole plot and story line is just terrible. The girlfriend is sitting right there and doesn't notice that someone came and stole her purse with the keys or doesn't hear the truck being taken is laughable.

Granted, they do go through a shocking and terrifying ordeal, but if he wasn't so concerned with maintaining his 'ego, any person with an element of concern for their loved ones would have left at the first sign of danger.Secondly, the level to which these 'kids' go to in torturing the couple is extremely over the top. I realise that there is a certain bad element in todays youth, but the levels to which Brett and his gang go to are very unbelievable.Finally, the ending events are preposterous and finishes off what is a very unpleasant film.This is a highly shocking and tormenting film that leaves you feeling very uneasy.",Eden Lake

When I read the basic storyline I was intrigued so I asked my friends who watched this movie if it was any good and I got sort of mixed answers so I decided to watch it myself. The first part of the movie created the suspense that was yet to be discovered in the second part and I kind of enjoyed it. The second part was what I really didn't like. I read in some previous reviews that reviewers couldn't predict the end of the movie or predicted wrong. For me this wasn't the case, and for me watching this movie was like watching the same thing that I watched over and over again. The couple being hunted and terrorized, after they've been given a thousand chances to escape they are still coming back, when they finally escape there must be something that keeps them in that forsaken town, and so on and so forth. And lately, I'm starting to realize that meaningless violence is starting to appear in almost every movie, and this one is not exception. I can process when there are some disgusting scenes but when the whole movie is based on violence, I really don't see the point in making these kind of films. Acting was the only thing that satisfied me and kept me in my seat through the whole movie. Kelly Reilly was good as usual but Jack O'Connell as the twisted boy Brett was the one who really carried out the film. Some people say that provocative movie is a good movie and in general I agree but this one made me so angry that I really can't find the way to give it good score. I don't know if this movie was regarded as a horror/thriller or something else but, for me, there wasn't a single scary moment in it. There is one good thing about this movie...

It was truly awful and predictable with huge holes in the plot, no character development and unrealistic scenes throughout.There is no development of characters at all with the most predictable part of the whole thing coming at the end. The father turning out to be violent and obviously the catalyst behind the main hoodies behaviour was predictable, boring and quite obvious. The bullied becomes the bully...how very original. Anybody who thinks this was clever or an interesting take on society is just insane!There is nothing clever in this film, no deep insights into our fears or into society today. We all know there is knife crime, we all know that some kids are violent and have suffered child abuse, bullying and gang mentality and yes, this is terrible. However, this film does nothing to delve into the causes, the solution or any aspect of this. It is just a poor excuse for using what is a hot topic to portray violence, gore and a totally depressing story which was told very badly. I think the thing that annoyed me most about this film is the predictable reaction of people saying what an amazing insight it is into our fears. Seriously? You can read the Daily Mail and get better insights into society.*spoilers* One of the most obvious problems of the film is unrealistic reactions of most of the characters in the film. The part where the boyfriend goes into the house to confront the kids was just awful, under no circumstance would that happen in any real life situation. This happened right the way throughout the film too, the girlfriend waiting overnight rather than going to get help after the boyfriend was trapped in the car? The couple returning to the same scene the day after their first altercation with the gang? The car that came just 'happened' to be driven by a relative of one of the gang? The first house that the girlfriend arrived at after her escape was filled with the parents of the gang? Come off it!The chase scenes weren't so much intense as predictable and unrealistic. Somehow in a huge forest the kids could hear everything and were only ever just around the corner? Overall this was a terrible film with no redeeming qualities. Disturbing yes but mainly due to the predictable reactions of people saying how insightful this film was.",Eden Lake

Anyway,except from that i don't think that this movie has anything new,just the good and successful story of a couple or a group of people going for some vacation on an isolated place and ""unluckily"" and accidentally they run into on some maniac bla bla bla bla.See this movie if you are bored like me.5/10 for me just for the violence.",Eden Lake

When the ""bad"" kid says, ""lets get them!"", it's in a tone akin to, ""hey, lets ride our bikes to the park"".So there is lots of chasing and various obstacles that slow down the two victims. But since it's all so unbelievable, there is no real tension.The ending is preposterous and perfectly destroys what little merit this horror/thriller may have had.I like a good horror movie and gore is not a turn-off to me.

419,kirka004,Brit flick horror about ferral youths hunting a couple in the woods.,6,26 November 2011,"Lake Eden is a British film about a nice couple falling foul of a bunch of teenage tearaways out in the woods. The action takes place at an abandoned quarry out in the middle of no where (not an easy thing on an island as densely populated as the UK)where the pair are spending a romantic weekend. The quarry is due to be converted into a gated housing estate (In real life planning permission would not be granted in an area of outstanding natural beauty, like this). If you can get past the first forty five minutes which is full of stupid and illogical decision making by the main characters, then your perseverance will be rewarded. Having been extremely irritated by the first part of the film I was gripped by the second. The level of violence was extreme, and a time line was lacking but unfortunately you could not help but be gripped by the thought that it wasn't as far from reality as you may hope. Post film analysis, this feels like a Brit Flick that has taken on an American feel. Worth a watch, especially if you are a film buff.",Eden Lake

I'm 18, but i seriously think that this film went too far. It made me feel genuinely ill and really quite upset. If this is really what people think of the human race as a whole, we are well and truly f***ed. However, the acting was scarily good and really made you believe in what was happening, which may have made the film even more disturbing. Unfortunately i think the main character of Jenny by the end had been transformed from a women who was lovely at the beginning, and could have taken care of herself, into somewhat of a monster.Generally I like horror films, and this WAS frightening, but i think it was a little too bleak.It really brought me down, so i'm off to watch some kind of feel good film.",Eden Lake

It has a good build up of tension and then a non-stop ride of hate and terror until the chilling climax. Certainly not one to watch for a laugh, it left me feeling hateful, angry and sad. As these are the emotions that I think the director was trying to bring out he has done a stirling job. Although you can see what is going to happen at the end it still comes as a shock - all the more so as no violence is shown. It made me feel sad for the terrifying lonely death she was going to endure. I consider myself to be fairly well experienced when it comes to films but this had me drawn in and captivated - fearful for the stars and hating with all my soul the scum that hunted them.A gem of a film to watch for horror buffs which is made all the more believable with recent media headlines.

We viewers hardly get provoked to punish the negative characters of a movie,i experienced it in this flick.I badly wanna smash those kids whenever the kelly managed to get some weapon like tools with her. The makers of this movie clearly made the characters to interact with viewers,that is missing in most of the movies nowadays.Highly recommended psychological thriller/horror of 2008(note this may sound similar to the movie STRANGERS but EDEN LAKE is more realistic)",Eden Lake
423,lucydique,I can recommend it,8,13 August 2008,"The plot of the movie, as some people have already noticed reminds a lot of ""Ils"". Though the theme is basically the same, the way to introduce it is quite different. ""Ils"" had a bit of a darker atmosphere, i would say, while this one has more tension. Some scenes reminded me of ""High Tension"", though ""Eden Lake"" is, let's say ""lighter"". The French and the British have indeed two different ways of making movies. As someone has already said on the board, you notice that one of them is French and the other one is not, if British or not, i couldn't say, since i don't know many British horror movies, but from the way it is done, it is to be noticed that, despite of the similarities to some French movies, it is not one of them.The movie is quite entertaining, it keeps your attention all the time, it is quite thrilling and it is not very predictable, these would be the positive aspects.Though I have enjoyed the movie quite much, I still find some aspects which are not that great, first of all the topic is not new: as I already mentioned, the topic is basically the same as in ""Ils"". I also found the two adult actors not very convincing, given the situations. They were not bad, but sometimes I found their reactions a bit too soft for the given situation. I cannot say what was ""wrong"" or what they could have done differently, but my impression was that it ""kinda doesn't fit completely"". They were good, though.*****SPOILER********** The end was somehow unexpected and I have liked it... still not 100% new, it reminded me a bit of ""Michael Bay's TCM"", when she ""meets the parents"", still, the very end was good, very hopeless, which is not so common in horror movies.Maybe I have focused in my review more on the negative aspects, but all in all i liked the movie quite much and i would recommend it. 8/10.",Eden Lake

The acting is truly superb with the standout performance by Kelly Reilly as Jenny.The movie has some gore which is used brilliantly without making Eden Lake look like some cheap exploitation movie. Everything that happens in ""Eden Lake"" is believable and this, powered by great use of suspense, is what makes this movie so scary. There are barely any clichés or errors present.

I was entertained watching this movie but when i checked that the time remaining of this movie is almost finish, i got very disappointed that it will end where the evil won. Whatever the writer of this movie got in his mind is full of retarded ideas and imagination. It will be worth to watch if the villain of this movie were apprehended or died slowly and full of pain.

Blames it on her and then his scumbag father and friends finish the job for him. No one calls the cops. The few people who do die are the ones who show remorse for their actions.

I think its a brilliant film, but not a film that you would want to watch too many times. The storyline wasn't the most original story out there, but it was how it was done that made it great. Some scenes were truly horrifying, such as when the kid was set on fire and you can hear his chilling screams, the torture sequence that took place with the boyfriend and the scene right at the end. The ending affected me much the same as it did for the majority of the people out there, but i have to disagree with some and say that the ending is what made the film even more realistic. It certainly didn't ruin the movie, it made it. The harsh fact of reality is that not every situation pulls through with a happy ending. Thats life, no matter how harsh it may seem, whether we like it or not. I know a happier ending would've brought closure, but then it would have just jumped into the category of Hollywood rubbish. We don't always get closure with everything in life, and some things we just have to accept. Yes these were truly disturbed, sick, twisted, horrible teenagers and yes the good guys got what they didn't deserve, same with the bad guys, but thats just the way it goes sometimes.A truly great film but be warned. It isn't for everyone! 8 Stars",Eden Lake

431,ticcer,Good but not brilliant by any stretch,6,18 March 2009,"I watched this film last night after being driven by the favourable reviews on IMDb; statements like ""As the film continues it shocks you beyond belief"", ""gruesome but some scenes are a little too realistic"", and ""this was one hell of a ride!"" While the film does go some way to partially live up to those claims, as a seasoned horror watcher, I found it to be around the medium as far as horror films go... more suspense than horror. Maybe it's just me being a tad desensitised where these things are concerned. It's certainly not a thrill ride, however, the film does move at a nice consistent pace once you get passed the first 30 mins.For me the film is let down by the main male character during those first 30 mins, as he gets himself into situations that only a truly self centered arrogant person ever would... as if the film makers needed some suspenseful moments to fill that time out with and created some silly situations to do so. I found myself thinking, ""No way, who in their right mind would do that?"" But once you get passed all that, the film is very entertaining, with Kelly Reilly from Dead Bodies, et al, putting in very believable performance. The film did leave me with a sense of longing insomuch as it would have been much more satisfying if the main protagonists' revenge was a little more emotionally engaging than the seemingly flippant portrayal it was.If you saw and liked Funny Games, starring Naomi Watts and Tim Roth, then Eden Lake is very well worth the watch.",Eden Lake
432,mashfoj,Brilliant film... but maybe not for everyone.,10,5 June 2013,"I will start by saying that this is quite possibly the best horror/thriller I have ever watched, so much so that this is the first review I've written for any movie.Quite simply, this film provides raw emotion and allows you to connect with the characters like no other. I felt genuine anger, frustration and hatred during the film, compounded by the ending which was so excruciatingly frustrating, but powerful nonetheless. Some will point to somewhat unrealistic moments as flaws, such as when Jenny happens to stumble into the house of the boy she killed - but if these moments ruin the film for you, I fear you may not have really grasped the point of it; it isn't about everything fitting together perfectly, or happy endings, or providing viewer satisfaction for everyone. I would tell you what it is about, but the brilliant thing about this film is that afterwards, I couldn't put my finger on what made it so damn good. It just was, it got to me, it made me feel emotion like no other film. It's really disturbing how this makes you want Jenny to take revenge on the young chavs, but how, when she does kill two of them, you suddenly feel sadness, remorse and guilt - just like Jenny.If you want to watch a film for a fantastic plot, then this may not be for you as really it can be summarised in a few bullet points: - couple go on romantic weekend in the middle of nowhere - couple are disturbed by, and then hunted by a group of knife-wielding chavs - man is killed, girl gets revenge and escapes to civilisation only for there to be a dramatic twist at the end.But this film isn't there to be watched or necessarily enjoyed - it is there to be felt. Put yourselves in the shoes of Jenny and/or Steve, develop sympathy for them (which is easy to do), share in their hatred, anger and frustration and you will find this a truly remarkable film.(p.s. I imagine this would be a perfect film for any melancholics out there!)",Eden Lake

The scenes are nasty and upsetting and is not something I could get any enjoyment out of. Don't get me wrong, I am a great fan of the horror genre but this is something different. In my opinion it wasn't scary it was just nasty and there is a clear difference between the two. If you are a fan of torture films where the victims are given no justice then you will probably really like this film.The film is good in the way that it does play on contemporary fears (chav culture etc etc)and most people of today's age can relate to it in some way or another which in turn does a great job of making you feel really tense and on edge for most of the film. It does this as well for the 2nd two thirds of the film without giving you any 'breathers' or breaks from the tension so to speak. I actually felt quite tired after watching it for feeling so tense for so long!

I think the final scene with Brett should have been taken out, it almost makes him look like he's proud of what he did.It is disturbing and I was shocked myself, but everything is this film is realistic and plausible and could happen. It just shows you of the growing society that we live in today, caused mainly by no discipline. Unlike the vast majority of other films, this movie did not at any point seek to glorify or condone what the children were doing.

After leaving the comfy confines of London, and arriving in a quiet country town, it is quickly established that the area is populated by ex-con, benefit scrounging chavs. After which comes the English equivalent of Deliverance, with the lovely couple pursued endlessly by a group of 14 year olds, who casually carry out torture, whilst filming the acts on their camera phones. Unlike ""Mum and Dad"" which successfully spawned a believable unhinged family, hell-bent on causing as much pain and suffering as possible, ""Eden Lake's"" chav gang are lazy creations, which stick to the media's stereotype of Broken Britain, and will only add to future prejudice. The happy couple too are a little stuck in stereotype land. The innocent teacher is too scared to run when her boyfriend is being slashed up by the kids, and is naive right up until her sticky end at the rather irritating finale. I cannot stand films like this, ""Eden Lake"" is more frustrating than thrilling, and all too often I found myself screaming at the stupidity of the characters, and how poorly written they were.

The movie keep with a good plot until near the end, then you see what is coming and personally I was very disappointed. I think is the same thriller movies that we are used to expect from : an unhappy ending. This is becoming very usual in the cinema.

This movie has affected me more then any normal horror or thriller, as this horror could actually happen to anyone, anywhere. What I normally enjoy about a thriller is the fiction part and thats also why it usually doesn't affect me emotional. This movie just shows us how 1 or 2 parents can ruin so many lives of children and other people. These kind of movies are here got 2 reasons to me: 1. to be enjoyed 2. to realize how a parent can actually affect a child I saw the latter in this movie, it made me learn yet another thing how simple bullying can turn into something worse and can be without limits.The actors in this movie made an excellent performance, all of them showed emotions perfectly to every situation during the movie.

441,little-tornado,"""No need for hillbilly mutants here!""",9,1 December 2010,"I began watching this film with NO idea what it was about. When a film begins with characters setting out on what is meant to be an idyllic camping trip to a secluded woodland, I always expect the villain to be one of either a cannibal, mutant, hillbilly or inbred race(as demonstrated in films such as Wrong Turn and Deliverance)and I thought no differently when I began to watch Eden Lake. What makes this film unique and more disturbing than other films of this genre is that the protagonists are being terrorised by British youths that are recognisable to any person living in our current society. As it becomes clear the group of teens that our two protagonists meet in the forest are more aggressive and threatening than first thought, it really does hit home what horror and violence human beings are capable of - no need for mutant hillbillies in this film. Jack O'connels character, Brett, is merciless, aggressive and misguided creating a truly dangerous character who is also very real.You can barely fault the acting in this film, especially that of Michael Fassbender who's performance as Steve is subtle and heart-warming, which makes you feel for his character almost as Kelly Reillys character, Jenny does. The two play a couple who are perfectly in love and their relationship is wonderfully portrayed on screen with great chemistry between the two actors making the gruesome scenes that happen throughout the film tragic and difficult to watch.The film is fast paced with a well developed narrative that is frustrating, exciting and tragic. There is gore and threat throughout and non of the content in this film is hard to believe. Rather than large machetes, chainsaws, streamers and other brutal, imaginative weaponary used in films such as Saw and Hostel, all Eden Lake uses is a small knife, a chain and mobile phone to create some really sickening scenes- and it works! The film brings out emotions I never expected it to, as well as being an entertaining horror flick. Thought provoking and exciting, Eden Lake will not be easily forgotten. Enjoy.",Eden Lake

You are never left feeling that the acting is awkward or strained. The story line has been well thought out and the film hits all the right buttons for its genre type.You all know by now how the film pans out and the general premise but its important, I think, to know how this film may leave you feeling.Personally, I can watch anything, no matter how gruesome or affecting but yet somehow this film left me feeling agitated and above all, angry.So much so that If I had voted for this film at the time I would have scored it a 4/10. After all, how can it be a good film if it leaves you feeling like that! But after a debate in my own head I conceded that in the end, Its what makes this film different. And it is actually very good and well done. I gave it a 7/10. Whilst in theory I would have given a higher mark than this, I have to also take into account that, generally, films still really shouldn't make you feel like this. Should they? Naturally I don'g want to give anything away so I cant really say much, and I wouldn't want to. Just be warned, if you have any morals and feeling about you, this film may well leave you feeling angry and this time there is no closure to your feelings, no one to hit, no one to take your frustrations out on, it will leave you hanging.Its a very emotional film, and not in the loving sense either. Its not for the feint hearted and its not for the easily upset. Its not that there is tons of blood and gore either.

This a poor excuse for writing, directing, and producing. The lack of creativity and insightfulness was compensated with violence instead of substance. It is also a shame that such talented actors were wasted in a pointless film. I joined IMDb just to write a review on this movie because it angered me that much.Apart from the fact that some scenes did not make sense, were not logical, and were not realistic, this movie offers nothing to the viewer except expected outcomes and glorifying the actions and lives of disturbed youth.*spoiler*It is a shame when our society is sinking so low that we rent (and some viewers actually liked this movie - most disturbing of all!) these type of movies and let the youth of our society grow up watching these movies. A world without consequences. A world where murder, torture, violence towards women and animals is accepted (even glorified). Our society needs to wake up and realize that movies like this CONTRIBUTE to the growing problems of our troubled youth. Movies like this fuel the fire of unexpressed anger in kids and adults. As a society we need to demand more creativity, intelligence, and insightfulness from our entertainment. If the writer/director wanted to delve into the psyche behind troubled youth they could have done so in a constructive way.",Eden Lake

Afterwards you go have lunch and head back to the lake like nothing ever happened. I couldn't watch anymore, not because of the horror, but because of the way they portrayed this couple as a pair of idiots. Unbelievable! These thugs steel their SUV and nearly run them over. What do they do? Well they follow them instead of getting help. One guy vs. a group of thugs?? Jenny and Steve then get their SUV back after killing the thug's dog. Without headlights they speed through the woods, which by the way they are unfamiliar with and slam into a pile of trees, pinning the boyfriend in the SUV .He is captured and tortured.

My other half, who usually handles horror flicks well, could not make it through this one. I have to give special props to the director, who took a simple subject and made it nail-biting for the duration. There was one scene involving home invasion that was weird, but everything else was perfect, from the Pub scene to the BBQ. The kid actors were great. The leads were stereotypes, but so natural and familiar. It's too ""real"" for some horror fans, which is weird, because shouldn't the standard for horror be how horrifying something is? Eden Lake is horrifying. No gratuitous gore, just bad circumstances, wicked villains, unfiltered panic and desperation. This could actually happen. Anywhere. Eden Lake unnerved me.",Eden Lake

It is very seldom that a movie causes me to cringe, but this one did - several times. Kelly Reilly was perfectly cast. It was staggering to see her transform from a sweet, pretty elementary school teacher to half crazed (but still pretty) survivalist. Seriously, even bloody and caked in mud, she was still pretty, amazing! There is one problem that I have with the movie, and it is a problem that I have with horror, thriller movies in general; do not go into a psycho's house. Whether you are invited or not, stay the heck out. That is the reason I did not give this movie a 10. Though this is my first review, I have already decided that a movie will lose a point every time someone just walks into a stranger's house. In closing, this is not a feel good movie. On the contrary, it can be a pretty grueling experience in parts. It is just for this reason that I have subjected myself to viewing it over and over again.

450,shutout_31,What would you do in their situation?,9,30 January 2013,"I thought this movie had excellent acting, cinematography, and was so realistic it was heart- wrenching. I really did enjoy the plot, despite some of the holes, and I thought the ending was horrifying and well done. Although I do agree that some parts of the plot are implausible (Steve entering the house without permission, Jenny spending the night in the woods instead of running to the main road to get help) I have to take a step back and reconsider what I might do if I were in their situation.For example, I'm absolutely positive that if I were watching the torture of my boyfriend, I'd be too stunned and heartbroken to run away. Even just the thought of him possibly dying while I'm off trying to get help would be enough to make me stay. Perhaps I wouldn't have stuck around as long as Jenny did, but it's hard to assume that I would have immediately run and left my love there at the mercy of a bunch of thugs who are stabbing him with exacto blades, when all I would want to do is try and save his life.It's easy enough for to assume that anyone else would do the opposite of the main characters' actions, and I definitely don't think I would've returned to the lake after the first run-in with the kids, but it's hard to put myself in the situation to guarantee that I would do exactly the right thing at exactly the right moment.Overall, I can't say I enjoyed watching this film, but I thought it was wonderful -- incredibly well done.",Eden Lake

The movies succeeds in every way and delivers more than just your ""average thriller flick"". The rage and emotion gets in your skin for the whole movie and sometimes u watch it with great suspense and excitement. The story is about 2 lovers: Steve and Jenny . They go for the weekend in the wildness for relaxing. They find themselves bullied by some mid teen kids with no respect. First they looked just like a bunch of lads that could cause some problems but nothing that could seem like a big deal. Steve and Jenny find themselves with no car and no purse. From here the movie takes an 90 degree turn and the story gets more interesting and I have to add unpredictableVerdict: If u are a thriller fan or you haven't seen a good thriller in a while your you simply want to see a good ""edge of your seat"" movie then I warmly recommend ""EDEN LAKE""My Rating: 8/10",Eden Lake

These kids and the leader mainly who forced them to torture the couple and set a kid on fire just gets off free. And, to make it worse the poor lady finds a house but its where the parents of these children are partying and they find out she killed a couple of the kids that were torturing her so of course a few of the guys take her in the bathroom and kill her and the movie ends. I hope this review saves you the time of torturing yourself by watching this movie.There's a reason it only made a little over $5,000 in the US.

As a horror, it should give you some adrenaline in your blood. But, instead Mr.James Watkins gives you an unhealthy, sick and poor screenplay as well as the direction. It's not about the heavy violence scenes in it.It is a horror and you would expect some of them. It just, at some point, it stops to be a movie and turns into some untalented psycho-made scenes that doesn't make any sense. The film's got an idea, but no normal human would express it, like Mr. Watkins did in that film. Besides being psychopathic, much of the film is just uninteresting and poorly planned.

Then the realisation that the 'chav' kids were the horror, I lost faith. Although the film was well acted it was a poor attempt at a British horror. Unfortunately 'chavs' like this do exist and perform these 'gang rituals' so perhaps this should have been a documentary on teens in Britain but it wasn't a horror film. Just a cold, sad, and true representation of what kids of today are capable of. Unnecessary justification and glorification of 'chav' family gang violence. Those who rate this as a good film need to question their sociop*thic brains and should seek help soon! Pathetic film, bring back the traditional horrors please!",Eden Lake
461,drumbouke,Finally a modern horror movie that doesn't turn out to be a comedy.,7,27 October 2011,"This movie is about a couple taking a romantic trip to the Eden Lake area, where they plan to have a quiet romantic weekend. However, from the moment they arrive, ""their"" beach also houses a group of noisy kids who slightly bother them. These kids turn out to be way tougher than the couple estimated them to be. Inspired and pushed by their leader, they turn out to be not just verbally aggressive.I am pleasantly surprised with the modest amount of fuss in this movie. It allows me to take the thrill more seriously. It wouldn't be the first time I laugh instead of being scared, watching a horror movie.Concerning the action and horror, I think those are very well dosed in this movie. The build up is thought through rather nicely. Things helping to separate this from the ordinary are the amount of daylight scenes, instead of just the first 5 minutes, and the camera work. They didn't use exciting camera angles for every pet that crosses the street. The details carry a well-balanced build up throughout the whole movie too.I wouldn't say this is a masterpiece, but when you feel like watching a horror, at least it rises above horror movies you check out on IMDb and back down from, because of the risk of it being too silly and exhausting.

Most of the characters completely bypassed typical responses to the situations they were confronted with. No attempt was made by the couple to reason with or even talk to the children, to try to turn them against each other, for instance, or make them think about how they'd likely spend the rest of their lives in prison for their crimes. Even a simple ""don't do this"" would have added a desperately needed touch of reality. The other kids also could have easily ganged up on the leader and stolen the phone from the girl, so why didn't they, and how does one of the children go from being completely unwilling to do harm to the man to shoving a razor into his mouth? Would they really ever have thought they'd get away with three murders? The questions just pile up, and the ending was a tragic confirmation of the writers' juvenile ""violence is cool"" mentality.

466,rgseconds,Best Brit horror for a long time. Spoilers included.,9,14 September 2008,"Saw this film yesterday and my legs are still shaking.It's a film of our time, certainly for us Brits. The story strikes a very raw nerve, but also has the guts not to pull any punches and not to sit on the fence because it clearly points the finger of blame at the parents of the kids and the pressures of peer pressure in young gangs, which has been fed by the parents' attitudes toward their own children. These adults show no responsibility for their children and blame the victims for what happens in the story rather than confront the truth about the monsters (brutal, confused, ugly, sad things) they have created through their neglect, self absorption and jaw-dropping denial of their parenting roles. ""Not mine!"" says one of the parents when the film's male protagonist asks who the gang of kids who've wrecked his car are. ""Not mine!"" Just sums it up. The parents take no responsibility. Their kids are lost, have no moral guidance, little or no empathy for others because they know no better, the thrill of aggression and violence seems the only thing that makes them feel anything. These messed up kids are basically left to implode.What is so powerful about this brilliantly directed and written film, is the feral kids and the young leader who drives events, are as much the victims as the young couple.I must add that both Michael Fassbender and Kelly Reilly are outstanding as the doomed couple.This is not your average horror flick. It's far more and should be screened to politicians and head teachers so they start to comprehend the true horror we are facing in our society. It may be a fictional story, but the fact is, what happens is all too real and plausible.This is a chilling, emotional onslaught.

While there are amazing loopholes in some scenes, like the phone with the full signal trying to pair, the undertone of the movie and its ending makes it more realistic and pragmatic than the general run of horror movies. This was one point I did not expect to see.As far as character development goes in the Horror genre this movie wasn't lacking by any means. Within the limits of the script the kids apart from the leader, took the torture of the couple to a point where it was just the 'other group'. Their lack of empathy however did not stop them from abandoning the group when one of their own was killed.Brutality is strongly felt coming in waves at almost every turn. The threat of violence especially when knowing the plot of the story, is constantly present throughout the movie. While the making-out of the couple is rather irritating at the starting points of the movie(for a horror fan), the need for such scenes is understandable as the movie folds out. The betrayal of Adam, the oafishly violent mindset of the 'gang', the ignorance of adults over the true nature of their kids and, the ending are true portrayals of Horror. The ending alone is...This is not just any Horror movie, but one of the very best. It twists all the expectations born out of the mind-set of a normal man and presents an image of dark fearful contrast. To hate this movie is quite normal and to say it is just heavy gore or needless brutality is just completely understandable.

I've rarely felt this strongly negative in my reaction to a film, this one might take the cake. Not sure if I've seen a more stupid, aggravating movie -- the characters (both the ""good"" and the ""bad"") all behave so idiotically and nonsensically, and also often in bizarrely psychotic ways, that I quickly had a very hard time caring about anything that was happening on screen. As far as plot developments, this film managed to string together every horror/thriller cliché it could lay its hands on, leaving me in a near-constant state of eye-rolling. I imagine partly why Eden Lake got this far under my skin is that everything that transpires would be so easily avoidable, it can't help but make the entire plot feel completely contrived and unnecessary.Also, the score was soooo bad it was cringeworthy, it added a thick layer of sap on top of everything with its heavy use of sad-face strings, commanding us to feel deeply sad for the sad events that are happening to the sad people. Some might argue ""but people like this exist!"" and while that seems debatable to me, it's also beside the point, because the manner in which this film depicts its characters and drives its plot forward utterly fails to connect to the audience in a meaningful way. If you haven't already spent the 90 minutes on this one, I suggest you spend that time elsewhere.",Eden Lake

I feel the movie is showing some mentalities and psychosocial characteristics of many people, that get such demonic characteristics from family, society, relations, and etc. 
YES, many kids get violent, as a consequence of some intertwined life through upbringing.
Yes, many get callous, dumb, terrorist, killers, thiefs, like where do criminals come from, outer space?
Besides, those ones families sure share many degrees of such traits, which they caused anyway. Like, I don't get the idea of such rejecting reviews here. 
Yeah, the movie is taking it to the edge, it not out of silly imagination, or incredibility. Those characters, do live, those characteristics did and do exist.

I was so angry with the director and myself that I had to watch another movie to get a complete feel. First one hour or so was full of nail-biting suspense and thrill. Young couple harassed by teenagers and then what happen as usual. Picturisation is perfect but once the movie is over you will feel you just wasted your time. The women didn't seek any revenge?! At the end the only solace to me was quite weird-the peoples ravaged her and she got punished for her stupidity. Can a women be such dumb??!! I was waiting for the teenage boys to be killed like that in wrong-turn. But that didn't happened-so this movie sucks. In my recommendation don't watch this movie. If you cant resist then watch the first 50 minutes and then watch the last 40-50 mins from Harry Brown or Law abiding citizen or memento or any revenge movie.,Eden Lake

After watching a series of particularly bad films, films that have somehow managed to achieve a semi respectable rating and overall positive reviews from the critics, I feel that I need to voice my opinion. The incomprehensible actions of all of the characters involved in this film would be somehow justified if the film was to serve a greater good, or to expose the viewer to some kind of message or deeper meaning, however I can see nothing positive to be gained from this title. The plot of the film is a very British take on youth violence and the darkest actions of these ""loutish youths"" we seem to hear so much about today.The 2 tag lines for the film sum up the overall plot and mood of the film.A weekend by the lake, with views to die for.They wanted to get away from it all. Instead, they found...Based on these tag lines I was apprehensive towards the title, but seeing the majority of excellent reviews in I thought I would give the film a shot, like I have with a few other films mainly found through IMDb, and especially reminiscent to Funny Games. Disappointment and an overwhelming sense of frustration ensued. The actions of the female lead from around the 30 minute mark are what I believe causes many people to detest the overall ""horror"" genre. ""Why are you doing that? Why are you falling over? Why don't you get help like you were meant to be doing? Why are you throwing away your only means of self defense, for the third time? Why...? All of these combined with the questionable judgment of virtually all of the cast from beginning to end makes for a underwhelming and disappointing experience.The reason I gave the 1-star-above-the-minimum is because the acting was great from everyone involved, and the production quality is very high, it's just a shame it's for a poor script and film, it could have been so much better.To sum up my experience (tl;dr) - follow the opinion of the disillusioned, they often went in with mediocre expectations, or through a recommendation from a ""professional critic"", only to be so disappointed they had to voice their opinion such as with me.2/10",Eden Lake

Let me start by telling you to just watch this film before you get put off by some of the user reviews then make your own opinion, but for me this was a brilliant, gripping, gruesome movie and finally something that isn't soo over the top to even be remotely realistic like some of the Hollywood bs. *Spoilers* OK so i read here that some users said few of the scenes from the movie are not realistic and would never happen in real life....for example, when the protagonist walks into a random house and looks inside...i can tell this user has never personally been in such situations hence why you would say this but sorry to say i have. when you are annoyed and you go to knock on someones door they don't open you peep inside, curiosity drags you further in my friend. its life just cause you wont do it doesn't mean someone else wont. secondly i read why was it the guy who rescued her happened to be related to the gang that were after her! well 'duh' he was looking for his brother which he clearly mentions and it was dark so obviously the chances of someone driving around there is going to be a relative of them.... anyways I'm going on, but the only reason I'm giving it a 8 is because i know I've seen better films, this one has its flaws but they are so minor you almost don't care, you feel emotion towards the characters you hate the antagonists which is what it wants you to do, there is no guns, chainsaws, masked menaces its a pure gripping gruesome which makes it realistic as if you become the characters and want them to survive.

Let me just start saying that I needed a really long shower after watching this movie!
This is one of those movies keeps you wondering of what the hell is going to happen next! I honestly think this movie is somewhat of a thriller movie too because it really draws you in and keep you focused all the way. I felt shivers down my spine and in my shoulder in a lot of the scenes. I think the movie did a great job of making me think ""There's is no way in hell I'm going out to the woods"". It seems ridiculous, I know but I guess that's why this movie is so horrifying *ba dum tss* (sorry, I know it's bad, but I had to)Before, I get to my what I disliked of the movie, I would like to say that the actors did a brilliant job on their roles especially the teen roles, bloody brilliant 😁First star deducted because various illogical situations:1-who the in their right mind would go in the middle of the woods without any form of protection! I mean look, I'm neither English nor American, so I don't know about the laws of carrying any forms of protection/weaponry with you but even the most careless human beings would carry something if they are a small group of individuals going to the middle of nowhere. I mean come on not even a tour guide that know how bad the this town is?!2-Once Steve and Jenny have seen that these teens are very stubborn and might cause some serious trouble and they hike and go around the same area as themselves and that these teens have a dangerous dog (a rottweiler I think and yes I had to google it), why the hell couldn't bring some pretection then?3-Why in the hell didn't Steve report the flat tires to the police instead of talking to an ignorant waitress?! In fact, why didn't he go straight to the police instead of heading to eat breakfast?!4-How come a responsible sane adult like Steve would be ok to commit a crime by breaking into a stranger's home of what might be the home a very troublesome teeneger whom (Steve) he has some doubt or idea that this might be the house of the wife-beater he overheard the day before he he went to the lake. And when he was able to get back to his car, how come he didn't tell Jenny about what happened inside and that the wife-beater might be Brett's father or at least told her to avoid going to that house no matter what.5-What was that stupid BS about Jenny connecting her phone via bluetooth to Steven's to call the police? First of all, that's not how bluetooth works, AT ALL. carriers of Both mobiles needs accept the synchronization for bluetooth to work. Which means that there is the possiblity of Steve not being able to accept the synchronization or someone will discover that she was close enough to be in range for bluetooth to detect a singnal. Another thing, I'm almost sure you can't use the other device make a call. Finally, how come she doesn't have phone; Need I remind you, they went IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE TO SPEND THEIR WEEKEND FFS!!!!Second Star deducted because of the ending is SO damn bland and tastelss and leaves the viewer a LOT (and I mean A LOT) to be desired; for an example:1-What the hell happen to Jenny? I mean why in the hell end such a movie with cliffhanger. I seriously would love to see what happened to her. Did they kill her? If so how? Or did enslave her until she somehow got away? Another thing, once she was trapped and locked in the bathroom, she knew that she was discovered by a group much worse than murderous teens and that she won't be able to get the hell out yet she found a razor which in my opinion she should have used herself if you catch my drift. YES, suicide would have been (to me at least) a less bland for an ending instead of Jenny's unknown fate.2-I understand how the makers wanted give the idea of ""hey, that psyhopathic teenager that burned an adult and impubescent child and most likely caused another adult to be killed, might still be amongst you"" for the horror factor. But as a viewer I think it would have satisfying and would definitly make up Jenny's known fate if he got what he deserved when becomes an adult or something like that.",Eden Lake

I didn't find that it was poorly acted - the actors seemed to make the best choices (aside from agreeing to be in the film) with such dismal material.
I realize a good horror film succeeds in scaring you. It does achieve that. But not in a way that thrills you and ultimately satisfies. It is agony to experience and horrific to watch and the only reason we didn't turn it off was in the hope that by the end there would be at least some measure of justice. Nope.

I think it is one of those films that gets to you and haunts you after it's done.I felt for the victims which is rare however having personally been on the receiving end of youth violence I can say that maybe a bias of mine. The film certainly starts slow and the two lead characters relationship feels strong with their respective actors/actresses but once we meet the main antagonists it really kicks off around the half way point with multiple deaths, torture of varying gruesomeness and a plot that puts its victims in repeated danger.The end twist is well crafted though I personally fault the logic of asking strangers for help over emergency services was thin, but still.

We are talking about ""Why are you eating spoonfuls of peanut butter after telling us you have a mortally severe peanut allergy and that you just want to survive?"" level incomprehensible behavior on the part of the films central characters...and consistently, from start to finish.

I think of the director and I see a person who just wanted to make us to feel angry, upset and powerless during more than 70 minutes. And then, that he enjoyed so much to see how frustrating we felt with his detestable ending. There's no way the director can claim the opposite, because he made the less damaging characters die, whereas the most brutal and loathsome ones got away with everything. Specially Brett, the one we all wanted to kill with our bare hands. There are scenes gruesomely graphic, like when they are stabbing Steve. That was just bad taste, absolutely unnecessary. And the leads are always in disadvantage. They could never have the upper hand and that's ridiculous in a movie. We are supposed to see ups and downs in a character, not somebody who's always a a victim... just to end up seeing them dead or implying so. I cannot understand how so many people praise the ending just because justice was not served and thus the easy path was avoided. Bullshit, because that works in a movie in which you don't see the protagonists suffer the way those did. This director obviously made us to desire justice, but he wouldn't give it to us. That's why I hate this movie and I think this is the lowest level cinema can reach. Not only that. The movie is itself pointless, without character development or evolution. I hated, I really hated it. Do you know what makes this movie so bad? Making you wish it finish because you can't stand the pain the leads are being through. That's what happened to me and I know a lot more of people too.
