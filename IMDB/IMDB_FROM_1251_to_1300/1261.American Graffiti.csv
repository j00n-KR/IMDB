0,MartinHafer,The right film at the right time.,7,10 August 2011,"Whether you love this movie or not, you have to admire this movie for two reasons. First, its return on the dollar was among the best ever for any film. While the budget was a very modest $777,777.111 (no kidding), it returned $115,000,000 in the United States alone! No wonder this film made George Lucas famous. Second, it was very innovative. While I was not a huge fan of the film's style, it was unique and sure had an impact on the world as well as future films. No one had made a film like this before--chock full of one song after another blaring across the soundtrack and its odd semi-structureless plot was also quite unique.The film concerns a bunch of young adults just hanging out and cruising. There really isn't a lot more to it than that. Sure, their stories all reveal a bit about them through the course of the film, but most of the characters have no great depth. It's more like you are a voyeur watching some likable and not especially likable kids doing...well...nothing. Now if you grew up in the early 60s and remember all this, then it's a great stroll down memory lane. If you didn't, I think the movie will be more of a tough sell, as the nostalgia angle is non-existent. As for me, I wasn't even born until 1964, so the nostalgia aspect was less--but I loved the music and great cars. My daughter, while less impressed about EVERYTHING did grudgingly say that the music was great. She also said that she pretty much ignored the plot and just listened to the songs! And, perhaps, this is pretty typical of a person from her generation. As for me, the film was mildly interesting and I respect it--though I did not love it. This isn't really meant as a criticism--just a statement about how this film appealed to this 47 year-old guy. For the right audience, it's the perfect film. Otherwise, you might feels it's all a bit overrated.Aside from the nostalgia for the early 60s, the movie also is quite interesting when seen today because so many future stars and super-stars are in it--mostly when they were young unknowns. Ron Howard (a child star but not all that popular yet as an adult), Cindy Williams, Harrison Ford, Richard Dreyfus, Charles Martin Smith, Mackenzie Phillips and Suzanne Somers all appear in the film.",American Graffiti
1,Leofwine_draca,Portrayal of a great era,6,8 June 2016,"American Graffiti is the second film from George Lucas, made after his quirky sci-fi effort THX 1138 but before he gave up crafting real characters in favour of larger-than-life comic book fantasy entertainment. It's a paeon to a long-forgotten world that was the 1950s, and features as its cast a bunch of high school students celebrating graduation with all of the angst that comes with it.Films like this tend to be pretty easy to like, because the topics are universal and the situations are easy to identify with. Some of the themes covered here include machismo, gang culture, romance, nostalgia, and the ever-difficult transition from childhood to adulthood. American Graffiti isn't exactly a world-changing film but I found it likable enough, and the cast (including Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, Charles Martin Smith, and Harrison Ford in early roles) are very good.One of the things I liked most about American Graffiti is the soundtrack. It's much better, say, than the original music in GREASE; I love 1950s film and many classics are featured here. Occasionally (and annoyingly) the song gets cut off halfway through, but nonetheless the soundtrack helps to make this film both likable and fun.",American Graffiti
2,SnoopyStyle,nice slice of an era,7,19 December 2014,"It's the end of the summer 1962 for a bunch of high school graduates. Curt Henderson (Richard Dreyfuss) is unsure about college. Steve Bolander (Ron Howard) expects to leave town tomorrow with Curt. He tells his girlfriend Curt's sister Laurie (Cindy Williams) that he wants to date other people while he's away. Terry ""The Toad"" Fields is their flunky friend. John Milner is their friend who's stuck in town. As they drive around on the strip, Curt is entranced by a girl (Suzanne Somers). John picks up little Carol Morrison (Mackenzie Phillips). Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford) is looking to race John. The Toad is driving Steve's car and meets the experienced Debbie Dunham (Candy Clark).George Lucas presents a convincing slice of American life. It's the music, the cars and the style of his youth. As an artifact, it's a terrific piece of a moment in time. As a story, it's rather scattered. The characters have their own separate stories. It would be more compelling to have them together developing chemistry and advancing their relationships. It is interesting to see some actors in their youth.",American Graffiti
3,Hitchcoc,It's of a time and place.,8,17 March 2006,"The first time I saw this film, I was utterly taken with it. My folks ran a restaurant which became a hangout for the kids of the mid to late fifties and early sixties. It wasn't a drive in, but it became a place for much of what went on in this movie. We were in a small town, so there are urban elements that didn't apply. But there was cruising. There were fights. There were tough guys. I remember John Steinke who spent his Saturday evenings shooting up people's mailboxes with his .22. Most of the kids were normal kids. Some portrayals of the fifties make it seem like everyone had a leather jacket and a duck tail haircut. These were just a small percentage. Most postured and pranced around like the kids we have today. Different times; same basic behavior. I loved the mythos. The girl in the white car. The average Joe (Richard Dreyfuss). The nerd. The girl friend who you thought would be your love forever. The scary future. It's all here. Then there is that midnight journey, that quest. Wolfman Jack, whose career was really made big by this film. The police, who are understandably obsessed with these hoods and what they do. It's a lot of fun. I don't know why, however, this film didn't wash quite as well the last time I saw it. Was it too many Happy Days episodes? Is it less relevant now? Have we no innocence? I just didn't feel the magic. Or is it that I was so much closer to the ages of the characters when I saw it the first time. It's still a landmark film. The cinematography is striking. See it if you haven't.",American Graffiti
4,mark.waltz,The last summer of youth.,9,26 January 2021,"1962, a summer night of dreams in this musically delightful view of a bunch of high school graduates enjoying cruising the strip for one last night of adventure.
The ensemble of some future big names provides the viewer with not only a nostalgic view to a past that took place a decade before this was made but the future where big stars and legends today when just starting off their career when this was made. Of course, Ron Howard (no longer Ronnie) had been around for quite a while as a child star, and in saying this, you're basically seeing a different version of Richie Cunningham from ""Happy Days"" which was right around the corner. His girl is Cindy Williams, the future Shirley Feeney, and their romantic issues surround the fact that he wants to date other people while continuing to call her his girlfriend.There's also nerdy Charles Martin Smith, nicknamed ""the toad"", an actually cute young man who is insecure in his dealings with the opposite sex, managing to pick up Candy Clark and trying to impress her in the vehicle he has just bought from Howard. Then there's Paul Le Mat, forced to tag along with jail bait Mackenzie Phillips who provides him with an adventure he'll never forget even though he doesn't get what he wants. Richard Dreyfuss is entranced by the blonde in the thunderbird, played by none other than Suzanne Somers who whispers ""I love you"" to him, causing him to roam around all night trying to find her.A great selection of classic songs are heard throughout, making this a huge birthday cake of nostalgia, and of course, ""Rock a round the Clock"" ended up being the opening theme of ""Happy Days* for its first season. outside of a few minor characters, this film is entirely made up of young people, one of the most amusing moments occurring when Smith encounters an obvious street drunk and gives him his money to buy him alcohol, which of course results with the man disappearing out the back.The series of events doesn't create a linear story, but everything is so well edited together that you don't even notice that it's nothing but a series of situations rather than a plot line. Produced by Francis Ford Coppola and directed by George Lucas, this film really stands the test of time for its nostalgic view of an innocent era that really wasn't so innocent, showing the calm before the storm in these young adults' lives. Harrison Ford shows up in a small role, quite funny in his exaggerated performance. The memory of malt shops, hoop skirts, saddle shoes and drag races down busy city streets will give younger viewers an idea of what their grandparents were doing during their innocent years, and for this viewer, taking this trip down memory lane again left me with a huge smile.",American Graffiti
5,classicsoncall,"""You just can't stay 17 forever"".",8,30 April 2011,"Saturday nights have turned into movie night at our household, which includes my wife, my adult daughter and my granddaughter. When my daughter posed the question 'what were the Sixties like', my answer included things like the Kennedy assassination, the Beatles arriving in 1964 to lead the British invasion, LBJ as President, civil rights demonstrations, Woodstock, and finally, Man's landing on the moon in 1969. It was a memorable era, and one that I have the most nostalgia for. ""American Graffiti"" is George Lucas' film tribute to an age of innocence before November 22nd, 1963; it's principal characters coming to terms with the prospect of tomorrow, a tomorrow that can be as awkward as a child taking his first step.That sense of nostalgia plays wonderfully today when you see who turned up in the picture. Richard Dreyfuss and Ron Howard hold lead roles, complemented by the likes of Cindy Williams, Paul Le Mat, MacKenzie Phillips and Bo Hopkins. Harrison Ford makes an early big screen appearance, and the action is all set to a wonderful era score, hosted in the film by legendary DJ Wolfman Jack. The disc jockey has a touching scene near the end of the picture with the Dreyfuss character, one in which he feigns 'knowing' The Wolfman, and promising to put Curt's message on the air to the mysterious blonde in the white '56 T-Bird.Some might say the picture has a dated quality, but heck, I think that's the point. It's a film about the Sixties, particularly the early Sixties, as the Baby Boomer children of the Greatest Generation started to make their presence felt in the world. I'm part of that Boomer crowd, and every day, THOSE times start to look better and better from the vantage point of present day. It was true back in 1940 that 'You Can't Go Home Again' when Thomas Wolfe's novel was published posthumously, and this picture explores some of the angst associated with the knowledge that once tomorrow comes and Curt Henderson heads 'back east' to college, attempts to relive youthful memories with friends and family will forever remain a futile exercise.",American Graffiti
6,gavin6942,Incredibly Entertaining Movie For How Little Actually Happens,8,25 September 2012,"A couple of high school graduates spend one final night cruising the strip with their buddies before they go off to college.What blows my mind about this film is that it is a George Lucas movie. At the time, that meant nothing, but today he is known almost exclusively as the creator of ""Star Wars"". I would suspect that many ""Star Wars"" fans are not aware he made this movie or have even seen it (which is incredibly unfortunate). The only connection I could discern was the cameo from Harrison Ford, who was not yet famous. In fact, none of these people were really famous yet (with the exception of Ron Howard).I do love that essentially the film is nothing but two hours of kids driving their cars up and down a street. And yet, it is incredibly entertaining. There are subplots like the pre-college breakup, the dork getting the girl, the drag race, the street gang... but it all comes back to the cars, the music and the street.I received a very strong ""John Hughes vibe"" from this movie, and wonder if this influenced him in any way... there have been numerous ""last night together"" teen movies, but it seems like this was the one that really kicked off the trend.",American Graffiti
7,lee_eisenberg,"The Wolfman is everywhere, and so will this movie be forever. It really twists the night away!",10,26 October 2005,"In the movie that made him famous, George Lucas portrays several teenagers in Modesto, California, in 1962. Various things happen to them, and they see all sorts of things. Of course, the movie's other stars are the songs that make up the ultra-cool soundtrack. With a total of 45 classic tunes, this movie is a great time from beginning to end. You'll never forget the prank that Curt Henderson (Richard Dreyfuss) has to pull with the police car.Maybe some people might complain that the movie didn't really have much purpose, but that's too harsh; the point was for everyone to have a good time. And boy do we! With the soundtrack, plus great performances by Dreyfuss, Ron Howard (billed as ""Ronny"" for the last time), Charles Martin Smith, Paul LeMat, Cindy Williams, Candy Clark, Harrison Ford and Wolfman Jack, ""American Graffiti"" is a wonderful romp even today!",American Graffiti
8,jboothmillard,American Graffiti,7,31 January 2007,"Before his success with Star Wars, Oscar and Golden Globe nominated director George Lucas made this film based on his own experiences as a teenager, I remember watching it in college, but I'm glad I watched it again to get a better perspective, produced by Francis Ford Coppola. Basically, set on the last evening of summer vacation in 1962, in Modesto, California, a group of high school graduates and friends gather in the parking lot of Mel's Drive-In. Curt Henderson (Golden Globe nominated Richard Dreyfuss) and Steve Bolander (Ron Howard) are to travel ""Back East"" the following morning to start college. Curt has second thoughts about leaving Modesto. Steve gives his car to Terry ""The Toad"" Fields (The Untouchables' Charles Martin Smith) to look after until he returns. Laurie (BAFTA nominated Cindy Williams), Steve's girlfriend and Curt's sister, arrives. Steve suggests to Laurie that they see other people while he is away to ""strengthen"" their relationship. Though she does not appear upset, Laurie's emotions are affected during the many interactions through the night. Curt, Steve, and Laurie attend the back-to-high-school dance event. On the way, Curt sees a beautiful blonde woman (Suzanne Somers) driving a white Ford Thunderbird. She mouths the words ""I love you"" to Curt before driving away. Curt becomes desperate to find her. One of his friends tells him that she is the wife of a local jeweller, but Curt does not believe it. After leaving the dance, Curt is coerced by a group of greasers (""The Pharaohs"") into hooking a chain to a police car and ripping out its back axle. The Pharaohs tell Curt that ""The Blonde"" is a prostitute, which he does not believe. Curt drives to the radio station to ask disc jockey ""Wolfman Jack"" (himself) to read a message for her on the air. At the radio station, an employee tells Curt that Wolfman does not work there and that the shows are pre-recorded. The employee accepts the message and promises to try to have the Wolfman air it. As he is leaving, Curt sees the employee talking into the microphone hearing his voice he realises it is the Wolfman, who reads the message, asking ""The Blonde"" to meet Curt or call him on the pay phone at Mel's. Curt is awakened by the phone the next morning. ""The Blonde"" does not reveal her identity but tells Curt maybe they will meet that night. Curt replies that they probably will not because he is leaving town. Terry and John Milner (Golden Globe nominated Paul Le Mat), the drag-racing king, cruise the strip. Terry picks up flirtatious and rebellious Debbie (Oscar nominated Candy Clark). John inadvertently picks up annoying, precocious 12-year-old Carol (Mackenzie Phillips), who manipulates him into driving her around all night. Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford) is looking for John to challenge him to a race. Steve and Laurie continue to argue and make up through the evening. They finally split when Bob picks up Laurie. Bob finds John and goads him into racing. Many follow them to ""Paradise Road"" to watch. As John takes the lead, Bob's tire blows out, causing him to lose control, going into a ditch, rolling over, and the car catches fire. Steve and John leap out of their cars and rush to the wreck while Bob and Laurie crawl out and stagger away just before the vehicle explodes. Laurie grips Steve tightly and begs him not to leave her. He assures her that he will stay. At the airfield, Curt says goodbye to his parents, Laurie, Steve, John, and Terry. As the plane takes off, Curt gazes out the window and sees the white Thunderbird driving in parallel to his plane. An epilogue reveals that John was killed by a drunk driver in 1964, Terry was reported missing in action near An Loc in 1965, Steve is an insurance agent in Modesto and Curt is a writer in Canada. Also starring Bo Hopkins as Joe, Manuel Padilla Jr. As Carlos, Terence McGovern as Mr. Wolfe, and Kathleen Quinlan as Peg. Dreyfuss, Smith and Howard (before becoming a director) give good performances as the young wanting to find and impress the young females, and the brief appearances of Ford are interesting. You would be forgiven for thinking it is just teenagers driving around trying to pick up girls and go racing, but the soundtrack of 1960s hits more than makes up for this. Songs include: ""Rock Around the Clock"" by Bill Haley and the Comets, ""All Summer Long"" by The Beach Boys, ""Green Onions"" by Booker T. & the M. G.s, ""Runaway"" by Del Shannon, ""Sixteen Candles"" by The Crests, ""Johnny B. Goode"" by Chuck Berry, and ""That'll Be the Day"" by Buddy Holly. This film perfectly the 1960s nostalgia with its music, the cars, the fashion and the locations, moments of teens trying to get people to buy alcohol, causing police cars to crash and getting into tricky situations keep the pace going, the humour is light but reasonable, and it is good to experience an old-fashioned night on the town, a worthwhile coming-of-age drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Story and Screenplay Based on Factual Material or Material Not Previously Published or Produced, and Best Picture, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical/Comedy. It was number 43 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs, and it was number 77 on 100 Years, 100 Movies. Very good!",American Graffiti
9,ccthemovieman-1,"Bad Then, Even Worse Now",1,20 June 2007,"I know a lot of people loved this movie, right from the start when they first saw it in the early 1970s at the theaters. I hated it then, and I hated it 25 years later when I gave it another chance on VHS. It was even worse now because you added ""dated"" to this list of negative adjectives describing this movie. Stories about teenage jerks are not what I call entertaining. The only thing worse than the usual ""coming of age"" movie is one that involves the kids of the 1960s, the worst decade in American history.Ron Howard and Cindy Williams played pretty decent kids but nerd-looking Charles Martin Smith and friend Paul LeMat were super annoying. I didn't appreciate the language in here, either. I didn't expect The Mickey Mouse Club or Opie from Mayberry, but six usages of the Lord's name in vain in the first half hour along with a bunch of other profanities didn't turn me on to this ""comedy."" I also didn't get any laughs, either. Was this supposed to be a comedy? I hope not. Nothing much happens anyway, just the life of these dorks who drive around all night trying to impress bimbos. Wow, this is ""deep."".The only enjoyment I got out of this film was listening to the voice of ""Wolfman Jack,"" the legendary rock deejay.",American Graffiti
10,moonspinner55,Seems almost an accidental classic,9,7 October 2001,"I don't know if George Lucas really knew what he had in this picture--surely the screenplay seemed funny enough, and the thought of the cars and the period music was enticing--but did he really know these ""unknown"" actors would bring these characters to life? It seems almost a fluke, shot in 29 days and on a tight budget, but ""American Graffiti"" is a classic. It is perhaps pure nostalgia, mixing pathos and humor, sadness and craziness, hope and reflection in quiet little bursts of excitement. After cruising with Milner all night, teenage Carol hates to say goodbye but does, waving from her porch with the light on; Toad survives one bad accident after another, but his real moment is in hearing praise from his date (fantastic, husky-voiced Candy Clark, dolled up like a speeding Sandra Dee) just before she says good night; after chasing his dream date all night, Kurt (Richard Dreyfuss, green and anxious, and appealingly bemused) finally gets to talk to the stunning blonde wonder on the telephone, where she whispers a wrenching goodbye. The whole movie is steeped in reflection. It has great, great humor, yet it leaves one with a bittersweet melancholia. For yesterday is in the past, with our music, our memories and our hesitant farewells. ***1/2 from ****",American Graffiti
11,Quinoa1984,"Fellini's I Vitelloni transposed to rock n roll, teens, cruisers, and good vibes",10,13 August 2005,"They're each on the crossroads of High School into real life, either still deciding (Richard Dreyfuss' character Curt), or more just in the moment of their lives on a specific night following graduation (Ron Howard's Steve, Charles Martin Smith's 'Toad', Paul Le Mat's Milner). It's a night filled with riding in cars, meeting, wanting, or getting stuck with girls and women, racing, getting into mishaps, all the while having the unmistakable Wolfgang Jack on the radio playing the hits of the day. In fact, as the co-writer/director George Lucas has said, the film is more like a musical than a real drama/comedy, where the music informs the action. Scorsese was using this technique at the time as well, and it has become as heavily influential in the style of adolescent comedies and many other films as the special effects in Lucas following film, Star Wars. Sometimes the music makes a scene funnier, or more somber, or just adds that little bit of excitement, but more often than not it comments on the action, which helps far more than a musical score would've done for the material. If for nothing else, American Graffiti's musical compilation is a masterpiece unto itself.Lucas' second feature, American Graffiti- to date his one non-sci/fi &/or action film- keeps a cool, sometimes odd, but magnetic energy to it, even through some scenes that don't play great compared to others. Like with Lucas' inspiration for the film (aside from his own personal experiences and his own self), Federico Fellini's I Vitelloni, there is an original feel to the material, and particularly spontaneous in some of its humor, as well as the improvisational freedom (or at least feeling) from the actors. The main four characters, one a cool-dude (Milner), one a nerdy type (Toad), one the popular prom king (Steve), and another the average Joe of high school (Curt), each go through their own cycles of discovery on this night, and Lucas cuts their stories together wonderfully, never keeping the interest far off from the last story. It is a film of its time and a lot more for the generation of its time, and the humor shouldn't all work (I found myself laughing much more than I expected)- but it is on the money for most of it. The female performances s well, are memorable, and bring out some of the best laughs aside from some of the more uncomfortable or surprising bits; Toad wouldn't be as interesting or funny without the big blonde by his side all night, or the younger girl with Milner - much of the best awkward/genuine comedy comes from them. A lot of it is sarcastic, witty, and wild in its outlook, but there is also the tender, more emotional side to it all (much as would be in the Star Wars films with the comic relief). It's a well-rounded effort, and a small classic in the realm of 70's breakthrough cinema.",American Graffiti
12,sunwarrior13,A Classic Film About Teenagers During The 60's,10,19 May 2014,"American Graffiti is a film about a series of stories about a group of teenagers and their adventures one night that includes themes such as change,loss of innocence and the culture of the United States back in the 60's.It has an ensemble cast the includes Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, Paul Le Mat, Harrison Ford, Charles Martin Smith, Cindy Williams, Candy Clark and Mackenzie Phillips.It was co-written and directed by George Lucas,a legendary director known for Star Wars.Set in 1962 Modesto, California,the story is about a different group of teenagers that wanted to experience fun in the last night of summer before they go to college.They include Steve and Curt, college-bound students with mixed feelings about leaving their family at home;a nerd named Terry,who manages a dream date with a blonde named Debbie;John,a drag racer who wonders how much longer he can stay champion and how he got stuck with young 13-year-old Carol in his deuce coupe. When the D. J. started playing different rock and roll songs on radio all night long,the interplay of different stories begin.Steve ponders a future with girlfriend Laurie and Curt chases a mystery blonde.Meanwhile,Terry tries to act cool to impress a beautiful blonde.Then,Paul prepares for a race against Bob Falfa while stuck with Carol in his car.All of them prepare for a future that awaits them as the night goes by.This film definitely provides bittersweet moments for people who were young during the 1960's.It will definitely provide nostalgic moments for people born during the era of the setting of the screenplay.We also get to witness how the young Americans dealt with the different issues they faced such as loss of innocence,change,college education,dating and the influence of rock and roll music.Aside from that,we also get to witness people who participated in it that had successful careers later after the film was released such as Harrison Ford and George Lucas.Finally,its method of narrative of an interplay of different stories and youth-oriented themes that it presents provided a hallmark for similar films that were released years after.Despite the fact that I am aware that film may not hold up to the present time and may not be even appreciated by young people of today,I still believe that one who wants to see good movie will not be disappointed with this one as it accurately depicted what it is like to be a young American during that time and the method of narrative of different stories that it contains which was considered alternative during its time is comparable to similar films that were released today.These reasons alone makes American Graffiti a classic!!",American Graffiti
13,Hey_Sweden,What a night.,8,25 July 2020,"Over the years, filmmaker George Lucas became so synonymous with the Star Wars brand, that it seems fairly easy to forget that he'd already broken big in an impressive way with this memorable bit of nostalgia. Certainly anybody who lived through the summer of 1962 would find much to enjoy here, with its depictions of carefree young folk, who are uneasy about the future and are content to live in the moment. The visuals offer a steady parade of incredible, vintage cars and the soundtrack is full to the brim with pop hits of the era.The main through-line is that Curt (Richard Dreyfuss, in a star-making performance) is a recent high school graduate who is supposed to get on a plane and head East for further education. But he's not so sure he wants to do it. But during one eventful night, he will end up being ""recruited"" by a gang called the Pharaohs. Other sub plots include the towns' best racer (Paul Le Mat) being challenged by a cocky stranger (Harrison Ford), Curts' friend Steve (Ron Howard) going through a rough patch with his girlfriend (Cindy Williams), and the misadventures of the nerdy Terry the Toad (Charles Martin Smith), intent on impressing his date for the night (a dolled-up Candy Clark, in an adorable, Oscar-nominated performance).Legendary DJ Wolfman Jack adds to the soundtrack with his inimitable presence, and even appears on screen briefly. But the main reason that ""American Graffiti"" has stuck with so many of us for so long is the assemblage of acting talent, on the cusp of stardom here. A large number of known actors and otherwise familiar faces have roles big and small, with Dreyfuss anchoring the whole thing with his ingratiating performance. He's spotted a hot blonde (Suzanne Somers) driving a white T-Bird, and instantly become smitten.While ultimately bittersweet, ""American Graffiti"" is quite fun while it lasts, delivering many moments both humorous and poignant. The drag race finale, taking place at dawn, is the perfect capper on the whole thing.Written by Lucas, in collaboration with his friends Gloria Katz & Willard Huyck, and produced by Francis Ford Coppola, this really is a gem. Considering the fact that it was filmed rather fast and cheap, it packs quite a bit of enduring entertainment value into its 113-minutes running time.Eight out of 10.",American Graffiti
14,preppy-3,"""Where were you in '62?"" (Original ad)",7,28 November 2000,"Nostalgic look at one night/morning of a small California town and some of its teenagers. Story-wise this is nothing new--all the stereotypes are in place--the loving/bickering couple (Ron Howard and Cindy Williams); the rebel (Paul Le Mal) stuck with a 13 year old (Mackenzie Phuillips); the nerd (Charles Martin Smith) having a disastrous date with a blonde (Candy Clark); the hood (Bo Hopkins) showing the good boy (Richard Dreyfuss) a night out and Harrison Ford and Suzanne Somers in small parts. What makes this movie better than average is the great direction by George Lucas--he fills the Cinemascope screen masterfully; the non-stop soundtrack of 50s/60s hits; a great script and the cast of then-unknowns. It's incredible to see some of these actors so young (especially Ford and Dreyfuss) and full of life. Without this cast, this movie would probably have long-since been forgotten.So, no great shakes, but very sweet and nostalgic with some good acting. Worth catching.

Great performances from a then-unknown cast. Many of these unknown actors are now very well known: Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, Harrison Ford.Superb soundtrack. The 50s music adds a lot to the nostalgia and general feel of the movie.Solid direction from George Lucas. Yeah, who knew that he used to make dramas?

17,Boba_Fett1138,Great movie celebrating the '60's.,8,24 November 2006,"Man, George Lucas must have really love the '60's! This entire movie is an nostalgic trip and homage to the charismatic '60's. I mean, if you want to see how life of the American youth in the '60's was like, you should really watch this movie.The movie its story follows a group of friends that spend their last night together in town as high school graduations. After this all their lives will change and they will each head into different directions with their lives. For the last time they do want they want and simply enjoy their youth and the innocence of it. The movie has multiple story lines as it follows multiple individual characters during that one night. Every character experience something different and also learn some important life lessons in the progress. It makes the story well written and developed and all of the characters likable and interesting, although they are very stereotypical. It also of course helps the movie that they are being played by some great actors.The movie features lots of actors that at the time were still very young but now are very 'big'. Ron Howard, Richard Dreyfuss and Charles Martin Smith but also Harrison Ford in a small but very cool and likable role. A kind of role you wouldn't expect of him now days. Also look out for Kathleen Quinlan and Joe Spano in some small roles. So real great casting in this one! Every actor delivers a very realistic and likable performance.The movie features lots of stereotypical nostalgic '60's elements, such as drive-ins, cruising the strip, drag races etc. The movie is good looking with some nice looking cars and production design. It really helps to set the right mood for the time period the movie is set in. Also of course the very present musical-score consisting entirely out of memorable rock 'n' roll hits of the era helps to give you a real '60's' feeling, even if you weren't even born at that time (such as myself by the way).The movie is a great mix of nostalgic '60's elements and 'coming of age' story lines. It makes ""American Graffiti"" an unique and pleasant viewing experience.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",American Graffiti

American Graffiti ranks right up there with the ones I've seen, but they're all good. It is a top quality list. Apparently if you use ""American"" in your title it has to pass a more rigorous test of approval.American Graffiti is a throwback and it hits a little close to home for me. No, I can't relate to life in the early 60's with hot rods and cruisin' one bit but I am a little familiar with Modesto, California. I'll tell you what, if it was ever more than a dusty agricultural town then it's been downhill ever since. Maybe they can do an American Graffiti three to help that place out.",American Graffiti
20,evanston_dad,Movie's Appeal Is Lost on Me,6,8 June 2007,"Maybe I'm just not the right age to fully appreciate the nostalgic tug of this film, but I've never warmed to the charms of ""American Graffiti."" I usually like movies with loose, improvisational styles, which ""Graffiti"" certainly has. But here it feels more like pointless meandering than it does hip improvisation. The film stars a number of actors whose faces would become familiar but who were as yet unknown: Ron Howard, Richard Dreyfuss, Harrison Ford, Cindy Williams, and notably Mackenzie Phillips, who gives the funniest and most outrageous performance of the group. Fans of 1960s music and hot rods will also get a kick out of the soundtrack and the souped up cars these kids cruise around in, whiling away the hours before life -- and particularly the Vietnam War -- takes them in separate directions.Many lament the fact that George Lucas went on to make the ""Star Wars"" series when he could have instead made more films like this. I don't know. I for one enjoyed ""Star Wars"" a hell of a lot more.Grade: B",American Graffiti

22,Wuchakk,"Great cars & music from the late 50s/early 60s, but boring non-story & script",5,31 March 2017,"Released in 1973 and directed/written by George Lucas, ""American Graffiti"" is a teen drama taking place in a Bay area town in California one night at the end of the summer of '62. The youths drive the strip, seek romance, drink, cause innocent havoc and reflect on their futures. As the inspiration of the popular Happy Days, I was expecting a great movie, but it's not. Sure, the old cars and late 50s/early 60's rock 'n' roll are great, as are some of the cast, but the story & writing are seriously dull. ""Dazed and Confused"" (1993) had a similar theme, but the events in that film take place in 1976 and the movie's all-around superior (it's incredible how American culture radically changed in a mere 14 years). Ron Howard is perfect as the protagonist for this sort of story, as shown in Happy Days, but I didn't care a wit about his character's relationship with his girlfriend (Cindy Williams) and whether or not they stayed together as Steve (Howard) readied himself for college. Nor did I buy the idea that Debbie would be into Terry at the end (Candy Clark & Charles Martin Smith) or that Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) would fall hopelessly in love with some older blond he meets for 5 seconds on the strip. Paul Le Mat plays the best character, the hot roddin' John, and I liked how his relationship with the pubescent Carol (Mackenzie Phillips) evolves over the course of the evening but their bickering is annoying. Interestingly, a young Harrison Ford appears as John's racing rival and there's an effective race sequence at the end. Bo Hopkins is notable as the leader of the Pharaohs gang where Manuel Padilla Jr & Beau Gentry play subordinates; they, more or less, take Curt hostage. Unfortunately, there are only a couple of genuinely alluring females and they're decidedly side characters (e.g. Jana Bellan). So I enjoyed the setting, the cars, the music and some of the cast, but virtually none of the subplots interested me. The writing's unengaging. Combine virtually any four Happy Days episodes and they're vastly more entertaining story-wise than this ridiculously overrated flick. Despite my criticisms, the film was a hit and Lucas used his newfound clout to forge 1977's blockbuster ""Star Wars."" The movie runs 112 minutes and was shot in the bay area of Northern California (Petaluma, San Rafael, Mill Valley, Pinole, Concord, Larkspur, SF and Berkeley). ADDITIONAL WRITERS: Gloria Katz & Willard Huyck. Wolfman Jack is heard on the radio throughout and even appears at the end. GRADE: C",American Graffiti
23,The_Void,A true American classic,8,22 May 2005,"As many people know, George Lucas is most famous for the fact that he wrote a certain series of fantasy films. Most of those films certainly were a great achievement, but one thing that many Star Wars fans overlook is the other entries in Lucas' list of directorial credits; one of which is this film, American Graffiti. The movie tells the story of the last night in town for a bunch of school kids about to leave to go to college. Now, this might not seem like a great base for a classic movie to work from; and it isn't, it's the handling that makes it great. In spite of his latest batch of movies, Lucas has shown with this movie that he has the talent to create an innovative and groundbreaking movie in spite of the plot. It's this fact that made Star Wars work so well, and it's nice to see the same effort transplanted into an earlier film that doesn't have the special effects and grandiose that Star Wars had. The energy and vitality that Lucas gives his multiple stories makes for a great ride, and American Graffiti is a lot of fun throughout.The film is most notable for the way that it captures the American youth of the sixties. It benefits from a great soundtrack that adequately helps to achieve this, and includes the likes of Buddy Holly and The Beach Boys. The film takes place in one night, and makes use of a number of different characters and story lines; all of which are interesting and unique. A lot of which are also really funny, and this is where my favourite part of American Graffiti comes in. The film works because it's such a good time, and the way that Lucas shows us that ensures that we have just as good a time as the characters on screen are having. The events that befall the characters in the movie will no doubt touch a nerve with anyone that has gone through childhood - things such as splitting up with your girlfriend, to being forced into doing things that could get you into trouble...all the way to asking an adult to go into a store to buy alcohol for you are shown with great care, and show that Lucas obviously knew what he was doing when he took on this movie. On the whole...it's very good stuff indeed.",American Graffiti

Ron Howard would go on to Happy Days and a successful film directing career. He played Steve, the All American guy from high school. This is his last night before going to college. Steve's girlfriend, Laurie Henderson, is played by Cindy Williams who would later play Shirley Feeney on television. This film brought Harrison Ford out of acting retirement. Richard Dreyfuss played Curt Henderson, an ambitious graduate going to college on the East Coast. Curt is also Laurie's older brother. Suzanne Somers has a pivotal role. The film is about teens, cars, a drive in, and cruising in town. A lot happened on Curt's last night before going off to college. It has become a classic but I wished they told us about the female characters in the film. Can't forget Wolfman Jack, the radio DJ of the time.",American Graffiti

This film and 'Dazed and Confused' go over memorable High school events outside of school.  The script, probably, based on real life events; the film's events cut too close to be fiction, maybe a little Jazzed up, but stories passed down over time.

26,namashi_1,A Landmark!,10,21 July 2010,"George Lucas takes us back in time with his cult-classic 'American Graffiti'. Lucas, mostly remembered for making 'STAR WARS' and the legend of it... but believe me guys, Lucas has made some amazing stuff in here, that surely translates as one of the greatest films! 'American Graffiti' is a study of the cruising and rock and roll cultures popular among the Post-World War II baby boom generation. The film is a nostalgic portrait of teenage life in the early 1960s told in a series of vignettes, featuring a group of teenagers and their adventures in a single night in late August 1962. Lucas brings style, rock and roll, dances and an attitude in 'American Graffiti'.Some films don't bore and this is one of those rare gems. The screenplay is so perfect and inspiring, that each writer gets in the mood of holding a pen right-away. Lucas brings in 10-odd characters that are wonderfully marked, placed and executed. Lucas's direction is flawless, amongst the best I've ever seen! The Soundtrack is EPIC! You're back in time and you're loving it! Performance-Wise: Candy Clark steals the show in a role that earned her a Academy-Award nomination. She is fantastic. Richard Dreyfuss is terrific. Paul Le Mat is bombastic. Ron Howard is exceptional. Cindy Williams looks cute, and her performance is a topper as well. Harrison Ford leaves a mark. Charles Martin Smith stands out. Others are perfect.On the whole, One of the finest films ever! A LANDMARK! Mr.Lucas, thanks for taking me back in time! 60's, wow!",American Graffiti
27,Smells_Like_Cheese,What would you do on your last night with your friends?,7,12 August 2006,"That's pretty much what sums this movie up. Everyone is graduating and it's their last night together, and how they spend it turns up to be in pretty funny situations. There is what they might call a Revenge of the Nerds type of situation, a kid and a rebel hottie, a man finally getting a dangerous adventure, and a questioning relationship finally has closure.I can see where this movie had such impact back in the 70's, but to be honest, I wasn't that impressed. I think maybe I was expecting too much because of the fact that this movie is practically mentioned everything people bring up cinema of the 70's. Also, it was mentioned in a few of my film books and one of the funniest movies of all time.I would recommend this for movie buffs, just so they could say that they at least saw it, but honestly, I think it's lost some effect for this generations. But I would never diss this movie, just for the fact it had me on the floor sometimes in laughter, and that line ""Your car is uglier than I am!"". LOL! 7/10",American Graffiti
28,blanbrn,"Teen flick filled with cliques, fun, mischief, hormones, and street cruising it will take many back to the teenage years.",5,8 July 2007,"""American Graffiti"" now considered by many a classic, yet to me is nothing more than a fun teen flick about a group of high school students that tells a coming of age story. It will take many back and remind them of their teen years, as they see things in the film like making out in the backseat, drive ins, cruising the streets and talking to passengers from car windows. Good job by George Lucas to capture a unique take on high school teens during a summer night, really this was just a stepping stone before his big later blockbuster ""Star Wars"". The music played during this film helps carry it along as it sets the mood and tone so well of the 60's time period. The characters have traits of all typical high schoolers ranging from behavior types of nerds, brains, snobs, and jocks. This was some of the earliest work also for many future stars like Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, Cindy Williams and even Harrison Ford as a street racing cowboy. Also catch and listen to Wolfman Jack as a radio announcer during the film. To sum it up an okay teen flick that will have the viewer remembering their teenage years somewhat.",American Graffiti
29,DKosty123,"No Chewy, Blondes Are Not This Much Fun",10,21 August 2008,"George Lucas hit upon a classic theme, 1950's nostalgia in 1973. When folks wanted to forget about being a modern teen, getting drafted, and wanted mindless fun this movie did it. Lucas got this inspiration from his own teen years as he turned 16 in 1959. This meant that while he would later draw on Ben Hur for the Star Wars saga, he first achieved success here drawing on his earlier childhood.The brief introduction of Suzanne Summers & Harrison Ford in this movie were not noticed until years later. Wolfman Jack on the other hand got a great boost from this film and became an icon of his own. Ronnie Howard was already a big name from Andy Griffith. This movie would boost him into the Happy Days.This film is our look into the 1950's age that Lucas remembered oh so well. This film does it so well that you almost forget the 1960's ever happened & we all grew up. The sexual innuendo from this would carry on for Lucas. Chewy, get into there, I don't care how it smells. Just let me turn on that radio dial & spend another night with the Wolfman.",American Graffiti
30,Red-Barracuda,An impressive slice-of-life period piece from George Lucas,8,11 April 2017,"It's the summer 1962 in a small town in California and one evening we spend time following various teenagers on the brink of adulthood. There's a college-bound young guy with doubts if he wants to leave, there's a nerd who gets a date with a blonde fox, there's a drag racer who gets lumbered with a thirteen-year-old girl and all the while a DJ called Wolfman Jack plays music throughout the night on the local radio. There are street gangs with logo'd leather jackets, waitresses on roller-skates and continual car cruising. There's no real plot, it's all about a moment in time. When it was released in 1973 it told of a time a decade in the past but it truly seemed like an aeon away on account of the transition of the counter-cultural 60's when everything changed so dramatically and radically, meaning that the early 60's pre-Vietnam small town America seemed like an alien landscape but one with more innocence and clearly one that held much appeal in the cynical landscape of 70's America.Produced by Francis Ford Coppola, this was a breakthrough film for his friend George Lucas who directed it. It was more accessible than his previous left-field sci-fi movie THX1138 (1971) and it was the film he made before the ultimate blockbuster Star Wars (1977) which changed cinema forever. American Graffiti shows the capability of Lucas and proves he could make very human stories. It's not always the most engaging film due to its lack of plot, it works more as an atmospheric period piece, helped greatly by its rock-n-roll soundtrack which plays continually in the background. It's a coming-of-age teen movie and one that definitely is on the more intelligent side of the spectrum of that particular sub-genre.",American Graffiti
31,StrictlyConfidential,"I Was Bored Right From The Word ""GO!""",3,15 April 2020,"Hey, kids! - Let me tell you something - The only thing that this film's dreary story actually proved to me was to show me just how unbelievably boring it was to be a teen back in that particular era in pop-culture history.I think that anyone who offers praise to this major letdown has to be viewing it through the distorted haze of rose-colored glasses.Well - Hey! - What more can I say?",American Graffiti
32,ElMaruecan82,Lucas drives us back to the Oldies ;..,10,10 September 2012,"Where was I in 1962? Well, since Pop was only 7 and Mom only 3, I guess I wasn't alive enough to remember. Yet George Lucas' ""American Graffiti"" has this 'magical' quality, just like Woody Allen's ""Radio Days"": it made me feel nostalgic for a time I didn't belong to. Take Rob Reiner's ""Stand By Me"" for instance, because I could identify with the four kids, to a certain degree, the film created a feeling of 'déjà vu' echoing my own childhood memories and its male-bonding insouciance; while in ""American Graffiti"", I couldn't relate to the four guys but to the time they lived. George Lucas didn't make a nod to the innate innocence of his teenage days but an ode to the early 60's, what we label now as the 'oldies'. The tag line 'where were you in '62?' couldn't have been more explicit.And in one single night, ""American Graffiti"" encapsulates the whole juvenile lifestyle of 1962; juke-boxes, fast-foods, cars, cruising, the tone is set right in the beginning with the classic sound of Bill Haley's ""Rock Around the Clock"", the first of a series of an unforgettable soundtrack. Indeed, every scene is accompanied with a defining song of that era ""Runaway"", ""You're 16"", ""Only You"", ""Little Darlin', whatever fits the mood. In fact, what makes ""American Graffiti"" a kind of a milestone in filmmaking is in the way it redefined the use of music for atmospheric purposes. By depicting to the core what the 60's musically meant, before ""Forrest Gump"" or ""Goodfellas"", George Lucas created what would become a trademark in 'period' films. Music was everywhere, youth could fantasize on a voice rather than a sex symbol, those were the radio days, those were the cars' days.""American Graffiti"" is also remembered as a car-themed film, car as less than a vehicle than a social instrument. Young people back then had no other alternatives than going out and discovering the wonders of life only through experience because staying at home was a self-condemnation to a dull nothingness. Cars were the Freudian materialization of freedom level. A man was independent with a car; it enabled him to take a girl, because there was the possibility to drive her home then, and in-between, if he was lucky, to have some intimacy. Charles Martin Smith as the insecure Terry the Toad whose status changes as soon as Steven (Ron Howard) lends him his car, he gets the pretty Debbie (Oscar-nominated Candy Clark) in and is forced to keep on trying to impress her. John Milner (Paul Le Mat) is more of a bad-boy type and his car is the incarnation of his male power, like a complement of his tumultuous personality.Lucas used an interesting word to describe ""American Graffiti"": anthropological, the film enlightens us about the days' habits and codes, notably how cars were used for social purposes. Cruising can even be compared with today's surfing on the web, we chat on Facebook or visit websites while people were just driving in the neighborhood, to meet each other, or with no other purpose than having a good time, meeting someone, or just aimlessly driving. In a way, cruising defined the youth's state of mind, a transitional moment where many options converge and any choice can be crucial. Steven and Curt (Richard Dreyfus) incarnate these phases. Steven thinks about leaving but is not quite sure about letting his girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams) alone, while Curt (Richard Dreyfus), less charismatic and adventurous, hasn't made up his mind yet, his journey embodies the coming-of-age feeling of the film.And all these characters ring true despite the overall comedic tone, a credit to the writing. ""American Graffiti"" is one of these gems like only the 70's and the New Hollywood generation could have made, it's a character study combined with a social commentary. The character is the baby boom youth, the last generation who grew up with the post-war prosperity, who danced to sweet ballads and rock and roll when it was still a continuation of good old rhythm and blues and the commentary is that this era is over. The fact that the film takes place in 1962 takes all its significance when you know what happens in 1963. Remembering the 60's without thinking of Kennedy's Assassination or the Vietnam War is as impossible as remembering the last decade without September 11th. After 1962, America lost her virginity, the Beatles and the Rolling Stones drowned the American charts, John Milner complained about the Beach Boys wave, English Pop was a tsunami. Girl's dresses would get shorter and shorter making the 50's hottest cheerleader as sensual as a nun. 1963 would be this big leap in the 'sex, drugs and rock'n'roll' mentality. And I guess in the 70's, in the middle of an oil-crisis, where the world was struck by unemployment, where the hedonistic dream of the hippie counterculture vanished from the spirits, people like George Lucas started to feel nostalgic toward these days of lost innocence, and decided to make a film that would sound like both a celebration and a eulogy to a lost era. It's a celebration through the nostalgia-inducing exhalation of cars, colors, a gallery of colorful characters (including a young Harrison Ford) and the kaleidoscope of the greatest hit songs, and a eulogy when it ends with the fate of the four guys, proving that despite the relative innocence of the script, the film was much more mature than that. ""American Graffiti"" is warm and fuzzy but there is an inner sadness lying beneath and elevating it to one of the best of the New Hollywood era, and of American cinema in general. ""American Graffiti"" resonates in the heart like a cinematic ""American Pie"", I'm talking of Don McLean's 1972 tribute to the same era.",American Graffiti
33,MOscarbradley,Still the best 'teen' movie ever made.,10,8 June 2020,"Still probably the greatest 'teen' movie ever made, ""American Graffiti"" introduced two great new talents to the world. This was director George Lucas' sophomore film and it had a freshness and a 'look' that took the breath away and still does. On the strength of this, (and his later ""Star Wars""), you might have thought that Lucas would go down as one of best directors the movies had ever seen and it introduced an extraordinarily talented new 'kid' called Richard Dreyfuss. Although Dreyfuss had been working since 1964 was 26 when he made ""American Graffiti"" he had no problem passing for 17. His is a great performance in a cast full of extraordinary performances from people mostly new to the movies. Former child actor Ron Howard was the best known; others included Charlie Martin Smith, Cindy Williams, Paul Le Mat, Candy Clark, (Oscar nominated), a young Mackenzie Phillips and a totally unknown actor called Harrison Ford.The entire action takes place over the course of one night as a high school class breaks up for the last time. That's about as deep as it gets but seldom has the talk of a bunch of high school kids sounded as interesting or indeed as profound.

They were all unknown at the time but this movie jumpstarted the careers of Harrison Ford, Ron Howard, and Richard Dreyfuss.As I stated before, this movie is somewhat nostalgic to me. I saw this with my parents and they saw it when it came back out in 1973. This film also has a killer soundtrack.

The biggest issue is that there is simply no story whatsoever, we are just watching a gang of teenagers driving around in cars and listening to classic music for ninety minutes. As well at that, the cast are extremely lacking in chemistry, there is no sense that they are truly friends with one another and it really takes you out of the movie because of the fact that a convincing friendship is the most vital part of a film like this. It's poorly directed and edited, George Lucas made this because it was cheap and would give him money to create a more expensive production, which went on to be Star Wars, and a lack of passion in bringing this to life is highly evident. Poor cast, writing and short on laughs, American Graffiti is simply not worth the watch.

37,A_Different_Drummer,"If this film does not define a ""10"" then nothing does..",10,6 December 2013,"It is possible I have seen this film beginning to end over 10 times. As far as I can tell, it is perfect. When I watch it I lose all sense of time. It is a textbook study in the importance of character relationships in a story, and the corresponding resonance with the viewer, over brain-dead action and flash-bangs. I am aware there are arguments that you need to be a child of the era to appreciate this film. It is a great argument, as arguments go, but essentially flawed. Every generation understands the essential themes of growing up, wanting to be liked for who you are, going to war, being in a relationship where you are either dominant or submissive to the other, feeling like you want to do something crazy but not get caught, and, at the core, just plain having fun. Ron Howard was never better. Suzanne Summers, before she became an icon, was perfectly cast as the mystery woman. MacKenzie Phllips was never younger or more sassy. If you look closely, there is even a prototype here for the ""Fonz"" before that character became a TV hit. The solo by Wolfman Jack as someone who is not in real life what he appears to be ""electronically"" is brilliantly conceived. In fact, the heck with it, the entire film is brilliant, the impact has never been repeated by any other film, not even the sequel, and if this is not a true ""10"" then ... to quote one of my favorite Marvel characters, paint me blue... and call me Cupid.",American Graffiti

Its 1962 and they are on the verge of high school graduation. Therefore, they want to ""cruise"" the strip one more time with two other friends, John (Paul Le Mat), the fastest dude with a souped-up car, and Terry (Charles Martin Smith), the clumsy dweeb with a heart of gold. But, naturally there are underlying issues. Steve and has been fighting a lot with his girlfriend (Cindy Williams), for she doesn't want Steve to go to college on the east coast with her brother Curt. As a junior, she worries this move will break them up forever and, after all, she is a head cheerleader to Steve's class president gig. Curt, too, feels something is missing and when he spies a beautiful unknown blonde (Suzanne Somers) on the strip, he decides to spend the night chasing her. John is a powderkeg of worry as well, since he knows he can't be king of the cruise forever and he has no great future aspirations or talents. Lastly, Terry is just finally trying to get a gal to look his way and when he meets a lovely platinum gal (Candy Clark) he thinks his ship has come in. During the course of the night, John gets stuck with a very young teen passenger, Carol (Mackenzie Phillips), Curt gets sidetracked with a local gang, Steve fights with his gal, resulting in her riding around with a handsome new guy (Harrison Ford), while Terry has trouble buying booze for his new love interest. Is this going to be a memorable last night? You bet! This film, a first big winner for George Lucas, is spot-on in capturing the essence of life for a 1962 American teenager. Just before the Vietnam war sobered everyone down, life was a carefree journey of cruising and hanging-out. Wait, really? No, maybe not, for despite the joy and laughs in this adventure, there is an undercurrent of insecurity, jealousy, and rivalry that can and does exist anytime, anywhere. The young stars, all of whom are terrific, got there first big breaks in this one. Dreyfuss, Howard (well, he was already famous as Opie), Williams, Smith, LeMat, Clark, Somers and especially Phillips and Ford, do memorable work and moved on to more Hollywood glory. As for the sets, costumes, camera work, script, and direction, it would be difficult to locate any film that has all of its elements working together for such a whopping success. If you have been doing the Rip Van Winkle dance for 40 years, wake up and get this very funny, very touching, very winning flick without delay.",American Graffiti
40,Bored_Dragon,Isn't it a bit overrated ?!,7,12 October 2017,"This American classic from 1973. was nominated for 5 Oscars and it's considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time and ultimate teenage movie. OK, it's written and directed by Lucas, produced by Coppola and cast, including legends like Richard Dreyfuss and Harrison Ford, is excellent. Parade of awesome cars from 50's and 60's, cute girls and non-stop rock'n'roll guarantee pleasure, but no matter how much I like it I really do not see what makes this movie so great to be as high as top 100 of all time.

41,The-Sarkologist,Pretty much Happy Days by George Lucas,8,23 September 2011,"Well, I guess I was wrong when I said that the only movie George Lucas made was Star Wars. I know that he has made at least two other movies, this and THX 1138. American Graffiti is about the final day of summer in a small, unnamed American Town. It is unnamed because is probably reflects that this could be any town in America. The opening of the movie looked a lot like Happy Days, though this image quickly disappears as the movie continues. American Graffiti is based about a group of teenagers, two who are preparing to go to college in the morning. Another has been given a car by his best friend to look after while he is in college, and one who cruises the streets to the town looking for people to race. The night life of this town reminds me vaguely of Port Pirie (a town about three hours drive North of Adelaide). Every Friday and Saturday nights the teenagers jump into the car and drive up and down main street, and have earned the name Mainies. The movie is set in the 60's and is supposed to be a retrospect of this era. I don't think it is really, rather it deals with the personalities of the people and their journey to adulthood. Everybody in the movie experiences a change in their character and come out of the night different than when they entered. Steven (Ron Howard) is confident that he will go to college and dumps his long time girlfriend because of it. Unfortunately this backlashes against him as he realises that he cannot simply let go of her. He spends the night chasing her and trying to repair the damage, yet his arrogance always overwhelms him and destroys the relationship even further. The biggest event is when he watches the race where the car she is in goes off of the road and rolls. Steve suddenly realises how delicate life really is and that he simply cannot let go of her that easily. It is because of this that he decides to remain in the town for a year. What I liked about Steve is that it was a complete opposite of Richie Cuningham, the character that Ron Howard is famous for. When I first saw the character I thought that it would be a clone of Richie, but he is not. Richie was a nerd in happy days whereas Steve is the big man around town. People generally didn't respect Richie whereas people respected Steve. Most importantly Steve was an arrogant person demanding his girlfriend's loyalty and respect, while I can not remember Richie Cuningham being arrogant. Then there is the hoon. He begins driving around the town looking to pick up a girl. When he does it lands up that she is very young. She wants excitement, he simply wants her out of the car, yet every time he gets rid of her he suddenly realises that he simply can't let her go. It is not because he is in love with her, but rather he is responsible for her. Thus it goes from looking for a way to dump her to looking for a way to get her home. This guy, who has never shown an ounce of responsibility in his life, is suddenly learning that he has to be responsible. The change in him is much different to that of Steve because it is slower, but we see it by the end of the movie. At the start he is convinced that he is the fastest driver in the valley, but by the end he is beginning to have doubts. Even though he won the race, it is because the other car flipped, not because he was any good. He isn't happy that he won, but rather he is looking for away out. The car flipping hurt him as well because it revealed his irresponsibility to him. Then there was Steve's best friend. He is also going to college, but he is having doubts. He doesn't really want to leave the town. He has roots in the town and he wants to remain, but the pressure is for him to leave. What roots he has are shallow. He does not have a girlfriend and spends much of the movie wondering around by himself looking for a phantom woman. He gets involved in a gang and is accepted by them, but he does not want to tie himself down to them. He wants the lady because she is the most beautiful thing in the world, but he can never find anything out about her. She is a myth. She speaks to him at the end of the film over the telephone, but he cannot tie her down to anything. Instead she represents the truth behind his character. He is as much of a drifter as her, he does not want to tie himself down to anything, but rather have options open. Even though he doesn't really want to go, he tells everybody that he probably is, and thus in the end goes. My problem with the movie was the continuity errors, and there was a big one. The scenes seemed to switch from night to day and thus you were never sure of what time it was. At one time, there was a lot of light in the country and I thought it was dawn, but then it switched back to the town and it was night. I would expect that a director like George Lucas would pick up something like that. Still, the movie ran quite smoothly otherwise.",American Graffiti
42,sol-,My brief review of the film,4,5 July 2005,"An atmosphere of the 1960s attitudes and values is set up well in this film, and there are some themes of maturity at hand, but otherwise there is little to compliment, unless one was there and can comment on nostalgic value. For a comedy, it is not very funny, nor amusing, with a few gags but no real jokes. For a drama, it is all a bit too disjointed to cut deep, with many different story-lines all over the place. All in all, the film is merely just a display of different events showing teenage angst and spirit, as opposed to a film that tells a solid story. Dreyfuss is fairly good, and it is satisfactory viewing, but it does not come recommended.",American Graffiti
43,eddie_baggins,A lovingly crafted throwback to a time gone by and growing up,9,7 April 2020,"While he will forever be known for the man that gave the universe Star Wars, one of beloved filmmaker George Lucas's greatest feats behind the camera remains a seemingly unassuming tale of teenagers learning to cope with their quickly appearing adult lives in the 1973 classic American Graffiti.On surface level a film about nothing more than a bunch of typical teenage boys spending one last night out in their small town as their summer break of 1962 comes to a close and their new college lives are set to begin, Graffiti is actually an ageless examination of a time of our lives that we will never forget, where friendships, romances and decisions we make set us on a course to shape the rest of our lives.Featuring a recognisable cast of fresh faced stars that includes Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard and Harrison Ford, this Oscar nominated and box office smash, that was supported by esteemed director Francis Ford Coppola is a time capsule of a time gone by as an array of classic tunes introduced by the real Wolfman Jack play out around a townscape filled with burger shop drive ins, supped-up rides and colourful fashion.There's no real narrative driver as such, as Dreyfuss's Curt searches for a girl of his dreams that his seen on the strip, Howard's Steve has relationship drama's with his long-term girlfriend Laurie, Paul Le Mat's John gets stuck chaperoning the much younger Carol around town and Charles Martin Smith's Terry tries to score booze and score with Candy Clark's Debbie of whom he has just met.The joy of Graffiti and Lucas's sentimental examination of this time is evident in every frame of the film that is joyfully played out by its enthusiastic cast and while a more centralized plot driver wouldn't have hurt the film, the dreamlike and breezy nature of the plot is a charming component of the film in its own right and no doubt an inspiration for such films as Dazed and Confused and other such coming of age slice of life tales.When you watch Graffiti in today's climate there's also a certain level of disappointment that Lucas didn't tap into more character driven and genuinely funny outings across his career, that has been overshadowed by his divisive work in the sci-fi space, it shows a whole different side to the bearded filmmaker and one that is a perfect example of the nuance and soul that exists within an imaginary artist that is just as at home with home truths as he is with light sabers and masked villains.Final Say -A glorious ode to a simpler time where cruising in your car and wondering what to order from the local drive in joint was about as hard as life got, American Graffiti is charming ride through the past that will resonate with anyone that has maneuvered through their teenage years into the great unknown we call adulthood.4 1/2 Cherry Cokes out of 5",American Graffiti

Here, the movie is really about driving cool in the city after the sunset. This particular hobby of 60s American teens is well directed by Lucas, all the more than the cars were beautiful and filled with great rock song (which is not more the case actually). According to him, he was the first director to tell parallel stories about a multiple cast. I can't verify his statement but i can say that his choices of characters are rather uneven : Toad have the best interesting part with a delicious date and funny adventures. John comes close but mainly because he met original sidekicks : Carol and Harrison whose character acts like Han Solo on earth ! On the opposite, the adventures of Curt and Ron Howard are rather dull. In addition, i had the memory of the movie being bright, colorful and indeed shining like a jukebox whereas the DVD version i watched was rather dark and the colors very pale. But at the end, filling all the stories in one night in one little town is close to classic drama and the thematic of leaving homes and becoming an adult are rather interesting interesting and well done as well.",American Graffiti

47,SAMTHEBESTEST,An amusing graffiti of teenage night out.,7,29 November 2020,"American Graffiti (1973) :
Brief Review -An amusing graffiti of teenage night out. George Lucas known mostly for Sci fi themes tried his hands in teenage drama with the second film of his career which became a nostalgia and sensation for the entire teen generation of that time. This is how one can define American Graffiti in educational language. The film is about High school lads and their night out before the day when two of them were supposed leave the town. From the start to the end the film is full of fun, dance, charm, romance, flirt and all the hideous activities teens love to do. No moment goes in vain while setting up things and so the grip is never left lose. This engagement is turned into an entertaining ride with funky comedy. The biggest reason behind the commercial success and cultural popularity of this is nothing else but the Entertainment provided in most simple way. No hard hitting stuff, no lifelong lectures, no heavyweight thoughts just simple night out fun and American Griffiti end up as a Well Made Film. The cast is charming i mean everyone including all hot and cold characters whom you can connect quickly just after first two or three scenes. It is not a kids material because of slight addition of sexual content but then there is one character made for those underage audience of a girl who wants to hang out but is not eligible because she's underage. And she is a solid wood. I don't know how Lucas made this cast look younger than what they are but it's pure amusement seeing these all actors in young roles. American Graffiti may not be that film which falls in content oriented zone but it is definitely a satisfying product considering the limit of this genre. Among all the teenage dramas I have seen till the date, American Griffiti is surely one of the finest entertainer among them. This is George Lucas's identity before Star Wars (1977) phenomena.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest",American Graffiti
48,matthewssilverhammer,As Familiar and Relatable As Ever,8,31 August 2018,"Most of us remember our teen years with some form of longing; the freedom, the friendships, the adventure. However, many of us forget how difficult it was. Not just the heartbreak, aimlessness, put-upon responsibility and endless levels of adult authority; we tend to forget hard it was to be so certain about everything yet so often wrong. Lucas's 45-year-old classic captures this frustration perfectly; not with a critical, ""you-darn-kids!"" eye, but with humorous sympathy. No matter what your generation, American Graffiti is YOUR American teendom; fearful bravado, naïve excitement, and all.
American Graffiti is essentially an anthology film, covering the last night of summer for a group of recently-graduated small-town-American teens in 1962. Lucas displays such caring control of his characters, with a script bursting with as much honesty and life as hormones from an 18-year-old. The dialogue is timelessly wonderful, often hilarious, and always trusting that the audience will keep up with its recognizable usage and references without obnoxious hand-holding. And the up-and-coming cast is bright-eyed and stellar, with Dreyfuss's every-teen and Phillip's spunky tween brat leading the pack.
Perhaps its biggest impact is the invention of nostalgia culture, specifically among teens. Sure, by its very nature, some of the references, styles and societal norms are unintentionally dated (ogling of women, faking sexual harassment, teacher-student relations). However, nearly as often, its completely intentional. The use of golden oldies radio to score the evenings frivolities, including the use of DJ and rock-and-roll guru Wolfman Jack, is used for more than cheap recognition. American Graffiti soars above most ""hey-remember-this?"" pop culture by making its nostalgia dressing, not the purpose, and letting the universal truths of adolescence shine brighter.",American Graffiti

50,GOWBTW,A great movie dealing with nostalgia!,10,15 July 2006,"Ah yes the 60's, a great time to be free. In California, buddies from high school share their last times together before college get to enjoy fun. Even though my mom was around that time, she would have her perspective view of that time. ""American Graffiti"", has got a lot of nostalgic momentum which makes it very watchable. The music, the cars, the juvenile quips, are all in this fine movie Francis Ford Coppola made. There's a lot of stars of tomorrow there. Ron Howard, fresh out of ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and way before ""Happy Days"". Cindy Williams before ""Lavern & Shirley"" Harrison Ford as the upstart driver. Richard Dreyfuss as Curt who's on the hunt for that mysterious blonde. And Mackenzie Phillips way before ""One Day at a Time"". These and other stars really made the movie magic work. And as for George Lucas, he is the man all the way. I liked every scene the movie has. And John Miner(Paul Le Mat) has to ride around town with Carol(Philips). He is ""The King of the Road"" until Bob Falfa(Ford) taunted him to the race. John did win the race via blowout. It's a shame that he lost his life to a drunk driver. At least Carol got a piece of his car to remember him by. And it wouldn't be ""American Graffiti"" if it wasn't for DJ Wolfman Jack(1939-95). His voice will live on forever! I liked the part after Carol got pelted by the water balloon, John and Carol get their revenge big time when Carol creams the windows as John take out the tires. The 60's are a crazy time, but just like any other decade life moves on. A very fine performance for everyone, this movie is a must! 5 stars!",American Graffiti
51,freemantle_uk,"An enjoyable, intention comedy by George Lucas",8,25 April 2011,"George Lucas is most famous for making the Star Wars trilogies and producing the Indiana Jones series. But between his first sci-fi film THX-1138 and his big hit Star Wars, Lucas made a comedy film (excluding the Star Wars prequel), American Graffiti which was nominated for a number of Academy Awards.Set in the early 60s, American Graffiti tells the story of four friends before they go their separate ways on summer night. They is Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) who is having doubts about going to university on the other side of the country who is searching for a blond beauty driving a white Thunderbird and ends up getting mixed up with some greasers. Steve (Ron Howard) is also going to university and in the middle of an on-off relationship with his girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams), starting with him breaking up with her at the start of the film. John (Paul Le Mat) is a hot-rod racer who accident picks up a young girl, Carol (Mackenzie Phillips) and ends up getting challenged by a rival racer (Harrison Ford). And finally there is Terry the Toad (Charles Martin Smith), who is given a car by Steve and ends up trying to impress a attractive young woman, Debbie (Candy Clark), simply by lying about everything about himself.American Graffiti is considered one of the great car films, showing iconic classic cars in all their glory. There is also a really good soundtrack of late 50s and 60s song, fitting for the film.It is a film that shows an idealistic version of the 60s, set in a white, wealthy, middle-class small town where teenagers have nice expensive cars, have no really issues and any delinquency they get up to is minor and tame. The late 50s and 60s was a period of post war affluent in America: people were becoming wealthier and having more disposable cash. It was also a period where teenager culture grew and divided childhood and adulthood.The film itself is really a series of a events rather then a narrative structure, they is no real aim in the film. Curt is possibly the closest thing we got to a main character who is has a real decision either go to university on the other side of America or stay, be safe and find a girl. Steve is a jerk, he breaks up with his girlfriend because he wants to screw around at university and then in a later scene pressures her into having sex. John is your typical bad-boy with a heart of gold: he is annoyed with Carol at first but he slowly likes her and feels sorry for her. And Terry is your typical movie nerd, who is bullied, used and abused and is socially awkward: but he is optimist and wants to get with a pretty (properly the first girl who has shown any interest). John and Terry are the funniest characters in the film: they have the funniest lines and the funnier scenarios. Terry particularly is in a scenario many young men have been in, trying to impress a young girl and buying alcohol underage. One of the funniest jokes was expertly parodied by The Simpsons.I do have to question this world the characters live, where it is okay for men to pick up young girls in their cars, a girl allows her younger sister to go with a much other man, a man obviously looking for a girl to have sex with and these teenagers are out all night and their parents do not question it? I am also surprised that American Graffiti has a PG rating because there is a bit of swearing, but I assume this was because the PG-13 and 12 ratings were created.George Lucas was able to make a fast paced film after a slow start. The driving scenes are well done, Lucas is a man who knows how to make action sequence. The jokes and humour is actually good and some of the issues are try to life. This is also the best dialogue Lucas has achieved, but that is possibly because he was not the only writer for the film. He knows how to create an atmosphere and despite the night setting, he visuals are strong: Lucas knew how to use the headlights and neon lights of the setting and you can still tell what is happening, compared to some more modern films.Overall, it is an enjoyable film and it is interesting to see Lucas making a more grounded film.",American Graffiti
52,ackstasis,"""Where were you in '62?""",8,18 January 2008,"It wasn't until 1988 that your humble reviewer emerged into this world, and yet I can now declare, with complete conviction, that I have experienced the early 1960s! George Lucas' second film, following the science-fiction 'THX 1138 (1971),' is a wildly entertaining blast-from-the-past, a delirious dose of nostalgia that recreates an era when life was apparently so much simpler. President Kennedy had not yet been assassinated, the Vietnam War was still three years away, and teenagers occupied their time by eating at the local diner, cruising around in their vintage automobiles, and looking for young women to woo. Lucas' trip down memory lane, inspired by his own teenage years, obviously struck a chord with audiences of the 1970s, his low-budget picture becoming a considerable financial success, and being nominated for a respectable five Oscars {including Best Screenplay, Best Director and Best Picture}. The film's influence continued to stretch across the decades, inspiring similarly-nostalgic TV shows such as ""Happy Days (1974),"" and ensuring the development of the director's next project, the legendary 'Star Wars (1977).' The events of 'American Graffiti (1973)' unfold on a single hot summer night in 1962, as four recently-graduated small-town students waste away the hours of darkness in their hapless attempts at young romance. The four leading men each boast a distinct personality, their clear-cut characterisations highlighting the apparent simplicity of the era in which they lived. Steve Bolander (Ron Howard) is an eager, intelligent young romantic whose fondness for his girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams) makes leaving for college a difficult decision; Terry Fields (Charles Martin Smith) is a bumbling, completely-uncool wannabe whose recent acquisition of Steve's car gives him added confidence in interacting with girls; Curt Henderson (Richard Dreyfuss) is a bright and promising student looking for a reason to remain in town; John Milner (Paul Le Mat) is an ultra-smooth rebel with a reputation for having the fastest car in the region, though his unplanned rendezvous with a chattery, thirteen-year-old girl reveals a tenderness that he didn't know he possessed.George Lucas created 'American Graffiti' on a modest budget, with filming taking place primarily at night over a period of one month. Francis Ford Coppola, fresh from his success with 'The Godfather (1972),' agreed to produce the film. Though the original cut, later described by editor Verna Fields as ""one hell of a picture,"" ran for an epic 165 minutes, it was rejected by Universal Pictures and sliced down to a more audience-friendly length. Nevertheless, 110 minutes is more than enough time to experience the fashion, lifestyles  and, yes  the music of 1962. The incredible rock soundtrack, featuring more than forty well-known hits from the period, blends effortlessly into the action of the story, and the radio show of disc jockey Wolfman Jack becomes a character of its own. The main actors and actresses deliver convincingly natural performances, with special credit going to Richard Dreyfuss, who plays the bright but restless Curt with a contemplative earnestness. Also look out for an emerging Harrison Ford, whose drawling Bob Falfa is so out-of-sync with the rest of his career that you can't help but chuckle.",American Graffiti
53,CubsandCulture,Off brand but Lucas' best film,10,9 March 2020,"This is a engaging, thoughtful film that plays like a great soundtrack. The film is best on the level of invoking the mood and tenor of car culture c. 1962. Lucas' technical direction is stellar and the visual compositions and blocking add up to a series of iconic images that sell the nostalgia. This is a film to watch on repeat. It is a visual album.The story is something of an ur-text for teenage coming of age dramedies. It is really easy how say Superbad came out of this film. It is really fun seeing the various connections to later works. On its own it is funny and fun story to waste an evening on.Lucas made Star Wars right after this; in a way that is unfortunate. This is easily the superior work and it would have been nice to see what film in this vein Lucas could have made had not Star Wars sucked up all his time and effort.",American Graffiti
54,JoeKarlosi,American Graffiti (1973) ****,10,11 June 2011,"A wonderful coming of age experience, with memorable characters, classic rock songs, and a lot of fun and heart. Director George Lucas (STAR WARS) wanted to make a movie depicting the last days of innocence in America in the year 1962, when teenagers cruised town in attractive cars and listened to music that was actually good, and before John F. Kennedy got assassinated and the world succumbed to the hippie counter-culture, Vietnam, and drug abuse. The film operates on one never-ending summer's night, with four different stories which are all interwoven at different points, with characters cruising town in cars and listening to disc jockey Wolfman Jack along the way. The first concerns Steve and Lori (played by Ron Howard and Cindy Williams, before they were hits on TV with HAPPY DAYS and LAVERNE & SHIRLEY). They're a couple in love, but Steve intends to get out of the small town they're living in by going away to college, and Lori is distressed about their future together. This is perhaps the most average portion of the movie.The second situation is just pure hilarity, as the geek known as Terry the Toad (Charles Martin Smith - in a really likable performance) manages to pick up a pretty blonde who looks like Sandra Dee (Candy Clark). Together they get into all sorts of predicaments while trying to buy booze, and getting their car stolen.The third scenario features a macho-guy car racer named John Milner (Paul Le Mat, years before Fonzie), who gets stuck having to cruise the strip in his souped-up dragster with the accompaniment of a 12-year-old girl (Mackenzie Phillips). Le Mat and Phillips really have a good chemistry together, and go through some humorous and heartening situations. Milner also had to contend with a new racer in town (Harrison Ford) who's trying to challenge his position as undefeated champ.Then we have Curt Henderson (played by a young Richard Dreyfuss), a complex high school graduate who has his heart set on going away to college the next morning, but finds himself in conflict as to whether or not it's worth leaving home. Dreyfuss finds himself smitten by a mysterious and unattainable blonde goddess who frequently drives by him in a white T-bird (Suzanne Somers), and also unwittingly finds himself stumbling onto the turf of a tough gang called The Pharoahs, who insist on forcing him to join their group.The ending of the film drives home the point of how these were the last days of carefree innocence. I suppose many of us will be able to identify with our own younger years, and relate to what it was like. If we're lucky, we'll also be able to recall having had a handful of such special nights ourselves during our bygone days of youth. **** out of ****",American Graffiti

57,TOMNEL,George Lucas's first good script and last (?),9,31 May 2008,"Don't get me wrong, the first Star Wars film is a masterpiece for many reasons, but none of them are the clunky dialogue in the script. George Lucas is known for, along with his special effects and Star Wars films, awful scripts. The most recent Star Wars films are so poorly written they make me cringe, and this is George Lucas's only good script to date, possibly because it wasn't entirely written by him. ""American Graffiti"" is a low budget classic that really makes you feel like you're in 1962, and by the end, you won't want to leave.Here we have four stories about teens graduating high school, each one different, each one surprisingly good. There's Curt (Richard Dreyfus) who's confused if he wants to go to college or just stay home and go to junior college. After some turn of events, he ends up with a gang of hoodlums. Steve (Ron Howard) said the wrong thing to his girlfriend and is trying to patch things up. Terry (Charles Martin Smith) is taking care of Steve's car when Steve goes away to college, and he picks up a good lookin' chick, which results in many comedic situations. John Milner (Paul Le Mat) is a drag racer trying to pick up chicks, but he gets more than he bargained for when he ends up with the 13 year old sister (played by a young Mackenzie Phillips) of a female acquaintance of his. All four of these stories take place over one night, and they all level each other out nicely.All the kids give good performances here. Some are stereotypes, but they are likable stereotypes that break out of the mold and become more than one dimensional characters. The sub-plots are genuinely funny, and in some ways this actually reminds me of two later movies rolled into one. This movie is like John Landis's two films ""Animal House"" and ""The Blues Brothers"" packed into one good movie. It has the rowdy teens, and fast cars, and it has the cool 50's and early 60's music. The situations these characters face are often imitated in more recent films. For example, in ""Superbad"", an underage character trying to but alcohol almost gets away with it, but the store is robbed. Here, the character gets away with it, and the store is robbed...it's like the same scenario.I know my review contained a few comparisons to other films, but with a great teen comedy like this, all you can do is compare it to imitators, and this comes out on top. Perhaps a young George Lucas was inspired to (co)write this good script, or perhaps he just happened to strike lightening, something his writing would not do again. Prove me wrong Mr. Lucas! My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 110 mins. PG for language, sexual innuendos.",American Graffiti

From the town Big shot, the future Race car Driver, the Perfect Couple, and the local Nerd, it is amazing how the audience identifies with all these characters from out past. Like a page out of the high school year book, this movie jumps back into the early 60's, before the war, before the lines were drawn, the age of innocence in America would soon be coming to an end. This is the last party of the summer before the dream finally ends.",American Graffiti
59,ShootingShark,Looks Like I'm Going Nowhere,5,23 October 2013,"In 1962 in a small town in California four friends - Curt, Toad, John and Steve - celebrate their last night before Curt and Steve are due to leave to go to college. They go cruising, pick up girls, hang out and have various misadventures while trying to work out what to do with their lives.This amazing movie truly captures the spirit of what life was like for young people in America in the early sixties; rock-and-roll radio, chrome-covered tailfin cars with bench seats, sockhops, burger joints, jd gangs, hotrod races, fights and heavy petting. If ever an American movie was a timepiece, this is it; although it was made only ten years after it's set, that world was already long gone in the post-hippy, post-Vietnam early seventies and the exquisite recreation of it is breathtaking. However, there's a problem for me, which is simply that I can't get into it. The teenage angst / leaving home theme is universal I guess, but the world is so specific and so far removed from the world I grew up in (in Europe in the eighties) that I just can't identify with it. This is probably why the movie was a huge hit in the US but not really anywhere else. I need a coupla old time songs to evoke mood in a film but this one has forty-five - the music is a barrage of constant noise, deliberately designed so you can't escape it. The movie was hugely influential on the teenage comedy subgenre, but as with all such movies the characters are a bit thin; Toad and John are too obvious as putz and tough guy respectively, Steve is a wimp who can't think of anything but his girlfriend, and only Curt has any brains. That's not to say the cast are bad because they're all great, particularly Dreyfuss, LeMat and Clark, and one of the film's kicks is to see so many young actors who went on to such distinguished careers. In the end though, despite its incredible look, daring style and great originality, this is a film which I simply can't get into. What's really fascinating about it to me though is the what if question about Star Wars; if it hadn't been such a phenomenon, is this the kind of evocative drama Lucas would have spent his career making ? He grew up in small town California in a place called Modesto, where the movie is ostensibly set, although it was filmed mostly in San Rafael and Petaluma, and there are obvious autobiographical elements to it. Don't miss this film if you are a petrolhead - the 1932 Ford Deuce Coupe, 1958 Chevy Bel Air, 1958 Ford Thunderbird and 1955 Chevy One-Fifty alone are worth the admission, and cult film fans should check the license plate of LeMat's Deuce Coupe. Written by Lucas, Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck, produced by Francis Coppola and followed by a little-known sequel, More American Graffiti (also starring most of the original cast) in 1979.",American Graffiti
60,gazzo-2,da Wolfman AND Bo Hopkins in the same film-oh yeahhhhh!!,8,17 March 2000,"This film is great, I have always been a huge fan of the '55-63 era of music, film, tv, etc. Lucas hit a national nerve with this in '73, when the 60s had finally peeled away to a close and what a good chunk of the country wanted was to look before them. Here was The Nostalgia decade of choice. You think that the 60s were 'in' during the 80s, or the 70s in the 90s...you haven't seen anything like what happened about the time American Graffitti came out. Acts like Rick Nelson, Elvis, Chuck Berry, the Beach Boys, the Four Season, Paul Anka, Neil Sedaka and Bobbie Vinton all had big comebacks c. '74 or so. Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley and Grease were huge. Doo wop oldies shows ruled the AM dials. But nothing quite caught the Mood better than American Graffitti, seems to me.What isn't there to like? Paul Le Mat seems to be the one guy outta the leads who really didn't wind up having much of a career, to me that's a shame. He comes across as being clearly Ford's equal, kinda reminding me of a Ray Liotta with more of a swagger. I love seeing Richie Cunningham, the kid from 'One Day at a Time', Toad, Suzanne Sommers, the Jerry Reed lookalike contenst winner Bo Hopkins AND the Wolfman in this. What a good, young, talented group here! The soundtrack is terrific, have always loved the doo wop and rockabilly that you hear here. Plus those vintage cars, and the utterly genuine feel for the early 60s that seeps through in every frame....Lucas really got it right here.Why hasn't he been able to give us another film with such well rounded characters(besides the first two Star Wars films, I spose...)? I wish I knew. This one was one of The seminal films of the 70s, along with 'the Exorcist' and 'the Sting', its made '73 a year to remember.The Gazzo-2 rating? **** of course. Go see!",American Graffiti
61,eric262003,Though Set In The Sixties It Reflects All Generations,9,12 March 2019,"Sure this movie was made on a meagre budget, one thing we can all agree on is that ""American Graffiti"" touched the lives of many especially to those who are at the later stages of adolescence. And you can't put a profit on that. Even though it is set in the 1960's the message is reflective to youth of all generations.Set in the warm sunny skies of Modesto, California of 1962, we follow the lives of two teenage guys who are moving up in the world as they graduate from high school who may gain a diploma for their accomplishments at the cost of losing their youthful freedom forever. We follow the lives of Steve Bolander (Ron Howard) and Curt Henderson (Richard Dreyfuss) as both of them are about to go off to college in Northeastern California. While Steve is looking forward to this new journey, Curt is a bit reluctant about the whole situation leaving the town he lived all his life. Steve and Curt drive down the strip over to Mel's Drive-In where they're greeted by two other friends, a drag racer named John Milner (Paul Le Mat) and Terry ""The Toad"" Fields (Charles Martin Smith) as vent about life after high school and that the changes in their lives will impact upon them for all eternity.While reflecting the goals and the angst with Steve and Curt's journey, we also focus on the struggles and the laments of the supporting characters too. In the case of John he has been rather dismissive about adulthood for a while he also is accompanied by an annoying teenage girl named Carol Morrison (Mackenzie Phillips) who has lustful feelings with John. John is a rather lamented soul who feels that the strip is falling from grace rather quickly and that his love for rock 'n roll hasn't been the same since Buddy Holly's death (he even hates Beach Boys music) and that he has no intentions to stop drag racing and picking up hot girls. He'll go even further to challenge much older drag racer Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford) for a race which turns out quite unflattering. Carol meanwhile tries to interact and get adjusted to the lives of these reckless youths, perhaps in her case more than she thought. Even to the the point of questioning herself if being with John might not be the right path to take. Writer and director George Lucas uses the balancing of the relations of John and Carol along with Steve and Curt to demonstrate the real educational lessons of entering adulthood. And that if they can't handle the pressures of adulthood, than they will eternally remain as kids.Rounding off the other characters in this character-driven movie is a mystery bombshell who drives a 1956 T-Bird (Suzanne Somers) in which Curt is pining over just like Steve has an attraction to Curt's sister Laurie (Cindy Williams). While T-Bird girl is luring Curt into a more adventurous journey, Laurie is making sure that she is keeping Steve grounded as much as possible. when they return to their school they recalled the memories they had there as they say goodbye to it one more time. Curt on the other hand finds it difficult to let his past go but gets reassurance from a teacher who encourages him to not let this opportunity to leave town slip by.If there is one character that truly shines it would have to be the character of Terry ""The Toad"" Fields. Terry is a socially awkward individual who's academically gifted but belittled by practically everyone. But who says the brainy ones don't get the girls? He gets the love from a rebellious girl named Debbie Dunham (Candy Clark).And sure this was a coming-of-age story, there's plenty of dimension to the characters and it helped launched the careers of plenty of then unknowns into superstars in the film industry. Even though it's setting was in the 1960's you don't have to have been born in that era to understand the life struggles the pertains to these characters. Even in 2019 as we speak, escaping from youthfulness into adulthood is as painful and scary as they come, though the rewards can be plentiful if you work hard and taking the pains that come.",American Graffiti
62,Christmas-Reviewer,Bigger Ground Breaker than Star Wars,10,14 February 2006,"This was George Lucas first big Hollywood Blockbuster. It broke ground on so many levels. First it was a nostalgia picture. (Made in the 1970's about the last days of American Innocence pre Kenedy Assasanation). This was also a fragmented story! It had different points of view from different people. This was the first movie that had more than 1 story going on. This was also the first movie to play ""Rock and Roll Classics"" instead of having new songs written for the movie. There was no soundtrack per say it was just music coming from the cars that provided the soundtrack. This movie was also a meal ticket for many stars. The people that were in this movie all of them parlayed into further success. Ron Howard..need I say more. Cindy Williams became one of TV' biggest stars of the 1970's. Susan Richardson (had a cameo) was the cast in ""Eight is Enough"". Harrison Ford.. need I say more. Everyone in this became a star if Noe a superstar! The movie holds up and if you never have seen this well your missing a CLASSIC..",American Graffiti
63,Analog_Devotee,Masterpiece,10,4 January 2021,"When I finished this film for the first time, I immediately rewound and started over from the beginning. I even watched it two more times the following week, and a few more over the course of the next couple months. I truly can't get enough of this film. I can't think of another instance where I've done that -- that's how much this film captivated me upon first viewing. Now, I've seen it countless times, and I'll even put it on for background noise while doing other things. If I'm in the mood to watch a film but not sure what I want to watch, I almost always gravitate to American Graffiti. No matter my mood, I can always sit down and enjoy this one.Though it is a timepiece, it truly is timeless. This is my favorite Lucas film by far.While I've been a film geek for quite a long time, I've never related more to characters as much as I did these, even if I didn't grow up during the same time period. And that's the beauty of it, I guess -- you don't have to've come of age during this era to relate and appreciate what the characters are all going through. We've been there -- maybe with different music, fashion and cars, but we've still been there. It's familiar territory.The era is captured perfectly without being shoved down your throat. It's there, it's prominent, but it's simultaneously subtle due to being wrapped in a thick blanket of engaging characters and happenings. You're not just a viewer, you're truly along for the ride.Also, why the hell wasn't Paul Le Mat in more flicks? He was my favorite actor in this! Guy should've been a star.",American Graffiti
64,Spuzzlightyear,Funny how it seems,7,24 September 2005,"This movie was an innovator in so many ways. Essentially following a group of teens around during one night in 1962, American Graffiti essentially paved the way for a lot of things. First of all, it was one of the first movies that had multiple character studies happening, inter cutting from one to the next, was the movie that got Lucas noticed, and most of all, seemed to star every young actor that later went on big, Ron Howard, Cindy Williams, Mackenzie Phillips, Wolfman Jack, Richard Dreyfus, Susanne Somers, Wolfman Jack, Susanne Somers, and Paul LeMat . The best performances here come from Dreyfus of course, who was just amazing in his early roles, because he was just cackling with energy (see Duddy Kravitz as well as a great example) and Paul LeMat who hasn't had quite the career as everyone else in the cast, but still shined in amazing roles (Melvin and Howard being an excellent example).",American Graffiti
65,RNMorton,Doesn't age as well as Frankie Avalon,7,10 March 2005,"Or maybe I've just seen enough of it and am being too tough. Seventies view of fifties kids coming of age while cruising the main drag one hot California night. Good look at several actors on their way to stardom. Ironically, the memorable performance are by Le Mat in a pre-Fonzie Fonzie role and Clark as the smart/dumb blonde, neither of whom made it big. The short Wolfman Jack segment is also inspired. On the whole, though, suffers from later Lucas maladies - too full of itself and too overdone. And it really hasn't aged so gracefully, but in fairness that's partly because of all of its cheap imitators. At one time I would have given it an 8 or 9, now I just throw it a 7 and deem it not frequently rewatchable.",American Graffiti
66,Sergiodave,A coming of age classic,8,31 October 2021,"American Graffiti is a classic of American cinema. Produced by Francis Ford Coppola, written and directed by George Lucas and starring then unknown actors, this movie is set over one day in early 1960's California. This is one of the best coming of age movies, alongside 'The Outsiders', another Coppola flick. Richard Dreyfuss is brilliant in the lead role, and whilst Ron Howard was okay, you can see why he went behind the camera. Interestingly this is the only time Ron Howard has worked with Harrison Ford, who didn't show much future promise in acting, but for me was memorable for attempting to sing 'Some Enchanted Evening' from 'South Pacific'. This is a great movie showing how the American middle class teenagers lived in the rock & roll age. Oh, and unsurprisingly the the music in the movie is amazing.",American Graffiti
67,classicalsteve,"The More I View This Film, The More I am Convinced It Is Lucas' Masterpiece, and He May Never Top It",10,25 July 2010,"Certainly, George Lucas will be best remembered for the Star Wars and Indiana Jones' franchises which transcended mere cinema by creating a kind of world fueled by SF Fandom. However upon multiple viewings of American Graffiti, I am convinced that Graffiti is really Lucas' best effort, and certainly his best offering in terms of character development, honest dialog, and nostalgic sensibility. Star Wars, the first and second movies retitled Episode IV and V, and Indiana Jones 1 and 3 are certainly Lucas' most visually stunning and entertaining movies, and ground-breaking in that they gave Science Fiction and Fantasy an entirely new audience beginning in the late 1970's. Simultaneously, American Graffiti was the sleeper hit of the early 1970's at a time when the film industry desperately needed new voices.Studio executives of the time were bewildered by film audiences' tastes. Initially, the idea of a film about young people of the late 1950's and early 1960's was categorically dismissed, especially since it had been pitched by the director of THX 1138 which had bombed miserably at the box office a few years earlier. But the studios were also reeling over such box office disasters as ""Paint Your Wagon"" and ""Doctor Dolittle"", which were much larger risks than THX. On one hand, the studios were afraid to take any kind of risk, but they also realized that being in the film industry is essentially about constantly navigating unchartered territory. Just like dating, there are no ""sure things"" in film. What they didn't know was there was a new crop of young movie-goers who had driven cool cars while cruising for girls in the 1950's and early 1960's, all the while listening to a new kind of music called Rock 'n' Roll. This young person's subculture, which predated the counter-culture movement of a few years later, had been scarcely acknowledged, let alone celebrated, by anything cinematic.Sometimes the best material can come from a relatively simple basic premise. The essential ""plot"" (if plot it can be called) of Graffiti is so straightforward, it seems like it couldn't possibly be successful. Graffiti is about a single night in 1962 concerning five high school friends about to embark on adulthood. For one last night, the go out cruising while listening to the sublime music of the era, two years before the Beatles hit the American pop scene and on the eve of the counter-culture movement which probably would have been almost unimaginable at this moment in time. Most of the characters drive in cars from the era, and the cars themselves become characters in a sense. Most of the action takes place on the streets of a nameless American town in which young people, both young men and young women, are simply trying to have a good time.The film is a series of character-driven vignettes concerning Curt (Richard Dreyfus), Steve (Ron Howard), Laurie (Cindy Williams), John (Paul le Mat), and Terry ""The Toad"" (Charles Martin Smith) having a night on the town in an out-of-the-way suburban area of California. (In fact the story was supposed to take place in Modesto, CA (Lucas' hometown), but because of logistic problems, the production was moved to Petaluma, CA.) Accompanying them on their escapades are two elements entrenched in the eyes and ears of the era: their cars and their music. Every scene has a different hit song from the period being played, something almost unheard of except for possibly ""The Graduate"". The music echos through the streets as if every one in the town is tuned to the same radio station being DJ-ed by the immortal Wolf Man Jack. Curt has earned a collegiate scholarship but is unsure about his future, and then he sees in a T-Bird, the ideal woman of his dreams, played by Suzanne Somers, mouthing the words ""I love you"". Steve and Laurie are in a relationship threatened by the possibility he might leave for college; Laurie still has another year in High School. John and Terry the Toad are lovable losers who seem like they will live and die in this town, unless they radically change who they are. John does own a cool car but he gets stuck with having to drive with a pre-teen girl. He is then confronted by an outsider, Bob played by Harrison Ford, who challenges John to a race. Meanwhile, Terry the Toad who probably is not as successful with women as Toad from ""The Wind and the Willows"" meets a somewhat flirtatious blond named Debbie. He drives in Steve's car, an Impala, and pretends it's his. There is no way to describe why this film works as well as it does. The acting is right on the money, the dialog seems completely natural and not scripted. The scenes were shot with real cars that were really driving, bringing an end to the era of the phony-looking back screen that was used in movies all the way up until this time. While all the actors are first-rate, my personal favorite is actually Charles Martin Smith as Terry the Toad. For me, he and Candy Clark as Debbie almost steal the show, although all the different vignettes are compelling and mesmerizing.As there are no downsides to this film at all, a near-perfect cinematic experience, the only downside is that after the third Indiana Jones film, Lucas seems to have lost his edge in writing. His characters in his more recent offerings, particularly the last three Star Wars films(which are actually episodes I, II, and III) seem flat and lifeless, and his dialog cliché and uninspired. Where did he lose his edge? The fine writing he exhibited in Graffiti seems to be from a different hand if not a different person. Lucas of the 2000's was not the same as the Lucas of the 1970's and early 1980's. Maybe by becoming such a mega-player in film, he lost the talent of his younger and hungrier days.",American Graffiti
68,hall895,A good but not great look back,6,8 July 2005,"Before taking us all to a galaxy far, far away George Lucas brought us a story that hits much closer to home. American Graffiti is the story of one crucial night in the lives of a group of small-town California teenagers in 1962. It may seem odd that by 1973 one could already make a nostalgia piece about the 1960s. But that is what Lucas has done and it works because as the events in these young people's lives take place the world is very rapidly changing all around them. By 1973 it was easy to look back at the early 1960s as being a much more innocent time, one we very well might wish we could return to.American Graffiti takes its cast of mostly unknowns (most of whom would not remain unknown for long) and gives each character his or her own story to tell. If forced to pick out one character as the lead you'd probably have to go with Ron Howard's Steve, the outgoing class president set to leave for college the next morning. Other key characters include Steve's buddy Curt, as played by Richard Dreyfuss, who is supposed to go to college with Steve but is beginning to have his doubts as to whether he should go. Cindy Williams plays Steve's girlfriend Laurie who is none too happy to be left behind as her boyfriend departs. Charles Martin Smith gives a great performance as hapless Terry The Toad who will have his own adventures with the beautiful Debbie, played by Candy Clark. Harrison Ford has a small but key role as the new guy in town. Mackenzie Phillips does a fine job as Carol, a young girl who would desperately like to hang with the older cool kids such as John Milner, played by Paul Le Mat, who has the fastest car in town. Ah yes, the cars. The cars and the terrific period music are just as much the stars of the movie as any of the actors.Over the period of one night all these characters will be faced with decisions which will in ways, some great and some small, shape their lives. It is very much a movie about coming of age as our characters make the awkward transition into adulthood. Some do it more gracefully than others. Each of their stories is interesting in its own way and all the acting performances are fine. But with the story going in so many different directions at once something gets lost. At times the film struggles to move forward as we're constantly shifting from one character's individual story to another. There are a number of great character studies here and it's fascinating to see these people grow right before our eyes in the span of just one night. However the film probably would have been much crisper and a little more entertaining if the plot was a little more focused. Three or four stories would probably have worked better than seven or eight. Then again all the characters are fascinating in their own way and the acting is so good it would be a shame to have lost any of the performances. Eventually everything comes together and the film is left with what could have been a perfect ending. Unfortunately, it's marred by an unnecessary postscript where we get more information than we need or quite frankly want. Some things are best left to our own imagination. But I guess you make do and appreciate American Graffiti for what it is and not what you might wish for it to have been.",American Graffiti
69,johno-21,A great movie from a decade of great movies,10,13 March 2006,"This is a great movie. I saw this in the theater during it's initial theatrical release and have seen it probably 20 times since. What a fun coming of age slice of Americana of the early 60's still living in the 1950's. A fantastic young cast in Richard Dreyfus, Ron Howard, Cindy Williams, Candy Clark, MdKenzie Phillips, Paul Le Mat, Charles Martin Smith, Bo Hopkins, Kathleen Quinlan and featuring Harrison Fors and Suzanne Sommers. This was nominated for 5 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director as well as Supporting Actress for Clark and Screenplay and Film Editing. George Lucas had previous directed a film that he adapted as a full-length theatrical feature from a student film he had made called THX 1138 and then followed that with the very different American Graffiti here in his only second film. Hollywood recognized his genius with two of the biggest Academy Award nominations for Best Picture and Best Director. Lucas' dream was his Star Wars series which he devoted the rest of his time as a film maker doing which he is of course deservedly acclaimed for but I would have liked to have more films by Lucas more like American Graffiti. Any thing besides the Star Wars theme. A great soundtrack here with tons of great original recordings from the Rock and roll era of the late 50's and early 60's. This film still stands up wheel and I would give it a 10 and highly recommend it.",American Graffiti
70,adamscastlevania2,Made when Lucas cared,7,2 September 2014,"(62(it had to be)%) ""Where were you in in 62?"" Nowhere I wasn't born yet. A confusing aspect here is that if Lucas wrote this, then how can he explain the crappy scripts of the Star wars prequels? This is a rose-tinted trip back to when cars were made of metal and music had to be at least half decent to get on the radio. There isn't a whole lot to the story as most of the characters spend a large spell of the run-time driving up and down their town looking for fun, but it's well acted/made, and the tragic sense that the simple fun days of the character's youth are coming to an end and will never return is handled well. It's overly nostalgic, but funny at times and sweet-natured, although I'd have liked some more meat on the bones.",American Graffiti
71,stamper,"There is Road Trip, there's American Pie and there is American Graffiti",7,3 February 2002,"There are a lot of college and university films out there lately and I thought: Why not see an old one.' I mean the new ones are basically just plain rude (though that does not mean they are not fun). I just wanted to see how that sort of film was made in the 70's. Besides that, the fact that it was successful and that it has a great cast and crew (Lucas (writer & director); Coppola (producer); Dreyfuss and Ford (actors)). All this quality really did not disappoint me. It was a fairly good film, with a couple of laughs and a good story, although there was not much of a story. It is basically a film, that follows the good and the bad things that happen to 4 guys in a night in a town. Pretty good for the 70's. One thing is unsatisfying though: who is that BLONDE???

72,gab-14712,Who Knew Cruising Could Be So Entertaining!,8,18 October 2017,"Seeing the reviews for American Graffiti from the old-timers make me want to relive my childhood and teenage life all over again. There are memories created that will never die but it makes you long for those memories. Of course, I'm not an old man and my childhood culture isn't the same culture set in this film. This is the generation of my parents and they know about this culture even better than I do, but the message is the same. It's all about remembering the times you had when growing up. The year this film took place is 1963, and boy was everything so different when compared to today. Everyone back then listened to the radio, cruised amongst the highways looking for women to pick up, hung out at the local drive-in restaurant, and so forth. People either went to college or just found a local job and set out cruising. Gosh life was so simple back then! This film authenticity was created with the driving force of director and screenwriter's George Luca's attempt to show what it's like to grow up in such a world. The film took awhile to come into fruition because studios felt scared of this film and the lackluster results of 1971's THX 1138, but it was worth it because Lucas brought his childhood back to life and made me dream about living this kind of life. Lucas, after the instant success of this film, became a household name.The film has a variety of characters with interconnected stories. Everyone has their own story, but each character fits into the whole scheme of things. It was a very hard task to pull off, but Lucas did a great job in getting me to care for these characters. There are the two best buddies, Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard) who have gotten into a wonderful college, but on the night before they leave for school, Curt has second thoughts about college. He decides to spend his night pursuing a woman he heard about on the radio who drives a white T-Bird. Steve spends the night trying to make up with his girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams) after he tells her they should see other people while he is at school. Meanwhile, there are two other friends who have their own adventures. John (Paul Le Mat) is forced to drive around a little girl, Carol (Mackenize Phillips) as he seeks out a hot rod racer Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford) to race. And the nerdy Terry (Charles Martin Smith) borrows Steve's car but gets in trouble when he picks up a girl.I loved the casting choices Lucas made. There are no big names (for 1973), and some of these names would go on to have spectacular careers and this film gave birth to the careers of future Oscar-winners. This is Harrison Ford's first film role as he was studying a career in carpentry at the time. Ford would later make a big name for himself in Star Wars and Indiana Jones. Richard Dreyfuss used this film to shed his identity as a child actor and he does it very well. This role may have gotten him his famed role in Jaws. Little people remember that Ron Howard used to be an actor before he became a very famous director, but this movie shows that he knew how to act. Paul Le Mat was great as guy who tries to show off how tough he is, but he cannot because he has a strong heart. I loved his character's interactions with the 12-year-old Carol who was a very funny character herself. Maybe that is what softened his heart. But I liked how Lucas made his characters representations of his younger self. For example, the Terry character is a resemblance of Lucas his freshman year in high school where he came across as nerdy and had terrible luck with girls.This film was made on such a cheap budget, that a musical score could not be produced. However, Lucas used his artistic license to gather a great collection of old rock'n'roll to use on the film. He used great music from the likes of the Rolling Stones and Bill Haley and the Comets. That made me appreciate the film more because of its use of music. The music also gave flavor to its authenticity because this is the kind of music people listened to back in this time period. The use of Wolfman Jack (a very famed L.A DJ) showed how much he and radio meant to the people of this era.American Graffiti is a very good film that shows how life was like for teenagers in the early 60's just when rock music was coming to dominate the airwaves. My dad saw this film when it was released and he says it is one of his favorite movies and it's an accurate representation of an era that has disappeared except for everlasting memories. Thanks to a energetic soundtrack and believable characters, I was able to understand each character. That being said, sometimes it feels like this film is too experimental. I'm not all too big on experimental films, but luckily Lucas found away to turn this into a very good film. Not my favorite film with growing-of-age films, but it's still worth a watch. Especially to see early acting from the likes of Harrison Ford and Richard Dreyfuss.My Grade: B+",American Graffiti

Watch it,man!",American Graffiti
74,Angry_Arguer,One-Night Stand,10,11 January 2004,"You can call this Lucas' only worthwhile effort as director and you can also label it sentimental tripe.  It depends on your opinion of Lucas, his writing, and his cast.The cast is mixed, the men mostly overreact.  I found Ron Howard to be the worst in the bunch, perhaps it's from this Lucas influence that Howard's been making empty junk since this.  Perhaps Dreyfuss matured the most.Verna Fields' editing great; I have never been disappointed in it.  It's obvious why Spielberg relied on her for JAWS.  Just watch this for her contribution alone.After Star Wars' silly excess of fantasy and poor pacing, Lucas has had his head stuck in a Samurai-influenced fantasy land.  He still does.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material",American Graffiti

76,Pedro_H,Magical documentary about a place that never really existed.,9,3 October 2002,"In the days before George Lucas was laid up in his Skywalker Ranch thinking of how  to make even more money out of the Star Wars brand he was, amazingly, a very different film maker. (Before percent points on lunch boxes took over his life, maybe one of the top ten directors of all time.)American Graffiti is all the evidence anyone would need.
The film is really about nothing, that is its secret weapon: A lot of college kids, cruising around Small Town California circa 1962. Every Small Town cliché character is given at least one outing: The town bully, the over-groomed college boy (and his clean-cut g/f), the town nerd, the hip DJ, the boy racer, the town's dim (but nice) blonde - need I go on?It all happens on one night (another signal that we are in clearly in movieland) and ends by telling us what happens to them (in bubble text no less!) when the Small Town bubble finally bursts. Although we are not told what happens to the town's dim blonde (Candy Clarke), because she doesn't count - not even to the film makers.  Yes, we are in a world before  Vietnam, AIDS and mass unemployment  when the worst thing that could happen to you was to be laughed at by your peers, have spots or be punched in the belly by a leather jacketed goon. When rock music blasted from every building and car (to help sell the soundtrack album) and there was always a sexy girl (or guy) to keep you company. Like so many world's - it probably never really existed anywhere or at any time - but there is enough truths, of sorts, for you to accept it as ""real"".They tried to re-create the magic in More American Graffiti (1979), but without Lucas all we had was clichés without magic, rather than clichés with.",American Graffiti
77,grahamsj3,One of the best ever made,9,2 November 2000,Holy cow! This is definitely one of the true classics. It explores the goings-on in what seems to be a relatively small town one summer night. Some of the kids are going off to college the next day while others stay behind. This is set in an age of innocence and the morality may seem a bit straight by today's standards. High School romances beginning and ending. Kids cruising the town in Hot Rods. Drag racing. Gangs. The best sound track I've ever heard (be sure to get it on DVD). The acting is absolutely first-rate by the entire cast - not a bad performance from anyone! This film is destined to be considered one of the great ones!,American Graffiti
78,AhmedSpielberg99,It nails youthful nostalgia almost perfectly!,8,25 March 2019,"This is definitely one of the most influential of all coming-of-age films. I assume that this movie has established a new narrative style, and has proved that nostalgic films are not necessarily made for the sake of nostalgia, for it captures the zeitgeist of the 1960s America instead of mimicking it. A notable example of the influence of American Graffiti is Richard Linklater's Dazed and Confused. And while I wasn't as engaged and invested in the characters of the former as I was with of the latter, American Graffiti admittedly is the more mature and thought-provoking of the two. The characters here have some depth you would probably never see in slice-of-life movies. And this comes from the sharp dialogue that fleshed out the characters throughout the movie's running time in a very subtle way.Some characters have better and more well-developed arcs than the others. They all are relatable, somewhat likable, and played by very good actors who did their best in their roles; but some character arcs feel as if they aren't fully-developed and lack some pieces in the middle. Ron Howard's character, Steve is a case in point; although I was quite invested in his character by the end of the movie.This leads us to my second issue with this movie, which I mentioned above. It's that the movie took me a little while to get into its characters and whole the story in general. I think the reason of this problem is that the movie promised me from its very beginning that it would focus on the characters' story-lines to flesh them out; not their journeys. Don't get me wrong, I adore slice-of-life and road movies, and I also knew that American Graffiti is this kind of a movie. But I guess the first minutes would a bit misleading, and therefore it took me sometime for the movie to draw me in.I can't praise the movie's soundtrack enough! I mean, it's absolutely one of the greatest film soundtracks ever! The movie wouldn't have been so nostalgic, if it wasn't for its killer soundtrack. It is a key factor in capturing the era's spirit, and also in giving the movie its distinctive bitter-sweet vibe. I think I won't stop listening to it for a long time!American Graffiti is also a proof that George Lucas is a great director as he is a great writer. I know that the dialogue is one of the film's best merits; but man, the camera work is so exquisite, and the color-grading is superb and quite expressive. The movie also has some brilliant moments of scene-blocking that, once again, gave the movie its evocative atmosphere.(8/10)",American Graffiti
79,elicopperman,Teens Were Teens in '62,7,5 July 2018,"45 years ago, just a few years before Star Wars, George Lucas and Francis Ford Coppola brought to the world a coming-of-age teen comedy called American Graffiti, which was somewhat of a nostalgic project for Lucas himself. Considering the film is set in 1962, one would imagine the whole movie could have been made around said time by Lucas on a Z-movie budget with no big studio involved. Either way, what followed was both a critical and commercial success, while helping kickstart the careers for the likes of Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, Charles Martin Smith, Paul le Mat and even Harrison Ford. With all that said, upon watching this movie, it is relatable enough to any teen who has to come to terms with their own life decisions after high school.The whole movie doesn't have one singular narrative, instead it is told through a series of vignettes that show a group of teenagers cruising around Modesto, California over a single night and getting into all sorts of mishaps. Whether it'd be Curt Henderson (Dreyfuss) getting involved with a street gang, Steve Bolander (Howard) facing a relationship crisis with his girlfriend Laurie (a.k.a. Curt's sister), or drag racer John Milner (le Mat) having to deal with an annoying 12 year old named Carol (Mackenzie Philips), each storyline really details the small struggles that teens may have faced back then, such as dueling, arguing, and relationship issues. Even with all these storylines happening at once, the film never feels messy, and the script contains many lovable characters who practically embrace the American culture of back then. In addition, the humor that mostly relies on dialogue is deliriously funny without getting lost from the more serious moments.Arguably the funniest arch comes from the bumbling insecure dork Terry Fields (Smith) and the adventurous blonde Debbie (Candy Clark), as Terry constantly tries and fails to hide his insecurity from her, like buying booze or lying about his car. In addition to displaying some of the more heartfelt and earnest moments on camera, both these characters display the best personalities on screen, and their dizzy albeit warm bubble-headedness is enough to grant even the tiniest of giggles. In addition, Harrison Ford is hysterical as the arrogant driver Bob Falfa, a man who wants to challenge Milner to a race but also feels that he's lost his touch in the spotlight. 
The film's soundtrack, consisting of multiple 50s and early 60s rock & roll songs, also becomes provocative throughout the movie, especially with disc jockey Wolfman Jack speaking through car radios and announcing all the hits, helping establish a parallel dramatic subtext. While it may run a little slow, the film's steadiness serves the story well to add into the character's disciplined nature, and even the pace at its most hectic never becomes overwhelming. Honestly, steady might be a good word to describe American Graffiti, as it's not meant to be some heavily faced paced screwball comedy, but more of a laid back teen movie that perfectly captures the antics of adolescents living their glory days before going out to the real world. I'd say give this a watch if you're into seeing the crazy shenanigans of teenagers during the happy/heavy times of the 1960s, or if you'd like to check out what else George Lucas directed besides Star Wars. Even if you won't entirely get all the references, you may end up feeling empathetic to these teens, since you yourself might have been one of them before.",American Graffiti
80,departed07,So Much For Being 17,10,23 October 2003,"I remember watching this movie on May 31, 2002, the night before my high school graduation and when I watch this film, it reminded me of the things that happened with me throughout my senior year: from a guy I knew, who cheated on his girlfriend with a cheerleader, to the terrorist attack that tore America apart; causing Americans to go against one another, from the crushes, the heartbreaks, prom night, to Spider-Man being the movie of the year, graduation rehearsal, and technology becoming the new aspect in my life and when I watched American Graffiti, it reminded me of when the good times meant something with those around me.The film takes place in 1962 California, a pre JFK assassination which showed the innocence of youth crusin' the streets and talking to buddies outside of their windows as they drive; now, in today's world it's a bloodbath. Even the music played a part of innocence back in the 60's where artist such as Fats Domino, Beach Boys, Bill Haley and the Comets, The Platters, even Chuck Berry were a pain in the butt to most of the adults of that time, but a joy. Now? Songs about sex, drugs, and murder have become the new waves to today's youth of America.American Graffiti has four teenage boys who cruise in different directions in their hometown where some question their own faith. The main character in the story is Curt Henderson (Richard Dreyfuss) who is about to leave east for college where he is dubious on whether or not he should leave town in order to start a new life. Yet his friend Steve (Ron Howard) encourages him to leave and tells him not to crawl back into his little nest. All night, Curt cruises the streets with his sister Laurie (Cindy Williams) and Steve, where he sees a blonde woman driving a white T-Bird who mouths ""I love you."" Now Curt is on the hunt to find this blonde woman as he encounters a gang called The Pharaohs who want to pound him after he scratches the gang's car.The next character is Steve whose Curt's best friend and happens to be dating Laurie and wants to rush things as quickly as possible. He wants to break up so they can see other people; but later when they are named King and Queen at the homecoming dance, they are together again where he tries to have sex with her. Yet, things don't work out well between them, and Steve questions his own destiny on whether he should stay or not, leaving Curt to be right as usual.John Milner (Paul LeMat) is the hotshot of the state who doesn't want to leave town because he is afraid that everything will change. After the beginning of the film he talks to Curt about ""The Pickin's are really getting' slim"" that everything is changing in terms of music, girls, crusin' the street even from his friends departing. He cruises the streets where he accidentally picks up an underage girl (MacKenzie Phillips) who becomes more of a pal to John as they listen to Wolfman Jack and hear good old time music. Yet, John is up for a little competition, as a new drag racer by the name of Bob Falfa, (Harrison Ford) wants to race him.The other character of the gang is Terry ""The Toad,"" Fields (Charles Martin Smith) the nerd who drives a mophead, gets to take Steve's car for a ride in the town. Yet, as he tries to impress people, he meets one girl Debbie (Candy Clark) who decides to go with Terry after she hears about him talking about his ""new"" car. Terry who thinks he is a reject is now proved that he is a man as he cruises the streets with the girl on his arms, and just trying to prove that even nerds have their moments as well.American Graffiti in my opinion is a retrospect of the good times that people had when everything was innocent, in an era where crusin' was important, especially rock n' roll. But as time changes on, people will always remember the good times.",American Graffiti
81,richieandsam,"Quite good, but not as good as expected.",6,21 October 2013,"American GRAFFITIA very early George Lucas film. I had heard about this but never seen it before. It was OK for its time.The movie is about a group of teenagers who have just graduated and it is their last night in town before they go off to college.The movie runs along quite smoothly. There is not a lot happening to be honest. It is about the relationships between these kids with their friends and girlfriends. There are some very nice cars in it, and even some car street races. These were shot very well and were really entertaining. Especially the final crash! There are so many different things going on during this time. The whole film is set during one night which is a nice touch.You have Curt who can't decide if he wants to leave for college as he is having second thoughts. Curt is played by Richard Dreyfuss. Richard did a great job like always. I think Richard is a great actor and should make more movies. He has already made so many classic films. Steve is Curts friend who is going to college with Curt. Curt is happy to be going to college and wants to spend one final night with his girlfriend before he leaves her behind the problem is, Steve doesn't really know how to talk to her and things do not go as smoothly as he hopes. Steve is played by Ron Howard. Ron was OK, but he is not the best actor. He did make me laugh a few times though which was great. Ron is a much better director than he ever was an actor so I am glad he found his feet behind the camera after Happy Days although I did love Happy Days when I was a kid.Other cast members were Paul Le Mat, Charles Martin Smith, Cindy Williams, Candy Clark, Mackenzie Phillips, Bo Hopkins and a very young Harrison Ford. The cast was quite good. There was not anyone that was that bad. There were a few moments in the film that I thought the acting wasn't brilliant, but back in 1973 when this film was made, the acting was a completely different class than it is now.The soundtrack to the movie was brilliant. I love the old songs that were played throughout the movie. I think it is possibly the perfect soundtrack to the era of the film. I have always thought the 60s looked awesome. If I could travel through time I would visit the 60s.The action sequences were OK and the story was OK.

82,moviemanMA,1962 in Revue,10,7 November 2005,"1962 was a time of change for America. The music was changing, the clothes were changing, the world, and the next generation of young adults, the ""baby boomer's"", are ready to go off to college. It was before the British Invasion and before the US got involved in Vietnam. Their were late nights cruising around with your favorite girl waiting to here that song on the radio. It was the time period of George Lucas's breakthrough picture.In Lucas's American Graffiti, we go back to one hot summer night in California where we join a group of friends for what may be their last night together for a while. It is especially restless for Curt and Steve (Richard Dreyfuss and Ron Howard) because they don't know whether or not to go onto college or not. Steve's girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams), Curt's sister, is not too pleased when Steve says that it's OK to ""see other people"" while he's away. For Curt, he spends the night looking for a blonde driving a white T-Bird that appears to say ""I Love You"" in his direction, but he can't be sure.The other half of the group is out trying to just have a good time. Steve gives his friend Terry ""The Toad"" his car to take care of while he's away at school. Right off the bat, Toad thinks he can just pick up any chick with wheels like that. He ends up seeing this platinum blonde by the name of Deborah (Candy Clark) and the two spend the night together, one neither of them will ever forget.John Milner (Paul Le Mat) is known for his tough roadster, the best in the valley. He patrols the streets looking for action, in particular a guy named Falfa (Harrison Ford) who is looking for him. Instead he cruises around with Carol (Mackenzie Phillips), a young teenager who hops into his car at a stop light. The two must try to get along or else she'll get him in trouble.Filmed virtually entirely at night, the movie has a very real aspect to it. The characters are like regular people with hopes and dreams that we all go through. We all want to leave home yet there is a part of us that wants to stay, a real coming of age story. Lucas incorporates not only a great script and a great story, but he uses the feel of the era. The music goes along with the mood of the story at that moment. The dialogue is straight out of that time period. The movie itself is a time capsule. American Graffiti is one of the first movies to have an entirely rock and roll soundtrack, with no music written for the picture what so ever. Having original music would have ruined the movie's appeal. His creative way of telling a story is very unique. But he wasn't the only one to emerge from the 1970's. There was Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and many others. It was a breakthrough age and Lucas truly stood out.This was his second feature length film, following the success of THX-1138, the movie based on his student film Electronic Labryinth THX-1138 4EB. He would later go onto make Star Wars, one of the highest grossing movies of all time, which lead to five other sequels and prequels. He also wrote the Indiana Jones trilogy.American Graffiti isn't just a movie, it's a tribute to what life used to be. To what the country used to be like. Lucas gives us a great film to enjoy for years to come.",American Graffiti
83,willcundallreview,Fast cars and crazy characters!,7,31 July 2014,"American Graffiti is a 70's film set in the 60's that is actually quite a funny and also fun adventure. With some greats of cinema so young acting in this and a script and direction done by a known name, this turns out to be well not in my opinion as good as people sometimes say it is, but nevertheless is good. I thought going into it that maybe it would be dull and just another teen comedy than runs out of jokes on the first corner but this is different and maybe being set in the 60's helped it out a bit. I thought it was a solidly good movie, and here below is why.The story is one that takes a little time to get into it, at first I felt it was never going to start properly and just like the cars, was going to stall fast. It does however get into a nicer flow of things and the comedy also in the middle and end of the movie really flows as well, it genuinely is funny stuff and should make people laugh if only just a little. I liked the ending too, I won't ruin it but you actually are interested in the characters involved and kind of want to see the thing they want, to happen.Richard Dreyfuss is the real star actor in this and his character Curt is funny, clumsy yet weirdly rational among all the crazy youths hanging around. Ron Howard is in it, back in the day when he acted and he does OK too, he doesn't seem to have that much screen time which is good as it isn't just focusing on one person in the story. The entire cast are pretty solid and watch out for a pre Star Wars and Indiana Jones Harrison Ford who even in a pretty minor role, still acts really well in it.George Lucas is the mastermind behind it all, directing and co writing it he does a good job with it all, the script is probably one of if not the best thing about the film with some great word choices and dialogue that kind of draws you in. I enjoyed the set production of the movie, for anyone who lived in these times it could be a massive nostalgic trip back in time, especially if you enjoyed cruising down main street and whistling at every girl you saw.When it comes to criticism, one point for me stands out for me, and that is the music of the film. Now I am not hating on 60's music but the songs are played way too loud and they all sound exactly the same and so for the first half of the movie, I was just annoyed at the music choices. Sometimes I felt it also dragged off just a little bit so that is wasn't that great but it doesn't swerve off the cinema road badly at all.Who to recommend this to?, well I think if I watched it back then I would target youths but even now, the teenagers of today and college students could still watch this and enjoy it all just as the kids of the 70's did. If you enjoy them type of high school Comedy/Drama's then this could really also be for your tastes, however it does feel slightly different to usual ones seeing as it is set in the 60's, and isn't actually all about taking drugs and meeting girls on the street or at parties.Overall it is Solidly a Good movie, some will disagree and say it is great as I have seen many who do, but don't be afraid to dislike parts of it or even not like the film as a whole. I also will say that if you decide to watch this, try to be a bit chilled out whilst doing so as the movie is fast yet slow at times and being comfortable whilst watching it well, you may like the movie much more if you do it that way.",American Graffiti
84,emperor_bender,"""Rome wasn't burned in a night""",10,13 April 2008,"American Graffiti has been a personal favorite for years. I don't know why exactly, I just have always loved this movie and probably always will. George Lucas has created an underrated classic. American Graffiti is overshadowed by Lucas' later pieces including Jaws and Star Wars and Indiana Jones.The cast was picked perfectly. Richard Dreyfuss stars as Curt Henderson, the victim of circumstance and protagonist here, who is questioning college life and looking for the girl in the white T-bird. Ron Howard co-stars as Steve Bolander, the prom king, and popular guy in high school who is leaving with Curt for college in the morning. Paul Le Mat is excellent as John Milner, who is my favorite character. Milner has the fastest car in town and can't seem to outgrow teenage interests and nightlife. Charles Martin Smith plays a great Terry ""the Toad"" Fields, the klutzy, unlucky nerd who tries hard to get some action using Steve's car. The music was excellent. You hear a wide variety of 50's and early 60's rock playing on the radio in the foreground or background. XERB is playing on every car all the time in American Graffiti, with Wolfman Jack as the DJ. There is also a very early appearance by Harrison Ford as Bob Falfa, the mysterious guy driving a 55 Chevy looking to run Milner out of town. With a great cast, an interesting plot, and great music, American Graffiti is a definite classic and does indeed deserve much more praise than it gets. I give it a 10/10. Check it out, you won't be disappointed.",American Graffiti
85,chuck-reilly,"""American Graffiti"" still ranks as the best ""teen"" movie ever",10,30 March 2011,"I noticed one reviewer (from Australia) who just didn't understand why ""American Graffiti"" still has such an impact on audiences. I guess being from another country and continent has its limitations when it comes to understanding America's youth culture. ""American Graffiti"" is a serious movie about an era in American that was about to change forever. Although it's based in 1962, it's really about the end of the 1950s and the Age of Innocence during the Eisenhower years. Vietnam, JFK's assassination and the violence of the 1960s are all just around the corner, and the cast of characters in this film represent the transition. ""American Graffiti"" has many comic overtones and there are plenty of hearty laughs sprinkled throughout the film, but they all serve to mask the seriousness of the main plot which involves the precarious future of the four main leads (Ron Howard, Charles Martin Smith, Paul LeMat and Richard Dreyfuss). Set during one crucial late summer night in a small California town, Steve and Curt (Howard and Dreyfuss) are supposedly leaving in the morning to attend an unnamed Eastern college. There are irresistible forces pulling them to remain; Steve's girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams) and Curt's new fantasy love (Suzanne Somers in a white-hot Thunderbird). Terry the Toad (Smith) is also in the mix as the nerd of the group who just happens to meet the new love of his life in the form of rebellious Debby (Oscar-nonminated Candy Clark). Hot-rodder John Milner (LeMat) is the unacknowledged leader of this quasi-band-of-brothers mainly because he's the tough one of the group and the oldest. The foursome's misadventures all intertwine on this evening with telling results regarding their futures and the paths they have chosen. As the credits unfold at the end, each character's fate is juxtaposed on the screen for the audience to ponder. Their pictures are in the clouds, and like the era they represent, they are soon gone forever.""American Graffiti"" is still arguably director George Lucas' greatest work even if he'll most likely be best remembered for his ""Star Wars"" epics. The movie certainly hit a nerve upon its release in 1973 and is one of the most profitable films in history. The results Lucas attained on his shoestring budget of less than $1 Million will never be duplicated. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Picture and made another fortune upon its re-release several years later. Many of the young actors in the film went on to sterling careers, including Harrison Ford who had a minor part as Milner's nemesis, Bob Falfa. The Rock and Roll soundtrack that accompanied nearly every scene in the film is a classic in its own right, and the songs stick with you long after the final credits roll off the screen. Simply put, ""American Graffiti"" is one of the greatest movies of all time.",American Graffiti
86,Marc_Israel_365,Aways do your best sounds like graduation advise.....,7,13 August 2017,"Nostalgia as entertainment usually fails for me due to era glorification, character generalizing and plots that try too hard. American Graffitti pulled off the triple pleasure of all three of these angles by keeping it simple and true. Our ears were leading the way from car to car from vignette to vignette. The matching song to each story line was both careful and supportive to be authentic without being obvious. the start attractions as viewed decades later is not a fair compliment as in 1973, they were not household names, sans Ronny Howard. That being said, it was a blast of recognition of old friends, sound track of the time, cruising and being teens about the step into adulthood. George Lucas seems to have understood his movie from the beginning quite well and viewers can find solace is the extras that show every actor stating they want to do their best in case anyone ever saw this ""low budget ($750,000"" film. The results are due to the viewer interaction with their pasts on many wonderful levels.",American Graffiti

The theme that holds it together is automobile ""cruising"" going up and down the main street of the town, and hanging out at the local drive-in, in this case, called Mel's.It follows four male friends. Steve (Ron Howard) is the senior class president firm in his determination to head off to college. His girlfriend, Laurie (Cindy Williams) is a little younger and still in school. Steve wants to be free to date other girls, and this creates an evening-long crisis between them. Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) is not sure he wants to go off to college, is currently without a girlfriend, and is at loose ends generally.

He has no desire to leave town. Debbie (Candy Clark) is a blonde ""Valley girl"" who seems fairly clueless but has no trouble getting by on her looks. Carol (Mackenzie Phillips) is a 12-year-old younger sister who tricks her way into cruising around all night with John Milner. Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford) is an out-of-town hot rodder who wants to take on John Milner in a drag race. In the background we hear late 1950s and early 1960s pre-Beatles rock 'n roll, along with the patter of radio DJ Wolfman Jack (played by himself). There also is a mystery blonde woman in a T-Bird (Suzanne Somers) who has caught Curt's eye.Vietnam is not a thing yet; the March on Washington hasn't happened; the Cuban Missile Crisis is a couple months in the future. No one cares who the president of the United States is. These are kids focused on their small-town lives and whether they should try to find a new home away from the home where they already live. There is a climactic ending that leaves some of the kids making different decisions than they first anticipated.Watching it made me feel like a high school sophomore again in 1962, looking at the guys with ducktail hair styles and the packages of smokes in the rolled-up sleeves of their t-shirts.Although Harrison Ford had done some acting prior to ""American Graffiti,"" he had turned to carpentry when he was offered his role in the movie.

I think ""American Graffiti"" is much better than ""Star Wars"" (at least the original 1977 film). I understand why George Lucas is more connected to that than this (""SW"" changed the way films were made, and ""AG""... was about a bunch of teenagers), but this film deserves much better.You all know that it's a story about four teenagers on the last night of summer in 1962. You know about the soundtrack, with Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry and other greats. You know it has Ron Howard and a whole bunch of people with whom you're already familiar. But do you know these things: it has great cinematography, fantastic acting from an ensemble cast with absolutely no weak links, and a perfect sound scheme that blends the dialogue with the music in an interesting and practical fashion-- did you know that?Take it from someone else who *loves* movies-- this is why they exist. It's a movie about love and decision, friendship and fun, about which dreams you have to let go and which dreams you should keep chasing. It's also meant to connect viewers to a bygone era, but never at the expense of the thoroughly human moment. I can say with confidence that ""American Graffiti"" is much better than both ""Happy Days"" and ""Grease"", against which it is constantly measured, and that it remains Lucas's (and one of Coppola's) masterpiece. However, most of the people who like this movie will end up hating the 1979 sequel, but you should still watch it-- it deserves a fair chance.

Richard Dreyfuss provides the intelligence, Ron Howard the aloof personality, Paul LeMat the muscle, and Charles Martin Smith the comic relief as the four main players in director George Lucas' first major breakthrough in movies before his adventure with the 'Star Wars' films began in 1977. 'American Graffiti' and 'Star Wars' are the only truly great films that Lucas has been involved with and 'American Graffiti' is shot like a documentary, edited with care, written with charm and performed with excellence by a cast that will always be remembered for this film that helped them launch careers that would take them to the top of their profession.",American Graffiti
91,smakawhat,Some magic but overall nothing special,6,17 June 2000,"Overall Lucas does a good job capturing the spirit of the early 60's.  I am a big sucker for nostalgia when it comes to movies and Lucas did well.However, the movie which has some great scenes in it, is nothing to scream or be amazed about.  It is low on plot, and the things that happen to some of the main characters (when the movie does decide to focus on them) are pretty ordinary.  The actors do well but there is nothing special in their performances that make them stand out.  Of course people will enjoy this film if they want to pick out all the stars who either made it big (like Harrison Ford) or those who ended up in 70's TV sitcoms.I did enjoy the movie but not immensely..Rating 6 out of 10.",American Graffiti
92,Hermit C-2,Lucas' REAL work of genius.,10,23 June 1999,"You can have all the 'Star Wars' movies, Episodes One through whatever; I'll trade them all straight up for 'American Graffiti' and consider myself as having got the best end of the deal.This was only Lucas' second major film as a director (though he was already plenty experienced at filmmaking) and it is extraordinary. 'AG' chronicles one long night in the lives of some recent high school graduates in a north California in 1962. But it's not just a look at the teenage ritual of cruising. By the time the next day is dawning, the main characters have all learned lessons about life and themselves and glimpsed the directions their futures will go in.A group of talented young actors form the core of the large cast in this film. Ronny Howard, as he's billed here, pulls off the formidable task of turning in a performance that makes one forget about his past as a well-known child actor from a popular TV show. He plays Steve, an All-American boy eager to enter the new world of college, which means leaving home. He talks with his girlfriend Laurie (Cindy Williams) about how their relationship might change now that they're both soon to be worldly adults. Perhaps they should consider seeing other people. Fighting ensues between the two, causing Laurie to at least temporarily abandon him for another cruiser, one in whom she has no interest whatsoever.Steve's good friend Curt likes to have a good time too, but he's also a sensitive budding writer. His great ambition is to shake JFK's hand. But he's having his doubts this evening about going away to college, something Steve can hardly believe he's hearing. He spends the night getting mixed up with a local gang and chasing a fantasy woman he sees at a stoplight. Another friend, Terry (or ""Toad""), played by Charlie Martin Smith, is in heaven this evening. This Vespa-driving, awkward bumbler is to be entrusted with Steve's fine automobile while he's away. In it he picks up a fast girl with a bit of a reputation who under normal circumstances he'd never have a chance with. The group is rounded out by Big John Milner (Paul Le Mat), king of the cruisers who can outrun all challengers in his rod. But this local legend is once again going to be left behind by another group of high-school grads while he cruises the same strip.There are also several other fine supporting performances, led by a young Mackenzie Phillips as a 13-year old who gets pawned off on Big John. Bo Hopkins also shines as the leader of the small-time local gang, the Pharaohs. Also seen here are Harrison Ford and Kathy (Kathleen) Quinlan in their pre-star days. (After the success of 'Star Wars' Lucas added a couple of more minutes of Ford to a new cut of this movie.) In addition, Suzanne Somers, ""the girl in the white T-Bird,"" has one of the most effective cameo roles in Hollywood history.All the actors mentioned are good ones, but they all benefit from Lucas' guidance. The film is enlivened by a knowledgeable choice of period rock & roll which serves as a pervasive but unobtrusive backdrop for the action. The conclusion wraps things up beautifully as we get a taste of what will happen to these characters we've come to care so much about in this short time. George Lucas may have made films with more flash and more popular appeal, but none has more heart and soul than 'American Graffiti,' a true classic of American cinema.",American Graffiti
93,PeterRoeder,Awesome,8,14 August 2008,"I saw this yesterday, and I thought it was great. I am a big fan of Lucas' art, and I think Indy 4 was the best movie of the year. I had been looking forward to seeing his first major picture, and it really was great. The use of 60s music is just awesome. After the first half hour I was mesmerized like I had been sucked into another world. We can really get to know all the characters like it was our own friends, and the story is certainly excellent getting all the pieces together in the end with a very touching ending. Look out for Harrison Ford and Richard Dreyfuss in early roles. There are also a lot of references to American Graffiti in Indy 4, by the way. I will not mention them here, but it is obvious that you can draw references to other projects by Lucas - even to the computer game Maniac Mansion which also portrays a lot of young people who are quite similar to the characters of American Graffiti.",American Graffiti
94,bix171,A Family Of Innovators,10,11 June 2003,"The striking visuals and sound collage point to the collaborative genius of director George Lucas who had the good sense to involve brilliant stylists (here, editors Verna Fields and Marcia Lucas, sound recorder Walter Murch, and Haskell Wexler, listed as `visual consultant', though the cinematography is credited to Jan D'Alquen and Ron Eveslage) and the immensely talented professionals working in harmony gives you the feeling of watching a lovingly creative family as they innovate. Lucas and co-scenarists Gloria Katz and Willard Huyck have fashioned a sweet-tempered ode to the end of adolescence as played out on the last night of summer vacation for Camelot-era high school graduates planning diverging life paths in the morning; they precisely capture the rueful melancholy and idealism that teenagers about to step into the void feel and combine them with a graceful slapstick that makes the touching symbolism easy to identify with. The performances are equally inspired, from Richard Dreyfuss' sensitive confliction to Paul Le Mat's easygoing charm infused with despondency to Ron Howard's all-around nice guy/pushover and Charles Martin Smith's painful grabs at acceptance. It's a film with a male point of view but this time around, that's not a bad thing--there's a naïve misunderstanding of women that seems deliberate and affectionately wrong-headed and it dovetails perfectly with the overall wistful sense of young aimlessness. The soundtrack alone makes this worth seeing. Toni Basil did the choreography, most notably a memorable sock hop that takes up an early portion of the picture. Whatever drubbing Lucas has taken since `Star Wars', at least he can point with pride to this critical Seventies masterpiece.",American Graffiti
95,Herag,Chrome&Neon Classic,7,8 December 2004,"Someone nostalgic for diners,chrome and neon in general,this will suffice. It is rather disappointing not because it came from George Lucas, who went to fame and fortune with the Star-Wars Trilogy. This movie was made on a limited budget in Petulama CA, where the hamburgers and shakes were skated to the hHotrod classics from a neon diner. George Lucas, was never a director to portray the characters like Coppola would have done. In fact this movie was offered to Coppola to produce, but he opted out for credit and percentage. A movie produced for a $2 million went on to fetch more than $7 million for George Lucas.There would have never been ""Star-wars"" if it not for this movie. Yes, this movie is a classic for its times, as much as ""Saturday Night Fever"", was for the jaywalking disco-dancer in New york, but if you compare it to the the Godfather,Bugsy,Goodfellas,this movie is all-chrome no glitter. What made the movie a moneymaker and a success was the splendid cast that was handpicked by Coppola,Kurtz and Lucas. They were all fresh, with budding talent that emerged into great careers and it was evident with Dreyfuss. The movie is nostalgic for the the era but hyped for today's standards.",American Graffiti
96,Darkest_Rose,"Where were you, in '62?",8,2 December 2002,"This movie is about several high school graduates driving around in their cars  the whole night looking to cause trouble.

I would give American Graffiti 8.5/10",American Graffiti
97,TheHande,Another great film from a young George Lucas,10,15 January 2008,"A period youth drama set against a virtually non-existent plot would seem a little thin to go by, luckily the brilliant direction, appropriate music and sympathetic actors make American Graffiti an undying classic. Like THX-1138 before it, it possesses a kind of innocence and purity that Lucas' post Star Wars films perhaps lacked.What the film does best is have brilliantly varied cast of characters and several good plot lines going around simultaneously. As for the drama side of things it's really difficult to compare it with a more traditional adventure film like Star Wars and it's really not entirely comparable with the more esoteric and artistic THX.The point I'm striving for is that I'm a person who isn't the biggest fan of period pictures, I don't like drama and I especially hate teen-flicks. While this film fills the criteria for all three I was able to watch it without getting bored. Watching the movie is a brilliant experience and should not be missed by anyone.",American Graffiti
98,lib-4,"Rock and roll, cars and cruising",8,14 June 1999,"This movie is set in the same year I graduated, so the music and the mood all fit to a tee.

This was the time before Vietnam so life was really music, school and romance.. and Lucas captures it perfectly.",American Graffiti
99,coolantic,They Never Lock Up Their Cars!,9,11 May 2020,"Just watched this again on the Sony Movie Channel,and really enjoyed it. A bit surreal in a way. It was nostalgia for me, having first seen it in 1973. But the film itself is a homage to the late fifties/early sixties.
No apologies. What makes this film are the cars and the music. Having been born at the start of the fifties, I was only eleven at the time being portrayed in the movie. Thus, although being aware of the music; I was unable to appreciate it fully until AG brought it to the big screen. That opening sequence featuring Rock Around The Clock made me and my missus want to jive in the aisle. The narratives were almost inconsequential. Simply a backdrop to the avalanche of one great song after another; rock and roll, doo-wop, close harmony, they were all here. Presided over by the mysterious DJ, Wolfman Jack. And for the eyes, an endless parade of brightly coloured, chromed, style-exaggerated icons of American automobilia. The story, such as it is, concerns the activities of a group of friends in a small town on the last night before two of them, Curt and Steve, depart for college. Curt is having second thoughts and goes off by himself after a fleeting encounter with a beautiful blonde in a Thunderbird. However, he gets 'kidnapped' by a street gang who involve him in their delinquent doings. Meanwhile Steve and girlfriend Laurie ponder the consequences of being parted, and fall out. Bespectacled nerd Terry has been given custody of Steve's car, and uses it to pick up easy-going Debbie. Spinning her tale after tale about his fictitious wealthy lifestyle. During a hoped-for romantic encounter in the woods, Terry suddenly realises that the car has been stolen. Small wonder when no-one in this film ever bothers to lock their car door when leaving it parked! The oldest member of the group John Milner, is the local drag-racing champ. He's cool, but gets landed with 13 year-old Carol. Much to his embarrassment. However, just like the gunfighters of the Old West, John must deal with rivals. In this instance it is one Bob Falfa (played by a youthful Harrison Ford) and his 'mean fifty-five Chevy'.
All the stories reach some kind of conclusion. Curt makes contact with his blonde via a radio appeal courtesy of Wolfman Jack, and decides he will go to college. Terry and Debbie find Steve's car, but when Steve suddenly wants it back, he has to tell Debbie the truth. Incredibly, she doesn't care! And admits to having had a good time, agreeing to see Terry again.
Milner, takes on Falfa in a race. Laurie has ended up in Falfa's car and Steve is rushing to get to her. Milner wins the race when the Chevy goes off the road, and Steve rescues Laurie from the overturned car. He realises he cannot leave her. Despite having won the race Milner has to admit that he was trailing the Chevy until the accident. Will he be champ for much longer?
The film ends with Curt's departure. But, before the credits roll we are given brief on-screen notes as to the fates of the main characters. I won't add further spoilers but simply recommend that you see this fantastic film for yourselves.",American Graffiti
100,cgearheart,Where were you in '62?,10,13 June 2019,"From the Director of Star Wars comes an iconic, nostalgic, exciting, and even touching film that's almost as much of a surprise hit as the titular space opera.
What I feel really separates this film from Star Wars (besides the fact that they're two totally different films), is that George Lucas established a very absorbing story with a colorful array of emotions and characters, something he isn't known very well for. On top of that, it's a love story, and a very good one; another strong suit Lucas isn't known for.
The film to me is proof that even though George's notoriety will always be stuck in the shadow of Star Wars, this film is really the cornerstone of his career. Not that it's better than ""a galaxy far, far, away"" (but darn close), but due to the fact that this established that George could make impressive films on a minuscule budget and with the help of friends.A",American Graffiti

102,kyle-cruse,Hilarious nostalgic comedy,10,22 August 2008,"One of my personal favorites of all time, ""American Graffiti"" proves to be one of the most hilarious and entertaining films I've ever seen. With no real plot, it gives us nothing more than an inside look at a 1960s graduating high school class's last night cruising the town before officially becoming adults. Although they are probably just a little exaggerated, we probably laugh at most of the material in this film because we know how funny it could be if it happened in real life. Ron Howard, Charles Martin Smith, and Richard Dreyfuss were all excellent as some of the film's main starts. The film also features a young Harrison Ford (before he proved himself to be a good actor). There's not much to say about this film, since the laughs come from a bunch of simply random elements of the film. Perhaps it's each characters reaction to each situation that makes the film so fun to watch. The ending adds a small touch of drama and sadness to the film, but the movie is a far greater portion of comedy than the latter. What a masterpiece directed by a pre-Star Wars George Lucas. ""American Graffiti"" is one of the most enjoyable films ever made. Not the Best Picture of 1973 (that was rightfully earned by ""The Sting"") Nevertheless, this one is not to be missed.**** out of ****",American Graffiti
103,erwan_ticheler,Classic Rock 'n Roll High School/Road movie,9,14 December 2002,"What makes American Graffiti so special is the way that the music is combined with the dialogues,almost non-stop.Classics like Rock around the clock,That 'll be the day,I only have eyes for you and Green onions(!) are heard sometimes loud and sometimes in the back ground while the actors talk or the engines of the cars roar. Another special thing about this film is the legendary cast and crew,although not yet at that moment.The movie is directed by George Lucas before(Star Wars was yet to be made),it is produced by Francis Ford Coppola(one year after he made the Godfather).And then the actors:Ron Howard(Richie Cunningham from Happy Days and academy award winning director for A Beautiful Mind),Richard Dreyfuss(Matt Hooper from Jaws),Charles Martin Smith(the accountant from The Untouchables) and the one and only Wolfman Jack playing Wolfman Jack.Other important parts are for Paul LeMat as the greatest dragracer in the universe,Bo Hopkins as a gang leader(he dies in the first scene of The Wild Bunch) and Cindy Williams as Howards girl(she also played in some episodes of Happy Days).Candy Clark got an oscar nomination for her role as the beautiful Debbie. But the biggest surprise in this movie comes from the great and legendary Harrison Ford(my favorite actor) as Bob Falfa,a drag racing sort of bad guy. All these famous actors in their early days makes it extra special, because in these days this cast and crew would be all-star! The car scenes are beautiful,it is a pity that the don't make these cars anymore.Some scenes are very funny(the liquor store scene for instance)and some are very emotional. With all this the story is not bad either and the ending is pretty surprising too.Don't go away before the movie is truly ended,because then you see what happens with the characters in the future.(why,Toad, why!?)PS:buy the 2-disc soundtrack,it is absolutely great,the final song is a great cut:All summer long from the Beach Boys.it is not heard in the movie,what a shame.I'm gonna listen Green Onions once again! 10/10",American Graffiti

Excellent cinematography and a splendid cast of youthful actors. Richard Dreyfuss was never better as the wannabe writer. Candy Clark deserved a Supp. Actress Oscar as Debbie, the flirty fun girl. Cindy Williams was never lovelier or more believable. Paul LeMat embodies the 50's with his ""James Dean"" type. Mackenzie Phillips was never more natural and amusing. Charlie Martin Smith is a crackup and deserved an Oscar nod. This is also one of the few times Harrison Ford was interesting as an actor, albeit in a small role. A 10 out of 10. Best performance = Candy Clark. A 24-hour time span is covered and the locations are authentic. A great film! Now that Lucas seems to be a toy manufacturer it's a shame.",American Graffiti
105,patryk-czekaj,A great coming of age story,8,14 June 2012,"A few years before Star Wars, George Lucas directed American Graffiti. And it was good. I mean, really good. I probably haven't seen a more realistic and engaging movie about teenagers. In comparison to most of the other teen flicks that are really nothing but a bunch of silly comedies without any deeper sense, American Graffiti actually has a point and it's put out on the table very clearly. Because of the marvelous atmosphere and a truly superb soundtrack (so many fabulous songs played throughout, accompanied by one funky DJ's comment and jokes) I wished that I could turn back time and be a teenager in one of the American cities in the 60's era.This coming of age tale shows the one-night journeys of a group of boys, strolling around the glistening roads of Modesto. Two of them, Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard), are about to go to college back east in the morning. The first one is having some second thoughts about this big life-changing decision, while the second is really glad that he will have a chance to make a change and study someplace else. Along with John (Paul Le Mat) and Terry (Charles Martin Smith) they experience a bunch of crazy, funny and very entertaining adventures. Every one of them does something that he probably wouldn't be able to do on a totally different night of the year. This is the one occasion that lets them do whatever they feel like doing, without any regrets. All the drinking, fighting, fooling around, stealing, picking up girls, making love - it feels like there would be no tomorrow. And in that one special night some individuals can go through a sudden transition, just to realize what they truly want in the first place.George Lucas showed, obviously not for the last time, that his directorial skills are on the highest level. Not many directors would be able to present the overall complex and very peculiar sensations that young people are going through in such a truthful manner. The viewer can reminisce about his teenage years and relate to all the issues and emotions that the characters exhibit on screen.All of the four main actors are simply marvelous and really convincing. Richard Dreyfuss is great as a guy, who spends the whole night looking for that one pretty girl, and eventually engages in some risky pranks with a gang trio. Ron Howard as a boy, who deals with some girlfriend problems, and ultimately understands that true happiness is right in front of him. Paul Le Mat's adorable James Dean impersonation makes him look like a handsome and tough guy, with all the catchy taunts and car races. And the last, but probably the funniest and the coolest one – Terry (played by the amazing Charles Martin Smith), a nerdy guy who finds out that spending an amazing night with a cute girl could be easier than he thought.All in all, American Graffiti is a splendid teen movie that is actually both funny and serious, and presents the problems of the youth in an utmost believable way. Everyone, who ever had to go trough this troubling period in a life called 'growing up', has to see this film, as it shows that the years of fun and freedom aren't always exactly what they seem like.",American Graffiti
106,dataconflossmoor,Let's be the way we are not going to be anymore for just one more night!!,10,11 September 2002,"American Graffiti was a compilation of pop culture pique, a harbinger of political changes, and the birth of an era that explodes the ""Leave it to Beaver America"" simply by saying farewell to it!!!...Set in a small town in Southern California, with a bunch of people who's existence in 1962 means the 13th and final year of the fifties, it correlates a cosmic awareness with an innocent societal disagreement.... People are happy, but not happy enough to want to stay the same.... The constant bond throughout the film is Wolfman Jack, the ""supercool"" disc jockey who creates a thousand different images of himself just by virtue of what he says on the radio...He is illuminating as well as socially influential to a bunch of naive teenagers....The music in this movie is extremely entertaining, as it signifies the end of an Eisenhower style Utopia.. The couples that are paired off in this movie homogenize the attitudes and aspirations of these precocious 1962 teenagers, who are on the verge of growing up!! All of the characters in this film have an imperviousness to the objections related to a perceived totalitarianism brought on in the sixties, not just because the radical aspect of the decade has yet to be, but also, because locking horns with the authority figures is not second nature to them ...(Even Big John Milner)... The bevy of Radicalism which besieges our nation over the remainder of this decade, (the 1960's) created a metamorphosis in social behavior that would change all Americans, even the people living in the town of Graffit, California!!! This movie superbly exemplifies the phrase ""The calm before the storm"" It gives the entire movie audience a crystal ball concept analysis report that sparks a bittersweet realization and empathy for everyone who plays a significant role in this George Lucas masterpiece!!

107,caseynicholson,A Well Made Coming of Age Movie,8,2 June 2016,"I was fortunate to get to catch this 1973 classic in an old theater in my hometown recently during a street festival with a cruise in later that evening. I had never seen ""American Graffiti"", and aside from having heard that Ron Howard was in it and that it had some muscle cars in it, I knew very little about the film. I was presently surprised with how much I enjoyed it.The movie is written and directed by George Lucas of Star Wars fame, just a few years before ""A New Hope"" hit screens in 1976. The film tells the tale of a group of teenagers in the 1950's--most of them recent high school graduates--on their last night in town before school starts back for some and others will be going off to college the next day. The film is replete with 50's era culture, from muscle cars to drive-ins and packs of cigarettes rolled up in the sleeves of white t-shirts.This movie is both fun and yet also has a serious undertone. It watches a bit like a cleaner version of ""Porky's"", and certainly has a sophomoric element to it--albeit one that doesn't cross the lewd line that a ""Porky's"" or an ""Animal House"" does (though it comes close at times).The car scenes are quite fun, as is the adolescent romance that plays out for several characters as the night goes along. Still, at the film's closing scene you realize that the film's title is a poignant one, as these young people's lives themselves serve as the graffiti of the American saga.All in all I'm giving this movie 8/10 stars. It's a fine film with good acting and a fun script.",American Graffiti

109,teh_mode,The Precendent Of Teen Movies,8,25 April 2006,"Before someone decided to give George Lucas a wad of money and heaps of technology, the grand-daddy of Hollywood blockbusters made his cut with early classics such as this 60s themed teen comedy. Featuring the niftiest cars, the grooviest music and a whole host of stars-to-be American Graffiti set obvious movie trends, stemming from earlier works such as Rebel Without A Cause (one of the characters is obviously a James Dean clone) that would be followed up by later classics of the genre such as Amy Heckerling's Fast Times At Ridgemount High and Richard Linklater's Dazed & Confused. Stylishly shot Lucas' film certainly looks the part, capturing the best that the late 50s and early 60s had to offer. Among the film's wide arrange of wonderful sites are the central diner, where all the waitresses serve you on skates and cars pull up in the parking-lot style drive-in, ordering through the ever-muffled microphone. All the characters listen to the same radio station, operated by the enigmatic ""Wolfman"" almost offering a chorus to the film's many intertwining plots and narratives. A lot of the narrative is told from the cars, ranging from John Milner (Paul Le Mat)'s Ford Coupe racer to Bob Falfa (Harrison ford)'s '55 Chevy. Characters will talk to each other on the road, either cruising for dates or swapping the dirt on other people. IT keeps the story interesting and entertaining. Not to mention making it look better. Some of the cameos are wonderful: checkout Harrison Ford's racer cowboy Bob Falfa, who is constantly on the coattails of John Milner, goading him about his racing skills. Stylish, funny with a serious edge beneath the colour American Graffiti may not be as revered as many of it's predecessors, but certainly holds enough style, groove and set-pieces to make every bit as watchable today as it was in 1971.",American Graffiti

111,bannonanthony,A brilliant teen movie!,7,18 November 2002,"I recently saw this film on video, and I have to say I wasn't disappointed. George Lucas was just four years away from making STAR WARS and here he shows what a great storyteller/director he already was. It was apparently based on Lucas' own teen days. I watched it this film with my brother and when I mentioned that fact he stated that Lucas was probably the nerd, like Terry the Toad. That sounds reasonable. I was glad that Terry got himself a girlfriend though.It's great how the different plots with each character are examined in great detail. Over the space of one night, the characters get into various different adventures. I liked the bits with hot-rodder John Milner, owner of 'the fastest car in the Valley' as he befriends a frustrated twelve-year old whom he is tricked into giving a ride to. Richard Dreyfuss spends most of the film trying to find a mysterious blonde beauty who drives a white Thunderbird, and falls in with a bad crowd as he does so. But he escapes the gang and, with the help of DJ Wolfman Jack, he gets his life in order. The performances are all great. Mackenzie Phillips is initially annoying as the twelve-year old, but becomes sympathetic when she tells Milner what her home life is like. A young Harrison Ford appears as an up and coming drag racer who challenges Milner to a race. He doesn't have much to do, but we can already see shades of Han Solo in him. Both Ford's Chevy and MIlner's Deuce Coupe are the kind of cars you'd kill for. Bottom line: American GRAFFITI is a classic, not to be missed!",American Graffiti
112,StevenKeys,American Graffiti,10,5 July 2020,"Not a coming-of-age film as it's often tabbed, except that it made Lucas his first million, Coppola his 2nd ($777K > 140M). Rather, this is a 'goodbye' movie that warmly depicts the eventful, final nite of innocent frolic between high school friends, all chaperoned by one of the early, great compilation soundtracks, one last ride around the circuit before they part ways, before reality sets in and before America's upheavel in coup d'état (11-22-63 Dallas), war (Vietnam), more national grief (MLK - RFK) and one grand entrance by The-Beatles to kick-off the British Invasion at JFK Airport, Feb 7, 1964.When George's name is mentioned, most think of his Star Wars franchise and the billions it's produced for the Modesto, CA native (AG setting). Not this critic. I try not to think of that stiff, sci-fi series with its empty calories. I think of this film, his glittering gem with all its joy (Joe: ""Rome wudn't burnt in a day!""), the coolest drag-race that pits John 'Ready-Teddy' Milner (LeMat)"" against Bob 'Nobody' Falfa (Ford) and maybe the most moving moment of melancholy to close out a feature. For some people, change comes hard. New seasons are met with trepidation, fading phases gone too soon. If you hate to see summer end, you can still give it a big bear-hug goodbye when taking in Lucas-Katz-Huyck-Coppola's masterpiece in music, motorsport & memories (4/4).",American Graffiti

For many, the teen years are a two sided coin, for many it's their best, and for others it's their worst, and this movie captures the ups and downs of that time period in our lives perfectly following a group of guys on one night. From finding love, enjoying themselves, making amends, cruising around, brawling, getting into and out of trouble w ith the law and so on, this has all that covered. I like how George Lucas captures the feel of the 60's with classic rock songs playing in the background, nice touch. It's amazing just how much gets covered in one night. Great casting choices of Richard Dreyfuss, Paul Lamatt, and Wolfman Jack himself. You can watch this once, twice, it gets better with every viewing!",American Graffiti
114,possumopossum,Where Were You in 1962?,9,3 March 2007,"I was in the second grade. Or just about to start the second grade in the summer of 1962. But this reminds me of my own high school years (I graduated in 1975). I can truly identify with Curt. I didn't want to leave high school because I was kind of the ""big man"" in town. I was also chasing phantom girls, maybe not blondes in T-birds, but I was a hopeless romantic. It was eerie. It was as if George Lucas had looked over my shoulder and wrote my life's story in that movie.Yes, folks, this is George Lucas before STAR WARS, and this is another darn good story he wrote. This movie makes you want to laugh and cry at the same time. Anyone who has ever lived through that period will cry over times and places lost forever. Even though I was very young, I remember that time period well, so much so that I want to freeze frame it and go back to it knowing what I do now. And George Lucas gives us a poignant, sometimes funny, sometimes painful look at the last summer of our innocence, before Viet Nam, before political assassinations, and before everything just went into a tailspin. The little pictures and captions at the end kind of wake you up to reality, like a slap of cold water in the face.",American Graffiti
115,jbartelone,Great Music Cannot Save Mediocre Story,6,13 November 2008,"There is SOME good chemistry to American Graffiti, and that is its awesome 60's soundtrack. It makes the viewer really experience the drive-in's, malt shops, cruising the streets, and looking for romance in the time period. Great stars like Harrison Ford, Ron Howard, and Charles Martin Smith round out the cast in a ""before they were stars"" ensemble that make the movie worth seeing.....once.See American Graffiti for the music and the cinematography that really captures the essence of teens growing up in the 60's. However, the movie has a huge problem. In trying to follow all of the little plots and subplots about the characters, the viewer does not draw a sense of emotional attachment to them. The script is ambiguous as if the producers said, ""Let's do some research on what teens did on those 1960's summer nights, take a group of five or so unknown actors (at the time) and put cameras on them forcing them to act and react to the time period around them. The music tries so very, very, hard to make this film a nostalgic classic. However, the problem is that these main characters don't have anything special to say or do. Their lives are almost too ordinary, reflected around a time of social, economic, political change, and turmoil.There are several opportunities for the film to take on more serious tones. But the quality actors are forced into soap-opera type situations of romance, drinking, and cruising. The talents of these actors was not necessary for this movie because the story is so basic, ""Teens cruise California post-high school graduation looking for fun, sex, and booze before leaving for college."" That's American Graffiti in a nutshell. The pacing is S-L-O-W. However, a surprising (shocking) ending to some will make viewers think. Unfortunately, it appears that this moment was tacked onto the film for emotional impact. The problem is it comes too late in the film to care. The soundtrack is the best part of this movie.",American Graffiti
116,Filmdokter,A delicious 2h sixties music video,8,15 February 2021,"The title of this review is no sarcasm and should be read as a compliment. American Graffiti is a love letter from George Lucas to his days as a teenager in the early sixties. And what a love letter it is! An easy breezy film (with a somewhat downbeat ending that signals the darker days of that decade that have yet to come) that is loaded with typical American iconography of those days. But what really is the joy of this film, is the score: one classic rock 'n roll or surf pop song after the other. It's a great night out. Just like it used to be.",American Graffiti
117,emryse,I Assume A Perfect Encapsulation of the Times,7,6 April 2021,"This film is set other one night and follows a group of kids, just left school on their adventures round town. The cast is full with people who would later become stars and the cinematography is pretty solid, but where this film excels, is how it manages to capture the feel of an entire generation and a time so perfectly, the cars, the music, trying to buy alcohol, trying to impress girls. This movie perfectly captures how I imagine life was in America during the early 60s and almost makes me sad I couldn't have grown up back then. It brings you back to a simpler time in a way that not many other films have and I think that makes this film one everyone should try and watch.",American Graffiti
118,DavidAllenUSA,American Graffiti (1973 Universal) Showed Boom Time 50's As The 70's Bust Began,5,22 November 2010,"American Graffiti (1973 Universal) is a nostalgia movie about the 1950's done ""on the cheap"" with mediocre actor performances and mediocre writing, but held together with the glue of ""Top Of The Pops Chart"" songs from the middle 1950's and a motif of ""cruising 50's cars of fame"" (Edsels, Mid-50's Chevys, big Cadillacs, Corvettes, even a Studebaker with an engine hood shaped like a bullet).George Lucas directed and wrote the screenplay, and also introduced later superstar Harrison Ford in the role of ""Bob Falfa,"" a one dimensional stud type Harrison Ford continued to play for the next 40 years with great commercial (but no artistic) success. Bruce Willis and later Calif. Governor Arnold Schwartzenegger both did the same, as the 1973 Calif. Governor Ronald Reagan had also during his movie star years....one dimensional crowd pleaser stud types.Nostalgia part of the movie includes gas stations manned by service attendants who actually pumped gas for customers not required to leave their cars, and fast food hamburger stands where service staff visited cars with trays of tasty, individually prepared food at low prices. Pretty girl waitresses wearing sexy short skirts and roller skates.American Graffiti (1973) was set in a small city in central California, not quite rural, but not LA or San Francisco and/or environs, either. People in the movie were ""rubes"" and painfully naive, and supposed to be likable for those reasons.We see four teen ager couples each depicted in alternating sequences, two well acted and interesting (well written script work), two badly acted and boring (bad script work).Actors Paul LeMat and MacKensie Phillips steal the movie with a portrayal of a 12 year old ""underaged"" (sort of) girl and a perpetual teen ager type early twenties boy long ago dropped out of high school who meet and spend several hours ""cruising"" around the downtown area of the California small city where the movie takes place. These two are innocent and impudent and the best actors in the movie. Writing for their sequences is also the best in the movie.The young girl is played by MacKensie Phillips who went on to become a famous television star (her father was John Phillips of The Mamas And The Papas 1960's singing group).The James Dean type boy is played by Paul LeMat, who sadly did not become a big movie star after this movie and his great performance. Too bad for movie audiences because he had star quality and a character wonderful to behold.The John Milner character in American Graffiti (1973 Universal) was as good as the Rick Blaine ""Bogie"" character in Casablanca (1943 Warner Brothers) starring Humphrey Bogart. The Milner character was a noble, but alienated man, interesting, intelligent, and fiercely independent.LeMat's ""John Milner"" character could have become as famous as Humphrey Bogart's ""Bogie"" character had it been recognized and managed well ....but that didn't happen.Instead, we got More American Graffiti (1979) as a very bad follow up movie, and LeMat's character was never heard from again..American Graffiti (1973 Universal) is OK in many ways.....not wonderful, but a fun mediocre movie showing off fun mediocre aspects of mass USA culture of past times.It's for people like me who were kids when Elvis and James Dean were young....now we're all eligible for Social Security pensions.------------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

119,rdukeesq,a classic with a classic soundtrack,8,7 August 2011,"So I watched George Lucas's 1973 film American graffiti. Well was it a classic, well yeah why not. Let me start by saying that a movie watched in 2010 from 11973, that takes place in the early 1960's can throw a person off but having a memorable cast helps. Lets face it the movie has Han Solo before he was Han Solo Mr. Harrison Ford, one of today's biggest directors, Mr Richie Cunningham, I mean Opie Taylor, I mean Ron Howard, and the still relevant but barely Richard Dreyfus. It also has a pre incestuous relationship Mckenzie Phillips (or possibly not yuck!), Shirley from Laverne and Shirley, and Suzanne Sommers. What did it for me about this movie more than anything else was both the basic story of boys at the precipice of manhood, and the soundtrack that for oldies were far more golden than moldy. I likes this flick and don't see why kids of today wouldn't enjoy it if they gave it a chance. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",American Graffiti
120,bergma15@msu.edu,Probably Lucas' best film as a Director,9,24 March 2006,"I can't recall the first time I saw this movie. It is still one of my dad's favorite movies and he's always had a copy (be it on VHS or on laser-disc, yeah he's had it that long). I guess you might say that I grew up with this movie. I rented it recently, mainly because of the nostalgic value it has for me, but remembered why I enjoyed it so much. This film is pure Americana and represents an era of American innocence. George Lucas really took some risks on this one. He made a film about cruising in the early 70s (an era that was marked by down beat films). I have to say that when Lucas was young, he had balls.The plot is extremely simple (but I still hope that I can do it justice). Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard) have graduated from high school in southern California and are headed out east to go to college (the whole film takes place on the last night that they're in town). Their friends are Terry the Toad, the geek (Charles Martin Smith), and John Milner (the best driver in the valley, played by Paul Le Mat). The story follows the four as they cruise around town. Curt is worried about leaving town and decides he may not want to leave.Curt starts cruising with Steve and Laurie (Curt's sister, Steve's girlfriend)he sees a blonde in a white T-Bird, who becomes his obsession for the night after she mouths ""I love you"" to him. Curt goes from being with Steve and Laurie to cruising with his ex-girlfriend, to being abducted by a car gang, to finally finding disc jockey Wolfman Jack to play a song for the blonde in a white T-Bird.Steve decides to break up with Laurie because he's going off to college. Laurie takes it very badly (of course) and the two go through the ups and downs about their relationship through the night.Steve lent Terry the Toad his car for safe keeping while he's out of town. Toad cruises around and eventually picks up Debbie (Candy Clark) who normally would be way out of his league. The two get into several bizarre situations (including a liquor store hold up and having Steve's car stolen).John ends up having to drive around with Carol (who is probably about 13) after some girls who are cruising play a trick on him. John and Carol definitely have a love/hate relationship, but John tries to look out for Carol. John is being chased by Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford) who wants to beat him in a drag race.The separate stories all tie in due to the friendship shared between the four. Ultimately, the story is about going away and remembering the good times that everyone has when they're young. The epilogue really puts this theme in perspective. The film really could have been made about any period, but the fact that it was made about the last great period of American innocence really drives the point home that it is a film about growing up and changing. Granted, Lucas grew up during this period and was into cruising, but the setting is still essential to the theme of the movie. This period is coming to a close, for the characters because they're moving on and because of the events that would happen in the 60s. The setting is 1962. However, as I have previously stated, the film is not merely a period piece because the themes involved are timeless.I recommend for anyone.",American Graffiti

122,RMS1949,Average movie but great music.,5,18 July 2017,"The film itself was pretty bland. While it was suppose to be just a slice of life about teenagers getting ready to go off into their college days, the actors all seemed more like people who were in their mid 20's.. And when I check the birth days of many of the stars in it, I was right,, many in their mid 20's ,, hell, Harrison Ford was 30 when this was made. Just seemed weird. Best thing about it was the cars and of course the music. A potpourri of great late 50's and early 60's hits. Maybe it was novel at the time it came out, today it just looks cheesy, miscast and worst of all, boring..",American Graffiti
123,tstudstrup,Boring.,1,30 October 2018,"I dont know what the big deal is about this movie. I really dont. I only saw it to see Harrison Ford in one of his first parts. He was in the movie for a total of maybe 8 minutes.I dont know if this is considered a classic, because George Lucas directed it and the performmances are good. And George Lucas has later on become famous in part for not knowing how to direct actors.Besides from the nice cars and the cool diner and the cool music, the story is boring and I dont really care about any of the characters. Richard Dreyfuss is fat and annoying. And Ron Howard has hair and he is also annoying. Oh and the short guy from The Untouchables is in it*SPOILER AHEAD*This is suppose to be their last night together, before they all go off to college, but they dont spend the night together. So what's the point?And there is the cool guy that picks up a much younger girl, drives aroun with her all night. And in the moring he races Foirds character. Ford crashes his car and survives.Ron Howards character is excited to get out of the small town. Fat Dreyfuss is not sure. In the end he leaves and Howards character stays, because his annoying girlfriend dont want him to leave her.Boring movie that would have bombed at the boxoffice, had it been made today.",American Graffiti
124,nhlgumby,American Graffiti,7,17 May 2006,"I have to agree with my film professor when he claims this movie is George Lucas' best film. The story is so tight it's hermetically sealed. Four friends after graduation are only one night away from leaving each other to go on with the remainder of their lives. It's up to them to decide if they're ready to go yet or not. What makes this movie appealing to many is its soundtrack. Taking clips from the top 40 charts of the 1960's and placing it alongside hot rodding muscle cars really sets this movie in a period and truly asks you the question on the poster ""where were you in '62?"" Again, this is the kind of solid movie-making that allows the director/writer to go on and do whatever else they want to do in the industry. It's like a golden ticket into the studio system, and for Lucas it was his chance to rebound from the failure of THX-1138 and get back on his feet to make Star Wars. After that it's the gravy train and as many remasters of your movie as you want to make because people are going to buy it, no matter how many times you jerk them around. O, Lucas, how thou art what thou despised as a film student. Picked this up at the University library.",American Graffiti
125,flimbuff,AN AMERICAN CLASSIC,10,13 April 2002,"Just one of the finest films ever made. A must for every baby boomer even if you weren't born in California. It is just a mixed story of teenagers coming of age in the 60s set to a wonderful score that epitomizes the times. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. An ensemble cast headed by Dreyfuss and Howard with wonderful appearances by all, especially the unheralded Paul LeMat. Don't blink or you'll miss Suzanne Somers' legs and you won't forget them either.",American Graffiti
126,Pyro_Pizza,Nostalgia or Bust,4,10 February 2021,"The film itself is well made. It's got good acting, and is well shot. My main problem with this is the story. There's not really one, the film just cuts from scene to scene of people cruising around the 60s each with there own mini plot. It feels like a 60s sitcom that accidentally got put together as a film instead of a tv show. For older people this film is probably a nostalgia trip but for the younger generation I can't really recommend this movie.",American Graffiti
127,knucklebreather,Doesn't Disappoint,9,23 April 2010,"""American Graffiti"" is, in a sense, not a new concept. The fifties and sixties were littered with movies where teenagers cruised around, got into trouble, and it culminated in some kind of an action-packed final confrontation, often enough it was a climactic drag race as in Graffiti. Most of these movies were pretty terrible and remembered only because they were mercilessly mocked in an episode of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"".Graffiti though, despite having a capsule plot that is indistinguishable from those clunkers, is one of the great achievements in film history. What exactly makes this movie so good, then? I have to say it's because we very quickly care about the characters. This is accomplished simply enough - they are archetypes, familiar types of people we can all relate to, sometimes quite personally. There are the two guys heading off to college and a bright future. Steve seems happy with the decision, and is so ready to move on that he tells his hometown girlfriend they should date other people. Curt is ambivalent and leaning towards staying home, despite not seeming to have any particular reason to remain, as Steve does. John is the popular, savvy drag race king who is bitterly aware that he's being left behind as high school is over and he isn't heading to college. Terry is the geeky loser whose friends look out for him, and although the role starts out one-dimensional, depth is happily added as the movie progresses. There's a beautiful simplicity in the way we know these character's life stories and can relate to them within a minute of their appearance on screen. Part of it is the acting, part of it is the naturalistic yet poignant writing. The bottom line is that George Lucas makes us care about these guys, whereas with most movies like this from a decade before, we just felt like laughing at the leads. Once we care about the characters, Lucas is careful to give them a night full of amusing adventures and misadventures. Their experiences are triumphant and awkward at the same time, which is just perfect. The movie takes place over the span of one night at a crossroads in the lives of 4 young men. It's only right that things are exciting yet confusing, because that's just how life is when you're 18.The movie also has a great deal of nostalgic appeal, of course, and although for me, the answer to the movie's tag-line ""Where were you in '62?"" is ""not even born yet"", I still love the ambiance, the time capsule quality of the movie. Of course, the music is a big part of this, but there's also the cars, the goofy slang words (this is boss!) and just that general nostalgia for the time period that pervades the whole movie.For me, ""American Graffiti"" compares well to its contemporary ""Mean Streets"" which is similar in feel in many ways but lacks Graffiti's intentional nostalgia and tidy package of an ending. Graffiti also stacks up well against its 70s nostalgia counterpart, ""Dazed and Confused"". It's not that one is any better than the other, they're just both great nostalgia pieces on the time period they fixate on. If you've liked one you should like the other, I think.Graffiti is at its best when you feel like (or wish you were) in the car with the kids. It's all stuff you more or less went through if you had a typical suburban upbringing in America at some point in the last 50 years, and the movie does an exceptional job of capturing that. Although it all takes place on one night in 1962, it's surprisingly relevant today, and more modern viewers should track this one down. It's a lot more than just ""some movie George Lucas made before Star Wars"".",American Graffiti
128,brent_or,A Wonderful Portrait of American Nostalgia,9,5 December 2012,"I probably agree with those who feel this to be George Lucas' greatest achievement. It very evocatively captures a moment in time, both culturally and in the characters' lives, and even though I was decades from being born yet in American Graffiti's 1962 setting, I can't help but be drawn into the yearning sense of uncertainty, melancholy and hope.All of the elements work together beautifully. The look of the film and cinematography, the soundtrack of early rock and roll songs, the terrific ensemble cast, the classic cars. By focusing on a single night in a single town, the film is able to get inside the minds of the characters, who are all at points in their respective lives where they wonder who they will be, or should be, when the dawn breaks the next day. There is not really any one ""main"" character; rather, there are four separate stories going on at the same time, involving a group of friends, and all tying together at the end.The only thing that I would change is the profanity, which realistic though it may be, is a bit more persistent than I would like. But as an artistic statement, it is hard to imagine how American Graffiti could be any better than it is.",American Graffiti
129,SmileyMcGrouchpants,Where it all came from!,10,29 January 2020,"The constant music only helps capture that moment in adolescence -- that desire to stay up all night, to experience the interstitial changes between day and the nighttime mood, to linger beyond the closing of the door. Like John Waters's ""Hairspray"" and countless others, you feel a pre-Beatles/pre-John F. Kennedy assassination amount of hopefulness abounding. The good mood and the wit don't let up. You'll like this movie, even if you weren't there. Even if your own parents made you feel like a parasite just for being born. That ""country of rock 'n' roll,"" as Thomas Pynchon says, and suddenly, it makes a lot more sense. A *lot* more sense! Let's stay up all night! Let's stay up all night. And play are Tuscadero records. So there. It comes full circle. Peace!",American Graffiti
130,Primtime,Made me want to see the sequel,8,26 October 1998,"American Graffiti is a classic example of American filmmaking and truly shows the beginning of the genius of George Lucas. I absolutely loved this film and its characters because it is just downright funny and doesn't have to use obsenities every second word to accomplish this. Some of today's directors and writers of the younger generation should take note. I am not from this generation, however, I felt as if I had been taken back to this point in time and it almost seemed familiar to me.The acting in this film is superb, especially Dreyfuss and Le Mar who play their characters to a par. The photography is great especially during the climax of the film (Harrison Ford Losing?). I would even consider going to rent the sequel.A must see! 8/10 stars.",American Graffiti
131,antonjsw1,Thoughtful film with first rate ensemble acting,9,15 August 2010,"George Lucas's second film as a director is much more accessible that his previous effort, THX 1138. It is engrossing and draws you in for the whole story, despite the steady pacing. This is because Lucas focused much more on the story of the characters, rather than the technical aspects which frequently distracted the viewer in THX. Nevertheless there is still aspects of the film making that are experimental choices, notably the choice of film format, shooting in Techniscope. Also, like THX, Lucas also elected to have a group of personnel heading up the photography: Lucas himself, Haskwell Wexler (who helped light some of the outdoor sequences), and lighting cameramen Jan D'Alquen and Ron Eveslage. This unusually large collective, not headed by a typical director of photography, nevertheless worked extremely well. The photography is all the more impressive bearing in mind it was filmed in just 28 days entirely on real locations, without the access to purpose built film studios. The atmosphere set up is entirely appropriate, albeit the cars do seem to be lit more stylishly than the actors! But the cars, are, after all, a key backdrop to the story.Written by Lucas,Gloria Katz & Willard Huyck, the script captures the atmosphere of the time very well. There seemed to be a lot of scenes that were ad-libbed and/or improvised, which together with the way its filmed, give it an immediate and reality based quality that further enhances the film. The character's motivations are interesting at the start of the story, but it's fascinating to see the characters' plans evolve, or even completely change in one night. The humour is subtle and unforced, and kudos has to go for Lucas for an approach to directing that is ideal for this material. He seemed quite content for the actors to hold centre stage, albeit evoking an optimistic atmosphere, which is poignant with this story set immediately prior to the effect Vietnam would have on the nation's psyche. In fact, the film's ending is powerful and entirely appropriate, even if it took just a little too much time to get there. Its a shame that the this ending wasn't properly acknowledged or appreciated with the decision to make another film. Art direction and editing are solid. Lucas trail blazed the role of the music supervisor by foregoing a traditional soundtrack and writing the a draft of the script with specific songs in mind. Apart from the notable absence of Elvis Presley (budget limitations?) the musical sources work brilliantly and further enhance the atmosphere.Acting performances are very naturalistic and improvisational, with strong performances all round, so I won't single any one out, as the whole cast were very good, though the stories ultimate focus seems to be on the Curt character, with Richard Dreyfuss being first rate with an interesting and refreshingly realistic take on his character.Overall a very enjoyable, accessible and thoughtful piece.",American Graffiti
132,Laitue_Gonflable,Corny but classic,6,18 September 2003,"American Graffiti is really the sort of film that can be regarded as a classic, without its actually being particularly great. It's entertaining, and it makes you laugh, but it's very corny at times, none of the elements are particularly well done, in fact the only reason it's so famous is that it's a clear sign of the times both in which it was made and in which it is set.The various stories it tells about four friends at life's crossroads in the sixties, and the events that befall them on one particular night, are all really quite good. They're amusing and well-paced (for the stories they're trying to tell). The characters are developed in a fairly shallow way, but developed nonetheless. One gets the impression that they're just fairly shallow characters. I think the definite positive of this film is it doesn't actually have a low point, but at the same time, it doesn't reach any blistering highs either, it's really just a simple, fairly comic narrative. Entertaining, but not brilliant.So overall, despite occasional hammy acting or corny line, American Graffiti is definitely worth a look. A sign of the times though it is, it still gives you a good time and a good feeling all these years later. ***1/2 / *****",American Graffiti
133,mrspasm,George 'Apology Accepted' Lucas Strikes Back!,8,16 September 2009,"American Graffiti is aBurroughsesque cut up segment movie about what George 'Me's a so sorry' Lucas got up to when he was a teen in the 1920s. It seems that George 'Warwick ""Willow"" 'Wicket' Davis' Lucas liked to drive cars, avoid school, listen to rock in roll Muzak and get into various scrapes with girlies. Of course George 'Never see me and Spielberg in the same place' Lucas's favourite past time was defacing local establishments with graffiti. George 'Short Round' Lucas and his gang would scrawl such witticisms as 'Nerds suck!', 'Berry Rulez OK!', and 'I have visited Lola's pants' all over buildings and walls. Theu would ruthlessly organise 'hits' on certain places: homes of teachers and enemies, toilet walls (sometimes not with paint), and alleyways. 'The Fonze Is My Daddy', 'School is 4 fools', 'LOLZ!

It's all very funny and perplexing.George 'Strike Me Down' Lucas directs his first feature feelim here and gathers together a cast of unknowns who would go on to remain unknowns, with the possible exception of Harry 'Son' Ford. It was quite a success for George 'Akbar' Lucas, earning him a lovely first pile of money and an Academy Award nomination. The film has an authentic 50s feels as all the characters have funny names like Curt, Chad, 'Steve' and Flapiddy Sshlap. The cars and clothes and musics and hair cuts are all fairly accurate proving that Gunga Lucas was about in those days and observed everything from his mother's basement. We watch the lives of these characters over a few years, some race cars, some race tractors, some die, some go on to have successful careers. Of course the most successful career prize would go to George 'I killed them all, even the children!' Lucas. With the money he made from this he made, after a brief 3 year holiday to Jamaica, the greatest film trilogy of all time- Star Warp! Best Scene: When two main characters are having a game of Turkey in their cars, and the bad guy spins out and crashes. The hero, based on George 'ooh my, R2!' Lucas, leaps over the front of his car and punches out the bad guy. A blue flash takes over the screen and he is suddenly transported to another place, in the arms of a naked lady who kisses him. Just as he wonders what is going on a burly man bursts into the room with a shotgun- 'Daddy!?' she cries. 'Oh boy!' replies our hero. George 'no to Jabba Wanka' Lucas.",American Graffiti
134,trescia-1,You Kinda Had To Be There,10,7 February 2019,"George Lucas made two (count 'em) TWO films that changed the world. Most people couldn't make ONE movie that would change their bank balance. It seems silly now that a ""nostalgia"" piece about 1962 made just ten years later would have that kind of impact, but it did. For example, ""American Graffiti"" spawned a ""cruising craze."" In the eighties, cities had to pass ""anti-cruising"" laws to combat the mobs of young people trying to re-create the movie in real life. It got pretty nutty.But teen-age fads weren't the only things generated by this wonder of low-budget film-making. ""American Graffiti"" changed the way movies are made. It changed the way stories are told. It had a deep and abiding impact on American culture and on the world. It introduced the ""Wolfman Jack"" meme--the unthinkable (today) phenomenon of ""faceless"" celebrity. American culture was weirdly insulated and controlled in the fifties and sixties. People today have no idea. For example, I never saw an image of Jimi Hendrix while he was alive, and I didn't live in a cave. Things were just different. ""American Graffiti"" was one of things that changed that.The movie served as both a catalyst for change and the source of a lot of obnoxious attempts to ""cash in"" (and cash in they did!). The ""Happy Days"" wave of dumb ""nostalgia"" was generated by this. In the seventies and eighties, a whole world of silly industries pandering the fuzzy memories of baby-boomers grew up around concepts that were first explored in ""American Graffiti."" It's the Rosetta Stone of American culture (pre-hip hop). I watch this and am amazed. I see my country here....but if you didn't live through it, it won't make any sense. Just some dumb white kids driving cars and listening to old music.",American Graffiti

Most of them will still be together, bu they have to say goodbye to a good friend who is going off to a distant college. This friend also has only one more night together with his beloved girlfriend. During their drive they run into several antagonists. They challenge some of these antagonist to race them. These scenes are pretty unrealistic but only make the movie more appealing and fun. This movie has great characters, and a great soundtrack. I loved all of the songs they played in the movie. Those old doo wop songs created the perfect score for the film.",American Graffiti

The characters feel so real which makes it really easy to get invested in their car riding hijinks. I think everyone in the film hates each other but in a good way. It's like they can't stand each other but something keeps calling them back. While yes the film takes place in the early '60s, a lot of young people are still going through these dilemmas.Because of this, I feel the film will still be relevant in years to come. If I'm being honest, some of the subplots are better than others and because of this, it can drag down the film as a whole. I can forgive that because what the film does right it does super right. Plus how can you hate this film when there is a cowboy Harrison Ford in it. I certainly don't.",American Graffiti
137,BruceCorneil,Thanks George Lucas !,8,24 March 2003,"As the plot and the characters of this movie have already been thoroughly discussed elsewhere , perhaps I can just make one additional observation in regard to the wider influence that it had during its initial release.Specifically, the outstanding success of this landmark film was largely (although not entirely) responsible for starting the ""retro"" craze that quickly grew into a major international subculture and is still going strong today. Although, back in the '70s we used the word ""nostalgia"". The movie's soundtrack album, which was nothing more than a compilation of 1950s and early 60s Top 40 hits, generated massive sales figures across the globe and immediately triggered a flood of similar vinyl offerings from other record companies. Being the ripe old age of 13 in 1973, I totally lost interest in the music of the day and started to collect many of the aforementioned compilation albums.Again, as others have correctly pointed out, the initial retro scene was mainly confined to the musical side of things which included the establishment of ""Oldies"" radio stations. It wasn't long, however, before the general mood of nostalgia became more widespread with an increasing number of people becoming interested in other pop culture commodities of the era such as movies,TV shows, cars and clothes.Pretty soon the whole thing exploded and the ""Good Old Days"" suddenly became big business. And why not? There's some fabulous entertainment to be found in the archives for those who care to look.Give me 'dem ole' time movies any day of the week! In fact, when you look back, I think we owe a debt of gratitude to George Lucas and the gang for giving us ""American Graffiti"". It started a positive and enjoyable marketing trend which has brought a great deal of pleasure to millions over the years. And that's a pretty nice legacy for any movie to leave behind.",American Graffiti
138,GLanoue,"Coming of Age, American style",9,12 February 2011,"People will think that this film is nostalgic, which is certainly one dimension fuelled by the soundtrack, but it is more than this. Seemingly a nostalgia flick from the early 70s that celebrated the loss of innocence of the pre-Vietnam-era 1960s, this is a reminder that George Lucas was a great filmmaker before he became a victim to his own Star Wars mythology. It's really a coming of age movie, post-James Dean and Marlon Brando's Method brooding that retains the optimism and energy that was and still is at the heart of the American Dream. It's a delight to see a lot of future heavies get their licks in this movie, and the decision to cast Charles Martin Smith as the Toad was in fact radical for the time, since he was far from leading man handsome or charismatic. I think this marks the beginning of the brief reign of the excellent character actor in A roles, that ended recently with Gene Hackman's more or less forced retirement and the domination of CGI and huge budgets. This film also pioneered, perhaps inadvertently, the blurring of fact and fiction, when we see a pre-druggie and pre-incest Mackenzie Phillips playing a sexually precocious preteen. American Graffiti also shines as having one of the best cost-to-returns ratio of any film ever, showing that at some point it was still possible for Hollywood to make a great little flick without the boredom and brooding darkness of the European art house fillum that played in three venues because it won the Golden Plow award in some Bulgarian film festival. How so? Good scripting, intelligent casting, great editing (no thanks to Lucas, though). It was also pretty daring to set the film in, more or less, real time at night. Lucas knew how to light these night time scenes and give them way more energy than if they had been shot with natural light during the day.",American Graffiti

Teenage friends in Modesta California. American Graffiti is the Godfather of Coming Of Age films, produced by Francis Ford Coppola who ensured the financing, and marks the first feature-length film by director George Lucas (who was also writing the Star Wars screenplay at the time), the beginning of Harrison Ford's major film career (and his long-time collaboration with Lucas), and kicked off a late 50s/early 60s music nostalgia craze in the 1970s.The film stands on its own merit as one of the all-time greatest comedies, even without all the historic film footnotes and trivia, and I highly recommend this film for all ages 10+.The fabulously integrated period soundtrack ate up the majority of this film's budget, as it was filmed almost entirely at night in just four weeks on location in the Valley.A MUST-SEE MOVIE easily making the 100 Greatest Films list, and my ""Top 10 Greatest Comedy Films"" list, and its immense popularity made it the highest grossing film for many years after its release.Influenced the late 50s/early 60s music and dance nostalgia revival of the 1970s, including the 'Happy Days' and spin-off 'Laverne & Shirley' TV shows (starring Ron Howard and Cindy Williams from AG).",American Graffiti

Southern California depicted as a whites only playground.The only exception was the Latino gang member there to be mocked for being short. The other gang member was a white southerner. So rednecks and Mexicans were in the same gangs in the 50s/early 60s? Huh?If you ignore the all white cast, happily sheltered away from other ethnic groups, some other things come across as creepy. The girl talking about lust for her own brother. The 18 year old pretending to be horny towards a 12 year old.And for a comedy it sure isn't funny. As in no jokes. Seems nostalgia explains the fans of this film. 25 year olds watching this film about back when they were 15. People in the early 70s wanting to pretend 1962 was ""innocent."" Guess they don't remember Cold War missile crises and racists attacking civil rights demonstrators. There's more of that White Nostalgia again.Great soundtrack though.

141,bull-frog,Overrated,5,6 August 2008,"I guess I'm also not a real George Lucas fan. Never cared for Star Wars. And I don't care for this movie as well. American Graffiti seems to appeal to nostalgic baby boomers who grew up during the 50s and 60s. Biggest problem is that the movie has no real plot. It just seems to drag to no end. There are several groups of stories, with little relation to each other. Graffiti generally centers around familiar teenage scenes with high school aged buddies cruising around town picking up girls on a Friday or Saturday night.Although Richard Dreyfuss probably gave the most credible job, it still doesn't compare to Jaws, which I think is the best performance given by anyone I've seen. Paul Le Mat did a fine job as well. I liked his interaction with drivers of other cars while cruising around. However the rest of the cast is pretty annoying (particularly Mackenzie Phillips) with rather hammy performances and mediocre dialogs. The cinematography was generally pretty decent, though there were some ""night"" scenes obviously shot with blue filters. If you like early 60s nostalgia, flashy cars, and high school punks, this movie may be for you. Otherwise take a pass. If you like movies with a teenage setting, I suggest you check out The Heathers.",American Graffiti
142,MyDarkStar,Truly a landmark film,9,29 December 2002,"George Lucas made two films that will always be known as breakthrough & defining films. One is obvious : ""Star Wars"".
The other is almost just as important : ""American Graffiti"".
By seamlessly intertwining the soundtrack into the movie, Lucas made this simple film into a breakthrough cinematic experience. It opened the doors for the usage of music in the future of film.But the great thing about the way the music is utilized is that it isn't just used for the sake of filling in otherwise dull spots of the film. It is used in a way that fully capture the whole 50's experience. Of course there are so many other aspects of the 50's that help Lucas accomplish his snapshot of the 50's experience. There are the cars, the fashion, the trends...and of course there's Wolfman Jack acting as a type of narrator throughout the night.Besides capturing the 50's experience on film, ""American Graffiti"" also acted as a catalyst for the ""50's revival"" in TV shows & music - another reason this is such a landmark film.For me personally, after viewing this film, and listening to the soundtrack as a child, I too felt that I had experienced the 50's in a way.",American Graffiti

The heroes, villains, doers and watchers each had their moment on stage. And it was narrated by the town's favorite radio DJ (in this case Wolfman) that somehow connected every high school in your hometown.This film is a true classic. Along with Animal House, it defined the wry side of American youth academia. Anyone who hasn't seen this flick gets three days' detention.",American Graffiti
144,writtenbymkm-583-902097,Hot rods and cruising???,4,4 June 2016,"I just read the other reviews and one thing jumps right out at me. All the reviewers -- whether they liked the movie or not -- seem to accept without question that in the late 50s and early 60s (the movie is supposedly one night in 1962), teen boys got in their hot rods and big souped-up muscle cars and ""cruised"" around and around and around and around. Now, I never lived in Modesto, or anywhere else in California, so maybe that actually happened there. But everybody in the world didn't grow up in Modesto, California. I myself grew up in twenty-something mostly small towns in seven different states in the American south and Midwest, in the time period represented in this movie. In all those states, in all those towns, I never, repeat, never, ever, saw a ""hot rod."" When I was old enough to drive, I did not get in a car and spend the evening and night ""cruising"" the town's streets, looking for girls to pick up. Most guys had to borrow their parents' cars. I knew one guy with his own car, and it was a really cheap old Ford that had trouble getting up steep hills. We didn't cruise around looking for girls, we called a girl and made a date, picked her up at her parents' house, and took her to a hamburger place or a movie theater or possibly to a school dance. Any girl who allowed herself to be picked up and driven around would've gained a terrible reputation and been avoided by everyone else. So I don't get it, I don't get the time and setting and atmosphere and characters, they are alien to me and not from the 50s and 60s I experienced.

The story isn't the most profound but this doesn't matter because it so funny and delightful to watch. It's wonderful see a movie, having such an 50's/60's atmosphere present in it. You certainly dive into the 60's as a result of the good job in picturing the essence of this particular time, for the way how were their hairstyles, their clothing even how they used to dance. However what really caught my attention were the cars and the soundtrack. The classic cars had charm, which most of the cars nowadays lack, and their design made each model unique and fascinating.

148,silva-w-pius,"George Lucas's neon lit, nostalgic theme park ride into the swinging 60's.",9,16 October 2013,"Just like in human history, film evolution has consisted of lots different defining moments and monumental landmarks that have culminated in helping to scrupled cinema into the divine creature that it is now. Some these include; the very first motion picture by the Lumiere brothers and their motion pictures of workers leaving the factory; Birth of a Nation – which is regarded as the very first epic; to Citizen Kane – seen as the greatest film of all time, then we have American Graffiti which is quite possibly the god farther of all teen or coming of age films ever conceived thereafter. Without American Graffiti you have no; Breakfast club, American Pie and more recently Mean Girls (Back when Lindsey Lohan was still a creditable actress) each of them is a fine fantastic film that we all hold close to our hearts, but would never have existed, if it wasn't for George Lucas's neon lit, nostalgic theme park ride into the swinging 60's. American Graffiti is a George Lucas American film gem that interweaves seamlessly and effortlessly between four simultaneous stories. Although they are all different, each in its own rights becomes eventful, full of outrages twists turns that leave your head spinning, thus for us as well as the of the young men who experience them in sunny Modesto in the outskirts of California on the last day of the 1962 summer holidays - each remains unforgettable for all the right reasons. There is no rest period in this film; it goes from 0 – 100 mph in matter of seconds. When watching American Graffiti for the very first (And I envy anyone who is) you can look forward to; pranks, love lost, love founds stolen cars, drag racing, big explosions and a bare knuckle fight just for good measures. It would be hard to find identify a negative from AG, as it is blessed with so many great qualities, you could easily draw on the cinematography, the sound tracks or the acting and for each one you could write a detailed essay on what makes each so great. Like I mentioned before about the neon lit nostalgic theme park ride, I felt the bright lights of shop neon signs lit up and illuminated the scintillating and beautifully sculpted cars, making them look like little fire flies dancing against the backdrop of the night. If someone would have walked in on me watching this film, they would have thought I was crazy, because each time every song played I had to get up and dance, for each was catchy and summed up the 60's majestically, whilst complementing every scenes mood and theme, adding an extra intoxicating layer in what we are seeing and feeling. With the likes of the ""The Great pretenders"" by the Platters and ""Teen Angel"" by the Big Boppers, you can't go a whole 10 minutes in the film without a hearing a true classic. Lastly a notable another great aspect of the film were the acting performances exhibited by likes Richard Drayfuss, who plays the man obsessed splendidly, similar to his character in Close encounters of a Third Kind, except you swap a dwarfed alien races for a tall beautiful blond (I know which one I would rather obsess over). Then we also have Charles Martin Smith, who played the helpless romantic impossibly well, never failing to put a smile on my face. We also have the appearance of Harrison Ford (Mr Indiana Jones himself), who at the point of casting still had aspirations in the carpentering field , but his part was far too small, and one leveled for him to really stand out. All in all this film was phenomenal, and if like me you enjoy amazing trend setting films, that will live forever in our hearts, I recommend that if you're going to sit down this weekend to watch a film, I urge you that you make it American Graffiti.",American Graffiti

At the risk of offending them, I'm going to have to admit I don't find this movie to be particularly brilliant at all. I respect everyone's right to their opinion, but if you're like me, you'll wonder why there's so much buzz about this movie at all.First of all, I'm not sure what is so brilliant about this movie when all it amounts to is watching several characters wander around doing whatever enters into their heads. Nothing really happens, and the many different story lines never really interact. There are so many different things going on that it's hard to follow what's happening, and there's no compelling reason for me to want to care what these characters are doing. It's really just an aimless film without any point. What's so brilliant about that? Personally, I thought it was pretty boring. I wouldn't watch this again, and I really wouldn't recommend it to anyone.On the other hand, you may like this movie if you are nostalgic for the early 1960s, or if you want to catch a glimpse of some young actors early in their careers, or if you'd like to see a 1973 version of a teen drama.

If you look carefully, you can see that many of the boys have struggled to turn their 70s hairstyle to match those over a decade earlier. But overall, AG is a dazzling and memorable nostalgic drama superbly written and directed, falling just short of a masterpiece.The editing is particularly good, depicting the experiences of all main characters as they go through the last night of celebration before going off to college. I liked the idea of using the local haunt - Mel's Drive-in - as the focal point for the gang's fun even though they actually spend very little time inside it during that night. Also interesting and nostalgic is the all night 'cruising around' by the kids looking for fun and mostly getting it. One possible complaint that I have is that there should have been an attempt at introduction of the characters at the start. Ideally, it could have been by way of a nostalgic voice-over by Curt Henderson (Dreyfuss) looking back at that night and introducing various characters as they arrived at Mel's.",American Graffiti

When I look back on the era, I shudder to think of the danger that was involved in such commonplace and everyday activity. But at the time, it seemed a mundane and innocuous way of breaking the tedium of the late teen years. Suzanne Somers makes her film debut as the lovely mysterious blonde in the white T-Bird. It seems that at every stage in our lives, there's a beautiful and mysterious blonde in a T-Bird who inhabits our dreams.A great movie for anyone who wants to remember the way it really was when you were a teenager of the 1960s.",American Graffiti

He subtly paints over the meaninglessness with another layer of less meaning creating a hodge-podge of pointed affectation only topped by the four printed lines of denouement; all of which could have been written more succinctly in an aphorism and not gone several million over budget. Lucas would have done better had he clipped the first five minutes and looped it, or maybe the first fifteen depending on the average attention span of whoever thinks this movie is anywhere to the right of the movie greats bell curve.I went into this film not knowing what to expect and left it pretty sure I was disappointed.",American Graffiti
163,kennarb-23010,American Graffiti,5,6 March 2019,My favorite scene from this movie was when they pulled up next to the really pretty girl in the car. One thing I have in common with this movie is Vegas. I used to have cheer competitions in Vegas and my family and friends would all go walk the strip.This movie shows how people would hangout in the 1900's. It teaches you not to be shy. I knew that people weren't really shy. Yes this part of history is cool to me. I love they way they dressed. There was nothing in this movie that made me question historical accuracy. I have not seen any other moves by this director or these actors. I did like the actors and I really liked they camera angels. I love when he pulls up next to the girl at the light and she says something to him and she ends up turning and he try to get his friends to chase her down. I like how confident they were. I didn't like how they were all over a bunch of different girls though it was almost like they were really cocky. This is a movie I would have watched outside of school on my own time.,American Graffiti
164,brtndr,"A Nostalgic Review of a Nostalgic Movie, that began a new form of Nostalgic Entertainment",10,17 August 2012,"Remember back in the 90's when 70's nostalgic entertainment became a popular genre in movies and TV shows? A pop-cultural shift in entertainment that came to a crescendo by the end of the decade with the release of Boogie Nights, The Ice Storm, Slums of Beverly Hills, and Jackie Brown in 97', and the premier of 'That 70's Show' in 98'. All of which, was due in large part to the surprising success of a small semi-autobiographical independent film called 'Dazed and Confused' in 1993 about one night in the lives of high school students after the end of the 76' school year.The sudden popularity in retro 70's Nostalgia entertainment during the 90's wasn't a new pop-culture phenomenon however. But merely a nostalgic repeat of a cultural phenomenon that happened in the 70's when an even bigger 50's nostalgic form of retro entertainment was kicked-off after the huge surprising success of the small semi-autobiographical independent film ""American Graffiti"" in 1973, which was written and directed by George Lucas about one night in the lives of high school students after the end of the 62' school year. Sound familiar? Despite its shoe string budget 'American Graffiti' became so popular and beloved by audiences in the 70's that Richard Dreyfuss, who played 'Curt' in the movie, said in an interview that co-star Cindy Williams called him shortly after the wide release of 'American Graffiti' and told him to, ""Go have dinner at a restaurant and see what happens."". When Richard Dreyfuss took Cindy's advice out of curiosity, to his surprise, he was greeted with a room full of patrons and restaurant employees standing and applauding his arrival. This could be considered the official moment when a whole new form of modern nostalgic entertainment began.Sure, there were nostalgic Westerns before that, but no one watching them was actually alive during the events depicted in the multitude of Western movies and TV Shows of the 50's and early 60's. And a lot of the War movies were made while the actual war in Europe and the Pacific was still being fought, and shortly after the war that eventually extended into South Korea during the early 50's. So the War movies were more of an attempt to romanticize current events, and not so much a nostalgic retrospective of the past.All that kind of changed after 'American Graffiti' was released, and the 50's nostalgic era of pop-culture entertainment was officially on. Happy Days, Laverne and Shirley, Grease were all huge hits during the 70's, while lesser known but equally beloved low budget cult classics like American Hot Wax, The Lords of Flatbush and The Wanderers contributed to the saturation of 50's pop-culture nostalgia as well.Also, Sha Na Na was a very well known 50's retro musical group that must have been popular with someone (don't ask me why?) because they were everywhere in movies, radio and TV.But, of course like every temporary pop-culture sensation from Jazz music of the 20's to Adam Sandler movies at the turn of the century. The 50's nostalgic period of the 70's was coming to a slow but definite end with the declining popularity of TV shows like Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley, and the release of only a hand full of movies like Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Outsiders' and 'Peggy Sue Got Married' in the 80's. And, the super retro group Sha Na Na had already broken up as well, although nobody noticed or cared at the time. Whatever your opinion is about the actual cultural landscape of the mid 50's-early 60's is? The 70's era of 50's nostalgia would have probably never been bank rolled to the extent that it was, if it wasn't for that small semi-autobiographical independent film ""American Graffiti"" in 1973, written and directed by little known George Lucas back in the early 70's. Whatever happened to that guy anyway?",American Graffiti
165,polos_are_minty,American Graffiti,7,21 October 2011,"American Graffiti at first glance appears to be a typical American High School film, with all the stereotypes that go with it. On watching I'm afraid it does very little to alleviate that sense, yet it is an important film for it's genre and probably created many of the stereotypes which are common place today.I think a lot of the films value probably comes from nostalgia and having grown up in similar times, with events like this going on around you. I can't really relate to any of the characters, that doesn't in any way mean I don't find some of them interesting, I just think that most of the time they are too obvious.The film is well made, and certainly proves that Lucas can direct without entering too deeply into the realms of fantasy. The music of the film certainly fits it perfectly, and adds to the flavour and feel of the piece.It is definitely a believable film as well, whilst watching you certainly get the idea that this actually happened and the characters, even if horribly 2-D, are reflections of real people.It was also a novel experience to see actors like Harrison Ford and Ron Howard so young on screen. Apart from the novelty factor though that really doesn't add anything to the film.I would say that American Graffiti is a good solid film, but it is no way one I can profess to love.",American Graffiti

I've no idea if young people still cruise anymore, but knowing the GPS coordinates of that honey or hunk you have your eye on must surely detract from the thrill of a chance meeting.In any case, Mr Lucas takes a talented group of unknowns and wrangles them into an ensemble of great quality. His creation of some truly engaging over-the-top vignettes backed by music familiar even to the younger generations makes this a worthwhile 90 minutes for anyone.",American Graffiti
167,alexmatte,A symphony in neon,10,25 September 2019,"American Graffiti takes us along a seemingly endless night, evening to daybreak, in early 1960s small-town California, through the eyes of teenagers about to fly their parochial coop the next day to head interstate for college. This is America's richest state at its peak moment of egalitarian wealth, with 18 year-olds able to afford to own and run cars the size of cruisers. And indeed to cruise around town lazily in them all night, doing or aspiring to do the sorts of things teenagers do. The whole film is a wonderfully sympathetic, nostalgic look at that moment in life, and that brief moment in post-war America - 1962, to be exact - when there still seemed to be hope for that nation. Director George Lucas shot the film in 1972, already acknowledging by his change of location away from the aptly-named Modesto, California - which is the inspiration for the film - that the times had changed beyond recognition.Remarkably, the film introduces to the screen in one swoop the baby-faced Ron Howard, Harrison Ford and Richard Dreyfuss, all perfectly cast and delivering exceptionally mature, memorable performances, with all the other very young actors likewise brilliant. As in all exceptional films the musical score is a standout, even without being original - sensational c.1960 hits selected and edited in brilliantly. Above all, the visual potential for this longest valedictory night in early post-war America is fully and nostalgically exploited. A most beautiful, gentle, loving neon-lit ode to a time that will never return.",American Graffiti

This film is really brilliant at doing that so I can understand how it is so well received.However the storyline is actually quite weak because it just follows individual groups of 2 or 3 people that are all doing random things and these paths never really cross in a meaningful way.I feel like Dazed and Confused does this film so much better if you are talking a coming of age type feel",American Graffiti
169,garynorm-79022,What happened???,5,21 February 2019,I am a teenager and this night is nothing like what I have gone through all in one night. In this movie all these teenagers go and do many things all in one night. It just goes back and forth between all the main characters and what they did. The historical accuracy is very well portrayed. This movie does a very good job in showing what happened in the 60's. This movie was well directed by George Lucas. He did good in making all the scenes good. But the plot of the movie just seemed like it was all over the place. It didn't focus too much on one scene just the entire movie as a whole. There were some good scenes but there wasn't really one that made me remember it. I have seen other movies by this director. And I have seen some of the actors in other movies.,American Graffiti
170,cadenixo,oookkkk,5,21 February 2019,I am currently a teenager and this movie was kind of like a day in the life as a teen in the 60s. In Today world things have changed a lot and its funny to look back and see what it was like. Im not really sure how the movie really had a plot but it just showed what teens did back then. This part of history was interesting because people were not connected as much as we are today if they wanted to meet up they would have to find them in person now we can just face time them and see them on our phones and communicate. Nothing is really the same as it was back then other than we all like our cars and some of us still race but a lot of the things they did would get us in trouble. I have seen all the other George Lucas films and I am a fan of them. I liked the movie because we got to see what it really was like back then. The actors did a great job of portraying that part of history. Overall it is a good movie but could use some work by adding more character detail and let things play out more.,American Graffiti
171,haasxaar,"Nostalgic, beautiful, just sad really",10,5 April 2006,"I watched this the day before going to University. It was one of the most appropriate and moving moments of my film viewing life.First off; this is no complex or intriguing film. Its concept is very simple; various teenagers enjoying their youth with pranks, racing, outrageous flirtatiousness and most beautiful and touching of all the teenage dream of romance. My favourite moment of the film is when Dreyfuss's character sees an attractive, young blond early on - he later tries frantically to contact her - she eventually does, but just says her dues and leaves him - the boy, instead of being heartbroken or dissatisfied is happy and upbeat - at least he gave it a chance, at least he lived, as my father put it 'the teenage dream'. It touched me like few films can.That is what makes his film so good, so classy. It shows youth in all its beauty, without cynicism - the simple joys of life are shown in all vibrance. It also does not contain those elements that are omnipresent in modern versions; unnatural lighting, a unrealistic script, profanity. Lucas and Wexler were the perfect combination, Lucas could hide his shortcomings in dialogue behind Wexler's excellent photography and the great performances of all the cast.The ending moved me greatly, being at the stage of life that I am. Every student must watch this film before going to University because it highlights those qualities of youth so well and so elegantly that one cannot help feel tinges of remorse and sentiment at the sight of the plane soaring into the sky carrying the boy to University and away from his childhood.",American Graffiti

173,ericagui,American Graffiti,6,21 February 2019,"This movie was meh, it had some good parts and some others had me a bit confused. This movie is about how teenagers during the 60's would have acted. They go late night driving, eating at a drive in and even dancing all in one night. This part of history is interesting to me, it seems like everything is more laid back, how the cars look and also the music. People seemed more social able and less awkward during that time period compared to now. The director of this movie is George Lucas. After this film he goes on to make star wars which are great movies. The main actors of this movie I have never seen. My favorite character would have to be John. He just seemed like a genuine and cool person in the film. Some things I liked about this movie were how it showed a good depiction of how the 60's looked. I didn't really like some parts of the story, some of it had me confused and wondering how they could all do that in one night or if they even slept.

And though it was set in 1962, the story was true for any generation. Most of us were small town cruisers, and we all relate. Its like going home again to your teenage years. I first saw it in 1974, when I was 13, and got hooked on the fifties music soundtrack. I had not heard that kind of music before. (Belive it or not, there were no oldies stations in those days) I still listen to that kind of music 30 years later. It was my introduction to Chuck Berry and Buddy Holly. I could go on and on, but the best tribute I ever gave this movie, was a real life one. I moved to Modesto California, where the story was set. The cops tried to ban cruising. Ha! We still do it nightly, and hang out at the drive in. Its my town, and its my movie!",American Graffiti
175,brendanmcc02,A visceral portrait of the teenage-spirit,8,19 August 2020,"I literally just lived the last full day of my life as a child - today, I have become an official adult, eighteen years of age. I've been thinking about it, and honestly it just makes me (for a lack of a better word) sad thinking about the future. I lived such a blissful young childhood, I was so innocent. In recent years, as I grew from a child to teenager, I started to lose that child-like bliss and matured. The unfortunate result of growing up is that you start to lose your innocence - that blissfulness from your childhood. It's a despairing thought to think about something you'll never have again, but you have to move on.I could not have chosen a better film to watch right before my eighteenth birthday than George Lucas' American Graffiti. He captures and portrays that despair and fear so accurately. It's the kind of feeling that manifests in your stomach; it doesn't want to make you cry or be scared - it just sits there. Most characters in the film experience this kind of sadness: Curt and Steve both hold a fear and uncertainty of moving on; both are tempted to stay in their towns instead of moving out to other colleges. In the end, Curt takes the big step forward, whereas Steve decides to stay in town for one more year. When one decides to move on in your life, a part of that childhood innocence is lost with your decision. It's a sad reality, but a necessary step in my opinion.American Graffiti holds such a strong legacy as a teen film because Lucas genuinely understands what it means to be a teenager; first, it is the despair of moving on and maturing, and second it is the indecisiveness of the teenage mind: in the film there are many cases of teenage minds jumping from one decision to the next; for example: Steve and Laurie's relationship leaping from one extreme to another - and back again. As someone who has literally just went through my teenage years, I can tell you that we do indeed have seriously indecisive minds. Lucas' incredibly accurate portrait of teenage-spirit is a result of his understanding of teenagers, and indecisiveness is one signature aspect of them.Children are often a symbol of unlimited potential; teenagers can also be seen in the same way. We are often told: ""You have your whole life ahead of you"". For that reason, we tend to have a great sense or pursuit of desire. This is perfectly captured in the film, with Curt chasing down ""The Blonde""; a beautiful, almost angelic woman that he caught a glimpse of on the street. Curt spends the whole night searching for her, desperate for a second glance - a chance to re-affirm if she actually mouthed ""I love you"". Curt then comes upon the realisation, at the end of the film, that he will never see ""The Blonde"" again. The whole idea of pursuing this unachievable desire is so indescribably visceral as a teenager; I genuinely cannot put into words how relatable this is, and it is a wonder to see Lucas have such an unparalleled understanding of the teenage-spirit. Through my years, there have been situations where I desperately want something, and for a split second you actually believe it can come true - it sounds too good to be true, too idyllic, but there is a hint of hope that tells you it can happen: that desire, it can be fulfilled. The worst part is the realisation dawning on you: it was too good to be true for a reason, and that desire will never be fulfilled. It's a terribly sad and despairing feeling, but it's something that all teenagers go through. It's similar to the aforementioned thought of growing up - one fears the idea of growing out of their comfortable childhood, losing their innocence and blissfulness and moving on to a real world: once again, it's a despairing thought, but it's something we must all experience.Other than the visceral portrayal of the teenage-spirit, the film is also incredibly well-edited. On the surface, and in concept, it feels like a student film, but as you immerse yourself in the film, you really start to notice the razor-sharp cutting. It really is no wonder that the same man would go on to direct and edit Star Wars.Moreover, I really enjoyed the structure of the film. On paper, there is a definite possibility for disaster, but it's execution is basically flawless. I thought the structure made perfect sense in a film like this, because most teenagers don't have any clarity or coherence in their lives; there is a sort of order, but also disorder to their lives, and the film's structure reflects this. Was also very interesting to see Lucas experiment with paralleled editing, because that would be a staple and signature of the future Star Wars films.I also found the cinematography to be really... nice. It's quite an underwhelming word, but it quite accurately represents how I feel about the film's look; the cinematography just feels very crisp: not too flashy, subtle in the right ways.Overall, this is an incredible and visceral portrait of the teenage-spirit, delivered from a man who himself was obviously a teenager, but who also truly understood what it meant to be one. Choosing to grow up and to move on can be despairing and disheartening, but it's a decision we all must inevitably take. Unfortunately it's at the cost of your childhood innocence, but we can't be stuck in one place forever. I lived a great, enjoyable and blissful childhood, I have just went through the formative yet unforgettable years of adolescence; now it's time to keep my head held high, and to look onward.Here's to a great adulthood.",American Graffiti

George Lucas made a movie of everything he likes and this is it. One thing I didn't like was that it jumped from character to character and was hard to follow.

I grew up in that time. From the movie, everyone remembers the outrageous cop car axle breaking scene, or the liquor store holdup, or the climactic drag race, but I think of the subtly beautiful and razor sharp authenticity and naturalism of the scene of Curt and his old girl friend talking in the back seat of the car. The easy familiarity of Kurt and the two men in the back room of the arcade. John Milner and Carol strolling through the junk yard. The older girl at Mel's diner who likes the Ron Howard character. The teacher and female student standing so closely together in the darkened school hallway. The pain and anguish of Terry. The conversation between Milner and his buddy and girlfriend at the drive-in. Kurt sitting atop a car watching TV, and the blurred gray shapes which appear around him, which turn out to be the Pharoahs circling him like sharks. The liquor store proprietor.

Two of them (Curt and Steve) are planning to go to college. Unlike my experience, staying in their home town is actually an attractive, or at least viable option, so whether or not they will go is a very serious question that the movie revisits often.On this night, we meet Curt and Steve and their friends, and over the course of the night, various people have different adventures, occasionally crossing paths. I learned from watching an interview with George Lucas that inter-cutting the 4 major character stories was a revolutionary idea when Lucas made this movie. It allegedly made the movie a difficult sell for him, but one has to admire his talent for thinking of the idea, and his creative conviction for sticking with his plan. Compared to telling the stories in the traditional linear fashion, the inter-cutting helps to tie the movie together, emphasizes the relationships between the characters and gives the audience a feeling of *being there* watching the events unfold instead of being told a story.It would be completely unjust to review ""American Graffiti"" without mentioning the music. As a modern film-goer, I took for granted that the movie was filled with songs from the time period in which it was set. Watching the ""making of"" documentary, I learned that this was also a revolutionary idea of George's. Although the film-makers put a lot of effort into integrating the music, so that, for example, it would seem to come from a car stereo where appropriate, I found that the music supported the movie more by the atmosphere it created and the 60's associations that the songs brought to mind.I was born in 1979, so unlike George and the films' other writers, I completely missed the 60s, and even the 70s (when the film was made). It is a great testament to the quality of the acting that I completely believed in the movie's characters and even strongly identify with them. George Lucas wanted to make this movie to document his experiences cruising in California as a high school student.

I won't even go into how so many current day film masters made a career launching-pad out of this one because it is so well known at this point.

Last is Charlie Martin Smith as Terry Fields who gets pushed around a lot as we can see in the film meets the girl of his dreams Debbie(Candy Clark).

182,pauljcurley,A Time of Innocence and Boredom,5,13 November 2008,"As another reviewer put it, American Graffiti is ""a retrospect of the good times that people had when everything was innocent"". And that summarizes my problem with this film - I dispute this commonly accepted vision of that time period.I recognize that American Graffiti was considered ground-breaking, and that it is very clearly captures the view that America in 1962 was, metaphorically, a teenager on the verge of growing up and losing its innocence, just like the kids in the movie (which introduced many talented young actors). In the 11 short years from 1962 to 1973, when the film was made, America had changed in ways that are hard to even comprehend.Lucas utilized dozens of pop songs from the period of 1955-1962 to evoke that by-gone era, vividly capturing how much the culture had changed. The old-time rock 'n roll style had essentially vanished by 1973, after The Beatles, the British invasion in general, psychedelic rock, heavy metal and other diverse musical styles came on the scene. By comparison, if a movie was made now (2008) and tried to evoke a time period 11 years ago, would 1990's music (Nirvana, Green Day, Backstreet Boys) sound so starkly different from today's music that it would sonically conjure up an entirely different Epoch? I don't think so.Thus, the use of 50's pop music aptly serves to illustrate the point. However, Lucas also beats us over the head with this music. Everywhere in this film, a car radio is on in the background, reminding us (over and over and over and over) about the ""good times, great oldies"" of the 50's. Since I don't particularly love this music, the incessant nature of it drove me nuts.But my biggest complaint with this film is the myth that America in 1962 was a time of innocence which was destroyed by the Kennedy assassination, Vietnam, and the emergence of the hippie counterculture. I think this Boomer-generation myth only tells THEIR part of the American story. Sure, the 1950's may have been an idyllic time of innocence for white suburban kids driving around in their big gas-guzzling Chevrolets. But what was it like for Blacks suffering from Jim Crow, gays and lesbians who were forced to hide in the closet, non-conformists of any kind, political victims of McCarthyism, etc. Was it ""Happy Days"" for these people? When I listen to 1950's music, I think about how pop and rock music improved so dramatically in the mid-to-late 1960's (thank you, John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, Mick Jagger, James Brown), and, similarly, I think America itself improved during those tumultuous years.Therefore, while I acknowledge that Lucas captures his PERSONAL vision of this by-gone era very well, I don't accept the Boomer myth that this was an innocent time, or the so-called ""good old days"". Rather, 1962 seems dull, insular, small-minded, stifling in its conformity, and all-around LAME. Likewise, American Graffiti is quite boring.Although if listless boredom is the point of it, then it was extremely well-done.",American Graffiti

It is great, a movie that I can really relate to, it has a group of kids deciding where their lives are really going, and a fantastic cast of characters, Ron Howard, Richard Dreyfuss, Paul Le Mat, Charles Martin Smith, and more.

184,butterflyqueen,where were you in '62?,10,26 June 2002,"This was the tagline for AG. I was not born yet..haha but I have had a love for this movie for a long time. One of the American best, it captures a single space in time that will not come again. The innocence of the early 60's. A fantastic Lucas film, unbelievable that the same man who brought us the star wars series directed this one. EXCELLENT and worth viewing even if you are of the younger generations. This film wants to take you on a cruise, and I really felt like I was along for the ride. That is how closely we can identify w/these ppl. Incidentally, this film was shot in sequence over space of one month, which explains the haggard appearance of the characters at the end. Wonderful and touching.

Each of the main characters is struggling with the idea of their futures and what they ultimately value in life. In this movie you have all the usual suspects, Mr. Prom ,Mr. Gearhead, Ms. Easy. Ms. Perfect, Mr. Troubled, but somehow the fear and uncertainty of the future seems to connect them and they become stronger. There is a wonderful sense of community which is illustrated so well through the music and the almost fatherly figure of Wolfman Jack. My two sons just graduated from High school in '03 and '05. It doesn't seem as though they feel as connected to each other, everyone has their own personal reality. In this movie they all share this bittersweet night for better or worse and struggle with elusive dreams.",American Graffiti
186,catesa,George Lucas's Original Masterpiece,10,20 November 2017,"Like most people who weren't alive at the time this film was first released, I came to ""American Graffiti"" through ""Star Wars."" I first saw it on AMC or TCM or something as a kid, and mostly only remembered the awesome soundtrack until I watched it again recently. It's interesting how much more of an impact this movie made seeing it in my 20's versus my early teens. It's not just that I couldn't appreciate the filmmaking or the writing at the time. I also couldn't appreciate just how perfectly this film captures the spirit of youth, because I hadn't lived it yet. Like ""Star Wars"", there's something strangely stirring about ""American Graffiti"". I've never had a movie blow the dust off of long-buried emotions like this one did. I grew up in an environment totally different from the characters, almost 50 years after this movie takes place. But therein lies Lucas's genius: there's something universal in American culture about the magic of your late teens in the summer; of driving through humid nights looking for trouble, looking for love, looking for anything to do. I felt that again for 2 hours - that same sense of invincibility, of endless possibility, of teenage libido and out-of-control hormones that my friends and I felt at age 17. This film put me right back there.Consequently, there's a real bittersweet-ness to ""American Graffiti."" Because just like Milner, Curt, Steve are destined to discover, that sense of unlimited potential fades quickly. We're all forced to either embrace the future of ""settling down"" (Curt) or try in vain to hold on to the past (Milner). The movie is a lot less light-hearted and lot more sad seeing it as an adult. But even in that sadness there's real beauty, charm, and excitement. I daresay ""American Graffiti"" tops ""Star Wars"" as an observation of the (young American) human condition. I hope history will be kind to this film; it deserves just as much love as the rest of his work.",American Graffiti
187,daryahorenko,"I'm the wrong audience for this movie, but it's still enjoyable",7,24 May 2018,"I probably watched this movie for the same reason everyone else did, because it was Lucasfilm's first movie.It just wasn't for me. I'm the wrong demographic for this movie. The humor in the movie just wasn't for me and the male characters acted so much like machos that I couldn't connect with them at all and they're kinds of douchebags. Except Terry, who I kinda liked and I liked most character developments. I know this movie was released in the 1970s and it takes place in the 1960s, but if a guy was hitting on me in such a rude way as some of the characters did I'd probably feel intimidated and run away. I don't like machos and I don't like them in movies either. It's a movie made for young men. Men might enjoy this movie more than I did, but it's just not for me. The female characters were relatable, especially Carol, even though I don't get why she stuck around with John for so long as he was so rude to her.There's a few really funny scenes in this movie, such as one scene that involves buying some high-percentage alcohol and a scene that involves a police car. They were really good comic relief.This is by no means a terrible movie like you think I make it sound. The cinematography is good for its time, the acting is great, especially Harrison Ford's, and the Beatles-like score was great. I noticed a flaw in the cinematography though. I don't know if this was intentional, but near the end we see a lot of cars driving on a road and the lights of the car Terry is driving are reflecting in the camera lens. And while I found the first act kind of unlikable the second act surprised me, I liked how the characters got themselves into trouble, it was entertaining. The third act was really good, the movie went in a direction I did not expect and I really liked the ending.",American Graffiti

It was hard to follow, boring, the events didn't connect at all whatsoever, the ending was anti-climactic, who cares about cars, etc etc.If I could rate this a 0.5/10 I would, and the 0.5 would be only because young Harrison Ford was pretty cute (except for the dumb cowboy hat).The couples in this movie are so irritating. Lori or whatever her name is gets upset because her boyfriend wants to (bleep) other women while he's away, she's upset, she tries to get with the dude Ford plays, he crashes, then she starts crying ""pLeaSe dOnT lEavE mE"" into the boyfriend's arms. This insane lady gets the nerd drunk and does the whole ""I accept you as you are!"" trope when she finds out he doesn't have a car.The events seemed very disjointed from the overall movie, there was no consistency or theme, just a bunch of dudes in cars.The only way I would watch this again is with approximately 2,000 calories worth of snacks mixed with hardcore procrastination from something equally as bad (doubtful) as this movie.

I liked this movie but I didn't really see the a main history event, but I really enjoyed this movie, this movie did a really good job in showing how it really to to be,like the cars, music, relationships, it really showed what was a typical night for an American teen during the 1960s -1970s. it shows how different things are now which is really sad, I wish to be born during those times, this is definitely a movie I would watch again and outside of school, overall this movie was a good one and I would also recommend for anyone to watch it",American Graffiti
190,fanny92,Interesting,3,14 March 2019,"This movie was very interesting. I was mostly confused and weirded out the whole time. It was interesting to see how teenagers acted back then, especially since they're around my age.
This movie follows a few high school seniors in the 60's the night of their graduation. The movie is basically about their crazy antics as teenagers during that time era.
It was interesting to see how teenagers did for fun then and how they acted. I'm not very educated on the antics of teenagers throughout different eras, and so it was interesting to see what they did, or what some of them did in the 60's. It was also interesting to see how it contrasted with teenagers today. They did different things and different things were still popular, but there were some things that were very similar, such as dating, eating out, and mostly doing stupid things.
The director of this movie is George Lucas. The only other movies he has directed that I have seen are Star Wars, and I love them (only the originals though, not the prequels). The main actors in this movie are Ron Howard, Paul Le Mat, Cindy Williams, Richard Dreyfuss, and Charles Martin Smith. I have not seen any of these actors in other movies, but they all did good in this movie, even though it was really weird. It's hard to pick a favorite scene because this movie wasn't my favorite, but I liked the scene at the dance; it kind of set the high school mood.
Overall, it was an entertaining movie, but I didn't really like it. It didn't really have a point to it; it was just really random. It was really confusing too, and there wasn't very much character development. It was interesting to see how the teenagers acted though, and to see things what teenagers enjoyed doing in that era.",American Graffiti

It doesn't go for cheap laughs.  Instead, it is very well-written.  In fact, ""American Graffiti"" isn't exactly a comedy.  It's actually a human drama.  The plot is spare and simple: a bunch of teenagers doin' nothin' on a Saturday night.  Yet out of the simple surrounding the screenwriters were able to do magic.  George Lucas does very good directing.  Not one moment does the movie slow down or let up.  It's fresh and alive.  The acting is realistic and witty.  Not surprisingly, nearly all the actors in this movie became stars.  The characters interact and criss-cross.  And the ending is stupendous.  I highly recommend it.",American Graffiti
192,karlgarc,This movie ain't it chief,5,8 March 2019,"American graffiti was a decent movie. It wasn't the best, but definitely not the worst i've ever watched. One great scene was when the nerdy kid had ordered food from the drive in and then like as soon as the food came out to him his car was gone. It was hard to tell what the plot of the movie was. But i'm gonna guess that it's about teenagers back then and how they'd spend their days. Their clothing was so different back them. 99.9% of the girls in the movie wore dresses and skirts. The other 1% wore jeans. Mini skirts are very popular right now and it's crazy to watch how girls use to be more into maxi skirts years ago. Times change. All the cars in the movie looked like bumper cars to me. The director of this movie is George Lucas. He's made so many other movies. Star Wars being one of them. I've watched only one of the star wars movies and it was really good if i'm being honest, just never got to the rest of them. His movie making skills really improved, from what american graffiti was, to star wars. I liked the cars, the clothes. Loved how everything that happened in the movie all happened in one single night. They never went home, my mom would freak out if i didn't come home all night. So their lucky teens. I didn't like that all they cared about was girls, alcohol and cigarettes, it got annoying to watch. I would not recommend this movie to my friends.

I could not tell if it did a good job of representing teenagers in the 60's because i was not alive at the time. What i did like was the wardrobe. All the clouting looked nice and some of the pieces I would wear today. I did not understand why they never went home. They where outside all night. It would have been interesting to see what homes and what they did inside during those times. Women in this movie are treated poorly they are seen as property still.

195,my_wife_smells,shot in 28 days and it shows,6,9 November 2007,"The soundtrack is the best thing about this movie. Oh yeah, and the bitchin' cars don't hurt.Otherwise, the plot is sssllllooowww. This movie drags along. Don't get me wrong, the nostalgia associated with it (even at the time it was made) is great, but the action (if I can even use that word here) is definitely lacking.This is one of those films that launched a career for virtually everyone involved. Even proved TV actors (Dreyfus, Howard, Ford) first found real success in the movie industry with American Graffitti.Maybe I am so used to seeing movies with so many hot rods in it have more racing or chase scenes, but the one small 30sec. one we are treated to at the very end is just not satisfactory enough for the oil in my veins.I am not an expert on this period, but the look of the characters (greasers, preps, girls on rollerskates) seems to remind me more of a mid - late 1950's scene, not an early '60s. Even the soundtrack would seem to suggest that. Of the 41 tracks, only 11 of them were written or released after 1960, and one of them ""All Summer Long"" by the Beach Boys was released in 1964, two years after the movie was supposed to have taken place. The remaining 30 tracks all came from the '50s.Good to watch on a lazy afternoon one day when you don't have much else to do.",American Graffiti
196,ttommy-1,How did we get from there to here?,6,3 January 2008,"I guess I enjoyed the soundtrack more than the story lines. It was a time before 1963 and the Kennedy assassination, when America was still relatively innocent culturally. The songs were about true love, rather than just random fornication. Everything evolved around music, cars, hamburger joints and finding love. But I failed to see great film-making here, as others have. It is a nice subject matter, moving on from high school friends, an ending of an important stage of life. I am 51 years old now, and I still never have found the same depth of bonding with others that I once had with my high school friends. I was also sad to think, that many in this same generation depicted in the movie American Graffiti are now conservative Republicans, pro war/pro torture religious hypocrites.

Its hard to view this movie 20-20 given the widely viewed subsequent series Happy Days which, while excellent, lacked the excitement and charm offered in the film. The soundtrack is wonderful and the Wolfman clearly demonstrates that a good voice can be hit you more directly than visuals given that you don't see it coming. I would have preferred it if Lucas has continued in this direction rather than become overly enamored with special effects in his subsequent films.

199,Hamza21,Looking Backwards 1973-1962,8,10 September 2009,"This film was a deserved success and a revolutionary approach in film making. It integrated songs into the story and created a product that was greater than the sum of its parts. It observed the classical unity of time, place, and action. The small town where it is set may now be as obsolete as 25 cent gasoline. Downtown small businesses are mostly gone. Its simple story is really a glorified version of 1962 memories, which were not likely the ""happy days"" shown, except in retrospect. There were a lot of changes since 1962. The story is about some high school students who are graduating. Some will go on to college and have a bright future possible in those times. Others will remain and work in middle-class jobs like small businesses. No mention of the agriculture in that area. There are a few hard cases who will meet the police in their professional duties. The 1960s represented the best years of their lives for most people, as measured by the wealth of ordinary people. The story plays upon the ignorance and lack of experience of teenagers, compared to what they will know in a few years. Education isn't always taught, it often must be learned. The entertainment comes from the seeming naive comments from teenagers who find themselves in tight spots. Its filmed from a teenager's viewpoint, adults appear as obstacles or in the background. Its locale appears before the Federal and state highway systems eliminated isolated rural areas with two-lane blacktops. A follow-up film was made showing many of the characters years later. Some are married with children. ""Its a Wonderful Life"" compressed people's lives into one film. Could a third sequel be made? Yes, but it would not be a success because it would remind people of realities best left unmentioned. The early 1970s were not ""happy days"" after the devaluation of the dollar.",American Graffiti

The movie has good ratings but personally I couldn't find myself continuing to finish the film. It got really boring. I have seen some films with Harrison Ford like Indiana Jones and Star Wars, I would have to say this wasn't the best movie that i've seen him in. The characters in the movie seemed weird and not well put together, as if they were just making it up as they go. The film showed some aspects of history through out it considering it was filmed in the 70s. I wouldn't really recommend this and maybe it's because the generation difference between then and now makes this movie seem weird to me. I have seen older movies but this one hit the bottom of the list real quick.

To those of us who grew up as teenagers during the late 50's and early 60's, are able to relive our youth again while watching the many antics surrounding the different characters in the film. Everyone of us knew a ""Toad"" in High School. That, along with a soundtrack containing all the music that so dominated the airwaves at that time, all contribute to making this movie a truly warm and nostalgic trip down memory-lane.

Filled with great music, beautiful cars, believable characters, an excellent cast, strong script and directing (perhaps the first movie made to feature multiple story-lines) American Graffiti is truly one of the best movies ever made. This movie opened up the careers for many young talented actors: Ron Howard (who plays Steve Bolander, the Class President, an all-American kid) later went on to play Richie Cunningham in the television sit-com Happy Days set in the '50s, a product of the nostalgia that came following the release of this movie, and not to forget Richard Dreyfuss and Harrison Ford (who it seems more or less had given up the movie business).

College students were dying and being beaten during protest demonstrations. Watergate was happening. Rock stars from the psychedelic era of music were dropping like flies. America had officially completed the decade long process of losing it's innocence. It was gone. Then something funny happened. A young film maker who was trying to make a name for himself in Hollywood made a movie that was supposed to be simple. It wasn't supposed to be important. But it was. That movie was ""American Graffiti"".""American Graffiti"" is a story about one night in the lives of a group of small town teens. They are all on the verge of something great, but none of them know it yet. That something is called growing up. This night is their farewell to innocent youth. It is an obvious parallel to what America was about to go through. Within a couple of years, most of the people that the film's characters represent would be affected by the chaotic events that occurred in this country. But on this night, none of that existed. These kids were still dealing with the all important activities of cruising, muscle cars, going steady, street racing, the choice between beach music and rock & roll, and whether or not they should wait a year before going off to college. It is the last great American night.Why is this film so important? It was made during a troubled time in America. People seemed to have lost pride in themselves and in their country. We had changed. This simple little movie changed that. It reminded us of what we used to be like. It reminded us of what we could be again. It was about good times. And the country needed a good time. We needed to go cruising for girls (or boys) while listening to Wolfman Jack crank out rock & roll classics. We needed to play pranks on each other without the fear of violent retribution. We needed to be innocent again. The movie did not make us innocent again, but it reminded us that we could be.",American Graffiti

It is perfectly constructed, the four stories intertwining seamlessly, the acting is marvellously natural and the music brilliantly complements the action.It is a very simple film but extremely touching and true to life. It can be wonderfully funny and is also deeply moving. It is a nostalgic look at teenage life in early 60s Califonia but it's more than that. It's a movie about growing up, moving on and making decisions about the life you want.There are moments in all are lives when we realise the time has come to move on, that some period of our life is now over. We leave school and start University, we leave university and get a job, we realise that a casual romantic relationship has grown serious and each of these occasions means an end to an era of our lives and there is nothing we can do to make this not so. We can decide to change direction but we can't decide to go backwards or to stay still.That is one of the things ""American Graffiti"" is about. Two of the boys in the film have reached the end of an era of their lives and they must decide what to do next. It is not just the boys though who are coming to the end of an era, it becomes apparent that at the same time the more universal era of innocent Rock-and-Roll and cruising is coming to an end (the film is set in 62) as well.The plot is minimal, not very much happens, but the film has so much depth and so much scope. It is very precise in setting yet the themes are so universal. I can't imagine it ever seeming dated.So, yes, this film is amazing and if you haven't seen it do. Also if you get it on DVD there is a very good making of documentary that comes with the film - it will shock you how difficult it was to get this film made and released.The sequel film ""More American Graffiti"" is not as good but is fun.",American Graffiti

It's enjoyable to see them in their younger years. For those who enjoy classic cars, this is a must-see. American Graffiti has several story lines running; I've seen it several times since it was released and catch something new every time.  I also enjoy the overall 'look' of the movie. It is an easy movie to relate to, whether or not one has experienced all of the things this movie portrays. I really enjoyed introducing my teenagers to it. American Graffiti is an American Classic.",American Graffiti
215,ligbob,What more can I add?,10,2 September 1999,"When my friends invited me to see this movie during its first release, I had NO ideas what it was about at all. After viewing it I was so impressed that I took a different set of friends to see it. The chords it struck in me were so strong. I was more like the Dreyfuss character but wanted to be like John Milner. I wanted to marry Candy Clark and have Ron Howard for my best friend. My wife is not impressed by this movie and I can't see why! Lucas was able to pull some of absolutely great performances from some very young actors. This movie should be used in high school history classes for its authentic look at a way of life that seems to have vanished from America. Or has it? I think that if you look at some current small towns, American Graffiti still lives on and it's not too much different than the version presented by George Lucas.",American Graffiti

Many people now love movies like Can't Hardly Wait and Dazed and Confused well this movie is what they copy those after.  I thought that the cast was great and it was cool to see many of these people in their younger years.  It is the story of a group of teens over one night.  Nothing really special just enjoyable and you can reminisce about what it was like living then or when you were that age.,American Graffiti
217,Bendrew,The Yardstick for Teen films,9,24 September 2001,"The story of two teenagers on the final night of the security of their hometown, before moving away to college. The first, Curt Henderson played by Richard Dreyfuss, is having second thoughts while the other, Steve Bolander, played by Ron Howard in a pre-cursor to his role as Ritchie Cunningham in Happy Days, feels more comfortable about leaving. As the events of the night unfurl, they explore whether they are making the right decision. If they stay home and don't go away to college they could end up like their friend John, a man several years their senior who has never stopped being a teenager. Curt gets advice from a number of people over the course of the night such as his former teacher, his friend John Milner and DJ Wolfman Jack. All express the opinion that he should go away and experience life a bit. Steve on the other hand, realises that he is not as adventurous and would rather have the security of his hometown and his Girlfriend.The film is a series of amusing vignettes of their last night together as teenagers before they move into Adulthood. It is one of those films where everything falls into place and every line seems totally believable. A film I find it easy to lose myself in, a classic.",American Graffiti

I suppose the closest translation to English would be ""greasers"". This subculture consists of car born rockers in general, and a romantic image of the American fifties in particular. Classic American cars and rockabilly (and in some extent country music) is the center of this culture. There are variations, though not worth mention here.As a part of the common ""raggare"" heritage, there are a few highlights or trademarks. The music of Elvis, the face of Marilyn Monroe and the movies of James Dean, are some of them.When it comes to movies, this is one of the biggest classics. The cars, the soundtrack and the atmosphere. Everything is the way we want things to be. Love it.",American Graffiti

Maybe some actors got sick during the shoot and George Lucas decided to film the scenes with people who looked liked them...when all the lights were out. Sometimes I got the feeling I was 'watching' a radio-show. Not in the last place due to the soundtrack that never stops. I like George Lucas, I love Star Wars, but this movie just didn't do it for me. Dazed and Confused deals much better with the subject. Mind you, I'm not American, so it might be that much of the Americana and nostalgia only appeals to Americans. Maybe not.",American Graffiti

I grew up in the 60's and that was a hard time for kids. So this movie was a release for them to say the least. Great acting as you can tell many of them became so famous.

Candy Clark and Charles Martin Smith are terrific. Paul LeMat and Makenzie Phillips are great too. It's accurate, funny, and smart. I like that it doesn't try to explain anything. The movie just lets you ride along with the characters on a summer night. The Vespa,Toad trying to buy alcohol, the puke scene, the goat murderer, ""My dad says he's a Negro."" All of these are priceless. The ending is bittersweet, maybe a shadow of the war in Vietnam and the unrest ahead. The only negative was pointed out by a friend in college; it's WASPish. Otherwise it's perfect.",American Graffiti

The time period was a hook for baby boomer's who were asked "" where were you in '62?"" The film follows a group of teenagers at the last throes of summer who must make the choices we all must make about the future. Ron Howard leads the cast as a guy who has broken up with his girlfriend and his story intertwines with a hot rod enthusiast, a nerdy type who has a chance meeting with a hot girl, and a young Richard Dreyfus who encounters hoodlums that at first menace him, but eventually respect his cool nerve when challenged. The film is enhanced by some great rock and roll hits of the era. Before Star Wars made George Lucas a household name , this gem is in my mind one of his finest works. Rated PG for mild language. I would recommend this movie for those who enjoy nostalgic themes.",American Graffiti

I knew and memorized every line. I even have an American Graffiti Paperback Script released in 1973 after the flick came out. All this time I never knew where Wolfman Jack gets the line ROCK N ROLL WILL STAND MAN! from until just a couple weeks ago. See I been going through old airchecks, I have some from Wolfman and some from Legendary LA DJ The Real Don Steele. Well the statement Wolfman made came from a song from a Norfolk Virginia based Doo Wop Group called The Showman, they released a song in 1961 called IT WILL STAND and the lyrics said, Rock N Roll Will Stand Man in the song. Here all this time I thought Wolfman made that up, but he pulled it from that song, I never remembered this song till I listened to this old Aircheck from 1968 I might have heard it years ago on Doo Wop night but I forgot. The lead singer of The Showmen was General Norman Johnson who became famous again in 1970 with The Chairmen Of The Board for the song Give Me Just A Little More Time. Wolfman was a genius, so full of references and quips I believe he forgot himself where half of them came from, they just flowed from him like water",American Graffiti

The answer to George Lucas' American Graffiti (1973) is a resounding ""yes."" This film will live forever. Great acting, comedy, action, script, and music. And to have Dreyfus and Ford together as young actors in one of their first films. George Lucas is brilliant in making a film flow smoothly with multiple story lines, and soulful background music with the superb Wolfman Jack keeping us on track. Add top performances by Ron Howard, Cindy Williams, Charles Martin Smith, and Candy Clark (academy award nominee). This film has a personality of its own and is a predecessor of films like Saturday Night Live & Grease.

But one day my mom said it was on and that I would like it. As I am a nerd and a huge fan of ""Happy Days"", I found it to be a great movie. Now, looking back, as a high school graduate myself, I can sympathize with the characters who are unsure about the future.  I felt the same way when I left high school.  Also, It had a great cinematography and I like the fact that a lot of big stars got started here. This was Harrison Ford's first movie, and of course he ended up in a lot of Lucas films like the Star Wars trilogy and the Indiana Jones movies. So I really like this one.

The action, which takes place on one hot summer's night in an unnamed small American town is so atmospheric. It is pacey, funny, sympathetic, and evocative of the era. The acting is exceptional, the photography, mostly at night, is brilliant. The young actors, and George Lucas, the director set a standard that has not been beaten since.  The music of the era, which runs non-stop though the movie by means of the local radio station, is not intrusive and adds to the atmosphere.  I could go on.  There are not enough superlatives to describe American Graffiti. I have the video, the DVD and the CD.",American Graffiti

232,pauleasterday,Bittersweet,10,10 December 2004,"This film perfectly captures high school life and its bittersweet ending. The characters are all so recognizable - the jock, the tough-guy gear head, the frustratingly virtuous girlfriend, the boyfriend who can't wait for the virtuous girlfriend, the insecure guy who doesn't fit in, the easy girl and, of course the confused aimless guy with lots of potential and serious questions about whether that potential will ever be tapped. I could say that Kurt's character was like most of us coming of age in the fifties, sixties and seventies (I don't profess to know what its like to grow up now, and I shudder to think), but I think we can all relate to most of these characters. I've been the popular guy (Steve), the brainy guy (Kurt), the hood (Milner & the Pharaohs) and the dork (Terry). I dated the good girl who wasn't so good but not quite bad enough, the girl who was willing, but who's sexual experience came at a social price that her boyfriends would never pay. This movie shows the point at which all that changes. With few exceptions whoever you were, whatever you did in high school would change dramatically afterward and you could feel it coming. College offered a chance to remake yourself in a positive way, maybe the beginning of a great career or just finding the group of people that you could feel comfortable with, who wouldn't question your actions or ridicule your personality. Likewise, staying home offered other changes such as joining the work force, getting married or just hanging around like you did as a high schooler but without the social acceptance. Whichever choice you made, doubts and fear permeated your feelings toward the future. The ending music to American Graffiti is the Beach Boy's 'All Summer Long', a sweet song with a slight regret about the return to school in the Fall, is made deeper and much sadder in the context of the ending of the freedom and innocence we all have before we have to face the adulthood and the knowledge that there will be no more Summers.",American Graffiti

Going from drive-in to drive-in looking at the cars and the girls. i was a passenger until my older brother went in the army in 1961 end entrusted his 1955 Ford Victoria to me. It looked much better than it ran. Stock engine meant that I never raced. But I was able to peel out with the best of them.

I can only imagine how this man has come to be a movie director by poorly ripping off styles and being so clumsy with the camera. This time he delivers a slow, pretentious movie that goes nowhere. Within an almost two hour-long torture in which the characters are as flat as they could possible be, Lucas show us how mediocre film maker he is by not displaying any knowledge about cinematographic language at all, a still camera, boring shots and a soporific story that should have ended before the first 10 minutes.

243,lath-3,Classically Crappy,1,21 February 2005,"I don't care what anyone else says, nor who says it; this film is total crap. It tracks four separate stories, all of which have nothing to do with one another, all the while a ceaselessly loud soundtrack blares throughout the entire movie. There is no story, no strong message, no significant plot whatsoever. I was thoroughly bored out of my mind. American Graffiti aims at a very narrow audience: Teenagers who love cars, 50's rock music, and girls. For the rest of the world that's NOT like Geroge Lucas, the film holds no particular appeal. I simply don't get why it's being hailed as a classic. Because it was the first film to document completely irrelevant stories and use music from original records? WOW. Big deal. So if I shoot an entire film in a purple tint, will I be hailed a genius too? Just because it's different doesn't mean it's good. Just because you can make a film about four irrelevant stories doesn't mean you should. American Graffiti is the epitome of George's student films made at USC (which I have also seen). Weird, pointless, and ""artsy."" Luckily someone on his Star Wars production team thought of making the Jedi's sword glow and someone else advised him against using the ""Kyber Crystal"" as the central power in the world and said he should use a mysterious ""force"" instead. Otherwise, what would Star Wars have been? Probably what American Graffiti is: crap.",American Graffiti
244,mekad1944,All Time Favorite,10,8 September 2014,"People who view this movie as ""nostalgia"" are kind of missing the point. To my mind it's the equivalent of seeing the Mona Lisa and commenting on how much you like the frame.Also, this film is NOT a comedy though it has plenty of humorous scenes.Now I'm not saying how or why somebody should appreciate a film, I just want to point out why this film hit home so hard for me.This is a coming of age movie. Yes, it came out when I was a Junior in High School so it made me think. About life. About life decisions. About how sometimes the silliest and most insignificant things that affect our life decisions can change the outcome of our lives - forever.Since then I've read so many historical accounts and biographies and I am constantly struck how so many quirky and happenstance occurrences have drastically changed peoples lives and all of human history. This movie is the first time I considered that history is not ""inevitable"". We make our own history by the decisions we make. I'm struck by how many times the best decision is made for the wrong decision. And sometimes the best thought-out and seemingly logical decision can turn out to be just horribly wrong. Like Chuck Berry said, ""It goes to show you never can tell.""We see at the beginning of the film that two main characters have plans to head for college back east the following morning. Curt is hesitant and waffling at the beginning of the picture. Steve is all Gung-ho. The theme is laid out right there in the beginning.""You want to end up like Milner? You just can't stay 17 forever!""""We both know what we want out of life and it's not in this town!""But as the film goes on and events and situations affect them each... at the end the tables are turned and Steve can't/won't leave Lori, his high school sweetheart. While Curt realizes he's not a hood/Pharoah and his elusive quest to find and love the gorgeous blonde in the white T-Bird will not be enough to keep him home.And as he's waiting to board the airplane to go east to college in the morning, there's Milner, who realizes who's got a future ahead (Curt) and who's just killing time driving around the shrinking strip in their little town (him) - Sure, he gives Curt the slap on the face and tells him he's not a big shot, he'll always just be a punk, but he's just hiding the fact that he knows who's making the smarter life choice.Okay, the cinematography, the lighting, the dialog, the soundtrack are all brilliantly executed, but the real point of the movie is, we all need to make a choice to grow up and face our life eventually, even if you don't make it the summer after high school (I didn't).I gave this movie to my nephew to watch before he headed off to college and probably will give it to every graduating high school senior that sends me an announcement.

That drove the great acting and dialogue. The aspect that made this movie unique is the character's relationships undergoing during the whole movie. The underlying message in this movie adds a better outlook on it, the movie is set in 1962 when America was innocent like the teenagers and when JFK died America lost their innocence.

But even today--decades later--the movie has an incredible tone that has universal appeal. On one level, it appeals to Americans (and Canadians) ideal of a simple time: it takes place just shortly before JFK was assassinated and American pop culture went out the window in a mayhem of drugs, acid-rock, and bizarre envelope-ripping behaviours and lifestyles. On another level, if you've been a teenager, you will be able to relate to this movie. The movie was somehow--even to us in Canada hundreds of miles away in a different climate and culture, and a different era--it was somehow OUR last night of summer too. What more can I say? Brilliantly shot with the hand-held camera at times for a suggestion of reality. An incredible film with classic, universal themes and characters. Absolutely love it.",American Graffiti
