0,TheLittleSongbird,"Despite mostly very good production values, this 'Tarzan' lacks swing",4,28 July 2016,"'The Legend of Tarzan' did have a good deal going for it, with talented actors in the cast, entertaining and insightful source material that has been adapted to variable but mostly entertaining effect on film and media and with David Yates as director.Despite not being sure what to make of the trailers/advertising, which indicated a visually beautiful but muddled film, this reviewer saw 'The Legend of Tarzan' anyway because of the above things. Sadly, 'The Legend of Tarzan' is a let down, not an awful film but one where mixed perceptions of the trailers were not improved upon in the film itself. Some very good things here, but a rather bland and dull film without much swing.Luckily, there are some quite big merits here. Mostly, 'The Legend of Tarzan' looks great, with beautiful evocative period detail and even more stunning scenery, while not skimming over the fact that the jungle is also still a place of many dangers, complemented by the wonderful mix of the darkly brooding and sumptuous London and the lusciously colourful and appropriately earthy jungle in the cinematography. A great score was also done with the film's music score by Rupert Gregson Williams, it has energy, whimsy and a cool and again brooding atmosphere.Of the performances, which mostly didn't do very much for me, Christoph Waltz comes off the best. Can't say that I was completely enthused, it is another typecast villain role and character-wise it is one of Waltz's least interesting, however Waltz does inject a good deal of menace and charisma without being too overt or too low-key. Alexander Skarsgaard is at times wooden and a bit too civilised for the title role, but he at least looks the part mostly, does his best with giving energy and feeling and fits within the period.This cannot be said for Margot Robbie, who sleepwalks through her role as Jane and makes her very annoying as well, the snarky attitude really grates too much. Despite looking beautiful and having obvious sex appeal, Robbie has a look far too modern and it sticks out like a sore thumb. Samuel L. Jackson is also out of place and more obnoxious than amusing, with some not particularly funny and often ill-timed comic relief in a role that is like a badly watered-down parody of other much more interesting Jackson performances. Saddled once again with a clichéd and incredibly one-dimensional noble savage character, with a back-story every bit as simplistic and predictable, Djimon Hounsou tries but lacks the dignity and passion needed, it can be one-note at times.Although it has been said that 'The Legend of Tarzan' looks great, not everything in the visual department comes over completely successfully. The editing is too often incredibly choppy and indicated that more was actually filmed but was cut out for time constraints, which accounts for the cheapness of a few scenes and the jumpy incompleteness in some of the more eventful scenes. Particularly bad was the train vine scene, a pretty risible scene in general. The special effects are variable, most are fantastic like the elephants and the gorillas (different to the gorillas one usually is acquainted with but fits the descriptions of the gorilla species from the source material), some like the lions are mostly well-rendered but are hindered by rushed editing and tighter budget constraints seemingly in busier scenes and others like the ostrich, the buffalos and to a lesser extent the crocodiles are so fake-looking and lack the finesse shown elsewhere that it took me out of the film.Scripting was a huge issue here (Jane getting a lot of the worst of it), aside from the story it was the asset that most brought 'The Legend of Tarzan' down. There is a lot of clunky soap opera in the interactions between characters, and it never seems to know which direction to take with distracting shifts in tone, the darker and more tense scenes feel too safe and are too often fatally undermined by comedy that kills the mood, the comedy misfires badly more than it hits and there is a lack of emotional connection. The story gets off to a sluggish start and never recovers, trying too to cram in too many characters and subplots that not only are so simplistic and lacking in dimension but don't make the story as clear as it should be, which does make the film a slog to get through and makes the characters and their relationships not developed enough or as relatable as they should (that's including the one between Tarzan and Jane). Yates shows great technical competence but lacks focus when it comes to the more substance-related elements (story and pacing).Overall, not without its good points but lacking in a lot of areas...including swing. 4/10 Bethany Cox",The Legend of Tarzan
1,Leofwine_draca,A bland CGI adventure,3,19 August 2018,"THE LEGEND OF TARZAN is the latest big-screen outing for Edgar Rice Burroughs's famous ape-man, and thankfully not another lame 'origin' tale but rather a film that feels like one of the many sequels that Burroughs wrote. Sadly, my hopes for this film's success evaporated when I saw that David Yates, the ultra-generic director of the worst HARRY POTTER films, was at the helm. Unsurprsingly this turns out to be yet another bland CGI adventure movie, aimed at kids and without a single bone of wit or originality in its head. Alexander Skarsgard plays the usual strongman, glowering without any charisma, while solid character actors like Samuel L. Jackson and Christoph Waltz are wasted in cliched roles (comedy sidekick and villain, respectively). The less said about Margot Robbie's zero-emotion Jane the better. The film seems to have been written by idiots with no idea of Victorian or Edwardian dialogue (at one point Jane exclaims ""oh my God!"" like a Californian high schooler) but the worst thing by far are the cartoonish CGI animals. The gorillas are a distraction, the ostriches are lamentable, the endless CGI action scenes laughable (even swinging vine Tarzan is CGI). What a pity; give me a good old-fashioned Weissmuller or Scott movie any day over this trash.",The Legend of Tarzan
2,SnoopyStyle,ambitious story,6,27 May 2017,"It's late 19th century. Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgård) had returned to London and reclaimed his title John Clayton III, the fifth Earl of Greystoke. He is married to Jane (Margot Robbie) but they are still recovering from a recent lost. The Congo has been claimed by Belgium King Leopold II but it is driving his country to bankruptcy. His representative Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) agrees to a deal with Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou). In exchange for diamonds, Rom promises to bring him Tarzan for revenge. King Leopold requests Tarzan for promoting the Congo. He is reluctant but American envoy George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) needs him in his investigation of possible enslaving exploitation of the Congolese.It's an ambitious effort to bring a sequel to the Tarzan story. Tarzan may be a well-known story but one would expect it to be redone with the reboot. Instead, we're jumping right into a sequel and it's a little jarring. Tarzan and Jane come off the cover of a romance novel. SLJ is trying to inject limited comedy while the rest has no interest in it. There are some big action scenes but the sad tone and plodding pace saps most of the tension. They are probably better off playing it safe and going back to Tarzan's more well-known source material.",The Legend of Tarzan
3,Horst_In_Translation,"All too generic, too predictable, too uninspired",4,19 February 2017,"""The Legend of Tarzan"" is an American 110-minute movie from 2016. The director is David Yates, who is mostly known for his Harry Potter work and the script is by Brewer and Cozad for whom it is definitely their most known work to-date. The title is of course a giveaway what you can expect here, namely the story of Tarzan. But is it really? Not quite. The film is not about Tarzan leaving the jungle or about him getting together with Jane or anything as, when the film begins, Tarzan already lives as something like an English nobleman together with Jane and they are wearing fancy clothes and living quite the life. The transition from jungle to civilization happened before this film already. It made me think at times that this may be a sequel, but nope it is not. I think the cast is a bit of a problem here. Alexander Skarsgård from ""True Blood"" turns into a Hollywood lead actor and I am not sure if he has the range for this performance. Then again, the writers surely did not give him great material to work with. Same is true about Margot Robbie. Such a generic, uninspired, stereotypical female character really and the worst is she is basically the only female character in this film. The moments when they try to make us believe she is a hotter Dian Fossey really aren't working at all and I am still to see a performance by Robbie with which she convinces me. At least, she is relatively uptight in here for a change compared to her usual performances, even if her clothes get shorter the longer the film goes, just like with the lead actor being basically topless for the entire second half of the film. His female fans will love it. But people looking for a great cinematic experience won't care and they also won't find it.The main antagonist here is played by 2-time Academy Award winner Christoph Waltz. One of his wins came for ""Django Unchained"" and so it is a reunion for him with Samuel L. Jackson, even if they really don't share any scenes at all. It is funny how they basically play exactly the other character here. SLJ is the slavery-opposing sidekick to the protagonist delivering occasionally funny lines. Waltz is the most evil guy in the movie, but still only a henchman to the King of Belgium as SLJ is to Di Caprio's character. Anyway, Waltz and Jackson are also not great here, but at least they manage occasionally to elevate the really mediocre material. This film is everything but bold. The characters don't have any shades. Either they are fully evil of fully good. People may argue that the people and animals Tarzan is forced to fight, offer shades in terms of character, but I would disagree. It was never really a realistic option that these would be true antagonists. And as with the previously mentioned ""Django Unchained"", slavery is also a huge topic in this film we have here, maybe the central issue even. Another core theme would be the relationship between animals and humans. I must say that they sometimes did fine to that regard and parallel, but sometimes it also wasn't working out. A decent example would be the meeting between Tarzan and the gorilla opposed to the meeting between Waltz' character and the gorillas. It's not about defeating nature, it's about surrendering to nature in order to get its respect.A not so great example would be the final fight sequence between animals joining Tarzan in his battle and the bad guys. This one is neither high quality in terms of the story or plot nor breathtaking to watch and far from as memorable as it could have been. This weak ending is also one of the main reasons why I cannot give this film a thumbs-up overall. It is not a failure and it may work as a decent watch for people with very little expectation when it comes to blockbuster films. I am not one of these and that's why I just cannot recommend the watch here. There weren't enough good moments at all for a film with this runtime. It has one here and there, but it is not sufficient in quantity. We will see if this film gets a sequel, but I am not sure it was big enough a financial success to justify the costs. As a whole, my verdict is negative. Watch something else instead. Something that has actually individual creativity.",The Legend of Tarzan
4,Prismark10,The jungle is bare,5,22 April 2017,"If you want to see a film about the Legend of Tarzan, then watch Greystroke (1984).This is a drab, messy retelling with an uncharismatic lead (Alexander Skarsgard) that relies on too much average to poor CGI.Tarzan in this film resides in England, he is married to American lady Jane (Margot Robbie) and he has taken up the family title of Lord Greystroke. He is however a celebrity and King Leopold of Belgium has invited him to the Congo to see how far that part of the world has come under Belgian rule.However this is all a ruse set up by dastardly Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) to lure Tarzan away from England. Lom has done a deal with a tribal leader for access to diamonds he must deliver Tarzan to him so he can avenge his son's death.Tarzan is accompanied by Jane and an American adventurer Washington Williams (Samuel L Jackson) who suspects slavery is widespread in the Congo. What Williams witnesses is Tarzan's affinity with the animals and his jungle power as he strives to rescue Jane from Rom's clutches.The film swings along nicely, we see flashbacks of how the infant Tarzan was raised by apes. Waltz picks up an easy cheque for his vile villainous turn but the script is just too straightforward. The epitome of bland just like the lead actor playing Tarzan.",The Legend of Tarzan
5,claudio_carvalho,Great Adventure,7,16 October 2016,"In the Nineteenth Century, John Clayton (Alexander Skarsgård) is married with Jane Clayton (Margot Robbie) and fully adapted to the life in London. He is invited by King Leopold from Belgian to visit Africa but he refuses. However the American Dr. George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) convinces him to go since he wants to prove that there is slavery in the Belgian lands. Jane also goes with them and out of the blue, the village where they are lodged is attacked by the mercenaries commanded by the evil Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) that works to Leopold. He wants to capture Tarzan to deliver him to Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou), who is seeking revenge since Tarzan has killed his only son. In return, Rom will receive a chest of diamonds that Rom will use to pay mercenaries to invade Congo. However Washington saves Tarzan and Rom kidnaps Jane, expecting to be followed by Tarzan that crosses the jungle with Washington to rescue Jane. Will they succeed in their journey?""The Legend of Tarzan"" is a great adventure of the ape man. Alexander Skarsgård is an excellent Tarzan and the Hollywood's darling Margot Robbie is great in the role of Jane. Christoph Waltz performs an evil villain and the efficient Samuel L. Jackson completes the good cast. The CGI is impressive, with the gorillas and Tarzan climbing the lianas. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Lenda de Tarzan"" (""The Legend of Tarzan"")",The Legend of Tarzan
6,nogodnomasters,All I need is a name,10,25 October 2017,"This film takes place 1889-1890. Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgård) has left the jungle and has assumed being the Lord of Greystoke Manor. Meanwhile the Belgium is in the Congo on a diamond hunt. A chief is willing to assist Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) representing King Leopold if he brings him Tarzan. Tarzan consents due to the arguments of George Washing Williams (Samuel L. Jackson in a rare non-swearing role). Jane (Margot Robbie) insists on coming along.The original jungle story of Tarzan gets told in flashbacks. Initially I thought this was a sequel to ""Greystoke"" but soon realized it wasn't. Tarzan does what he does best, communicate with the animals into an improbable action packed climax which reminded be of the old Johnny Weissmuller movies.Guide: No nudity. Implied sex. No swearing, but Jackson says ""You want me to lick his balls too?",The Legend of Tarzan
7,kosmasp,Legend of the jungle,6,25 February 2017,"While this isn't as good as the Jungle book, it does steer in a similar direction. You have a very well known topic (book/movie) that gets modernized quite a bit. And the action it gets injected with works quite well, not to mention all the great actors in it too (Sam Jackson and especially the always great villain Waltz).But the fantasy and adventure aspect alone may give you reason enough to watch this. The movie does try to give this an extra jolt by messing with the time line and hopping around a bit. This may very well be a stroke of genius or something you don't like at all. The special effects on the other hand should be something to cherish. Nice and good fun with a couple of interesting tweaks and twists. Nothing you won't expect or surprise you too much of course",The Legend of Tarzan
8,classicsoncall,"""Ain't this a hell of a thing?'""",7,7 October 2018,"What I liked about the movie was the way it incorporated flashbacks of Tarzan's origin based on the writings of Edgar Rice Burroughs. I don't know if it was all true to form, but the basics seemed to be there. As a kid, I tried to catch as many of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan flicks I could because I loved wild animals and couldn't get enough of pictures featuring lions, elephants, gorillas and what-not. I can only imagine how thrilled I might have been to have seen this picture back around the late Fifties or so, CGI inspired or not. Back then it was men in gorilla suits, so the criticisms I read about the brutes in this film, though warranted, still doesn't diminish the thrill of watching Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgård) take on his 'brother' Akut, or having all those jungle animals turn out for the final showdown against the bad guys. That's another thing, in a 1930's Tarzan flick, the villains might have been Nazis, while here they were merely interested in that old standby, the profit motive. Notwithstanding the liberal use of CGI and the impossible Spider-Man like ability of Tarzan to wend his way through the African Congo, I did have a good time with this picture, updated as it was for a modern day action crowd. As I often am, I was surprised to see Samuel L. Jackson show up in yet another picture, seems like he's in just about everything these days. I do have to admit that Margot Robbie looked a little bit out of place in this picture, perhaps a mite too elegant and glamorous for the role as Tarzan's Jane, even if right at home in the London scenes. As usual, Christopher Waltz makes for a convincing villain, even if he isn't portraying a Nazi.",The Legend of Tarzan
9,jboothmillard,The Legend of Tarzan,4,22 July 2016,"I know there are twelve classic films with Johnny Weissmuller, and one with Christopher Lambert, but the only version with the famous Edgar Rice Burroughs creation I had seen previously was the average Disney animated film, I was hoping this new live-action film with king of the jungle would be worthwhile, directed by David Yates (four Harry Potter films). Basically John Clayton III, Lord Greystoke (True Blood's Alexander Skarsgård) started life in the jungles of Africa, following the death of his mother from disease and his father killed by Mangani apes, he was found by the apes, given the name ""Tarzan"", and raised as one of their own, developing skills for hunting and swinging on vines. Eight years have passed, John has long since left Africa and settled down with his wife, American aristocrat Jane Clayton (Margot Robbie), and taken his birth name and ancestral family residence, but John's story has become legendary among the Victorian public. Wishing to leave his past behind, John initially declines an invitation to visit Boma and the Congo, George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) convinces him to change his mind, hearing that Belgians are enslaving the Congolese population, Jane is eventually allowed to come as well. John, Jane and Williams reach the Congo and find a tribal village that knew John and Jane during their stay in the jungle, Jane recalls the tribe once considering John, as Tarzan, an evil spirit, and how she met and fell in love with him in the jungle. During the night the village is attacked by mercenaries, led by Léon Rom (Christoph Waltz), who in the past was searching for fabled diamonds of Opar, John and Jane are kidnapped, Jane and several tribe members are taken aboard a steamboat, while Williams is able to rescue John. With the aid of tribe warriors, John and Williams intercept a Belgian military train carrying captured slaves, evidence to expose King Leopold, who Rom is working for, they then move on and discover the family of apes John was raised by, he is considered a deserter and fights with his adult ""brother"" Akut, but he recovers. Jane in an opportune moment is able to make her escape from the steamboat and swim ashore, but she stumbles into an ape nest, Rom rescues her, then his men shoot and kill many of the apes, John later comes to save the remaining apes, before pursuing Rom. John is cornered by Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou), leader of another jungle tribe, John previously killed Mbonga's only son who murdered Kala, after a talk John is spared, just as Akut and the apes arrive to subdue the tribe. Rom plans to take control of the army, taking Jane and the diamonds with him to Boma, a massive stampede of wildebeest is triggered by John, Williams and Akut, the town is destroyed and the soldiers distracted, allowing John to rescue Jane. Rom attempts to escape, but Williams sinks his boat with a machine gun, Rom tries to kill John when he comes swims aboard, but John throws him in the water where he is devoured by crocodiles, in the end Williams returns to Englund to expose slave trading to the Prime Minister (Jim Broadbent), while a year later John and Jane have returned to Africa, to raise their first child in his father's old house, and John returns to be among the apes as Tarzan. Also starring Simon Russell Beale as Mr. Frum, Casper Crump as Major Kerckhover, Hadley Fraser as John Clayton II, Tarzan's father, Genevieve O'Reilly as Alice Clayton, Tarzan's mother, Ben Chaplin as Captain Moulle, Christian Stevens as Young Tarzan (5 Years), Rory J. Saper as Young Tarzan (18 Years) and Miles Jupp as The Valet. Skarsgård is a bit wooden being both posh and with his top off swinging around, Robbie is pretty and fine, Jackson gets good moments as Tarzan's ally, and Waltz does his usual villainous role well enough, the special effects are fantastic, and there are exciting scenes, but the story Tarzan coming out of the jungle and returning to society is a bit wilted, they should have focused on the jungle life of Tarzan, not reducing it to petty flashbacks, overall it is only a mildly entertaining action adventure. Okay!",The Legend of Tarzan

Human. Nature. A new threat awaits.Thrilling and breathtaking Tarzan movie with nail-biting adventures, noisy thrills , violence, cliff-hanging action and special effects galore. There are also some stirring and emotive flashbacks about previous life of our starring, as a kid he becomes orphan and he is raised by Apes, subsequently ruling the Ape clan in the vine-swinging persona of Tarzan, and eventually he returns to Africa where he is immediately recognized by his Ape mates. The contrast between the behavior of Man and Ape is interesting enough. The picture has a historical background about colonization of King Leopold of Belgium on the African Congo and the cruel conditions executed against the unfortunate natives , including hard-working , torture and slavery . As Leopold II of the Belgian rules the Congo Free State in personal union with the kingdom of Belgium. As Leopold borrowed abundant amounts of money to finance the building of railways, diamond mines and other installations , all of them lead to the country is on the verge of bankruptcy. This Legend of Tarzan has nothing to do with others, as those starred by MGM's Johnny Weissmuller, neither the produced by Sol Lesser with Lex Barker or Gordon Scott, nor inferior Tarzan played by Jock Mahoney, Ron Ely , Joe Lara or Miles O'keefe, but it has more relation with Christopher Lambert's Greystoke 1984 directed by Hugh Hudson and resulting in Legend of Tarzan 2016 seems to be a kind of sequel.It displays a moving and rousing musical score by Rupert Gregson-Williams . As well as being colorfully photographed by cameraman Henry Braham. The motion picture was professionally directed by David Yates, but adding excessive digital visuals and large 3D computer effects . This British director is a expert on fantasy/action /adventure movies as proved in Harry Potter saga, as he made various entries : Harry Potter and the order of Phoenix, Harry Potter and the Half-blood Prince, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 and Part 2.

11,paul_haakonsen,This movie didn't really deliver much...,5,4 October 2016,"I can't claim to have had any particular interest in ""The Legend of Tarzan"" and actually only watched it because my wife wanted to. And having seen the old black and white Tarzan movies starring Johnny Weissmuller, then I had essentially seen enough of Tarzan to last me a lifetime.Sure, ""The Legend of Tarzan"" was a beautiful movie visually, but entertainment wise, not so much. This was a very mediocre movie if you look at it for the entertainment value.The story was not a particular thrilling one, nor was it a story that really brought anything overly new to this iconic character.The special effects in the movie were quite good, and the CGI animated animals were quite impressive and very life-like. That was essentially what kept the movie afloat.As for the acting, well I can't really say that Alexander Skarsgård put on a particular memorable performance as Tarzan / John Clayton. He was practically just a walking set of muscles, and I think that they should have cast someone else for this role. Normally I do think that Samuel L. Jackson (playing George Washington Williams) is fairly good, but he didn't really excel in this movie. It was, in fact, Christoph Waltz (playing Leon Rom) who were the driving acting talent in this movie, and he really did so with flying colors.The iconic Tarzan call was there as well, as it should be. But it was a weird mutation on what you are used to, especially if you grew up with the Johnny Weissmuller movies. But for a new audience, I guess this 2016 sound is adequate. But for us older audience, not so much.""The Legend of Tarzan"" was a very mediocre movie experience. And for me, this was a movie that came and went without leaving a lasting impression.

Yes, it gets a bit bogged down with politics at times, and then in the next breath tries to be a big action movie, but it has enough moments to make it worth the admission fee.The standout performance comes from Margot Robbie. What with this and 'Suicide Squad' coming out soon she is going to have a huge 2016. And rightly so because here, as she has done in many films previously, she demonstrates what a good actor she is.

The Filmmakers must have thought that the Tarzan Story is so Familiar that only a Cursory Inclusion is needed.The Movie is so Heavily Bogged Down with its King Leopold Colonial Atrocities constantly reminding the Viewer that such Oppression and Genocide is Evil, that Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgard) and Jane (Margot Robbie) are used as ""Superheroes"" to Save the Day. The Hinted at Backstory is Secondary and the Film is Hell-Bent on a Race to Foil the Interlopers and Their Dastardly Deeds.Along for the Ride is Samuel L. Jackson who seems like a Time Traveler from 2016 and makes No Adjustment to the Period. He's the Comedy Relief because ""Cheetah"" isn't in this one. ""Boy"" does make a very Small Cameo. Also, Chris Waltz as a Rosary Toting ""Snidely Whiplash"" who doesn't Tie Jane to the Railroad Tracks but Shackles Her nonetheless.Overall, if given a Pass as a PC Modernization and Inorganic CGI Popcorn Entertainment, it's Not a Bad Movie, just Heartbreakingly Safe and Shallow.

14,utgard14,A new Tarzan offers nothing to improve on the old,4,6 December 2016,"Another Tarzan movie. This time we're mercifully spared a detailed origin retelling, just a few bits told in flashback. The plot to this one has Tarzan and Jane returning to the jungle after years in living in civilization. Despite being a period movie, it's full of modern characters. This is never more obvious than the film's preference for Jane over Tarzan, doing everything possible to give her character lots of feisty personality and trying hard to make her more than a damsel in distress (even though she spends half the movie as a hostage). Margot Robbie makes the most of it and easily gives the most entertaining performance in the picture. Alexander Skarsgård's Tarzan is a big broody bore who gets his butt kicked repeatedly. The rest of the cast is fine, including Sam Jackson in a typical Sam Jackson type of role (with less profanity). The movie's got a busier plot than you might expect from this sort of thing. It's not terribly intriguing though. Also, the CGI isn't impressive. In fact, in some scenes such as the one where Tarzan and Sam Jackson run around in the treetops, it's downright terrible. The biggest negative is that it's not as exciting as a Tarzan movie should be. Where's the adventure? Where's the heroics? It's too drab and serious. But then this was released by Warner Bros, home of the dark and brooding superhero movie, so I shouldn't be surprised.",The Legend of Tarzan
15,zardoz-13,A Top-Notch Tarzan Tale!!!,10,11 July 2016,"Tarzan movies were once a Hollywood staple between the 1930s and the 1960s. Actually, Hollywood had been producing Tarzan movies during the silent film era as early as 1918. During the sound era, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer inaugurated the first cinematic ""Tarzan"" franchise when the studio cast Olympic Gold Medal swimmer Johnny Weissmuller as the Lord of the Jungle in 1932. Weissmuller toplined twelve Tarzan films for MGM and RKO. Meantime, Tarzan novelist Edgar Rice Burroughs abhorred Hollywood's adaptation of his literary sensation, primarily because Tinseltown portrayed Tarzan as a primitive savage who spoke in broken English. Eventually, Burroughs produced his own Tarzan serial ""The New Adventures of Tarzan"" (1935) with Bruce Bennett. Bennett shared more in common with Burroughs' literary troubleshooter. Not only did he speak in clear, unbroken English, but also he donned a dinner jacket in some scenes! Nevertheless, most moviegoers preferred Weissmuller, and later Tarzans imitated Weissmuller until Las Vegas lifeguard Gordon Scott started uttering complete sentences in ""Tarzan's Greatest Adventure"" (1959) and ""Tarzan the Magnificent"" (1960). Cowboy stunt man Jock Mahoney inherited the role from Scott and spoke in complete sentences, too. When former NFL football player Mike Henry took over the role in ""Tarzan and the Valley of Gold"" (1966), movie audiences saw Henry's Tarzan decked out in a suit and tie as well as toting a briefcase. After the short-lived ""Tarzan"" television show with Ron Ely on NBC-TV, Edgar Rice Burroughs' outdoor adventurer appeared in fewer movies, and those movies were mediocre. French actor Christopher Lambert played Tarzan in the last great Tarzan film ""Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan"" (1984), but the well-made film—that Burroughs would have applauded-- didn't generate enough interest to fuel a franchise. Walt Disney reverted to the MGM Weissmuller template and scored a huge hit with their animated ""Tarzan"" (1999) and a straight-to-video sequel ""Tarzan & Jane"" ensued in 2002. More short-term television series and films followed, but the character lacked tenacity. ""Harry Potter"" director David Yates may succeed where everybody else has failed with ""The Legend of Tarzan,"" starring Alexander Skarsgård, Christoph Waltz, Margot Robbie, and Samuel L. Jackson. Not only would Burroughs approve of Skarsgård's Tarzan, but also ""The Legend of Tarzan"" is a genuinely exciting, often suspenseful, and ultimately satisfying epic adventure that venerates its literary origins.""The Legend of Tarzan"" takes place in 1890, several years after the 1884-1885 Berlin Conference when Great Britain and Belgium split up the Congo between themselves and established European settlement and commerce in Africa. Surprisingly, this is one of the few Tarzan movies that appropriates factual history, and Belgium King Leopold II did indeed dispatch an envoy to the Congo. Léon Rom (Oscar winning actor Christoph Waltz of ""Inglourious Basterds"") is the fictional envoy in Yates' film, and Rom has embarked on an ambitious scheme to obtain the fabulous diamonds of Opar to finance Leopold's dream of equipping an army to enslave the natives of the Congo. Unfortunately, Leopold is teetering on the brink of bankruptcy because he has spent a fortune to build a railroad and forts for an army he cannot afford to pay. Rom plans to acquire the diamonds from native tribal Chief Mbonga (twice-Oscar nominated actor Djimon Hounsou of ""Blood Diamond"") so Leopold doesn't lose his foothold on the Dark Continent. Mbonga is both willing and eager to hand over an untold wealth in gems if Rom can convince Tarzan to come back to the Congo. As it turns out, Tarzan killed Mbonga's son during a hunting trip after Mbonga's son slew Tarzan's ape mother. Since this tragic incident, Tarzan has returned to England and inherited not only his late father's estate as John Clayton, but also his title as the Earl of Greystoke, a member of the House of Lords. The treacherous Rom invites Africa's favorite son back to the Congo for a tour of the new railway and other infrastructure constructed by King Leopold to usher civilization into the depths of the Dark Continent. Moreover, the British Prime Minister (Oscar winner Jim Broadbent of ""Iris"") implores Lord Clayton to go as does an American, George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson of ""Pulp Fiction""), who wants to accompany him on the tour. Initially, Lord Clayton refuses to accommodate the Prime Minister, but Williams convinces him to accept Rom's offer. Williams trusts neither the Belgium monarch nor Rom; he believes that this deceitful, imperialist pair plan to enslave the natives. Naturally, when Lord Clayton's wife Jane (Margot Robbie of ""Focus"") learns about her husband's impending trip to Africa, she decides to join him against his will. No sooner have the couple and Williams arrived than the dastardly Rom and a murderous army of mercenaries attack the village where Tarzan met Jane. They take Tarzan and many natives as hostages. Williams helps Tarzan escape, but Rom abducts Jane. He uses her to lure Tarzan into a trap so that Mbonga can kill Tarzan for his son's death.Unlike previous ""Tarzan"" movies, ""True Blood's"" Alexander Skarsgård shuns the traditional loincloth. Instead, John Clayton retains his European apparel and eventually sheds everything but his breeches. In this respect, he resembles the Incredible Hulk more than Burroughs' protagonist. Aside from this departure, ""The Legend of Tarzan"" remains largely faithful to the literary character and his heritage. Meanwhile, Yates and scenarists Adam Cozad of ""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"" and Craig Brewer of ""Black Snake Moan"" don't exploit the African tribal characters for comic relief. Although she is abducted by Rom, Jane Clayton doesn't behave like the conventional, lily-livered, damsel-in-distress, and she displays contempt for Rom because he expects her to act like one. The CGI of the great apes is truly spectacular. Happily, Yates didn't resort to men in monkey suits. Visually, the scenery is as gorgeous as the cinematography is impressive. The explosive showdown between Tarzan and Rom is comparable to a James Bond extravaganza. Anybody who loves Edgar Rice Burroughs and his immortal hero should swing in to watch ""The Legend of Tarzan.""",The Legend of Tarzan
16,grantss,Craptacular,2,22 April 2017,"Belgian Congo, late-1800s. The Belgian government is hoping to find diamonds in the Congo in order to shore up its shaky national economy. Their plan hits a roadblock when a powerful local tribe rises up against them. However, the chief says he will lead them to the diamonds if they deliver to him one man - Tarzan. Meanwhile, John Clayton, the Fifth Earl of Greystoke, is living in England with his wife, Jane. He was born and raised in the Congo where he was known as...Tarzan. Now the Belgian government requests that he return to the Congo...Incredibly bad. Weak, clumsy plot that is really just an excuse for mindless action scenes. Dialogue is particularly nauseating, trite and hokey. Characters are starkly one-dimensional - dumb, fascist colonial, bullying white people vs brave, defending-their-land natives. Clearly one of the target audiences was Social Justice Warriors...So-so performances - Samuel L Jackson is particularly hammy and irritating.Other than gouging money out of dumb SJWs (a business practice I support, by the way, so maybe the movie does have one positive quality), the aim seems to be to pull in female audiences through the majority of the movie consisting of Alexander Skarsgard running around without his shirt on. Similarly, the presence of Margot Robbie for male audiences (hell, that's why I watched it!).

While Leopold is referred to many times in TARZAN, and precipitates all the slaughter, he is never seen on screen. Christoph Waltz stands in as Leopold's representative, and he symbolizes Radical Roman Terrorism (RRT) by always fingering the Madagascar Spider Silk Rosary/Garrot with which he slays his most prominent victims. Warner provides many indications that Waltz's character also is standing in for American President-Elect Donald J. Trumpenstein, who's already released the names of the Radical Roman Terrorists he plans to pack onto the U.S. Supreme Court. Led by the Trumpster, the RRT plan to exterminate the planet's remaining lions, tigers, and bears, not to mention dolphins, whales, gorillas, gators, and elephants under their radical ""Humans First"" interpretation of ""scriptures"" they've distorted beyond recognition. (God appointed Adam and his descendants such as Noah to serve as our Holy Zookeepers until America's ""City on the Hill"" could pass the World's Endangered Species Law.)

19,neil-476,A missed opportunity,7,23 May 2018,"The first live-action Tarzan movie to hit cinemas since Christopher Lambert played our boy in Greystoke, The Legend Of Tarzan has its moments but, overall, doesn't quite hit the mark.John Clayton, Lord Greystoke, has been retired from Tarzanning for the best part of a decade, living with wife Jane in a stately heap and attending the House Of Lords, when American busybody George Washington Williams (a real-life person, or so I read) persuades him to return in order to scope out improvements King Leopold of Belgium has made in the Congo. Meanwhile, baddie Leon Rom is seeking to obtain massive diamonds for nearly bankrupt Belgium from Opar: Chief Mbonga demands Tarzan be given to him as the price.I have read a number of Burroughs Tarzan novels, and I have probably seen the majority of the many, many Tarzan movies over the years, and I have always felt a little saddened that none of the screen versions has really captured the noble savage portrayed in the novels. Sadly, that shortcoming has not been addressed here.Like Greystoke (Hugh Hudson, 1984), it addresses Tarzan's origin, but it does so by intercutting it with the main narrative without any device to say ""this is current, this is flashback"", so you often aren't sure that you are actually watching a flashback until it's over.The story itself is simple, albeit there is arguably a bit too much of it (the Belgium connection adds an unnecessary political complication: ""Ooh, I know, let's bring Belgium into the plot!"" is an odd notion to get greenlit at a story conference), and its presentation is somewhat jumbled.Of the four principals, Alexander Skarsgard looks great but doesn't really sell Tarzan as a character, Christoph Waltz is Blofeld, Samuel L Jackson is completely 21st century, and Margot Robbie is a joyful, sexy, feisty Jane.The action is great, particularly the finale, but there is a great deal of dullness to sit through before we get to it.And, worst of all, much of the film is - as is the fashion - very dark, and all of it is presented - as is also the fashion - in washed out colours - the England scenes are all dark grey, the African scenes are either ochre (out on the veldt) or dark muddy khaki (in the jungle). 3D makes it even dimmer, to the extent that there are times when you actually can't see what's going on. Why cook up eye-boggling visuals, and then prevent your audience from seeing them?There are undoubtedly worthwhile elements here but, as a long-time Tarzan fan (Books, comics, movies, TV), I have to record disappointment at this film. It could have been a lot better.",The Legend of Tarzan

Focusing on the part of Tarzan's life where most Edgar Rice Burroughs adaptations end,the writers largely focus on Tarzan's time away from the jungle.Whilst this mode is a rather fresh take on Tarzan,it does lead to vines of action and thrills being tangled up by a thin Adventure Drama of Tarzan trying to save the jungle,that suffers from the baddies plans not being able to see the woods for the trees.Swinging action scenes over the dry plot,director David Yates and cinematographer Henry Braham bask the jungle in a misty mountain top atmosphere,with the plodding CGI gorillas and human battles landing with a real thump,as slow-motion tracking shots crunch on Tarzan's punches as Rupert Gregson-Williams terrific score curls round the bullet fire Tarzan faces.Joined by a lively spinning Christoph Waltz as Leon Rom, Samuel (yel)L. Jackson shakes the trees with his thunderous, bombastic performance as George Washington Williams.Pushing any guy away who thinks she needs ""help"" due to being a girl,sexy Margot Robbie gives Jane a toughness which proudly makes Jane her own action hero.Taking the role due to his dad being a fan of the Johnny Weissmuller's Tarzan flicks, Alexander Skarsgård shows a powerful oomph in the action scenes,with Skarsgård intense workout paying off in the flexibly he shows in his sweet performance,as the legendary Tarzan swings into the jungle.",The Legend of Tarzan

With the exception of a couple of films, this summer has been one of the worst I've known in almost sixteen years.

However, he soon clashes with a greedy Belgian captain who has sinister plans for his old home......Of all the reboots that Tarzan has gone through, this is by far the most expensive, and the most puerile version I've ever seen. And I'm including that turgid CG monstrosity from a few years ago, and even Tarzan in Manhatten.Skarsgård may have the monopoly on small screen vampires, but when it comes to the big screen, he has no presence, and here, he just seems to let his six pack do all the work. Honestly, his CG swinging counterpart has more life than anything he does in this.Waltz is on bad guy autopilot, and as much as I think he's a wonderful actor, he needs to stay away from big budget dreck like this, or his reputation will become tainted.Jackson, well he does what he always does, steals any scene he's in with anyone, but puts very little effort into it, as his character is only in it so Tarzan can get to the big fight at the end.The CG animals are okay, but we only saw that a couple of months previous with the phenomenal Jungle Book, so you'll keep referring back to that film whenever you see an animal.

22,Wuchakk,"The true 'sequel' to ""Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan,"" 32 freakin' years later",7,13 August 2016,"Released in 2016 and directed by David Yates, ""The Legend of Tarzan"" stars Alexander Skarsgårda as John Clayton (Tarzan), Margot Robbie as Jane and Samuel L. Jackson as Tarzan's American friend. The events take place a decade after Tarzan & Jane leave Africa for England with brief flashbacks to the ape man's origins. Christoph Waltz co-stars as the villain, Rom, who enslaves blacks in the Congo to mine the diamonds of Opar. Tarzan, Jane and Willliams (Jackson) aim to set things aright.""Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes"" (1984) was the best modern Tarzan movie, and one of my favorites despite a somewhat lethargic second half (and an irritating overuse of the ""Ooo, ooo, ooo""ape vocalization, which this movie thankfully only does once). Unfortunately, they dropped the ball with the sequel, 1998's ""Tarzan and the Lost City"" with Casper Van Dien in the title role, as it was just half-baked, a quickly-thrown-together ""sequel"" to presumably steal some of the thunder of Disney's animated version that was coming out the next year.""The Legend of Tarzan"" comes across as the true sequel to ""Greystoke,"" albeit with an altogether different cast and understandably so, seeing as how it's 32 years later. The portrayal of the lost city of Opar is different from the books. There's no hot High Priestess La (a blond white female) or ape-like denizens. The Oparians in the movie are just an intimidating black tribe covered with white body paint, but this is no big letdown because changes are to be expected when transferring to a different medium and, besides, Opar doesn't play that big of a role, at least not the city itself.In any case, I found this to be a solid Tarzan movie with a serious adult tone mixing drama, jungle adventure and unbelievable action. I was thankful for the thoughtful lulls in the story, which shed insights on the characters or conveyed the wonders of nature, like when Tarzan communes with an elephant at night or when Williams honestly confesses about his past mistakes as a youth where he feels he's not so different from the odious Rom. Moreover, Margot expertly brings Jane to life and is easily one of the better Janes in the movies. The CGI animals are great, especially the powerhouse apes.The film runs 110 minutes and was shot, believe it or not, in England with aerial shots done in Gabon (West of the Congo).GRADE: B",The Legend of Tarzan

Treating the story as more of an historical drama rather than just a jungle movie, this version of Tarzan is smart, well scripted, beautifully photographed (Henry Braham), and boasts an excellent cast of actors.The film opens with wondrously beautiful images of the African jungles over which is superimposed the history of the story we are about to experience. John Clayton (the magnificently sculpted hunk Alexander Skarsgård) following his parents' death in Africa was raised by an ape being called Tarzan, left Africa to go to his parents' home in England along with the woman he fell in love with and married, Jane Porter (Margot Robbie). Living in London is asked by Belgian King Leopold to go to Africa to see what he has done there to help the country. Though at first refusing to leave the comforts of England, he eventually agrees when a Black American, George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) wants him to accept so he can accompany him, stating that Leopold might be committing all sorts of atrocities to achieve his goal of the slave trade: Williams must prove the corruption. Clayton agrees and his wife insists that she accompany him because she misses Africa. The trio goes to Africa, but when they arrive they meet a man - Rom (Christoph Waltz) - who works for Leopold, they are attacked and captured. With Washington's help John/Tarzan escapes and sets out to rescue Jane by going across the jungle with Washington. Yes everyone knows the story, but it is the telling and the timely emphasis on the cruelties of slavery that make the film more poignant.

There is no way that a human being would take high value scenes, filled with expensive CGI animals and famous actors and mess up so much.First of all, this is a sort of a sequel. It starts with Tarzan being a British lord who is lured under false pretenses to the Congo. He has to run with the wild to save his pretty wife who had been kidnapped by evil villain. And if this wasn't enough to make you gag, he is accompanied by a Black American agent that came to investigate human rights abuses in the Belgian controlled African region. Because Americans are the good guys in all this...The actors were OK, but they had absolutely nothing to work with. Skarsgård played well this silent muscular man who seems ill at ease as a British lord and would rather commune with animals. Waltz is always a fun villain, even if his lines had the subtleties of Tin- Tin in the Congo comics. Even Sam Jackson was OK, since his role was to talk a lot.

27,sddavis63,Typical Action/Adventure Stuff Using The Tarzan Legend As Its Basis,4,30 August 2018,"Too often, the ""stars"" of ""The Legend Of Tarzan"" become the CGI generated animals - which was unfortunate, because I thought the CGI effects were uneven and I was never even for a moment led to think that any of the various apes we were seeing were real. Mind you, I suppose the alternative would have been men in ape suits, so the use of the CGI is understandable. It's just that it wasn't very well done but it effectively took over the movie at times. Aside from that, this is essentially little more than a typical action/adventure movie using the Tarzan legend as its basis. The basics of that legend (as written by Edgar Rice Burroughs) are offered via flashbacks scattered throughout. That made the movie a bit choppy to be honest, and for the most part the flashbacks weren't necessary - although the one is which we discover the fate of Tarzan's ape ""mother"" did finally explain why Chief Mbongo was so fixated on capturing Tarzan.As the story opens, Lord Greystoke (Tarzan) is comfortably settled in England as a member of the House of Lords. But the story revolves around the desire of King Leopold of Belgium to rape the Congo of its diamonds and to enslave its people to build the necessary railroad, with Greystoke being sent by the British government to investigate things, accompanied by Jane and an American envoy. Leopold and Belgium were represented by the character of Leon Rom, who had some ambitions of his own that he wanted to fulfil, and the British are shown to be involved in this exercise of colonial privilege as well. There's nothing incredibly special about the story. It is just typical action/adventure, revolving around unbelievable special effects. But you know that there's a confrontation coming between Rom and Tarzan, and you stick with this (even if it is a bit ho-hum) to watch when they finally meet.The performances weren't anything to write home about although Christoph Waltz, I thought, was pretty good as Rom. Rom was a complex character, and Waltz managed to portray him as both menacing and at times charming. Otherwise, Alexander Skarsgard as Greystoke/Tarzan, Margot Robbie as Jane and Samuel L. Jackson as the American Dr. Williams were all right. Skarsgard and Robbie really had surprisingly few scenes together, so didn't really seem to develop much chemistry.This was really nothing special.

28,Hellmant,"If you really love animals, it's hard not to appreciate a film like this.",8,8 July 2016,"'THE LEGEND OF TARZAN': Four Stars (Out of Five) The newest film adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' legendary character 'Tarzan'; who first appeared in the novel 'Tarzan of the Apes', in 1912 (it was followed by 25 sequels). This movie tells the story of Tarzan's return to the African jungle (where he was raised by apes), after adapting to a civilized life in London. He's called back to investigate the corrupt activities of a Belgian King there, and then he's lured into a trap by a tribal chief. The film stars Alexander Skarsgard, in the title role, and it costars Samuel L. Jackson, Margot Robbie, Christoph Waltz and Djimon Hounsou. It was directed by David Yates (who also helmed the last four 'HARRY POTTER' movies) and it was written by Adam Cozad and Criag Brewer (who also wrote and directed 'BLACK SNAKE MOAN', starring Jackson). The movie is packed with beautiful visuals, and some pretty decent action scenes; it's definitely a lot better than the critics would like you to believe.John Clayton III, also known as Tarzan (Skarsgard), was raised by apes in the African Congo jungle; after his parents were murdered by other (more vicious) primates. As an adult, Tarzan meets a woman, named Jane Porter (Robbie), and the two marry and move to London together. Tarzan becomes totally adapted to the civilized world, but he's later asked to return to his home; by a Belgian king. Initially Tarzan rejects the idea, but an American, named George Washington Williams (Jackson), persuades him to accept the offer. Williams believes the king is enslaving the people there, and he wants proof of it.The movie had a budget of $180 million; and you can see just about all of it, up on screen (the visuals are breathtaking). Skarsgard is a pretty flawless Tarzan (especially his amazing physique), and I really enjoyed the movie's darker (more adult) tone; compared to most of the 'Tarzan' movies I grew up with. The film is a little slow-paced, at times, but it's mostly a lot of fun. It's also a great movie for animal lovers, much like 'THE JUNGLE BOOK' (from a couple months ago).

Tarzan is accompanied by George Washington Williams (Samuel L Jackson) and, against his wishes, his wife Jane (Margot Robbie). Soon after their arrival in Africa, Jane is kidnapped by a man named Rom (Christoph Waltz). Rom has a plan to turn Tarzan over to an African chief, Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou), who wants to see Tarzan punished for the death of his son. Rom intends to use Jane as bait to lure Tarzan into Mbonga's hands for a fortune in diamonds in return. As you'd expect, Tarzan sets out to rescue Jane.My little, poorly written plot summary for The Legend of Tarzan actually makes the film sound better than it is. The plot here is paper thin. A lot of what goes on makes no sense at all and characters generally behave in an irrational fashion with little motivation. All are 2D characters without much depth. The showdown between Tarzan and Mbonga should have been a highlight. Instead, it's one of weakest sequences in the film. It's over before it begins. It's frustrating to watch a film that could and should have been much better had anyone spent more time developing a solid and compelling story.Beyond my issues with the plot, I wasn't crazy about the film's structure. Parts of the story are told in a series of increasingly frustrating flashbacks. Most of the flashbacks relate to Tarzan's origin story - something that felt unnecessary to include in this movie. Not only are the flashbacks annoying but they do a pretty poor job of explaining a backstory we're all familiar with. They only serve to bloat the film and unnecessarily increase the runtime.The acting is all over the place. Skarsgård makes for a weak Tarzan. Oddly, he seems uninterested throughout most of the movie. Robbie really doesn't have much to do and is wasted. Jackson does what he usually does - he plays Williams just like every other character he plays. He seems horribly miscast to me. Hounsou and Waltz are the acting highlights for me. With more developed characters and better defined motivations, they're performances would have been even better.Even though I've already listed a number of negatives, the biggest weakness in The Legend of Tarzan is the overuse of some really bad looking CGI. Most of the animals look terrible. The gorillas, lions, wildebeests (especially the wildebeests) - none of them look convincing. There's not a ""real"" looking animal to be found in the entire movie. But the worst example of poor CGI can be seen in Tarzan's swing through the trees. A hand drawn cartoon would have looked more realistic. It's some of the worst CGI I've seen. And speaking of Tarzan swinging through the trees - the whole notion is ridiculous. Tarzan goes from one conveniently placed vine to the next at a speed that would have made a cheetah envious. It's insulting. Despite everything I've written, it's obvious from my rating that I didn't find the entire film a total flop. There are moments here and there that work - Rom's diner scene with Jane being one example. So even though I've spent several paragraphs discussing the issues I had with The Legend of Tarzan, I'm still rating the film a 4/10.",The Legend of Tarzan

However, I'm not exactly a ""Tarzan"" fan and I didn't expect that 2016 was ripe for a remake of an old story like this. I just wasn't very interested. But I am nothing if not a movie fanatic and decided to try it anyways after reading a woman's comedic review that was hilarious. Now I wish I had ignored everything and saw this first thing. This would have been a great summer adventure in the theatre maybe even in 3D. The Legend of Tarzan is fun, intense, thorough and original when you consider how they approach the Tarzan story with Tarzan returning to his jungle to save it. It almost tries too hard with a complex political story but it makes sense overall. Flashbacks to Tarzan's origin story feel very empty and hollow unfortunately but it is a good way to tell a new story while still doing the origins. The effects in the film are...good...ish? Sometimes I felt like the CGI was horrible and then other times it added to the style and quality of the film to see the lush greenery and CGI animals. This is a very different side of Tarzan with some strong performances and good action.Alexander Skarsgård takes up the lead and unfortunately he doesn't quite have the strong screen presence necessary to carry the film. He plays the role well, looks the part, his physique is obviously mind blowing but the brooding and angry Tarzan is too underwhelming to feel heroic. Still he does decently. Hollywood's up and coming latest It Girl, Margot Robbie steals the show as Jane. She is very very good but her chemistry with Skarsgård is lacking definitely. Still the story focuses more on her and she plays the strong damsel in distress well. Christoph Waltz as your villain? OK well immediately that makes this watchable. The man is amazing and he is the perfect villain for any film. His chemistry opposite Robbie in their scenes are fantastic. He is also a scene stealer obviously. Samuel L Jackson...in another movie...and once again I can't say anything bad about him. He is just...Samuel L Jackson and he plays this role well and has a good part and he doesn't overshadow anyone and how are we not sick of this man yet? He is that good! Djimon Hounsou is an amazing character actor has an unfortunately small role in the film that I think they could have done more with but much like Waltz and Jackson, he ups the ante of any cast.Maybe The Legend of Tarzan wasn't what people wanted or expected. I had no expectations or had low expectations but the film was a lot of fun and serious and well filmed. It had the feel of a superhero film but also a period piece, romance (although the romance was lacking), and I think it probably lived up to the Tarzan name. David Yates is a fantastic visual director. His Harry Potter films were some of the best and I think he really loves to tell an adventure. He shot this really well and the scenery is something to behold. The film is really entertaining for the first hour and a bit but then absolutely takes off when Tarzan returns to full...swing...ha! Let's be clear, the ape looks awful. A full on animated Ape like George of The Jungle would have looked more realistic and it sort of ruined certain scenes especially the kick butt battle between the two of them. If you can get past some of the disgustingly awful special effects then you see a lot of heart in the film. When it's all said and done, have fun with this, enjoy it! Give it the time! It's not Oscar worthy but it's thoroughly entertaining and that fills the need. 7.5/10",The Legend of Tarzan

Because all the joy is sucked out, it just becomes this lifeless Hollywood husk that doesn't do away with the silly stuff but masks it in all this over-serious schlock - including a substance-less slavery plot, the inclusion of which is an attempt to add some phoney importance to what should undoubtedly be a 'popcorn flick' - in what seems to be an effort to simply ruin your day. On top of all that, the vine-swinging action you'd expect is largely absent or neutered, save for a few full-blown seconds just before the end-credits, and the majority of the other fights are poorly shot and choppily edited while also relying far too heavily on CGI to be at all tangible. This is something the feature struggles with as a whole, using perhaps more digital characters and sets than practical ones. It's just so utterly boring and joyless. Not a good time. 4/10",The Legend of Tarzan
33,ThomasDrufke,Lord of the Apes,7,30 June 2016,"The story of Tarzan is so ingrained into the brains of moviegoers that it's difficult to really put a new stamp or add something fresh to something so well-known. While Legend of Tarzan certainly attempts to take a new approach structurally, it never swings off the screen as gracefully as I had hoped.2016 has been a rough year for big budgeted films. So many bombs and duds overshadow some of the great ones we've had through the first half. This film isn't necessarily in either camp. It begins the second half of this year with a formidable installment in the long-running ape-man franchise. David Yates, director of the last four Harry Potter films, does absolutely nothing special with the characters of Tarzan and Jane, but I was nonetheless entertained by the film from beginning to end.Alexander Skarsgård and Margot Robbie portray Tarzan and Jane respectively. Both give solid performances but neither brought anything new to the characters. It took me awhile to adapt to Skarsgård's more guarded portrayal. In fact, for a good portion of the first half, I found his performance to be quite stiff. Tarzan isn't supposed to be running around cracking jokes, but I would have liked to have seen a bit more lightness to him. Although Robbie is very good as Jane, she doesn't get a whole lot to do as she's tied up by the villainous Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) for half the film. She's far from a damsel in distress, because she's definitely not helpless, but the plot constantly puts her in position to be a device or Tarzan's motivation to do something. I think Robbie could have done something special given the chance.Undeniably good, however, is everything to do with the apes. I've seen the backstory before, but I loved watching his ever-changing relationship with his family of apes and the various flashbacks to what came before Tarzan's venture into home life in England. It's also where the film succeeds the most visually. While some animals, including a pretty bad ostrich, are weak on CGI, the apes are animated tremendously. The cinematography through the jungle and in the African mountains is quite beautiful. However, there are several moments of awful green screen footage. I'm talking cringe worthy background visuals.Having said all this, I was definitely invested in the story they were telling. Tarzan is thrust into a choice to return home and chaos ensues when Leon Rom, a corrupt Belgian captain who tricked him into returning to the Congo in the first place. At times the tone blurs the lines from taking its source material too seriously and supplementing it with some weak dialogue with an average romance. I think that's the best way to describe most of the film, average.I appreciate the filmmakers approach in taking the Tarzan story in a different direction in having it be about his return home and to his animalistic ways. But the best part about this film is Tarzan's relationship to his ape family and the background to that. I would have just liked to see more of that side of things rather than just bits and pieces here or there. Christoph Waltz was exactly what I needed out of a Tarzan villain and Samuel L. Jackson's humorous sidekick to Tarzan worked seamlessly. To me, there's plenty good here, but there was potential for greatness.+Solid performances from the leads+Samuel L added some much needed humor+Apes Apes Apes+Some visuals and fight scenes-Others were too noticeably green screen-Struggles to balance tone at times-Needed more apes7.4/10",The Legend of Tarzan
34,MLDinTN,so many plot holes,2,17 March 2017,"This movie is plagued by plot holes. One minute they are in England, next they are walking on a plain in Africa with George(Sam Jackson). They are supposed to be going to the Congo. There aren't plains there. Plus Congo isn't along the coast, you can't just walk there from port like the film implies. Gorillas don't fight like the movie shows. Plus if they did, they would tear a human apart. All the silliness of swinging on vines and landing on a train, being chased by a hippo. And Margot Robbie gives perhaps the worst performance of the year. Her dumb blank stare and perfect glistening skin all the while running through the jungle.FINAL VERDICT: One of the worst films of the year.

35,lesleyharris30,"Nothing Stands Out, Extremely Forgetful,",5,16 July 2016,"The Legend of Tarzan is a mediocre movie with a mostly well developed plot and a decent cast. It certainly has some great moments, such as Tarzan's brawl with the apes, Alexander Skarsgård suited the role nicely, Samuel L. Jackson delivers a performance different to anything he has done before, and plenty of tense scenes from Christoph Waltz, who steals the show as villain Leon Rom, truly bringing him to life. It never managed to feel necessary, it's the first Tarzan movie in years and yet there is nothing that tells us ""this is why we needed another Tarzan"" there is nothing special about it, nothing you would not see in any other film with this character.As well as that, the CGI is everywhere, making it come across as lazy, the production felt rushed, they should have taken the time to find real landscapes, develop real sets and hire real animals, this would have given the movie a more authentic feel, it clearly relied far too much on green screen and special effects, which did not help in making it any bit more compelling. Not without its moments of greatness, The Legend of Tarzan falls flat as a result of not being any bit unique, it offers nothing new to this franchise and is a forgetful affair, better off giving it a miss. Tarzan must return to his jungle life to save his people from a ruthless tycoon. Best Performance: Christoph Waltz / Worst Performance: Djimon Hounsou",The Legend of Tarzan
36,A_Different_Drummer,"(heavy sigh) It's OK, but it could have been great",7,10 July 2016,"The core Tarzan story is not only iconic, it speaks to something deep within us. It is at the same time the ultimate Romance and the ultimate Action tale. It is no coincidence that, almost a century ago, when young Hollywood looked to find a franchise for its new ""talkie"" motion pictures, they turned to the Tarzan tale, and spawned a franchise so successful that it literally outlived the shelf life of its star.In my lifetime I have seen well over a dozen versions, retellings and re-imaginings of the Tarzan story. I have no doubt that after I am gone, producers and writers will continue to be attracted to it and continue to ""make their bones"" by bending it to their unique style.That said, this one is not especially good. After a great opening scene, there is the filmic equivalent of ""dead air"" for about 35 minutes and when the script does finally get in gear it stumbles and falls, subject to a wildly disjointed narrative and equally bizarre editing.Alexander Skarsgård has been impressive in other films (a race driver, a superhero) and I think with different material and a different director he could have connected. Christoph Waltz and Sam Jackson remain two of the most over-exposed stars in Hollywood and, good as they are, they are running out of clever ways to play the same character over and over. And over.

Now Tarzan and Williams must travel to deepest Africa in order to not only save Jane, but save the slaves as well. This is a good movie that I enjoyed but started to get a little board with. The movie starts off decent but slowly began to lose speed. The fact that this was a different look at the same old story that has been told a thousand times really helps make the movie feel interesting and new.

38,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,7,12 October 2016,"The Legend of TarzanThe upside to being raised by apes is you keep your human friends lice free.Mind you, the simian reared aristocrat in this action-adventure abhors his heritage.Lord Greystoke (Alexander Skarsgård), née Tarzan, must return to the jungle he was marooned in as an infant to prevent its enslavement at the hands of the Belgium King who has deployed an evil envoy (Christoph Waltz) to reap it riches.Accompanied by his wife Jane (Margot Robbie) and an American businessman (Samuel L. Jackson), the ape-man soon learns he was really lured back by a vengeful chieftain (Djimon Hounsou).Despite some questionable special effects and a few bad one-liners, Legend is the most comprehensive and visually thrilling interpretation of Edgar Rice Burroughs' character yet. Moreover, it finally adds a self-reliant Jane to the mainly misogynistic mythos.Fortunately, when your in-laws are apes you don't have to set your bathroom standards so high.

39,851222,Disappointing,6,26 December 2016,"Greetings from Lithuania.Given the budget ($180,000,000), people in front and behind camera - ""The Legend of Tarzan"" (2016) is a disappointing flick. They should have spent more time and effort into the story itself, which isn't bad but nothing really great and the script which lacked any interesting lines or more involving dialog and etc. Directing by David Yates wasn't the best either - this movie at its running time 1 h 40 min dragged and i did checked my watch more then three times during the second half of this movie. Special effects were pretty good, but unfortunately not as great as they were in ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"" (2014) - far from it. Although movie does looks good, some good cinematography and great looking nature does help it.Overall, ""The Legend of Tarzan"" (2016) is pretty forgettable movie, not tightly paced one and lacks more involving and polished story and script. Although it looks good, that is pretty much the best thing about it. It is not a bad movie by any means, but it is not a good one either.",The Legend of Tarzan
40,atlasmb,A Beautiful Film That Adds To The Legend,9,20 July 2016,"I did not see this film in IMAX or 3-D because the local theater did not offer them. But I could see how they might enhance the experience.And what an experience it is. The spectacle that Edgar Rice Burroughs created in the minds of his readers found expression on the big screen. Personally, I chose to view the film in those terms--not superimposing current-day politics, but remembering the mythology of the Burroughs tales and how they must have inspired his fans. At its core, Tarzan is about the wonderment and mystery of a human raised by apes, able to communicate with animals and capable of ""flying"" through the jungle canopy.As such, I will evaluate this film's various elements:CAST: 10: The actor who plays Tarzan needs to be a physical presence on screen. Though this film does not ask Tarzan/Lord Greystoke to cavort in a loincloth, he clearly has the physique for it. This film may do for Alexander Skarsgard's career what ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" did for Margot Robbie's. Speaking of Robbie, her personification of Jane Porter, Greystoke's wife/mate, is perfection. Maybe Angelina Jolie could have matched her beautiful physicality a few years ago, but otherwise she is unmatchable in her portrayal of the woman who loves Africa and the man it gave her even more than her place among the salons and galleries of England.STORY: 9: The film begins eight years after Lord Greystoke has returned to claim his title in England. As he and Jane journey back to and through the Congo, the story of how Tarzan lived among the apes and met Jane is told in flashback. It works seamlessly.VILLAIN: 10: Christoph Waltz is perfect as Leon Rom, the man with a plan to subjugate an entire country for mercenary reasons.CINEMATOGRAPHY: 10: The beautiful scenery is one of the strengths of this film. Every scene is lovingly filmed and created with an eye for artistic composition.ACTION SCENES: 9: The balance between quiet moments and moments of extreme action is finely tuned to accent, say, the deep love between Lord and Lady Greystoke or the maleficent intent of Rom.SPECIAL EFFECTS: 8: We have been conditioned to expect scenes that are real looking though they do not exist in reality. It is with such a keen expectation that I grade this element an 8, though most of the action is remarkably convincing.MUSIC: 9: Like most good scores, this one was rarely noticed. It complemented the action and the beautiful panoramas.This is an impressive film, recreating the awe of Burrough's original readers, who could only see such images in their imagination. Though some viewers have chosen to impose their political views upon the film, it should be viewed, as its title reminds us, as a legend.",The Legend of Tarzan
41,The-Sarkologist,Pretty Dull,3,16 July 2016,"Well, he we have another film that looked vaguely interesting on the trailers but turned out to be really boring. Well, there must have been quite a few people wanting to see it though because there were a number of sessions at my local cinema that had sold out, and I ended up purchasing the ticket the night before so I didn't have to waste my time walking all the way to the cinema only to discover that it had sold out again. Well, I didn't waste my time in that regard, but I do feel that I did waste my time sitting in that cinema for two hours watching a film that I really couldn't get all that excited about.The story of Tarzan was the creation of Edgar Rice Burroughs, and is about a man who grew up in the jungle among the apes, went back to civilisation, hated it, and returned to the jungle. When he was first in the jungle, and the main reason he returned to civilisation, was because he met and fell in love with Jane. This film, however, begins after he has returned to England and settled down. However King Leopold of Belgium is bankrupt and is looking for ways to get so money, so he sends this guy to the Congo to establish an ivory and diamond trade. The catch is that in doing so he is going to eventually destroy the Congo.There are a number of flash backs to when Tarzan was first in the jungle, and how he eventually meets Jane (and also how he became Tarzan, namely that his parents were killed by apes, but he was rescued as a baby). We also discover that he has made some enemies, namely because he killed the son of a tribal chief so as to protect his ape parents. This all comes together to a grand finale when a horde of wilder beasts run through a Belgium sea port and they eventually drive the Belgians out of the Congo.As I said, the film was pretty boring, and Tarzan himself was actually really annoying. In fact I really couldn't stand the character – it just seems to be an excuse to have some guy swing around the trees on vines, and run around bare chested. We also had to have the token American Negro (who, if he had fought in the civil war, would probably be in his fifties by the time the movie was set, and he certainly didn't look all that old). Obviously, this was all about how he had come here to expose Leopold's crimes in the Congo, and to also free the natives from slavery.No doubt this film touches on a lot of issues – such as the rape and pillaging of the Congo by the Western powers. Even though it is a sovereign country, it is till one of the most dangerous places in the world, and that is if you stay inside Kinshasa – out in the jungle it is even worse. The film explores ivory trade, western imperialism, and of course the exploitation of the natives. However it also has this hero – Tarzan – come swinging out of the trees to save everybody. In the end this film was pretty dull, and I think I'll just go back to watching the Avengers movie.",The Legend of Tarzan
42,Reno-Rangan,"Yep, this is a different Tarzan, an updated one.",6,14 October 2016,"Recently the Indian jungle boy, the live-action Mowgli film was made and so its time for Africa's. This is not a Disney film and that's one of the disappointments for the Tarzan fans. Because this film is for the grown-ups only. It is rated PG13, but still I don't think the children would enjoy it like they did for the recent 'The Jungle Book' film. So it is like a DC film, I mean, DC makes superhero films for the grown-ups, unlike Marvel's. The bottom line is, don't expect it to be like a Disney film. Like the director said before the release, this is not the Tarzan from your father, grandfather's era, but an updated one with strong graphic violence.So the story skips all the Tarzan's earlier life like from his childhood to adulthood parts. The film commences with Tarzan being settled in the UK. It's the second half of the 19th century, where the European colonies in the Africa are expanding for its rich natural resources. So in the Congo savanna, the natives welcome Tarzan for his short visit, but the things get ugly when his wife, Jane was kidnapped. Now he must fight back for her safe return and also avert other threats in the region from the foreign power.There are many CGI character films were made at the recent time, it is a trend, but not all of them are impressive. This film looked average when it comes to vfx. The story was acceptable, the performances were decent, the casting too not bad, but Samuel L. Jackson was completely useless. He's one of the greatest sidekick Hollywood ever produced, but I don't know why he's in this project, his role was very silly.In other hand, Alexander Skarsgard was good in the lead character and so Margot Robbie as Jane. The action sequences were not good as I expected. The film had a good runtime, but in some parts, it was slow or maybe you can say nothing interesting thing happens. I liked the idea, to update the theme, but they should have given more focus on the story. I hope if they plan another film, it should be a prequel. Because I feel there's lots to learn about the past than going forward. This is a one time watchable film, there's no surprises, just plain and partially entertaining.6/10",The Legend of Tarzan

When Tarzan returns to the jungle its being invaded by poachers, scvangers and the so called slave trade is in progress.The movie has a full on grey feel when you watch it.

45,tomgillespie2002,Lifeless and uninspiring,4,1 February 2017,"As one of the great iconic characters of cinema, it seems like Tarzan, Lord of Greystoke has been absent from our cinema screens for an incredibly long time. While the character may have seen his fair share of ups and downs over the last few decades - even Disney's 1999 effort is one of their least fondly-remembered films in what was a prosperous and defining era for the House of Mouse - the famous tale of the vine-swinging white man raised by apes in Africa seemed ripe for a re-imagining in our anything-is-possible times. It took 17 years for the Lord of the Apes to re-appear, but is the character still relevant? And is it possible to deliver a fresh, original take on such a familiar and old-fashioned story?For the first 20 minutes of David Yates' film, it would seem yes. Wisely opting to begin with Tarzan - here played stoically by Alexander Skarsgard - already back in England and going by his birth name John Clayton, the film avoids having to repeat the old ""me Tarzan, you Jane"" shtick well all know so well. He's a bit of a legendary figure, famous for his huge hands that have been gradually restructured after so many years running on all limbs. He is also married to Jane (Margot Robbie), the fiery woman he fell in love with back in the jungle. Eager to leave the past behind him. Tarzan finds himself heading back to the Congo when the Prime Minister (Jim Broadbent) requests that he travel there to report on the actions of Belgium's King Leopold. After initially declining, he agrees when American envoy George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) voices his beliefs that the Belgians are in fact slaving the Congolese natives.It's an interesting, topical start, and one that, at first at least, seems to be addressing the issue of how the tale of a white man swinging in to the save the day for his African friends would go down in our politically correct times. It's just a terrible shame that the movie becomes so incredibly dull and rather uncomfortable to watch after such a promising start. Scriptwriters Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer seem convinced that simply acknowledging the issues of race and the stereotypical, one-dimensional role of its female lead means that they can get away with it. Jane literally states that she's not some damsel-in-distress before being carried away in much distress. While The Legend of Tarzan can be commended for being brave enough to tackle the topic of slavery, entwining images of shackled, beaten black men with CGI-laden high jinks is just plain insensitive.Still, the movie's main issue is that it's just so incredibly lifeless and uninspiring. After Tarzan arrives in Africa, Jane is kidnapped by Belgian envoy Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz), and the remainder of the plot revolves around rescuing her, with some animals in between. The fact that Jane spends most of her time trapped on a steamboat gives a decent impression of the film's pace. Perhaps we have been spoiled by the CGI mastery of Disney's The Jungle Book, but the special effects, especially involving the apes, simply aren't up to scratch, and even pale in comparison to 2011's Rise of the Planet of the Apes. One thing that certainly is real however, is Skarsgard's torso. Fair play to the guy, he's truly gone the whole nine yards, and does his best with a role that requires little other than physicality. I've enjoyed his work ever since I saw him in True Blood and later on Generation Kill, but if he is ever to become a star and allow his true charisma to shine through, he'll need better material than this.",The Legend of Tarzan
46,Thanos_Alfie,A nice movie...,6,4 December 2018,"""The Legend of Tarzan"" is an Action - Adventure movie in which we watch the story of Tarzan, a person who was raised by apes when his parents died in Africa. After some years left Africa and returned to his parents' home in England with the woman he fell in love with and married. When he is asked by Belgian King Leopold to go to Africa to see what he has done there to help the country and refuses to go an American wants him to accept the king's proposal so he can accompany him because he informs Tarzan that Leopold might be committing many crimes like slavery in order to achieve his goal.I liked this movie very much because of the plot which was simple but very interesting. The movie had very good visual effects and also descent CGI for that kind of movie. The direction which was made by David Yates was very good and I liked the way he presented the story of Tarzan and how he presented all the events of his life. I also liked the interpretations of Alexander Skarsgård who played as John Clayton / Tarzan and he was simply amazing and Margot Robbie who played as Jane Clayton and she was also very good at it. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned are Samuel L. Jackson's who played as George Washington Williams and Christoph Waltz's who played as Leon Rom.To sum up, I have to say that ""The Legend of Tarzan"" is a very good movie to watch because it combines very well the action scenes with romance and the presentation of the life of Tarzan from the present to the past and again to the present was very interesting.

47,eddie_baggins,Decent dumb fun,6,10 July 2016,"While it makes very little (if any) sense logic wise, this updating of Edgar Rice Burroughs seriously silly famous loin cloth wearing jungle man Tarzan or as his preferred to be known as here John Clayton/Lord Greystoke, is quite a bit of big dumb fun if you go along for the rope swinging ride and is an event that rollicks along at a neat pace not often found with modern day blockbuster of this type.Foregoing the usual origin story that has plagued remakes for many a moon, director David Yates uses his skills honed from his work on the final 4 Harry Potter films to deliver a $180 million dollar Legend of Tarzan that finds the big handed, muscle covered hero living a life in London with his beloved wife Jane (yes gentleman Margot Robbie is in this film) only to be drawn back into the worlds he chose to leave by a comic relief spurting Samuel L. Jackson (ramping up the street sass to 11) and yet another tiresome villain role from Christoph Waltz who is quickly becoming a self-parodying joke sadly.The actual plot of The Legend of Tarzan is entirely forgettable and wholly unnecessary and those seeking a more rags to riches tale of Lord Greystoke may be sorely disappointed but Yates keeps the action flowing and the visuals rich in airbrushed CGI encased goodness and there is simple joys to be found from Tarzan going toe to toe with a much bigger and stronger gorilla or watching on as Samuel L. Jackson dives headfirst into an oversized tree that keep the film watchable and enjoyable even though we really should know better.In regards to the films leads it must be said that Alexander Skarsgård doesn't exactly romp home with his role as the man monkey, body wise his clearly cut out for the gig but charisma wise and delivery wise he leaves much to be desired. Skarsgård's turn does increase a few notches whenever his on screen with Robbie's Jane however and the Australian actresses turn is another win for the rising star whose likely to reach all new levels of love when Suicide Squad bursts onto our screens in a few weeks' time.It won't be winning any awards and it most certainly won't be on anyone's end of year Best of Lists but The Legend of Tarzan is what it is, a fun, preposterous adventure based on downright ridiculous source materials that have been the bringer of many joys to various generations of those seeking a break from the run of the mill everyday grind. Something that we all need from time to time and something this newest Tarzan offers to all those willing to accept it for what it is.3 ear lobes out 5",The Legend of Tarzan
48,filipemanuelneto,"Generally positive, it is a film of hits and misses.",7,16 September 2021,"I'm not a fan of Tarzan, but I think there was a lack of a good movie to bring the character back to cinema after many years of absence. This absence ended, fortunately, with the appearance of this new film, which brings us the usual story, told in a new and different way. For me personally, it worked quite well, especially considering the lack of logic and verisimilitude underlying the story of a man abandoned in the African jungle and raised by gorillas as if he were one of them.In this film, Tarzan long ago left the African forests to take his place as Lord Greystoke. He is an aristocrat, he is perfectly used to the life of English society, and he married Jane. However, the British government asks him to return to Africa to look into what is happening in the Belgian Congo, where everyone suspects that slave labor is being used. He acquiesces to the request, but he doesn't know that it's everything the Belgians wanted, and that there's a trap waiting for him.One of the things I liked most about this film was seeing the same story told from another perspective: Tarzan is now an English nobleman who, deep down, doesn't want to go back to the jungle and lives badly with the celebrity that his origins bring him. I also enjoyed seeing the story placed in a precise historical context: the African partition between the European empires and the Belgian colonization of Congo, which brings very bad memories, for the brutality of the colonial regime imposed there by Leopold II, monarch who, virtually, treated the Congo as his own. The film is good, it was very well done and David Yates showed, once again, talent and determination, but he made a gross mistake in allowing so many sub-plots lost in the middle of the main story without this being fully justified.The film has a vast and luxurious cast, where we will find several illustrious names that have already proven themselves in cinema. This is the case of Alexander Skarsgaard, who was a good option to give life to Tarzan. He has charisma, he is elegant, and he adapted very well to the character and what he had to do. Christoph Waltz also looks flawless in the role of the villain, a cold, hard man who looks to no means to his ends. The actor has already shown, in previous works, that he is particularly good at villains of this style (I remember his work in ""Inglorious Bastards"", in a very similar character). Far less positive, Samuel L. Jackson's appearance sounds bad, as the actor is given a character who didn't have to appear there, and who seems to have been invented just to secure the actor a spot on the end credits. And I'd rather not to mention the bad choice for his character's name, which almost made me laugh out loud! Margot Robbie didn't strike me as suitable either, as she never behaves or acts like an aristocratic Victorian wife. She looks like what she is: a 21st century actress dressed in Victorian clothes. It would have been wiser for the production to choose another actress.Technically, the film has a very good cinematography, where color and light were very well-used. Alas, the overwhelming majority of the film relies on massive doses of high-quality, but still fake, CGI. The animals in CGI didn't seem realistic to me either, although that's a minor problem. It's a film of almost three hours in length, but I confess that I didn't have any major problems with it, despite sometimes observing, in the final third of the film, a more rushed and confusing editing work than would be acceptable. The sets and costumes, loaded with evocative notes of the time the film is set, worked very well and were one of the most absorbing facets here. The soundtrack works well, but it didn't stick in my ear, and I don't even consider it particularly striking.",The Legend of Tarzan
49,leonblackwood,A decent watch but not an all time classic! 6/10,6,5 November 2016,"Review: With so many Tarzan movies made over the years, this is definitely a different interpretation of the all time classic. Everyone is used to seeing Tarzan swinging on ropes, living in the jungle with the animals, and falling in love with Jane, which is in this movie but with a political element. The movie does look pretty spectacular and the animals and jungle setting, which was mostly CGI, does look real. Alexander Skarsgard plays Tarzan well and Christoph Waltz was brilliant as the villain but I would have preferred to have see the amazing journey of Tarzan in the jungle, than a movie about a corrupt political man, Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) who goes to the Congo with the British army, in search for some priceless diamonds. Whilst in the Congo, Leon and his army are ambushed by Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou), who is aware that he is there for the diamonds, so he agrees to give him the priceless gems, in exchange for Tarzan. Leon then uses his political connections to get Tarzan to the Congo, unaware that his wife Jane (Margot Robbie) and George Washington (Samuel L. Jackson) will be going with him, and when they attempt to capture Tarzan, he escapes with George but Jane is captures by Leon. The rest of the movie is basically about Tarzan saving Jane, with the help of the animals and sharp shooter, George. Its not a classic but it's a decent watch! There are some flashbacks about how John became Tarzan, which were more interesting than the movie itself but it still looked amazing, especially the fight between Tarzan and his vicious Gorilla who could have easily killed him. The ""swinging ropes"" scene looked extremely real and the love element was quite emotional but there was only a couple of scenes showing Tarzan's relationship with the animals, which was what the original story was mainly about. Anyway, it's definitely one to watch but I doubt that it will go down as an all time classic. Enjoyable!Round-Up: You can definitely see were the hefty budget went in this movie, and after making a decent profit at the box office, I wouldn't be surprised to see a sequel. The movie was directed by David Yates, 52, who also brought you Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 1 & 2 and his latest movie, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, which has a sequel scheduled for 2018. Judging by his previous work, he certainly knows how to tackle big budget movies, so he was the perfect choice for this film. I personally think that this should have been the sequel, and that the first Tarzan should have been about him growing up in the jungle. With that aside, I'm glad that Samuel L. Jackson added to some wit to the abnormal journey and I couldn't have seen anyone else playing Leon as well as Christoph Waltz. After watching the Revenant bear fighting scene, which shocked the hell out of me, this was a decent attempt by David, in terms of realism and cinematography but I still was expecting more from the overall concept.Budget: $180million Worldwide Gross: $357millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/dramas, starring Alexander Skarsgard, Christoph Waltz, Samuel L. Jackson, Margot Robbie, Rory J. Saper, Djimon Hounsou, Jim Broadbent, Ben Chaplin, Genevieve O'Reilly and Casper Crump. 6/10",The Legend of Tarzan
50,TheMovieDiorama,Roars onto the screen as a great spectacle.,8,9 July 2016,"Another film about Tarzan but this time with a bigger budget, The Legend of Tarzan is about the feral man who was raised in the jungles of Congo and has now returned to stop the Belgians from starting a war and taking over the country. Straight up, this is a depressing dark take on the Tarzan story...I'm talking moody, death, animal death and more death. That aside however, I thoroughly enjoyed this film (I am a sucker for darker films). The majority of the cast were good with Samuel L Jackson and Christoph Waltz being exceptional to Alexander Skarsgard being...meh, he does the job fine. A much needed comic relief from Jackson's character, the script is nothing spectacular. The real shining star is the cinematography, it's superb. Lush jungle landscapes to the urban town of Boma, director David Yates knows that this is a film to showcase the visual talent of Henry Braham (who is working on 2 new upcoming Marvel films, so keep an eye out). The CGI can be noticeable at times but it's not enough to take you out of the film, and the film tries to pull your emotional strings but does not work all the time. Overall, this is a solid blockbuster and a much darker tale of Tarzan that tries to be too emotive but cannot necessarily reach those heights.

51,Tweetienator,No-one Beats Weissmuller,4,2 August 2016,"Imo the pace of the story is too slow and to sum it up a typical contemporary Hollywood adventure movie - no surprise here, no risk taking. Compared to Indiana Jones movies (at least the three first ones) this is at most a mediocre flick. In short: I would prefer ANY Tarzan movie with Johnny Weissmuller over this flick, the only interesting character plays Christoph Waltz again, but compared to his great roles like in Inglorious Basterds and The Hateful Eight or Unchained even he looks a little ""too professional done"". This meal misses spice, lots of. Considering the potential the character and story of Tarzan provide this is a rather weak flick. cinematics and stuff are pro, CGI meh. Tbh, I don't know how one can f*** up such a great franchise like Tarzan with such a redundant output.",The Legend of Tarzan
52,Vartiainen,This isn't the Tarzan I know,5,30 June 2017,"Yet another adaptation of the classic Edgar Rice Burroughs character. And to this film's credit, it's nice to see an adaptation of another Tarzan book aside from Tarzan of the Apes. If only they didn't ruin the character in the process.It's somewhat noticeable that the Wikipedia article for this movie doesn't refer to the main character as Tarzan. He's John, John Greystoke, a former ape man that has returned to the land of his forefathers and become civilized. Which is precisely the problem. I'm not saying such a storyline couldn't work. The books themselves did it in The Son of Tarzan, and it worked very well. Rather the problem is that of tone.Let me explain. Tarzan as a character is a proto-superhero. His popularity paved way for the superheroes of the 20th century. And like those superheroes, he was essentially, at the core of his character, an ideal. A somewhat racially insensitive, overblown and colonially inspired ideal, but an ideal none the less. He was more than a mere man. In him intermixed myth, legend and the potential of mankind. Just like they do in modern comics and movies.Which is why it is so hard for me, as an avid Tarzan fan, to watch a movie where my beloved childhood icon loses most of his fights, barely survives in the jungle, is weak in spirit and in speech, shows disdain for Africa and overall resembles the original character only in the broadest strokes possible. And yes, I know that they were merely trying to make the character and the story more realistic and modernized in values. But this is Tarzan. It's like making a story about Zeus where the central conflict is Hera filing a divorce against him for cheating on her with multiple women, men and animals. It would be more realistic and modern, yes, but is that really what you would like to see.Aside from Tarzan the movie has its ups and downs. The cast is plenty strong with Christoph Waltz, Margot Robbie and even Samuel L. Jackson lending their talent. The CGI is okay, the costuming looks good and the aesthetics overall are pleasing. The ending is a bloated CGI mess. You know you probably should use a bit more money on effects when The Lion King did almost the exact scene more convincingly over two decades ago.The Legend of Tarzan failed to impress me. Its main character is horrible, its story is forgettable and overall it only has a few big name actors and some nice visuals to offer.",The Legend of Tarzan
53,lisafordeay,Good but not a classic,5,8 July 2016,"Yesterday I went to see the new Tarzan movie as I am a lover of Tarzan since I seen the 1999 classic Tarzan which was distributed by Disney. There has been a lot of Tarzan movies during the years from the Disney one,to George Of The Jungle even there was a film 3 years ago that literally bombed at the box office and now we have the David Yates from Harry Potter fame to direct this sequel from Warner Bros Pictures. The movie opens with a man called Leon Rom played by Christoph Waltz who has set up a scheme to destroy the jungle with his fellow men. Fast forward a few years later and a King called Leopold of Belgium is involved with the jungle scheme as well as Leon Rom and we meet a man called John Clayton III and his wife Jane Clayton(played by Alexander Skarssgard and Margo Robbie) who are living in the late 1800s in London England. Of course as you probably guessed already John Clayton III is actually Tarzan and he has forgotten who he is and himself and the wife,along with a man called George Washington(played by Samuel L Jackson)have no other choice but to go back to the Jungle so that Tarzan can save his mankind from the evil Leon Rom(Waltz),adding some series of flashbacks throughout ranging from Tarzan as a baby who was raised by a monkey to him meeting Jane Porter(nee Clayton)right to the present tense.So will Tarzan save his people and save the jungle?Overall this movie is packed with some very good special effects and the acting is actually fairly good. Alexander was great as Tarzan he was great during the climax scene and Margo was great as Jane who was later kidnapped by Christoph's character. Now my main issue with this film is the story. It actually took me a very long time to get into this thing. Also its very serious and its very dark as there is A lot of violence involved. But still this is the sort of film where you just watch it once and then leave it after that. Also another thing that had me scratching my head for a bit was this King Leopold of Belgium charcther that we never get to see in this movie. I actually thought that Leopold was a Duke of Albany NOT a King from Belgium who died from some sort of disease in 1876? But hey that's just me I guess.Overall its a C+ and a 5/10 rating. Keep an eye out for Ben Chaplin who plays Ella's father in Cinderella(2015)as he is in it for a 10 minute cameo working for Christoph Waltz before he gets killed by the African men,and Jim Broadbent.",The Legend of Tarzan
54,subxerogravity,Wow! Was not expecting it to be so spectacular!!,7,1 July 2016,"Was not expecting it to be so good.I did go into it thinking I did not want to see a movie about a white dude becoming King of an African Jungle, and I think the filmmakers themselves tried to be favorable of that opinion. If you have any familiarity with Tarzan, especially movies that came before, this film acts as a continuation of that. It tells the origin of Tarzan, a boy lost in the jungle and raised by apes to become a ghost like figure, but this film more focus on the life after Tarzan left the jungle and joined civilization were his legend became the stories that Edgar Rice Burroughs wrote about.Samuel L Jackson plays a doctor who needs Tarzan's help when Tarzan gets an invitation to come back to the Congo, the doctor needs to come with him to find out if slavery is being practice there, but it turns out the invitation was a trap laid out by the the villain, Rom, played by the brilliant Christoph Waltz in his element, to deliver Tarzan to an old enemy, also played brilliantly Djimon Hounsou.Jackson's role in this keeps it from being some white dude who saves Africa from other white dudes. This is one of his better supporting roles as he was funny and dramatic when needed. The chemistry between Jackson and Alexander Skarsgård works like a charm. I love Djimon Hounson character as an African Chief seeking vengeance with Tarzan's death. It was very Black Panther like (or more like Black Cheetah, as the costume design shows).I like Margot Robbie as Jane as well. At first it seem they tried too hard to to make Jane not just the chick Tarzan saved, but as the movie went on and her character developed , she went on a small adventure herself that was as exciting as Tarzan.It's an action packed adventure through the Congo. The visual effects worked to make the terrain beautiful and dangerous and epic. It's also fun an exciting, it will have you laughing throughout all the action.It still floors me how fantastic this thing turned out. Worth seeing",The Legend of Tarzan
55,RodrigAndrisan,Special effects killed that Johnny star,2,18 July 2016,"That star Johnny being my countryman Johnny Weissmuller, born in Timisoara, Romania, the leading character in ""Tarzan the Ape Man""(1932), ""Tarzan and His Mate""(1934), ""Tarzan Escapes""(1936), ""Tarzan Finds a Son!""(1939), ""Tarzan's Secret Treasure""(1941), ""Tarzan's New York Adventure""(1942), ""Tarzan Triumphs""(1943), ""Tarzan's Desert Mystery""(1943), ""Tarzan and the Amazons""(1945), ""Tarzan and the Leopard Woman""(1946), ""Tarzan and the Huntress""(1947), ""Tarzan and the Mermaids""(1948), THAT'S THE REAL TARZAN, not this no salt and no pepper Alexander Skarsgård. The whole film is vapid, flavorless and inane. Mr.Christoph Waltz as Leon Rom, does not prove being a major actor in this role, anyone could have been in his place. Mr. Samuel L. Jackson is the same in all the movies, eating the bread to thousands of other players definitely more talented than him(I had enough to see him in almost all the movies). Even ""Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes""(1984), directed by Hugh Hudson with Christopher Lambert and Andie MacDowell is much better. And because it is about writing reviews here, somebody from IMDb or other serious writers of reviews, nobody doesn't notices and to tell to those who do nothing than to narrate the film, that doesn't mean writing a review ???????",The Legend of Tarzan
56,DarkVulcan29,Enjoyable for the most part,7,5 July 2016,"I've never read the original Tarzan books, and I'm not sure how close to the character in the books this movie, I've watched the one with Christopher Lambert, and I really liked it. What to say about this version, it never tries to be annoyingly over the top like The Lone Ranger(2013). It starts out a little slow, but does pick up has it goes along.Alexander Skarsgard does okay with what he is giving, looks less like Tarzan, instead looking more like he should be playing He-Man. There are spots they make Tarzan come across like a superhero, now I'm willing to suspend a serious of disbelief, but that is just pushing it a bit. Samuel L. Jackson does bring charisma to his part, if not it would have been boring. Christoph Waltz is alright, but I was expecting more menacing like he known for playing, but still not terrible. Margot Robbie is pretty memorable has Jane, not playing her helpless, but tough and fearless. Action scenes are pretty good, there overuse of CGI. But still an enjoyable film to pass the time.",The Legend of Tarzan
57,stevendbeard,Very Good Reboot,8,1 July 2016,"I saw ""The Legend of Tarzan"", starring Alexander Skarsgard-True Blood_tv, Straw Dogs_2011; Samuel L. Jackson-The Hateful Eight, Jumper; Margot Robbie-Focus, Pan Am_tv, and she is going to play Harley Quinn in the up-coming Suicide Squad; Christoph Waltz-Spectre, The Three Musketeers_2011 and Djimon Hounsou-Guardians of the Galaxy, Amistad.This is a reboot of the Tarzan movies and a very good one, too. It's directed by David Yates, who directed several of the Harry Potter movies. Although the Edgar Rice Burroughs created hero, Tarzan, has been around for a while and had lots of adaptations made over the years-I fondly remember watching the Johnny Weissmuller ones as a kid-this one is based on the Dark Horse comic book version. Alexander takes on the iconic role of Tarzan and Margot is his Jane. The story starts as Alexander is an adult, living in London as the sophisticated Lord Greystroke, and not Tarzan, the man raised by apes in the jungle. Alexander is called upon by Samuel, who knows all about his past life in the Congo jungles as Tarzan, and needs his help on a situation, involving Christoph, the villain, just trying to make a buck, as villains do from time to time. Djimon plays an African chieftain that wants Alexander's head on the end of his spear for killing his son. Of course, the chief's son had just killed Alexander's ape friend so Alex just had to do what he does best, open a can of jungle justice on the son. During flashbacks, you learn how Alexander became Tarzan. If you are a Tarzan fan, rest easy. Alexander swings through the trees, fights apes-and assorted natives & other humans-and does the Tarzan yell, although it is similar to the original one, it is slightly different. Oh yeah, when he is in the jungle, he wears pants-no shirt of course- instead of the traditional loincloth. If that is not a deal breaker, then you should enjoy this movie. I did. FYI: The name Tarzan means 'White Ape', since he was raised by apes. It's rated ""PG-13"" for action, violence, sexual content-including brief nudity-and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes. I really liked it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",The Legend of Tarzan
58,drqshadow-reviews,"A Big-Budget, But Generic, Vine-Swinging Adventure",4,21 November 2016,"Peer at the lead character's name and a list of participating actors; it's basically just a game of connect the dots from there. Tarzan grows up amidst gorillas and swings on vines. Mean people shoot said gorillas, enslave natives and abduct Jane. Christoph Waltz is a posh, narcissistic, delicate-but-lethal villain. Samuel L. Jackson is persistently incredulous as he shouts lines of comic relief. Many strapping, bare-chested men decorate the fringes of the screen. Bellows are howled, trees are climbed, fires are set, vengeance is exacted, crocodiles are fed. Its most interesting scraps - Tarzan's means of communication with animals and his adult life as a reformed London citizen - are either forgotten until it's convenient for the plot or discarded completely. Watchable but bland, The Legend of Tarzan goes through the required motions but lacks much in the way of spirit or innovation. Fine as popcorn fodder or something to blare while you're busy in the other room, but unworthy of undivided attention.",The Legend of Tarzan
59,alindsay-al,An above average entertaining film,6,12 July 2016,"I did have some excitement for this film and I have now seen the legend of Tarzan and it is an alright film. The premise sees a now civilised Tarzan have to return to the jungle to stop a mercenary from enslaving and destroying the jungle. Alexander skarrsgard plays Tarzan and I thought he did a decent job. Physically he looked perfect for the character and I thought he did a decent job with the complexity of the lord of the jungle. However, I didn't feel any fun involving the character and a bit of a lack of charisma from the character. Margot Robbie plays Jane and she does a good job in being more then just a simple damsel in distress and being a tough woman who you believe Tarzan would be attracted to. Samuel l Jackson is fantastic in this film as Tarzan's American friend and he really brings some life into this film with his usual charisma. Christoph waltz plays the villain in the film and he is his usual self and he is good in his role and adds to the film. The story of the film is pretty paper thin and feels like an excuse to show the beautiful African jungles. But I really liked the flashbacks showing how Tarzan grew up in the jungle and how he met Jane. I kind of wish a film in this style was the film we had got instead of a rushed story that feels forced. The script has some decent dramatic dialogue in it, its just the film lacked humour when needed in a Tarzan film. The style has some good cgi in it especially with the animals in the jungle. However, the fight scenes were hard to follow and were just a bit pointless to watch. Overall this is a decent Tarzan film but I hope they eventually make a better Tarzan film.",The Legend of Tarzan
60,Fluke_Skywalker,Bored of the jungle,6,4 October 2016,"Plot; John Clayton, the Earl of Greystoke, returns to Africa where he's known by another name. Tarzan.The Legend of Tarzan somehow managed to become this Summer's $180 million underdog, overcoming dire forecasts and weak reviews, it opened above estimates and showed relatively strong legs, ultimately grossing $356 million globally. Enough to make a profit? Perhaps not given its bloated budget, but far from the disaster it was forecast to be. But what about the movie itself? Well...Filled with some rather awful CGI and playing at times as if it were edited with a weed whacker, The Legend of Tarzan still manages to work--more or less--as a B-level popcorn movie, which is all it ever seems to be striving to be. The plot is bare bones and straight forward, feeling very thin, even for the genre, and it plays as if a lot of extra plot and subplots were left on the cutting room floor. The cast is a good one on paper, but Margot Robbie's Jane is a non entity, and seemingly sensing this, she's flat-out awful here. The normally colorful Christoph Waltz plays his villain very vanilla, and while Alexander Skarsgård looks the part, he's got the charisma of a banana peel. The best character and performance is Sam Jackson's George Washington Williams. Jackson blends fun and pathos in just the right amounts and lifts the movie whenever he's on screen.Never reaching the swashbuckling heights of genre brethren like The Mask of Zorro (1998) or the goofy fun of The Mummy (1999), The Legend of Tarzan nevertheless makes for a moderately diverting and utterly disposable bit of cheesy popcorn. -",The Legend of Tarzan

The CGI is excellent, allowing Tarzan to finally move through the jungle, hang with his animal friends and rescue Jane the way I'd imagined he would.I liked the origin story and darker themes explored in this version.

62,drystyx,Good mood makes up for most of the weakness,6,14 November 2016,"I expected to see Tarzan from the beginning, with the plane crash and all, but the fact that this story takes Tarzan from much later in life isn't a problem.It does denote the lack of thrills, however.The ""ape man"" raised by animals, does show a good rapport and communication with Nature.And the mood of the film is pretty good.Trouble is, we have no idea what in the world we are watching.I had never heard of any of these unknown actors, save for the guy from Jurassic Park who held on to his butt, but my friend said they were famous. Well, I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt as a cast of unknowns, because otherwise it's a huge waste of big names.In fact, the Sam Jackson guy is the ONLY actor that can enunciate in this film. Don't bother trying to figure out what any of the others are saying. They fail miserably at Speech. I'd rather have close caption for the actors speaking English than for the ones speaking other languages. We might have some idea what is going on.Not being able to understand a word is okay, if we aren't meant to, but I think we're supposed to. A deluxe failure.However, I followed the mood of the story, and it was regular ""up against a mean machine"" type mood. The stunts looked goofy enough to please the geeks, and not too many of them to annoy those of us who aren't on drugs.The cinema was very bland for a jungle. I almost fell asleep between the bland scenery and the inability of the actors and actresses to utter more than 25% of intelligible dialog.While it is a ""poor"" movie in terms of directing, cinematography, scenery, and technical aspects, it has an uplifting quality to it, and doesn't leave you feeling depressed.

63,peterp-450-298716,"Great legend, average movie.",5,11 October 2016,"""Bring it to me. Bring him to me. And you shall have your diamonds.""Once and a while my mother allowed me to choose a comic strip at the store when I was a small boy. I always opted for a Tarzan comic strip. It appealed very strongly to my imagination at that time. That ruler of the jungle who used lianas to travel and who ruled over those wild fellow residents of the jungle. Even films from the old days with Johnny Weissmuller captivated me. Weissmuller was more impressive compared to this Tarzan. I'm talking about the size of his thorax and those developed biceps and triceps. Tarzan in this movie is a tad less muscled and he's already adapted to modern society. No ""Me Tarzan.You Jane"" conversations. He rather listens to the name John Clayton (Alexander Skarsgård). A distinguished English gentleman who walks around gallantly on two legs and speaks eloquently to his fellow men. He's civilized, in other words.And then there's Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) who explores Africa while looking for valuable diamonds to fund the expansionism of the Belgian King Leopold II. Rom is a determined globetrotter who won't let anything stand in his way so he can reach his goal. There's one obstacle between him and the valuable diamonds. And that's Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou) who only wants one thing in exchange for those precious diamonds. And that's Tarzan. Time for Rom to forge a plan and lure the lord of the jungle in a clever way to the dark African continent. The jeering jungle dweller is being accompanied by his lovely wife Jane (Margot ""Focus"" Robbie). Something else to be worried about.Is ""The Legend of Tarzan"" a bad movie? No, not really. But it isn't an excellent movie either. It sometimes looks a little bit out dated. Even though Tarzan is placed in a totally different zeitgeist and his attitude towards the natives in Africa isn't so explicitly authoritarian anymore. Even Jane isn't such a sensitive screaming blonde in distress, who runs out of the jungle the moment a tiny wild animal shows itself. Ultimately, the film unfolds itself like a typical Tarzan story in which the terror of the jungle has to rescue his wife out of the hands of the bad guys. That's how it also was portrayed in comics and the older movies. Lets say, it's not such a legendary movie.Admit it. Tarzan doesn't look like he could withstand the primal force of the Mangani and actually he should have ended up as a comfy carpet in some hut in the bush after receiving such hammer blows of this fearsome attacker. But I could live with that. After all, he's a legend. This film is about THE legend. An unassailable and invincible superhero whose status reached iconic proportions. Clearly noticeable was the unconvincing look of the group of gorillas. Compared to ""The Jungle Book"", the CGI of the wild animals sometimes really looked miserable. Then again, the flock of ostriches advancing in a ""Jurassic Park"" kind of way, were beautifully designed. The thing that went over my head (probably because I'm thinking with a rational mind), was the way they were chasing the speeding train. The way those lianas made sure they caught up with it, was mind blowing. What ingenious system was constructed to achieve this? I couldn't figure it out immediately. But it still looked really ridiculous.""The Legend of Tarzan"" is suitable material for a cozy movie night . There's sufficient action to enjoy. And Samuel L. Jackson has been recruited to provide the comic relief. Margot Robbie looks breathtaking again as the ""lady in distress."" And the confrontation between Tarzan and the tribe of Mbonga was brilliant until the digitized gorillas appeared on screen. The easiest part was played by Christoph Waltz. He just had to play himself again. A great actor, but he's stuck in the same routine lately. Despite everything, Tarzan was,is and remains a vibrant legend.More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT",The Legend of Tarzan
64,adamjohns-42575,Ahhhahhhhahhhhahhhahhh!,3,1 July 2020,"I did not really like this one, I felt that the story had been too Hollywood-ised. I know that's not a real word, but you know what I mean, too many silly jokes, usually from Samuel. L (Although it was nice to see him playing something at least slightly different for a change) and too many big explosions and bad guys, not to mention Tarzan suddenly being a superbeing just because he grew up in the jungle.
I think I prefer Christipher Lamberts Greystoke, although gritty and a lot simpler, I feel it tells the story I expect of Tarzan. Perhaps I should watch the Disney version and see how that one goes? This one just seemed to be out to make a blockbuster and actually didn't really even achieve that.
As much as I love Mr Skarsgard (He was brilliant in True Blood) I don't think he was hired for this film because he could play the part well, but more for his stature and fantastic physique, which honestly even I grew tired of as he just didn't fit for me.
There are times also, where I felt that it was more like Mowgli's return to the jungle as he spoke to the animals to get them on side and do his bidding. Perhaps I'm missing a key part of the original story by Burroughs, but it was all very geared to his success from the beginning, there was no adversity to overcome with any great struggle. And yes I know that this is a revisit, but it's ten years later, very convenient that the same animals are still living and still don't want to eat him, don't you think?Another thing that I don't like in these overly CGI'd animal films is that they never seem to get the Gorillas right, which apparently is explained away by them being a different breed known as Mangani's or something?

Gorillas get a bad rap, yet again, and for that reason this movie will eventually be superseded by another interpretation that doesn't do that. It wasn't necessary. The excellent cgi could have been devoted to more dangers from big cats or hyenas for example. I loved the warriors for Africa in this, which dovetailed with brilliant locations and effective framing, and great action scenes. There are some brilliant ideas here, much in the same way that the recent Disney Jungle Book was a brilliant adaption. The elephants play almost the same role. Attention has been given so as to not knock the audience too far off the believability shelf, and the Tarzan character is probably the best one since Ron Ely.

Tarzan is established and we get just enough of an origin story, without being bored to death. The acting in the film is solid all around.

68,jadepietro,Going Ape,7,30 June 2016,"(RATING: ☆☆☆½ out of 5) THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. IN BRIEF: A conventional approach to the Tarzan story which swings back and forth, without getting anywhere. GRADE: B-SYNOPSIS: The story of a little boy who goes ape.JIM'S REVIEW: There have been many incarnations of the Tarzan legend, starting with Edgar Rice Burroughs original 1914 novel, Tarzan of the Apes. Our ape man has appeared in magazines, novels, comic books, movies, radio, cartoons, and television shows, all with varying degrees of success. Various actors have filled his loincloth, from the most famous actor in this role, Johnny Weissmuller in the 1940's, to Gordon Scott in the 1950's and Ron Ely taking hold of those vine reins in the mid 60's. His legend lives on once again in this modern day re-boot, The Legend of Tarzan, with Alexander Skarsgård as our muscle-toned hero. The story adheres to its source and follows the basic outline of Burrough's novel. Told in flashbacks, we learn of an infant left in the jungle without parents and adopted by the great apes. Tarzan, now John Clayton III, Lord Greystoke, lived and thrives in his tropical environs until he was rescued and returned to England. Having difficulty readjusting to British society, he finds a comrade in the beautiful Jane Porter (a beguiling Margot Robbie). Upon his return to his childhood home in the Congo, Greystoke (a.k.a. Tarzan) discovers man's cruelty in the form of Belgian huntsman, Leon Rom (a typecast Christoph Waltz, playing, what else, but the villain). Whereupon Tarzan must takes sides to protect his adopted tribe of primates and protect his homeland.Mr. Skarsgård plays Tarzan as an eloquent victim, more at home with his hairy friends than his human species. No ""Me Tarzan, you Jane"" monosyllabic banter here, and no loincloth either. This Tarzan mixes the physicality and brutishness of Stanley Kowalski with the sophistication and aplomb of a true noble gentleman, no small feat. If only the film matched his interpretation also.The Legend of Tarzan is all too proper and seriously-minded which cuts down on the fun and adventure. David Yates directs his film solidly, keeping the action moving. Yet the production design by Stuart Craig seems too well-crafted for its own good, nothing out of place. It lacks authenticity in its detailing. This man-made jungle is just too pristine, so clean and sanitized just like its story. (When the vines look suspiciously like greenish rubber tubes and the cragged rocks like painted styrofoam, something is a bit off.) The special effects aren't that special either. Except for the primates, most of the animal kingdom is obviously the results of CGI, effective but slightly unreal and unsatisfying.On the plus side, the fluid camera-work by Henry Braham has an acrobatic energy, especially as Tarzan travels from vine to vine, the best part of the cinematic experience. Mark Day's fine editing enhances the effect. The panoramic vistas help to give the film a sense of epic adventure, even if the adventures we witness never attain the grandeur of other epic film tales due to its script.The narrative structure swings from its more interesting backstories (Tarzan's early life and upbringing, his adaptation to his aristocratic England, Jane's personal journey) which are only hinted, to the standard main story dealing with The Great White Hunter's poaching of ivory, diamonds, and the slave trade...granted all important subjects, but the treatment is painted in the most black and white terms with the widest of brushstrokes. That's the problem...there are no grey stokes in this Greystoke's version.None of the characters are remotely real or believable, but the roles are well cast. There is a nice chemistry between the two leads, although their beauty reminds us too often of an Abercrombie and Fitch ad. Both are gorgeous human specimens who fortunately can act, even if the dialog that they are given by screenwriters Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer, is banal and stilted.Given strong support is Samuel L. Jackson as the real life George Washington Williams, a political activist and do-gooder, but his character, as written, speaks in anachronistic modern day jargon. Still the actor brings much needed bravado and is amusing in his role. Djimon Hounsou as the avenging chief does some effective underplaying when Mr. Waltz again overplays the menace angle. However he does bring some interesting human quirks to the part. (Nice moment with the silverware arrangement, Christoph.)All in all, the initial story line remains intriguing, the action sequences entertain, and Mr. S. makes an awesome impression, all swagger, six-pack, and sensitivity in a tight delightful manly package, although his fluent English language skills are never addressed.This Tarzan has its flaws, but it does keep the legend intact, until the next chapter.Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.comANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com",The Legend of Tarzan
69,richard-1787,Waaaaaaaaay too long,4,1 July 2016,"This movie, though it runs only 109 minutes, seemed waaaaaaaaay too long when I sat through it today. It is just one episode after the next, all of them predictable: there will be an incredible fight scene, but the good guys will always emerge untouched - except when Tarzan fights a gorilla, in which case he does get bitten. There is no narrative arc, no sense of building to a climax, though there is a climax when we suddenly find ourselves in Boma.Some of the views of the African forest are very beautiful. The gorilla animation seems lifelike at times, at other times not at all, like the recent Jungle Book. (This is not as good as that.) The leading lady is beautiful to look at, and has some expression. The man who plays Tarzan/Lord Greystoke does not act, and is usually expressionless. This is a real problem, because the only way this movie makes any sense is as a comedy. Samuel L. Jackson gets some good comic lines, which he knows how to deliver, but Tarzan is always very serious, and with this material that gets boring very quickly.The last scene, where Boma gets overrun by animals, is clever until the very end, when the ship blows up but Tarzan emerges unscathed.And did you know that no one - and I mean no one - ever sweats in the Congo? No one, at least not in this movie. Which is strange among other reasons because all Lord Greystoke can say about the Congo in the first part of the movie is that it is very hot.Did you know, also, that there were modern fitness gyms in the Congo forests? We don't get to see them, but the young Congolese warriors all have torsos that only come out of gyms. They are well fed muscle boys.I could go on pointing out what makes this movie unintentionally funny, but you get the point.My last big objection, and it is a serious one, is that the movie gives you the impression that the Africans win this battle with the Europeans. Far from it. The Belgian Congo was different from most African colonies in that it was not a national colony, one that belonged to a country, but rather one that belonged to an individual, King Leopold of Belgium. It was his to exploit as he chose, and exploit it he did, in terrible ways. Belgium did not take control of it, and reduce the horrors, until 1908. But it remained a European colony until 1960. The end of the movie gives you the impression that Leopold has lost and the Congolese are now free. Far from it.If you are looking for incredible fight scenes, go watch Star Wars or something like that. If you want to watch bare muscular torsos, go watch professional wresting, or the old Johnny Weismuller Tarzan movies, or something on the internet.If you want to feel trapped in a movie theater on a nice summer day, wishing you could get back out in nature, go see this movie.",The Legend of Tarzan
70,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Legend of Tarzan,5,5 July 2016,"I'm not an expert on the story of Tarzan, but here's what I picked up from a midday screening of 2016's latest re-imagining: John Clayton III (that's the actual name of the main character) grew up in Gabon, a country in Equatorial Africa. After his father died, he was raised by Apes, learned to swing on vines, be one with all sorts of animals, and befriend his true love, Jane Porter. Now as he lives a quiet life in London, he is summoned back to his homeland by a former American Civil War soldier. The mission: To investigate the interests of a mining camp in the Congo. Oh and did I mention there's some evil dude out there doing a little diamond smuggling as well?Bottom line: The Legend of Tarzan is a passable yet unmemorable viewing experience. Call it a second-tier Raiders of the Lost Ark manufactured for the Disney age. Here's what you get acting-wise: Christoph Waltz gives us his standard, antagonistic performance (with strangling wrist beads as a wubby). Lead Alexander Skarsgard looks like a young Viggo Mortensen but lacks any real charisma. Samuel L. Jackson being Samuel L. Jackson, provides satire as a goofy sidekick with a gun. Finally, romantic interest Margot Robbie continues to disappoint after being so brilliant in The Wolf of Wall Street (her Jane narrates poorly and sort of thinks she's in a comedy). Yeah it's all packaged in 2016's gaudiest summer epic.Now from what I've gathered, ""Legend"" is far more symbolic and dramatically inclined than 1981's Tarzan, the Ape Man. It's also probably more modernized and digitally enhanced than Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes. Don't be fooled though. At just under two hours, this is a loud movie that is full of dangled, random flashbacks that almost deflate any perceptible momentum (Tarzan losing his daddy because Apes beat him to death, Tarzan learning to speak and communicate, Tarzan meeting Jane for the first time, etc.). Director David Yates who was in charge of the later Harry Potter flicks, employs a large canvas with his camera moving fast and forthright. To go along with Henry Braham's lush cinematography, he adds lots of extras in every frame, riverboat scenes that would make Francis Ford Coppola jealous, images of CGI wildlife that bring forth a Noah's Ark-like vision, and pedestrian action sequences that have some unnecessary slow motion to boot (John Clayton fights slave drivers, tribesmen, and just about everybody else here).Overall, this is a great looking film that was obviously designed for the big screen and/or widescreen. However, it has a handsome yet muted Tarzan that is difficult to root for. Just because the musical score pounces in every time he's about to dispose of cardboard villains, doesn't mean his actions are worth memorializing. The same notions apply when he's about to kiss the girl, about to beat his chest with an infamous mating call, and about to become the hero. Rating: 2 stars.",The Legend of Tarzan
71,rannynm,Quite disappointing,4,5 July 2016,"Alas, Tarzan lovers rise to the continuation of this legendary story, but take a seat because this film is disappointing. The film covers Tarzan's life after he left Africa to live in England as John Clayton and returns to Africa to help his country. After a series of dangerous obstacles and captures, Tarzan fights to save his love Jane. I found the film's plot so confusing and disconnected that it was difficult to give a thorough summary without looking it up. The film stars Alexander Skarsgard as Tarzan who, in the movie, is quite civilized, British and sophisticated despite the fact that he was raised by gorillas in the jungle. This disappointed me because it is one thing to make a bad movie but it's even more disappointing when the film has a template to follow and doesn't. In the original film, Jane is British but in this adaptation she is American. This really confused me because of its inconsistency with the original story. Another disappointing aspect is that the apes in this film were not his friends. They were his enemies. The back story of Tarzan is all about how he was raised by gorillas and how they are his family. I did not enjoy seeing Tarzan fighting the creatures that are supposed to be his family. Looking past that inconsistency and hard-to-follow plot, on the positive side, the film has impressive visuals that make it quite entertaining. The characters are not ones you get attached to or gain a bond with and, me for that makes the movie lack the emotional connection it needs to really draw in the audience.I feel as if the film doesn't focus on appropriate things. It focuses a lot on business schemes to get money rather than the emotional struggles and journeys in the jungle. The film has little details and aspects that are alright, such as the casting, but I just did not find the movie compelling. I think it would interest people that like historical fiction and recommend it for tweens and teens. People between the ages of 30 to 60 would also enjoy it because of its complexity and historical background. I would not go out of my way to see this and rank it 2 out of 5 stars because I was so disappointed in it. Reviewed by Harmony M., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.",The Legend of Tarzan
72,Kingslaay,Forgettable and passable,6,12 May 2017,I had high hopes for this film when I went to watch it but was sadly disappointed. The story was poorly done and not executed well. It was a unique spin on Tarzan but poorly dramatized. The main cast were also a let down. Hollywood seem to have a fascination with Margot Robbie but she is not as exceptional or good as people make her out to be. Her films continue to be bad performers. This film is forgettable and no loss if you miss it.,The Legend of Tarzan
73,Rob_Taylor,An over-reliance on CGI lets the movie down,6,3 August 2016,"It's not a bad film, but neither is it a cinematic masterpiece. Not that I was expecting such, but I had hopes for this version that were sadly lacking. Let me explain...Tarzan, for me at least, is one of those iconic heroes that I grew up with as a kid thanks to Johnny Weismuller. Whilst the movies back then did not have the benefit of modern computer graphics and such, they still managed to tell a stirring adventure tale within their limits. Note... The key word here is ""stirring"".Legend of Tarzan, by comparison, is just a bit... dull, really. It tells an adventure tale that is in line with the Tarzan tales of old, yet fails to make it exciting.A big part of the problem is the overuse of CGI. There is a lot of it here... backgrounds, animals, cities etc. So much that isn't real that you have to wonder why they bothered making a live-action movie at all.What is worse, in plenty of instances, the CGI is bad. Not terrible, but just obviously CGI. And I don't mean in a ""Oh, that can't be a real gorilla. because it would be too dangerous to film, so it must be CGI"" way either. The CGI in some instances is a terrible and obvious distraction.The most egregious example is with the swinging on vines scenes. I swear they must have gotten the same people to do the CGI there that worked on Van Helsing. In one scene, Tarzan and his buddies swing down on vines onto a moving train. The problem is that the train is moving away from them, yet the obvious attachment point of the vines seems also to be moving with it. In short, it looks bloody awful and fake as hell.As far as the acting goes, no one stinks, but it is an exercise in excesses, for the most part. Tarzan is understated, which is no bad thing, but Christopher Waltz's villain Leon Rom is a one-note cardboard cut-out that is as threatening as a fine drizzle.Also, the movie accepts that Tarzan exists and that everyone knows his origin story. The result is a film that starts off with Tarzan living in London with Jane. Flashbacks reveal some of the origins of Tarzan, but it is very much an afterthought. Whilst I might normally applaud this and hope that other well-known stories take note of this approach (cough...Batman...cough...Spiderman....cough) I can't help feeling that this makes the beginning of the movie a little awkward and disjointed. Have you ever turned on a film half-way through and had to figure out what was going on? This gives you a similar feeling... as if you've missed part of the story.As for the story... Well it is workmanlike, I guess. As I mentioned above, the excess of CGI lessens the impact the film might have otherwise had if those excesses had been curbed. But hey! We live in an age where anything can be shown on film. It is just a shame that film-makers don't understand the concept of ""Less is more."" Speaking of which... There are a few scenes which serve little purpose other than to bloat the run-time and drag out proceedings. A sharper editing knife could have trimmed a good fifteen minutes off this movie and turned it into what it really should have been - a TV movie. As it is, these extra scenes (often filled with pointless dialogue) are almost as big a distraction as the excessive CGI.All in all, Legend of Tarzan is an okay watch. I doubt you'll be wanting to go back for seconds and I sincerely hope this doesn't generate any sequels, because with this mindset towards the character and film-making techniques, it will only do the IP harm in the long run.SUMMARY: Tolerable but weighed down by too much CGI. Weak dialogue and editing and a rather dull tone to the whole thing make the viewing a little tedious. Not one you'll watch twice.",The Legend of Tarzan
74,pc95,A Big Expensive Mess,4,11 November 2016,"Director David Yates ambitious, ridiculous, loud, and expensive ""Legend of Tarzan"" is a big dud. Although there are certainly worse movies come around, this steamer tries unsuccessfully to imagine a successor story to the original that manages to be a bore for more than half its runtime, and include some bits of preposterous Superhuman Terminator-type action towards the end that becomes utter non-sense. Thrown in are his additional powers as lord of the jungle bits where he has dominion of many species in the jungle. The story is everywhere in a bad way. Yates seems to be trying to throw together 2 or 3 story lines into 1 hr and 45 min runtime - is the movie about the life of Tarzan, or Slave Trade, or his history - who knows?

76,bkrauser-81-311064,A Cardboard Placeholder,6,28 June 2016,"Tarzan, for better or worse has been around in one form or another since 1912. If one's counting, Alexander Skarsgard is the 20th actor to bring the loincloth donning Ape Man to the big screen; a list that includes everyone from the instantly memorable Johnny Weissmuller to the embarrassingly campy Casper Van Dien. The initial appeal of Tarzan stems from author Edgar Rice Burrough's ability to gauge his audience. Broad and formulaic, the tales of Tarzan fed into the eternal mystery of Africa that galvanized readers who saw the dark continent as the last frontier. Burrough's book series fits comfortably amid Haggard's ""King Solomon's Mines"" and Kipling's ""The White Man's Burden"" as a piece of fiction that seems at times excruciatingly antiquated.Yet the legend endures as each generation adds its own little spin. The Weissmuller films brought nuclear family normalcy to the jungle; Christopher Lambert injected 1980's machismo; Van Dien was 90's environmentalism and now we have the aught 10's and our obsession with franchises that implant post-modern wink-winks. The Legend of Tarzan is a soft reboot with an emphasis on the word soft. The film begins with our villain Leon Rom (Waltz) making a deal with the menacing Chief Mbonga (Hounsou). Mbonga promises Rom a pile of diamonds in exchange for bringing Tarzan back from England so he may personally slay him for a slight done years ago. Rom hopes to use the diamonds to fund an army of mercenaries hired on behalf of the Belgian crown. Then, after finishing the railroads through the jungle, Rom, with the full support of Belgium will personally bring the Congo aka the heart of Africa to its knees. Meanwhile back in England, John aka Tarzan (Skarsgard) has fully adjusted to life in Britain and refuses to return to Africa ""because it's hot."" He's convinced to return only after American emissary George Washington Williams (Jackson) announces his suspicion that the Belgian crown is up to no good. Also Jane (Robbie) comes.The main issue with The Legend of Tarzan is it's trying to create a franchise from the middle out. It stretches its story from all sides, trying to cover new ground and generate new themes; basically announcing to the audience that this isn't the Tarzan you've seen in the past. Problem is, the film doesn't seem to have faith in its audience so it rehashes the origin story anyway. The film then hedges its bets further by dedicating time and an arc to Samuel L. Jackson's character, insuring we have an audience conduit to have story elements explained to. He gets a few deserved laughs for voicing shock and wonderment but his involvement just seems like a distraction to the main impetus of the story.And despite all the film's bells, whistles and clunky special- effects, the impetus is still Tarzan saving Jane. The supposed characterization of Jane (told in flashback of course) is done with such triteness that it conjures memories of Audrey Hepburn in Green Mansions (1959); and not in a good way. The film can make light of the fact that Margot Robbie is the damsel in distress all it wants but that doesn't excuse the fact that her only function in the film is to be a reward for Tarzan and be leered at by Rom.Christoph Waltz, for his efforts does a fine job as the villain doing his best to channel the subtle mannerisms and intense mania of Klaus Kinski. Yet the film's wanting script pigeonholes him as a snake; a menace really only good for a few quick and venomous attacks before he slithers away. He surreptitiously tinkers with a rosary made of Madagascar spider silk which not only serves as his weapon of choice but sends a loud message that Rom is a big proponent of Europe's three C's to justify subjugation: Colonize, Culture and Christianize. It's this that saves The Legend of Tarzan from being a complete waste of time. The very true and very vile atrocities committed in the Congo during the period of Belgian colonization is not only present but is given a real (if repetitious) heft. Even if the reasons for incorporating such mass enslavement, injustice and cultural genocide is to halfheartedly appeal to a wider international audience, I applaud Warner Bros. efforts.Yet given the, let's say malleability of the Tarzan ethos, there should have been much more to The Legend of Tarzan. As it is, the film is a cardboard placeholder for Warner Bros. to hold on to the live-action film rights of the Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc. property. The action is generic, the story is almost insultingly pedestrian and the faith the film has in its audience is dismaying. Do yourself a favor if you're really Jonesing for your fix of the Ape Man; go watch Disney's Tarzan (1999) again instead.",The Legend of Tarzan
77,moviexclusive,"Despite a promising first half, this contemporary re-imagining of Tarzan nevertheless falls short by choosing CG-enhanced spectacle over genuine character pathos",6,29 June 2016,"As enduring as he may have been through the history of cinema as well as in literature, Edgar Rice Burroughs' muscle-bound British lord raised by apes in the African jungle, who grows up to fall in love with an American woman named Jane, is undeniably antiquated in this day and age. Not only would its depiction of British colonialism and tribal Africans seem utterly archaic, the very fact that it conjures the notion of the white man's burden is cultural poison, which pretty much explains why the most successful take on the character in recent times has been the late-90s animation of the same name from Disney. And yet, for once and future 'Harry Potter' wizard David Yates to attempt his take on Tarzan inspires some measure of confidence that there remains a place for the Lord of the Apes in contemporary filmmaking.Sure enough, Yates and his screen writing duo of Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer start off well enough with a fresh narrative that begins with Tarzan as a now domesticated gentleman settled in his family's Greystoke Manor and happily married to his Jane. That period of domestic bliss is interrupted when he is summoned by the Prime Minister (Jim Broadbent) to accept an invitation by King Leopold of Belgium to revisit the Congo and serve as trade emissary for the British, an offer he refuses until the American statesman George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) persuades him to make the trip to investigate the latter's suspicions of slavery. Williams' character and motivations are no coincidence – his real-life namesake was a decorated Civil War soldier who had travelled to King Leopold's Congo Free State and written about the exploitation of the African people by the Belgian colony.That is but one adjustment that Yates makes to his tale in order to shake off the character's imperialistic shadow. Rather than have him lord over the local tribe he once spent time with, Yates positions Tarzan as their equal; later on, Tarzan will also come to acknowledge his dishonourable deed of having taken the life of a native from another tribe, which has in part contributed to his existing predicament. No sooner has he, Jane and Williams arrived in Africa does he find himself the target of a bunch of mercenaries led by King Leopold's representative Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz), who has made a deal with a vengeful tribal chief (Djimon Hounsou) in exchange for a fortune in legendary diamonds for his otherwise bankrupt sovereign.Tarzan narrowly escapes the kidnap, but Jane is not quite so lucky, and so the former spends the rest of his time reuniting with former friends and reconciliating with former foes while running and swinging through the dense African jungle in pursuit of the steamer on which Leon has Jane held captive. That setup is surprisingly engaging, though it does go back and forth a little too much to establish Tarzan's backstory from the source material (i.e. the death of his mother as an infant, his father's death at the hands of the leader of the ape tribe by whom he is adopted, and his first encounter with Jane where he saves her from the same ferocious ape leader); alas, even if it does get off to a good swing, this Tarzan ultimately falls off the vine when it is more than halfway through.We're not talking about Jackson's somewhat anachronistic sidekick act, which frankly we thought was a genuinely fun foil next to Tarzan's masculinity. We're not talking either about Waltz's umpteenth erudite villain act, which despite being niftily armed with deadly rosary made from Madagascar spider silk, is getting too familiar and tired. And certainly, we have no complaints about Margot Robbie's atypically feisty Jane, who brings nerve and bravado to her damsel-in-distress role. Oh no, what takes Tarzan down is how hasty he seems to get to his inevitable happy ending, so frenetic to the point that it trivialises his Alpha-male conflict with the ape leader whom he has a mano-a-mano with, the grudge that he was responsible for with Hounsou's Chief Mbonga, as well as the danger that he faces confronting Rom and his men out-numbered and out-gunned.That his Tarzan hardly registers isn't Alexander Skarsgård's fault though; in fact, the 'True Blood' hunk is probably one of the best, if not the best, Tarzan we have seen, not only in terms of his incredibly ripped physique but also of how he emotes his character's feral core in the earlier scenes. Yet Skarsgård is underserved by a mysterious urgency to get things over and done with – whether to ensure that the summer audience doesn't get bored or because Yates is too eager to move on to his next 'Harry Potter' venture – which only further leaves us in the cold as it rushes from one CG-enhanced setpiece to another. As well-filmed as these are – including an early one where Tarzan leads the natives to literally swing on board a moving train and the climactic centrepiece featuring a wildebeest stampede – they aren't quite as thrilling without a deeper emotional connection with the titular character himself.It is also somewhat unfortunate that 'The Legend of Tarzan' arrives in the wake of Disney's 'The Jungle Book', which represented the zenith of modern-day CG in portraying both the lush jungle environment as well as its inhabitants within. In comparison, the CG here comes off oddly alienating at best and subpar at worst, especially during the scenes where Tarzan is swinging through the trees at full speed. Yet what this rebooted tale of Tarzan really lacks is spirit and poignance, without which not even the character's famous jungle cry makes him resonate. Not all is lost of course, but given Yates' pedigree as well as a promising first half, we expect this Tarzan to come out swinging – rather than limping – to its finish.",The Legend of Tarzan
78,quincytheodore,"The new Tarzan looks good on paper or when he's standing still, but as it moves with shallow gimmicks and abundance of CG, it reverts back into bland predictable safari.",6,1 July 2016,"The story of Tarzan has been known for decades, the movie tries to capitalize this in expectation that audience will follow its two timelines and many branching subplots. Unfortunately, the admittedly nice view is encumbered by myriad of issues, contrasting tones and shallow social and political showing. It becomes an overly familiar sighting that barely presents the characters above their stereotypical roles.Tarzan or John (Alexander Skarsgård) returns to Africa after reclaiming his birthright, a conflicting homecoming as he deals with slavery and conspiracy. The story plays after the events of his origin, and the past is retold with several flashbacks. This different path is a welcomed change and surprisingly the little touch on these scenes are effective in setting his character. Alexander Skarsgård also looks the part for the brawny slightly beastly protagonist from his speech and mannerism.The problem is Tarzan and both his foes and allies are entirely predictable. Christoph Waltz as Leon Rom is almost identical to his other villain roles, down to the creepy table exchanges and only differs in attires. Margot Robbie is the new Jane, an attempt for more spunky and powerful female, but she's trapped in usual pretty damsel in distress role, which ironically the movie points out hoping for the opposite effect.Samuel L. Jackson performs as the sidekick William, also a vehicle for audience as he's new to the jungle. Expect the same charmingly brash Samuel here. Humor is relatively decent for light adventure, mainly In Samuel's expense, but the delivery is implemented in wrong way, thus it sometimes ruins the supposed intense atmosphere or just misses completely. It wants to have strong characters, social backdrop and occasional light comedy, although it throws them together, even in the same span of five minutes, more often than not it is not effective.For the exotic location, it does showcase some good cinematography. However, it doesn't take off as the focus on CG affects the authenticity. When the movie gives an organic camera angle or rapid motion, it eventually turns in CG fest. There's attempt to mask this with flash editing, not only that it doesn't work this rustic camera cut negates any impact on the action scene.A fairly nice trek muddled by disjointed narrative and clash in styles. With too much reliance in shallow gimmicks and abundance of CG, the beautiful scenery reverts back into bland predictable safari.",The Legend of Tarzan
79,Abdulxoxo,Quite enjoyable,6,15 February 2021,"Despite some minor flaws, I still found the film to be quite enjoyable. One of the flaws has to do with the editing; in one scene, within the space of a few seconds, Tarzan moved from beautiful sunshine to a dark rainy jungle. And Tarzan is swinging on a vine in between trees and over a pretty long distance. It was a little ridiculous how he managed to do that without switching to another vine. Another minor thing was all the CGI animals. They mostly looked good and some of the sequences with the humans and animals together were brilliant; but the CGI could have been better.There were many positives. The slavery element to the story provided an interesting (albeit controversial) perspective. The costume design, hair and make-up people, and all those involved in that area of the movie did a tremendous job. It was a beautifully made film. In particular I loved the look of tribe led by Chief Mbonga. They kind of resemble the Skull Island's native tribe in most 'King Kong' movies.The acting was good from the main cast. Skarsgard gets into shape for this part and despite some criticism I thought he played the part really well. Maggie Robbie was also good, in particular during her scenes with Waltz, who was himself excellent. He has a great way of playing these well spoken, well mannered, nuanced characters. Obviously Jackson is always good and without doubt he provided the best comedic line in the film.All in all, a fresh twist on the Tarzan story. The acting was really good. The CGI looked good. At the end of the day it's a fantasy adventure movie. You see these types of films for the same reason you see superhero films - the action and excitement. And it ticked most of the boxes.",The Legend of Tarzan
80,Screen_Blitz,"The Legend of Tarzan has the visuals and performances to please, but not the execution",6,18 November 2016,"In an era when Hollywood is almost constantly gnawing down on live-action adaptations of classic literature stories that we've seen Disney animation man times in the past (i.e The Jungle Book, Alice in Wonderland), it was only a matter of time before Edgar Rice Burroughs's classic jungle acrobat was met with an modern adaptation. Tarzan has made numerous appearances in cinema since the silent film era, with the arguably the most memorable being the Walt Disney animated picture back in 1999. This latest one directed by David Yates who flourish an amazing vision in the final four 'Harry Potter' movies uses our latest technology to boast amazing visuals to bring the spectacular world of Tarzan to life, but doesn't quite meet an exhilarating narrative heft or execution to make a memorable one. Set in the Victorian Era, the film stars Alexander Skarsgard as Tarzan who has married his love Jane (played by Margot Robbie) and has abandoned his life in the jungle to reside a more comfortable one in London under the name John Clayton. But upon visiting the congo after a long stay-away, Tarzan, Jane, and his friend George Washington Williams (played by Samuel L. Jackson) are suddenly ambushed by a violent army led by the corrupt Leon Rom (played by Christoph Waltz) who plans to enslave the congo, and Jane is kidnapped; Tarzan and Williams must band together to help not only save Jane, but also the life he once left behind.Unlike most live-action adaptations of classic stories Hollywood has tossed at us over the several years, this one was is handled not by Walt Disney Studios who brought us the spectacular 'Jungle Book' earlier this year, but by Warner Bros Studios. Though the absence of Disney is barely sensible, some may argue if the film could have been better handled by the Disney studios as it doesn't quite the fun nor the excitement Disney brought to The Jungle Book. Although the visuals such as the historical production design of Victorian era London and the use of CGI gorillas are enough to feast the eyes, the execution in which drives the film is not as fun as anticipated; especially for children expecting some musical numbers, talking gorillas, or even a soundtrack by Phil Collins. The film is driven a dark atmosphere dealing with historical themes such as colonialism and slavery, and the story is more often self-serious than exciting. The biggest excitement we get comes from the climatic action sequence towards the end during the stand-off between our titular hero and the main villain played by Christoph Waltz who gives a fine performance, but nothing memorable. Samuel L. Jackson who plays Tarzan's trusted sidekick offer some fair comic relief with his rather anachronistic one-liners, and Alexander Skarsgard himself does an okay job as our hero; but these two along with the attractive Margot Robbie bring some of the only saving grace that keeps this film from being a snooze. In the end, there is plenty to enjoy including some vine-swinging action by our titular character you'd come to expect but nothing truly spectacular.The Legend of Tarzan may not boast the best of Hollywood's treatment of classic children's tales, but to say the least it has the visuals and the performances by a talented cast to please. Yes, there is no doubt will exit this movie with disappointment but that is not to say that there isn't an redeeming value to the final product. It is entertaining at mostly surface level for those anticipating to see their favorite vine-swinging acrobat strike back.",The Legend of Tarzan
81,Troy_Campbell,Ruins the fun by going too dark.,4,9 July 2016,"Concocted over 100 years ago by Edgar Rice Burroughs, Tarzan has swung his way through countless stories not only in literature but also on radio, stage, television and film. So what fresh spin can this blockbuster add to such an oft-told tale? Well, none, it turns out. Firmly set in seriousville, this update anchors itself on a cliché-heavy and wearisome plot – with more holes and contrivances than a Fast and Furious movie – generating an overly solemn tone that saps every hint of fun out of the jungle adventure. Even the action sequences are predominantly devoid of excitement (a train brawl proving the exception); the choppy editing, shaky-cam cinematography and inconsistent CGI ruining the potentially thrilling animalistic fight choreography and uses of slow motion. As the titular ape-raised hero, Alexander Skarsgård brings the requisite physicality to his anger-driven protagonist, but lacks the levity and charm that would've made his Tarzan more likable and worth rooting for. Margot Robbie's Jane has pluck, wits and beauty, yet still requires saving repeatedly thanks to lazy plot devices, whilst Christoph Waltz brings his trademark eccentricity to enliven his villainous role. The less said about Samuel L. Jackson's completely unnecessary and woefully out of place sidekick the better. Despite possessing the tools required to reinvigorate this century-old yarn, The Legend of Tarzan squanders its opportunities with a pedestrian script, messy action and a needlessly dark mood.",The Legend of Tarzan
82,RNMorton,Edgar would approve,8,16 July 2016,"Excellent if slightly over-CGIed production on the most famous of the Edgar Rice Burroughs heroes. In this one Tarzan is not the mono-syllabic brute of the Weissmuller era but the same character as portrayed by Burroughs. And the story itself (absent the Samuel Jackson character) is something very much like what Burroughs would have done in one of his many Tarzan books. The actor playing Tarzan does a quiet if nice job, Robbie is a tad too model-ly for Jane but otherwise does well also. Jackson has been type-cast for some time now but his character was mildly appreciated. Everyone works pretty well together, the nobility of the Waziri warriors is played out very effectively. And Christoph Waltz plays the mannerly Satan better than anyone on the planet. Some parts move a little slowly but it works.

84,Richie-67-485852,More Tarzan Less Legend,6,22 July 2016,"I love Tarzan. What a great concept and story to tell and share. This latest version however is too modern, hip and leaves out the spirit of Tarzan or the core if you will. First off, going back to the jungle after so many years to me is waiting too long for a story to pick-up. Think habits and how we adapt from one thing to another. When one stops swinging around and spends more time sitting in meetings, that is their new life. Furthermore, I would have expected a stronger more meaty Tarzan as only the survival of the fittest can last and rule especially in the Jungle. For a guy who swings, runs, jumps, grabs and wrestles, you would expect a muscle group to reflect that. I see it as heavy upper build with big thighs myself. If he is imitating apes and how they live etc., then he would have their strength too yes? Hey, the law of the jungle prevails! Anything that can survive has to make a guaranteed first impression or they get eaten. No second chances. If he was Lord of the Apes, that didn't come through here via his strength but good looks? LOL Jane is too hip and masculine oh well. Starting with her, everything in this movie is presented as larger than life instead of just life. That's where it fails and one has to except the premise and memories of Tarzan instead of what is portrayed here to really enjoy the Tarzan tale. I have read the many tales of all the Tarzan adventures and they had detail, revelation and adventure in every one. They did bog down in book form a bit once the main subjects were covered but when presented in movie form, made for a nice adventure in the day in the life of Tarzan, Jane, Cheetah and the latest happenings in the Jungle. For entertainment, subject matter and going to the movies sake, this works and you can eat your popcorn, have your drink and be content in it. However, it works just fine on cable too. No memorable scenes makes it a movie that you don't see twice. So be it. Enjoy",The Legend of Tarzan
85,drjgardner,"Not the best, but better than most",4,8 July 2016,"There is only one Tarzan and he is Johnny Weissmuller, introduced to the world in 1932 in ""Tarzan the Ape Man"", the first of 12 films to star Weissmuller. He wasn't the first (Elmo Lincoln had the distinction in 1918), nor was he the only Tarzan during his reign from 1932 to 1948 (Buster Crabbe played him in a 12 part series called ""Tarzan the Fearless"" and Bruce Bennett did the same in 1937 under the title ""The New Adventures of Tarzan""), but he is the most memorable. Lex Barker succeeded him in 1949 to 1953 with 5 films and Gordon Scott followed Baxter from 1955 to 1960 with 6 films, and the most memorable performance among his competitors was Christopher Lambert in ""Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes"" (1984).The latest addition is ""The Legend of Tarzan"". It follows the same basic story line first offered in the Edgar Rice Burroughs series that started in 1912 as ""Tarzan of the Apes"", although there are some differences after the first half hour, and the current film is more like the 1932 film than the original novel and differs somewhat from even that film. It's an ambitious re-write of a familiar tale, and not quite successful.Alexander Skarsgard plays the new Tarzan, and he is certainly the most physically imposing of the Tarzans, even if he does lack the charm of Weissmuller or the intrigue of Lambert. None of the other characters match the level of the previous supporting players.If you're looking for a Tarzan film, watch the 1932 version or the 1984 version. This one isn't bad, but it doesn't match the quality of those two.",The Legend of Tarzan
86,Benjamin-M-Weilert,Another mindless summer movie with nothing new to offer.,4,8 March 2019,"After watching The Legend of Tarzan®, the one unanswered question I had was, ""Why was this film even made?"" If this was to cash in on the plethora of live-action reinterpretations of Disney animated films, it might have held closer to that story. If this was to make a point about racism, it was making the wrong point. If this was because it's a recognizable name with a hunky-looking protagonist, then I think they probably hit the mark.While the scenery is certainly immersive in this adaptation of an Edgar Rice Burroughs character, much of this film pulled me out of the illusion of the African jungle. Right off the bat, the ""registered trademark"" that appears after in the title reminds you that there is already plenty of media about Tarzan, and another movie probably doesn't add to it. Secondly, while a star-studded cast is a good way to get audiences into the theater, the likes of Samuel L. Jackson, Christoph Waltz, and Margo Robbie didn't seem to be portraying their characters as much as they were just themselves in period-accurate clothing. Finally, the CGI of the animals fell into the ""uncanny valley"" for me, none of them seeming realistic or even interacting with the characters at all.Since this was not an ""origin story"" film, the flashbacks to fill in the backstory, being disjointed in nature, felt like they took away from the flow of the plot. That's not to mention that the plot (and any of its sub-plots) felt contrived and cliché. Furthermore, in a day and age filled with racial tension and strife, having a white man come in and save the day while at the same time physically beating up on Africans felt a little bit too culturally insensitive to not say anything about it.Another mindless summer movie with nothing new to offer, I give The Legend of Tarzan® 2.0 stars out of 5.",The Legend of Tarzan
87,RforFilm,"The Legend of Tarzan is a fun swing into the jungle, but Tarzan himself is dull and uninteresting",5,14 July 2016,"There is something tranquil about being in the woods. I'm fortunate enough to live in an area that has lots of trees and where the sounds of the summer evening consists of cricket chirping, owls in a chorus-like hooting, and the occasional coyote howl. As a kid, though it was troublesome to taking ten minutes to get into town, living out in the countryside and woodsy area made my childhood wonderful. It was an all win situation for the family as my parents got the peace and quiet that helped them escape the stress of work while for my brother and I, we felt like little Tarzans.Okay, we didn't live in tree houses, walk around naked or swung vine to vine (grapevines don't hold people well), but the wild has plenty to call for those that are interested. Today's movie reminded me of that, as Tarzan represents the more animal-side of being human. I've never read the Edger Rice Burroughs stories nor seen any of the older live action movies, so my only experience with the character is from the 1999 Disney animated Tarzan. With updated technology and a darker tone, The Legend of Tarzan. Though we are given the origin story of Tarzan's parents dying in the jungle and being taken in by a family of gorillas, we actually cut ahead to England where Tarzan (played by Alexander Skarsgård) has returned to claim his families estate, even calling himself ""Lord Greystoke"". He's invited by the Belgian government to visit the Congo (where his old jungle was) and to examine all the progress made there, including new towns and a steam engine train. At first he declines, but is persuaded to by an American envoy, George Washington Williams (played by Samuel L. Jackson). He initially plans to go alone, but his wife Jane (played by Margot Robbie) but is also convinced in letting her join. When they arrive, they find the tribe where Jane and her father taught for years and enjoy a little reunion. The happiness is cut short when some mercenaries, led by the Belgium Léon Rom (played by Christoph Waltz) kills the tribal chief, burns several homes, and takes Jane. Tarzan and George head into the jungle to intercept the mercenaries and see where they've been taken captured tribesmen. What Tarzan doesn't know is that León wanted him to follow, leading the lord of the apes into a trap. The jungle is wild and The Legend of Tarzan seems to have the right elements for an entertaining blockbuster. The Africa here is more modernized and yet threatening like it should be. The best element of this movie is the atmosphere, as we get a variety of the country aside from trees. This is a good example on how CGI can replace the necessity of using real exotic animals. The animation on the Gorillas and other African animals looks really good. The scene alone where Tarzan is meeting with a pack of lions should be in the demo pitch for the visual effect artists looking for more work.The acting highlight is Samuel L. Jackson who is playing the only real life figure. I'd say that most of the performance is Sam's personality, but it's a welcome to the films biggest problem; it's main character. Alexander Skarsgård is beyond bland as the lord of the apes. Except for a well-built body and his communicating with the animals, he has to be the most boring rendition of Tarzan I've seen. It's a shame because everyone else is well casted including Wolf of Wall Street's Margot Robbie and Christoph Waltz whose always fun to watch as the villain. Even the action is entertaining, but our hero is so uninteresting, that a real gorilla would have been more fun to follow.I'll give this three gorillas out of five. If the rest of the movie is so well put together, why couldn't they found a better Tarzan? Even if this movie had included Phil Collins songs, it wouldn't have helped. The Legend of Tarzan would be pretty good had they taken out Tarzan.",The Legend of Tarzan
88,Anurag-Shetty,A brand new take on the iconic character.,8,21 July 2016,"The Legend of Tarzan tells the story of John Clayton/Tarzan(Alexander Skarsgard). Tarzan is living a domesticated life in London with his wife, Jane Clayton(Margot Robbie). Tarzan gets an invitation to return to his home in the jungle. He is accompanied by Jane & American envoy, George Washington Williams(Samuel L. Jackson). Once he returns to his former home in the jungle, Tarzan realizes that something is not right. Now, it is up to Tarzan to stop the forces threatening to destroy the way of life, in the jungle. The Legend of Tarzan is a superb film. The action set pieces are mind blowing. It is thrilling to see Tarzan defying the laws of gravity, as he navigates his way through the jungle. The 3D definitely adds to the overall experience of the film. The visual effects are flawless. All the animals in the film were created using CGI & they look extremely lifelike. The climax of the film is its highlight. There are two minor flaws in this movie. It takes a while to pick up steam. The first ten to fifteen minutes of the film, is quite dragging. The second flaw is, I wish they slightly expanded on Tarzan's origin story, instead of showing a few flashbacks. Alexander Skarsgard is outstanding as John Clayton/Tarzan. Skarsgard has worked really hard to acquire the Tarzan physique & the outcome is extremely positive. Samuel L. Jackson is spectacular as George Washington Williams. Jackson infuses the movie, with some much needed humor. Margot Robbie is brilliant as Jane Clayton. The chemistry between Robbie & Skarsgard is electrifying. Christoph Waltz is fantastic as Leon Rom. Djimon Hounsou is excellent as Chief Mbonga. Casper Crump is impressive as Major Kerckhover. Osy Ikhile & Jim Broadbent are good as Kwete & Prime Minister, respectively. The supporting cast is effective. The Legend of Tarzan is worth a watch. Edgar Rice Burroughs would be proud of the latest adaptation, of his beloved creation.",The Legend of Tarzan
89,fernandoschiavi,"""The Legend of Tarzan"" is the proverbial wasted potential, but that, as a whole, still manages to be superior to much remake and reboot that Hollywood has been doing",7,21 June 2020,"There are characters that transcend time, being true myths or legends - and certainly Tarzan is an example of that. Tarzan was created by Edgar Rice Burroughs. Appearing for the first time in the pulp magazine All-Story Magazine in 1912 and published in book format in 1914. The character appeared in twenty-five more books and in several separate stories, several books authorized by other authors and innumerable works in other media, authorized and unauthorized. In this new adaptation, director David Yates - responsible for directing the last four films of the Harry Potter saga and the films of the Fantastic Animals saga - brings another version of the legend and taking full advantage of everything that the character already represents. In this version, Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgård) left the African jungle almost a decade ago and adopted a new home with Jane Margot Robbie) in the mansion left by his parents. He receives an invitation to return to Africa on a diplomatic mission, but does not seem very interested in returning to his homeland until he is persuaded by George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) that something very wrong may be happening to the natives. In fact, it is a plan by the villain Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) who intends to exchange the hero for precious stones in order to get rich, negotiating with Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou), the leader of a local tribe. Tarzan sees his wife and his people threatened, John becomes Tarzan again, the man becomes a myth again.""The Legend of Tarzan"" focuses on a moment later than what is usually portrayed, the film follows the return of Lord Greystoke to his primate origins, tells the return of John Clayto III to the figure of Tarzan, a man who was civilized, who assumes his social obligations, but the call, in the form of an ambush at first, makes him a hero again, a legend again. That is how The Legend of Tarzan manages to deal with themes such as this mythical dimension of the character and the historical moment that Tarzan enters without forgetting that it is still a great adventure.Tarzan, or rather, John Clayton III goes from being the savage we saw in other film versions based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' books to becoming an arrogant aristocrat who values his routine in London more than his home on the African continent. The purpose of the film is to give another perspective to the story of a man who grew up with animals. The script of the duo Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer takes an extremely interesting path: the film is not a journey of the hero, but a return to this post. Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgard) is portrayed as a man who wants to get rid of the legends and stories that surround him, someone who wants to be recognized for acts that can be done wearing a suit and tie. So what you see on the screen is a journey back to that condition of hero, to that dimension of legend.Director David Yates manages to perfectly combine the fantastic characteristic with this realism, the Tarzan that flies like a spirit through the forest is extremely credible in that region that lives under constant threat of a civil war fueled by European governments. In addition to being cohesive, the filmmaker demonstrates a great visual accuracy, along with a photograph by Henry Braham that films the Congo dependencies with extreme delicacy using the sun and the fog of the place to create very expressive and beautiful plans, helping to give an even greater dimension. more heroic and romantic to that journey. It is true that the filmmaker often falls into some technical and aesthetic exaggerations with the excess of slow motion and mainly a belief in the role of CGI, with effects that, by seeking an extreme realism, prove to be flawed and mainly not very interesting aesthetically. Still, The Legend of Tarzan is a film that visually is above average compared to its contemporary blockbusters.A hundred years have passed, but the script by Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer has not changed the representation: Tarzan is still a rich, white, British lord who goes to Africa to lead black men who cannot survive alone. In addition, he must save the eternal damsel in distress and ensure the procreation of the species. Paternalism, colonialism and machismo are some of the elements that crossed the century and remained in the new version of history. Tarzan is a character totally linked to neo-imperialism and The Legend of Tarzan does not turn a blind eye to such issues. The sharing of African territories was somewhat inhumane, uniting rival tribes and disregarding any history, the character has always been the counterpoint of this colonization. Tarzan does not return as a white man to civilize, but as the native figure who returns to lead and unify the same people against the figure of an invader who does not bring a peace mission, but seeks an endless exploration. Alexander Skarsgård's interpretation brings the primordial Tarzan just at a glance, as the story begins with the character - John Clayton III, played by Skarsgård - completely assimilated to civilization, married to Jane (Margot Robbie) in England and being drawn back to England. Africa. Tarzan's civilizing streak is never lost, but the actor, on the other hand, can never really convince about his character's wild nature, especially because of his extreme, shaky and unnecessary close-ups when younger in the jungle, in addition to the mistaken use of rejuvenating CGI. He is in an uncomfortable middle ground between what he was and what he is, without ever really embracing one state or another.Jane (Margot Robbie) in this film is presented as a character who, like Tarzan, grew up in that region; while he was raised by gorillas in the middle of the forest, she lived in the middle of a native tribe while her father was teaching at the sites. Even though she is just a damsel in distress for much of the film, Robbie has charisma and beauty that impress, and also manages to bring a certain amount of empowerment to the character. Another one who brings this awareness of exploration is Willams (Samuel L. Jackson), an American who participated in the bloody expansion to the West in North America and who seeks to help Tarzan's mission his own redemption. At the same time, it works as a displaced and completely unnecessary comic relief.With comings and goings to the past by means of flashbacks that do not help in the fluidity of the narrative, but that undoubtedly add important information to it, The Legend of Tarzan is the proverbial wasted potential, but that, as a whole, still manages to be superior to much remake and reboot that Hollywood has been doing. The visual effects of the feature, which is based only on that, are also not impressive. Gorillas, bison and even the forest in the background do not show veracity, making the look, which should be the main point due to the immersion of the feature in the jungle, little credible. They fulfill their role in moments of contemplation, but seem artificial when the rush takes over history - see the train scene and the run on the vines. Unlike ""Mogli or ""Dawn of the Planet of the Apes"", ""The Legend of Tarzan"" cannot integrate digital nature with human characters without a strangeness effect. By wanting to show off too much, the technology ends up drawing attention to itself, sounding artificial.The montage of the scenes also leaves something to be desired, failing to create a coherent and fluid story. In this age of fast images and cult of spectacle, the film strives to create frantic twists, even when they don't serve the narrative much, while director David Yates uses slow motion cameras to supposedly prolong the effect of the conflict. This makes sense in a contemporary film, but aesthetically speaking, it does not create any particularly memorable scene: the set brings the minimum that is expected of a project of this proportion.""The Legend of Tarzan"" does not lie to the viewer. Fans of the iconic character will find everything expected from the story: swings between the trees in the forest, the powerful scream from the jungle, the passion for Jane, a wicked villain who despises nature; moments of danger and redemption, speeches about humanism and ecology. For a large production, the film does not disappoint expectations either. David Yates' work is, above all, a great adventure, perhaps one of the best of the year, with a pleasant tone throughout the work that balances its realism. At a certain moment, Tarzan and his companions need to get on a moving train, the heroes jump from a huge tree, flying through the vines and carrying out an assault that resembles the best of the wild West, an essential reference for any self-respecting adventure.",The Legend of Tarzan
90,spookyrat1,One Slippery Vine Too Many !,5,20 June 2019,"I'm not sure there was ever really a Tarzan-like call to reboot the fictional jungle character created by Edgar Rice Burroughs. But in a film-making era dominated by productions centred around super heroes and other like comic book characters, I guess it's understandable that thought be given to resurrecting the original pulp wilderness daredevil. With a $180 million budget and the combined talents of a skilled experienced cast and veteran Harry Potter franchise director David Yates running the show, you'd be forgiven for having expectations, that The Legend of Tarzan would turn out to be more successful and attractive than it proves to be.There's the feeling that attempts were made to update a (normally) 19th century white male hero with an aura of 21st century cultural values with this production, but ultimately commercial ambitions seem to have decreed that contrivance and derivative regulation should rule supreme. So once again, we have Christoph Waltz as Captain Léon Rom doing his corrupt, merciless, but notably intelligent and polite villain gig. It's ironic that Quentin Tarantino brought the urbane Waltz to the attention of the cinema world in Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds with his unforgettably sinister portrayal of SS-Standartenführer Hans Landa. But since then, seemingly only Tarantino, casting Waltz as white knight German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz in Django Unchained has ever appeared to really try to shine a different character light on the actor. Similarly Samuel L Jackson revisits his Mace Windu/ Nick Fury ""important sidekick"" persona, when interpreting a version of George Washington Williams, a true historical figure, but here a gun-toting secret agent of the US government. Margot Robbins is radiant and arguably the movie's best asset as a plucky, courageous Jane, but when all is said and done, still just plays a damsel in distress for 75% of the running time. The best that can be said of Alexander Skarsgard is that he looks the part. We know he's a fine actor from his earlier film and TV work, but here, he delivers a king of the jungle who is just emotionless and wooden. Perhaps he became psyched out by Yates's overuse and indulgence of CGI technology. After all the sight of Tarzan's carefree swinging through trees with his gorilla pals and leading an enormous Jurassic Park like animal cavalry charge on a river town does seem pretty silly, rather than exciting.This brings me to the TLOT's greatest weakness; the storyline. When it's not being burdened with a succession of flashbacks attempting to sketch a too brief, trailer-like origin tale, we just get a narrative where logic and common sense do not prevail over forward movement of the story. A few stand outs from the many examples in the movie, not already mentioned above, should suffice to make my point.Tarzan's adopted African village and its inhabitants are visibly threatened by a band of mercenaries. But where's our hero to help out? Well, he comes on the scene too late to do a lot, because apparently he and Jane slept in and weren't woken up by the various screams and shouts of their desperate friends.Jane and a friend dive off the baddies' steam boat, in the process, escaping the seeking jaws of some willing CGI hippos whilst swimming to shore and running through the near impenetrable jungle ... where they astoundingly proceed to once again meet up with the bad guys, who have somehow contrived to dock their large boat and telepathically exactly know where the 2 escapees were running to, in this same impenetrable jungle. See, it was time that Jane needed to exhibit some independent derring do, but her character was still required as a damsel in distress and had to be recaptured by the enemy.The ever-athletic Tarzan needs to chase the bad guys on foot across various scenic facets of the African landscape. He understandably tells Williams that he won't be able to keep up with him. and needs to stay with ""the others"". Williams says he'll be able to keep up and ... unnaturally does. With the spirit and fortitude of a marathon runner (hilariously sometimes carrying his various weapons, sometimes without,) he does ... without explanation. He even jumps off cliffs and nimbly lands on the boughs of trees, wearing riding boots no less, because the story calls for him to be Tarzan's sidekick.Ultimately despite its huge budget and opulent look, The Legend of Tarzan will not light a fuse igniting a new franchise. It's too solemn, too dull, too ridiculous and too-filled with a sense of its own self importance. The original jungle wild man ends up looking decidedly tame.",The Legend of Tarzan

92,dave-mcclain,"""The Legend of Tarzan"" effectively updates a classic character, puts him in a compelling historical context and gives us a fresh story with quality acting and visuals.",9,2 July 2016,"There's a lot of a history here – literal and literary – when it comes to the action-adventure movie ""The Legend of Tarzan"" (PG-13, 1:49). The titular ""Lord of the Apes"", is one of the most enduring and iconic characters in all of literature. Created by American author Edgar Rice Burroughs in 1912, Tarzan has been the subject of about 100 feature films, dating back to the silent film era (and has also inspired pop culture incarnations including TV series, radio programs, comic books, video games, etc.). The 2016 film places the fictional character in the middle of the real-life story of the European rape of the continent of Africa in the late 1800s. The Berlin Conference of 1884-1885 effectively divided up almost the entire continent among imperialistically-inclined European nations such as Great Britain, France, Germany, Spain, Portugal, Italy and, perhaps the most infamous of all participants in the age of The New Imperialism, Belgium. That country's King Leopold II ""only"" got one prize in The Partition of Africa, but it was one of the largest and was right in the geographical center of the continent – the Congo. Most of the Congo River Basin became the ""Congo Free State"" and wasn't just ruled by Belgium, but was personally ""owned"" and managed by Leopold. He exploited the region for its natural resources, such as ivory and rubber, and for the labor of its native population. The Belgians (much like other colonial powers) used their superior western technology to subjugate the Africans, brutally oppress them and use them as slaves to enrich their European masters. It took the people of Africa decades to become completely free of this hegemony but before freedom came to pass, about half of the Congo's 20 million inhabitants had died. 2016's Tarzan becomes personally involved in the early stages of this process.This film is an origin story with less origin and more story. We first meet Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgård) in his capacity as Viscount Greystoke, a member of the British Parliament's House of Lords. He is happily married to Jane (Margot Robbie), his one true love. He is enjoying the life that was his birthright, inherited from his parents who were shipwrecked and died in Africa, leading to him being raised by apes, until he's discovered and brought to Europe. We see parts of that story in brief flashbacks, but this film's focus is on the ""present"". The British Prime Minister (Jim Broadbent) communicates an invitation from King Leopold II of Belgium, ostensibly to come to the Congo and see all the good things that the King is doing for the natives. Lord Greystoke has no desire to go back to the wilds of Africa, but he is persuaded by George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson), a U.S. government representative who is skeptical of the Belgian activities in the Congo and wants to see conditions on the ground for himself.It turns out that Leopold's invitation was a ruse. The King is not making as much money from the Congo's natural resources as he had hoped, so he has sent Captain Léon Rom (Christoph Waltz) to central Africa seeking out new sources of income. Rom is looking for some rumored diamond mines when he runs into Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou) and his warriors. Unaware of how ruthless the Belgians can be, Mbonga offers Rom access to the region's treasures in exchange for Tarzan, with whom the chief has a score to settle. Hence, King Leopold's ""invitation"". Upon their arrival in the ""Free State of Congo"", Greystoke and Jane reunite with old friends, but their joy is short-lived, thanks to Rom's cruelty. Greystoke, quickly returning to Tarzan mode, does what he can to help the natives, protect his wife and stop Rom, while Williams does his best to keep up and help Tarzan when he can.""The Legend of Tarzan"" swings for the trees – and makes it! Writers Craig Brewer (""Hustle and Flow"") and Adam Kozad (""Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit"") do a great job of taking the timeless character of Tarzan, setting him against an actual historical conflict and giving us a story that is interesting and fresh. There's a distinctly modern sensibility to the script (and you won't finish this movie with a very positive impression of western governments of the late 19th century), but Brewer and Kozad remain true to the spirit of the original character and incorporate aspects of a couple different Tarzan books along the way. Director David Yates (he of the last four ""Harry Potter"" films) brings us impressive visuals and proves himself a master of tone and pacing, giving us both narrative heft and old-school cinematic excitement.Yates' cast simply doesn't have a weak link. Skarsgård makes a perfect Tarzan. His well-publicized strict four-month diet and exercise regimen (under the supervision of trainer and nutritionist, Magnus Lygdback) has given him a body that looks like that of someone who grew up among apes swinging from trees and, as an actor, he strikes just the right balance between brooding and determined. Meanwhile, Robbie's Jane creates a modern version of the ""damsel in distress"" – desirable and vulnerable, but also intelligent and independent. Jackson seems to be here mainly for comic relief, but maintains his usual strength and dignity, while managing a physicality and a variety of facial expressions that I can't remember seeing from him before. Waltz has carved out a nice Hollywood career playing immoral or morally ambiguous characters and gives us another great one here – perhaps his most despicable yet.""The Legend of Tarzan"" effectively updates a classic character, puts him in a compelling historical context and establishes who he is while giving us a fresh story with quality acting and visuals.

Jackson), an American activist, convinces him that slavery is being perpetrated on the people of Africa.Very early on, it is shown that Tarzan is being lured to the Congo by the conniving Belgian diamond miner and war monger Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) in order to make a deal with Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou) leader of a tribe. The plot jumps back in time making this movie serve as both an origin story and a sequel to the original story of when Tarzan met Jane. Despite veteran actors, all of the acting is just these people going through their routine, Waltz doing a proper foreign villain, Skarsgård doing smoldering, six-pack, sexy, Robbie doing sassy and tough, and Jackson doing funny one-liners while serving as the moral compass.

94,witster18,Nothing to See Here.. Move Along... Move Along...,4,12 November 2016,"To think that this film is scored very close to say, ""Greystoke:The Legend of Tarzan"", is absolutely comical. I do believe we'll see a gigantic fall- off after about a month of DVD release. It should settle at about 5.7-5.9 in the near future. I do recommend watching that earlier film. ""The Legend of Tarzan"" has an interesting chronological take on the Tarzan legend, and some of the film without the frantic action-CGI stuff actually looks pretty good, but that's where the interest ends.Much of the film is riddled with ridiculously over-the-top CGI. The dialog is severely under-written, and the acting isn't much better. There's absolutely nothing here to draw-us in and care about any of these characters. And where the time-jumping helps in certain areas, it hurts in others. Christolph Waltz is a fantastic actor, but not even he can do anything with this dreadful script. I've only seen about 20 films from 2016, but this is the early front-runner for the worst film of the year - that I'll see anyway. Watching the last hour was like sitting at the airport during 4-5 flight delays. Just get me outta here.If you like surfing wildebeasts it might be your bag. Margo Robbie is gorgeous, but her efforts here are even more futile than Megan Fox's in Jonah Hex. Yes, even Jonah Hex is better than this Tarzan film. I hope that saves you some time. Tons of little problems, but the big problem is the dialog, which is bare as the desert, and dumb as a rock.I would defo pass on this.You might like this if you LOVED: peter jackson's KIng Kong, Tranformer's Revenge of the Fallen, or Indian Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull. And this would be the worst among those.",The Legend of Tarzan

Sorry Christophe but having seen you in 2-3 films of late your performance appears to be the same....in this one, you go thru the jungle for several days, run like mad away from a huge glut of rampaging animals and yet the ""white suit"" hasnt 1 speck of dirt on it...WOW! Mr Yates, how do you do that-more than 1 suit?....Both Tarzan and Jane work well as does Samuel L Jackson in his role, the good guys with some help from the animal kingdom do work well, although with the more modern abilities of computer generation, the actors may not be required to work as hard as yesteryear. very enjoyable, especially for the younger generation I would think.",The Legend of Tarzan

98,griffolyon12,A Well Done Adaptation,8,30 June 2016,"More and more lately I am discovering a disconnect between myself and the vast majority of movie critics. I have loved a lot of movies this year that they've hated, and that trend continues here with The Legend of Tarzan. As far as live-action interpretations of Tarzan go, this and Greystoke are the two champs, with The Legend of Tarzan edging out Greystoke by a teeny bit.The Legend of Tarzan is unique in that it's not an origin story. While the origins of Tarzan are explored in a few flashback scenes (reminding me a lot of Batman Begins), the movie is really about John Clayton, Lord of Greystoke (aka Tarzan's real name and title). Tarzan has been living in England with Jane for the past few years and has left the jungle behind him, but when he is asked to help expose a slavery ring in the Congo, he is drawn back to Africa.Harry Potter director, David Yates, manages to breathe new life into Tarzan thanks to the modern technological wizardry that CGI enables. The vast majority of this movie was all shot on sets in England, with pretty much all of the animals and African environments created by a computer. This sells the reality of the story, much in the same way that The Jungle Book did a few months back. Of course what really makes this movie resonant is not the craft on display, but the story between Tarzan and Jane.Alexander Skarsgard and Margot Robbie portray Tarzan and Jane in this movie, and they actually make you care about these two characters. Skarsgard plays Tarzan as a stoic gentleman trying not to be the animal he was raised to be, while Robbie portrays the feistiest Jane you've ever seen. Then there's the charisma and humor of Samuel L. Jackson as real-life historical figure, Dr. George Washington Williams, who joins Tarzan on his quest to save the Congo. Couple that with Christoph Waltz being Christoph Waltz as the bad guy, Leon Rom, and you've got a fun, emotionally resonant pulp adventure that Tarzan author, Edgar Rice Burroughs, would most likely be proud of.When it gets right down to it, don't listen to the critics on this one. Your enjoyment of The Legend of Tarzan all relies on how much you enjoy the idea of Tarzan in general. If you think Tarzan is hokey, then this movie probably isn't for you, but there is nothing wrong with the movie itself. The script is good, the movie is well directed, the cinematography and musical score are beautiful, and there are many well choreographed action sequences. The bottom line is, if you have an affinity for the character, The Legend of Tarzan is the Tarzan movie you've been looking for.I give The Legend of Tarzan an 8 out of 10!",The Legend of Tarzan
99,mfellipecampos,Regular,5,3 February 2021,"The hero's trajectory, this is Tarzan's new film, it contains all those basic clichés, the visual and animal effects are just good (nothing compared to Planet of the Apes, for example), the performances are weak, except for Samuel Jackson, the film's photography is beautiful and surprising at times, despite the excess of Cromaqui, and the scenes with out-of-context audio from flashbacks there Spike Jonzen, and the soundtrack is imperceptible, I didn't read the books, but I saw the animation from the 90s, which is much better, the film fails to explore the conflict between the Tarzan between the world that was wild and the civilized, that many times wild animals love unconditionally and without judgments because they are irrational, this is brushed up in the film but very little explored, here is my condolences to the script that disappoint.

100,RussHog,Well made bad movie,5,16 May 2020,This is one of those strange movie that is competently held together and very Hollywood. But at the same time - it's also so ridiculous and stupid. Tarzan is played quite well by the lead - in fact the whole cast does a decent job. The CGI is kinda corny but it isn't so bad the movie is unwatchable. The themes of the film are kinda strange - I think I prefer the Tarzan Legend of Greystoke type film where Tarzan leaves the jungle and goes into the real world. But whatever. This film is just a run of the mill Hollywood movie that is well made but bad.,The Legend of Tarzan
101,CANpatbuck3664,The Legend of Tarzan Isn't The Legendary Flop it Has Been Made Out to Be,7,12 July 2016,"I don't think I heard a positive word about The Legend of Tarzan leading up to it's release. It was all talk about how it was destined to flop and the gigantic budget that Warner Bros threw at it. So it was easy to go into the movie with low expectations and hope for the best. I wish I could follow a lot of the reviews on here saying it was the best Tarzan movie I've seen (I'm still partial to the Disney animated Tarzan) but it's not nearly as bad as it's low rotten tomatoes score suggests.*Minor Spoilers Ahead* In the late 19th century, some of the land in African Congo region is still being divided up. King Leopold of Belgium is in trouble, he's defaulting on his loans and will have them called soon. His head representative Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) has been sent by him to make a deal with Chief Mbonga (Djimon Honsou) who controls a region where diamonds are plentiful. They're able to locate his tribe but the armed escort is butchered by Mbonga's followers. Leon is able to defend himself however and is able to to make a deal with Mbonga promising to trade him Tarzan (who Mbonga has a grudge against for reasons I won't spoil) for enough diamonds to help Leopold pay off his debts.We then move to England where a committee of Lords including the Prime Minister (Jim Broadbent) are trying to convince the Earl of Greystoke aka John Clayton III aka Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgaard) to take a trip to the Congo to investigate Leopold's claims of rejuvenated Congo where it is now a slavery free state. Tarzan is the closest thing to a celebrity that the Congo has according to George Washington Williams (Samuel L Jackson) who's an American representative at the meeting, so that's why Clayton got the invitation. John says he's tired of Africa and says no. When he leaves, George follows him out saying that he needs to go. There's strong evidence to suggest Leopold is using slave labour to run the colony and with Williams being a Civil War hero is trying to expose it. John reconsiders and decides to go talk to his wife Jane (Margot Robbie).Jane is a schoolteacher and John finds her in the middle of a lesson at their mansion. He kindly interrupts it and after answering some questions from the children who know he is Tarzan, asks to speak to his wife alone. He tells Jane about his plan and Jane who was essentially raised in Africa is excited to go back. John tells her she cannot come because of her recent miscarriage. She becomes upset and accuses him of coddling her. He finds her the next morning and seeing how upset she is, he reconsiders his position and tells her she can come.All the talk surrounding this movie has been about the big numbers on the budget, not how the movie looks. I thought it was a little disappointing, the closest comparison is the Disney release The Jungle Book and TJB was the better looking of the two. There's a lot of animal CGI and again if you compare the two, it isn't a competition. But on the flip side, the movie did have some interesting looking action. It was fun to see Tarzan swinging through the jungle and dealing with the wildlife. The way the movie portrays the Congo isn't necessarily new but you don't get to see it in the blockbuster season and it was fun to have a different setting. So while maybe the budget should have been smaller, the visual effects were still solid.Another regret when it comes to the lack of success this movie has had is that they did a pretty good job casting it, getting some talented people in the right roles. I don't know Alexander Skarsgard very well but he's very well cast as Tarzan. He's got the physicality for the role and you want to follow him as Tarzan. I think he's let down by the script more than anything. I'm a big Margot Robbie fan and she's the standout again. She's also a victim of the script but through her energy, she makes Jane memorable and interesting. Christoph Waltz was pretty restrained even though it's a lot of his typical villain stuff. I was a little disappointed in Samuel L Jackson, he's a great actor but considering he's actually playing an actual historical character, it felt like he was playing Samuel L Jackson again.I did have 2 problems with this movie. The pacing feels off, there are a lot of important flashbacks and they're well done but they screw with the flow of the plot. The other problem is the actual character development. We know a lot about Tarzan but he's so serious all the time. He barely cracks a smile and with how little fun he seems to be having, it limits how much fun you can have with the movie. We also learn a lot about his past but his attitude and his ideals don't evolve much over the movie. They setup Jane to be a strong heroine but end up stranding her on a boat for a long time. Lastly, I wanted to see more of Chief Mbonga's perspective. Djimon is an underrated actor but he feels like an afterthought.I liked this movie a lot more than I didn't. It offers a perspective on Tarzan that I hadn't seen before and I enjoyed that. There was lots of potential for a new franchise here. I think if they had just kept expectations lower, this could have been a sleeper hit (instead like Batman v Superman, it's not a flop and it's not a hit so no one's happy). Still, the movie was fun but flawed, I'd actually rate it a 7.5/10 but because it has some big stumbling points I'll give it 7/10.",The Legend of Tarzan
102,Laakbaar,Ponderous,6,29 January 2017,"I should have liked this movie. I remember reading the novels when I was a kid. I've followed the Tarzan franchise over the decades.It's true that this is a gorgeous, technically well made movie.And yet it just didn't work. The movie was ponderous. There wasn't anything fun or exciting or even interesting about it. A lot of scenes were set in Victorian England. It was over-reaching. Just too much. The movie didn't engage me. For this I blame the writing and the direction.Part of my problem for me is Alexander Skarsgard. He performed his role well, but he is just not the image of Tarzan I had in my head when I read the novels. He looks more like a Russian dancer or something.It's probably worth about a 7.5 but I'm going to lower that to 6 because I'm p*ssed off at how tedious it was.",The Legend of Tarzan

Christoph Waltz is well he is Christoph Waltz, he is good but pretty much the same in every movie he has ever been in. Samuel L. Jackson was a pointless addition to the movie and I didn't really get what his character was adding to the plot. Margot Robbie was the only actor I believed and she stood out in every scene she was in. But this movie that could have been so good, just didn't quite get there. Why? The plot was not too bad but throughout I kept thinking, yeah right, the action was unrealistic, Tarzan fighting a Gorilla? Gorilla's could rip a mans arm off, they are ten times as strong as men. Gorilla's also do not swing through trees on vines, certainly not full grown males. I also found Tarzan inconsistent, looked a bit of a wimp in some scenes and almost super human in others.

The more I thought about this movie, the more I realized just how bad it is. It's not this is necessarily a poorly made movie. Save for Alexander Skarsgård's stupid expression for the entire movie, there really isn't a lot to rip on this movie for. Yet there is not a single thing to appreciate. It's predictable, it's got attractive actors, and it's all around just an average movie. It's like the director and producers pulled out their checklist with everything a movie needs to function, then built a script around each thing on that list. Attractive actors? Check. Flashbacks? Check. Rushed introductions to the characters' previous life and connections? Check. Quirky comic relief character? Check. Over-the-top climax? Check. Doesn't matter whether or not it actually makes sense, so long as it makes money. That's this whole movie. It's not special, it's not interesting, it's terribly, hopelessly generic and it gets worse with every passing second, whether I'm watching it or thinking about it. Overall The Legend of Tarzan is not worth talking anymore about. It's relentlessly generic, and that's it. There's nothing to it. Do yourself a favor, skip this one.

105,billygoat1071,Worthy Bombast,6,1 July 2016,"The Legend of Tarzan is one of the strangest blockbusters I've seen this year. It kinda reminded me of Ridley Scott's Robin Hood where your favorite parts of the source material are replaced with political talk which is supposed to be boring, but since it's stunningly directed, it's oddly entertaining.Except 2010's Robin Hood manages to succeed of ending up being a medieval epic. The Legend of Tarzan on the other hand... you don't exactly know where it's heading. It juggles so much themes and subplots; you can sense there is a rich lore around, but the movie doesn't exactly flourish them properly, at the very least. It's just one plot point after another.On the technical side, again, the directing work is captivating. The action may go out of nowhere crazy, but focusing on the production and the atmosphere alone make it quite fascinating to watch.The acting is predictable, but it's fine. Christophe Waltz plays a watchable cartoon villain, Margot Robbie does what she usually does, Alexander Skarsgard makes a convincing reserved/feral Tarzan and Samuel L. Jackson brings the energy that helps brightening things up in this rather gloomy version of the tale.The Legend of Tarzan overall takes itself into some interesting directions, but it's also a strange mess. It can be impressive in its filmmaking and entertaining when everybody stops explaining stuff. It's a mixed bag at best. People might clamor it could have been a little more lighthearted fun as Samuel L. Jackson's character's bantering, because once you realize what kind of movie this actually is, there is no turning back.",The Legend of Tarzan

108,davidgee,Bring back the men in monkey-suits,7,23 July 2016,"The latest reboot of this venerable franchise uses CGI instead of the wildlife footage and extras in gorilla-suits we put up with in the era of Weissmuller and Mahoney and co. Alexander Skarsgard, like Christopher Lambert in 1984's elegant (but plodding) GREYSTOKE, is a leaner meaner Tarzan than some of the steroidal hunks you see in the gym who might like a crack at the role. The story – our handsome hero returns to the jungle he grew up in to liberate the natives from enslavement by a vicious mine-owner – has echoes of some of the older plots in the series (much like the Bond movies), with some atmospheric scenes of Tarzan in his post-African role as Lord of a Manor (his bride is now Lady Jane, which brings unintended echoes of Lady Chatterley!). THE LEGEND OF TARZAN is faithful to the spirit if not to the letter of the Edgar Rice Burroughs source material.The 'foundation' story, his childhood talking to the animals, is told here in a series of crisp flashbacks. This works very well, intercut with the developing rescue drama. The cinematography does full justice to the glories of the African landscape.The Victorian period flavour is well maintained (as it was in 1984), and the story is nearly as fast and furious as an Indiana Jones escapade. Skarsgard brings glamour and charisma to the title role. Margot Robbie's Jane has a luminous beauty that reminded me of the early Sophia Loren. Samuel L. Jackson makes the best he can of a thankless role as the inept but valiant sidekick and Christoph Waltz recycles his recent resurrection of Blofeld with little visible effort.There's not much originality here but it makes for colourful and thrilling entertainment. Hobbits and Harry Potter should have accustomed us to digital creatures by now, but I did find the CGI animals lacked credibility and made me – almost – nostalgic for extras in monkey-suits.",The Legend of Tarzan
109,grendelkhan,This is Tarzan,8,12 October 2016,"This is the Tarzan movie I waited for, for my entire life. I grew up with Weismuller on TV, plus the various other Tarzans, the comics from Gold Key, then DC and Marvel (and other independents), Phillip Jose Farmer's fictional biography (Tarzan Alive!), the Filmation cartoon and the Ron Ely TV series. I've actually only read a couple of the books; but, this is what I wanted to see in a Tarzan film. Tarzan is both the articulate Englishman John Clayton and the Lord of the Apes. This is pulp. Tarzan has always been pulp and this captures it. Of course his physical feats are beyond compare; that's pulp. Why anyone expects differently from a Tarzan movie is beyond me.The film does a nice job of peppering the Tarzan origin throughout the film, establishing the literal Legend of Tarzan. We get the stories before we get the man, as the Jungle Lord. It never strays too far from believable emotion and character, yet never loses sight of being a pulp adventure. The reviews I read seem to have more political agendas in mind than actually watching an adventure film. Burroughs, like most adventure writers of his era (and most writers, in general) has problems when viewed through the lens of history. His stories were racist at times, elitist at times; yet, he could write a darn good adventure yarn. That's what this film is; a darn good, old fashioned adventure yarn, featuring one of the greatest adventure heroes, ever.The film isn't pure Burroughs; but, it gets the breakneck style of plotting down, as the story speeds along, from one set piece to another. These things were written for magazines and the idea was to keep the reader turning the page. The film captures that and keeps you anticipating what comes next. It withholds things enough to have you anticipating and cheering when they come. John Clayton enters Africa in European clothes, and soon encounters old friends. As he spends more time in Africa, he strips away more and more of the European accouterments. He withholds the famous Tarzan yell until late in the film, keeping you waiting for that moment. When we here it, we look at the villain and say, ""Now you're really in for it!""The film isn't perfect; Jane is still in need of rescue, though she puts up a decent fight. She's established as someone who is on par with Tarzan, who also loves Africa and can hold her own. Even Tarzan gets taken down pretty easily, early on. That happened in the books, too. He would get loose, though and woe betide the person who was at the receiving end of his wrath. The climax is a bit much; but, it's pulp and it's Tarzan. Tarzan isn't about subtlety.Like another Burroughs property, John Carter, I think too many reviews were looking at this as something else, rather than what it was. It's an adventure movie, with a larger than life hero. It isn't history, it isn't a post-modern deconstruction. It's Tarzan!",The Legend of Tarzan

A typical product of some Hollywood producer trying to make a ""modern"" take of Tarzan not really knowing or caring for the Tarzan that Edgar Rice Burroughs created.  In particular it was the palest and most underwhelming Tarzan character yet. He never radiated the strength nor the intelligence that Edgar Rice Burroughs attributed to his character. He spent most of the movie going around with a bland look on his face.The story itself is pretty much an out of the box standard Hollywood story about slavery and abuse of the black African population. Not truly bad but nothing to write home about either.There is a lot of CGI in the movie and although quite a few reviewers seem to consider it bad I personally though it was pretty okay. One of the few decent bits of the movie.I truly do not understand that they had the nerve to call this movie The Legend of Tarzan since it really is pretty far from the legend of Tarzan that Edgar Rice Burroughs created.

112,dcarsonhagy,Me Tarzan!,6,11 October 2016,"The Legend of Tarzan tries (sometimes successfully, sometimes not) to attach a different tale to the story of the man of the jungle, i.e. Tarzan. Losing both parents and being raised by apes, the ape man meets and falls in love with the beautiful Jane, who teaches at a local village, they move back to Greystoke, and all is well that ends well. Not so much the case here.Alexander Skarsgard plays Tarzan. Many have said he was horribly miscast, and I disagree. I would think living in the wild most of his life, Lord Greystoke/Tarzan would not be a man of many words. So, what in the hell did the critics expect: Shakespeare? It seems there some underhandedness going on in the Congo, so Tarzan is asked to investigate. Little does he know, someone is setting him up. I am growing very tired by people who just have to insist EVERY movie that comes out today has a racist undertone. I would love to sit down with these goons--although I'm sure it would be a complete waste of time--and try to untangle their idiotic minds. Wasn't it Freud who said, ""sometimes a cigar is just a cigar""? However, I have also found that a good majority of readers of anyone's reviews on this site are not going to like your review regardless of what you do. Those are the saddest people. They have no life so they feel they must s**t all over everything. But, I digress. I enjoyed the performances of everyone especially Samuel L. Jackson and one of the best villains to ever grace the screen, Christoph Waltz. The cinematography was exceptional, as some of the shots left me just about breathless. This movie is rated PG-13 for violence and brief nudity. If you went to see it expecting constant Tarzan howls, Cheetah, and unnecessary scenes of Tarzan grappling with crocodiles, lions, tigers, and bears, so sorry for you. I enjoyed it because it entertained me. More of a 6.5 rating than a 6.",The Legend of Tarzan
113,James_De_Bello,5/10,5,20 July 2016,"Did you think you knew Tarzan's story? Well Warner Bros. is here to prove you wrong. In their new re-imagining of the iconic character the story takes place further down the line: Tarzan (Alexander Skarsgard) now goes by the name of John Clayton, living as noble lord in London, married to Jane (Margot Robbie). Yet, when Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz), trying to conquer Congo for the king of Belgium, invites John down in Congo to set a trap in exchange for diamonds, Tarzan, Jane and his local friends have to find a way to overpower Rom's twisted scheme.I have to admit that I wasn't anyways intrigued by this film, probably because I was never able to grasp or enjoy the story and mythology behind the titular character. Yet, out of loyalty to David Yates, who in my opinion and probably solely in my opinion, made one of the best films of all time in ""Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince"", I wanted to go check out his work no matter what. I came out still believing he is a truly gifted director, but not even he could overcome the boring and empty narrative this film contains.Right from the opening shot Yates manages to create an atmosphere that is unique, different and personal, you are immediately glued to the screen for how he manages to stage visually the movie. There is an immediate tone, I have to admit I was expecting, and it throws you off balance in a good way, my attention was devolved entirely to the film.As always Yates does fantastic visual storytelling and he had repeatedly moments in the film of slow building and quiet pace that were not at all what I was excepting from a Tarzan film and were definitely a great surprise. He then juxtaposes these moments to sweeping camera movements with incredible swiftness in the times of action an running which were absolutely beautiful and riveting from a solely based on the visual splendor value.The film also has to be commended for having its heart in a really good place, the wide use of ethnic actors, location, cultural respect and overall message were all things of primal emphasis and they were most certainly a pleasant and story dictated element that really worked. The intentions the filmmakers have are the most noble and whilst their message of respect for nature and culture doesn't really emerge in the context, you can see where they're coming from and it is a very good place.Unfortunately all of the above is simply undermined by a narrative void of any character depth, interesting theme or coherent structure. It is plainly and simply boring, there is rarely any real danger or stakes, it is full of dull clichés and basically gives nothing to do to any of the actors who almost all appear flat because of it, with the possible exception of Christoph Waltz who does manage to emerge and give the character a beat on screen and a driving cause that you understand.This adaptation of the legendary story fails to deliver anything of note as a filmmaking effort, yet its good heart and redeemable features make it a harmless film that I still can recommend to families if finding themselves short on things to see.",The Legend of Tarzan

115,scottshak_111,An entirely different take on the story of Tarzan,7,21 July 2016,"Aptly named as the song that spoke of his feral legends sung by tribals, it is an above average flick that has been beautifully helmed by David Yates. Even though the style of frame depiction is sheer amazeballs, The Legend of Tarzan isn't exactly all goodies either.DIRECTION OF THE LEGEND OF TARZAN I have a mixed feeling about Yates direction. Bits where he chooses different angles to depict a grim situation, cashing in on the intensity makes every frame powerful. He aces such frames with badass music in the backdrop. However there are moments where his frames tumble into the shoddy territory. Like when he starts rotating the camera around a character who is delivering generic dialogues, it is hard to take him seriously. Action scenes in Legend of Tarzan are very unsteady, and it is almost impossible to focus on what's really happening until it's all over. Either the characters are too zoomed in or not properly shown. There are plenty of areas where this is evident.Music is brilliantly chosen and imparts quite a darker comportment to the movie. Screenplay is kind of okay. There are two to three memorable one liners that will definitely wiggle your ears. The other moments, however, your ears will stay parched in need of some intelligent literary lines.PLOT OF THE LEGEND OF TARZAN Another area where Tarzan scores profusely is the plot. It comes with a good one, beating the clichés of the jungle tale. The only sad thing is that revisiting the old story is like a constant to and fro motion. It is done at awkward junctures, without choosing a proper way to deliver the complete storyline. Visuals are average. Sometimes you see the CGI dwindle too much taking things towards the animated crossroads.Alexander Skarsgard works magnificently in the shoes of the legendary Tarzan. He creates a more silent and darker aired hero who let his grim nature do the talking for him.You will also find humour at weird junctures in The Legend of Tarzan, mostly coming from Samuel L. Jackson as George Washington Williams and his shenanigans but most of it is bland.SPOILERS CLINGING HEREON Conversations between Leon Rom and Jane Clayton are the worst. There is something wrong with their timing, and the fact that Yates is okay with it, will leave you scratching your head. Also, you cannot overlook the constant disconnect there is to the tale. Just when you begin to think that something is going to happen, the frame changes to a different timeline entirely. It is a constant wrestle between the frames that takes out the tangibility from the movie.BADASS MOMENTS TO REMEMBER The Legend of Tarzan is gorgeously blended with moments that resuscitate elements from his past. The first one being the cubs he grew up with. There is a moment where he bows down to grown up versions of lions and lionesses, who recognize him and rub their heads against him in mute affection. Also, the fight between Akut and Tarzan is definitely one of the most theatrical bits of the tale. The mere fact that he fights with someone whom he can't defeat is ballsy per se. When he tries to save Jane by covering her with his body is both romantic and brave. Another one where he beats a box of soldiers to pulp with his bare hands is one helluva eye-candy.THE FINAL VERDICT The Legend of Tarzan has its ups and downs that constantly keep playing with your head. There are flaws galore at the same time beautiful moments to be cherished. I would say go for it, so you don't regret not watching it, if there are future sequels planned.",The Legend of Tarzan
116,coreyjdenford,Aaaahahaahhha,4,6 July 2016,"This is my review for The Legend Of Tarzan (spoiler free)** (2/5)Cast: Alexander Skarsgard, Samuel L. Jackson, Margot Robbie, Djimon Hounsou, Christoph Waltz.Plot: Tarzan (Skarsgard), having acclimated to life in London, is called back to his former home in the jungle to investigate the activities at a mining encampment.Oh god Tarzan! What have we done to you? Back in 1999 Tarzan was released as a Disney animation and it worked because after that it became a Disney classic, then there was Tarzan in 2013 which became sort of a CGI based live action movie. This has taken the same spot and turned into a live action CGI based action movie tat used to be Tarzan. Instead of being Legendary he is just a normal human with a monkey prowess unfortunately in terms of summer blockbusters this isn't the best and definitely not the most entertaining. It has an immensely beautiful landscape of the African jungle and of the Savanna and is completely surrounded by intense action with okay CGI which is a little bit schlocky at points. But the tepid plot makes this an un-enjoyable ride see that's what this movie is bad for is the plot, and also the irritating villain Christoph Waltz's Leon Rom you'd think that with two Oscars to his name he'd be better well he's not, as much as he tries to be charming and an efficient member of the story but unfortunately as charismatic he is you just want to have less screen time than he really has. Big movies like this tend to have quite a starry cast but they just don't realize that the more people there is in a movie it's not going to be any better, a lot of stars there may be but one them is awful. Alexander Skarsgard maybe in many blockbusters like Battleship (2012) but he's not what you'd call a ""god given actor"" because he's just emotionless and just dry.As much as English director David Yates tries to make this as good as his few Harry Potter movies it fails in many ways, because it has his traditional directing style but the editing is just unworthy and also the plot is muddled because it drifts between convoluted plot in real life to action packed madness and then flashbacks, which coincidentally are the best bits of the film and also Margot Robbie's Jane, who is okay and delivers the story in her own style but it just doesn't work. In other Tarzan films he is the god of the jungle and is loved by all jungle creatures, unlike this he is loved by other creatures but he feels more human than legendary so Legend of Tarzan was the wrong title for this film. Also in other Tarzan films he only has to stop one villain but in this he tries to stop two villains Christoph Waltz's Leon Rom and Djimon Hounsou's Chief Mbonga who is a vicious war-lord trying to capture Tarzan and well do bad things to him. There is also no character development because it delves into the action pretty quickly so we don't learn anything about the characters unless of course you watch other Tarzan movies.The film adds some funny dialog mostly done by Samuel L. Jackson's George who is Tarzan's trusted adviser but as much as his charisma and enthusiasm changes the films atmosphere it doesn't make it better. There is one point where the action is really well done with the final act when all the animals come raiding through a town to try and stop Leon Rom, that bit is especially gorgeous because it just adds so much tension to the film but again the film fails to deliver on that action. It's a real shame because the film is exceptionally pretty with beautiful landscape but the fast paced which would be an easy distraction is just a desperate attempt to make the movie better. Even with added slow-motion moments the film is still a disastrous catastrophe and is another summer blockbuster that will be added to the film purgatory this year, to which there are many. It's not awful it's just disappointing and is not worth your investment even slightly. Verdict: Visually impressive full of fast paced action but is riveted by such a bland plot. Even Samuel L. Jackson cannot save this it will just make you want to scream Aaaahahaahhha at how bad it is.4/10 another disappointing summer blockbuster.",The Legend of Tarzan

119,doug_park2001,"""People love a good story""",8,30 August 2016,"Some of the online photo-stills make ""The Legend of Tarzan"" look pretty hokey, so I was a little hesitant about paying to sit through it in the theater. Having now taken the chance, I can happily say that this film is definitely not another feeble disappointment like 1984's ""Greystoke."" Though purists may dislike the fact that it's not directly based on any one of Burroughs's novels, there is still basic loyalty to his Tarzan mythos, and the way it incorporates some true history—King Leopold's exploitation of the Congo Free State, poaching of its game, and horrible enslavement of its natives for profit—adds a great deal of relevance for a modern audience.While it's obviously intended mainly as plain old entertainment, ""The Legend of Tarzan"" meshes humor and heartbreak very well, and the many action sequences are riveting without going too far in asking us to suspend disbelief. No, it doesn't all make perfect sense, but perfect sense can hardly be expected of a fantasy of this kind. The visuals and animation are quite arresting; most of the animals look real, the one glaring exception being the Mangani apes. But then again, this film reminds us that the Manganis are NOT gorillas or chimps. As in Burroughs, they are a separate legendary species--a missing link of some kind, perhaps? The script is generally decent even though many of the lines sound more 21st than 19th century. Good acting by all the major players, but those who play the native Africans steal the show.Some budget constraints are evident, and it's an ambitious storyline to pack into two hours: The whole pace of the film is a bit hurried. Regardless, anyone who's interested in seeing another Tarzan film in the first place should not be disappointed and may really love ""The Legend of Tarzan.""",The Legend of Tarzan

The Tarzan story has been told many times but this was a refreshing new angle. This was not the story of how Tarzan came to be but of how He went back to the land he grew up in to save the people and the animals he loved with his wife Jane at his side. When he wife is taken from him, our hero John Greystoke, with the help of George Washington Williams (Samuel L Jackson) battles through the wild Congo countryside to get her back. The bad guy is Leon Rom, wonderfully played by Christopher Waltz, who is to bad guys what Mickey is to Mouse.

121,Rendanlovell,An underwhelming turn for David Yates.,4,6 July 2016,"What we have here is yet another Tarzan adaptation. This isn't the Tarzan you know from the Disney movie. No, this time we see him start out in England as a gentleman, celebrity of sorts. People all know who he his and his origin. For a moment I thought the film would be smart enough to know that we, as an audience, also know this origin story. But this ain't that kinda movie. Outside of being a ""new"" take on the mythical man raised by apes there isn't anything remotely new about this movie. It still tells us his origin in laziest way possible and it still follows a three act structure that we have seen a couple thousand times over.As I blankly starred at the jumbled mess I was watching on screen I couldn't think of a single thing I hated, nor a single thing I loved. This is one of those movies that just kind of exists. There isn't anything that is glaringly bad about the movie at all. There aren't moments of unintentional comedy but, what's worse, is that there aren't even moments of fun to be had.The only person that seemed to be committed at all was Sam L Jackson. Who always seems to have a good time regardless of what movie he is in. Which often makes for the only bright spot in some movies, like this one. He alone makes this films dialogue sound almost good. But that is not the case with literally every other actor. All of which just seem to be playing exaggerated versions of themselves. Either exaggeratedly bored or exaggeratedly upbeat. Neither of which works for this retelling at all. This could be due to just poor directing. David Yates looked to be more interested in putting style into his picture rather than making things natural.But his ""style"" only goes as far the basic sequences of chatting. Any other time the shots are either so shaky that things are incomprehensible or the camera twists and turns so much that nausea will come to all. If there was one thing that was consistently worse than anything else in movie was the special effects.The animals and environments that utilize CG are so obnoxiously noticeable, it's sometimes painful to watch. The second biggest part of the Tarzan tale is the apes and their CG is absolutely the worst. Every time they show themselves on screen resulted in me cringing into the depths of my padded seat.At the end of day I was actually glad we didn't see the story everyone knows. If we got that movie we would've had to endure more of those dreadful apes. None of which have any personality or presence in the film at all. And, worse yet, is the characters. Who are so bland that even when they talked to each they seemed bored with the others lack luster persona. What's strange about this movie is that the majority of these negatives, are met with a near immediate positive. Some of the shot compositions are great while others are very by the numbers. Every time I find myself hating a certain thing in the movie something similar would happen but it would be done much better. This left me feeling nothing after it ended. Other than the straight awful characters there isn't anything in this movie to love or hate. As each was met by something that would negate the other.",The Legend of Tarzan
122,ginocox-206-336968,Strong performances wasted on a weak script,5,24 September 2016,"""The Legend of Tarzan"" is so invested in making various political statements that it neglects to present a compelling and interesting drama. If one were to strip away all the exposition about conservation, living in harmony with nature, conflict diamonds, ivory trade, the evils of colonialism and human slavery, the 110 minute running time might be halved. And yet, its muddled, sophomoric notions are given superficial attention without sufficient depth to make them compelling. At times the script feels like a collaboration between publicists for Greenpeace and PETA. One almost expects Tarzan to communicate with a dolphin and he actually commands several aquatic creatures at one point. Christoph Waltz delivers a compelling portrayal of an amoral henchman, but the effect is almost to whitewash Leopold II, as if his corruption and exploitation were the acts of a manipulative underling behaving autonomously, using extreme measures in a desperate attempt to save his kingdom out of a misguided sense of patriotism. Action films often seem incomplete because they have no love story integrated into the plot. TLoT has a couple of dozen love stories. Five ill-fated stories concern the death of loved ones. There are roughly as many bromances between Tarzan and Williams and various natives and various inter-species loves, including a toxic relationship between Tarzan and Akut, an anthropomorphic Mangani ape that is the antithesis of the playful companion Cheeta in the early films. Of all the love relationships, the most believable is an encounter between Tarzan and a lioness, while his relationship with Jane seems considerably less credible and less interesting. Margot Robbie is gorgeous and sexy, but their relationship seems reduced to one of raw physical attraction, although she shows herself as strong willed and capable when Tarzan isn't around.Leopold II was such a scoundrel that it seems a pity that he is only represented by a surrogate, although Waltz's performance is brilliant. The historical Leopold II enslaved the Congolese on rubber plantations and was notorious for mutilating and murdering much of the populace. Rubber is replaced in the film by diamonds, presumably because they are more visual. When Djimon Hounsou's Chief Mbonga holds out several large uncut diamonds it feels as if he somehow carried them off the set of ""Blood Diamond."" The upbeat ending belies the historical fact that Leopold II exploited the country until 1908. Things didn't get much better after that and still haven't. T.I.A. The character of Lord Greystoke seems underdeveloped. He is a viscount and a member of the House of Lords, so must have a busy schedule and important responsibilities, but he can drop everything and head off to the Congo Free State for a couple of years. It's never clear what he does in England or how he manages to handle his responsibilities with what must be limited English fluency and formal education. Performances are generally good. Alexander Skarsgård brings a brooding physicality to the role. Jackson's character seems hopelessly contrived, particularly when he manages to nearly keep pace with Tarzan running through the jungle, which would tax credulity even if the character weren't played by a sixty-seven-year-old actor. Production values are generally adequate, although the fight scenes and some of the action scenes could have been choreographed more imaginatively. The production deserved a better script with less reliance on a panoply of current hot- button ecological concerns, a more focused plot and a three-dimensional Tarzan with a multifaceted relationship with Jane and actual responsibilities in England.",The Legend of Tarzan

Alexander Skarsgard is more abs than actor as the ape man. In the end, though, it's really just some pretty pictures, and some computer- generated animals.

126,Jerghal,Poor rendition of a poorly written story,6,25 September 2016,"Why do they keep remaking this story? It's really, really not that interesting (just like Peter Pan for that matter). Okay so maybe it's not 'exactly' the same coz here Tarzan is an English Lord in the beginning of the flick and he gets convinced to go back coz evil old Belgian Leopold II might be enslaving the pour Congolese in secret. Christopher Waltz plays the same old cliché bad guy he seems to play in every other film he's done (except Inglorious Bastards - there he was REALLY good). He's the one who leading evil old Belgian Leopold II's mission in case you were wondering. So what else...oh, the CGI monkeys, well I thought Kong in King Kong of 2005 looked better. The other CGI animals (I guess VFX companies must be sick of having to produce digital zoo's) look decent enough but like I said, I've seen better (e.g. Jungle Book). The shots were Tarzan swings of the vines look rather fake and unrealistic. Same goes for other action scenes which seem cartoony and highly unlikely. As for the actors: Skarsgard was cast for his enormous ehm...closet which they pumped up some more so he looks like a 2,5 meter high stack of six packs. Sam Jakson is also present but he just chews up the scenery though I must say that it can't be easy with such lame dialogue and poor scriptwriting. So overall a rather poor rendition of an already sucked dry story.

Today's critics raze it because there is no F-bombs floating around, no nudity, no excessive blood and no cussing. It is refreshing to see an action movie that holds to the ideals of the movies of my younger years.The good: the scenery is fantastic. The jungle comes alive and it does not overshadow the film or the performances. The CGI animals look wonderful and the interactions with Tarzan are very well done. The action is filmed nicely and the film has very good action scenes without having to utilize ridiculous feats of prowess.The bad: there is not much that would be considered bad in this film. The beginning is a bit bland, but it sets up the story. The acting is not top notch, but it is sufficient to the film and to the setting. I actually thought that the film could have been longer and had more characterization in it, but that is the only negative that I had seen.I have seen so many Tarzan movies and most were complete bombs. I had expected this movie to be as bad as Greystoke, but I was pleasantly surprised.

128,swedzin,"Average, empty film.",5,19 August 2016,"This is one quite empty, uninteresting film. Honestly, I found old Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan film far more better than this. I even found Bo Derek naked breast and bottom version better and to mention that I enjoy low budget TV series ""Tarzan Epic Adventures"" with Joe Lara in title role So, what happened here? Directing and writing is just average, nothing that spectacular, intriguing, or investing in the film. It has some, decent story and development in it, but characters are just dull, one dimensional and empty. Tarzan resides in London with Jane, trying to act like nobleman John Clayton in civilized society. And that goes pretty hard for both of them. A man named Rom (Waltz) staged a trap for Tarzan to return to Africa so that Rom could bring Tarzan to a tribe to trade him for diamonds. So, Tarzan must find the way to save himself, Jane and others. The decent story, but it still has that diamond cliché crap. Let's take a look at our title character. Alexander Skarsgard is a good actor. He really is. He was chosen for the role because of his height and already athletic built. And that was OK. His acting was just uninteresting like he had something else in mind and decided to perform with only one emotion and only one tone of voice. His bright hair and tan just visually doesn't give you a real Tarzan image. Tarzan should have dark hair and distinctive dark tan. I think that director and writer didn't read Burroughs's book. Tarzan is depicted without loincloth. OK, I can live with that, but, where is the knife? The knife is something like a trademark to Tarzan. And he doesn't have it. How come? The Tarzan roar? We can hear it twice in the film, and both are the same (lazy work there), and they are definitively do not comes from Skarsgard somebody else did this roar. Guaranteed. One more thing there is a scene where Tarzan shows his hands and how big and developed they are. The thing is his hands somewhat ""mutated"" because of his raising with the apes. That was the depiction of the fastest evolution ever. And it's just ridiculous. Jane is played by Margot Robbie. Robbie was there to be something like a spokeswoman for Tarzan, just to tell the audience hos dangerous he is. She was the emptiest of them all. Yes, they wrote her strong, resourceful and that was just it. There is a scene that suggest that she should act like a damsel in distress. And she wouldn't. I think they made her like that, just not to upset feminists, or something. Samuel L. Jackson was probably the best actor here, but his talents were sabotaged by using him just to be a comic relief spewing around funny remarks about everything. That was just a waste of a good actor. Christoph Waltz plays Leon Rom, basically I think so many people noticed this, well so did I. He was definitively inspired by two Indiana Jones villains. Waltz is a good actor but his villainous character of Rom was just not that interesting. I think it's extremely important to make your main villain interesting, charismatic and likable. But Rom had none of those qualities. He has this necklace with a cross weapon which fate is pretty predictable. Djimon Hounsou plays supporting villain and the leader of leopard tribe from Opar. A good actor, visually looks menacing. But, also no charisma, or anything interesting. Costumes were good, soundtrack was solid (it has that typical intense violin, which did not change since 2005), there was some of stages built for film, which was OK. Editing and sound effects were good. Visuals of Africa were not that thrilling. And, here is the reason why. CGI. They have CGI-ed every damn animal in this film. Even the most important characters – gorillas. Why? Was it hard to find some real life gorillas? Was it hard to make a realistic gorilla costume? No matter how fake they look like, at least they are there and they are more interactive with the characters on film. CGI was not that great and it spoiled that good visuals of flora and fauna in Africa. That was just lazy. They couldn't even found any other animal for the scenes. Everything is CGI. So, that's where the all money went. On CGI, Samuel L. Jackson, Christoph Waltz and  definitively on Alexander Skarsgard's diet and workout for the film. I just can't believe it that this was the most focal point of entire filming. His hard workout and tough change of diet. They were all worried about Alex, will he be able to look like Tarzan on time? Come on, man Why not worry about developing characters, better script, better villain, better Tarzan, better acting, better development in characters and story. And less CGI. So, overall, this is one dull, empty film, it's not the worst, nor that bad it's just not that special. You can watch with the family. At least it offers a decent family fun.",The Legend of Tarzan
129,FelipeCarrillo,Tarzan Yells In Anger Through The Jungle,7,6 August 2016,"It seems that the man of the jungle will always have a place in modern film. After 104 years of to know the story created by Edgar Rice Burroughs about ""Tarzan"", David Yates (he directed the last four films of the wizard more famous of the history), Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer reinvented the classic keeping the origins intact, but transfiguring the future of the character of a form gloomy and dark; many products have been inspired in the legend but none like the of Tarzan in the 19th century.Alexander Skarsgard interprets to a different Tarzan, who poses in each frame, it gives some elegance to the film, but reduces the coarseness of the masculinity of the original, nevertheless, it is a good renovation. Jane (Margot Robbie, our intrepid Harley Quinn of ""Suicide Squad"") portrays the essence of a woman of the 19th century, refined, frank and fearful, although Robbie impregnates it a pinch of feminism, something very characteristic of our time; I can only say that Jane is not a damsel in danger, perhaps, it is she who save to Tarzan. Comical integration that can not miss is called Samuel L. Jackson, Washington Williams is the companion in the long trip to the Congo. And the best for the end, I have always been a lover of the villains of Mr. Waltz (""Spectre"") and with Captain Rom adds an interpretation a little more burlesque with trace of his previous performances, but with a new face, a spectacle in every word, in every dialogue, in every shot.With a not very frequent prologue in the current Hollywood, the film puts us in the nineteenth century, where John Clayton (name of the king of the jungle) converses with national congressmen in order to travel to Congo to prevent the extermination of a tribe very dear to him, he clearly accepts and after a short love affair, where Jane wants to go, but Tarzan refuses in order not to lose her, Jane, Tarzan and Williams initiate the perilous trip through the wet and dangerous jungles of the Congo. Hours after they settle in the tribe (with a implicit sex scene, Yes, Tarzan has needs too), they are ambushed by Waltz. Tarzan plays James Bond for a few minutes, but he is aggressively hit and remains unconscious for a few seconds, ideal period time to kidnap some members of the community and Jane - the goal was to capture Tarzan, not to Jane -. I do not why Hollywood wants to invade each story with romanticism, Tarzan and Jane have romantic potential, but no more love, it already was enough.There is a beautiful and insightful component, in addition to the chases, fights or stampedes. We have witnessed a long trip in which illustrate the beginnings of a child grown in the jungle, an expedition that goes back to 1918 with ""Tarzan of the Apes""; series, films, TV films, comedies, animations, dramas and even pornography have been based on the story. It is implausible not knowing the foundations of the guy and ""The Legend of Tarzan"" knows very well handle that past, Yates was intelligent and objective by omitting the beginnings that no one in the movie theater was willing to return to see, subtly positioned are found flashbacks that objectively elucidates the origins and they added the first moment in which the wild man met Jane. Support plots, which are accommodated with total convenience and complacency.The film respects the parameters imposed by the story, it does not require millionaire special effects nor technological artifices, however, it avails itself of both. Fidelity of a work towards to its reference is essential if you don't have a sufficiently unusual idea to eclipse the original, this time they decide to leave the past behind and projecting a Tarzan that continues with the same ideals of earlier, Jane is fresh and determined and Jackson is the humorous part, despite this, the loyalty and novelty to be injected in the film are underestimated by the somber harmony of the final result.""The Legend of Tarzan"" suffers from many shortcomings, nevertheless, it executes action scenes with total perfection. It has long I do not saw a film with so much excellence technical. The best thing the reinvention of Yates was the majesty of his scenes. Shot perfectly positioned - just in case, Were Tarantino or Spielberg involved in this? -, angles geometrically precise, focus thoroughly outstanding and a shocking visual landscape. While many of the few animals on screen are executed by CGI or animatronic, the film retains the same perplexity of ""The Jungle Book"" by Jon Favreau.Technically, one of the best movies of the 2016 and an of the more innovative and dark stories of the man of the jungle, ""The Legend of Tarzan"" is a good escapist entertainment for put a side superheros, animations or catastrophes. A professional cast, memorable action scenes and a near-perfect cinematography are intimidate by generic long scenes, clichés of the genre and a sluggish pace.",The Legend of Tarzan
130,Chalice_Of_Evil,People love a good story,7,6 July 2016,"We're first introduced to Tarzan here as John Clayton/Lord Greystoke, looking perhaps not quite like how one imagines the King of the Jungle to appear. He's been married and living with Jane for eight years in England, but clearly doesn't feel comfortable in his grand manor. He's talked into returning to the jungle by Samuel L. Jackson's George Washington Williams and Jane's eager to go with him, but he doesn't like that idea. However, she's clearly capable of standing up to him and sticks to her guns, so eventually he agrees on the condition she promises to stay close to Williams. Obviously nothing can go wrong, right? Count on Christoph Waltz's Leon Rom to mess things up for them and everyone else.Alexander Skarsgård and Margot Robbie are well-cast in their respective roles as Tarzan and Jane. Skarsgård, who I only really know from True Blood and a few movies he did (Zoolander, Melancholia and The East) not only physically embodies Tarzan, but also emotionally. At first he may appear stoic/unfeeling, but it's what's going on *underneath* that matters, and Skarsgård manages to convey a lot with just his eyes/looks that he gives and minimal dialogue. He even manages to make the 'Tarzan cry' sound really good instead of mockable. This, along with the different animal mating calls he knows (which Jane has also learned), proves important later on. Early in the film, when he's still dressed and acting 'civilized' in England, there's a moment where he makes this breathy grunt/exhale sound that you're not sure what it's about, but later you discover it's something he learned from the apes that raised him from an infant. Scenes explaining this origin tale, coupled with the first encounter he has with Jane, are told via flashbacks which are enough to fill in the gaps for anyone unaware of the story, but not too much of a retread as to bore those familiar with it. We also get to see the beginnings of Tarzan and Jane's relationship, which manages to do a *lot* with very little screen time. There's some humour to it, but most importantly you buy why they are drawn to each other.Margot Robbie proves a great choice for Jane. Yes, she's got some fight in her, she's no pushover and stands up to those who would treat her with disrespect. No, she's not some 'wannabe tough chick', she's believably strong and Robbie, like Skarsgård, embodies her character fully. Both actors make the relationship between their characters believable, with oodles of chemistry. Tarzan and Jane might not share many scenes (they're separated for a large chunk of the film in the middle), but they make the most of their time on screen together. It's important to note that Jane isn't some shrill housewife, she's a teacher and an early scene with her, her students and John/Tarzan is a great introduction to her character/the relationship she has with her husband. Thanks to Robbie's charisma, it's ensured that Jane never comes off as unlikable. Quite the contrary, actually. She conveys intelligence, heroism and sensitivity, but can also give as good as she gets when it comes to verbal sparring (especially with the hissable villain, Rom). Speaking of, the film's beginning with Waltz's character was a tad underwhelming for me, as his villains are starting to all blend together now and nothing really seems to set them apart much (nor do they live up to the one he became known for: Col. Hans Landa from Inglourious Basterds). While he does have a few good moments (a dining scene between him and Jane is quite memorable, as is her earlier insult towards his mustache), it does feel somewhat like Waltz could play this type of role in his sleep by now. He does his thing, and does it well enough, but it's possibly time he found a new shtick. Samuel L. Jackson is...well...Samuel L. Jackson, for the most part. Thankfully, he's not as abrasive as he's been in some other movies, though the film almost feels like it's more about Tarzan and George than Tarzan and Jane. Jackson does get a few good lines and provides some of the film's humour, but it does feel as though he tends to 'overtake' the movie at times, and consequently Tarzan himself feels a bit ignored. Screen time would've been better spent on the Tarzan/Jane relationship, I think (and perhaps some of the lingering shots that tended to hold for a little too long could've been reduced slightly). The other important characters in the movie are Tarzan's adoptive family: the apes. His relationship with them is almost as significant as that with the human characters. The animation, for the most part, is quite something and the CGI characters do feel like they're given appropriate depth/development. Some of the film's most emotionally impactful moments are between the different animals and Tarzan (one scene involving him reuniting with lions I found particularly effective, thanks in equal parts to the animation and Skarsgård's performance). Even more impressive is the scenery. Once the action starts, there's very few 'slow' moments (though those with short attention spans may feel different). While it might not live up to some people's expectations, those who have been heavily criticizing the film should ease up. The movie has a lot going for it (though an extended cut DVD/Blu-ray release wouldn't hurt, as it does seem as though some stuff is missing). As far as live-action Tarzan films go, this one ranks pretty highly.",The Legend of Tarzan
131,gareth-75442,Idiotic pile of garbage,3,28 June 2020,"The most amazing & unbelievable thing about this movie is that $180 million was spent using a story so awful it could only have been written by morons.
The CGI at best was amateurish throughout the entire movie with none of the apes resembling anything close to real apes & the over the top action sequences are just awful, swinging non stop on vines at blurring speeds, idiotic cartoonish fantasy.
The mighty Tarzan, played by Alexander Skarsgård who looked stoned the entire time, really poor choice of actor for this role.
Very expensive exercise in how to make cinematic garbage.
This gets 3 stars simply for the addition of Margot Robbie.",The Legend of Tarzan
132,Eddie_weinbauer,They wussified Tarzan,1,13 July 2016,"I was somewhat looking forward to seeing a live action Tarzan again,since I haven't seen one,since the ones with Casper van Diem. This one was disappointing though.In the books and comics Tarzan was not some scrawny little kid.He killed his first ape at age 13.It nearly cost him his life, but he was no pushover. I also recall him realizing he was different quite early on, and using that to his full advantage.by teasing the bigger stronger apes,And escaping up into the treetops,where the big apes couldn't go cause of their weight.In this movie none of that happens.What little back story you get is told with flashbacks, in between weak attempts to build a interesting story line,but end up totally disrupting the flow of the film. And who came up with the bright idea to cast Samuel Jackson,as an American agent against slavery? Now isn't that a reach. A few years after the civil war they have black agents working for George Washington,caring about slavery in Africa no less. Cause poor ol washington is just soo worried about slaves in other countries.The movie is suppose to take place during the build up to WWI,but there is nothing to connect it,to any events that took place during the that time period.No Radio news talking about it,nor a glimpse of a paper with references to the build up..The whole thing is very sterile. Either cause they choose to make it a kids movie.And today's kids need to be sheltered and pampered from the harsh reality.OR they just dropped the ball, during production.They also completely missed the point of why tarzan was swinging through the trees.In this movie he runs through the jungle,before he finally get forced to swing thorugh the trees. the ground would be littered with roots and dangers from predators,the trees..Not so much. The even have comics of tarzan within the movie ******spoilers******** ******Spoilers***** *****spoilers********* The Story of Tarzan,is quite simple It was about a man who grew up in the jungle among the big apes,met a dame, Jane Porter,married her,left the jungle to live in London.Hated it and went back to the jungle with Said wife. In this movie however Tarzan doesn't fight apes,he just get beaten up by them, a lot.HE doesn't ride elephants(not even CGI ones) Also quite opposite the books he's quite happy in the civilization/London. And don't mind living there. While in the books that life was very constraining to him,and he missed his freedom in the jungle.Another thing that really bothered me, was when we get to Africa he walks around in his Safari outfit. What would've been a great scene, was if the moment they came to Africa,he'd shed all his civilized clothes except for the standard loincloth,and immediately got up in the trees. But sadly her they don't even allow him that.When he finally shed some of his civilized style, he runs around in long underpants (shants). I guess Disney was afraid of parents suing, for showing a man in his underwear 30% of the movie he runs through the jungle fully clothed in silk shirt & boots without a tear.I get the impression, they couldn't decide between making him totally human(A gym ripped wussy),or sticking with the comic/book version.A Human with superhuman strength.The two fight climaxes of the movie was just really poorly choreographed,and did ERB And johnny Weissmuller's Tarzan ,no justice whatsoever ..Tarzan with a knife,can't beat a chief who throw wide swinging punches at him,like a drunk boxer The end fight was just horrible badly choreographed.The mighty tarzan get his ass kicked by a scrawny elderly white man. How on earth did this tarzan live to become a grown man,if he can't beat a old man.",The Legend of Tarzan
133,Dragonsouls,"Beautiful, spiritual movie, without the need of any philosophy or religion. Just imagery.",8,8 July 2016,"This could have been a silent film, without any dialogue in it whatsoever, and it still would've delivered on an emotional level. David Yates really knows to shoot and cut a film, and I was very moved throughout, whether it'd be from a scene of Tarzan reuniting with his furry friends, or his interactions with Jane, which I thought were really passionate. The chemistry between Skarsgaard and Robbie was excellent, and I felt like they were really this legendary couple that had been together for over a century now.Having read only the first of the Burroughs books, I was very pleased with this film. I've seen the Tarzan cartoons and loved them all, but this film really made Tarzan come off as the superhero that he is. In a sense, the very first superhero. His super-powers aren't really given to him by some freak mutation or a divine intervention. No, his powers are very human, and I wondered if the human body's senses can be heightened if one were to be born and raised in raw nature. The relationship between Tarzan and the animals is astounding to watch. And as uncanny as it seemed, I myself would like to think that is very possible. I wasn't impressed by Tarzan's physical prowess however, probably because the action scenes were badly shot. A lot of quick cuts here, no stunt doubles either. I loved the CGI shots whenever we'd see Tarzan swinging from tree to tree, but that's as amazing as things get. The real wonderment comes from Tarzan's ability to communicate with the jungle, and its inhabitants. The visuals in this film are astounding, and I was so impressed not only by the CGI but the set design too.Now a hero wouldn't amount to much if he didn't have a good villain to go toe to toe with. Christopher Waltz was excellent as ""Rom,"" a greedy man tasked with kidnapping Tarzan for a bounty. I found myself really growing a distaste for this character as the film went on, and kudos to the writers for it. I also loved the name (pronounced ""Rome"") and its clear that this was in homage to the villain's representation of modern technology, and modern government. And that's what this movie is about. A clash of two worlds. A visual take on the human inner conflict, as we balance our lives around the natural world and the man-made one.I can't say enough about this film. It's very moving and there will be tears. Happy tears more than anything. I recommend it, but not for children. The violence was high. 8 out of 10!",The Legend of Tarzan
134,coolantic,Belgian Baddies!,6,4 July 2020,"How many films feature the Belgians as villains? Exactly. Still it made a change from the usual British Empire bashing storyline.
Based on a true historical situation - the Belgians under King Leopold treated the Congo natives abominably - this slice of Tarzania has our vine-swinging hunk lured back to Africa by idealistic, and unrealistic Dr Williams (Samuel L Jackson) in order to expose the atrocities being committed there. Naturally Jane tags along so that she can get kidnapped by off-the-peg baddie Rom (Christopher Walz) whose aim is to deliver Tarzan to King Mbonga (really) in exchange for diamonds to fund a mercenary army. Along the way we get a very modern enlightened view of the natives who, amazingly, all speak perfect English and, loads of cgi animals. In particular some unpleasantly aggressive gorillas. One of whom Tarzan fights but loses to for a change in order that he can continue his quest. In fact, as is the case with this type of film nowadays, the cgi is overdone and very obvious. The vine-swinging, involving distances of hundreds of metres on one vine, is quite ridiculous. As my wife pointed out, the vines hang vertically from a branch. At most you could only swing to an adjacent tree! Tarzan's confrontation with Mbonga ends in reconciliation when Williams purges his own demons from his past as a mercenary by explaining that Rom and the Belgians will enslave them all. A mass alliance of native forces and animals results, leading to the defeat of the naughty Belgians.
You do get the feeling that this movie was put together with very little effort. Elements from Tarzan's backstory are thrown in carelessly just to remind us of his origins; how he met Jane etc. Chris Walz has a two-dimensional role and his villainy seems to rely on what other movies you have seen him in. It probably looks better on the big screen and doubtlessly the franchise will continue well beyond its 100th year.",The Legend of Tarzan
135,JaydoDre,Painfully average,5,27 April 2017,"There are arguably 2 major issues this movie has: the CG and the script. When the movie started, it opened with a gorgeous African view and I thought to myself, ""Well, even if it is not going to be good, it will at least be pretty"". Movies set in Africa automatically get extra points just because they are set in a country that is naturally beautiful and atmospheric. However, as the movie continued, almost everything except the actors was computer-generated, including things that did not need to be computer-generated, like trees, or a train. There is a scene where a man is walking his pet crocodile. They do not show the man's face so it would have been easy to hire a trainer with a real crocodile but even this croc was fake.CG is always going to be an issue when you chose to make a film with animals as active characters, but another such film, The Jungle Book, at least made sure that everything looked impeccable. The same cannot be said for Tarzan, with its fake blurry steam train looking like it came out of an Xbox game. So much CG pulls you right out of the movie.Poor CG however does not break this movie. The terrible script does. This problem can be roughly divided in 3 parts: the slow first half, the bad exposition and the poor dialogue. The first half of this film has a pacing problem, as it takes its sweet time with setting up the return of Tarzan to the jungle, suffering under the weight of the need to connect the current events to the original story of Tarzan through countless flashbacks, which brings us to the bad exposition. There is so much of it and it is so blunt. Every character's motivation is spelled out, and everything that is not talked about, gets shown in flashbacks. Can't find a clever way to explain what is happening? Just let the character describe it out loud. Film-making! And none of the dialogue is particularly good, nor does it fit well with the action, so all that extra talking really doesn't do this movie any favors. On top of that, there is a scene towards the end in which a character does something that makes no sense within the scope of this story, a final nail in the coffin for this flick.Perhaps this film could have been saved with good acting. I only watched this movie because it promised Christoph Waltz, and his performance is fine, but there is a scene in which a Belgian officer played by Simon Russell Beale talks to the character of Christoph Waltz, and the performance given by Mr. Beale is considerably more captivating than that of Waltz, and Christoph Waltz is supposed to be the main villain, for crying out loud! While this movie is not a complete wreck, it is painfully average, and in a world with so much other entertainment available, ""average"" might as well mean ""useless"".",The Legend of Tarzan
136,happy_hangman,"Not quite the King of the Swingers...but fun, anyway",5,17 October 2016,"Reboots trouble me, Unless they can improve upon or engagingly reinterpret the characters and ideas contained within the source material they are, at best, creatively worthless.David Yates 'The Legend of Tarzan' successfully reintroduces the Lord of the Apes to live-action cinema with much of his Burroughs origin and supporting cast intact...but largely eschewing the patronising racism and sexism of that author's early tales (which are fun...but replete with the ignorance and prejudice of their era). The death of Kala and our hero's relationship with Mbonga are very well handled for fanboys. The action scenes are impressive, but the CGI doesn't swamp the plot or characterisation. Alexander Skarsgård (more of a Doc Savage than a Tarzan, physically) and Margot Robbie look good together, Sam Jackson is effective as....Sam Jackson, and Christoph Waltz is delightfully vile. The plot is full of holes, but...well...that's what sequels are for.",The Legend of Tarzan

Honestly when I first heard about the film I had little interest in seeing it, but the trailer was better than I expected, and when has Christoph Waltz been anything short of terrific in every role he has played, but particularly when he is a bad guy. (Come to think of it has he ever been a good guy?) The whole cast is solid, and I really liked the historical setting concerning the Belgian King Leopold and his exploitation of the Congo. I found all the animals and the CGI to be surprisingly cheesy. Undoubtedly the weakest link in the film, but that factor did not subtract much from a constantly entertaining and solid story. Besides the cheesy CGI the rest of the film looked terrific. I would recommend to see it on the big screen. It will probably lose a lot on smaller screens.

138,lia00027,I Can Only See Skarsgard,6,11 September 2016,"This movie before when it comes on screen I already anticipated it because I am a die hard fan of Alexander Skarsgard, his acting as Eric in True Blood still mesmerized me a lot even though it's already end. Basically this movie takes Tarzan to a new level, clever plot to continue his life as a noble in England better than dwelling with his long recognizing heritage like old Tarzan movies. The flashback although quite confusing since the scenes appeared suddenly, still acceptable and make good explanations of Tarzan's life. What I cannot accept everyone else except Skarsgard and Samual L. Jackson (his banter with Tarzan really helpful to save this movie) seems unnoticed, even Margot Robbie's acting as Jane is plain and not really wining my favor her expressions and acting are not strong and could not show exact emotions of what was going on. Anyway I was watching it because Skarsgard's acting is not bad even though I was more focusing on his handsome appearance.",The Legend of Tarzan
139,n-kefala,Fun Tarzan,5,7 July 2016,"The plot of the classic adventure tale has been reconfigured and ""The Legend of Tarzan"" is unexpectedly entertaining. The story is simple enough as the Tarzan fights slave traders to rescue his kidnapped wife, in a full of special effects jungle adventure. Unfortunately David Yates with the mix between present day and flashbacks, can easily disorientate the viewer, but the fans of ""The Jungle Book"" should enjoy ""The Legend of Tarzan"". It has the same type of computer generated animals and a dark, exotic jungle that makes boys act like men. Alexander Skarsgard is uninteresting as Tarzan and altogether, ""The Legend of Tarzan""may look great and try to take itself seriously, but it's really just a popcorn movie.

140,JurijFedorov,Don't watch this there is nothing good here,4,16 September 2021,"Despite the lousy reviews I still wanted to watch it anyhow. I figured maybe people were just irritated about some stupid idea of concept I could overlook. Maybe they hated how Africans were depicted or didn't like this version of Tarzan? Unfortunately no, it's just a bad movie. It's not that it's just bad it all feels like a green screen set where not a single scene looks real or convincing. It's a bunch of shots just put together to make a movie, but it doesn't feel like a story. It feels like some actors standing in front of a giant green screen just acting to the camera. And the combination of scenes is supposed to make a story, but they remain single scenes.Tarzan himself is awfully boring. He's some sort of superhero who cannot get seriously injured or die. What he does here is stuff even Batman can't do. He is also dry and boring. Margot Robbie is god awful in this movie. This is just horrible acting. And she's a great actress so what went wrong here? I think it's the director and green screen. She just makes the movie worse. Christoph Waltz is terrible. Every single scene with him is bad. I'm not exaggerating. The acting in this movie is not acceptable.Only good thing about this movie is Samuel L. Jackson. And he's only a small part of it and not really that great either. It's just a fine role nothing more. I guess some CGI is good enough, though it does dive into terrible at times. Maybe you will like some settings? Personally I didn't. The constant flashbacks also take you out of the story. And the camera just flies all over the place. This is not Tarzan. I don't know what this is? A huge dud. It's not a horrible movie. You are never offended or mad about anything here. It's just a waste of time.",The Legend of Tarzan
141,gcsman,Maybe the best-made Tarzan movie,8,19 July 2016,"I liked this film a lot, and I think it would be possible to argue that this one is the best-made Tarzan movie. Of course it's also worth saying that the competition for that status is not all that strong. According to the pros, this is the 49th Tarzan movie (James Bond eat your heart out - ) Going all the way back to the 1930's, there was a long series of Tarzans starring Johnny Weismuller, then another series with Lex Barker, then another with Gordon Scott (a couple of which I saw as a kid and enjoyed), then Mike Henry, and then some one-offs with various other guys that didn't lead anywhere, bringing us up to today. All of them starred broad-muscled hunks with limited acting ability, and by and large the early ones were just B-movie fare churned out by the studios to keep things busy and bring in profits. Then of course there were a few attempts at TV series mostly aimed at kids and that have mostly sunk without a trace.This new one is bigger-budget and more epic in tone. The production values are great and the experience is total fun. I'd say just ignore the trolls posting negative 'reviews' on this site -- I have no idea what their problem is. I thought it got a lot of things right. The biggest of all, which is the key to everything else, is that it's set in 1890, pretty close to the era that Edgar Rice Burroughs aimed at when he was writing all the books. Attempts in previous movies to 'modernize' Tarzan by putting him and Jane in a contemporary setting have just not worked. The whole concept is historical fantasy pure and simple. It belongs just where it was in Burroughs' imagination, when Africa was still The Dark Continent to the Victorians, with mystery and menace lurking in every jungle and river. It's got loads of stunning scenery of all kinds, and it's got all the classic tropes you'd expect: great apes (mangani) and crocodiles, acrobatic swinging from impossibly long vines, a wildebeest stampede, native tribes with their own agendas, sinister Euro villains bent on callous exploitation, and most importantly an attractive (both physique and personality) Tarzan/Jane pair at the center of the story. And (bonus!) it's got a single linear storyline that's actually coherent, somewhat unlike any recent superhero movie you might think of.This time around, instead of casting a muscleman and putting up with mediocre acting, they've taken the opposite approach: hire someone who knows how to act and then get him up to standards with some bodybuilding. It's also great to see Tarzan and Jane as a couple, because this is one of the classic pairs in Western culture. Alexander Skarsgaard and Margot Robbie make an appealing pair of leads and the script is moderately even-handed about following their own parts of the story. They look good, are more than competent in their roles, and Samuel Jackson, Djimon Hounsou, and Christof Waltz are first-rate in the big supporting roles. Skarsgaard does quite an interesting job of portraying a man who literally has two people inside him all the time: he's wholeheartedly Tarzan, the creature raised by apes, but simultaneously he's wholeheartedly John Clayton, cultured Englishman and Earl of Greystoke. In one instant he can throw himself right into an all-out savage fight with a mangani, and in the next instant he's coolly analyzing what just happened and gets right back to planning ahead.Happily, Jane is a lot more than just an ornament or plot device. My wife says the right way to put it is that Jane isn't objectified -- she's a real person. In fact she might be the realest person in the story. Margot Robbie's got a marvellously expressive face and luminous eyes, and her take on the part shows a solidly independent woman who loves her husband fiercely. Skarsgaard (btw whose voice startlingly resembles his father's) as Tarzan is a gentle and considerate man, typically taciturn, but his eyes don't miss the slightest thing going on around him. And you would think that one thing a sensible villain should know is NOT to get Tarzan angry, especially by kidnapping his wife. The native Africans that Jane and John grew up with are friendly warm people, and even the one tribe that has been tricked into helping the villain (Waltz) turns out to have an interesting backstory that ties in cleverly with the main plot. Of course there are issues -- after all the whole premise of Tarzan is nonsense (but no more so than, say, Batman). It would have been nice to have more of the script devoted to character depth (Waltz's character Leon Rom, for example, obviously has pretty deep-seated problem/obsessions that are just hinted at by a few lines). But hey, this is a fantasy romance. Enjoy a well-done ride with a classic character.",The Legend of Tarzan
142,SpoilerAlertReviews,A good legend of Tarzan,8,7 July 2016,"David Yates going from TV to Harry Potter to this, which reminds me of Jackson doing Lord of The Rings and then following with King Kong rebooting a classic story. However, this is far superior to King Kong on some many levels, especially being based on Edgar Rice Burroughs' Dark Horse Comic version of Tarzan. Being set in late Victorian times, it shares some awful truth on the atrocities the Congolese people suffered under the power of King Leopold II of Belgium, which includes the millions that died and were used for slavery. Making a film like this has a high risk of seriously going over the top and must have been a challenge to balance believability and a far fetched story. I feel they succeeded in bringing a new reality to Tarzan, personifying the animals extremely well without it going too far. Seeing all these viral videos about animal and human relationships, this film does make you think if it is possible for man to be respected that much within the animal kingdom. Stellan Skarsgård must be proud of the his son Alexander, portraying the title role which happens to be Stellan's hero and the reason Alexander eagerly took the role. I believe he was ideal for Tarzan, adopting the posture, right build and the graceful movement you would expect from a tree-swinger; it can't be easy to make a hulking man of 6ft 4"" move so elegantly. I was a little worried about Samuel L. Jackson being in this movie, especially him being mostly absent from the trailers. But, he does good and the little comedy he brings isn't silly enough to stain the seriousness of the film. Christoph Waltz does what you would expect and plays the villain envoy, Leon Rom so well I actually believe he wants to be hated in real life. Margot Robbie plays Jane but not necessarily the damsel in distress some might expect. She's tough, knows her way around the jungle and is just as devoted to Tarzan's adopted family. It's a shame Djimon Hounson didn't get a bigger part, seeing what he's capable of in Blood Diamond he falls short or maybe easily overshadowed by Tarzan. The action is swift and brutal showing Tarzan's ability of being a human hero, having impressive physical strength and agility, he's the superhero without all the super, just natural, primitive aggression cased into a civilised nobleman. You're left in awe and at times you see the cast like Jackson, Waltz and Robbie looking stunned, they could almost be bloopers. Though being digitally stunning, there are some weak spots but what is breathtaking is the landscape scenery. Crews spent days filming over the Gabon National Park to capture the true beauty of the African continent and it really shows through, for which I'm glad for it not being all computer generated. There's plenty of out-of-focus close-ups during the dreamy flashbacks which add a welcome artiness to the film. It's beautifully shot and highly atmospheric especially adding the score of Harry's younger brother, Rupert Gregson-Williams which has become one of my favourite soundtracks of the year so far creating an authentic, tension-building and enchanting score. Great song from Hozier too, ""Better Love"" being the end credits track. I enjoyed this far more then expected, and I was expecting something from watching the trailers. It looks good in the trailers and it certainly entertained me. Sadly this marks Jerry Weintraub's last film being dedicated to him.

To do this Rom kidnaps Jane (a simply more than beautiful Margot Robbie) hoping to lure Tarzan. Yes, we see Tarzan run through the jungle, swing thru the trees, talk to the animals, fight the animals, fight bad guys, but more importantly we see Tarzan completely in love with Jane, his wife. Most of the movie shows Tarzan in the pursuit of rescuing Jane. Yes, this is a love story with other Tarzan antics thrown in. The chemistry between them is very convincing. (You are too easy)A somewhat annoying Samuel L. Jackson with a black wig as George Washington Williams an American who convinces Tarzan to return to Boma to show the world slavery exists there doesn't harrang as he often does in other movies, but he does try although somewhat subdued. But Jackson's lines do give credence to some humor that is appreciated in here. So there's that. The scenes that show Tarzan and Jane together are not long enough for us, but are powerful enough to keep us most aware of their love and caring for each other. This never leaves us and that is why I consider this a love story first of all. (Whaaaat? But okay, I do agree with you) Jane is not exactly a damsel in distress as we see she can hold her own especially going against Rom.What we don't see is Cheetah, the monkey we saw in many other Tarzan movies. Also we do not hear the chilling Tarzan yell, as popularized by one of the first Tarzans: Johnny Weissmulller) We hear a yell by Tarzan but even Rom when he hears it seems confused by it. We all were. It is definitely not anything resembling the Johnny Weissmuller yell.In the Tarzan story we know that Jane is an American, and Margot Robbie as Jane uses an American accent, but I really missed her natural British (Um.Australian, but she did live in England so.) accent. Notable: Jim Broadbent as the British Prime Minister. This is a terrific well-done, well-told movie whether it is considered an adventure/or a love story. (Okay, a love story) The music and acting all around is excellent and the cinematography/photography along with the CGI are simply incredible. I believe this may be a setup for a sequel. Let's hope. Although I didn't see any Oscar-worthy performances I do believe this movie may be nominated for Best Picture. Let's hope. (10/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",The Legend of Tarzan
144,destinylives52,"Not the best version, but entertaining enough",7,14 August 2016,"Far from Africa and already an adult ""civilized"" in the ways of a proper Englishman, Tarzan (played by Alexander Skarsgard) is lured back to Africa by an American played by Samuel L. Jackson (is there any movie this guy isn't in?) in order to investigate rumors of Belgians enslaving the inhabitants of The Congo. Margot Robbie, playing Tarzan's wife, comes along for the ride because she's not about to be left behind like some helpless woman — in this movie, Robbie is very much a fighter and familiar with Africa.Once in Africa, Skarsgard and Robbie are barely getting reacquainted with friends and relatives (the two-legged and four-legged variety) when a mercenary group led by Christoph Waltz kidnaps the couple. Why? Well, it turns out Waltz wants Skarsgard so he can deliver The Legend to a tribal chief who wants revenge against Skarsgard. What's the tribal chief's beef? It's revealed in one of the flashback sequences — more on this later. Why would Waltz do this for the chief? Waltz would get lots of diamonds from the chief. And what will Waltz do with the diamonds? Waltz would buy an army of 20,000 mercenaries for his king (the king of Belgium) so that the king can keep his hold on The Congo. Butthe kidnapping goes awry thanks to Jackson's help and a bunch of angry natives. Robbie gets taken though, and where she goes, Skarsgard is sure to follow. And follow he does, running into gorillas, wildebeests, Africans, Belgians, crocodiles, lions, and ostriches in order to save his wife and pretty much all of Africa.Now, with all this going on, you may be asking if Tarzan's origin story is here. Why, yes, yes it is. But not done in a good way. First, the origin story of Tarzan is told like a recap. Save for one poignant scene, the origin lacks depth and detail that fans of the Tarzan story crave. To make matters worse, the origin story is told in flashback sequences all throughout the movie. This is called non-linear storytelling; and under the guidance of a competent filmmaker, it works. Not so in this case. The transitions from one timeline to the other lacks a connection, making the jumps jarring and confusing. It ultimately leads to a movie that never finds its stride. Technically, the pacing is off. And this is the biggest problem of the movie. It's like a jigsaw puzzle: it doesn't matter how beautiful the picture of the puzzle is — if it's assembled wrong, it just doesn't work.My most memorable, movie moment of ""The Legend Of Tarzan"" is the scene when Skarsgard's gorilla ""brother"" approaches Jackson. Skarsgard tells Jackson to bow down and get into a submissive position. The gorilla stands before Jackson, and Jackson tells Skarsgard ""I'm not licking his nuts!"" ""The Legend Of Tarzan"" is entertaining enough to be worthy of your time. But for die-hard fans of the Tarzan character, I suggest you watch ""Greystoke: The Legend Of Tarzan, Lord Of The Apes,"" which I think is the best Tarzan movie ever made.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",The Legend of Tarzan
145,caseynicholson,A Strangely Told Film,5,26 July 2016,"This movie...this movie....This movie is hard to put into words. For starters, let's state some basic facts. Tarzan is one of the most popular film and media franchises in modern history, with a quick search on IMDb revealing over 200 entries for the property. However, aside from the Disney movie from the 90's and a few other animated films in recent years, this is the first live action addition to the franchise--or at least the first of any great box office success--in at least forty years. That being the case, one would think that this movie would be an origin story. And one would be wrong about that.This movie tells its story by placing Tarzan and his wife Jane in London years after they've emigrated from the jungle of the Congo. The movie unfolds as the pair go back to the jungle for a mission of sorts, and along the way the origin story is told. That being the case, effectively what develops is flashbacks of the origin story mixed into a sequel. In other words, a reboot which has no live action predecessor from within the last half a century or so starts its story far, far into the Tarzan mythology.That whole gimmick didn't work very well for me. I wanted an origin story, and I found the way that the plot unfolded to be very confusing. I've never seen the Disney Tarzan movies, or any other Tarzan movie. I know the basic gist, as most people do--a man is raised by apes and becomes Lord of the Jungle, is discovered by researchers, etc. But still--the movie should have told me that story. It didn't, really. It skimmed over it, but it didn't tell it.All that said, I found this movie to be pretty disappointing. It's relatively entertaining, and almost saves itself despite the strange plot device, but the most I can give it is 5/10 stars. Not horrible, but not the best.",The Legend of Tarzan
146,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion on This Movie.,5,17 July 2016,"Sadly only one of The Autistic Reviewers saw this movie. So only Autistic Jay will be reviewing ""The Legend of Tarzan."" The story of Tarzan has been told so many different ways...some good, some bad. This one was more on the bad side. Read to find out why: You have the cast of Alexander Skarsgård (who was a horrible Tarzan), Margot Robbie (Who was a very fake Jane), Christoph Waltz (Who is actually okay in this film, but the problem is he is really underused), and of course Samuel L. Jackson (who plays George Washington Williams...and he plays him extremely well. Probably the best actor in the entire movie.) The movie starts off with Tarzan in England...years and years after leaving the Jungle. Instead of starting from scratch...the film decides to give us flashbacks of Tarzan's childhood and his family, which would be growing up with the Gorillas. The flashbacks seemed completely off and sometimes it would hurt your eyes trying to see what was happening in the flashbacks. The green screen was so obvious and the CGI was incredibly fake. To whose who said the CGI was better in this movie than in The Jungle Book is dreaming. The Jungle Book was 100% convincing compared to this. The direction by David Yates felt very ""Harry Potter."" I just believe with the right director, the right use of CGI, the right actors and a better script this movie could've actually been really good, but it had a lot of work that needed to be done.There are entertaining scenes, don't misunderstand me, but it just wasn't good enough. I expected way more, especially for someone who grew up loving Tarzan. 5/10 2/5 stars. Autistic Jay (a member of The Autistic reviewers)",The Legend of Tarzan
147,eyeintrees,Beautiful to look at.,8,21 October 2016,"Beautiful to look at. And some amazing moments. Yes, like all these movies, a tad clichéd. However, nicely geared toward showing how exploited humans, animals and almost anything is for money... nothing's changed, and the bad days where hundreds of thousands of elephant tusks for profit, have now returned.I really liked any and all the scenes with the animals... realistically done, resonating with how much we abuse them at all levels. And speaking of the human slave trade... it was every nation, not just one, that indulged in profit from that!But at least this beautifully picturesque movie points out these issues in a realistic and relatively intelligent way.The love story... well... surprisingly good, despite the female lead being given very little of value to say, nonetheless I like this actress very much.Some faults, naturally, but a thoroughly enjoyable watch.

I was expecting a dark, cruel and gritty movie and I got something out of Disney for Kids.Tarzan for me is a wild animal, not this ""oh, I hurt my little toe now I am crying"". He was also overly adept at throwing himself out from huge cliffs into the unknown below, and such. Tarzan does not care about being politically correct. And really: Who was politically correct in the end of the 19:th century? Tarzan showed his body all the time but Jane did not show hers once. Not very fair, is it? Sadly Skarsgård was the totally wrong actor for this. They should have found someone rock hard that can kill without batting his eyes. Not this soft type who is smiling as an idiot whenever he sees a baby.",The Legend of Tarzan
149,skoyles,"Amazing, wonderful movie",10,14 October 2016,"I consider ""Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes"" one of my few favourite motion pictures. One of my few criticisms of that wonderful film is the ending wherein Tarzan returns to the rain forest leaving Jane behind. That movie was the beginning of Tarzan, his travel to Victorian England, and the impossibility of his living in that society. In this ""Greystoke"" departed from what Burroughs had written. In ""The Legend of Tarzan"" we have a riff on the first novel and of ""The Jewels of Opar"", one of Burroughs' best remembered books. Here Tarzan returns to Africa into the Congo genocide. I was pleasantly surprised that the star so resembles Lambert in ""Greystoke"" rather than a steroidal muscle man. The writing is superb and must have been extremely difficult: a late 19th century story yet addressed to a 21st century audience, with some unnecessary anti-Catholic but now fashionable material. Robbie and Jackson are standouts, even if Jackson seems sometimes a bit too 21st century. Skarsgard, however, is superb in his portrayal of a man with PTSD torn between wild and civilized, internal and external, a vulnerable Superman. I think that Edgar Rice Burroughs would be proud of this excellent Tarzan movie, a worthy successor to ""Greystoke"". A special mention must be made of the glorious music, both orchestral and vocal.",The Legend of Tarzan
150,samyoung-82648,"Expected the worst, was oh so wrong!",9,28 July 2016,"I was dubious about this movie before I went to see it. However, I was pleasantly surprised how well this movie was made.The director, David Yates (of Harry Potter fame), was exceptional in bringing out the best in the main actors. It was refreshing to see all of the main characters have a clearly defined, logical motive and no obvious reliance on Deus Ex Machina.There is a subtlety to most of the characters that was refreshing to see. Margot Robbie (Jane) proved herself without hyper violence and without bragging about intellectual achievements. Robbie's character defined herself by her actions and her conviction, superbly. Strong and supple. Christoph Walz was nasty and cunning, giving reasonable depth and credibility to the main antagonist. Skarsgard (Tarzan) wanted to be left alone, providing the audience with a reluctant hero. The director was masterful at playing the characters in tune with each other in a refreshing, seamless and meaningful way.The story certainly has fantasy elements, including jumping off cliffs and surviving. However, what stood out was that every character was believable in their behaviour and decisions. I suspect David Yates gave Margot Robbie (Jane) an opportunity to do a ""Black Widow"". Robbie, wisely, decided to stick to reality and show strength through wit and perseverance. This is something lacking in many other films: recognising that strength does not come from hyper aggression.There is good humour around Tarzan belonging in Africa more than Sam Jackson. A few of the gags were superbly executed and they came across naturally and reflective of what you would expect in real-life situations.I do hope to see more movies with characters behaving seamlessly, like this one. It's a shame that it has fared so badly at the box office. It's rare I am at odds with many reviewers, however, in this instance, I was. By constrast, I rated the movie highly, but, it absolutely deserved it. 2016 has been a great year for movies. This is no exception.",The Legend of Tarzan

Adventure is entertaining and scenery is beautiful and quite emotional too. Tarzan and animals reunion is beautiful and very emotional. Movies length feels just right for all the action. Aerial scenery from Africa is spectacle and beautiful. If you want to find something bad to say about this movie it is it's thin story and jungle scenes. Jungle just somehow don't feel very realistic, even the animals has animated greatly. Legend of Tarzan is fine salute to old classic Tarzan movies. Age of era is greatly set. Alexander Skarsgård is a good choice as Tarzan, even better than original Weissmuller was. Despite clear flaws in the story, the action, scenery and beautifully animated animals makes this movie very enjoyable. Finnkinos new SCAPE concept brings the story beautifully to screen. Picture is very sharp and 3D looks realistic. Dolby Atmos sound system brings jungles voices stunningly to audience. This movie is absolutely best to watch from big screen.",The Legend of Tarzan

Also, why are all African natives hiding in caves and dressed in war paint, and why do they all get really really close and talk really really slow and intellectual to someone? Are they really known to do this? Anyway, at the end there is a chase scene of about a gazillion million Rhinos crashing through the madman's village and destroying anything in sight, and it's like, who programming this crap? It is so fake that I was laughing. I didn't realize that Tarzan was capable of calling a crash of Rhinos on command. Cuz it's not like they're not busy hunting or something......

153,jaredpahl,"Despite Some Rough Edges, The Legend Of Tarzan Is A Pleasant Surprise... A Good Tarzan Movie",7,17 July 2016,"After decades of trying to bring a successful live-action Tarzan film to the big screen, Warner Brothers and director David Yates have come as close as anyone could have hoped for, with The Legend of Tarzan. This Tarzan has a little bit of extra fat in its script and its big scenes don't fly as high as they could, but The Legend of Tarzan is a solid, old-fashioned adventure that is sure to please those looking for an original, uncynical summer blockbuster.The Legend of Tarzan is set years after the titular jungle man has left Africa and married his one true love, Jane. Having settled into a civilized life in London, John Clayton III, played by Alexander Skarsgard, is called back to the Congo by Leon Rom, an underling of King Leopold of Belgium, played by Christoph Waltz. Rom plans to capture the man formerly known as Tarzan and turn him over to the natives in exchange for diamonds in order to alleviate the King's mounting debt. Tarzan's wife Jane, played by up and coming superstar Margot Robbie, insists on joining her husband on the trip and is soon captured by Rom, who uses her to lure Tarzan into his grasp. Tarzan and Samuel L. Jackson's Civil War veteran George Washington Williams journey across the African wilderness to save Clayton's wife and stop Rom from enslaving the natives of the Congo. Right there is a perfect Tarzan story, bringing a civilized John Clayton back to the wild to rediscover his untamed roots (which we see in a few well done flashback sequences). However, the story gets quite muddled at times, focusing too heavily on the politics of King Leopold's exploitation of the Congo. This political thread is present throughout the film's 110 minute run-time, and it often dilutes the underlying, more adventurous storyline. The story feels unnecessarily padded with politics, when a more straightforward adventure yarn would have been more appropriate.Most of the film's stars all do well in their parts. Skarsgard unfortunately isn't given much to work with in the script. He's neither the untamed wild man nor the sophisticated gentleman. His character is stuck in limbo. Skarsgard does look the part and he certainly doesn't mangle the role, but his Tarzan is unremarkable. The supporting characters fare better. Robbie, Waltz, and especially Jackson bring much needed energy to the film. Robbie's Jane is plucky without being obnoxious, Waltz is a solid, literal mustache-twirling villain, a role he can play in his sleep by now, and a surprisingly endearing Sam Jackson brings consistent comedic relief as the sidekick, George Washington Williams. Jackson and Waltz's presences elevate the movie in a big way.The biggest draw of The Legend of Tarzan, the action and special effects, don't disappoint, but don't particularly impress either. Director David Yates, of Harry Potter fame, films the action well and the effects do their job. The animals are all digital here, which is something of a shame considering that while the gorillas, lions, ostriches and more never look fake, I can't say they looked entirely real. The African landscapes are also... okay. The natural locations themselves are gorgeous, but Henry Braham's cinematography is only hit or miss when it comes to capturing that beauty. For every grand vista is a mist-filled gray mess. Still, when things work, they work well. There are moments in this movie where action, cinematography, and special effects come together beautifully and we are treated to some brilliant Tarzan moments. Any time Tarzan swings through the trees is a real treat.Tarzan has been a difficult property to adapt in modern Hollywood, but luckily The Legend of Tarzan mostly succeeds in doing so. Yes, the political plot line is too heavy a presence in the film's otherwise great story, and yes, the special effects aren't in the same league as some of Hollywood's other big budget blockbusters, but David Yates' adaptation of Edgar Rice Burrough's classic stories is far from the flop it could have been. The talented cast and sure-handed direction keep the movie afloat and allow for a good amount of thrills. The movie would have benefited greatly from some plot trimming, but The Legend of Tarzan is a solid entertainer and a refreshingly old-fashioned piece of summer fun, nonetheless.70/100",The Legend of Tarzan

But honestly, when the story moved to London, I didn't have of clue what was happening. What kind of business they had? What mission? Maybe because I was so impressed by the animated movie of Tarzan, which I've watched several times, I couldn't help myself guessing who is who when both are compared. At first I thought Samuel L. Jackson was the antagonist, the one who betrayed Jane's father in the animated movie. It turned out he's a good one. So, I got confused. The plot was a little hard to understand, for me.

155,stonedraim,Powerful in the sense of a matinée.,6,6 August 2016,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****First off; I really like and enjoy the fact that the whole production team included the writers Craig Brewer and Adam Cozad (and, of course: Edgar Rice Burroughs) has tweaked the story into a continuing saga for the ""King of the jungle Tarzan"". From the boy to a sophisticated man, and yes.... so very, very well trained (as talked and marketed about), athletic and realizing the bodicifation of ""sexy-ness""... to a social man in a relationship. There it starts and Tarzan will go back to the jungle. Interesting and appreciated. However, I doubt that the psychiatric movements and experiences had the ability in the ages this story takes place to ""recreate"" a man with speech and social behaviour as described, especially in just a couple of years.At the very beginning of this motion picture, I can feel a touch of over-explicit enhancing to the fact that they want this to be an epic adventure and movie. Just the fact that Christoph Waltz and Djimon Hounsou, two of the great actors in the movie business, confronts each other after 5 minutes says a lot. I have my strong concerns about this being a epic one or just a plain failure in trying to be one... let me now see if I stand corrected...Every time Alexander Skarsgard is speaking, I can hear his fathers voice... oh, so brightly.... Stellan Skarsgard. It seems that Stellan has been an great inspiration to his son, as I sense a lot of the personality within the characters that Alexander is portraying coming from Stellan.The visual creations and animations of the gorillas is just about approved. Sometimes the artwork is showing flaws, and then the whole magic disappears. At one point, the arms of a gorilla in only one second went from strong and thick to a little thinner one, and that in the same moment with the gorilla standing still. Watch the first chase for the boy of Tarzan, about 20 minutes into ""The Legend Of Tarzan"".George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson) is after about the half of the movie kicking things up being a solid balance of sarcasm and humour to the solemn love story from Tarzan to the jungle and Jane. I appreciate Mr. Jacksons perfect tone in his voice deliver such as ""What I wouldn't give for a horse right now...!"" and ""Zeebra, zehbra... tomato, tomaato...""One of the most sophisticated death threats I've ever heard (58 minutes and counting, of course, delivered by Mr. Waltz): ""It can also serve as an necklace...""... and a little flirtation with ""The Jungle Book"": ""Eating ants?"" ""Taste like bacon...""All the time I was watching this one, I just wondered were all the realism and authentic touch were, coming down to the blood that should have been spilled and poured out in some moments. One almost ridiculous thing were the alligators tearing a man apart... blood? No? Come on! Think ""The Legend Of Tarzan"" were wrongfully produced in that way.. and some other ways... oh, well.Can it be that the audience in the world is beginning (or already is?) to be divided into three very clear and specified groups; one of the children with animated ""cartoon movies"", one with more ""solid"" viewers claiming and anticipating very high quality and authentic realism (see movies such as Prisoners, Nightcrawler, Whiplash and such astonishing pictures) to the group of youth that X-Men : Apocalypse, Hunger Games, Divergent and films such creates. And in the last mentioned group I place ""The Legend Of Tarzan""... maybe is that group the biggest and most profitable at the moment?If you like cinematography and the feeling that youth based ""teen"" movies is providing, then check this one out. Then I highly recommend it. If you like more intense depth in an authentic way, then maybe look the other way a little bit.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : The special effects and the animated environments such as the tress in the jungle (49 minutes into the movie) is just approved. It gave me the sense of a totally animated movie, which is a whole different thing... a little bad and odd. Splendid cinematography! Great lighting, sound effects with fair work behind, very good microphone pick up in the close up shots (as when Tarzan is breathing after been tied with rope about 42 minutes into the story) and a wide perspective speaking of the soundtrack with heavy inspirations of Africa and the jungle. An orchestral open flow pushes that music further. - The actors : Christoph Waltz is good, and that man can besides that deliver so much more. In fact, I believe he wants to be pushed to the limit by the director to give an top notch performance; herein he and/or the director leans too much to his earlier success. Alexander Skarsgard is... well... approved. Samuel L. Jackson, is this really the best you can give... or was the director to lazy? - Entertainment : As the title of this review gives away; a powerful matinée of adventure... good or bad? Well.... - Age : 115,9 out of 10.",The Legend of Tarzan

Jackson is pretty much wasted, and the scene where he whines about ""what we did to those Indians"" is now fused in my brain forever. The plot was pedantic and the action scenes were generic. David Yates, the director, obviously fancies himself as the new Peter Jackson, (turning to ape stories after his fantasy franchise ended), but he doesn't have the epic yet idiosyncratic style of Jackson.

What does well does extraordinary well, it does not exagerate with unecessary super hero feel, the characters are excellent and the actual story structure is the perfect sum up of the original books feel.
I didnt even knew this movie existed until a week ago when i bought the 3d bluray and its one of the best adventure movies ive seen in a lot of years.

I enjoyed the movie a ton, however, so if you are in the mood for loads of fun, I think it would be wise to see this at the cinema. The CGI has been criticized for being cheesy, which I personally disagree with myself. I really liked the CGI of the animals, and it was good to see it on the big screen. If that was not detailed enough, well keep reading!None of the England scenes should of been removed or shortened, however, I still felt like it needed more Tarzan In The Jungle scenes. Instead of flashbacks, the movie's first seventy minutes should of been Tarzan growing up in the jungle and not just skipping straight to the main story. Then, when they finish with the seventy minutes with Tarzan growing up with the apes, they can then spend another two hours with the story of the slaves (this film's main story) with three minutes more character development and eight minutes of more Tarzan in the jungle with Samuel L. Jackson. But apart from that, this film was amazing and thrilling. Even my grandmother liked the movie when she saw it with me!

Now, having grown up demanding a more real version with live action and roles played by actors, this movie kinda meets those needs. It is a good sequel for all those who are now in their 20s. It still is a fantastical tale, and this movie takes it to another level. The use of CG in this movie is extensive and they utilized it to the fullest extent. A temporary suspension of disbelief is required, but hey. Did you really believe there was a chiseled ape man in the jungles in Africa anyway? One that looks like Alexander Skarsgård? Ha, I wish.The movie picks up a few years after Tarzan leaves the jungles with Jane Porter. He is now firmly ensconced with civilization in Europe. What I liked was as the movie progresses, we get flashbacks from when Tarzan was a baby and how his relationship with the apes is depicted. In certain scenes it is obvious that the use of a green screen is used. But to make up for those, the plus point to counter it has to be mentioned: the cinematography in this movie. It has some beautiful imagery. It has to be said that David Yates took the trouble to get the feel of the jungle correct.",The Legend of Tarzan
160,toll-8,Tarzan is wasted,5,6 November 2016,"THE LEGEND OF TARZAN: With all the superhero movies out there today it was inevitable that one of the first 'superheroes' was bound to get a remake. It is rather ironic however that it is Tarzan that fails to set any kind of benchmark and instead is one of the most generic out of the lot. The plot at its heart is a simple damsel in distress as a rehabilitated Tarzan (now John of Greystoke) returns to his animalistic ways in order to save his beloved Jane. However the narrative of this straightforward plot takes many bends in the road as we include subplots of slavery, jurisdiction, politics, and a rather odd and perverted infatuation. It is all far too much with a lot going on and nothing focused on. The characters are one dimensional with very little tension and emotion feeding through, and Tarzan's connection with the animals is either ham-fisted or unreliable. We are made to believe that he can cope in this wild and then given an on the nose flashback to just remind you of who he is. The flashbacks are unnecessary but I believe are there to pad out the story as with the lack of depth there is very little to sustain the running time, despite it being less than two hours. The cast are rather bland with Skarsgaard fighting a dull character, Samuel L Jackson being Samuel L Jackson, Margot Robbie given little to do and Christoph Waltz basically phoning it in. It isn't the worst film to hit the big screen this year but with the talent involved in it there should have been a much better film produced.

Nowadays though it's kind of offensive.The special effects were okay but that's it. Everything else is pure garbage with a special trash nod to Samuel L. Jackson who took a break from his Capital One commercials to deliver yet another Oscar winning performance. Is that dude hungry for cash or what?Jane was particularly annoying as well. She goes around getting everybody and everything killed and completely overdid the damsel in distress angle. Women must of loved her in this role.

It was only because we watched in it Gold Class, in comfortable seats and with food service, that we didn't walk out.After about fifteen minutes my partner leaned over to me and asked when anything was going to happen (in the movie that is). I couldn't help her.In fact my seat was so comfortable, and the movie so bad, that I fell asleep three times.When my partner told me she thought this was the worst movie ever, and that she was confused, I couldn't help her again - I'd been asleep.I did however witness the butterfly land on Jane's shoulder, then fly off. What a beautiful CGI scene. Totally irrelevant to the plot or story, and I'm still not sure why it was included.Then there was the scene when giant ostriches nearly trample Tarzan and his mate. At last, I thought, something is going to happen. Tarzan's mate asks Tarzan what did the Ostrich say. Tarzan replies something like - ""The Ostrich is telling you it can trample you."" And then, the Ostriches run off. That's the last we see of them. Confused? I was.The writers and director don't know whether Tarzan is Spider Man, Batman or some other action hero - but he certainly isn't Tarzan.The poor old apes get a very bad rap here. They are huge, aggressive monsters with razor sharp teeth.This movie is a showcase of when bad script writing, bad directing and masses of CGI meet.I can only recommend this film to people watching it on late night TV, when they need to be put to sleep.What would Tarzan say about this movie: AwwwwwwOaaaaaaaaWhaaaaaaOn a side note, it is interesting to see that people that rate this movie high, usually have only one review in their list - this one. This usually means that they have some connection to the film.(Edit 2 days later) I rest my case. After posting this review, 6 positive reviews have been posted after mine, all saying this is the greatest movie ever, and 4 of the reviewers have only 1 review to their name - this movie, and the other two reviewers have 2 reviews to their name.

Happy, happy, joy, joy.Christopher Waltz plays antagonist, channeling devious energies from his Nazi character from that Tarontotena (whatever) film. Waltz is great, as usual, and has fun playing villain in his white suit and comedy moustache. As a side, I've never seen anyone use a rosary to strangle a person before (but growing up I heard many-a-threat of it.)Margot Robbie, seemingly the sole focus of every advert for the upcoming Suicide Squad movie (her and her butt) plays Jane, and does a great job getting kidnapped. Samuel L. Jackson shoots guns and does not say ""mutha-f-a"" once. I think the best films are made with international teams. Sometimes the direction is a bit muddled, however. There's a distracting scene where Tarzan and Jackson are talking and the camera zooms around them in circles, and there are lots of close-up shots with the edges blurred, which are copious. But the film, as a whole, is beautiful looking.Alexander Skarsgård perfectly embodies Tarzan. From the intensity of his jungle eyes to his chicken cutlet physique, Tarzan's reborn on the big screen in spectacular fashion. Watch this film for Tarzan, the numerous, beautiful shots of the jungle, and how Tarzan interacts with the animals. Animals are interesting by themselves, but perhaps what is most interesting is observing interaction.",The Legend of Tarzan

Even for a children's movie, the script is so flawed and the physical interactions are so unbelievable that it gets annoying. It's tiresome to see all those superheroes kicked and thrown many meters away and immediately not having the tiniest scratch or broken finger, or getting shot with fire weapons (in the shoulder of course, as if it's a small thing and enough if no vital organs were wounded) and then using that arm in fight and winning. No one gets dirty or sweaty, no one stumbles, the huge jumps are simply unreal, and they all have clean hair all the time. Am I picking on unimportant things?

165,McFrogg,"He Tarzan, me sad.",5,24 April 2017,"One of my oldest memories is watching black and white Tarzan movies on TV as a three year old kid. He was my first hero.I've waited for a new live action Tarzan movie for many years, and was so excited when I finally sat in front of the big screen with my wife to watch The Legend of Tarzan. When the movie started, my heart sank. When I saw that the villain wore a Rosary around his wrist, I immediately knew where the movie was going. The villain then used it as a deadly weapon. Later, the villain reveals that he's not really religious (the filmmakers chickened out. They didn't want to make it too obvious). He explains to Jane how he got his Rosary, and then, Jane makes a comment that's not only anti-Catholic, but offensive and unfunny in general. You don't joke about disturbing stuff like that, people...interestingly, the villain was supposed to be a homosexual, but they removed the homosexual content from the movie. They probably didn't want to be seen as bigots. Oh, the irony. Even later, Tarzan and Samuel L. Jackson meets one of Tarzan's gorilla (sorry, mangani) friends. Tarzan tells him to kneel in front of the ape and perform a sexual act on it. Near the end, the villain tries to strangle Tarzan with his Rosary, and Tarzan breaks it. I really don't understand why they wanted to include disgusting stuff like that in a Tarzan movie. How does it make the movie any better? I'll admit that I haven't read all of the books by Edgar Rice Burroughs yet, but I have read a lot of comic book adaptations, listened to one of the radio shows and watched a lot of Tarzan movies since childhood, and I can't remember Tarzan joking about monkey sex. It's sad that they decided to have scenes like those in it, because the movie actually did a lot of things right. Like the earlier Tarzan movies, the action is great. I especially loved the fight scene on the train. Unlike the earlier Tarzan movies, the Africans aren't portrayed as stupid cowards, which is a good thing. There's no animal abuse in it either. The part where Tarzan meets the lions is so beautiful. The movie has a short run time compared to other action-adventure movies of today, which I found refreshing.There's a brief and non-graphic love scene in the movie that actually leads to a pregnancy! I found it hilarious that a movie with anti-Catholic jokes and imagery shows the main characters engage in non-contraceptive sex.I've seen a lot of people complain about racism is this movie. One critic even compared it to Birth of a Nation, which is insane. Like I said earlier, the Africans are portrayed as equal to white people. They complained when Tarzan movies showed blacks as inferior to whites, and rightly so, but now they whine because they're equals...must be something in their caffè lattes. To be honest, I think most of the movie critics had made up their small minds about the movie before they even saw it. ""It's Tarzan, therefore, it's racist!"".Yes, The Legend of Tarzan deserves a lot of criticism, but not for racism. Had they dropped the anti-Catholic content and disgusting humor, I would have given the movie ten stars. Hopefully, someone will make a sequel or completely new Tarzan movie in the near future without such content. A movie everyone can enjoy (except for the critics).",The Legend of Tarzan

167,feakes,Tarzan Lord of the Jungle King of the great apes is back.,10,19 February 2017,The Legend of Tarzan gets it right. I was 10 years old when I was introduced to Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan. The Series makes it clear very clear. Tarzan is a intelligent man an English Lord. A victim of a tragic event in which both of his parents died after being ship wrecked of the coast of Africa. but Little John Clayton the III was raised by Kala she of the great Apes who lost a baby. She took Little John and placed her baby in the crib. There was a bond formed. The Apes Named him Tarzan meaning pale skin. There is a scene at the start of the film where John Clayton arrives home to see Jane teaching school. She's teaching bird calls. And John imitates the calls and enchants the kids that her shows them his hands which became accustomed to walking on all fours his hands become like that of the great ape. His body has adapted to that of the apes. Such an important detail almost overlooked. Here is John Clayton entertaining school kids about his life as Tarzan. but when George Washington Williams played by Sam Jackson in a superb role. He calls him Tarzan. And he replies with My Name is NOT Tarzan I Am John Clayton the III The Earl of Greystoke. You know he doesn't want to be referred as Tarzan the subject of cheap dime novels.Very important to note.In the novels Tarzan has also struggled to maintain his name of John Clayton the III to him that name means he is a man Tarzan means he is a Beast. But as in ERB's stories John Clayton the III must always go back to the jungle to the role of Tarzan. Here the Reason is an American George Washington Williams has reports of slave trading and abuse of the natives up in the Belgium Congo. The King of Belguim has gone broke exploring the Congo basin. And for some reason there are reports of Natives going missing and slave trading and reports of mercenaries Williams appeals to the prime Minster of England and gets help from John Clayton . His wife Jane refuses to stay behind. To her Africa is home just as much as England. When they arrive in the Congo there they discover just how dire the situation has become. The King of the lost city of Opar has agreed to give diamonds to Mercenaries and the Belguim King's agent in exchange for one man the man who killed his son Tarzan. The Blood Feud increases when the Mercenaries kidnap Jane leading Tarzan and George Williams on a grand chase to the exciting and vibrant climax that simply makes you cheer.Tarzan has been many things over the years. And like Sherlock Holmes partner and friend Dr. John Watson has been dumbed down by the still popular Johnny Weismuller Tarzan films to the extant many people think all Tarzan is ME Tarzan You Jane. And that is such a dis service to the Tarzan of ERB's novels Here we see what Edgar Rice Burroughs saw in Tarzan he is a intelligent man filled with a resolve to be a good man. But when the situation calls for it he can become the beast a smart cunning animal called Tarzan.To me this film keeps the promise made years ago when Edgar Rice Burroughs first wrote Tarzan and that the first Screen Tarzan Elmo Lincoln made. That Tarzan is More then a animal. He's a man that can do extraordinary things. Things that are impossible for a a normal man.The Legend of Tarzan is by far the best adaptation of Tarzan to date.,The Legend of Tarzan
168,StregaAsuka,Tarzanless,6,4 June 2017,"Well, here we have a new Tarzan movie, and again is a sequel. We are really suffering from sequel fever lately, with so many rethought sequels from classic books (see Alice in Wonderland for example), we are getting soo used to it that it no longer excites us to what some movies. So here is the turn for Tarzan, king of the Apes, or so.The story takes place after the story we all know, which was: Tarzan is in the jungle, he meets Jane, there is some bad guy, they win, and they are happily together and go back to England. Don't worry, in this movie there are flashbacks where they explain this to you (as if you didn't know the story already). So in here they are in England and they have to go back to Congo to get some businesses done, and they get to remember who they were, and there is also a bad guy again who wants something from them, etc.The plot is weak, it we can call it a plot. The action is not in the right places and dialogues are a bit dull. of course, Margot Robbie is wonderful as always and Alexander Skarsgård is good to look at (sorry, I am a True Blood fan, sigh). And although Christoph Waltz tries to be the bad guy, he is not as good as he has us used too (please watch Inglorious Basterds). So in all, you might yawn at some point but you will keep your eyes open to see how the story ends.So, yes, this is another adventure movie which is a sequel (I have lost track of how many sequels have I already watched in 2016). One movie that will leave your mind once you step out of the cinema and will leave you wondering, ""I think I really liked the Disney one"".",The Legend of Tarzan
169,NileFortnerBoogieBuddha954,The spirit of Tarzan is alive!,7,6 July 2016,"Many people today can argue, that Tarzan is somewhat a forgotten character and property. I believe, that kids today, are not all that familiar with the character Tarzan. So it was a matter of time, that one day we would get a reboot. That kids would get schooled on Tarzan, keep it fresh for the people. I believe that this movie does a good job of keeping the character, & the legend of Tarzan fresh.In this tale of Tarzan, we don't get the wild man version at first. We get an older, more civilized, easy going man. Who has left his old lifestyle behind him. But things don't stay this way forever. Tarzan is trying to keep his cool, but Leon Rom played by Christoph Waltz (Inglourious Basterds, Django Unchained) has to go around, and mess with Tarzan's homeland. By stealing diamonds, and killing people. At first, Tarzan doesn't seem interested in helping. However, a former civil war fighter, Samuel L. Jackson (According to Ted in Ted 2. If you've seen any movie ever he's the black guy) is basically saying ""You have to save them...Motherfu#ker!""From the trailers, and T.V. spots, I was expecting the tone of Tarzan to be very dark and gritty. But, it's not that dark. In my opinion this movie has two very different tones. We have some dark and dangerous visuals of the jungle, and Samuel L. Jackson brings the comedy to this movie. Samuel L. Jackson was awesome as always. He really did a fantastic job at delivering the comedy. I literally laughed like the joker when he said ""You want me to lick his nuts too?"" (referring to the Gorillas nuts) This was okay at times, but it sort of felt like two different people directing at times.This film has some very snazzy visuals, and beautiful cinematography of the jungle. I'm not sure if they traveled to Africa to film. Nonetheless, if the didn't it is because they really didn't need to go. Everything looked very real, and it really is gorgeous scenery throughout the film.Also, the wardrobe was fantastic. Whoever did, the wardrobe, and makeup design should get some serious praise. Djimon Hounsou (Blood Diamond, Furious 7) looked like a badass, along with his tribe. Even Marvels Black Panther, would look at them like damn, you guys bad.Surprisingly, my only real complaints about the film are the performances by Christoph Waltz, and Jane, played by Margot Robbie (The Wolf of Wall Street, Suicide Squad). I believe that Margot Robbie delivered a good performance. However, the way the character was written, could have been more interesting. She could have been more of a bad-ass chick, like we all know she can be, and not be underused. Christoph Waltz as well, could have been written just a little bit better. In my opinion, he will go down in history as an actor famous playing villainous roles. However, this role, came off to me as a little cartoonish.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on the Legend of Tarzan. Superhero movies are very popular at the moment, and this movie does a good job at making Tarzan feel like a superhero. It keeps the character fresh, and interesting. Tarzan is fun for the moment, but sadly I don't think i will remember it a couple of months from now. I would love to see it again, on T.V. or streaming. That doesn't mean it is a bad film; it's just not a perfect film. It has it's moments, and I love the films message. On how know matter what you do, your past is a part of you. At the end of the day it was fun, and as Phil Collins once sang, ""You'll be in my heart"". I believe The Legend of Tarzan earns a...7/10.This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember, don't just get down, but get Boogie.

170,fluturoj,Slow,6,4 January 2017,"It felt like watching a cartoon come to live in the big screen.Real-life link: How to act to get your job done. George Washington Williams's desired outcome was to get evidence that Congo is being enslaved and save them his motive being his conscious clearness for having helped against indians. What he needed was Tarzan. The action he first did was try to convince him like the other in the room without revealing his intention. This did not work, that's why he told Tarzan his true aim for wanting to go to Africa. That worked. Plausibility: it's Tarzan. One thing however, that added to the implausibility is how lucky Williams was in landing on that train that had all the evidence. Storytelling: I felt that the movie was very strong when it came to slow motion scenes, epic moves but the action part was not equality strong. I felt the movie moved to slow and the story evolved more based on those slow motion scenes than on solid action. Slow motion scenes are appreciated after a long action scenes, they are like the pauses in a powerful speech. The one without the other just loses value. Characters: Tarzan, it was said about him that he had wildness in him, he never showed that so I never believed that for a second. Jane, little background to her story so it was not easy to understand her or to see any sort of development. George Washington Williams was the character to develop the most. He had a plan and through the film we find out his motives that make us sympathise with him. Acting:Alexander Skarsgård was a poor choice for Tarzan.

It's like this director reform our beloved classic into 180 degree, making Tarzan character with deep regression and dark haunting memories. Oh cmon, are those necessary ? It's just an illiterate work that make audience feel no empathy at all. It's so cheap, you just force it to become sentimental but the truth is you didn't have a strong reason to feel it.

Essentially there isn't really much that can be done to stop it becoming a bit far fetched and ridiculous, based on the original story. There are moments in this movie that are ridiculous and cheesy.In particular, during the ridiculous moments, there's an element of self awareness in the humor that is admirable for its honesty. This helps the movie greatly. The undertone of humor is entirely necessary for this to work. The actors do a decent enough job really but as if often the case, Christoph Waltz steals the show. His menacing portrayal gives a quality and depth to the story line that makes this story line work. He is a joy to watch. With everything taken into measured context, this is a solid and entertaining movie. I thought far better of it than I had expected to.

It seems that Hollywood has retired all of their stuntmen and put the CGI companies on retainer.The actual story was good, and seemed to follow the original book better than most Tarzan movies, and I couldn't help think how much better this flick would have been received if Tarzan was actually swinging on vines like Johnny Weissmuller did in the 40s and 50s. Yates wasn't satisfied with the fact that we have HD now, and his cinematography could win the day. He had to make 50% or more of this movie animated.It was really the lazy and expensive way out, because Yates didn't have to use any real animals, he just had someone draw them. I guess if you're a millennial, and you grew up with this cartoon world as your main source of viewing movies, you would expect no less from Yates and company to fill your screen with animation and action that is so far from reality, it looks like it was filmed on another planet.It's a stretch for me to give this 5 out of 10 stars, but the acting and story were sound, so I'll be generous.

At least there was some chemistry between Tarzan and Jane, unlike in this movie.So, where to start about what's wrong with this movie?Gorillas presented as horrible monsters with no character at all: Tarzan grew up with them and here they all look the same and behave the same.Incohesive boring dull plot and style of movie: The movie is mostly serious and takes place at the end of the 19th century, but here we are listening to a blowjob joke with Samuel L. Jackson?! I was just waiting for him to say something like ""I'm gonna kill these motherf***ers, bi***"".Alexander was playing a bulked up version of vampire Eric with Supeman strength, except in the final scene, where he would almost get strangled by a tiny necklace, because the plot needed it to be like that. Come on, who has the time to think of a better or more realistic way to kill Tarzan?Samuel is playing the same role as always- a slightly comical badass. His role in this movie seems just odd.Even though Tarzan has been living in England for 7 years, with no real jungle or playground to work out, he still looks bulked and he's still as agile and strong as he would have been, if he have never left the jungleThe train scene was just ridiculous: First the never ending vines and then Alexander beats up about 30 people within seconds. It was like I was watching the Terminator or some cheesy karate movie, where guy beats a whole army.Most parts of the movie were just for show- either action scenes or six packs or gorillas pounding their chest, because you know- gorillas have to do it before every single move they make. Why would you make a movie with interesting characters or a real plot, if you can spend your money on explosion and fake vines, that look fake?The whole diamond story is shallow, uninteresting and badly developed. Maybe it had some potential, but the writers weren't capable to pull it off.There just had to be an explosion scene, because Hollywood. That is so unbelievably lame, that I can't even describe it.One positive thing: In the scene with the running bisons (or whatever they're called) I was expecting a remake of the Lion King scene, that we also saw recently in the Jungle Book remake (that is almost as bad as this remake), but they didn't copy the same scene.

182,CinePendejo,Good intentions sometimes bites itself in its own ass,4,4 July 2016,"UGH! Not one of these againOkay, look. If you're attempting to remake a more faithful Tarzan movie – notwithstanding the VAST abundance of other Tarzan movies – you better go all out with it. The original stories by Edgar Rice Burroughs may hold a huge influence of decades-old adventure stories, but one cannot help to notice its largely uncomfortable racial issues, especially in an age where our literary society grows more sensitive by the day. I mean if you think about it, it's inescapable: A white hero representing a total embodiment of powerful, Anglo-Saxon race fighting unusual enemies in uncharted territory. Yeah, I'm sure THAT won't turn some heads, to say nothing of the unpleasant Colonizing that came with it. Yikes! But what made these stories hold their lasting weight lies in their fun, pulpy adventure style in wacky scenarios. So call it compensation: ""Sure this sounds racist, but it's also about a guy fighting bad guys with his Jungle friends, and that's awesome enough!""So with that in mind, there are angles to get around this for a modern update on Tarzan. On my money, the best angle is the 1999 Disney version, where they keep the action and the human races simplified in order to develop a man-vs-nature story that actually develops the hero as a character. The other movies went for broke and just became silly action adventure romps. The Legend of Tarzan, on the other hand, decides to take this subtext into the main thrust of the movie, whereas Tarzan is tasked with stopping Colonialism in Africa. Sadly, since the Warner Bros company clearly comforts itself with the gritty reboot template, any speck of goodwill from this otherwise exciting premise gets sucked out in an utterly dull, bloated, occasionally phony, carcass of a movie. The story takes place after the whole shenanigans in the Jungle and Tarzan has made a name for himself in Britain where he takes a new persona as John Clayton. After a meeting with George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson), he persuades the former ape-man to aid him in his efforts to abolish King Leopold's slave efforts in the Belgian Congo. Little did they know that he and Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) are in cahoots with each other in an uninteresting villain plot with diamonds and mines. Jane (Margot Robbie) eventually tags along because she misses her homeland and the movie really needs a good excuse to get captured for a third-act rescue. So yeah, it's up to Tarzan and his reunited animal buddies to take down the interlopers, rescue Jane, and despite trying their best to reduce the materials racism, inexplicably take credit from Williams in abolishing black oppression in Africa. Really.Apart from being overstuffed yet simplistic, the biggest problem with the movie lies on how much it blunders on its own intentions. The film constantly emphasizes the horror of colonizing Africa at this time period for little reason other than to address the race issue, yet couldn't find ways to go further with it other than a ""great white savior"" story. Whether or not they couldn't conjure another angle with the whole ""Belgian Slavery but with Tarzan"" or they just thought we would think it's noble, but the result ultimately makes him the hero while Samuel Jackson's character gets stuck as a wacky sidekick. It's like trying to fix a wine-stained tuxedo with splashing more wine onto it. Outside of this irony, the rest of the film befalls into boring and half-baked. The writing consists of lazy exposition and awkward comedy, the characters are paper-thin, and the few CGI action scenes – save for a third act animal stampede – lack so much punch and scope it's borderline bizarre. I know Warner Bros hired director David Yates to helm this because he banked a lot of money with the gloomier Harry Potter movies, but most of his blockbuster panache and overall dreary aesthetic falls limp here. (Or maybe he's saving his energy for Fantastic Beasts) Most of the performances are all wasted but try to bring charisma, save for Skarsgard who couldn't even hold the medal in appeal against Jai Courtney. Most damming, the movie tries to fill up Tarzans origin story via flashbacks, which serves little more than rush the character development and set up one needless plot points after another. Admittedly, the movie brings itself up a few notches during the aforementioned third act stampede. It all looks straight out of a pulp adventure romp detached from the rest of the movie, but rarely does a film benefit from that. I mean, why can't a Tarzan movie stop refrain from gloomy pretense for once and actually becomes a Tarzan movie?However, in the end, this movie left me conflicted on who this movie is for. It fails to be a historical piece by adding fictional ape brawling. It fails at being aimed for old Tarzan fans by its ""gritty reboot"" style and the fans of said style would get zoned out by the rest of the tedium. Most damning, though, the movie admirably faces the racial implications but winds up biting its own ass. Credit is due for intentions despite the fact, but sometimes that just isn't enough.To check out my other posts, check out my blog! http://itachisan125.blogspot.com/2016/07/review-legend-of-tarzan.html",The Legend of Tarzan
183,mrinalmmehta,My Review!,7,29 August 2019,"I wished this movie wasn't about his Legend. It focussed so much on John Greystoke that ""The Legend"" just dropped here and there. No doubt this is a new take on Tarzan's story, but something was just missing. I wished it was more like The Jungle Book. Focussing more on the main character. This would've brought back tons of nostalgic moments. For the fans of Tarzan, do watch. :)Peace Out!",The Legend of Tarzan

First of all its so different from all others Tarzan Movies and that's what makes it exceptional and best one in my opinion. From start to the end its enjoyable and this felt like watching a typical Good Hollywood Movie.I really thought from the trailer that this is gonna suck but too my much surprise it won my heart and others too.All the main cast is stellar and my God all the scenes filmed in the Forest are the highlight. Growing up watching Tarzan this Movie is one of the best of This Year for me. That's what I expected from David Yates after making great multiple Harry Potter Movies.,The Legend of Tarzan

Or Lex Barker?,3,21 October 2017,"When they were building up Alexander Skarsgard's six pack for this film, director David Yates should have spent some time building him a personality, too. Skarsgard's Tarzan is a blankfaced, lank haired cypher--who loses most of his fights. Sadly, Skarsgard's dreary personality matches the film's. It's a long, slow exercise in tedium. The CGI vine swinging is nearly as cartoonish as the Spider Man movies. Christopher Waltz and Samuel L. Jackson drop in their usual, never-changing, tiresome schtick. Jackson, in particular, needs to go back to acting school to work on his craft. Margot Robbie is particularly mistreated. One of the most beautiful and stylish actresses currently working,Robbie is saddled with a generic American accent and spends most of the film damp and bedraggled. While not the travesty that Bo Derek's Tarzan the Ape Man was, it's still a waste of time.",The Legend of Tarzan

Now let's see, we have a bunch of armed soldiers on a train (and no pistols), and the natives just over come them all. And the leader of the soldiers comes in. Does he draw his weapon? Nope, and Tarzan sends him packing.And then we have 1000 more soldiers camped out. With a Maxim machine gun. And the animals and natives over run them in about.... oh... two- three minutes.In the original Tarzan, both sides take losses.Even the 'catch up to the train using a shortcut' had no excitement.Redbox was only two bucks, and thankfully I could fast forward it.And the CGI animals..... spare me.

187,anthonymichaelbangert,A Legendary Take on Tarzan,9,9 July 2016,"The Legend of Tarzan is directed by David Yates, who many people know as the director of the best Harry Potter films. It is a more adult take on the story of the king of the jungle. In this film, Tarzan, who goes by John (Alexander Skarsgård) , has already been domesticated and has taken his royal place in Britain in the late 19th century. When George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson), a gunslinger and civil war veteran comes to ask Tarzan for help because of a slavery problem that may be happening in the Congo over some diamonds, Tarzan must go back. Jane (Margot Robbie) comes along but she, along with some African people she calls family, is kidnapped by Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz). Now Tarzan must reconnect with his jungle roots in order to save his wife, and the Congo itself. This movie is really great. It's fun and exciting, and an interesting take on Tarzan's story. It was a risky move to not do the story of his origin (except through a few flashbacks), but rather tell a new story. It was almost like starting with a sequel. But it pays off really well. We understand who the character is and why he is the way he is, and that's enough. The acting is decent. Nothing spectacular. Samuel L. Jackson is a great comedic relief character and Christoph Waltz plays the same villain he's played in many movies before. Margot Robbie was an American Jane with a lot of moxie. It's always refreshing when a woman is not just in a movie top be a damsel in distress. And Alexander Skarsgård is the perfect Tarzan. He plays the sophisticated British and animalistic sides both pretty well. The direction of this movie is great as well. David Yates really has done such a great job. The CGI in this movie is pretty great as well. For the most part the animals ate pretty fantastic, though there are moments where they could be better done. All in all, I loved this film. I'd give it a 9.",The Legend of Tarzan
188,andrew_james10,I wasn't expecting that,9,31 December 2018,Never one to watch predictable storylines and holes in the plot to rival Swiss cheese but this was far better than most. CGI Apes are a long way from being perfected but these weren't terrible and the rest were pretty good. So hats off to the acting and story based on the true history of the end of the 19th century. The scenery and camerawork is outstanding and if you want 90 minutes of entertainment I highly recommend this movie.,The Legend of Tarzan

This show was very bland and NOT Tarzan
Just a very weak version of him
I mean a man that swings through the trees walking with all his clothes on instead of rushing post haste to save his wife
Uh uh
That does not jell
The only reason why I gave it a four and not lower is the make up and special effects were not that bad
He was a reasonable Tarzan when he became Tarzan but sad to say GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE was a better interpretation of Tarzan

Sorry but this movie joins my sell collection post haste

In my opinion, i'm sick of Dracula, werewolf, horror/adventure genre movies. Was I thinking pessimistically? Well, as it turned out, it was enjoyable. Nothing incredible really, but the action was impressive. Special kudos to the visual effects gurus, the CGI gorillas were brilliant. Harry Potter director David Yates knows how to put action scenes together well. Story-wise it felt a bit cluttered, do we need a slavery in the Congo subplot? The lead actor playing Tarzan was surprisingly good. Strider from Lord of the Rings meets Alan Quatermain. Samuel L. Jackson clearly wandered off the set of The Hateful Eight and kept playing a watered down version of his battle-hardened Civil War veteran. I walked out of the cinema feeling impressed.

I read about the diet / exercise plan he was on for this film - check that out!Samuel Jackson, as usual, was exceptional. Christoph Waltz played his usual bad guy, and even the amazing Djimon Hounsou made the best of a small part.So, see the film for the expansion of the Tarzan story to include the history of the era, the beautiful costumes, wonderful acting and some truly amazing scenes.",The Legend of Tarzan

He has an American wife named.......yeah, we know.....Jane. He is recruited by Samuel L. Jackson to go to the Congo to figure out how King Leopold of Belgium is financing his expansion there. Christoph Waltz is the evil Belgian in charge of getting blood diamonds to pay for all the shenanigans. Tarzan and Waltz collide. Gorillas get hurt. Tarzan has flash backs. WARNING!!!!! Tarzan and Jane survive. Bad guys get it courtesy of Tarzan's animal family and buddies. Questions that aren't answered: Why is Tarzan so disinterested? He seems blasé most of the time. He has less connection with the audience than Rex Herrison in Dr. Doolittle. Why is Jackson in the movie? If it is for comic relief, it fails. If it is for drama, it fails. If it is for PC bullshit about PTSD and Indians.....there it is. If you have seen one Jackson movie, you've seen them all.....he is an angry man with a chip on his shoulder.Why is Jane there? Jane is hot but there is zero nakedness. I didn't even see her calves. No sex. No acting evident either. Why is a pretty good Waltz there? He is single-dimensional.Why are all the Belgians carrying Swiss Schmidt-Rubins of a model make after the setting of the movie? Must have gotten a deal from surplus dealer SAMCO. Why is the CGI so unconvincing? Apparently all the good CGI people were tied up doing The Jungle Book and this movie got the B Team. Why is Tarzan in the movie? Oh, he's the dude playing a dude who can act. It fails. He can't act. What is the most disturbing aspect of the movie? The preview for Ghostbusters.

195,blazedounal,Different tazan story but interesting,8,15 August 2016,"""The Legend of Tarzan"" is joyous. The Legend of Tarzan was really fun to watch. Much more fun than the marketing made it look. More and more lately I am discovering disconnect between myself and the vast majority of movie critics. I have loved a lot of movies this year that they've hated, and that trend continues here with The Legend of Tarzan. The Legend of Tarzan is unique in that it's not an origin story. I like this movie but Is the movie perfect? Probably not, but it comes so damn close that I don't care.As a result of the Berlin Conference, the Congo is divided up between Belgium and the United Kingdom. The Belgian government is on the verge of bankruptcy, having gone into heavy debt to build a national railway and other infrastructure. In response, King Leopold II of the Belgians decides to extract the Congo's rich mineral deposits, sending his envoy Léon Rom(Christoph Waltz) to secure the fabled diamonds of Opar. Rom's expedition is ambushed and massacred, with only Rom surviving. A tribal leader, Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou), offers him the diamonds in exchange for an old enemy: Tarzan. In London, the man once called ""Tarzan"", now called John Clayton III, Lord Greystoke inherited from his father. George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson), who recognises John from the stories of ""Tarzan"", privately reveals to John, Lord Greystoke, that he suspects the Belgians are enslaving the Congolese population, and persuades him to go to Africa in order to prove his suspicions. Later, Jane, Tarzan and George Washington Williams come to Africa to inspect Belgian government. Tarzan, Jane and Williams take their trip to the Congo. There, the trio encounters a tribal village that knew Tarzan and Jane during their stay in the jungle. That night, as the tribe sleeps, Rom and his mercenaries attack the village and kidnap Tarzan and Jane and kill the tribe's leader. They then escape to a nearby steamboat with Jane and several of the tribe's members, but Williams is able to rescue Tarzan. With the aid of the tribe's warriors, Tarzan and Williams intercept a Belgian military train carrying captured slaves, providing Williams with the evidence he needs to expose King Leopold who enslave Congo people. They also discover that Rom intends to use the diamonds to pay for a massive army to subdue the Congo, and allow Belgium to mine its wealth for Leopold's benefit. As Tarzan and Williams continue onward, Tarzan encounters the adult Akut, who is now leader of the apes. Aware that Akut considers him a deserter, Tarzan challenges him to a fight and loses. That night, as Tarzan recovers and they continue to recues Jane from Rom and his mercenaries. On Rom's steamboat, Jane dines with Rom, before escaping and swimming to shore. Jane stumbles into an ape nest, Rom and his mercenaries killed many ape to take Jane out. Tarzan saves the remaining apes, reconciling with Akut, before pursuing Rom. He is cornered by Mbonga and his tribe, where it is revealed that Tarzan once killed Mbonga's only son for previously murdering Kala. A defeated Mbonga tearfully accuses Tarzan of lacking honour, as his son was just a young boy when Tarzan killed him. Tarzan spares Mbonga, just as Akut and the apes arrive to subdue the tribe. Rom takes Jane and the diamonds to Boma, where he plans to take control of the army. Tarzan, Williams and Akut trigger a massive stampede of wildebeest through Boma, destroying the town and distracting the soldiers, allowing Tarzan to rescue Jane. As Rom attempts to escape by boat, Williams sinks it with a machine gun as Tarzan swims aboard. Rom tries to kill Tarzan, before Tarzan throws Rom into the water, where he is devoured by crocodiles. Williams returns to England and presents the Prime Minister with evidence exposing the slave trade in the African Congo. One year later, Tarzan and Jane, having remained in Africa and settled in Jane's father's old house, welcome their first child, as Tarzan, Lord Greystoke, returns to his rightful place among the great apes as Tarzan.",The Legend of Tarzan
196,thechair,Ahhhh-ah-ah-ah-ahhhhh-ah-ah-ah...Oh.,4,9 July 2016,"He's back! Tarzan is back! I loved Tarzan movies as a kid. Ron Ely or Mike Henry's 1960s versions were those most plastered across the TV during my school holiday mornings, or sometimes at 6pm on BBC2 (bring back that slot, Auntie Beeb!). I liked the oldies with Johnny Weissmuller, too. Classics. So, even though the trailer induced a worrying indifference in me, I was optimistic about The Legend of Tarzan (2016; 110 mins). It was an optimism shattered early on: this is virtually the least fun you can have at the cinema this summer. For one, it is overly earnest, and this is exemplified in Alexander Skarsgard's solemn turn as the ape man. He's awful, exhibiting all the charisma of a breeze block and little attempt has been made to do anything with the character. Simply blaring Rupert Gregson Williams' unsubtle score over his every movement does nothing to hide that. For two, almost everyone on show is completely one-dimensional. It's a reasonable shorthand, depicting the Belgian colonisers as evil and the Africans as noble, and if the film was outrageous fun I would have revelled in such a split, but it isn't and the archetypes bore, the simplistic presentation of Dick Dastardlies (chiefly Christoph Waltz) vs brave warriors (Djimon Hounsou & co) or loving families leaving me wanting for human complication and wondering if this treatment wasn't, you know, a bit racist? There is perhaps a flash of depth in Samuel L Jackson's true-life historical figure George Washington Williams. At one point he relates to Tarzan that he was not always a good man. It's a moderately decent scene within a short patch where the film has some personality, but it illustrates its deep problems when the most intriguing character is a regretful soldier AND NOT the English Lord who can communicate with animals having been raised by apes! Jesus. Margot Robbie's Jane is okay but as with everyone else around she feels very much like a 21st Century notion plopped into a 19th Century costume. There is little about this world that feels like 1884.Normally I would hope that the technical merits of a big-budget film would help it out but they, too, are lacking. The CG animals are okay; reunions with elephants and lions (both scenes typically po-faced) impress but the effects are off the pace of the Apes films or The Jungle Book. Director David Yates brings with him the cold visual sheen he used so effectively in his Harry Potter films, but here it merely dulls the wonders of an amazing continent. There are fabulous, verdant greens in jungles, and the savanna David Attenborough has sold to me glows gold enough to make a man cry at evening times. None of this is to be seen in this matt-painted land. Just as it doesn't feel like 1884, neither does this feel like Africa (I should point out here that I've been to neither). The editing, too, is second-rate, certain sequences and action scenes making little sense in places. And where was Cheetah! None of my gripes would matter if there was any enjoyment in watching Tarzan's new legend but the dreary sincerity means they all hammered home. I'd rather watch Congo again, and that's rubbish.",The Legend of Tarzan

The teams of him losing his child and Wendy(give or take)her also losing her child is very well done in drama",The Legend of Tarzan
198,modernmonstersdotnet,Saga Africa,5,23 September 2016,"This summer's best superhero movie this side of Deadpool, The Legend of Tarzan (hereafter: Tarzan) carries on the torch of a legend in the first of the only two ways possible: dead-on seriousness or camp revisiting. Not that camp doesn't work, mind you, but the writers of the movie have a collective brain severely missing from our other movie of the week, Suicide Squad, and are therefore able to choose their side instead of desperately aiming at the middle of the road. Yes, Tarzan aspires to tragedy, an ambition somehow undermined by the fact that its villain is King Leopold II of Belgium, an unlikely foe if there was ever one, but it takes these aspirations seriously and delivers the goods in a dreamy, campy, obsolete way. It's a superhero movie with a conscience, albeit an easy one, it being Mother Nature herself. But she takes a dire toll on who's going against Her.So. starting like King Kong with Congolese ninjas making a fool of the Belgian army, Tarzan establishes Djimon Honsoon as the Leppard King who holds a grudge again Tarzan, and that way an unholy alliance is forged with evil Christopher Waltz (when will he stop to cash it in as a Raider of the Lost Ark evil nazi?), since King Leopold II's coffers are empty and he needs the Opar diamonds the Leppard tribe happenstance to detain. The fact that the tribe is readily letting go of a immense treasure to allow the tribe chief to revenge his son before most certainly being either massacred or enslaved is glossed over with the help of some noble words and the fact that Djimon Honsoun looks fantastic in leopard skin and a loin cloth.Tarzan is bored in England, desultorily visiting the Prime Minister in the company of his black sidekick (Samuel L. Jackson, who else?). Better get used to Tarzan getting bored, or looking mildly annoyed: those are the two expressions Alexander Skargaard allows his character to sport, letting his spectacular eight-pack do the acting. One would be forgiven to muse on the fact that Lord Greystoke being some kind of a UN ambassador and a diplomatic/black ops weapon of sorts, his stomach muscles shouldn't be his only set of skills, but the movie, in the best tradition of the action genre, recognise that with great abs come great responsibilities, so Tarzan is back to the jungle to fight the Belgian colonial Empire, slavery and the cowardly assassination of African fauna. And he brings Jane along, since she's pregnant and a strong spirit.The jungle, see, ""consumes everything but never the strong"", or, in that particular instance, the well connected. Tarzan and Jane are on their best William & Kate behaviour when back to Congo, copious flashbacks exposing their back story, sniffing meet-cute included, and his dysfunctional relationship with his Mangani brother (""Mangani"" being the 21st politically correct for ""ape"" or ""gorilla""). It becomes pretty obvious on the course of the movie than Tarzan is quite lousy at fighting, since he loses against lost tribes, gorillas, and even Belgians. But the thing with Tarzan is he has powerful friends, as demonstrated in the final showdown which is all that one wanna see is such an adventure flick: a tea party interrupted by herds of gnous, an elephant stampede and some African finest including lions and crocodiles. For the effectiveness and the elegance of this scene alone, the movie is worth seeing: man is hopeless and not to be trusted, it's Nature who saves the day rebelling, a lesson learned through hardship and repeated abuse.Tarzan, as the title indicates, is a legend, an abstraction, an article of faith. Far from defeating the evil Belgian regime he acts as a catalyst from a rejection deep rooted in abuse, crime and callousness. The movie manages not to trip on itself denouncing the exploitation of the Mother Continent by greedy foreign powers, and he does so using the traditional elements of this kind of epic quest: there is a boat and a train that have to be stopped along highlights of the Gabonese rain forest (standing for Congo). There is a ""civilised"" diner scene establishing the power dynamics between the bad guy and the kind woman, each standing for conflicting ideals. There is a Houdini number, group jumps into the abyss, and a bondage party turned genocide. All that and more. One suspects that should one have seen this movie at 10 years old, it would have become an instant favourite; quite some years down the line, it nevertheless looks great and feels decent, two crucial qualities that most recent super hero train wrecks would be unable to reclaim for themselves.

199,paul_tremblay,Surprising negative reviews...,8,15 October 2016,"I usually do not give much credence to reviews; the aggregators (Rottentomatoes.com, Metacritic.com, etc.), yes, maybe, as if a number of them do agree on something, perhaps there is something there. But...I am surprised at the number of negative reviews and opinions on The Legend of Tarzan, puzzled at the below average score in Metacritic and Rottentomatoes.The very structure of the movie (flashbacks, etc) makes it an stunning piece of work, a very difficult tour de force to accomplish. It could have been an obtuse film but packs a lot into a couple of hours.I could go on to say just as amazed I am to see that films like The Force Awakens and Elysium garner so much positive feedback (OK, that's my opinion: they are overrated, how many enemies did I just make here...) but not this. The visual and audio twists between past and present, between the different settings is handled and controlled extremely well by Yates and his editors and, as I said, what could have been a bundle of disparate and confusing scenes ended up being an compacted work of entertainment (and maybe even art). Yes, some of the plot ""twist"" were predictable, like (Spoiler!) Rom's orchestration of John's visit, but nothing really is lost on this. Yes, Tarzan should have shown signs of some facial hair the first time Jane met him (his mom shaved him...?) but I have seen much worse.Of course another thing, kind of major: this movie is another sad instance of the portrayal of a White Savior (a white guy, usually but not always, look at the Blind Side) being stronger, smarter and, well, saving the poor black people. One of the top box office successes of the last decade is Avatar (yes, Blue People, but you get the point).Is the second to last scene (tribe people cheering) cheeky and tacky? You bet. But I would then repeat my prior claim and/or question: why the bad reviews when Blind Side, Avatar and other such narrative garnered reviewers' laurels? I would counter that Tarzan is, at least, technically superior.OK, not everyone's cup of tea, but I recommend.",The Legend of Tarzan

None of those old ""Me Tarzan,you Jane"" scenes likely considered hokey by today's standards.

Samuel Jackson as real-life historical figure, Dr George Washington Williams draws them back to Africa on a quest to save the Congo by exposing the crimes of King Leopold II of Belgium.

201,omega_work,Did not capture what I loved about Tarzan,4,12 November 2016,"As a kid I loved Tarzan - but I have yet to see a film or show that captures what I loved about it. Greystoke was too gritty and as a kid I found it boring, The Lost City felt like a made-for-TV special, the Disney one at least had heart but was too childish for my taste. Now we have this one...To be honest I can't think of much I liked about it. The flashback scenes felt forced and usually irrelevant. One of the flashbacks featured Tarzan's first encounter with Jane - he is naked and his hair is unkempt... but he's clean shaven?! That scene is a perfect metaphor for this film - it destroys the suspension of disbelief in needless ways.Margot Robbie - who kicked ass as Harley Quinn - was now a helpless damsel in distress coming along for the ride. The whole plot of the villains was a bit too complicated and poorly explained to be enjoyable. It's as if they mistook mystery for confusion.The effects were pretty bad by today's standards as well which I could live with if everything else was acceptable.The bottom line is that the film really didn't capture any of what I loved about Tarzan as a child and at the same time missed the mark on everything I enjoy about films in general.",The Legend of Tarzan

203,Scott699,Closer to the book version of Tarzan than the Weissmuller embarrassment.,8,6 January 2021,"As a kid I had seen a few Tarzan movies on TV, and then when I was 11 my aunt gave me her five copies of the original Tarzan novels, Which I still have. After reading the first one, Tarzan of the apes, I could no longer watch a Johnny Weissmuller movie, they took an amazing character and turned him into just sort of special needs. Tarzan of the books never talked like JW, he spoke several languages, he never lived in a treehouse, there was no chimp name cheetah nor a kid name boy. That said, this version of the movie is very close to the Tarzan of the books. Greystoke, the legend of Tarzan is a great version of the 1st part of the story. In the books he grows up in the African jungle with apes, he becomes lord of his tribe of apes, meets Jane Porter, helps her get rescued, but he stays in Africa never having talked to her, then he saves Frenchman named Paul d'Arnot and the frenchman teaches him English and French, Tarzan helps him get out of the jungle and they make their way back to England. Tarzan, John Clayton, assumes his role as lord Greystoke. He then traveled to America to find Jane. After a few years he returns to Africa, eventually builds a ranch and him and Jane marry, have a son named Jack, and they live in Africa most of the rest of their lives, With the exception of the many adventures that take Tarzan away from his ranch. This story is similar to many of the books, with the exception of Tarzan never lets a bad guy live. And he usually has his fathers knife with him which he uses quite often. If you're a fan of the books you will love this movie, if you're a fan of that dreadful Disney cartoon or the Johnny Weissmuller movies then of course you will hate this one.",The Legend of Tarzan

Instead of playing on just action scenes, this movie played on the quality of the people and their stories. The suspense crescendoed very nicely - and the climax was good edge-of-the-seat stuff. Alexander Skarsgård did an excellent and believable job of playing Tarzan. Samuel Jackson was a good contrast of humor and edgy wild-west America - a nice change from his usual roles. The whole message about man and nature and fact that the animal world is so much more than a bunch of ""stupid animals"" was beautifully done. The panoramic scenery of the country and the wild-ride and explosive action scenes were gripping. Overall - this movie hit it right on the head. I'm sure that Skarsgård's abs hit it big with the ladies - but personally, I was impressed with his ability to downplay the character and maintain a sense of humble humility throughout the story. Definitely recommend this film.",The Legend of Tarzan
205,AhmedDaReviewer,Really wanted to like it but..,2,24 September 2021,"Wow, This movie was such a chore to sit through, When it comes to these Disney live action remakes, I don't really expect a lot from them, I just go in with an open mind and see it for what it is but dude, This movie gotta be one of the most unoriginal, boring, one dimensional movies I've ever seen, It's not even funny, It's just sad..Tries to do so much stuff with the characters and side plots without giving any of them enough screen time
to shine and fails miserably to balance them all, A lot of unnecessary CGI usage like most of these Disney remakes does, Weird broken pacing, Like.. I don't even know where to start with this one, and PG-13 rating didn't really help it either, I think they wanted to do much more stuff in this movie, Especially with the violence, but they couldn't due to the movie being PG-13, ""We gotta make the movie PG-13 so more people could see it, so we could make a lot of money"" I think an R rating would've improve the quirky of the movie.. but still I don't think that will fix how boring and hollow it all was.I think the biggest problem with this movie is how boring and uninteresting it is, Like.. how can make a movie about a guy that lives in a jungle and was raised by gorillas boring, That's impossible and somehow this movie did it.The only thing keeping away me from giving this movie a one star rating is because of one scene where Tarzan tells Samuel L. Jackson's character to kneel down to a gorilla to show his respect and Samuel L. Jackson reply to Tarzan saying ""Do you want me to lick his nuts too?"" That's honestly the only good part in this movie, Just watch the scene on YouTube and skip everything else, Such a disappointment..2/10.",The Legend of Tarzan
206,westen1223,The Legend isn't specified,6,7 July 2016,"I was quite hoping this film was going to be as similar to 1999's Tarzan but wasn't what I expected.The Legend of Tarzan actually starts a year after Tarzan or John Clayton, whatever his name is, leaves the jungle with his beautiful wife (which she is actually), Margot Robbie as Jane. The film started to go a tad slow and was a bit boring. The film is just difficult to keep up with, nothing makes sense and the plot is just sluggish and confusing, very weak also. Alexander Skarsgård's portrayal as Tarzan seemed a bit odd and dull though, his character was difficult to understand for me and what he thinks is best, makes him more wounded and weak. But Margot Robbie's portrayal was lovely and understandable. She showed her character as being lovable, caring and very rebellious which I thought was intriguing. Although this film showed many errors in its path, I think it was an average, mediocre film that showed a lot of scenes that were just.. dope.

209,cutesd,If only ...,8,20 February 2017,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I saw previews containing the bad CGI gorillas and decided I would rather sit this one out. But when it popped up on HBO I figured, eh, what the hell. I was expecting the classic Tarzan story and was surprised that this film actually attempted a historical narrative ... an inaccurate and idealized one, but it was a decent effort. If nothing else it might make people look up who King Leopold II was. But just like Tarantino did with Inglorious Basterds, Legend of Tarzan tells a story of how we wish history had gone. If only man and beast had fought side by side to toss Leopold's sadistic, dismembering, cronies out of the country leaving the natives and the animals in peace. Instead of the brutal genocide of millions of Congolese in a region full of rubber not diamonds.Historical inaccuracies aside, I found the action to be engaging, the CGI didn't bother me as much as I thought it would, Skarsgard is an excellent Tarzan, I really enjoyed Jane, and Christoph Waltz is as vile a villain as ever. You can't help but love him. The acting was above par for an action film, Skarsgard had good chemistry with both Jackson and Robbie. I liked the story and I think the film brought a level of depth and emotion to the tale that exceeded my expectations. It's Tarzan people not Shakespeare. Of course the plot is predictable, it's not an original story. The character has been around for over a century. It's a half-naked dude raised by apes who swings on vines and jumps off cliffs, I'm not sure why anyone would expect it to be realistic. It's an action flick not a documentary, and it's a very good action flick. Enjoy it for what it is.",The Legend of Tarzan
210,zadkine,Romance & Adventure,10,4 July 2016,"Ah, yes, this is why we go to the movies. Entertaining, inspiring, an escape, thrilling and wildly imaginative, ""The Legend of Tarzan"" would make Edgar Rice Burroughs proud. And I think he'd enjoy the updating of the story by using as a backdrop the horrifying, true story of the many atrocities committed by Belgian King Leopold in the Congo. This movie is likely to go unappreciated by ""serious"" film critics just as Burroughs was neglected by serious literary critics. Although In a ""Paris Review"" interview, Ray Bradbury said of him that ""Edgar Rice Burroughs never would have looked upon himself as a social mover and shaker with social obligations. But as it turns out – and I love to say it because it upsets everyone terribly – Burroughs is probably the most influential writer in the entire history of the world..."" Bradbury continued - ""...by giving romance and adventure to a whole generation of boys, Burroughs caused them to go out and decide to become special."" This movie couldn't be more true to Burroughs' portrayal of Tarzan, Jane, and the Mangani, the fictional species of great apes that foster and raise Tarzan.",The Legend of Tarzan
211,tymbus,"Ahahhhahahhherrmmmmmmm, maybe not..",5,20 July 2016,"The new Tarzan movie is an interesting take on the character but lacks the spark of the remake of Jungle Book. Creator Edgar Rice Burroughs was probably inspired by Kipling's Jungle stories to create the pulpish hero Lord Greystoke, who is brought up in the jungle by apes (Kipling opined the Tarzan books were deliberately badly written by Burroughs to see what he could get away with in print).Burroughs himself was self-effacing. When academic Queenie Leavis wrote to him for her investigation into fiction and the reading public, he confirmed her worst fears by admitting his work did not aspire to great literature. Tarzan also draws on mythology (e.g. the legend of Romulus and Remus bought up by wolves), racist ideology - a white man lording it over a jungle kingdom (seen again in The Phantom comic strip). and ideas about the duality of human nature. The new movie intelligently places Tarzan in his historical context. Unlike the Jungle Book movie's weirdly decontextualized Jungle, here we are firmly in Belgium occupied territory, the colonial context that would later provide the setting for that other adventurer, Tintin. the look of the film is painterly, particularly the Jungle scenes which recall the work of Frank Frazetta while the ferocious fight between Tarzan and his ape brother recalls the dynamic work of Joe Kubert on the Tarzan comic strip.All the right elements are in place, Alexander Skarsgård makes for a convincing Tarzan, but the story structure falters . The final act pulls a Belgium battle fleet out of the hat and the sudden arrival of Tarzan's army of animals too closely recalls Jumanji. It also smack of over kill - the villainous Léon Rom (Christoph Waltz) is eaten by an entire bask of crocodiles. A dramatic need for commentary, exposition and dialogue means Tarzan is saddled with an American envoy, George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson). Jackson's character allows the movie to address issues of colonialism and slavery but I found him anachronistic and his interjections intrusive.The cinema where I saw the picture was almost empty, a nostalgic reminder of cinema going in the Seventies, a time when Tarzan was still on TV screens (I grew up with a fear of quick sand which seemed all pervasive in TV's Tarzan and Western shows). But while this latest adventure may not be the Summer blockbuster that was hoped for, it is a creditable take on the hero. Burroughs wrote 27 sequels. This movie seems to draw some of its inspiration from Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar. However, I doubt we'll be seeing any more adaptations for a while.",The Legend of Tarzan

Seriously, could anyone follow this film if he or she saw it in a theater? I watched the DVD at home, which gave me the benefit of the ""pause"" and ""rewind"" controls (to say nothing of the closed captions), but nothing could redeem this disaster.Tarzan, Jane, Doctor Williams, and Rom were all miscast. Poor Samuel Jackson (the doctor). He tried, but the role did not suit him. Jackson reminded me of an aging ""studio"" actor trying to fulfill his contract before obtaining his release to make pictures for Republic Studios.The story-line is so contrived that it requires no further analysis.There is so little character development that it, too, requires no further analysis.The computer graphics are, at times, first-rate, but they eventually accentuate the ""cartoonish"" quality of the film.I do not enjoy denigrating what was obviously a serious effort to provide entertainment.

The flashbacks were a good way of putting across Tarzan's origins (though I can't imagine who doesn't know them) and the story had a cracking pace after the introductory part. Both heroes and villains were over the top but that was fine - it's basically a comic book on celluloid. The CGI was obviously CGI and that wasn't a big issue.

And the villain seems to be just pulled from some Hollywood sociopath/megalomaniac template. No effort at all there. In fact, that just about sums it up: no dramatic effort, so typical of the CGI era of movies. And the scene with all the animals at the end? The equivalent of all the kids in the neighbourhood getting together to defeat the common enemy. Childish.

There was some romance to be sure but it is much more a bromance between Tarzan and George Washington Williams. Skarsgard and Jackson were marvelous to watch and their scenes together snapped and sparked. Skarsgard is a superb Tarzan and plays the role with restrained abandon if that makes sense. The action/fight scenes were absolutely fantastic. I wish there had been more of them. The final action sequence is one of the best I've ever seen. The cinematic beauty of the movie is astounding.

Waltz is a villain it seems that he always plays these kind of roles, he makes it with the zeal you expect of him, conniving serpent like, one the best actors of his generation he has the talent. Tarzan aka John Clayton is a man that reckons his wild side but is at peace with his past eventually, he respects, loves nature and treats animals as equals, he a good guy, he wants justice for his people. The plot is about a trying to pay the default of a Colonial and imperialist king with diamonds so that they can have a standing army to rule the land.

Jane has a really good role in the film, has an incredible emotional connection with an African tribe (not a spoiler, don't worry), yet, some of her scenes are so cheesy between her an Tarzan that it pulled me as the viewer away from believing in the story.That said, the film does an incredible job showing the craftiness of wicked men, the fight for good, and the power of changing one's heart...all good stuff.

I was thinking that Tarzan has been done to death, but I was surprised and really enjoyed this. In the safe hands of Director David Yates I found myself drawn into the Tarzan world and didn't find any low points, it was well paced and kept me interested. Alexander Skarsgård who normally plays small roles in films, does a decent job as the lead actor. Christoph Waltz is great as usual, and Margot Robbie as Jane also is good, it has been a big year for this up and coming Australian actor.

221,gmwatling,Tarzan is still as LEGEND!!,9,9 October 2017,"Tarzan has always been a LEGEND!!!!! And he will continue to be a legend. Following on the heels of the Jungle Book remake and throwing its release-date lot in with Spielberg's BFG, this revisit to an equally beloved childhood character is in good company when it comes to the more serious end of the family movie genre. While animated flicks and new creations can rely on slapstick setups, 'hilarious' side-kick characters, modern-song medleys and loud, loud, loud colours, movies like these tend to carefully present old favourites in a more subtle package. The Legend of Tarzan, at its best, does exactly this – presenting a Sunday matinée movie full of good acting, a simple story, and blended CGIwith a calmness that comes with not having your senses assaulted by lurid colour and noise. The Legend of Tarzan is a solid ode to a character that continues to draw the imagination of children and filmmakers alike. Overall a perfectly fine family movie that trundles along at an even pace, and offers an oasis of calm in the barrage of over-hyped kids' movies making the summer circuit. The CGI used in the film is unbelievable I mean at times I totally forgot that it was CGI (Computer Generated Imagery)it was well and truly used to its full potential in this film. Furthermore, the aesthetics of it were amazing, there were not any blinding scenes or dull scenes that made it difficult for the audience to watch. In addition, they really stepped up their game with this as it was a valiant film through and through. I have already seen the film three times and I would confidently recommend this to anyone.

Do not even think on impressing people with dazzling images. Today's CG provided by commercial 3rd parties are achieving that all movies look the same, so you cannot rely any more on special effects. You can only rely on a good story. So just try to follow the lines. But in this movie they just want to reach the teenager market, the same that would love The Hunger Games or any Marvel franchise: a good looking but absolutely inexpressive main character, a beautiful girl and a funny black man. The plot is laughable, with more holes on it than a Swiss cheese, and the only known name, Samuel L. Jackson, looks here even more out of context and more fictitious than Morgan Freeman in Prince of Thieves. Is it really needed to include a black US actor in order to gain access to the thousands of US theaters in no matter what story? Is it really needed to be so much Anglocentric as to make the US/GB team a supreme moral reference against slavery? US abolished slavery in 1865, and deep into the XX Century segregation existed!

227,elale-573-971300,great action and great animals,9,14 July 2016,"This is a great action movie! It's one great action or fight scene after another, with a minimum of still, quiet scenes. Also, there are kitties. Great big ones. Great stuff: Effects:There are some great effects, but the best ones are the ones I can't tell from reality. Most of the animals must be CGI but they don't look like weird jumpy cartoons like most CGI always has. The part where Tarzan and the gorillas swing from vines had to be CGI too but except for a couple of seconds here and there it looked really realistic. Did they do something to make the actor's hands and arms look like he really walked on his knuckles and swung from trees? If they did, it was a great effect, and if it was real it was even more impressive. I haven't read up on the movie yet to see which it was; I like to give my review fresh from seeing it before learning too much from other sources or reading other reviews. Animals:It was wonderful to see animals in a movie actually acting like animals. Movie animals usually act like humans. These animals don't have silly ""witty"" dialogue. They talk only with their own animal cries and body language. It was a real treat for me to see the lions doing the cheek- rub thing like house cats do. They act like cats! All the animal scenes are really well done. A couple of minor points: the stampede seemed to a bit more destructive than one would expect, but perhaps some of the destruction was from someone shooting, there was so much going on I might have missed it; and when Tarzan goes toe to toe with a gorilla, even though that was a dominance display and not a real fight, I thought Tarzan was little bit less banged up than was entirely realistic, despite having to have some surface first aid. Human vs. gorilla is just really no contest, even a human at the absolute peak of human strength. Those are really minor quibbles, though, and they don't detract from the plot because they are just action details. Africa: I really liked the singing. I don't know enough about Africa to know if the songs, clothing, customs surrounding births and rites of passage, etc. were authentic or not, but they seemed to be. I also liked how the script worked in some history and managed to make the actions of the Belgian soldiers and villains believable. Not so great: Women Jane was OK, and the village women and their songs were really fun, but the best female character was the gorilla, Tarzan's mom. The only reason I'm giving this movie a 9 instead of a 10 is because I was just kind of meh about Jane. If you have to have a really good human female character in the movie to enjoy it, then this isn't the movie for you. I'm enough of a tomboy to be able to identify with Tarzan, but that's just me. If you are going to be identifying with Jane you might not find this as enjoyable as I did. Conclusion: if action is your thing, see it.",The Legend of Tarzan

I'll start from the least bad thing, and work my way to the worst aspect of this film. Don't worry, there's no spoilers.First, the acting is terrible. It's like Yates just told them what to do and say right before they rolled the camera. You don't really feel like the characters are real.Second, the writing is atrocious. They go from language and dialect of the era, to SLJ saying some slang from this day and age. Like, come on, dude. Be better.Third, they obviously didn't do much research into the accuracy of certain weaponry they used in the film that originated from the time era, you'll see what I mean when you watch the climax of the film.Fourth, and worst of all,...the animation and special effects are ATROCIOUS.

Especially, near the end, when he communicates with the crocodiles is noteworthy.We can go further in the film's depiction of Tarzan, for example, even if not well developed, is how Tarzan will unite the animals of the jungle for a one extraordinary stamped.In addition, one could say that the special effects showing Tarzan swinging from one tree to another closely resembles Spiderman. However, the great flaw of this film is that of not having focused on Tarzan and his amazing gift of speaking or communicating with animals. It would have been fun to have gone deeper into his gift and not dwell on a tragic historical part of history.To conclude, in the 1984 version when Tarzan (Christopher Lambert) fights the leader of the gorillas, it is worth the viewing. In parallel, the gorilla in Tarzan (2016), the ape he was brought up with, considers Tarzan, his brother, an outcast. The battle between the two is weak compared to the 1984 version.A film, that I hope, will have a sequel if the true focus on Tarzan would be his gift rather than politics.",The Legend of Tarzan
232,Hbarker-32233,Laaaaaaame,3,21 December 2016,"I try to follow trends in the trades but I can never quite fathom the hows and whys of ancient properties like The Legend Of Tarzan being rebooted into mega-budget wannabe franchise-starters. Were the folks at Warner Brothers really so jealous of Disney's John Carter grosses that they just *had* to jump aboard that Edgar Rice Burroughs money train? This hardly seems worth the trouble, given the political minefields of the material in this enlightened age, and today's youngsters don't exactly appear to be clamoring for colonialist pulp adventures from the early 1910s.But if you had any misgivings about the possibly queasy overtones of making another Tarzan movie in the year of our lord 2016, rest assured they're shared by the filmmakers. It is a strange feeling to be watching a movie that seems to be apologizing for itself as it goes along.Altogether sheepish for a film about the Lord of the Apes, this particular Tarzan tries to write around the Legend's more problematic elements by grounding the tale in a bloody chapter of actual African history. Samuel L. Jackson co-stars as the real-life George Washington Williams, an American Civil War hero and the first to speak out against King Leopold II's brutal slave-driving regime in the Belgian Congo. He still gets to do that in the movie, but he also gets to be Tarzan's sidekick and make comic relief jokes about licking a gorilla's nuts.Lord Greystoke (Alexander Skarsgard) is happily civilized these days, chilling at his stately British manor with his hot schoolteacher wife Jane (Margot Robbie) when he's invited back to darkest Africa on some sort of diplomatic mission that couldn't possibly sound shadier. Turns out it's all a trap — setup for a lip-smacking baddie in a Fitzcarraldo suit (Christoph Waltz, still giving the only performance Christoph Waltz ever gives) to turn Tarzan over to a tribe leader with a grudge (Djimon Hounsou, doing his umpteenth variation on the noble savage) in exchange for the diamonds King Leopold needs to foment his slave empire. Or something like that.Screenwriters Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer (yes, he of Hustle And Flow, Black Snake Moan and the Footloose remake) try their mightiest to lend the moldy tropes a modern sensibility, even though most of the time they're just paying lip service. Robbie, a spry starlet with charisma to burn, busts out of the gate announcing she's no damsel in distress, then proceeds to spend the rest of the picture tied up and waiting to be rescued. Waltz carries with him a rosary that he uses as a garrote, which I think might supposed to be symbolism or something but I can't tell because it's too subtle.Really we're just stalling until Stellan Skarsgard's giant kid rips off his shirt and starts swinging from vines, bossing around all the bwanas and the beasts. The movie gives Jackson a monologue startlingly similar to (though considerably less profane than) a character beat from his sadistic Major Marquis in The Hateful Eight, memories of which just serve to further show up the icky British power fantasy of a white nobleman raised in the wild, lording his natural-born supremacy over interchangeable natives and monkeys. Again, was this really a movie worth making at our particular moment? A few years ago Gore Verbinski and Johnny Depp revived The Lone Ranger as a grandly psychedelic and subversive folly that seethed with righteous hatred over this country's treatment of Native Americans. I still can't believe that Disney's Fourth-of-July blockbuster climaxed with the title character gunning down countless U.S. soldiers to the tune of the William Tell Overture. (I often think about that poor bastard sitting near me who'd brought his eight-year-old son. There must have been some tough questions during their drive to the fireworks that night.) But The Legend Of Tarzan isn't interested in blowing up its central myth so much as it bashfully just wants to get it overwith.Director David Yates, who herded the last sixteen or seventeen Harry Potter pictures across the screen, handles The Legend Of Tarzan as politely as possible under the circumstances, as if well aware of the unfortunate iconography and doing his best to downplay it. I can't be sure if it was an issue with the 3D transfer I saw, but the film looks bleary and washed-out. Even the jungle greens are olive drab, adding to the air of resignation that leaks from the film's second hour like a deflating balloon. Skarsgard is a gorgeously sculptured hunk of inertia. If only he had half the screen presence of his abs, we might be getting somewhere.It's impossible not to come away from The Legend Of Tarzan wishing that a more aggressive, adventurous filmmaker – like Craig Brewer, maybe – might someday tell the real George Washington Williams story. I bet they could even get Samuel L. Jackson to play him.",The Legend of Tarzan
233,sandimcg,Amazing movie - how did they make this?,10,4 August 2016,I had no expectations of this movie - don't even recall seeing a trailer. My husband wanted to see it - so we did (not in 3D). I was mesmerized! I thought it was incredible how real every animal scene was - will have to find out how they did this. The story was just fantastic. The scenery was spectacular - to me a must-see on the big screen. This Tarzan version was the best one I've ever seen (think I've seen them all) and apparently very true to the original story (nope - never read it - will now). It was captivating. The actors were excellent. I was completely enthralled and at the end - I didn't want it to be over. It reminded me of the thrill of the good old days of going to the Saturday afternoon movies growing up (I know - most of you will never know the fun of the simpler times :-). I was easily impressed then - not so much so today - with so MANY incredible movies. Tarzan is action-packed and REALLY entertaining. I had to go right home and tell family and friends to go see it before it is out of theaters! I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed.,The Legend of Tarzan
234,steve_ford53,CGI is the best part of this movie,3,30 June 2016,"I have never read the Tarzan series of novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs, but having grown up watching Tarzan movies on Saturday morning TV with my favorite Tarzan, Johnny Weissmuller, I felt I had a pretty good handle on Tarzan's story. I knew his parents died when he was just an infant, and he was taken by a shrewdness of apes and raised to adulthood.I went to the theater expecting the retelling of ""Tarzan of the Apes"" and how this young boy grew to become the ""King of the Jungle"". I was excited about the film because the use of CGI in today's movie making often delivers the most outstanding special effects. I was not disappointed - the CGI effects, especially of the animals, was great.However, I really feel this movie is mis-titled. This wasn't the story penned by Mr. Burroughs in 1912, but it was more of a political statement about man's inhumanity. The exploitation of other human beings is really the center piece of the movie. There is also a scene of a train where several of the cars are filled with tusks showing how the human race, especially the Europeans, ravaged an entire continent.There were flashback moments in the movie that lets the viewer know how this young British boy is taken by the apes and the bond he develops with the animals. The movie also touches on Tarzan's strained relationship with one of the tribes. However, the main story has Tarzan as the hero of the day, but it really isn't about Tarzan.Christoph Waltz plays the evil character to Tarzan's good and Mr. Waltz is very good at playing a man with no real moral compass. A man of greed who will do anything to get what he wants.I am not really thrilled with this rendition of Tarzan and would only recommend it for its special effects. I think you can wait to see this movie when it shows up on Netflix or another cable or streaming service.",The Legend of Tarzan

This is just a fashion show, plus showing nothing but a ridiculous plot and terrible clothing choices. The sensitive lollipop kids got this movie so politically correct, it is a horrible and painful movie to watch. As for Tarzan, he even looks laughable in those pants swinging from vines. For over 100 years Tarzan wore a loin cloth. Not this time, the lollipop kids saw to that. A horrible movie on so many levels.What the heck are these positive reviews for.Terrible terrible plot as well.Tarzan is the king of the jungle.

236,iepw12,Moments of sheer brilliance with some irritation,8,14 July 2016,All that is Edgar Rice Burroughs is portrayed perfectly in this story based on his characters. I cannot emphasise enough the sheer brilliance of the films ability to translate onto the screen every aspect of the ERB's world from the stunning landscapes to the animals imbued with almost human demeanour's to make Tarzans connection with them all the more real. All this makes the film well worth watching and a real cut above many drama/adventure type films which we are constantly being fed. Iwill go and watch it again probably on the big screen for all the reasons mentioned. However whilst I much admire one very famous actor who has asignificant role in the film I found his character and script veryirritating and not necessary for the story.I also found what seemed to me an almost political point making all through the film to be very annoying and detracting from the beauty of the characters and original idea. I think perhaps the script writers tried almost too hard when all we needed was ERB's world brought to life. Casting notwithstanding the 'star' already mentioned was perfect and the lord of the jungle himself was beyond words in the role.,The Legend of Tarzan
237,jpatrick-68632,Digital Animals just don't cut the mustard,4,8 July 2016,"Our cinematic adventure this week was The Legend of Tarzan. We chose this because we had seen the shorts for it when we saw Central Intelligence last week and we saw THAT because Dwayne was in it and my wife is a bit keen on Dwayne and it went OK and I laughed a bit and the wife tittered quite a bit.Tarzan's father buries his mother (she was dead so it's OK) and then get's killed by FBDA's (Great Big Digitized Apes) but Tarzan is just a little baby and a chick FBDA takes a shine to him and adopts him and raises him and teaches him to do FBDA stuff like walk on all fours. As a result Tarzan has ginormous hands and thoughts sprang unbidden of prostate examinations Tarzan sniffs Jane's crotch and so they get married, it being the Victorian era and they being the rules.Tarzan (now known as John Clayton III) and Jane (still known as Jane) move to England and live in a FBH (Great Big House). He is talked into leaving his FBH and going back to the Congo by Samuel L. Jackson who has taken time off from grooming children to ruin their lives gambling.King Leopold is the worst Belgian ever, at least until Mathias Cormann, and he is broke and needs to get money to raise an army to get diamonds so he isn't poor anymore. He has a FBB (Really Bad Baddie) working for him who strangles folk with a spider web crucifix. He (the FBB) knows Gambling Man from 'Django Unchained' and he killed people in that too.To do this he enslaves Congolese to build a railway line and Tarzan thinks that this is wrong and he's right too so he has a fight with his FBDA brother and cops an absolute flogging the like of which I haven't seen since Lenny took onnabear in 'The Execrable'.Tarzan signals his readiness to Jane by hiding and imitating the mating calls of various animals. I kid you not. Most men are simply 'conscious'.Anyway there are fights and Mr Zan calls upon his animal wantoks. Wildebeest (digitized – Digi-Beests?) are turned into deadly weapons of war. All the animals are digitized and it is abundantly clear that the technology just does not yet cut the mustard. There are Digi-lions, Digi-diles and Digi-potamii. And of course FBDA's This means, I presume, that lots of the acting was in front of blank screens. And it shows.Tarzan's jungle call is pretty cool All in all it's about as plausible as Noah. Jane is pretty cute. Better'n 'Interstellar'. Nowhere near as good as 'Deadpool' or any other good movie you might think of.",The Legend of Tarzan
238,herbrarnold,The Best Summer Movie!,10,10 July 2016,"I had to tell you all about one of the surprise fantastic films of the summer. I must agree that ""The Legend of Tarzan"" was an action-packed, scenic epic with great character actors and a dramatic musical score. The story has Tarzan (portrayed by an amazingly swelt, Alexander Skarsgard - AKA Eric from TrueBlood) Margot Robbie is a spitfire Jane, and Christoph Waltz is fantastic as the bad guy. The film starts with a civilized Tarzan, already a part of high society, who is asked by Samuel L Jackson (also a great addition to the cast) to return to the jungle for a special mission. The mission is exciting, and the animal special effects are the best I've seen. (and yes - animals and humans meet their demise, but neither are innocent of wrongdoing and all are created by CGI) Now this was a great summer movie! (as apposed to the disappointing Independence Day -Resurgence)In fact, I thought it was one of the best epic films in many years.",The Legend of Tarzan
239,doughelo,Revenge fantasy in the Congo,3,30 August 2016,"I can't comment on the movie as a whole, since I walked out halfway through. But I had 3 major objections to what I did see:Margot Robbie's Jane is annoyingly modern and out of context of the time. Held hostage by the villain, she is unrelentingly sassy and shows no sign of even slight concern for herself or her friends threatened with death. And she's so pure and good the butterflies flock to her.Making a swashbuckling revenge fantasy out of an historical atrocity borders on the offensive, the prime example being Inglorious Basterds. If they had showed the true story of how 10 million people died in the Congo for Leopold's profit, it would have been a very depressing movie. The real Leon Rom did not pay for his crimes, while here he is a caricature who meets a deservedly gruesome end. Good is saintly and Evil punished. Sorry, no way a 200 pound human slams at top speed into an 800 pound gorilla and comes out without rib splinters poking out of his lungs.",The Legend of Tarzan
240,Diddisnap,Nearly Excellent,9,14 May 2017,"I recorded Tarzan at home from one of the Premium channels. It sat there for like two months. Finally, I watched it, and I was amazed. It was a fantastic movie! I don't quite understand why it doesn't have at least a 7.5 on the IMDb rating or a 2/4 from RogerEbert.com when it should really be a 3/4.I thought this movie would be just a change-up of the story many of us already know. Not at all, as it continues where the story leaves off. There are fantastic performances by Alexander Skarsgard, Margot Robbie, Samuel L Jackson, Christopher Waltz, and Djimon Hounsou, but Alexander as Tarzan and Margot as Jane were the standouts and perfect for the roles. This movie was intense, moving, sad, and even times funny. I would highly recommend.",The Legend of Tarzan
241,kjell-ahlstrom,Zzzzzzzz,1,13 July 2016,"Let me start this review by saying that I have never read Tarzan, nor seen any film adaption of him before, cartoon or live-action. I went in with a blank slate and no expectations to the theater hoping to see a fun adventure movie. Boy was I disappointed. A great adventure movie starts with memorable characters. Tarzan is neither a Jack T. Colton, nor an Indiana Jones. He has neither charm, wit or any other adventure movie admirable qualities. Jane is also no Joan Wilder or a Willie Scott, even if she is more interesting than Tarzan. The first part is dreadfully slow paced with about the same passion and emotions as a dead fish. Then suddenly it feels like the scriptwriter got tired of his own script and just wanted it to end. Queue Deus Ex Machina, then the movie is finally over. Worst movie I have seen this year, only a TV rerun of Hale Berrys Catwoman comes close.",The Legend of Tarzan
242,DannyDnB,Another Hollywood Mess.,4,22 October 2016,"Going into this movie, I had a good idea of what I was going to experience, but I must say, this movie felt incredibly flat, and now that I look back on it, I feel like there is not much good to be said about this movie.I actually thought that the premise of the movie was quite interesting. The story focuses on Tarzan after having left the jungle and taken up more of a civilized human lifestyle. He finds his way back due to certain events and has to save his people from greedy Beligish colonizers.I liked how the story focuses on a more worldly Tarzan who is not the ape-man he once was. I think that, given to the right people, this movie could really have been something really great, but unfortunately, the movie goes astray and loses it's direction. What we end up with is a very generic adventure film. Everything from the writing to the acting to the score feel like they were done in a very short span of time. There are moments in this film that are so cliché that you wonder what these film-makers were thinking. It just felt lazy.The animation of the animals is decent at times, but ultimately fails, because we see through it ashamedly often.This movie is a flop, and it could have been a lot better in many ways. It seems like Hollywood has been getting this a lot lately, Warner Brothers even more so. The Legend of Tarzen will deliver an interesting take on the story of Tarzen, but it doesn't go very far at all.",The Legend of Tarzan
243,JustALittleBitRandom,Fresh and clever new take on the story of Tarzan,7,8 August 2016,"After settling down and getting used to life in London Tarzan must go back to the jungles where he used to live ,along with his wife and friend, to investigate strange goings on that have been occurring near there.Many of the reviews for this film have been fairly negative and I hadn't seen any trailers for this film so I didn't know what to think when walking in but as always I went into the film with an open mind. And what I was greeted with was a fun, fast paced, inventive and imaginative, fresh new take on Tarzan. The plot of the film is really clever and I like the idea of seeing what happens to the character of Tarzan after the story that we all know. The action in the film is very good and it adds to the large amount of tension that the plot already holds. The acting is also very good from all and the way the film is shot you feel as if you are actually there in the world of the film and that you area character spectating all the events that are happening and this leads to the fact that the film is a lot of fun, I genuinely had fun watching this film which is something that can't be said for a lot of films that have been released recently. If there is one major problem with the film it's that the CGI animals are very clearly CGI animals as they aren't very realistic and the way they look also shows how very clearly computer generated they are. One other small problem is that the films could be cut a tiny bit just because it does seem to drag in the last five to ten minutes and the entire audience do seem to get a tiny bit restless near the end just because of length but the film is still fairly fun and because it isn't for that long and the film wraps up quickly this point is mostly ,but not completely, excusable.Lot's of fun, imaginative and inventive, fresh and filled with fast paced action The Legend Of Tarzan is a fun new take on the famous vine swinging character. **** <-- Four Stars",The Legend of Tarzan

Like most recent summer flicks, the movie lacks authenticity, character development, and hopeful excitement that most would like to see in a good-feel movie. In return, the moviegoer gets poorly weaved flashback scenes and basically forced to watch a plainly chaotic film. Furthermore, the characters seem to have come out of a sitcom or reality TV show, with no interest for dramatic structure. Moreover, the level of violence is simply too much for small children to watch.Here is the bottom line: This is not a good family movie, but rather an action one with plenty of special effects that many will still enjoy.",The Legend of Tarzan

Casting was generally superb. Margot Robbie was a convincing and beautiful Jane and Christoph Walz was his usual urbanely villainous self although he's in danger of being typecast having played the same role in his last three or four films. .But the fatal flaw in the casting was Tarzan himself. Having a great body wasn't enough for me; Alexander Skarsgard as Tarzan was too wooden an actor with a generally inexpressive face. Yes, he looked like an aristocrat but not like Tarzan. Imagine a young Sean Connery in the role - perfect. Tom Hardy nearly made the part and too bad he didn't. Did you ask yourself how did an ape man manage to shave in the jungle? Or more to the point, why would he? OK, Johnny Weismuller was beardless and so were all the other cinematic Tarzans but still a scruffy beard would have been more realistic.",The Legend of Tarzan

Christoph Waltz is playing the same bad guy he's played in four or five other movies. Skarsguard plays the strong silent type well but there's not a lot of fire there. Samuel L Jackson just seems like a late arrival to the whole thing. His part seemed more of an appendage to the story than an Intercal part of it. The color palette was horrible with muted blues and blacks and browns all through the movie. To me the story was reasonably disjointed and repetitive. Jane is captured, Jane escapes, Jane is captured again, Jane escapes, etc.Frankly I thought the earlier Johnny Weissmuller movies had better action in them, but this was a pleasant enough movie to see with my family on a Sunday afternoon.",The Legend of Tarzan

It looks incredibly realistic thanks to technological advances. It makes the animals look so cool, and realistic it makes it hard to tell it is cgi. There are a lot of brief flashbacks in this film, all of which help to put the story together so that everything that has happened makes sense. These are all quite exciting and really help the move the story further. These were a good idea for the film and I am glad they were added in in different places throughout the film. The only flaw is that the plot goes a bit slow at first, but it picks up quite quickly and all the good stuff happens.

254,evamatijevic,Disappointment like no other,5,24 April 2021,"Some stories are just not meant to be consumed as movies. And even if we put aside the ridiculous idea that the story about an aristocratic man ape is something worth working on, everything else about this movie was so underwhelming.Let's start with actors. The all star cast consisting of Alexander Skarsgård, Margot Robbie, Samuel L. Jackson and Christoph Waltz may have attracted some audience, but they did little to stop them from regretting ever starting this movie. Samuel L. Jackson did a fine job, but a stand alone movie about his character would be much wiser choice. On the same note, I have nothing negative to say about Margot Robbie - she did her best with very little she was given. As for Waltz and Skarsgård, thanks to them this version of Tarzan is now one of the very few movies where both the protagonist and the antagonist are equally bland. And while Skarsgård needs to book acting lessons as soon as possible (Tarzan had one face throughout the movie and that's the face of someone bored to death), Waltz's acting was fine but he needs to stop taking roles that have any resemblances to either Col. Hans Landa or Dr. King Schultz. I'm tired of seeing him in the same roles.Plot was equally bad and predictable. I don't know much about the original Tarzan books, but it's exceptionally inconsiderate, or better yet tone-deaf, to place a story like this in Belgian Kongo and then to go so far as not to give atrocities that happened there a proper portrayal. Given that the budget was $180 million, they had more than enough space to do this story decently, and not squander it all on that ending consisting solely of special effects.",The Legend of Tarzan

The openingsequence does not say anything except, hey look at me i am trying to make a cool looking sequence. It does not add to the storytelling, this goes on throughout the whole movie.The acting was at some points laughable, the lead was, in my opinion, totally miscast.

256,Iron-Bat-Prime,"The Legend Of Tarzan: ""Your Tarzan! Tarzan?""",6,21 July 2016,"Rating: 6.5, OK Movie* Imagine if you will, that Hollywood is a science lab and its movies are all elements. When you mix the Director of 4 Harry Potter Movies (David Yates), the story of Avatar (8.5) and the characters of Tarzan (8.7) you create and unstable element. Tarzan is my favourite Disney movie, let alone animated movie due to it's heart warming story, characters and most of all Phill Collin's Music. However The Legend Of Tarzan tries so hard to be something it's not, a jungle of a conflict.* Characters: - Tarzan: Is this movie called The Legend Of Tarzan, or the legend of John Clayton? I understand what the directors are going for with his character, but while Alexander Skars'gard has the body of a jungle man, he does not suit the character of one. BTW, isn't Clayton the villain in the original Disney movie?Jane: I have many mixed feelings about Margot Robbie's Jane, at some moments I rather like her boldness and in other scenes I just find her rather annoying. Robbie is talented but she is not Tarzan's Jane.Leon Rom: Ever since I watched Django Unchained (9.5) I have absolutely loved Christoph Waltz, as he can play a good and a bad guy, and he does demonstrate this well in his new character, Leon Rom.George Washington Williams: I love Samuel L. Jackson, no matter what movie he stars in. His character does lighten the mood in this movie as he delivers the comedy and action this movie was in desperate need of.* Plot & Design: Honestly I do like the movie's plot, as it does try to establish the themes of conflict, racism and colonisation. However they do travel off the main story line of John Clayt.... I Mean Tarzan. The landscapes are beautiful, however there more grasslands then jungles... The animals CGI is decent but no where as good as The Jungle Book's (8.5).* I can't hate it because Tarzan is my Childhood, but at the same time I don't like it. I do appreciate it's unique twist, however this adaptation lacks enjoyment and magic, particularly when it comes from the Director of Harry Potter? Its OK, but don't expect too much, its removed too many key features, especially Phill Collins!

The movie has great visuals, a unique non-origin Tarzan story, good comic relief by Samuel Jackson, and an interesting villain played by Christoph Waltz, a nice mix of romance and action, and just an overall good summertime movie that can be enjoyed whether you are a single,couple,or entire family.

Seriously now, they haven't had a great success for a long time now. WB needs to step their game up fast. This film is the definition of anti climatic, they're trying too hard to make you feel thrilled and excited but they fail in every aspect. The story is boring and doesn't feel ""real"" at all. They also changed Tarzan's original story (not for the better) and they introduced a completely new story. We jump into a grown up Tarzan from the start and we 'learn' his origin story from endless flashbacks that feel out of place. CG: In 2016 and with a budget of 180 million the CG you would expect the special effects to be awesome but no. Most of the times the animals & the environment look like plastic and they feel ""dead"", without life. They even completely CG'd Tarzan when he swings, jumps and sometimes when he runs (Like WHY?!?!). By saying these it means its not a good movie but its not horrible either. Samuel L. Jackson is in it!!! And he's the only one that succeeds to make you laugh. Ah there is also a good 4-5 minutes involving an African village. OHHH oh. Margot Robbie plays Jane Porter fine I guess?!?!

The strongest human would never be able to fight fairly against an alpha gorilla without the use of weapons. The try hard PC factor was the black American character, George. He's black, but he's American. All native Africans were secondary and not so brilliant as the 3 main white males. The white villain is a mature man with no remarkable physical attributes that could fight with very strong African warriors. And the only female character is a woman that had a miscarriage and wants to have a baby to complete her happiness. The film sends the most toxic possible message to women: motherhood is what will make a woman feel complete and happy.

Many years ago I watched a Soviet movie in which the character, a woman decides to change her skin color in support for poor Africans. I was a kid at that time, but I still felt throwing up. Why good actors accept to play in these movie (Ch. Waltz)? These stories are so taken out of their context to fit the current political trend. I look forward to a remake of ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"". Grimm should get a posthumous libel. So going back to my first question how all this is going to end? I could write a tome about it, but in a summary the answer is BAD; as the movie.",The Legend of Tarzan
263,sven-vanrompaey,Tarzan: A lack of everything,1,11 July 2016,"I can probable sum it up in one word, but let me give it a try.Wasn't expecting much going in this movie, but I was hoping to be surprised. Unfortunately...This is without a doubt the worst movie from 2016. The acting: Horrible. Not even Oscar winner Christopher Waltz, who was once again typecast to play the same role he always does. Dito for Samuel. And Skarsgard? Sorry to say he's the male equivalent of Kristen Stewart. If he would've had fangs he could've easily been Eric Northman 200 years prior to True Blood. Margot Robbie was probable the best thing about this movie....Or maybe the baby elephant, that's still up for debateThe movie wasn't even visually stunning, tons of CGI, which is understandable to some degree, but this was just ridiculous. I didn't count one real-life animal, and this including a butterfly.The whole plot felt (and was) rushed and important moments where brushed aside as filler. There was absolutely no emotion what so ever between any of the characters, nothing memorable about the entire movie, except maybe for the poorly executed finale which I will only remember as a good laugh.And that's about it...",The Legend of Tarzan

The story is a bit all over the place and the comic relief is a bit too common, but not a bad movie all in all. Don't expect the epic long awaited Tarzan movie. Waltz, the best bad guy since Oldman, is once again massively restrained (Spectre) but, delivers a decent performance. To be honest my biggest issue was with the mid action editing, one minute the boats afloat, the next its half sunk, etc etc. Jackson is quality as we've come to expect, with Skarsgard and Robbie looking and sounding the part. It's hard to put your finger on it be honest. You won't feel bad for watching, just don't make it your big Friday/Saturday night movie and you'll be just fine.",The Legend of Tarzan

I wasn't sure what to expect with Margot Robbie but that she did a great job. I was also skeptical of Samuel L. Jackson because of some of his previous movies but thought he did good as well. Also Djimon Hounsoudid a great job as usual. The CGI was so much better in this versus The Jungle Book. I loved the twist in the story too.

Yes, lots of CGI, but WTF - who cares? (it was pretty good btw) Unlike some of the other reviewers I wasn't bored at all and would watch it again some time down the track. Although some reviewers, both here and in the professional press, have been scathing about Alex Skaarsgard's casting and said he was wooden, I thought he was an OK fit for Tarzan, who was never a bundle of laughs :) - it certainly didn't hurt that he is ripped as all hell!(I am in awe of these Scandinavian actors who can adopt a flawless English or American accent - Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau another case in point) - and Margot Robbie was a lovely and feisty Jane. The only thing I found irksome was the inclusion of Samuel Jackson's character, who was superfluous to the plot and added nothing to the attractions of the movie for me. I came away from the movie feeling satisfied with an enjoyable and entertaining evening - I don't think it's giving anything away to say the good guys win and the bad guys get their comeuppance and there is an uplifting feel at the end.

272,moorejared,It was alright.,6,3 July 2016,"Unfortunately, The Legend of Tarzan, for me, was a movie that I did not understand why was made. Nobody was really looking for someone to reboot this movie and it kind of came out of nowhere. And that shows in the movie. First off, the storytelling is very confusing. Tarzan's backstory is spliced in with the present so it goes back and forth between past and present. If you have seen the original movie you probably won't have that many problems but there are some questions being raised because they change the story a little bit in The Legend of Tarzan. I personally felt that they should have made Tarzan's childhood in one scene or a couple scenes in the beginning of the movie and then continue with the story. That may have made the story a little bit easier and better to watch. Also I felt as though Samuel L. Jackson's character was there for no reason. He didn't bring anything else to the story and he was just there. He didn't really do anything substantial and whenever he was on screen I always felt he was wasting space. I did not hate him though. He wasn't all bad and I felt he added some comic relief but I did not understand why he needed to be in the movie. On the other hand Tarzan and Jane were cast very well, Tarzan more than Jane. Margot Robbie was okay as Jane, I felt like she could have done better but Alexander Skarsgård was a very good fit for Tarzan. I think he looked the part and he played the part very well but the story just wasn't told very well to showcase that. Also the CGI was better than I expected. There were some scenes where it was very lackluster but besides that I felt as though the work they did with CGI was very good. In my opinion I would wait for the Legend of Tarzan to come to DVD. I would not go to see it in the theaters because it was not that bad but at the same time it was not that interesting.",The Legend of Tarzan

The plot content, tone, sensibilities, moral code, sense of adventure and excitement that are present in the novels are entirely lacking in this film. The only elements that are retained from the novels are the names of some of the characters and the African setting. The plot of the film has nothing to do with ANY of the actual Tarzan novels. While the novels are utterly thrilling pulp adventures the film is OK at best.It appears that the producers in their desire to keep as many modern viewers happy as possible and thus to maximize their profits decided to ignore the original novels and just make up a story using the name "" Tarzan "" because people are familiar with the name and believe it relates to an adventurous tale. Sad. This is what modern film making has become.Even people unfamiliar with the novels will find this film to have a balance of positives and negatives with the overall result being one of mediocrity. Too bad. Huge budget essentially wasted.I don't think any of the producers or screenwriters or the director himself bothered to spend the 5 hours it would take to read the actual (first) novel. They would have made an entirely different film.There is a reason that Tarzan of the Apes (1912) represents one of the best known stories ever told.

It was hard to really connect with any of the characters, maybe because it felt like we joined the movie halfway into it. I think maybe it would have helped if there was more of an introduction to the characters than what we got. I guess they assume everyone knows the Tarzan origin story, so there isn't a need to tell it again. But in this case they told too little for me at least to connect with the characters.The biggest problem I had with this movie was the awful CGI. The animals looked really bad.

Try making a work of art next time, not this adolescent propaganda crap.Only in America can we still make a film in 2016 in which a woman just finishes giving birth (you know, that death defying act of CHILDBIRTH) and the song the WOMEN in the tribe sing celebrating the birth is about the ""legend"" of the FATHER.

Yes, forget that woman in the hut who just risked her life to give birth...let's sing about all the cool stuff the dad did.And other than Jane, I don't think there is LITERALLY one other female character that speaks in the entire film in a cast of hundreds of men.

You end up seeing a lot of scenes where old friends are being reunited and that is supposed to mean something to the viewer. However, since you have never before seen these character, these actors and obviously any of their background story and relations, you can never relate or feel what this movie is trying to articulate. The flash backs to the past and the narration from the female lead (Margot Robbie) does not help at all. In fact the flash back are actually more interesting and intriguing which makes the main story of the movie looks even worst.

283,niravgohil,Decent Movie,7,4 April 2017,"Honestly, I saw this movie only for Margot Robbie. I was mesmerized by her beauty in previous films and specially in The Wolf of Wall street. She does look stunning though in earlier portion of the film. Speaking of movie, I enjoyed watching it. It shows how Men's greed is destroying the nature. Those aristocrats for the sake of their fake status leading to the killing of innocent animals. Direction was good but the story was somewhat lost as it approached the climax. I didn't find the acting of Alexander that enchanting as it was like he was taken in the film only for showing his body. Christoph was wasted for me and so was Samuel Jackson. Margot on the contrary did he job. After a good start trying to show the emotions Tarzan has for his real home, 'The Jungle' where he grew up, the story then deviated to show that he was like a superhero trying to save his lady love at the end of the day. Still director tried to show that he was a human at last when he got beaten up by the very Mangani brother with whom he grew up. Talking about the things I loved about this movie, first and foremost will definitely be Margot Robbie. Beside that the beautiful cinematography was unforgettable. It shows what this world has and what are we destroying. I like the concept of the very same thing, ""Greed of men destroying Nature.""

289,sleeplessdave_2000,"Or ""Why Belgium Sucks""",4,20 October 2016,"Over the last two decades there have been some extremely successful reinventions of classic characters for the modern age: Zorro, Batman, Sherlock Holmes, James Bond, etc. All of these stay true to the heart of what made the character great to begin with, but ground the character in a practical sensibility that make them relatable to today's audience. I'm guessing this was the intent with Tarzan, the Lord of the Jungle, made famous through the stories of Edgar Rice Borroughs. Tarzan was a staple of early Hollywood, probably most famously played by Johnny Weissmuller, but with the exception of the Disney animated feature in the late 1990's, no one has tried to bring Tarzan back to his big screen roots in a long time. After The Legend of Tarzan, I think it will probably be a long time before anyone else gives it another shot.Read moreBut before we get into the nuts and bolts of why this went flying off the tracks, let's talk about Belgium. This is relevant, the film's entire plot hinges on the basic premise that Belgium is pure evil. If you're not acquainted, Belgium is a country in northwestern Europe, roughly the size of Maryland. It has the unfortunate position of being situated directly between France and Germany, thus whenever the Germans get an itch to go flatten Paris, Belgium is the most direct route. They're also famous for their chocolates. Oh and slavery. Belgians have never met an African tribe they didn't think would be put to better use mining diamonds or standing in front of actively firing weaponry. Now, if I told you that a tremendous part of the plot of The Legend of Tarzan was taken up by painstakingly explaining the Belgians presence in the Congo, the state of their monarch's finances, and the atrocities they were willing to commit to balance their....WAFFLES, Belgians and waffles, can't do without them....where was I before that. Totally blanked, but that's OK because it's really not worth trying to keep track of beyond noting that the personification of Belgian evil is Christoph Waltz, and he's Belgian. And evil.The Legend of Tarzan is a hot pot of mess. It's poorly directed, which is a surprise since David Yates is usually a very steady hand on the wheel. The acting from Waltz, Margot Robbie, Samuel L. Jackson (he's Tarzan's American buddy there to keep an eye on the whole slavery rumor), and others is just weird to bizarre. There are so many different subplots flying out of left field and disappearing into the ether that you can't focus on one for more than a solid 30 seconds before another one pops up like a two-hour game of ""Whack a Subplot"". Robbie, who plays Jane, is given a lot of pluck and I am guessing that the aim was to avoid making her simply a damsel in distress (guess what she is for most of the film? No, not Belgian, but fine supposition). Then there is the dialogue which ranges from cringe-worthy to stupefying (did Jane just make a priest molestation joke to evil Belgian Waltz.....what the what?). Amongst all this madness, Alexander Skarsgard, who plays Tarzan with all the emotion of a fine plank of cedar stands out just because he's not Belgian or acting like a loon (and he talks to animals and yodels in the jungle and STILL is the most normal human in this movie).The film takes place years after Tarzan left the jungle, married Jane, and took up his father's title as Lord Greystroke in England. But then a tidal wave of Belgian plot devices occur (I may have wandered out in search of some waffles for a bit) and he's lured back to his old home in the Congo where he walks and talks and swings with the animals. This, by the way, is honestly the best part of the movie. Watching Tarzan interact with photorealistic CGI animals, and lead them against (wait for it) the Belgian army, is by far the most interesting part of the film. Probably because it actually focused on Tarzan. His youth is interspersed through the whole film in an inelegant and intrusive fashion that does nothing to endear you to Tarzan, or particularly entertain you. It's mostly just another one of those subplots I previously mentioned (sans Belgians).So is there any reason whatsoever to see this film? Well, that depends on 1) your inherent dislike of Belgium and 2) what kind of a fan of cinematography you are. While Tarzan fails on almost every level, the cinematography is absolutely stunning, Oscar-caliber camera work. The film looks gorgeous and features a wonderful score. Additionally, I was not being glib about Tarzan and the animals. The bits we get of him reconnecting with the creatures who raised him and rallying them against (yes brace yourself) the Belgians, are the bits where you see where this could have gone completely differently if the screenwriter hadn't gotten a bad batch of chocolates at some point in their life.Tarzan, to begin with, is a very hard character to make relevant to modern audiences. However, one of my favorite fictional characters is a billionaire who dresses like a six-foot bat and fights crime, so it CAN be done. It just takes a love of the source material, the cleverness to pick the bits that work for a modern audience, and to stay true to what made people love the character in the first place. None of that care is lavished on The Legend of Tarzan, so all you end up with is eye candy (which as far as I know is not made in Belgium).",The Legend of Tarzan

291,NightWatchers,"""The Legend of Tarzan"" did not reach the expectations.",7,3 July 2016,"THIS IS A NON SPOILER REVIEWI loved the Tarzan movie made by Disney. I have watched it over and over again and will still watch it again because it's a fantastic film. That movie was full of fun and represent the big theme about family. Also, that movie was not complicated at all. When I was a kid, I have always loved Tarzan and the Disney's Tarzan for me, was my favorite Disney film of all time. The soundtrack was also exceptional by Phil Collins. To be honest, I had really high expectations for this movie since the casts are pretty good and the director is known for some of the best harry potter movies. Wow. When I came out of the theater, it did not reach my expectations at all. So this movie doesn't have any connection with the original Disney Tarzan. In fact, none of the story or the background past of Tarzan is the same as the Disney's Tarzan. So if you expect to see a young Tarzan growing up, you will be upset, although they did show some flashbacks about Tarzan's past. But this Tarzan has actually grown up and he wanted to help Congo. So Tarzan and Jane went to Congo with Dr. Williams (Sam L Jackson) to defeat Christoph Waltz. That's basically the plot. The movie wasn't all bad. There are some good parts of it, such as Alexander Skarsgard who plays Tarzan. He did pretty well as he put in work for 9 months to become Tarzan, so he really did put in work for this role. He's an enormous guy and fit Tarzan. I also thought Margot Robbie did fine as Jane. She wasn't all fantastic, but she's just a supporting role of the movie. The flashbacks were also great. But the most fun character was Sam L. Jackson's. God he was hilarious and lively. The bad parts of the movie is basically the plot, the directing, and the villain. The plot included so many things happening that some of them are so irrelevant. The only good part was the 3rd act, which is the only ""Tarzan"" part of the movie. The 1st and 2nd were just leading up to it. If the Trailer showed mostly part of ""Tarzan"", then the rest of the movie is expected to be based on Tarzan in the jungle with the gorillas, but it's not. It was an adult Tarzan with Jane. The build up was so slow. The directing was also not that good. The slow motions just don't work. Only a few does, but there are lots of them. The CGI was poor. I mean it was so noticeable, but the parts when Tarzan swing from trees to trees were handled well. Lastly, Christoph Waltz was just...well... Christoph Waltz. He played this villain like he played any other villains. The movie was supposed to be fun, but they really make it more dramatic than fun. This was not the Tarzan I expected, and Disney's Tarzan is much better than this one. But although it was just alright, as a big fan of Tarzan, I will give props for making a live action Tarzan movie. This movie will get a 7.3/10. Go see it guys, but if you haven't seen Finding Dory, I suggest to watch that first and then watch this. Peace !",The Legend of Tarzan
292,Sgtonearm,Does Tarzan save Jane...again?,6,3 August 2016,"The CLAW here, bringing you another, should you see it in theaters, or wait for the DVD. Here we go: Here we are once again with Tarzan saving the beautiful Jane. A story as old as time, or at least my time. Skarsgard is utterly shredded in this movie, so for ladies who wanted to see that, you wont be disappointed. For guys who wanted to see the future Harley Quinn(Margot Robbie), sorry she's in a 19th century dress the entire time.The good points of this movie are thanks in part to the great Sam Jackson, providing some great comic relief, and a couple great speeches. Other than that, this is your typical run of the mill action movie, with the typical bad guy, or two. I'll say it, Christoph Waltz has run his course as the villain. While watching this movie, all I saw was the same villain he has played but just in a different movie and time period. He comes off with a smooth calming voice, but his subtle movements and gestures suggest otherwise. Djimon Hounsou(Who?(Guardians of The Galaxy reference anyone?)) plays the second villain, hell bent on revenge against Tarzan.Overall, the plot is pretty simplistic, and there is quite a bit of action, but not all of it is great. The glaring problem with this movie is the CGI. Although there are a few scenes where the apes look absolutely great, it looks like that's where all the money went to. When Tarzan and the apes are flying through the trees, it is blatantly obviously, and quite distracting, that they are CGI, and pretty bad to say the least. One of the cooler effects that does look good, is Tarzan's hands. If you look closely, you will notice that they are overly developed, a symptom of him being raised by apes! Recommendation:Wait for the DVD(rental)",The Legend of Tarzan
293,misaege,Tarzan As You've Never Seen Him,8,3 August 2016,"I wasn't sure what to expect...I went to see it with my father-in-law and we both thought it was spectacular. Alexander Skarsgard was chilling, relentless and breathtaking. It was obvious he trained hard to be in tremendous physical condition for this role. Jane was beautifully played by the stunning Australian actress Margot Robbie. The chemistry between the two was undeniable. In addition to Tarzan's role to help determine the impact on the Congo of the Belgian presence, his ""side-kick"" Dr. George Williams (superbly played by Samuel L. Jackson) lent even more credibility to the evidence they gathered. They saw first hand how ruthless the Belgians were to not only try to gain full control of the Congo and enslave thousands of natives in the process, but how greedy they were to get their hands on the diamonds. The scenes with Tarzan and his animal friends were stunning. Christopher Waltz was tremendous as the villain Rom...any time an actor can make you ""hate"" them, they've done their job very well. Overall, we were truly taken by this film. I hope there will be more in the future.",The Legend of Tarzan
294,posti-215-231550,Surprisingly watchable,8,28 July 2019,"I began watching this movie with the thought that I could always stop and hit ""delete"" if it was as awful as it had been described by some. However, while not the best, deepest or most satisfying movie I've ever seen, it was a long, long way from the complete dud I'd expected reading the reviews here. Margot Robbie's Jane was spirited and intelligent, Samuel L Jackson was - well, Samuel L Jackson; that is to say, sardonic, slightly cynical but in the end loyal and decent, with a good dose of humour thrown in. And Skarsgard as Tarzan/John Clayton depicted well enough the man of two opposing cultures, using all the weapons of both in an attempt to save the country he ultimately accepts as being his true home, along with his wife (and if nothing else, looking pretty damn good in the process). And the Tarzan roar is fairly impressive too! Romance, intrigue, action - Shakespeare it may not be, but a pleasant enough way to pass 2 hours all the same.",The Legend of Tarzan

I've always wanted a mature film- version of this great story. I must say that CGI was top-notch. Animals were sharp, landscape colorful and filled with life. But what really surprised was the actual storytelling and the chemistry between the actors. It all was so believable, I forgot I was at the cinema. By the end of this movie I was desperate to find some liana to tag along with Tarzan, it was that immersive. WHile I did enjoy The Jungle Book, this was miles ahead of that one.

To quote many, ""This is the greatest Tarzan film ever made"" I think these people need to calm down and maybe have a little look at Greystoke (a far superior film in every respect).This particular film, to be fair, is OK...nothing more. The story is adequate but the phoney CGI is what really grates with me. It's just pure laziness. From the phoney animals to the phoney swinging onto a moving train scene – it's just utter drivel. It's like a cross between Spiderman 3 and Star Wars Episode 1 but set in a fake green-screen jungle. CGI can be done well (see the bear attack in The Revenant), but this was just thrown together. And that is one of my pet hates of modern cinema – phoney CGI. This has obviously been made, without any craft, for the CGI, bubble-gum for the eyeballs, generation of modern movie goers. Knowing what I know now, I would not have lost out by never seeing this film. If you've never seen a Tarzan film, put on Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes. It is a beautiful, human, haunting, moving picture which does the Tarzan legend justice!",The Legend of Tarzan
297,Glewe,"Nope, this is not Tarzan",2,16 July 2016,"I read through a bunch of the 10-stars reviews here glorifying this movie as the bets Tarzan there is. I really had to get into me asking myself if I am so wrong with my verdict. Well, I stick with it. This is one of the worst Tarzan movies I have seen.Let me elaborate a bit. It is not the movie itself that I don't like. The cinematographic craftsmanship is great. Camera, lighting, cut, scenery and great supporting acting (Christoph Waltz is excellent again) speak for the movie. But that is not the reason why I went to see it.I went to the theatre to get a great Tarzan experience. And this movie fails badly. Since a kid I am a Tarzan fan. I saw so many movies including the early ones with Johnny Weissmueller and Lex Barker. They had what I call a Tarzan charisma. Something that Alexander Skarsgard does not have at all. Nope, he is no Tarzan, has nothing of him. A good actor but surely no Tarzan.The story line is very disappointing. I felt fooled. It is so trivial and easy to predict. It is not ERB's Tarzan tale filled with some additions here and there, it is a stereotype action story filled with some Tarzan tale pieces here and there.No, this movie fails badly as a Tarzan movie. There is no ""Tarzan"" in it and no ""Tarzan tale"" either.",The Legend of Tarzan
298,openminded1313,The literary Tarzan; more or less,7,12 February 2017,"This is one of the few movies that show the ""literary Tarzan"", i.e. the Tarzan that Edgar Rice Burroughs envisioned- ""Lord Greystoke"". This movie shows has a pretty good character development; which is an absolute necessity in order to believe that he can communicate with the gorillas (how he can communicate with the lions, ostriches, and other animals is not made clear in this movie). The scenery shots are marvelous and give the viewer an idea of how beautiful this part of Africa is and why historical European settlers did go there; despite the hardships involved. Having praised this movie I must also state that one should remember that it is still a work of fiction that borders on fantasy. Tarzan is shown as a ""feral"" human; raised by animals. This has happened a few times in reality but the child inevitably grows up mentally disabled; sort of like putting a Stephen Hawking intellect in a freshman class in high school and not allowing him to progress to a higher grade ;-). To get around that suspension of disbelief some critics have pointed out that Lord Greystoke was raised by a group of advanced apes that had a language-so he could develop mentally. Well, perhaps.....""Jane"" -the marvelous actress Margaret Robbie- was never portrayed as a ""damsel in distress"" to begin with, and in this movie she is no exception. A great performance is given by her; she almost steals the show from Tarzan. Though the movie shows the Tarzan that Burroughs envisioned; it does not show the Africa Congo as depicted in the novels. Instead the movie shows what is usually referred to as ""The Congo Free State""; a still controversial era. Burroughs probably knew about this matter but due to the lack of specific information about this period (a situation that still exists today) he kept the depiction of Africa more ""generic"". This movie shows the European government as the ""bad guy"" with Tarzan being the ""good guy"". Anyway, just remember, it is fiction with even the location being fictitious (filming was actually done in Gabon; not the Congo).",The Legend of Tarzan
299,Racetrip,Barbie Syfy Tarzan,1,26 September 2016,"Worst gorilla CGI ever, Borderline Syfy channel, and a rip off from Planet of the Apes. Tarzan is a male version of Sheena, too clean and neat looking. The blond hair looks as if Tarzan just came out of a bang novel from Barbie. A disgusting joke below the belt is served by an African American, as usual, which is somewhat racist if you think about it. There is absolutely no skin shown on women, but quite a bit of men - especially Tarzan. Total objectifying men with unrealistic role models. Tarzan as a young boy is running around naked covered in mud, so no actual nudity is actual shown. The story is very weak and you feel as if you just wasted nearly two hours of your life. Overly predictable with no real element of suspense. Disney could have done so much better than Warner bros. did with this version of Tarzan.",The Legend of Tarzan
300,yt-278-797014,A missing fantasy world without the beauty of brutality,8,28 August 2016,"The story of Tarzan is more a tragedy in today's world. It is a sad time where we rape nature, destroy balance and revel in our destruction. When I used to read ERB's books, it did transport me to fantasy land. A land where everything was in harmony. In balance. In sync. Where the circle of life was complete. This movie, did remind me of our rapacious nature. It signaled the unstoppable nature of human appetite for destruction. But as a standalone move, it could have been better.I read somewhere in trivia that Tarzan was a superhero. Well, not exactly with super powers, but definitely super human. He was supposed to have these extraordinary capabilities. He had been able to even defeat the great apes. The story teller or the director may have wanted to show the vulnerable or weaker side of him, but to me that was not Tarzan. For him to be defeated physically, his foe would have had to also been subject to character development. Tarzan is a character that is meant to challenge our physicality. If it were intelligence, I would go for, off the top of my head, 12 Angry Men, JRRT's LOTR and Peter Jackson for imagination, Star Wars for effects. I would have really liked to see Tarzan fighting and winning physical fights. At the end of the day, Tarzan won. Simply because of his brute force in the sensitive universe of Africa. Not politicking. I hope the next story stays in the glorious fantasy world of ERB and brings out the physicality of Tarzan with a poignant touch. We don't really need realism here, but brutality. I want to see magnificent fighting. I want a contrast of nature with our modernity. I want the star of the movie to be Nature, her beauty and what might have been. PS. It may have been interesting to see why Tarzan transitioned from nudity to loin cloth/pants!",The Legend of Tarzan
301,BoundingSlinky,Forgettable in every way,4,29 August 2016,"Tarzan, the half man half animal with his iconic cry has been immortalized in movies for numerous times, most know for its Disney adaptation. This time Tarzan comes to the movie screen in a live action adaptation directed by David Yates ( know for the later Harry Potter movies) starring Alexander Skarsard, Margot Robbie, Samuel L. Jackson and Christoph Waltz. So What's not to be exited for? Well a lot.While the classic story of Tarzan might have been adapted many times before, the decisions of the writers to make a story after the well known legend, caught me off guard from the beginning of the movie. Don't go into this movie expecting the classic story of Tarzan because you will only get flashes of it by way of flashbacks (pun indented). While the use of flashbacks may be effective, it seems in The Legend of Tarzan desperately tries to explain certain other actions in the movie by way of these flashbacks, but they come off as off-beat. The real story in the movie is pretty far fetched and the intentions of Christoph Waltz's characters to lure Tarzan back to Africa are almost as ridiculous as the CGI and green-screen effects in the movie. Maybe it is because of the beautiful CGI works as the new Jungle Book, Gravity etc. Recently, but during this movie I was continuously getting frustrated by recognizing the usage of green-screen and CGI. Skarsgard does however succeed at portraying a convincing Tarzan. The other performances are all good to okay: Robbie continues to convince me being a well-rounded actress while Christoph Waltz continues to raise the question if he is only really good in Tarantino pictures. While L. Jackson is fun to watch at, he gave me kind of the impression of just screwing around and making himself have as much fun as possible because he saw immediately that this film wasn't that good to begin with. Basically this movie is another summer blockbuster movie, without having any purpose apart from making money. While the action in the movie does enough to not make fall asleep, it ultimately falls way short. Hopefully Yates doesn't fall short again with the next movie in the Harry Potter universe.5,5/10 Verdict: Forgettable in every way",The Legend of Tarzan

Too many people concentrated on the movie CGI or other Hollywood concerns. Let's talk storyline.EVERY movie previously attempted to tell the story of young Tarzan meets Jane. This daring telling attempts to address Lord Greystoke returning to face past challenges under the umbrella of his new life.I enjoyed the balance associated with the refined Lord retuning to his roots. Who doesn't have challenges doing that? But this character slowly migrated from Lord back to Tarzan without losing connection with either. His catalyst: you messed with my family!!! It wasn't for revenge, it wasn't for money...it was based in his motivation; animalistic impulse if you will. Holding true to his history as an ""animal"" bs ""man"" conflict.Agreed some side stories were stretched. But the heart of the story was ""Tarzan saves Jane"". I believe this is in keeping with the core characterization of Tarzan throughout the many iterations over the decades or representations.Too many reviews I've read are concerned with the deviation from previous tellings. I believe this was the point of this movie. ""What if Tarzan went home"".All together. I think this is a great take and extension of the ""Legend of Tarzan"".

He looks nothing like Tarzan.
He's just been cast because he was a popular among the girls at the time the movies was made.
Like if the producer wanted to make Tarzan popular amongst girls.
But Tarzan has allways been a man the boys looked op to. Someone the boys wanted to be. Just like James Bond or Superman ect.There have been severel actors who had the right face to portray Tarzan:
Frank Merrill, Buster Crabbe, Lex Barker, Miles O'keefe ect.
Since the early 80' there seems to be a kind of idea that Tarzan should look like a young poprock star!
But thats not how Tarzan looks.
Tarzan is a full grown man, not a young popstar. If you wanna know how Tarzan has to look in the movies, then look at the comics by Bourne Hogarth and Russ Manning.

You can get away with cliché dialogue, two dimensional characters and unrealistic stunts in a cartoon, because...... well, because it's a cartoon and the audience knows it's not real from the start. An animated film gives the director a certain amount of creative license so that he/she may stretch the boundaries of what is physically possible without us all shouting 'Hey that's ridiculous'.

The movie was filed in a studio in England and they attempted to ""back drop"" Africa into it. But it looks awful; meaning the green screen work is so bad. I've seen better work in cable TV. The CG work is pathetic. The scene with the animals trampling the army village near the end looks like little computer generated rabbits. The proportions don't work. And then there is Samuel Jackson. What a terrible casting job. He's old (yeah, I get it, can't say that, but its true), yet he's supposed to be keeping up with Tarzan running through the jungle. It doesn't work. It's not realistic. It looks fake. He looks like he should be in a wheel chair. Combined that with some angles where he's running on air because the green screen doesn't match. What an absolute pathetic attempt.

I've been a fan of Tarzan since childhood - I grew up on the Johnny Weismuller movies and I read the books. I'm a definite fan and harsh critic of bad Tarzan movies. That being said, there are a few things you expect of a Tarzan movie: swinging through the trees, hanging/fighting great apes, swimming, romancing/rescuing Jane. This movie hit those points and did a great job. To add to that, it was the closest to Burroughs accurate of any of them. There may have been some cheesy dialogue and a one dimensional bad guy, but there was also a bad guy who could see reason and IT'S A FREAKING TARZAN MOVIE!!

The whole reason for Tarzan going back is quickly forgotten, also skipped over is how he has been able to grasp English so quickly! There is hardly any chemistry between Tarzan and Jane, which isn't helped by fairly wooden acting. Jackson and Waltz try to pull the film up, but both are below par in this remake. There are lots of CGI shots, which may be good in 3D, but don't really work on a normal screen. The story jumps around, and you never really get caught by it. The ending is particularly poor, with animals able to identify the bad people, and and impossible survival of an explosion.

I did not like the character in the white suit. I wanted to put my fist in his face myself. Saw him before with Brad Pitt in WW-II movie as an SS colonel (""Inglorious Bastards"" and I hated him there too. Jane was beautiful and next to Tarzan they would make a nice couple in real life.

But it's a story about a man who controls jungle animals and swings from vines, so its going to look unbelievable at points. However, I found a good chunk (about 85% IMO) relied on realistic scenery, makeup and special effects. I mean... they're not going to use real gorillas or lions with the actors, but the CGI ones looked really good and will have you mesmerized by the detail.

You have to remember this is the Legend of Tarzan, so don't expect tons of character development, but I think they made a nice balance. The film was really enjoyable to watch and I left it wanting to enthusiastically discuss it with my mate. What more can you ask for? If you grew up reading adventure stories, then this just brings those stories to life.

I can tell that Skarsgaard and Waltz are excellent actors who could have showcased their talents with better material. I tried not to be bored, but failed at every attempt. It wasn't for lack of trying. I tried to enjoy the film, but the totality of the story was flat - no peaks, no valleys - a flat-line, though Skarsgaard and Waltz were excellent cast- mates. I can't fault them; however, Margot Robbie did not fit. First of all, she needs elocution lessons. I couldn't understand a word she said, though I could understand the ESL Swedish and German actors quite well. She must be an exponent of the Brando school.

A good score well recorded would have injected far more emotion into certain scenes, all the music does is make us feel like we're in a quirky clothes store watching plastic mannequins stare at each other.Their accents are all over the place, sometimes they sound American which was confusing but Alexander Skarsgård took it to a whole new level by creating a new accent called ""Iricanglish"".The green screen effects are way too obvious and the CGI looked like Playstation 3 cut scenes which totally ruined any potential for immersion. In the tree jumping scene there were shots where Tarzan and Samuel L Jackson had no shadows, light effects were pointing the wrong way and the layers were poorly blended. The train scenes looked looked worse than an episode of ""Thomas The Tank Engine"" and somebody forgot to put water on the steam boat paddles. Any scenes with multiple animals in shot looked awful due to poor blending and the fact the animals all looked the same. It looks like they created and animated one animal then just hit ""copy & paste"" for the rest.Basically to summarise, the whole thing feels rushed, lazy and like a TV movie.

High-quality CG surprisingly convey the lie of hair and even emotion.・Comfortable African sounds・Spectacular African landscape. I would recommend that you see this film on the big screen.■Negative---Story・Ⅰ wanted to know why Tazan leave the jungle and moved to England (Next version?).---Character・Tarzan is cool rather than wild. When he tried to get back Jane, he should even wilder. If Gorilias' children are abducted by people, Gorillas must get crazy and lose their temper. I felt that Tazan was a calm and cool human when Jane was abducted.・When Gollilas gathered at Tazan (when African with white powder attacked Tazan), the Africans did not grasp the correct position of Gorillas. They did not get set up spears against Gorillas. It was a little bit funny.",The Legend of Tarzan
324,eranlevy,"Excellent story, excellent implementation",9,12 July 2016,"I don't understand the low critics score for this movie. I hesitated whether to join friends and watch it because of that score, and I'm glad I did. User reviews here, which are mostly very positive, reflect much better the value of this movie.First, the story is original and interesting. I liked the fact that it starts off with Tarzan already well established at England, and later gives parts of the original story via flashback. This works very well and is a refreshing view to the well famous tale.Cast did an excellent job through most of the scenes. Scenery and camera work are good too. I watched in IMAX, and some scenes were breath taking. CGI is mostly of a high quality, animals remind the remarkable work done in the Jungle Book this year, but in some scenes their behavior was not convincing enough.So it's not perfect, but overall it's a good and very recommended experience that should be watched on the big screen.",The Legend of Tarzan
325,jplescha,"Great story, good movie.",7,17 July 2016,"Overall I liked the movie because I like the Story of Tarzan and any opportunity to get exposed to it in the big screen is a good day.This time around, the visuals the acting the sets, the story the intrigue and the animal undertone lurking were all there. So very good in that Regard!Where this movie loses is I believe in the editing part again, it seems some bureaucratic force decided to chop the movie in order to fit some arbitrary and non artistic format. Which is disappointing. Was it done to fit the movie within a certain time frame or because they wanted to try to have the ""Action"" be more intense it its delivery we may never know but it causes holes in the story and there were many moments I was wonder ""what has happened here?"" and ""how did A lead to C, where is B?"". At times it felt dry and without Spirit without Magic.And I am hoping this chopping of movies will stop.What was not very poignant too was the music score, I do not remember it at all, and maybe this is also a contributor to the lack of magic, there was no score causing that heart pounding feeling. Other than this, I think the movie makes for an entertaining afternoon and a nice new iteration to the story of Tarzan and his Legend :)",The Legend of Tarzan
326,threeleggedant,Entertaining,7,31 October 2021,"At first I didn't really take to this as it was a bit heavy on the CGI, but the more I watched it, the more I enjoyed it. As a kid in the 1970s, there were loads of movies about deepest, darkest, Africa with scary creatures, quicksand, and man-eating plants (I kid you not) and I used to throughly enjoy them in those simpler times when there were only three TV channels here in the UK.This movie has mediocre CGI, but then I remembered that the special effects of all those 1950s movies that I used to watch were also dreadful and you filled in the defects with your imagination.This moving is a continuation of that genre of movies set in Africa that just doesn't seem to get made these days, and it was all the more enjoyable for it.",The Legend of Tarzan

From there, I don't know how but someway the director lost the sense of direction. Growing up, we learned the legend of Tarzan as someone who is special to the jungle not politics. Someway, i can understand director's choice of bringing an American black fellow into the mix of slavery. But, if you are going to make him central, give him strong content. With this i come to Tarzan, GIVE TARZAN SOME STRONG CONTENT. All i saw was a person mixed in a lot of stories, had no clue about other characters, was trying to be part of a lot of clan/tribe/family. This, this movie right here is a disrespect to the legend of Tarzan. And this comes from a fan of both Yates and Tarzan.",The Legend of Tarzan

It used to be Leopold's private property until 1908. The Belgium government (led by a socialist van der Velde) was not very happy about this: Leopold had promised to the parliament his adventure in the ""African Congo"" as the movie for American ignoramuses says. (Do you know of any other Congo than the African one? Not me.)Belgium was the 8th economic power at that time and not because of the Congo at all but because of its coal, steel and other industries (trams, trains, electric power stations, textiles) and its trade with Central Europe and the Russian Empire. Belgium turned to Congo after the WWI and the lost of the Central European and Russian Empire markets. But Congo never was a profitable as those old markets (no one in Congo to buy anything).Oh, and the CGI really bores me.",The Legend of Tarzan

Now this movie is worst beyond words...specially if you ever watched Lord Graystoke. Anyways American annoying Jane, invented characters, change of the story, honestly regret paying a ticket for this. Bottom line so bad I had to leave, had not done this since the Garfield movie years ago. Like, the guy that plays Tarzan, was pretty decent but this crappy Hollywood versions is BAD. Maybe the name should be, inspired in Tarzan, but we didn't even bothered to read the book, comics or any material"". Plus is annoying all this CGI movies, I would say old movies were more realistic.

331,sebastian-wallin-pederse,Modernized means stupefied and simplified,5,30 June 2017,The movie was an 2 hours long and with a awful plot and crappy CGI. At no point in this movie did you feel attached to the actors and would not have cared if they died or not. The plot was shallow and predictable. Several scenes had no relevance to the plot and should be excluded such as the butterfly scene. Some scenes should have been longer so you would learn the characters but that didn't happen and you end up following a plot with no character development and mediocre entertainment and a lot of irritation by the plot and badly performed scenes. Tarzan or is it Captain America i'm still not sure because Tarzan defiantly has some over-natural powers since he can stand after being beaten by a 300kg giant ape monster!! Samual L. Jackson is the worst actor throughout the movie. He doesn't fit in and does no effort in adapting. He acts as if this was a Tarantino movie. Not to mention how a black man from the U.S could become a diplomat!?The apes are not realistically made at all and you do at no time feel they're scary but only extremely aggressive. I think the way Jane acted in this movie showed how pathetic the movie is and if i haven't told you yet Jane is American!! not even English as she should have been! The way she acts when she finds Tarzan is highly unrealistic unless she is very promiscuous because normally you would flee and by NO WAY LET A STRANGER TOUCH YOU!!I felt the many unrealistic scenes and the absolute lack of realism. I will never see this movie again and i can't recommend it.,The Legend of Tarzan
332,eberthume,The Legend of Okay,6,28 July 2016,"The Legend of Tarzen is a movie that I was kinda looking forward to, I mean it's directed by David Yates the same guy who did the second half of the Harry Potter films and there aren't many mature adaptations of Tarzan. First and foremost, this movie is by no means a bad movie, it's just not a great one. I'm going to list the pros and cons as follows.Pros. Samaul L Jackson was hilarious and EASILY the best part about the movie. Margot Robbie is good and INSANELY hot. It had a nice adventure feel and the action scenes where overall enjoyable.Cons. THE SGI SUCKED! It was REALLY bad and used EVERYWHERE! There's one shot showing Tarzan swinging on a train and it was laughable. Alexander Skargaurd was okay as Tarzan he was just kinda stiff and boring. The music was forgettable. The story was kinda mediocre, not bad, but not that good. Christophe Waltz was fine as the main villain, he was by no means bad, but he just wasn't that memorable or entertaining. Honestly the only two movies that he does really well in, is Inglorious Basterds and Django. Also the movie has these weird slow-motion shots that were just awkward and laughable. And the CGI WAS SOOOO BADDD!!!!Overall it's not Horrible, it's entertaining enough to make it possible to deal with the CGI and the occasional stiff line delivered by Alexander. The main reason why I think you can go and see this movie and still have some fun is because of Samaul L Jackson, he's the only part of the movie that I genuinely loved.",The Legend of Tarzan
333,craigfs-17680,Low expectations and a surprising movie,8,11 July 2016,"I went into the cinema for this was my birthday outing. (IMAX 3D=expensive) and my expectations were fairly conservative.I had watched a couple of early Youtube reviews purposely to gauge the general opinions of those who dabble in that type of thing and I am pleased that I did because aside from a couple of ropey CGI moments the movie is very well paced and unlike some of the reviewers I think the action,although not mindless and without purpose actually fitted nicely into the direction of a very familiar but detailed and well told story.Without giving too much away Tarzan,or Lord Grey- stoke as he is formerly known is already living in London and part of polite society after his upbringing in the jungles of Africa so the story starts from that point and what follows after that is a fairly intelligent telling of his return to the jungle and the obvious fight to reconnect with his heritage and save the woman he loves while trying to save the amazon people from slavery.Throw in CGI animals,swinging vines,a decent paced adventure and a 1920's mousstache twirling villain and you pretty much have a Tarzan movie.BTW it's got Samuel L Jackson too in a much needed comic relief role.Enjoy! P.s.The way the African landscape is portrayed is eye popping and look incredible.",The Legend of Tarzan

This Tarzan movie has better action, drama and humour, it has a good story-line. it's a surprise that this one is live action, as the other 2 originals including the 2014 one are cartoon. what's the point in-that, I still liked this one better as it is live action and when it comes to live action the action and drama is always better. the way this movie went, well surprisingly it was catchy gripping and not expected. The violence was pretty intense not too bloody but what would u expect as it is set in the jungle which can be very dangerous. The Legend Of Tarzan, is a one to watch its enjoyable, and highly recommended for those who want the action somewhere else, than just on the streets.I give this movie a 7/10 because I do feel like it could of been a little better with the action and it was looking back at flashbacks mostly.anyways The Legend Of Tarzan, keeps you on the edge of your seat and will not disappoint you.",The Legend of Tarzan

Imagine a world where man and beast have respect for one another. Imagine a world where SAMUEL .L. JACKSON does not utter the the words ""MOTHER F---ker.""or ""GOD DAMN MOTHER F---ER"" Great movie despite the reviews calling it gray and dreary.Yes it is gray despite the backdrop of the wilderness of Africa.Could have been shot in Vivid mode . Was it dreary?I don't think so .The movie went back and forth explaining how Tazan came to be.There are a lot of people under 20 that did not see the Disney movie or George of the jungle(Mmmmm Brendan Fraser when he was ripped)So they explain it through flashback.Worked for me. Alexander Skarsgard is a really good Tarzan (sorry, Brendan Fraser).A bit moody,almost one dimensional till he got his gear off.Then he came to life.Could smiled a bit more too.Thank god they didn't get him to beat his chest and yodel Ala Johnny Weissmuller.There was yodel ling of a kind but more as a background jungle type noise. Christopher Waltz was at his creepy best .I would love to see him where he is not vile(Inglorious Barstards) or devious(Django).Loved him in both of those films.I must see his other movies.One day..... Samuel .L.Jackson was brilliant .Funny.Should have chucked a couple of them God Damn Mother f--k-en snakes at him though. Margot Robbie was also good,Thank god she didn't play the squealing Damsel in Distress more like Keira Knightley in Pirates of the Caribbean.You go girl.Provided you treat this as strictly popcorn entertainment, then there's plenty to enjoy here, particularly some terrific special effects. Would have looked good as a 3d movie with all that swinging back and forth through the trees.Some say this film is antiquated ,that it still shows a white man saving the oppressed Africans and the damsel in distress.But i didn't see it like that.It was a story written a long time ago and is just being retold .Went to Reading to see the 6 pm screening and thank god we got there early.It was chock a block and walking out pass the huge line to see the next session.Cheap tickets,cheap popcorn and comfortable seats .",The Legend of Tarzan

337,napouser,why the hate?,9,23 October 2016,true masterpiece. i have no idea why people hate this. direction is obviously good enough in fact some times its so obviously hardworking that takes over the role of script and plot. that's essentially what direction should be. the ability to tell a story without words. so lets say if the character wants to kill someone or feels this and that he doesn't need to say it because the direction will take care of saying it visuals or editing or zoom or traveling etc. there are movies out there with minimal amount of words and they are still allow u to understand things that are happening it can be something subtle like a movement or a wince or something so yea if u are looking for a woody Allen film where every feeling has to be expressed like a Mexican soap opera don't see Tarzan.if u are looking for true cinematography however yea this is it usually the first 5 minutes of a movie are enough to see if its gonna be good or not. watch how in this particular it leads to the main character and the title.second thing is the editing. usually in bad productions that are just a bunch of money piled up for expensive actors and effects the editing is simple. take marvel for example lets say hmm ... ant-man for instance. editing is simple and boring a talks a angle b talks b angle . lots of cuts to up suspense during action and that's it here editing is complicated. some shots are long some times angle is different than the guy talking. why? well maybe we are not interested in what the guy says but the reaction to what he says also for a movie that is all CG action and popcorn there is a lot of slow paced weird shots for specific reasons. also a hard choice for this kind of movie.stunning visuals. apart from nature and stuff that are above even LOTR levels the camera does wonders. close ups when needed weird angles and difficult lenses . again take a standard mainstream movie of your usual 200mill ant-man/avengers/Thor/whatever.standard shots 90 degrees everything in focus frame always balanced all in order. cinematography IS NOT evolved whatsoever in the story is like u are going to the theater to see a f$#ng play!!!in Tarzan however even the most typical simple scene ... i dunno ... some guy meets an other guy and they talk ... o my god weird frames half faces weird angles of the camera ... then the camera is always moving silently to build suspension. just look at the opening scene. and of course in 90% of the shots very little is in focus everything else is blurry. why? well that's the job of the cinematographer to give u what u supposed to be seeing and hide everything else. i mean clear and full shots are good when u see animals attacking the town but why the hell u need them when the two protagonists talk. so if lets say Jane and Tarzan have a dispute we care about the dispute not about the house that they are in. the result is that most shots are blurry houses and England are dark and almost nothing visible like brightness is to 0.that's how u create atmosphereas far as the protagonists well they are not the perfect actors but who gives a sh$%#*t its Tarzan anyway,The Legend of Tarzan
338,nanstamps,The Legend of Tarzan is the Best Version of Tarzan Ever,10,1 July 2016,"Have you ever wondered why there are so many versions of Tarzan? I read the original Edgar Rice Burroughs book a decade ago because I wanted to know what the real version was. The book was a Penny Dreadful that was fun as heck, silly as all get out, and pretty skewed from reality (Tarzan teaches himself to read from a book he found in his dead parents tree house and he can do that because he's of Nobel birth) LOLThis new version of Tarzan not only tries to make it as realistic as it can be in the circumstances (it is a super hero jungle guy), it also incorporates history of the time (turn of the 19th Century) by having the villains be the Belgians in the Congo. The Legend of Tarzan takes the legend and makes it a better story.The stars of the movie are all fantastic in their roles. Alexander Skarsgard is beyond buff, beautiful and an amazing Tarzan. Margot Robbie is sweet and tough as nails as Jane. Samuel L. Jackson is always good but this part would be less without him. Christoph Waltz was very villainy and believable.Thank you to all the people who made this movie, for thinking we needed yet another Tarzan. Now I want a sequel.",The Legend of Tarzan

Was glad to see they got the Mangani right for a change. Even if you know nothing of Burroughs books I think you would enjoy this movie. The actor portrayed Tarzan as he should be portrayed. Not some stupid grunting idiot but a Lord in his own right in London as well as in the jungle. The closest any movie before this came to portraying him as he should be was Greystoke. This movie far surpasses it. The animals were very believable as were the natives. The jungle scenes were breathtaking and I was so glad to see Jane as feisty as she was in the books. Jane is no simple damsel in distress. She is Lady Greystoke, and mate to Tarzan.",The Legend of Tarzan

The writing is bad enough that I can't really take too much fault with the actors. They were given a dreadful script to work with and this was clearly just a payday for several of them. Samuel Jackson's character as the sidekick comic relief was dreadful, especially when they repeatedly tried to change gears and make him the moral standard bearer. Was horribly disappointed with Christopher Waltz's role. I think he's a fine, fine actor, but again, not much to work with here. As for 'Tarzan' and 'Jane'... meh. Nice to look at, but zero depth, despite the ham handed efforts of the screenplay to provide them with some. I will say that it's a gorgeous movie in terms of sets and costuming, but the CGI got to be way too much. Wait for video.

What's not to love? I've grown up a fan of the Tarzan/Jane love story. I watched the Johnny Weismuller versions as a girl, and enjoyed the cartoon Disney with my kids. But I admit to always hoping for a well-done cinematic modern-take on the story, and this one delivered quite well. The on-screen chemistry between the two leads sizzles, Nick Fury (because he's not really Samuel L. Jackson to some of us) follows through a believable hero, and the back-story of Tarzan's growing-up years was well-placed and smoothly worked in to the overall story.Loved it.",The Legend of Tarzan

The CGI is so over the top it spoils what could of been a good movie into a waste of time. Sorry but it gets two thumbs down from me.The guy they chose to be Tarzan was built like a weed compared to what you would expect. The camera angles used to hide this got lost in translation. The real Tarzan would of snapped this modern day version into two. The only thing missing from this Tarzan was his pink umbrella.

343,AlpenglowMemories,"Tarzan is a beautifully-shot, hearty adventure film",8,21 July 2016,"Creating a contemporary Tarzan film is a bold idea. The critical reaction hit the film hard, many reviews suggesting that the iconic ape-man's time had passed. Tarzan is a character steeped in problematic history. He's a white superman fighting his way across the African continent; a relic of the colonialist era. It's understandable why he might incite such hostility. And yet, 2016's 'The Legend of Tarzan' does everything in its power to modernise the archaic idea. Tarzan of 2016 is less supreme white-superman, and more a conflicted individual, torn between two realities.David Yates' follow-up to his Potter films has something that many films in the current cinemascape are lacking: a heart, and a sense of uniqueness. Superhero films battle for box office supremacy, but there isn't another movie around currently that feels like The Legend of Tarzan. And, unlike so many other films this year, the film practices brevity. The Legend of Tarzan is good, solid adventure entertainment. It takes classic story elements and adds a modern twist to them: Jane fills the 'damsel' role, but is far more fiery and psychologically complex. Samuel L Jackson plays George Washington-Williams, a real- life figure who finds himself an investigator, hearty companion and fierce gunslinger. Waltz fulfills the villain role. His Leon Rom is perfectionist, heartless and ambitious. It's a role that might feel familiar for the actor, but it works well enough.Skarsgard's take on Tarzan is, perhaps, the most book-accurate in the history of the character. He is well-educated and refined. He can play the English lord. But Skarsgard's Tarzan finds himself conflicted about himself; there's a heaviness that weighs on the character about returning to Africa. He has no 'real' home. The performance is very subdued with only two scenes of primal rage showing through. The rest of the time Skarsgard practices minimalism.Part of the modernisation is the film utilising the Congo Free State, Belgium's oppressive regime of the Congolese people. The film meticulously recreates the costumes and details of the period (such as a train pulling hundreds of elephants tusks into Port Boma). Underneath the summer glamour, Legend of Tarzan touches upon themes of family, respecting the environment, and the damage of destroying connections between people.David Yates brings a particular aesthetic to the film. His sweeping Africa shots are beautifully captured, using real Congolese locations. Other parts of the film, such as the jungle interiors, were shot on soundstages, yet they remain impressive and imposing, finding a sense of earthy magic. There is a subtle grandeur in these environments, not quite real, slightly exaggerated, yet believable. Action scenes make distinct use of slow motion. And elsewhere the camera finds itself focusing on macro shots and close ups: there is a moving abstraction to Yates' direction, he finds powerful images in small details – eyes, hands, cutlery, ants.Despite having a number of exciting action sequences, and an impressive climax, 'Legend of Tarzan' finds a brilliant heart in the dynamic between its cast members, in the heightened reality that Yates captures through his lenses, and the sense of wonder both on a huge scale (epic jungle or Savannah shots) and an extremely intimate level. The flashbacks are woven into the narrative fabric with grace – and without alarm. Yates simply transitions us into them, without fanfare, exploring Tarzan's traumatic history. One excellent moment shows Tarzan brought to the Kuba village for the first time after having protected Jane from an irate gorilla. The transition begins with a shot pulling out away from Tarzan, showing the climatic mountain reflected in the window. Jane's voice is heard. After the flashback we cut from close ups of Tarzan to a close up of Jane, contemplating. The shot lasts awhile. It's moments like this that stress the love and importance between the two leads, and reveals the subtle beauty and meaning with which David Yates imbues his cinema.'Legend of Tarzan' failed to win over the critics. Its well- intentioned script might still hold problematic racial politics. And yet, it is a worthy film, entertaining and well-made. This could be the last cinematic outing for the legendary character. It seems fitting, to me, that he has finally been given a rewarding effort.",The Legend of Tarzan

Sometimes I just want to watch an engaging film that makes me smile in the same way other old school adventure films do (Star Wars, the Indiana Jones flicks, etc.).This unique adaptation of Tarzan is the best one I've seen even if it doesn't follow Edgar Rice Burroughs's series.

The way the director portrayed the relationship between Tarzan and Jane was lovely, and Samuel Jackson was the perfect comic relief for the plot line.

For starters it is the first time I have seen this concept taken out of the children's realm and made into an actual adventure, romance movie, and by the way it is not an animation either. It is an unconventional adventure story of Tarzan from a new and unique prospective I have never seen before, with a twist. As soon as the movie started I knew this was going to be different, it got my attention and I couldn't stop.

Mediocre acting at best. One dimensional characters. No plot. Ridiculous story twists. I wish IMDb would allow me to use the strong language that comes to mind... Watched it on SKY, I want my money back!! arrrrrghhhhhhhhh",The Legend of Tarzan
351,narciscosminblue,You will like this Tarzan,9,10 July 2016,"Hey, I just have seen today (10th of July 2016) 'The Legend of Tarzan' movie, and what can I say, I really enjoyed it. The main story is very good, the actors perform well, it has action, adventure, drama, and a real Tarzan in my opinion. I think Alexander Skarsgard deserve to be Tarzan, because he fits like a glove on this role. The other actors also perform well (Samuel L. Jackson for example). I think you will not get bored at this movie, it's 3D, the animals depicted in this movie are well made, and the environments too (if they are not real, I don't know). Well, the movie is very nice, maybe you will like it too. The 3D is also good, I don't have anything to say, I'm not that good at reviews, but I tell again that you will like it.",The Legend of Tarzan

You people will find racism in absolutely anything just so you have something to get sanctimonious about. The rest of us don't take any notice of the colour of characters, and the story of Tarzan is older than all of you. It's a fun, captivating action film. Don't go expecting depth and existentialism. Grab your popcorn, put your feet up and expect to be entertained for a couple of hours. All in all, I don't feel the film could be improved in any way, it's told with an original story arc and the director knows how to leave you wanting more rather than over facing you with what they think you want to see. Enjoy!",The Legend of Tarzan
353,tomkirkman,"Boring, waste of time.. just skip this one",1,3 July 2016,"Having read several positive reviews of this film, I came to the cinema with a huge expectation. During the first half an hour, I can still bear watching n trying to grasp the essence of all this hero-like epic.After that, I just shook my head and often yawned. The story-line is dragging like a never-ending lullaby. Although acting is well within grasp, but the action & CGI should have been better. I think my popcorn was so much better in textures and taste rather than the film I watched. Considering the big budget, I'm quiet disappointed with the end-result.",The Legend of Tarzan

This movie had some good animals but needed more real ones. This movie also had a pretty good jungle scene.This movie may be for some people, who have never seen Tarzan movies, but this movie might also be entertaining for people who have not see him.As you notice I'm never going to mention the name of this movie I'm just going to call it This Movie because those are the rules on IMDb, rite???",The Legend of Tarzan
355,alex-06662,Quite a Mixed Bag :/,4,15 July 2016,"I went into the cinema to see The Legend of Tarzan with a lot of excitement as it is one of my favourite stories and although I was not expecting it to match the original animation I did expect more from Universal with such a massive budget.Pro's1. The cinematography and the depiction of Africa is stunning in this film and at times breathtaking, easily the highlight of the film. As cheesy as the scene where Tarzan meets the lions he has known since they were cubs is, it was beautiful to watch.2. Overall Alexander Skarsgard was pretty good as a very civilised Tarzan and his back and forth with Samuel L Jackson were enjoyable.3. I enjoyed how the various tribes and locals were portrayed and i found them to be my favourite human characters in the film.Con's1. What did they do to Jane? She was no longer British and I found her quite annoying and despite making the comment about not wanting to be ""like a damsel"" it was all her character seemed to me. She was always the character needing saved whether in the flash back or because she is kidnapped and then when she does break free in the jungle she is immediately captured and her actions end up leading to the deaths of multiple ape's. Margot Robbie was fine in her performance, especially when interacting with the local tribes, but I just disliked the character. 2. Christoph Waltz playing the exact same character yet again, yawn.3. Paper thin plot at no point did I ever think any of the main characters were in trouble.4. The Lack of action did not help a very slow paced movie and it just never seemed to get going.5. When there was action I was surprised at the very obvious CG and the fact it was so obviously not Alexander Skarsgard swinging at points completely took me out of the movie because it was so poor.Overall while there were some positives and a few redeeming factors the film was in general rather boring. It felt much longer than it's run-time and with a budget this massive I expected so much more.",The Legend of Tarzan
356,Diana_G11,"Son of Man, a man in time you'll be (c)",6,23 September 2016,"I can characterize this movie as a pretty typical adventure film. There was too much CGI for me in showing the nature, animals and movements on the vines – as for the rest the visual aspect it was OK. I can actually say neither super bad nor anything good about the actors' play, except for Christoph Waltz who was pretty good as always although he did not seem showing us anything new and fresh that we hadn't seen in his previous roles. Samuel L. Jackson plays an ardent fighter against slavery and racial prejudice, but the script itself doesn't depict this hero clearly and profoundly, and therefore his character does not cause much delight.In general, there're two main things that make me give the film only 6 points. Firstly, all the characters are poorly depicted from the very beginning. And secondly, the movie that can be called a continuation of the famous Disney animated cartoon could have had some sharper humour in my opinion. For me personally – this film is to be watched only once.",The Legend of Tarzan

359,jowenbmd,Tarzan Is A Fantasy. This One Delivers.,8,4 August 2016,"The Legend Of Tarzan was a long time coming and I'd say it was well worth the wait. For the first time since the silent movies have we seen Edgar Rice Burroughs' iconic character so faithfully brought to the screen. Tarzan is a fantasy. Like any fantasy film, CGI is necessary. Using CGI, director David Yates was able to have his characters interact with the wild beasts of the jungle, rather than resorting to using stock footage of animals, as they did in the old Tarzan films, just to add screen time. The negatives for this movie, in my mind, are minor and mentioning them here would constitute spoilers. This movie boasts a solid, original story with plenty of drama and lots of action.",The Legend of Tarzan
360,brandonbckln,They tried too hard,5,26 July 2016,"They tried way too hard to make this movie worth mentioning. It was dark then comical, then dark again, then suspenseful. It's like they didn't know which way to take the story. Some of the actors did a good job with what they were given, like Margot Robbie as Jane, Alexander Skarsgard as Tarzan (although he could've been less cryptic and emotionless), and Christoph Waltz as the antagonist. But other actors like Samuel L Jackson were just out of place and unnecessary to the plot. His character was by far the worse, supposedly the comedic relief, but nothing he said or did was funny. The main plot was decent, but they had potential to take it a lot further than they did. Instead they had like 3 or 4 side plots they decided to play out as well, which left us without any depth to the characters or plot, and left me not caring for Tarzan's past or the relationship between him and Jane. Another big flaw was the CGI. It was bad. 10 years ago it would've been good, but when EVERY SINGLE SHOT of an animal is CGI, then you need to step it up. Which is another grievance I have. It's a movie about Tarzan, and the African Congo, and you can't show one real animal, or even a real jungle? Cmon. That's just lazy film making.Bottom line is they tried to hard to make it funny and dark and should've done one or the other. Another summer film made to just bring in money.",The Legend of Tarzan

Maybe the last fifteen minutes are great but it's not worth the excruciating pain of the first hour plus. This movie is just full of filler material I guess to keep the costs of the animation down. They could have had a lot of fun and a great story here, but instead they made it boring with a complete lack of action. I would recommend skipping the first hour and maybe get a pizza and then show up. To catch you up, an evil King is taking over the congo with slaves to get blood diamonds, Tarzan is brought in as a sacrifice to an native leader who is blocking the mining. Gee what happens next? Didn't care, didn't wait, all to predictable",The Legend of Tarzan
362,sellers-michael,Legend of Tarzan -- Pulp Poetry With a Beating Heart,10,29 June 2016,"There's a moment in David Yates' excellent and emotionally resonant Legend of Tarzan when George Washington Williams', played by Samuel L. Jackson, goads civilized Tarzan, played by Alexander Skarsgard, just a little too much. Alexander Skarsgard's Tarzan erupts instantly and spectacularly with a combination of physical force and gut-chilling animal sounds and pins the American to a wall, then growls out the words: ""They have my wife, and their families."" In this single small moment, Yates and Skarsgard put on display Tarzan's utter commitment to the woman he loves while at the same time same evoking the internal contradiction of a man who in adulthood could pass among society as a aristocratic Englishman, but whose feral upbringing has left him with a volatile beast within that can overwhelm the civilized trappings in an instant. Unlike the filmmakers who have come before him, Yates effectively captures this duality – and in so doing delivers a film that is fresh and appealing to modern sensibilities, yet is faithful to the character of the books in ways that Hollywood has never attempted before. The result is pure pulp poetry with a beating heart. Edgar Rice Burroughs would approve of it, and 21st century audiences will, if they can be lured into theaters to see it, be intrigued and satisfied by it.Legend of Tarzan begins eight years after Tarzan and Jane (a luminous and effective Margot Robbie) have left Africa to undertake a gentrified life in London, where Tarzan has claimed his birthright of John Clayton III, Lord Greystoke. He is drawn back to Africa at the behest of George Washington Williams (Samuel L. Jackson), a black American journalist who is based on the historical figure who led the exposure of the crimes of King Leopold II of Belgium. Williams recruits him to assist in Williams' quest to investigate the suspected crimes of King Leopold. Accompanied by Jane, the two men return to Africa where Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz) has laid a trap for Tarzan that, if successful, will result in Rom delivering Tarzan to Chief Mbonga (Djimon Hounsou), who seeks to deliver vengeance to Tarzan for killing Mbonga's son many years earlier. Mayhem and adventure ensues.When Edgar Rice Burroughs was firing on all cylinders, his pulpy, emotionally infused adventure novels were able to strike a mythic vein that caused him to become the J.K. Rowlings of his day – the first global superstar pop culture author, translated into 57 languages, his books and characters embedded in cultures from Russia to Turkey and Japan. At the time of his death in 1950 he was the best known author on the planet with his works selling more than the combined sales of his contemporaries Hemingway, Faulkner, and Joyce. Hollywood tried more than fifty times and although the movies obviously met with success — not one of them ever captured what the grand old pulp master had created on the page. Yates is the first to do it; his Legend of Tarzan stands head and shoulders above the Tarzan movies that came before it–and regardless of how it fares in the crowded summer theatrical marketplace, it is assured of a place in cinema history as the Tarzan movie that captured the heart and spirit of Burroughs' creation.It remains to be seen how 2016 audiences react. Has Tarzan's time on the world stage passed, or is there indeed something mythic and archetypal that can cause the character to come alive in the modern imaginations? Yates and his team have given it an extraordinary ""best shot"" and have created something of heart, beauty, and lasting value. The editing of the film by Mark Day is taut and streamlined –not a moment is wasted and the story drives forward with energy and commitment; Henry Braham's cinematography is cool and brooding in London, and lush and earthy in Africa; the production design by Stuart Craig is grand and evocative; and the music by Rupert Gregson Williams is both emotional and pulse-quickening. Special mention goes to screenwriters Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer who updated the Burroughs material, giving it unexpected historical gravitas, while excavating from the pages of the early Tarzan books the core values that made them unique. And the CGI wizardry is seamless, photo-realistic, and effective on all levels.Give Legend of Tarzan a chance to work its magic on you. I don't think you'll be disappointed.",The Legend of Tarzan
363,ladyblue0001,Amazing,10,3 July 2016,"I loved it. The story line was well done. The Chemistry between the actors was dead on. Samuel L Jackson brought his quirky quick wit to his role which as usual was awesome. Christoph Waltz doesn't matter what role he plays he is always awesome in it. Margot Robbie was not just beautiful but gave her role a real personality that the role of Jane has not had in past movies. Alexander Skarsgard, being a fan of True Blood whom I was in love with the character Eric Northman, fell in love with him even more he did a fantastic job as giving Tarzan a more real like personality.

No more ""Me Tarzan, you Jane."" No more silly Cheetah the chimp. No more weak and helpless mate. This film takes the heart and soul of the ""real"" Tarzan and brings it into the 21st century just enough to make it appealing to the modern audience. Check it out. I think you will like it.",The Legend of Tarzan
365,bethanyslater13,Awful.,1,27 October 2016,"What an absolute monstrosity of a film. I cannot describe the hideousness that is ""The Legend of Tarzan"" - Legend? Really? Hardly a legend. If I could give minus stars, I would.First of all, I must apologise for the negativity in this review, I just have a genuine hate for this tosh. The writer of the original Tarzan would be astounded by how awful this is.OK, the actors - just because you paid big money for big actors, does not make your film big at all... And has Sam Jackson ever turned down a movie?$$$ Margot Robbie is pretty but it seems that pretty is all she is, she is absolutely one of the worst actresses I have ever watched. She is just annoying, boring, bland and I could not have picked anyone worse to play Jane. I know the first ever Jane was American but Margot is not and she does not portray a good American either, Jane should always be a British character, it just suits a lot better. Why not Rachel Wiesz? She even looks like a Jane (and is British)! Margot Robbie stick to what you're good at which is getting naked.Christoph Waltz did a great job playing his usual bad guy character, I mean it can't have been hard to decide who could play this part...Samuel did his usual funny cool guy act - I usually enjoy it, not in this.Alexander Skarsgård (that blonde guy from Zoolander/weird vampire) was absolutely dreadful, if he played even a remotely decent part I would have given 2 stars, but no, just awful. So Tarzan had been ""home"" for what, a few years and in that time he is a prim and proper British man? I had trouble believing that - of course I may be incorrect on the timings, but I struggled to even watch this crap, never mind concentrate on dates.The story line - what? who? where? when? why? what?!!?! Why did Tarzan go back to Africa? Why does Jane insist on going along? For the selfish reason of turning it into a rescue mission? If Jane didn't insist on going along, then there would be absolutely no reason to have this film? It was literally created so Tarzan can save Jane? Oh, I have never seen a film like that before! What is it with Jane? Why is she so randy all of the time? With children around as well... God, I STILL cannot get over how disturbing the ""mating call"" scene was, like yeah Tarzan, you're putting yourself out, we get it, you wanna do it with Jane. Just get it over with? We don't need to see about 5 different ""mating calls"" and have Jane tell us what it is just so you can confirm you want to bang. I'm not sure if this film is supposed to be remotely realistic or not, but Tarzan calling all the animals at the end, to have them trample all over the bad guys, and surprisingly not kill any of the good guys, is just ridiculous. Jane was right in the heart of the trampling but didn't have a single scratch on her?! Even the men looking after her were killed but she was not? It just doesn't make sense and it's annoying me. Another thing that did not add up, the African tribesmen, why were they so buff? Seriously? I understand they will most likely eat nothing but fresh meat and the occasional vegetable, but this would not give you the look of a common gym goer... These guys are on an insane training program, and a crazy body builder diet. They are actual units. Just watch a documentary or even google African tribesmen, and you will see their usual physique! Their realistic appearance!I cannot believe their budget was an estimated $180,000,000, OK so why was the CGI absolutely tragic? It looked like something from a video game.To summarise, if you love all the other Tarzan films, and like me, absolutely adore the Disney version of Tarzan, and would like to see sort of a sequel to those films, do not watch this. If you are looking for something realistic and exciting, do not watch this. If you are looking to waste 110 minutes on something boring (trust me, it is boring), with absolutely no thrilling scenes at all, then watch this! Or, alternatively, you could just do something else? It's your choice?",The Legend of Tarzan
366,moirasdad,Worth every second of your time and worth every penny of your ticket.,9,24 August 2016,"While I am painfully aware that the reviews for this film were unkind at best, I want to differ with them.For the first time in my 50+ years of film going I have gotten to see a film based on Burrough's work that was actually faithful to the spirit of his stories. I grew up on these books and adored them. After years of disappointment in the theatre, with the exception of the well intended ""Greystoke: The legend of Tarzan"" (1984) finally all my time and money has paid off. This film expertly captures both the spirit and the feel of the original novels. It also stays true to the scenarios and characters I'd come to love as a child born before computers and cellphones. In an age where Hollywood spends breath-taking amounts of money on productions, sometimes money enough to feed small nations for a year, all I've gotten from them is Flash & Bang, minimal character development and movies that have relied more on editors than directors to have any sensible plot line.So if you want a film where there is fun to be had, romance that made sense, and visuals that can both endear and haunt, try this film.Definitely a film I will be watching again and again in my quiet hours.",The Legend of Tarzan

368,brittneysaid,Amazing!!!!!,9,30 September 2016,This movie drew me in from the get go. The start was confusing and didn't seem to have any relation to the Tarzan expectancy however very quickly realized what was going on and loved the way they went with it. As someone who was only young when the previous Tarzan came out i was so looking forward to this one and it met all my expectations as a Tarzan who had already left Africa and started a new life. Adding in some everyday problems also helps relate to the characters and added to the theme of the movie.Alexander Skasgard and Margot Robbie portrayal of Tarzan and Jane was amazing and you could really see the connection. The only thing that could make this movie better is a prequel to go with it. The scenes show in the movie of 'past events' keep you asking questions (not in a bad way) but makes you want to know more about what happened when they met in more detail and how they came to leave Africa.

I must say that you need to see it at least twice to understand what's happening as a lot of the story is completely visual, and not dialogue. So you need to pay close attention. I missed a lot of visual details and visual clues the first time around as there was so much. I give it high marks because telling the story of Tarzan would be a massive undertaking and it's been done before so it had a high bar to live up to. Skarsgard was great. Christoph Waltz is always fun to watch. And I must say, I'd see any movie with Samuel L. Jackson in it. It's a good feel good story. Some people review it like it was a documentary.

The richness of the storytelling was not sacrificed for just adventure nor the mere thrill of gravity-defiance. Here is the love of one's personal history, fellow man, and life-partner, gathered within a heady mix of historically inspired plot...what more could one ask for? Oh yes, to be exquisitely faithful to the originator of the iconic literary Tarzan: Edgar Rice Burroughs. His was a Tarzan of substance, complexity, and depth that had been essentially ignored through 98 years of celluloid. No wonder audiences have managed to confound critics' prognostications and propel this movie for ten days so far (and perhaps many more) beyond industry expectations. It gives a person such as myself some hope, some reassurance, and some faith in both regular people (who will pay good money for worthwhile entertainment) as well as the elite few who are monetarily enabled to produce such a product.

372,post-2820,Not a review.,5,10 July 2016,"This is not a review. Or at least this portion isn't anyway. This is simply something I noticed while watching the film. What would you say Tarzan is most identified with? I would bet that your answer is most likely going to be his famous yell. Since the early years of cinema, we've been making Tarzan films. This is not a complaint. One of the first incredibly recognizable sound bites from that era goes to Tarzan's yell. I've seen it used a lot in modern day films, paying homage. Now what if I told you that the Tarzan yell in this movie is featured only off screen? Twice. He's never on screen while doing it. We only get reaction shots of the bad guys saying: ""He's close"", or something along those lines. Because you see, there's literally a legend of Tarzan in this movie. He is the legend. The story with Tarzan & Jane is well known. This is established. But not having Tarzan visible while he does his famous yell, is similar (to me) to constantly cutting away from the T-Rex in Jurassic Park whenever it roars. It's something that is so rooted to the character, that it's crazy to me that it would be thrown to the side. There could've been a scene where he finally does the yell on camera while taking out one of the higher ranking bad guys. A moment where everyone in the audience could think: ""RIGHT. HE DOES THAT."" But, in the end, this is just a rant about how nearly absent one of the most iconic yells in all of cinema is in The Legend Of Tarzan.",The Legend of Tarzan

This is a movie that you can watch with the whole family. Any kid or kid at heart will love it. No spoilers here. It would spoil the movie.

This had a very strong back story of the slave trade in the late 1800's. Not being a fan of Samuel Jackson I was surprised I actually liked him in this movie. I tried hard not to like him, since I really don't, but he played a very strong role here. Added some comic relief that was needed. Margot Robby also played a very strong role, not just Jane the pretty girl. She held her own in dialog as well as character. Last but not least Alex Skarsgaard, wow. Kinda yummy.

I was expecting more of a focus on the atmosphere, less weight on story, meaning beautiful cinematography to really show the elegance of nature, and a powerful soundtrack to show its strength.That's exactly what it was.Alexander Skarsgard nailed his role as Tarzan, Christoph Waltz was a decent enough villain, but in this film the only person whose acting was required to be on par was Alex, because the film is, as the title suggests, focused solely on Tarzan.There's elements of a romance between Tarzan and Jane but it's brief and not too focused upon, because once again, it's about Tarzan, being this mythical and legendary figure, the cinematography and soundtrack really conveys that, and Alexander really managed to strike a perfect balance between Tarzan's civilised and savage natures. Almost all of Tarzan's scenes, in fact almost every shot in which he is shown, makes you look upon him in amazement, not just because of how gigantic Alexander Skarsgard was required to become for this role, but also because of the camera angles, the lighting, just everything really makes Tarzan look like the biggest, most dominant, main object every time he's shown. Once again, Skarsgard managed to strike an absolutely perfect balance between the civilised and wild sides of Tarzan, and to be honest, it isn't a balance, it's heavily biased towards the wild side, the civilised side of him is subtle and whilst always present, it's overwhelmed by his natural side. The only scene in which the civilised side was in control was near the start of the film where Tarzan is seen sipping tea and wearing a suit, but even then you can see the animal side just below the surface, and you can almost feel it. The presence and power of that side of him is immense. Overall, this was a beautiful looking and sounding film, Tarzan was portrayed perfectly, and the atmosphere was spot-on, the only criticism I would have is Samuel L Jackson's unnecessary comic relief which became annoying at times, but aside from that, I enjoyed it. 7/10",The Legend of Tarzan

It's Tarzan king of the jungle . . . the thing that as little boy I was dreaming about . . . what power what agility what a superhuman . . .

She can run away but she wants to spare the Gorillas that were just about to bash her and she comes back. Gorillas don't care about the other guy (he is the bad man and he has to die at the end.

They are good but they have some lines that sometime I was wandering if they changed the tapes when I was yawning.Hopefully after all family members write the reviews some ordinary people like me can say a word. DON""T bother... From beginning to end I was asking myself one single question.... is it really possible to make a movie that bad? I give it a 3 for the actors... not for the acting because no matter how great an actor is he can not act with such lines. Samuel is like a fish on a freeway. Tarzan is a struggle between a Count and thief, being actually none. Margot is just pretty but that didn't help either . . . . What a bad bad bad movie?

Not Tarzan because I am sure I didn't sleep it trough as I was curios how bad this movie could be... I couldn't even fall asleep.",The Legend of Tarzan
380,mrgaurav-35464,Don't Miss This Symphony Of Destruction,9,13 July 2016,"The Legend of Tarzan Review - By Gaurav DaptardarHere comes yet another chapter in the universe of Warner Bros. envisioning a new era of dark and gritty superheroes which started by the tremendous success of Nolan's Batman series .Harry potter fame David Yates keeps the flambeau burning with his first faithful adaptation of Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan.The Legend of Tarzan begins with our brooding protagonist now a certain Lord Greystoke trapped in the civilized world with his feral upbringing surfacing at tender moments. A poignant scene of Jane (Margot Robbie, Beautiful yet spunky) miffed with Tarzan is found sitting on a big tree which Tarzan, now an aristocratic Englishman climbs with one graceful motion .The vicious beast within surfaces and Alexander Skarsgard's Tarzan explodes spectacularly when Jane is kidnapped by Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz, Flawless) in leau of diamonds promised for delivering Tarzan to chief Mbonga (DjimonHounsou, Powerful) who has his own nefarious plans. Skarsgard is fantastic and manages add the gravitas to the dual personality, a suave lord and King of the jungle. In a spectacular scene worthy of an Imax viewing Tarzan chases and swings on top of a moving train, takes on a bogey full of soldiers indulged in slave trafficking showing his utter commitment to the woman and the tribal families he loves. Thrilling adventure ensues .He is able supported by George Washington (Samuel Jackson, Brilliant).Edgar Rice Burroughs was arguably the first superstar author of adventure novels matched only by popularity of Arthur Conan Doyle. With books translated in more than 50 languages Burroughs legacy has left Hollywood making adaptations of Tarzan and his adventures almost 50 times finding some success. Yates version comes close to recreating what this old master envisioned. The Legend of Tarzan manages to wipe out all previous memories of Tarzan's (somewhat forgetful) big screen adaptations. Herein lies its success. The Legend of Tarzan manages to get its essence correct.The first half suffers from a slight lack of pace and is not as taut and efficient as the latter. Editor Mark Day manages to streamline Tarzan's origin and current story lines to merge smoothly. In the second half, the adventure drives forward with relentless pace with viewer almost on constant edge of the seat.The production values scream $180 millions. Special mention for cinematographer Henry Braham! His cinematography is dark edgy and foreboding in London with foreshadows of impending doom. Africa is shown in all its grandeur and glory with wide and sweeping panoramic shots. It's a visual treat. CGI is realistic and not over the top like some recent tent poles (ID Resurgence?). Music by Rupert Gregson Williams is apt and not too loud. Background score remains Warner Bro.'s trump card with another notable score. Action is well paced and sporadic. This is no captain America. Tarzan is not superhuman and gets hurt, increasing the stakes and audience's involvement.Writing is crisp and writers had the unenviable job of making this 100 years old superhero relevant in our times. They manage it successfully with a clever character played by Nick fury aka Morgan Freeman which is based on a real life character of that time. Tarzan keeps getting timely help from his native African friends dispelling any racist undertone the movie might have projected showing a white man saving Africans single-handed.It remains to be seen how the movie performs in the crowded summer blockbusters. It faces a stiff competition from a sequel awaited by a generation (Finding Dory) and another sequel which tried the same without much success (ID Resurgence). This movie is a breath of fresh air in the summer crowd. You cannot afford to miss it!",The Legend of Tarzan
381,normantray,"Excellent movie, highly recommended!",10,7 July 2016,"I followed the development of the movie for quite some time, so I expected it to be good, just not THAT good. It's a blast, from start to finish. Alexander Skarsgard is impressive in all facets of the character of Tarzan, the civilized, the wild, and he displays quite a great sense of humor and charisma. Margot Robbie is a great match to Tarzan, we buy this extraordinary couple and their romance. Samuel L. Jackson is as awesome as always in the sidekick part. Christoph Waltz is pretty much as expected, but hey, he nails villain roles like nobody! Djimon Hounsou surprised me: with just his few scenes he makes quite an impression, Mbonga is a hell of a character. Everything is great, music, cinematography. If I have complaints, it would be that fight scenes seem less impressive than they should be, and that I didn't need the overall story involving all Congo. The characters were sufficiently strong to sustain a whole movie. Hope there will be more!",The Legend of Tarzan

Thought Tarzan's jungle adventures were quite enough substance for a story. However it appeared only as a backdrop, in the form of flashbacks, for a cliché of oppressors vs slaves for diamond mines.Characters: *Tarzan was portrayed beautifully physically by Skasgard. However too much invincibility for the jungle boy for most of the scenes especially with guns. He'd rather be hurt by gorillas than by ammo, lol. *Jane was quite nice to appear as an independent lady who'd can stand for her own, Robbie was believable. *Williams'(Samuel Jackson) character quite annoying and irrelevant and can be omitted. Part was pretty only crucial to force the plot though. *Leon Rom (Christoph Waltz, one of my favorite antagonist) powerful performance despite another character inserted to force the plot. Loved the scene of Jane (Robbie) and Leon Rom (Waltz) dining, very reminiscent of Waltz's Inglorious Bastards performance. Effects: Too much CGI. But the animals scene lacked enough effect still to deliver expression or to convey more emotion. Was hoping at least to be in awe of the animals, or to trigger some pro-environmentalist feeling though.Worth watching if you want to be entertained for a bit. Prepare for some frames which appear as disconnected to the next scene to appear, at times.Still thinking, the story could have had twisted to promote nature or environment, whatsoever given Tarzan is the best material for that. Instead of a colonialism tune, where which US appears here as a savior for blacks. Ironically lol.*Old movie fanatic. New IMDb account, 1st review.

387,shion-81689,Why Tarzan is an under appreciated gem,9,31 October 2016,"Disclaimer, may contain generalized spoilers. Read at your own risk.I swear when I see the horrible reviews I just want to puke. I think to myself were they watching the same movie as me? 1.) Some people were saying why didn't they use real animals? That they'd love to see Alex act with the real deal rather than CGI. Well lets see, I would love to see some of these reviewers try to act in a room full of animals strong enough to snap you like a twig. Seriously folks, who would want to act with a real Gorilla that could rip your face off in a fit of rage or pummel you to mush. It's not a stupid idea, it's plain suicidal! Please keep it to the CGI folks; less fatalities that way. 2.) I am of the strong belief that the origin story doesn't need to shoved down my throat every time. (unlike certain movies with a bat, that feels the need to constantly show a certain set of pearls go flying in a dark alley). I love how the movie uses carefully timed flashbacks to reaffirm the old, while leaving room for something new. I loved how you could literally feel the tension as Alex tries to fit in with both humans and Apes. This movie goes as far as to show you his efforts on both fronts but inevitably he finds himself again in the jungle. There are deep obvious strong emotions you see brewing in scenes where he's alone, trying to become a man like his biological father and yet grateful to the way his ape mother raised him. At the beginning he seems to be having an identity crisis. He wants to acknowledge his human parents, but to do so he would have to resent the very jungle that took them away. But to resent the Jungle is to resent the very Ape mother that took care of him as a child. At times Tarzan just can't seem to let go of certain habits. I find the charm in this movie comes from the subtle things; the little things that end up making the whole. Alexander skarsgård did a brilliant job; his determination and dedication to the character Tarzan should not be dismiss over a nice pair of abs.There's a brain behind those shapely muscles and it shows.This movie is very deep folks, not as light as the cartoons but have no fear. There is much to laugh about. 3.)Tarzan was always white; so sorry to all socialist warriors who suddenly want to throw a fit and say its racist. Let me say as a black female African I found nothing in this movie offensive or racist (perhaps except the slavery part). There's nothing wrong with the village treating Tarzan and Jane with so much love and affection. In Africa we actually believe in the whole 'it takes a village to raise a child' thing. Jane was like a daughter to them; why wouldn't they be happy to see her after 10 years of separation. Tarzan was their hero and brother, why wouldn't they listen to him and smile with him. I swear when Socialist warriors try to force racism down my throat, I get a bit annoyed. It wasn't offensive; quite frankly I had a good laugh when they called the couple 'oyibo' (aka. word for westerners in Africa, means white). Alex was smacking anything and everyone who got in the way of saving Jane. He did not discriminate in his quest to save her folks. In a way he was actually kind of an anti-hero, Jane was his main priority; saving everyone else just kinder fit along with his plans. 4.)And as for those who say Margot Robbie got Jane wrong, go watch the cartoons again. This is exactly what Jane is like. She's educated, she's willful and she truly loves the African culture. Several times in the movie she plans and attempts to gain her own freedom by herself. It doesn't work because lets face it, we still need Tarzan to save her but can you blame the girl for trying. I was literally turn red just looking at all the other bad reviews. Half of them haven't even kept up with the original cartoon/movies/comics. They aren't fit to judge and yet they think they know. I truly believe this movie was a diamond in the rough that got buried by harsh, unfair reviews of people who couldn't be bothered to think a little deeper. Its a strong tribute to its roots, but with enough difference to bring something new to the table.If you're a true Tarzan fan I'm sure this movie must have made you feel something. So here's my review 9.5/10. There, go suck it rotten tomatoes, rolling stones, variety...who even reads these anymore.",The Legend of Tarzan
388,annalysis,Pale and tasteless in so many ways!,4,15 January 2017,"Alexander Skarsgård Is a certified hunk. Oh, yes! He could cuddle me like he cuddles that lion anytime, anywhere. And boy can he look troubled and moody, but apart from that... The plot is thin. Tarzan goes on a quest to save his wife and... Well, that's pretty much it really. And that could have been enough I guess, if there had been some fun involved. I mean, a film where a scantily clad hero swings from tree to tree yodeling loudly, there just has to be a bit of humour to carry it off. But no... The good old ""reluctant partners thrown together bickering all the time-thingy"" is to halfhearted to work here, and there isn't much else to laugh at either. (I liked the stampeding gnus though. They were hilarious.) The main problem with the film is something totally different though. It's the backdrop. A lightweight, brainless action slash adventure film set in King Leopold's Congo? ""Shocking"" is one word to describe it. An other word that springs to mind is ""tasteless"". Sure. A few Africans in chains flashes by, but that is far from enough to describe what happened in that place. The genocide, the systematic mutilations, the horror and cruelty of the exploitation... You have to fast forward to the holocaust to find something to compare it with, and if you didn't know anything about it BEFORE you saw the film, you're non the wiser afterwards. Which is extremely weak. Maybe if they had turned it into a DARK Tarzan movie. You know... Like the modern Batman series. Where the hero could have battled REAL evil, not just an unusually feeble Christoph Waltz threatening a woman. ""Oh, bad form that, old chap. Bad form."" Even the anti-imperialistic angle is so twisted it's U-shaped; a pale skinned hero saving the day and the natives gathering at the end, smiling and cheering, completely devoid of initiative. How fitting and how outdated. I'm a tad disappointed. Could you tell?",The Legend of Tarzan
389,coastrhuntr,I think this movie is very boring,1,14 December 2016,"Oh, the legend of Tarzan. One of the most hyped movies of 2016 which ended up being a completely and utterly boring waste of time. Where do I begin, how about the CGI. The CGI in this movie was not very good at all. The only CGI effect that looked pretty OK was the animals. Other than that it wasn't very good. Scenes like when they were running on the trees to catch the train weren't very good. Them swinging on to the train itself was another instance of bad CGI, and just the train itself was made out of bad CGI. Also towards the end of the movie with the stampede of I think it was water buffalo, was very badly animated, that along with the building destruction. Also the pacing in this movie was complete and utter garbage. It started out slow with the main character John (Tarzan) who is now a British politician, being invited to the Africa for some reason ( I honestly can't remember because I was that disinterested). He then started having flashbacks to his childhood and being raised by his gorilla mother. Then some stuff happens that I didn't care about and then they get to Africa. (They including Samuel L Jacksons character, and Jane). The movie starts to pick up a little bit but this is about as exciting as it gets. Even during the stampede I was still bored out of my mind. There's also a scene in the movie that used a sweeping camera angle for the shot which I thought was completely unnecessary. It was after the village had been burned down and it was the next day, while Samuel L Jacksons character and Tarzan were discussing a plan, l didn't think there was any reason for that kind of shot. The characters are also really bad. They're all flat, boring, one dimensional characters with little to no character development. The character that has the most development in the entire movie is Tarzan and that's not even much of a character development, all that happens is he goes from being a British politician to being back in touch with his roots. That's it, that's the most character development that happens in the movie. Other than that there's none, no character development after that. Also the only character that I enjoyed was Samuel L Jacksons character because he can be funny at times, and because I just like Samuel L Jackson as an actor. Finally there's the plot, if you can say there is one in this movie. What ""plot"" there is, is super predictable, and super cliché. Protagonist goes to foreign country, protagonists wife gets kidnapped by main antagonist, protagonist does anything he can to get wife back, big battle happens, protagonist and wife get back together, and everyone lives happily ever after the end. There you go I just saved you an hour and a half of your life you can now spend doing something else. Overall this movie is just bad. Like i said the pacing is slow, the CGI is bad, there's no character development, and no story/plot. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",The Legend of Tarzan
390,nebachadnezzar,Disappointing for a long time fan of the character,4,2 March 2017,"I saw another review where the author assumed that most negative reviews came from viewers who disliked Tarzan or didn't know anything about it, so I felt the need to add my two cents as a long time fan of the character.I've read the first novel and saw most movies based on it, from the very first Tarzan of the Apes from 1918 to Greystoke - The Legend of Tarzan from 1984 (which I consider to be the definitive cinema rendition of the character) and the Disney version from 1999. Needless to say I had high expectations about this one, but was at the same time afraid that they would destroy the character by trying to appeal to the mainstream.Unfortunately that is precisely what happened. Quick history lesson: Tarzan, as he is depicted in the first book, is pretty damn politically incorrect by today's standards. So, what did the filmmakers do? Simply put, they completely bastardized the character. Where the original Tarzan hanged native africans from trees, the new one befriends them, and where the former killed lions single handedly armed just with a knife and rope, the latter - you guessed it - also befriends them.And yes, I'm aware that this movie depicts a later stage in his life and, sure enough, in the latter books he actually befriended some natives and raised a lion cub, but here we never get a glimpse into this darker chapter from his early life, which would've helped immensely in giving the character some depth. Instead what we get is a perfect good guy who does no wrong, and who has an almost fantastical ability to communicate with animals and make them do his bidding.Take away any of the blood and gore that characterized the earlier books, because they need that Pg-12 rating to get the kids' money, add plenty of shiny cgi and a villain as rounded as a paper sheet (when will Christoph Waltz get the role he deserves?) and you got yourself the safest and plainest movie you could get.This film does a disservice to any long time fan of the character, and is only useful as a watered down introduction of the character to younger crowds. If you want to see a good depiction of Tarzan go watch Greystoke instead or, if that's to violent, the Disney version.",The Legend of Tarzan

394,Kitsunegari85,This is the best Tarzan movie!,10,11 July 2016,"To put it simply - the Legend of Tarzan is a magnificent movie and for me the best Tarzan movie ever! I would not trust the negative critics with this one – they were so overly harsh with this movie. The cinematography, visuals and set design are breathtaking: lush jungle canopies, amazing shades and light in the flashbacks, rivers and waterfalls, dark Congo rain forests contrasted with warm savanna colours...I can forgive one or two dodgy CGI scenes because the movie in its entirety is so overwhelming. I read that real landscape shots were made in Gabon – what an amazing scenery in this country!The score is so beautiful, dramatic (Hozier's song Better Love is great)...and that haunting tribal song in the opening scene... It was a good idea to have historical setting which includes the Belgian King Leopold's exploitation of the Congo. It brought attention to the atrocities committed against the native people in colonial Congo – the issue which in real life was raised by George W. Williams, African-American human rights activist, also one of the characters in the movie (portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson).This Tarzan is a strong, silent, brooding, conflicted type who has subdued sense of humour and Skarsgard conveys it perfectly... He possesses the necessary physique, subtlety, wildness, sensitivity and sadness ... I liked Tarzan idiosyncrasies. Not overdone to the extent which would render it ridiculous or caricature-like: ....little grunt he gives off in the carriage.....the scene with the lions he has known since they were cubs, which was beautiful and done with a measure....the scene with the children who are amazed by his hands... and humour when he teases Williams after the near b...licking scene...Tarzan in this movie is also portrayed as being somewhat rusty after spending 8 years in comfortable life of an English lord (let's just say I was occasionally not impressed by his physical prowess). His ability to communicate with the animals is one of the best parts of the movie. And that Tarzan yell is awesome!I am sure animal-lovers will love this movie (especially since no real animal was used in the movie). Tarzan's ape family (and other animals) look amazing.Although Jane and Tarzan are separated quite early in the movie, their interaction and chemistry is genuine and the actors successfully portray them as a couple who has been married for 8 years.... The love story and romance are entwined throughout the movie. I liked Robbie as a spitfire, feisty Jane. She is excellent! Good idea to have Jane growing up in Africa as well. It makes the bond she shares with Tarzan even more believable (in addition to off the charts chemistry between the characters).Djimon Hounsou (of Amistad, Blood Diamond, Guardians of the Galaxy, Constantine etc.) is simply brilliant. He has only few scenes, but he makes quite an impression as Chief Mbonga who seeks vengeance. Shame he didn't get a bigger part.I watched Weismuller's Tarzan as a child and his monosyllabic banter may have been amusing and charming, but it did no justice to the character in ERB's books. Until the Legend of Tarzan, I thought that 1984 Greystoke was the best Tarzan ever. Now, he is officially dethroned by the Legend of Tarzan. My family genuinely enjoyed this wonderful piece of old-school action/adventure/romance film-making. One of the best action films I have seen the whole year so far.

398,btarver,Hilariously Bad!,2,16 July 2016,"Visually, this film looked like it was trying to be a live action version of the Disney animated feature, down to young Tarzan's dreadlocks and Jane's yellow dress. This was easily the best thing the film had going for it.If there were live animals used in this film, I missed them, because I was so busy noticing how absolutely fake the CGI animals (and vine-swinging Tarzan) looked. Even the single blue butterfly that alighted on Jane's shoulder was obviously fake. At one point, even the green lighting reflecting off the green screen used to shoot the film is visible on Skarsgard and Samuel L Jackson.The villain, Rom, is comically bad. Showing the respect for religion that has become fashionable in Hollywood, Rom constantly carries a crucifix with him, made of spider silk and inexplicably strong. He uses this not for prayer, but to choke victims (and Tarzan) as necessary. There is of course a joke about priests and abuse, which will likely be offensive to Catholics (I am not.)The motivation of the chieftain that deals with Rom to lure Tarzan back to the jungle from London so that he can kill him is undeveloped and secretive, until the end, at which point it is resolved rather easily. You'd think that in years of knowing each other, Tarzan and the chief would've had an opportunity to discuss their grievances with one another, but apparently not.By my clock, it took an hour and 50 minutes to get to the first iconic Tarzan yell, a wimpy holler that would've been better performed by Carol Burnett. The yell is a trademark, and it was glaringly absent.Tarzan and his crew -- apes and men both -- swing through the trees in several scenes that suddenly make similar moments in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull appear more believable. These were not thrilling moments, but were comical and bad!In the movie's climactic scene, Tarzan -- who has nearly superhuman strength -- is snared by Rom with his nearly unbreakable crucifix. Unable to free himself with his hands, and somehow unable to fight off the frail and thin Rom, Tarzan nearly passes out from lack of oxygen until ... he SWALLOWS. This action, just enough extra muscle power from a weakening Tarzan, is enough to break Rom's beads, and Tarzan is suddenly free and able to fight! I laughed out loud! Tarzan, one would think, would make short work of Rom thereafter, but this is no Johnny Wisemuller Tarzan, and there are not moral lessons to be learned. Instead, Rom is left to the aggressive CGI crocodiles, who deliver the death bites.There's simply nothing redeeming about this film, and the story, special effects, plot, writing, and acting are all second rate. The title, the Legend of Tarzan is at least appropriate, because the laughs are legendary. It's unfortunate that Mystery Science Theatre 3000 is no longer in production, because this film is ripe for ribbing by that crew.",The Legend of Tarzan
399,ZenPupDog,The Legend of Tarzan (spoiler free),10,30 June 2016,"This fun ride of a film seems to encompass ""The Beasts of Tarzan"" and ""Tarzan the Terrible"" with a bit of a time shift. If you are new to Tarzan - it won't matter. We get a heroic Tarzan and Jane hellbent on helping their closest African friends, we get tremendous Mangani as graceful as colobi leaping through the upper terraces. Revenge, redemption, and retribution play out in a fast paced cinematic treat. We has a true to life evil villain doing horribly bad things, we had an equally good historic witness interact with Tarzan and Jane to stop it. Filmgoers see Tarzan and Jane as a believable couple in love with each other. Their good natured friends are equal to the tasks chosen. And even though the animals are CGI - I was happy as I could watch this adventure without worrying if animal actors were harmed in any way. I like how Tarzan communicated with ""friendly"" animals. I was happy to suspend disbelief as we saw lions and elephants visit. One has to appreciate submission posture for these gorilla like ""pan sapiens robusti"" that the Mangani must be. I was curious if these ""Apes"" were swimmers. Maybe we'll see that in the sequels. I think this film works on all levels. When the grandson of Edgar Rice Burroughs says this movie is a winner - I'm going to agree wholeheartedly. I'm going to endorse this as the Summer movie you must see at least twice.",The Legend of Tarzan
400,ocebay2,FINALLY - A Tarzan closer to way he was in the books!,8,1 July 2016,"I recently read (or re-read) about twenty of the original Tarzan books. I always wondered why we never saw a Tarzan movie that portrayed the character as he was written in the books.In the books, the adult Tarzan was very well educated and spoke several languages, but in the movies he hardly knew any English and rarely spoke in complete sentences. In The Legend of Tarzan, Alexander Skarsgård plays the character much like I imagined him when I read the books. Tarzan's command of language is competent, and his interaction with other people is never awkward or stilted as it had been in earlier movies.Some changes from the books that The Legend of Tarzan makes is the way Tarzan communicates with animals. Instead of using words (as in the books), Tarzan can read an elephant's eyes, and he calls crocodiles by mimicking a mating call. Another change is the removal of many of the more racist elements the books had in the depiction of African tribesmen, and they are not missed at all. One other element missing from the books is the science fiction or supernatural slant that several of the stories had. The Tarzan stories that had those elements were never my favorite ones anyway, so I don't mind that they are absent from this movie.One aspect of Jane's character that was often ignored in the earlier Tarzan movies, is that Jane lived in the USA before she married Tarzan. Earlier movie Janes were often given a British accent and occasionally had a pampered upbringing. It was refreshing to see Margot Robbie's take on the character. This Jane is American, and is feistier than we usually see her.Christoph Waltz and Samuel L. Jackson looked like they had a lot of fun in their roles. I enjoyed watching them, but it sort of seemed like they were there as ""stunt"" casting - nice but unnecessary. They were each good, but every time they appeared on the screen, I never really saw the characters they were playing, I saw the actors.Overall, I liked the movie. At times it was a little more ""epic"" than it needed to be, but I guess that just added to the fun. Of all the film versions of Tarzan I have seen, this one is my favorite. I think anyone who enjoyed the books would most likely agree that this is the closest to the book character of Tarzan that we have ever seen.",The Legend of Tarzan
401,djux66,"So so bad, its funny how bad it is",1,13 July 2016,"This is the worst movie I ever saw, and I've seen quite a number. I never wrote any reviews, but I think since I already wasted 2 hours of my life watching this movie, I can waste a couple more minutes and warn you guys to stay away...stay far away. So from where to begin... The story line is so boring, from the beginning to the final end. It seems disconnected and predictable, including annoying acting, boring animal scenes, hell even fighting scenes were amateur. Cheap effects doesn't bother me much as poor acting do. This is a perfect example how not to make a movie about Tarzan.And Samuel L. Jackson, what the... His character was so unnecessary. Inconvincible and unreal, trying to be funny...so sad.",The Legend of Tarzan
402,wendgord-1,great cast and cinematography only to be spoiled by an anti catholic message,1,14 July 2016,"This was to be a great cinema experience, much anticipated, as I am a life long Tarzan fan. The cast c.g.,and cinematography, and dialogue were excellent. The fact that they took such liberty with the background story of Tarzan in the flashbacks disturbed me, taking Tarzan father's hunting knife away from him was like producing a robin hood epic without a bow and arrow! but then the use of a catholic rosary used as a killing weapon by the villain was deplorable, as Catholics hold the rosary high as a religious object, then the innuendo that the villain had been given the rosary (weapon) by a priest as a child, Jane hinting that the villain had been molested by this priest was a shear attack on my faith, why? Why alienate a large part of viewing audience, and it left me leaving the theater angry.",The Legend of Tarzan
403,serrabloodmoon,"A Dynamic, Sensational, Action-Packed Crowd-Pleaser!!!!",10,1 July 2016,"Last night, my husband Martin and I boarded a bus-full of die-hard Edgar Rice Burroughs fans (ECOF 2016) to attend an advanced screening of Legend of Tarzan. These people know the Tarzan universe better than anyone on the planet, and can sometimes be the most nit- picky continuity group I've ever seen. That being said, as we exited that amazing theater, there wasn't a face in the crowd that wasn't grinning from ear to ear.John Burroughs, grandson of Edgar Rice Burroughs, reportedly had to wander the empty Warner Lot for a few minutes immediately after the movie to collect himself before gathering with the rest of us, because he was so emotionally affected by the joy of seeing his grandfather's vision finally realized.Linda Burroughs, wife of the late Danton Burroughs, chatted excitedly as we headed to the buses. She, who had attended the red carpet premiere the night before with daughters Jane and Dejah, couldn't praise the film enough.As the curtains opened David Yates delivered from second one with an atmospheric vista of the fog-enshrouded Congo, complete with a haunting tribal melody. Your hatred for Leon Rom is cemented as you see his treatment of the Congolese, and his disregard for their well-being as he and Belgium soldiers seek the diamonds of Opar through Chief Mbonga to pay his creditors for his loathsome plans. Mobonga, whose son was slain by Tarzan pre-Jane, only wants our heroes head in exchange.We see John Clayton III (Tarzan) in a meeting with parliament officials as they practically drool with the possibility of joining King Leopold's crusade through Leon Rom in the Congo. George Washington Williams, who is annoyingly cracking nuts during the meeting, sugarcoats his plan to involve Tarzan. After following him into the rain-soaked 19th century London streets, he explains why he's really there and Tarzan reluctantly agrees. As Tarzan breaks the news to Jane that he will have to return to Africa, she exuberantly begins packing as he tries to talk her out of it.The dynamic between Alexander Skarsgård and Margot Robbie is absolutely incredible. You truly believe they are Tarzan and Jane from the start, and as we take their journey along with them, you find yourself heartbroken for the child they lost, weepy as he rejoins the small pride of lions he grew up with, and the emotional greeting a herd of elephants bestow. You will cry out as you see the death-defying feats of acrobatics through the trees with grim determination and not an ounce of fear, while your respect for Jane Clayton grows minute by minute as she tries to escape the hands of Rom.But I don't want to give it all away... This is an absolutely amazing movie. Go see it as soon as possible!",The Legend of Tarzan
404,flower20851,Definitely Worth Seeing on the Big Screen,8,3 July 2016,"Definitely worth seeing on the big screen. Special effects were believable and the acting was very good. Alexander Skarsgård was a perfect choice for Tarzan! His range of being an articulate English Lord to a fighting powerhouse of fury was totally believable. Margot Robbie did well as Jane, but I think a lot of actresses could have played that part with equal skill. Christoph Waltz is so good at playing the evil villain because I think that is the only role he ever plays. And of course Samuel L. Jackson (who is always terrific) as George Washington Williams (who was a real life person true to the character in the movie). The story was different than the normal Tarzan stories so that was a plus too. I would highly recommend watching it.",The Legend of Tarzan
405,yvkgerome,"Beautiful Jane, nothing more.",3,6 July 2016,"Jane is always pretty in Tarzan movies and this one was no exception. She is beautiful, graceful and witty. Other than that the film was mediocre and the American comic relief(Samuel Jackson usually a master of rhetoric like the actual ""soon leaving"" American president ) was pitiful. I had great expectation for this remake: Tarzan riding an elephant, battling Lions, using his knife and so forth... What we saw was a King Kong/planet of the apes with a Tarzan in ""bermuda"". Waltz was a classy good villain ( his rosary pseudo presence was cheap and the supposed to be funny mention of him and his priest relationship, wasn't ""no one in the full packed IMAX movie theater laughed"") Well, the only positive thing was that my wife liked the romantic connection between Tarzan and Jane",The Legend of Tarzan

Maybe i had higher expectations from it because the trailer was so captivating and made me so eager to want see what they were bringing to the big screen.

This is so much more true to the books than we have previously seen so don't expect the ""Me Tarzan, you Jane"" garbage that has erroneously been most of the theatrical history of this larger than life character. The story is well crafted and you will enjoy the scenic views and locations. I have heard from other reviews that there is too much CGI but I do not agree with that opinion. There is not too much CGI and what is there is done very well. It is nice to have a capable villain with whom you can really loathe. Christoph Waltz does a fantastic job as the villain! This make me hopeful for a whole line of Tarzan movies being as there is so much untapped potential and material for them to easily make more. Do yourself a favor and take your family and enjoy!!",The Legend of Tarzan
410,SadieMoreno,Much better than I anticipated - A dark realization of the novels!,10,13 July 2016,"Honestly I went into the cinema for the cast, mainly Christoph Waltz and Alexander Skarsgard, but found that the whole cast had lived up to expectations I didn't know I had. Visually, regardless of peoples expectation of special effects, I found that the animals were all incredibly realistic and meshed perfectly into their surroundings. Surroundings that up until seeing the film, I had assumed were too green-tinted, it was only while watching that i realized just how well the colour scheme actually worked. I ended up leaving the cinema thinking that Alexander Skarsgard's accent was much better than I thought it would be and that Margot's wasn't at all half bad. I feel that there should be no reason to say just how good Christoph Waltz was as a psychological villain. Even Alexander Skarsgard, who would have to be my favourite actors at the moment, was out shined in certain scenes by Djimon Hounsou. That man(Djimon)is one of the most heartfelt and underrated actors I've ever seen, he can move from so many emotions so quickly and can make you feel for his characters with the smallest change. (See Blood Diamond) To conclude, it's easy to assume that by reviews from critics that this film might be a flop, but without getting your hopes up I can safely say that it has a solid story line and has no direct relation to the 1999 cartoon, but rather the Edgar Rice Burroughs novels. In the end it's up to you to go see it, but my personal opinion is that you should go into the cinema thinking it may not be the best, but definitely worth the watch, and you might be surprised by what you see, You may even laugh. Especially when Samuel L. Jackson's on the screen, need I add it. My favourite thing about it, was how they incorporated real historic people into the story line (Leon Rom and King Leopold etc.)",The Legend of Tarzan
411,nareshmodi,Lives up to the name,7,10 July 2016,"Having seen most of the Tarzan movies from the days of Johnny Weissmuller, and then more recently Jungle Book, I would have normally avoided this movie. But thanx to IMDb, who gave it a 6.9, and then some of my fellow reviewers gave it 8 and a 9, I was not disappointed at all, and gave it a 7 myself. The missing 3 points are because Jungle Book had superior spell bounding cinematography ( not that this one is too bad ) The casting is very good, except for Sam Jackson, who somehow does not fit into the role. The main characters do a good job of their roles, though Tarzan is a bit wooden faced.Jane has done very well, and the African casting is superb.

The characters are well rounded, the story has a virtue, not just a naked man in the woods. There are some fabulous sights and great settings.The movie emphasizes Tarzan's love, loyalty, courage, devotion to the people around him and his counteracts of injustice. He is strong and passionate but we can see his internal contradictions; when he lives in London as a Lord or while he fights for the lives of others with bare hands deep in the jungle. He's capable of adapting and working with nature. He is a true hero and his power comes from just being a man.",The Legend of Tarzan

Beautiful landscape, for sure, fascinating animals, breathtaking scenes of Tarzan 'flying' through the jungle, some action, a little love, a main actor embodying both the English aristocrat and the wild man who grew up with gorillas well. Maybe a little thrill from time to time and a bit fun. Well, easy to tell it was all the above. Plus great music, S.L. Jackson and C. Waltz on top. I truly enjoyed every bit of it, I liked Skarsgård, in my opinion he acted very well especially his 'animal-like' expressions were great.What I would not expect in a Tarzan movie is a complicated story line full of twists and deep conversations, completely unexpected over the top performances or anything. Obviously this is not what the movie was like. Anyways, unlike many other reviewers, I did not have the feeling of watching too much green-screen-action at all, though I am sure no expert in detecting those.One needs to keep in mind that this is an adaptation of a children's book. Still, the movie was not meant solely for children, but real fun and excitement for adults as well. I recommend watching this.

It was reverent in the right places, with probably the best live-action depiction of Tarzan, one that is closer in tone to ERB's literary work than any other iteration. You can sense the backstory in Tarzan's brooding silences, his pensive soul, his concern for Jane, and his maturing acceptance of civilization's capacity for greed and violence. The director treats us with lush African landscapes, sultry jungle ambiance, ambitious tracking shots, majestic animals and fantastic character animation - all in reverence to ER Burrough's source material. When combined with the sensitive portrayal of Tarzan by Alexander Skarsgård, this film hits a new cinematic benchmark for Tarzan. Go and enjoy the trip!",The Legend of Tarzan

A mission to save not only his wife but his home and his families (both human and mangani).A breath of fresh air to watch. Action with a purpose and well muscled eye candy swinging on a vine to boot.

Don't mean North America is the attitude of the world? All kinds of characters have attitude does the movie? I don't speak Thai mountain, just hate, since the beginning of the film is a negative character, Samuel Jackson said outside the carriage under him I would be angry, when god, crazy, character is such a change? Say good let it go, say good return home? Then there is the kiss up to the tree? Say good rhythm? Character attitude shift means to enter the second act, so that what the devil's kiss up tree? Is that a debate!!!!!! The first act is not complete in the second act, I can't imagine how to allow such writers and Hollywood director? Back again, such as needles, taishan shift and room? His character confusion in where? Structure didn't understand that in the main line is not clear, people power is almost a joke, all the action is not based on mount tai and attitude changes is the plot. External insufficient internal impetus plot drive is bound to lead to character.2, besides the characters Mount tai is a pair of sleepy right from the start, this is taboo, the character of the negative and the most terrible is good bollywood director opening for not offering a simple task in mount taishan, flow no show of life, save the cat scene is missing, mount tai is less likable. The whole scene one tends to hold onto taishan emotional protection shell, absolutely wrong. ""Little shoes"" in the hero's opening is what? Is the flow of life, it is him to feed the ostrich, the results bear children had an accident. This is called the opening story, this call character build. Then talk about the action behind the mount tai, in a word, no enthusiasm, why? Because the theme confusion leads to people running out of steam. Mount tai is why go to the jungle? Why do you want to go to Congo? Samuel convince him immediately? Why is that? Mount tai is really care about what? Writer and director really figure it out? The character of Jane is dispensable. Just setting are needed, inner attitude does not need, I even said that the enemy Just grabbed tribal friend of mount tai, mount tai will go to save lives.3, and finally talk about the topic We all want to express the theme of the clear director, but, I'm sorry, I'm absolutely not. The expression of theme was sent into ecstasy, don't give a damn what the audience watching. Theme must come from details, rather than from a great thing. ""Schindler's list"" Della's goal is to save more people, not to stop the war. People sex in the real exquisite plot magnify hundreds of times, to liberate slaves than great Della. Think about an impending theme, but have nothing. Tai shan will not shoulder the mission of emancipation, he this character set is doomed the character he is not going to be, that is the President of the United States do. Besides small theme, taishan body carries small subject too much, too much confusion, are you want to let go of the past, or going to do? Mount tai in the end what get? We say that the end of the story determines the quality of the story. At the end of a story, the story just like animation childish, I didn't see taishan any growth!

It is a beautiful movie, with incredible action and powerful scenes such as Kala's death that are very moving.Where it touches on Tarzan's origins in a series of flashbacks, it is always respectful of the origin material but tweaks the story here and there for the movie. My only complaint would be the fight scenes. As others have mentioned, the way they are filmed leaves a bit to be desired.This is the best Tarzan movie ever, and it is hard to see how anyone could do a better one.

Where to begin? . . . which is apparently the same question Roland Emmerich was asking himself before, during and after the film was over. The first hour of the film is a constant and tiring reminder that there used to be a Tarzan etc etc etc and to be fair, Tarzan was never really that interesting a story.It's difficult to say whether or not there's any spoiler alerts in this quick review because there isn't anything to spoil. In short, the one - star review is basically for the appearance of Margot Robbie's face, even if she is billed FIFTH on IMDb behind five male actors, three of whom are playing the same character.As for the film itself, Christoph Waltz is in it . . . so he's the villain then . . . Alexander Skarsgard is in it cause . . . well . . . someone needs to do be Thor & casting a Hemsworth would probably be a bit on the nose . . . Margot's in it obviously . . . cause you know, why not? . . . and Sam Jackson's in it cause it's a movie.Djimon Hounsou does an admirable job, acting as if his role isn't completely beneath him and for a film that seems to admire the environment so much, the fact that there are no real animals in it, being worn as some kind of badge of honor in the p.r drive, speaks volumes about the overall quality of the production.I could arguably give the film two stars because of Sam Jackson's presence but that's just not enough to qualify this plot less, pointless, piece of boring nonsense as anything other than a complete waste of billions of dollars and anybody's viewing time.So obviously expect the sequel sometime in the next . . . zzzz . . . zzzzzz . . . zzzzzz.",The Legend of Tarzan

I went to this movie with high expectations like full of action scenes with animals and friendship with them but it fails in all elements . The whole movie is a one line story (Tarzan kills the tribe head brother so the tribe head wants Tarzan to be killed but he fails) . A Silly one line story.But comedy works well with the Samuel. The one best scene in this movie is the climax scene where all animals will attack the fireman it is the one of the best one and the other scene I liked is talking to lion with sighs is very funny . The movie is very slow and boring . Finally who loves Tarzan can watch this movie without any expectations.My Rating is 2 out of 5 :(,The Legend of Tarzan

It is a boring film filled with way too many flashbacks and some dialog that just makes no sense. My major complaint coming out of this movie was it tries to be a new version of Tarzan but tries to input the origin of Tarzan into the film. Another major complaint is that the CGI completely sucks. The gorillas don't look real they look as if they're straight out of a ps4 video game. There are two good things and that is Margot Robbe as Jane, now of course she is a damsel in distress but out of all the characters in the film she had the most well written dialog and another good thing is the Sam L.Jackson character. They are the two positive things about this film. All and All this movie is stupid and not interesting by the end of the year this will be in my top 5 worst of the year.

430,mlbean7,The most enjoyable version of Tarzan I've ever seen,9,4 December 2016,"I've been watching Tarzan movies since I was a child. In the last twenty years there have been multiple big screen versions made and in my opinion each was worse than the the one before...until now. As Tarzan movies go, this one is really good.The imagery was stunning. I didn't expect this level of realism in regards to the scenes where the actors would be interacting with what would have to appear to be a large group of wild animals. Alexander Skarsgard makes Tarzan interesting and Margot Robbie adds just enough of spunk to Jane to keep her from being being the stereotypical damsel in distress this character is typically portrayed as.David Yates did a good job with the story. It's Tarzan so I didn't expect the plot to be anything more than I knew it would be, Tarzan saving Africa from the bad guys in some shape or form. That is what Tarzan does. I particularly enjoyed the way the main characters' back stories were integrated into the scenes without them causing the film to drag or become boring. If you're looking for a deeper more meaningful plot then you need to find another kind of movie. This is a TARZAN movie and in my opinion, it's a really good version.",The Legend of Tarzan
431,yorkiemays,A good action movie at last !,10,16 July 2016,Great film with plenty of action and great special effects. Best thing I have watched in this genre since King Kong 2005 and Planet of the Apes 2014. Not sure how Sam L looked so young - I want some of those pills. Great acting and story line even if it does not follow the book.Skarsgaard was good as Tarzan and Margo added a bit of beauty alongside the beast.Having been brought up with Tarzan movies I may be a bit biased and it will be interesting to see how a modern audience likes it.Well worth the trip to the cinema and will be watching it again on DVD.,The Legend of Tarzan

I don't know about you, but when the villains are portrayed as sadistic psychopaths with no real motive or character, I lose interest in the story.tl;dr lots of CG, completely two-dimensional characters and a plot that could've been auto-generated with a smartphone app.",The Legend of Tarzan
433,tony_caleb,Tarzan in long pants?? Boo!,1,2 July 2016,What? Are we that homophobic? Tarzan is now in long pants? That's the end of my interest regardless of whether or not the film is any good.They wouldn't feel the 'need' to do this to a female character so why do it to a classic wardrobe (or lack thereof) of a male one?? I think it's really sad and pathetic that some people are so prudish in this way. Greystoke managed a decent telling of the story with a loin cloth and nobody turned gay by watching it. I don't think Alexander would've had a problem with a loin cloth considering the nudity he did on True Blood. Greed and profits are destroying the industry.,The Legend of Tarzan
434,sandeepbumblebee,Beautifully shot,9,13 July 2016,"Although the plot was a relatively simple one, it was well executed, with a few unexpected twists and turns here and there. I believe both long time fans and newbies will love this movie. Critics have come out against the movie for the way it dealt with racial issues by saying things that were diametrically contradictory. While some of them allege that the story is outdated and not relevant for this time and age, others purport that the story is anachronistic because the writers tried to make the protagonist a savior of the native Africans(Which was not the case with most white people at that time). Well, guess what, Tarzan is not your typical white guy. Although he may be pale skinned(Which his creator Edgar says his name literally means in 'gorilla' language!) his heart belongs to his home: Africa.The world was quite different back then, and it is refreshing to see things in a different light once in a while. Jane is a strong character with many endearing qualities. Not only is she brave, independent, and witty, but also beautiful and romantic. She adds depth and grace to the movie. I do not understand why the ratings are so low for this movie. The movie was beautifully shot. The visuals look spectacular. Both the CGI and the natural world in the film were breathtaking.Whatever the reasons for the negative critic reviews and low ratings may be, I found the movie to be entertaining, beautiful, and overall, a good experience. Looking forward to watching it again!",The Legend of Tarzan
435,dixonmovies-55596,The Legend of Tarzan' is a talky and under-adrenalized reboot.,4,2 July 2016,"Author Edgar Rice Burroughs' most famous character, Tarzan of the Apes, has re-emerged on movie screens, this time at the hands of ""Harry Potter"" helmer David Yates. As promising as that might sound, hold the applause. ""The Legend of Tarzan"" is a disappointing and under-adrenalized excuse for an action/adventure movie.Tarzan has been living the life of an English lord at his ancestral home with Jane for a decade when the movie opens, turning down an entreaty from government bigwigs to return to Africa to accept an invitation from King Leopold of Belgium to see how well his colony in the Congo is going. Samuel L. Jackson, as Dr. George Washington Williams, is on hand representing the United States government, and has his own reasons for wanting Tarzan to accept the invitation. We know he's going to say yes. A Tarzan movie set entirely in London wouldn't be much of a Tarzan movie, after all. There's skullduggery afoot though, and no sooner have the current Lord and Lady Greystoke set foot on African soil again, Jane is kidnapped, and Tarzan has to swing through the dense jungles to find her, all the while being led into a trap.Africa has been a staple of Hollywood movies since ""Trader Horn,"" and author Edgar Rice Burroughs' enduring pulp hero Tarzan has been a perennial movie hero since before movies could talk. ""The Legend of Tarzan,"" frequently seems to do nothing but talk, and that's not necessarily a good thing with a Tarzan movie. It's not that anyone is asking for a return to the days of Johnny Weismuller and ""Me Tarzan, you Jane"" (and yes, that's a real line, not one of those ""did he really say that"" lines). In Burroughs' novels, Tarzan is multilingual and articulate. That's not the same thing as needless speechifying.To be fair, Tarzan doesn't get the longest speeches in ""The Legend of Tarzan,"" but the fact remains that this is an oddly talky and slow-paced affair for a Tarzan movie. Blame the screenplay by Adam Cozad and Craig Brewer, which though ""based"" (to use the word loosely) on the stories of Edgar Rice Burroughs is largely an original script with some Burroughs origin story awkwardly inserted as flashbacks. It bears noting that Burroughs' original 1912 novel has never been adapted faithfully, although it's virtually never been out of print. Not only is the script too talky, but much of the talk is clunky and anachronistic. Although the story takes place in the 1880's, you'd never know it from the all-too contemporary- sounding dialogue.The worst offender is the character of Jane, played by an engaging Margot Robbie, who, as in the novels, is portrayed as American, but hardly an American woman of the Victorian age. This Jane is thoroughly modern, but that's neither convincing nor terribly entertaining. It might also be noted that her backstory has been heavily overhauled by Cozad and Brewer, and not for the better. (Jane in the novels did not grow up in Africa, for one thing.)Alexander Skarsgård plays a kinder, gentler Tarzan, but it's an open question as to whether that approach is actually a good idea.Skarsgård looks the part well enough, though he isn't quite the godlike creature of the books. Yates takes a nearly homoerotic delight in displaying Skarsgård's well-sculpted physique, which looks more like the result of hundreds of sado-masochistic hours in the gym than being raised in the jungle by apes, but this is a sensitive Tarzan, moved to near tears by looking into the eyes of a CGI elephant. It's not quite possible to reconcile this Tarzan with the boy who was beaten nearly to death by a great ape - a flashback lifted, if sanitized, from Burroughs' original novel. And although Skarsgård clearly gets that Tarzan is a man with a foot in two worlds, but not quite belonging in either, he fails to find the exuberance in Burroughs' story, and the result is a little too depressing to be fun.Yates fails to infuse the movie with any real sense of adventure, and there's shockingly little momentum. And from a ""Harry Potter"" director, it's also shocking to see the mediocre quality of technical craftsmanship exhibited here. The photography is bland and unimaginative; the special effects are sub-par. One CGI critter after another parades by, each less convincing than the last. The fleet of ships that provide a major element in the movie's third act are singularly fake-looking, and it might be noted that the season finale of ""Game of Thrones"" pulled off a similar effect better with less money.The supporting cast includes such stalwarts as Christoph Waltz, Jackson, Djimon Hounsou, James Broadbent and Simon Russell Beale (Showtime's ""Penny Dreadful""). Waltz is particularly disappointing, turning in yet another stock B movie villain performance, completely devoid of menace, charm, or interest. Waltz has won two well- deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscars for Quentin Tarantino movies, but no one else seems to be able to get anything even remotely interesting out of him. As for Jackson, he's playing a Tarantino type here, although it's very difficult to reconcile the character with the Victorian age or anything going on in the story. At least he's fun to watch. Hounsou plays a menacing tribal chieftain with sincerity, but really doesn't have much to do. Beale, a dangerous scene-stealer, utterly upends Waltz in their few scenes together, and leaves the audience wishing he'd had more to do. To be fair, the 3D post-conversion is high quality, and does add some impact to both the action scenes and the vistas, both real and digital. The music score, by Rupert Gregson-Williams (""Hotel Rwanda,"" ""Over the Hedge,"" ""Grown Ups,"" ""Here Comes the Boom"") is a pale imitation of ""The Lion King,"" which says a lot about the level of original thinking, or lack of it, permeating the entire movie.",The Legend of Tarzan
436,laurapnk,Exceeds expectations- a must see,10,9 July 2016,"Today I went to see this movie thinking that it was not going to be that good, and that Alexander Skarsgard was going to be a rubbish Tarzan. How wrong was I! This movie doesn't follow the typical Tarzan story we see in its Disney movie predecessor, instead it takes place several years after Tarzan (John Clayton- interesting surname yes?) leaves the jungle for a posh little life in England and is forced to return to his roots. What follows is a wonderful spectacle, I mean the effects in this movie are out of this world and I take my hat off to all that worked on it! I'm pretty much new to IMDb ratings and this is the first movie I have felt the need to write a review of! Its pretty long but bottom line is that I loved it (wanted to capitalize every letter but apparently I'm not aloud to shout)",The Legend of Tarzan
437,cmbowles,A bland effort,5,2 September 2016,"Bland is the only real word to describe The Legend of Tarzan. Alexander Skarsgard certainly looks the part and has some charisma as Tarzan but he is consistently undercut by a half-cooked script. The same goes for Margot Robbie as Jane who's only purpose in this film is being the damsel in distress. Samuel L. Jackson and Christoph Waltz are also hung out to dry with their one dimensional characterizations as the comic relief/sidekick and mustache twirling villain, respectively. The film is also very unfocused as it constantly shifts to flashbacks and present day. This can be an effective technique however in this film the flashbacks bring any momentum the film manages to get to a screeching halt. The pacing of this film is the biggest issue that this film has. I was a huge fan of director David Yates' Harry Potter films, but with this movie he seems unsure with the kind of movie that he wanted to make. To move on to a more positive note, the cinematography is simply gorgeous. The lush landscape of the jungle makes for some great visual moments. However at the end of the day besides the cinematography and Skarsgard's performance, there is not much to recommend in this one.",The Legend of Tarzan
438,dazzy-02872,leave well alone,4,22 July 2016,"I must say that this movie was awful in every regard. story line was confused and muddled which led to the whole movie going experience in tatters. fail. I went with a friend as a last minute whim and boy did we regret it, she was constantly in and out of consciousness and I found myself patting myself down looking for match sticks to prop open my eyes. seriously bad. The movie opens with Tarzan being in London wearing a suit. need I say more! I have never been one to walk out of a movie but dang it did this push me close to the edge and knowing the running time also didn't help because I was looking at my watch for what seems an eternity for this miserable flop to end.",The Legend of Tarzan
439,TheProdigalKnight,"Not bad, but forgettable",5,1 July 2016,"There is fun to be had in The Legend of Tarzan. The locations are visually appealing, the set design and costumes look good, and the acting, for the most part, is quite good. However, this film suffers from an underwhelming story combined with truly terrible cinematography and even worse editing making this film quite forgettable.The film takes the story of Tarzan in an interesting new direction with the film taking place 10 years after the events of Tarzan that people are more familiar with. We see Tarzan living in London with his wife Jane where he now goes by John Clayton III instead of Tarzan. He tries to deny his past and refuses to go back to the Congo. However, devious events orchestrated by Christoph Waltz's character, Leon Rom, force him to return to his old home along with George Washington Williams, played by Samuel L. Jackson, to stop Rom and save Jane. It's an interesting story laced with flash backs to Tarzan's origins. To summarize my critiques of the story, the film simply has too much going on. There are many character arcs and conflicts the film wants to address, but doesn't have enough time to fulfill any of them.What kills the overall experience is the cinematography and editing. This problem is primarily during all the action sequences. The action is so poorly cut together that you can't really tell what's going on. You have no sense of where characters are in relation to each other as the action is happening. It's jarring and confusing and makes it difficult to become invested in the action. What should have been intense action scenes become very underwhelming. The poor cinematography doesn't help either. The camera work simply doesn't look appealing at all. While large far away shots of the landscape look great, the more personal close-ups and action look very dull. None of these things make the film bad, in any sense of the word. But the lesser quality of all these elements take what could have been a fun adventure movie and make it a forgettable experience. You'll be entertained enough, but you will forget about it in a day or two.",The Legend of Tarzan
440,skyman-50725,FINALLY!!! The Tarzan film fans have been waiting for!,10,30 June 2016,"FLASHBACK: 1998 Having tracked the project from pre-production to final release, and with all the excitement and anticipation I'd built up for the film, I entered a dark theater in Little Rock, AR completely jacked UP to see ""Tarzan And The Lost City"". It was the Saturday noon matinée, first weekend of the release. Having read the original novels as a youth, I was looking so forward to the movie that would do justice for a modern audience regarding the character I grew up loving, dispelling all the silly pop-cultural stereotypes and giving him a proper and fitting introduction. I got the best seat in the house that day, but for the wrong reason as I looked around and realized I was the only one in the room. Optimistically, I later joked with friends that I'd gotten a ""private screening"" of the film. A few years later, I ended up launching my Tarzan fansite, TARZAN.CC, utilizing many graphics pilfered from the ""Tarzan and the Lost City"" website to emulate the look. It was my tribute to the film. And I soon began that journey of excitement and anticipation yet again for the new rumored Warner Bros. Tarzan project. I'd love to chronicle that adventure here, but it would distract from this review so I'll sum it up by recognizing the names of the fallen on that journey: Director John August, Director Guillermo del Toro and Screenwriter John Collee, Director Stephen Sommers I finally lost hope that the film would ever come to fruition.And then, a few years beyond a decade later, Warner Bros. were basically told to get their act together or lose their option on the project. And they stepped up to the challenge in spades with ""THE LEGEND OF TARZAN"".Just last Tuesday, I was privileged to attend a private early screening with the film's producers, members of the Edgar Rice Burroughs family, several very esteemed persons tightly connected to the Tarzan universe in film, print, art, and fandom, plus a few friends I brought along to see how they received it.On all fronts, ""The Legend of Tarzan"" was a KNOCK OUT OF THE PARK!!! A state of the art theater on the studio's own lot packed to the brim with eager fans; once again, the BEST seat in the house (depending on your tolerance). I was 2nd row center, with a HUGE screen in front of me and the killer audio rattling me to the bones.The reaction to the film was UNANIMOUS as we applauded straight through the final credits. Finally, a studio who put the money necessary into producing the RIGHT film. Finally, a screenwriter and director who cared enough about the source material to fight hard for their vision of the film, and get the right actors for the job. And FINALLY a film worthy of the original character of Tarzan from Edgar Rice Burroughs' original novels, with all his power, fearlessness, and without hesitation toward action against insurmountable challenges.See this film expecting to see a fitting representation of real heroism driven by love, dedication, and absolute resolve. This generation has been sorely deprived of these types of positive, character-inspiring role models as marketing peeps have instead perfected the profitable art of catering to and nurturing our more dangerous, self-destructive instincts and childlike demands for instant gratification and our society has unarguably become weaker for it. It's time for a whole new generation to rediscover their primal drive to love and protect their own, fight for their place in this world, and establish their individuality as leaders instead of followers. This is the film we've been WAITING for, and I'm encouraging people to drop their concepts and preconceptions, see the film, and learn from it. This is an ERB novel realized on screen, a true pulp adventure beautifully brought to life with dramatic excellence, and for new folks it might require the ability to step outside their familiar world for a moment to appreciate. If it doesn't quite grab you the first time through, a second viewing is highly recommended.AAA+++ 10/10",The Legend of Tarzan
441,HippiWitch,The Legend of Tarzan is Magnifique!,10,30 June 2016,"I just experienced The Legend of Tarzan, and in the immortal words of the Countess Olga de Coude ""Magnifique!"" is the only thing that I can think. Sadly, I arrived at the theater for the early release of TLOT to an empty theater. I sat alone in the center of the empty theater reading my copy of The Return of Tarzan quietly in wait for the movie to begin. Slowly a few other viewers trickled in but sadly, the theater might as well have been completely empty. The previews for other movies came and went as previews do and then the opening of this long awaited Tarzan began.I sat in rapture as Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan came to life in front of my eyes. Yes, It IS ERB's Tarzan. There are liberties that Mr. Yates took with the characters and locations, but all in all, THIS IS TARZAN as he was meant to be. Quiet, Strong, Passionate, steely eyed... ""Magnifique!"" The Mangani are Mangani. They are not chimps nor gorillas. They are huge, magnificent beasts. Were Mr. Burroughs alive today, I wholeheartedly believe that he would jump up and down like a young child shouting ""YES! YES! That's them!""Kala is every child's mother, protective and loving. The relationship between Tarzan and her is perfectly portrayed. The love Tarzan feels for his ape mother is passed on to the movie viewer to be felt, not just seen.The panoramic views of the jungle are even as ERB described them to be. Dark, foreboding, beautiful and deadly. It is the jungle of Tarzan.This is not an action movie in the vein of Captain America or any of the modern action movies. It is a story. A very well told story of adventure driven by the love of a man for his mate. Is there action? Of course there is action. It wouldn't be Tarzan without action. But first and foremost, it is a very well written and delivered story. It is a story that Edgar Rice Burroughs himself would have told. He would be proud and finally relieved that his creation had finally come to life in a manner that does justice to his creative genius.I sat through the movie mesmerized. Spellbound. It ended just like it should, you won't be disappointed. As the credits began to roll, I quietly stood up, still in a mostly empty theater, and walked out to my awaiting truck to drive home and write this review.If people listen to the critics who did not like this movie, they will be missing out.For those of us who love the works of Edgar Rice Burroughs, GO SEE THIS MOVIE!I wish I could say more, there is so much to say. I'll end this with this. I'll go see it again, and again and when it comes out on DVD, I'll own it and watch it till I have seen it as many times as I have read the books, which is really saying something.",The Legend of Tarzan
442,ww_nights,LEGEND OF TARZAN--A Common Sense Review,10,1 July 2016,"It's simple. If what you want is a live-action version of the Disney cartoon, or a remake of those old ""Me Tarzan, you Jane"" camp fests, this isn't the film for you. If you don't like the character to begin with, this isn't the film for you. The vast majority of critics who thus far have given the movie unfavorable reviews fall into one or both of these two categories. It's disheartening, and it's so obvious they don't really know anything about the character and don't care enough to learn.If, however, you have yearned for the day in cinema when Edgar Rice Burroughs' epic hero is treated with the gravitas and respect he deserves, and if you enjoy epic jungle adventure with a heart, by all means GO SEE THIS MOVIE! It is phenomenally good! Think of it like you would a dish of food. Let's say spiced curry. If you don't like spiced curry, you won't like it no matter how well it is prepared. This movie is for those who enjoy spiced curry. For those who love it, this is the most delicious dish you're ever likely to taste.",The Legend of Tarzan
443,worndoff,"A terrific film, faithful to the spirit of Burroughs' Tarzan",10,1 July 2016,"I've been a Burroughs / Tarzan fan for over 50 years, and have seen all the existing authorized Tarzan films. I've enjoyed them to varying degrees, but few have been truly faithful to Burroughs' character of Tarzan. Until now. This film does by far the best job of capturing the spirit of Burroughs' Tarzan of any film to date, particularly the idea of nature (English nobleman) vs. nurture (his jungle upbringing). More importantly, The Legend of Tarzan is a terrific, engaging story, with great characters and pacing and plenty of action, but not so much that it seems like overkill. The story's focus and presentation has been updated from Burroughs' first 104-year-old story, as has been stated in write-ups and interviews. But note that the issue that draws Tarzan back to the jungle in this film is essentially the same one that originally brought his parents there, as described in the first two pages of that first novel. Yates and company have done a superb job of crafting a good old-fashioned adventure, retaining the look and feel of the Africa of a century ago, and combining it with a plot and theme that is relevant today, aided greatly by the addition of real life character George Washington Williams. The scenery and special effects are first rate. As noted above, the spirit of Burroughs' Tarzan is beautifully captured. The few detail changes from Tarzan's backstory are minor and serve to support the story. For example, Jane is more feisty than we are used to in previous films and in the earlier books, but in my opinion that merely improves the story. A must see!",The Legend of Tarzan
444,jr-26897,Best adaption to date!,9,1 July 2016,"I saw this movie last night by myself, and will be going again tonight. Tonight, I am taking family members with me, so they can get a tiny glimpse into why Dad is the 51 year old kid he is today, and why he has never stopped geeking out, collecting and reading all things related to Edgar Rice Burroughs long into middle age, with no intention of stopping. This movie did it, it put on screen the Tarzan (and Jane) that I envision, based on the books and in a way never done before. I hope they all understand at least a little, even if they don't get Dads obsession, its a hell of a movie that I am certain they will enjoy! The movie was not packed, about a 1/3 full, probably expected for an early screening, mostly older people, but some teenagers and some smaller children as well.The movie, all though not perfect was about as close as I could have hoped for in portraying this character, and instilling the sense of wonder and excitement on the big screen, that we all sensed growing up reading the novels and the comics.Yeah, some liberties were taken, some settings and time frames are not exactly as Burroughs wrote them, but that is expected somewhat in a movie that needs to appeal to a broader audience. The main thing, the most important thing, is it was obvious the Director, Producers writers and actors all were familiar with the ERB works enough to want to get this right, in respect to ERB, and all the fans who yearn for a really good Tarzan movie! The movie does not start out quickly as far as action, and that is OK, because we are learning about the relationship between Tarzan and Jane, and why they are living in London, and not their birthplace Africa. We learn a lot about the depth of love these 2 share, and their commitment to each other, which sets the stage for what is to come. This is, a love story at heart ,and that is one of the reasons it works. Burroughs understood the need for romance to play a large part in his novels, and that is an aspect of this film that will be appreciated, and hopefully draw in a larger audience.One of the most touching, and tender moments, is Lord Greystoke and Jane, in their quite moment in a tree on their London estate, just prior to returning to Africa.Tarzan, is played almost perfectly by Skarsgard, quiet, reserved, intelligent, fierce, majestic, yet slightly vulnerable in his affection and devotion to his mate. Robbie, as Jane was amazing in this role, and a force to be reckoned with in dealing with enemies! Of course, Samuel Jackson is always excellent, and here his character serves as the perfect impetus for 2016 audiences, to draw Tarzan back to his homeland. The scene in the coach, just after John is swayed by Williams to return, where John ""chuffs"" in anger upon hearing what is happening in his beloved Africa, was subtle, but moving.Christopher Waltz, as Rom played the perfect bad guy (as usual) his relatively small physical presence belied a well honed dangerous ability with his small makeshift lasso, which he used to good effect.We see in this film a gradual return to the greatness, the strength and prowess that we expect from Tarzan. He does not return to Africa 100% Tarzan, in strength and ability, but mid way through, and certainly towards the end, he becomes the nearly superhuman Tarzan that we all expected! I do wonder, how Tarzan will be depicted, moving forward in future films(fingers crossed) as I'm sensing we wont see Tarzan Killing Beasts to the extent he did in the novels by way of his fathers Knife. I'm not certain audiences these days want, or will accept a Tarzan that so easily and readily kills as he did in the books to protect others.Most people these days I'm thinking would not connect with someone killing such majestic creatures as Lions, Tigers, Gorillas etc.That blade, that ""Long tooth"" was what gave Tarzan the edge, against far stronger creatures. Tarzan battling his brother upon his return to Africa, it was very evident, that even with all of Tarzans great strength, and intellect, physically he was no match, he needed that knife.I'm really interested in hearing others thoughts on this point in particular.Finally, huge Kudos to Skarsgard, in playing this role. He completely made me believe in the character, amazing performance!!! I give this movie, a 9 out 10",The Legend of Tarzan
445,martinpowellb,A Brief Spoiler-Free Review,10,2 July 2016,"I don't remember ever being introduced to Tarzan of the Apes. Seems that I've known him all my life, probably from watching the old movies on TV and looking at my older brothers' comics long before I could read. Tarzan has always been there. When I discovered the novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs at age 13, I encountered a more complex, far more fascinating hero than was ever shown in the comic pages or on the screen.Until now.Warner's THE LEGEND OF TARZAN presents the truest portrayal of Tarzan ever depicted by Hollywood. He's intelligent, charismatic, and savage. Burroughs would be very satisfied, I think, and members of his family have told me that they are delighted with the new film. Its elegant, dangerous atmosphere and thrilling special effects are absolutely mesmerizing (the Mangani apes, especially Tarzan's foster mother Kala, are wonderfully realized and purposely described as *not* being gorillas). This is not only a lavishly produced action-epic, but also a sentimental adventure as Tarzan and Jane return to the jungle to face a relentless evil.As a Tarzan writer, and as a lifelong fan, I absolutely loved it.

Lighthearted and fun with enough drama and emotional connection to make this a great summer movie. I had heard that the CGI was bad, saw no real evidence of this in the movie. On the contrary it was well done. I think that this Tarzan is much closer to what Burroughs had in mind. The critics cannot seem to see beyond the 1912 creation of this character and seem to focus on the relevancy and point of the movie. My wife asked me why every movie has to have a point so that the critics would like it. The point in this movie seems to be a thoughtful handling of an iconic character that arguably spawned almost every other superhero that we have today.

Legend Of Tarzan brings Lord Greystoke back to his beloved Africa. Of course no Tarzan movie would work with out the love of his life, Jane. There is also some historical content added to give the movie even more depth. Samuel Jackson is perfectly cast in his role as the real life George Washington Williams.

As the story unfolded, John did visit Congo on an invitation (from King Solomon) orchestrated by a mercenary (Capt Leon Rom) hired by King Solomon who was exploiting the Congolese people and the rich mineral resources of Congo. The true intention was to trade Tarzan off to an enemy Tribal leader (his son was killed by Tarzan) and get precious diamonds in return, to fund the King's Army. Tarzan however believed in his instinct and went to Congo to see for himself, the wrath brought upon by King Solomon on his tribesmen and Congolese people. The story takes an interesting turn when Capt Leon abducts Tarzan's wife Zane as a compensation (also as a hostage) after his futile attempt to capture John aka Tarzan. The rest of the movie reveals how John Clayton transforms himself into his wild avatar Tarzan and rescues his wife and eventually saves Congo from slavery and tyranny imposed by King Solomon.

Straight away I was thinking of how my favourite scenes from the previous movie would be brought back to life along with How the animals would look, if they Would talk, At what point would we hear the iconic Tarzan roar and of course how would the vine swinging look with today's cgi technology. In my opinion the animated storyline was a great foundation to work from and should have been ( for the majority at least) left the same. The trailer when released made me almost certain that that was going to be the case. Particularly after seeing The shot of the tree house over looking the ocean and the gorillas discovering Tarzan as a baby. However. . . . This story is being told very very very differently. The entire story I was hoping to see brought back to life has already come and gone. All You are treated to are multiple flashbacks throughout the film to relive certain moments such as how Tarzan met Jane, what happened to his parents and how he became one with the animals etc but they couldn't even get that in the slightest bit right. The first time you see Tarzan in this film you don't see the Tarzan we know and love we instead see a well dressed, well spoken Tarzan ( called John) who is discussing politics and events that are unfolding/about to unfold in Africa. Straight away I felt like I was watching what should have been a sequel to a revamped first film. Then who happens to appear . . . . Drum roll please . . . .who else but Samuel L Bloody Jackson 😫😫 Playing a character that was completely out of sync and in all honesty laughable. A character who found himself able to jump off cliffs and land safely In trees, stand and watch Tarzan take on a full sized gorilla with not a flicker of fear other than the occasion typical Jackson outburst. A character that if changed into different clothing could have been playing any off his previous roles. There was no adaptation to suit the film. David Yates directing this film reminds me of Roy Hodgson managing the England team during the Euros. Had a good base to work with but ultimately had no idea how to put it together so that it worked. You were only teased you with what could have or might have been. A fight scene fuelled on the loss of loved ones and raw emotion that only lasted a few minutes (with more than an underwhelming conclusion) would be an example of that. The characters had no depth and this was not the Tarzan and Jane I was hoping to see. That being said I think the choice of actors ( Samuel L Jackson being the exception) were the right choices for their parts but were portrayed completely wrong by the director and the direction of the film. Bitterly disappointed with the plot, the characters and also some of the visual affects. I think the majority of people who were expecting or hoping to see what I was hoping to see will be as well.",The Legend of Tarzan
451,jonathandmorgenstern,"""The Legend of Tarzan"" Deepens the Tarzan Legacy",9,10 July 2016,"Given the current socio-political divisive and racially tumultuous tone of this hot Summer in America, if ever there is a time for healing between peoples of various races and cultures, this is it. While critics pan it and cynics decry it, if one just goes with the flow and enjoys this movie without preconceptions, ""The Legend of Tarzan"" may be just the summer flick salve needed. As a boy in the 1950s I was enthralled by Johnnie Weissmuller's original film portrayals of Tarzan, King of The Jungle as the orphaned feral wild-child first adopted by the great apes and thereafter by all of Africa. ""The Legend of Tarzan"" is so souped-up in hyper-drive with the added component of historical and cultural nuance that it is like entering an alternative universe. Edgar Rice Burroughs' pulp fiction novels develop the character of Tarzan, the quintessential noble heroic character who is pure primal man of honor, protector of his woman Jane, his indigenous tribal friends and his beloved natural environment. The Legend of Tarzan is today's perfect family matinée reminiscent of days gone by when one went to movies for escapism, visual beauty, excitement and romanticism. Moreover, there are several important consciousness raising lessons also being offered.Fictional cinematic license was taken with the history and topography of the Congo region. However, to its credit, the plot-line focuses on the private exploitation and enslavement of the Congolese people by King Leopold II of Belgium in 1885. Moreover, the timely integration into ""The Legend of Tarzan"" of the real-life, but until now, little known American human rights activist hero being, U.S. Ambassador, Dr. Rev. George Washington Williams, (played by Samuel L. Jackson) is seamlessly accomplished and praiseworthy. Williams' life was astonishingly accomplished and remarkable. An African-American free-born in Pennsylvania in 1849, he was a proud 14 year old enlistee into the Union Army and fought in the final battles of the Civil War. Thereafter, Williams went to Mexico and joined the Republican army under the command of General Espinosa, fighting to overthrow Emperor Maximilian and became a commissioned officer. He returned to the U.S. and continued his military career for 5 years in the U.S. Army as a Buffalo Soldier in the Indian Territories. As a contrite wounded veteran he then studied law under President Taft's Father; became the first African-American graduate of Newton Theological Institution; was an Ordained Baptist Minister; published a monthly journal; authored of several notable treatises focusing on African- American history; was the first African-American elected to the Ohio Legislature; President Chester A. Arthur's then appointed him as Consul General to Haiti and was the man who in 1885, personally confronted, investigated first hand and thereafter internationally published an open-letter of condemnation to King Leopold II exposing his brutal exploitation of the Congolese people with a ""call and create an International Commission to investigate the charges herein preferred in the name of Humanity ..."". These creative liberties actually enhance the fictional Tarzan as a vehicle for change giving the icon an even more compelling, empathetic and politically relevant quality than ever before. The semiotic of the beloved returning prodigal son, as an anti- colonialist European nobleman in partnership with the real life African- American human rights activist at his side together as liberators of both people and animals while organically integrated into the lush wild ecosystem, gives the movie a qualitative spiritual depth that verges on inspirational. The combination of the 3D experience with superb CGI is mesmerizing. The high action fight scenes, the believable Tarzan vine swinging, the muscular physicality and depth of varied emotions of gorillas that is virtually in your face, up close and personal is masterful. The movie is visually breathtaking, spectacular and of epic proportions. I highly recommend seeing this movie for the whole family. It is both great entertainment, humanly heart warming politically astute and thought provoking which may prompt thereafter additional investigation and education by the viewer. What more could we expect or want from Hollywood? Kudos.",The Legend of Tarzan

Action scenes were awesome, with A.S. holding up his end quite well indeed. If you go in suspending disbelief, you can easily be caught up in the story, no matter how much you know or don't know about the original story. All the actors were great, believable, and I even teared up a few times in the dramatic scenes. You must have a taste for fantasy, or don't bother to see it.

What I didn't expect was the flimsy dialogue, scenes unconnected to the ""plot"" and such miserable drivel coming out of the mouths of the actors. I was also surprised by the pseudo environmentalist doctrine they weave into the plot. The babe is being taken away by the bad guys to her death and the only thing she can say is, ""Promise me you wont hurt the animals."" Really? The best line in the movie is when the black guy says, ""Can we just stop this?"" My sentiments exactly. The overly sensitive, crying, cannibal warlord was a bit too much.",The Legend of Tarzan

If you have never met him before, this is an introduction you will remember.It was fun, it was exciting and Alexander Skarsgard is amazing.

I sat during the initial intro, worrying the movie was not moving along fast enough to keep my family's interest. Then my brain got wrapped around the ""legend"", how it all began and where it was leading.This is a story within a story. Tarzan, the uncivilized boy/man raised by gorillas and the civilized and distinguished upper class man of English royalty. I loved Alexander Skarsgard's portrayal of a conflicted Tarzan, his eyes betraying his torment, as well as, his passion for Jane.I believe all movie ratings are a result of individual perception of what is expected. For me, I loved the movie and will definitely buy the DVD when released. My family enjoyed the movie, much to my surprise, so that should tell you something right there since they did not expect to like it. I rated it a 9 out of 10, only because I think the beginning seemed a little slow.... quiet, but was purposeful in it's setting the background.

The pace, setting and backstory of the film is one that made me relate to the characters and to the story of Tarzan. I went into this film thinking that it would simply be just another George of the Jungle, Tarzan-esque type of film. The movie shattered those preexisting stereotypes that I held.

It was a copy of avatar not only the general idea but small details too, coincidence? Don't think so. Tarzan's abs were clearly drawn in in some scenes. Mistakes like that are clearly noticeable, did the director even care? they just shot a movie because they shot a movie they said we have to make a movie in 2016 or else everyone will forget we exist.

SURE, (everyone's doing a s**t tons of remakes anyway) sounds awesome, let's join the bandwagon!"", and then, people flock to it like the nostalgia hungry things they are. This is not the problem. (Although remakes, s***ty horror movies, sequels, and movies based off books seems to be all there is anymore.) The problem is that they turned this idea into very poor excuse of a movie.Visuals: Visuals were great. Nothing wrong there. Scenes had good atmosphere, lighting, and effects. Some of these beautiful scenes were a little unnecessary but I guess they needed the run-time. Story: Boring. Boring boring BORING. The beginning before the title of the movie was shown was exciting and full of mystery in a way, but after the title, things went down hill. The story started becoming more bland, boring, and confusing. It was hard to keep myself from falling asleep or sighing whenever I expected something exciting to happen but nothing did. Coincidences and clichés appeared very often and just left me sighing and cringing.Characters: Ugh. Tarzan is the cliché brooding hero. Jane is just an annoying character. Washington Carver didn't really seem relevant? The others I guess were...""okay""? I just wasn't feeling any joy or interest watching any of these people. I don't know if that was what the writers were looking for but I didn't like it. I know this review is very broad, but I like short reviews that are to the point.

But he was viciously brutal and unforgiving to his enemies, while loyal, and honorable to his allies.This film was well cast. At 6'4"", Alexander Skarsgård is the perfect Tarzan. He is handsome, but no pretty boy, masculine, and charming. More importantly, he plays Tarzan as an intellect. Even the fight scenes we're well choreographed.

He's one of the great fictional characters of the 20th century, and many later characters were created using the basic framework created by Burroughs; every time you see one lone man face impossible odds and win, (Bond, Eastwood westerns, Die Hard, etc.) you're seeing the hero type Burroughs created. This movie is by far, the best Tarzan movie ever made, and the first to depict the hero as Burroughs invented him. Several ""reviewers"" try to dismiss Tarzan and this movie as ""racist""; clearly, they know little or nothing about the original character. If a fictional character survives long enough, they often become lampooned and reduced to comic status; this doesn't mean that the original character isn't great; sadly, we seem to delight in marginalizing our heroes.

Samuel L Jackson did we even need his character in the film at all? He added nothing to it, and I do like him as an actor. CGI was good. But I just found the whole film, boring and predictable with a rubbish story line, it was a sort of non film, nothing much going on, Tarzan had just the one look, he had no expressions whatsoever. In fact I can hardly remember the film and only watched it 4 days ago...",The Legend of Tarzan
480,dogman-55036,not a good movie,1,24 November 2016,"i watch this movie and tarzan gets beat up by a ape,what,what up with the lions being friends with tarzan,tarzan only had one lion as a friend. jane porter is a hotie,and that's the only thing going for this movie.jane porter in a bikini would have been better.bad movie have to have more lines on here to do a review.tarzan getting beat up by a ape may be he should go back to England.there was somes good parts but not many.bad guy gets jane and tarzan has to get her back and that's the end of this movie,so if you miss this movie no lost,where johnny when you need him.well i can not think of any thing more to say about this movie,so this good bye.",The Legend of Tarzan
481,zozimus-73220,Probably the best Tarzan movie so far.,8,18 December 2016,"Reviews for this movie frequently seem to suffer from one of three problems:1. The reviewer has never read, or has no understanding of, the source material. This is not a death knell in itself, since a movie should stand on its own merits, but it is off-putting. It's like someone with zero knowledge of WW2 reviewing Schindler's List and calling it ""unbelievable"". 2. Racism. White people and misogynists who can't handle independent women or black people seem unable to stomach the ""revisionist history"" presented by the film. They find it unbelievable and insulting to their understanding of racial and gender hierarchy. I don't have much to say about this except that I have contempt for such opinions. 3. Political correctness (for lack of a better term). People are upset that the hero of a story taking place in colonial Africa is white. I have some sympathy for this one, but not enough to accept it completely. Tarzan is not a colonist. Tarzan is an African. He was born in Africa and the first humans he had relationships with were Africans. He is a foreigner and a stranger in England, though he is by birth (no fault of his) an English Earl, a role he rejects. His status as an extraordinary hero and ex-ape make him the focus of the stories, obviously. The other characters are going to play a supporting role, but this does not guarantee that they will be subordinate or subservient. They are not. This movie actually gives Tarzan's African friends, and African history,a fairer shake than any previous Tarzan movie, and many non-Tarzan movies to boot. They are heroic in their own right, and even his African enemy is humanised, and given a realistic, human reason for being the antagonist. The conflict is on the human level, not racial. Tarzan's ""sidekick"", the historical figure played by Samuel Jackson, is, yes, the voice of the film's humorous moments, but he is also given some depth of character and motivation, describing an arc of personal redemption for his complicity in the North American Indigenous genocide. I would have loved for his character to be even better fleshed out, but you can't describe him as two- dimensional or some kind of Jim Crow character. The latter two points are often discussed at the expense of reviewing the actual film; this is a shame, as the movie itself is a decent action-adventure in its own right. The CGI animals are amazing, as is the entirely-constructed jungle (none of the movie was filmed in Africa, aside from some generic background shots). This is by far the most successful, interesting Tarzan movie ever. But, like another ERB franchise, the John Carter stories, it didn't seem to connect with a generation of moviegoers who didn't grow up on pulp action novels. This is an excellent Tarzan movie; a very good action film; a moderately successful movie about African history; and a pretty decent movie with role models who are women or non-caucasian. As a political manifesto (something it doesn't try to be) it may be a failure, but whatever. This film deserves a lot more love.",The Legend of Tarzan
482,uselessakkounts,Tarzan with a bit more African history behind it.,6,27 December 2016,"I can accept the movie for what it is - good entertainment. Just one more version of the legend of Tarzan. But then, Edgar Rice Burroughs was a great writer. Skarsgard did a good job. Margot Robbie was okay, but... A lot of animal and action CGI. Also visually beautiful when it comes to the countryside and mountains. My main criticism is Samuel L. Jackson. People, please, stop ruining potentially good movies by including Samuel Jackson. He was awful. Completely wrong for this movie. And to play an historical character like George Washington Williams, they should have found someone who would give the role, and person, some dignity. Waltz and Hounsou were excellent, as always.",The Legend of Tarzan
483,bradmckay,Everything I hoped it would be!,8,16 January 2017,"I can't believe so many people are bashing this film. I found it well worth my time. It was a great action film with a rich story (without being bogged down with all the backstory), and with characters with real depth. Alexander Skarsgård really brought Tarzan to life, speaking more through action than dialogue. Margot Robbie was excellent as usual, a strong-willed Jane fitting as the wife of a legend. The bond between them was well portrayed without feeling forced or going over the top. Plenty of action, strong performance by all the leads, excellent sets, locations and CGI, interesting story without being overly complicated, great musical score. This film has it all! By far the best adaptation of this classic legend I've ever seen!",The Legend of Tarzan
484,andromeda-75866,"A good fictional adventure thriller, but...",6,28 February 2017,"The saddest part of the movie is that it looked like the Africans prevailed. They didn't. The Belgian exploitation of the Congo is one of the worst genocides in history. Have a look at a book entitled King Leopold's Ghost. Historians allow for as many as fifteen million and no fewer than one million Africans murdered to satisfy Leopold's desire to make money from the production of rubber, not diamonds. All of us ought to be offended, not just Africans, that the movie made it look like the indigenous people needed the courage, strength, and decency of one white, rich, Englishman to resist exploitation. It is as ridiculous as managing wild gorillas, lions, and wildebeests as if they were toys in a video game. And gorillas swinging through trees? Really?All that aside, this movie is a pleasant distraction. Yes, it is comic book grade entertainment, but there is a reason comics have survived for so long. They have for the same reason the original Tarzan books were successful. Life is long enough to allow for hours here and there to be frivolous. And most of the actors are fun to look at. So suspend your need for realism and enjoy.",The Legend of Tarzan

486,gaylordfullerton,my view of this movie...,6,21 May 2017,"the movie was pretty good but it was supposed to be the legend of Tarzan not the Legend of John!!!! they could have thrown in a few comments when Jane was captured, like they they were in trouble now!!! stuff like that!!!! it could have been much better they need new writers for the next one!!!!! all in all I liked it but it could have been much better!!!",The Legend of Tarzan
487,mn_cr,It's a wonderful film,10,25 October 2017,"This movie turns into a legend of TARZAN and in it Tarzan, having acclimated to life in London, is called back to his former home in the jungle to investigate the activities at a mining encampment. for me this film is the best film of the year 2016,Because it is characterized by imagination and the element of suspense and pleasure in watching. as it leads you to another world far from reality. And his wonderful story that affects onlookers,It is one of the finest films I have ever seen",The Legend of Tarzan
488,scarroll-8,Finally a Burroughs' Tarzan movie!,10,10 July 2016,"I've been a fan of the character of Tarzan since childhood when my Dad took me to see the Mike Henry movies at the theater. Through television I then watched the older movies, devouring them all. Later on I discovered the Burroughs books and wondered for decades why no one ever really attempted to capture that specific and superior vision in a movie. Thankfully, The Legend of Tarzan corrects that and gives us the best genuine Tarzan adaptation ever committed to film. Is it perfect? Unfortunately, no. But so much of it is just simply ""right"" that I can forgive some occasionally (and only occasionally) dodgy CGI and an uneven pace. This is a wonderful piece of old-fashioned action adventure filmmaking that I had thought lost forever and I couldn't recommend it more highly.",The Legend of Tarzan
