0,SnoopyStyle,solid heart,7,3 February 2019,"Teddy has been naughty ever since the death of his father. His younger sister Kate is still a true believer in Santa Claus. When she discovers video evidence of Santa, she forces Teddy to help her film him on his gift giving tour. They do manage to capture Santa Claus (Kurt Russell) on video and stowaway on his sleight. That's when their adventure begins.Kurt Russell delivers his version of an irreverent Santa Claus. I do like him and I do like the kids. There is real heart when heart is called for. The elves are a little weird. They would be better as more cuddly. The big misstep are the criminals and Teddy stealing a car. It's a little too dark. The bad guys have no reason to kidnap the kid anyways. I buy them stealing the bag but kidnapping is an unnecessary step too far. They should just punch his lights out and walk away with the bag. They can still do a lot of the same stuff except Teddy would be searching the streets for the bag. I like for some of the darker aspects to be pulled back like throwing the bag into the furnace. This is a nice light sentimental Christmas story.",The Christmas Chronicles
1,Prismark10,Kurt delivers,6,13 January 2019,"Teddy and Kate are two squabbling kids who try to film Santa Claus and end up helping him to deliver presents on Christmas Eve. They need to do it in time or else the Christmas spirit is gone.These days you get lots of bland Hallmark type movies made for a television market that offers little that is new or different.Credit has to go to The Christmas Chronicles as it adds some crash, bang and wallop. There is even a message underneath as Teddy has reached an age where he does not believe in Father Christmas and even got involved in petty crime.The film steals a lot from other movies. There is more than a hint of Elf, Home Alone and Miracle on 34th Street.Kurt Russell is having a hoot as Santa. He even gets to sing like Elvis.The Christmas Chronicles is fun and one of the better festive films in recent years.",The Christmas Chronicles
2,kosmasp,Sweet Santa,7,28 April 2019,"This is one of the sweeter and more family friendly efforts done by Netflix. So those who say there is only violence and general adult themed productions, should take note. Russell Crowe has a lot of fun playing Santa. But let's be clear, this does not base itself in logic. So if you are a cynic or rank it/rate it with the real world as a measure, you won't have any fun at all.It starts with how Santa is discovered by two kids. And how it all is handled. Again take it for what it is. This was made with kids in mind. If you find your inner child, you can more than enjoy this ride (no pun intended). And there are even some fun nuggets/presents for adults too",The Christmas Chronicles
3,classicsoncall,"""Live and in person. One night only!""",7,3 December 2020,"This is definitely a kids movie, but you can do yourself a favor and watch it if you're an adult. Kurt Russell made me laugh as Santa Claus, he really took on the role and ran with it, more in keeping with the Saint Nicholas character of old and not the Coca Cola version. When he broke out with 'Christmas Time Pretty Baby' in the prison cell, well that just cracked me up. Along with the jailbird chorus girls, they really livened the picture up. I don't know about those elves though, they were a lot like those pesky little creatures in ""Gremlins"", but I know they'd be a hoot for the youngsters. I didn't quite perceive the chemistry between young Kate (Darby Camp) and older brother Teddy (Judah Lewis); they wound up being okay in their roles but I sensed something missing. The story probably could have been helped by a larger role for Goldie Hawn as Mrs. Claus, but I think that's taken care of with the sequel in ""The Christmas Chronicles 2"". Sure would like to see Russell do another take on Elvis, although this wasn't his first time. You can check him out with Kevin Costner in ""3000 Miles to Graceland"", but that's not a Christmas movie. Here he had a two-fer - he did Elvis and spoke Elvish!",The Christmas Chronicles
4,jboothmillard,The Christmas Chronicles,5,5 January 2019,"At the beginning of December, The Guardian newspaper did a top ten list, ranking the Movie Santa Clauses, and the one featured in this Netflix movie ranked number 4. Then I saw the poster on the back of the Radio Times, I was most interested to watch it, directd by Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, Percy Jackson & the Lightning Thief). Basically, in Lowell, Massachusetts, Christmas has been a treasured time of the year for the Pierce family, until 2018 when father Doug (Oliver Hudson), a firefighter, dies in the line of duty. Mother Claire (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) struggles to hold the family together, oldest child Teddy (Judah Lewis) gets himself in trouble, but youngest child Kate (Darby Camp), who believes in Santa Claus, is determined to keep the Christmas spirit alive. On Christmas Eve 2018, Claire is forced to do some work, leaving Teddy to look after Kate, the little girl is watching old videos of her father, and notices an arm in the background near the Christmas tree. She is sure it is Santa, and wants Teddy's help to prove he exists, capturing him on camera, she blackmails Teddy as she has footage of him stealing a car, together they set traps and set up a camera in the closet where they wait. Kate is woken by a bell ringing and sees Santa in the living room, but he leaves before Teddy can see him, but then they hear movement on the roof, and outside they are amazed to see a sleigh and reindeer floating above them. They see Santa hopping from house to house at high speed going down chimneys delivering presents, Kate decides to climb up into the sleigh, Teddy reluctantly follows. Santa eventually returns, and Kate makes her presence known, startling Santa and the reindeer, causing them to lose control, the teleporter to send them off-course, Santa loses his hate and the presents sack to fall out, and the sleigh crashes. They crash land in Chicago, Illinois, Santa (Kurt Russell) officially introduces himself, he looks different to what they expected, he must get the presents back and delivered before the night is over, or Christmas spirit will be lost, like in the Dark Ages. Without his hat, he has lost his magical high speed and cannot fit into tight spaces, so the children are forced to help him. They go into a bar hoping that patrons will help them, Santa, knowing all names around the world, reminds many of them of their Christmas wishes, but no-one offers to help. So, they steal a 2014 Dodge Challenger, which itself was already stolen by the ex-con bartender on the ""Naughty List Hall of Fame"". Santa builds a makeshift radio to listen to the police frequency, and sure enough they hear a report about the reindeer, but police officers Dave Poveda (Martin Roach) and Mikey Jameson (Lamorne Morris) pull them over for speeding. While Santa is taken to the police station, Kate finds and rides the reindeer through the city, and with Teddy they manage to locate the sack of presents. Kate clinbs inside the bag, she winds up teleported to the North Pole, where she is found by the elves, but being a ""True Believer"" they agree to help her. Teddy is taken, along with the bag, by a gang of thugs, the elves appear from inside before they can do anything naughty, they then work together to repair Santa's damaged sleigh. Meanwhile, in jail, Santa has magically pulled out a bunch of musical instruments for other inmates in the holding cell, they perform musical number ""Santa Claus Is Back in Town"", most of the people are also believers, the unconvinced officer is turned after receiving a call from his partner. Santa is released, and returns to the repaired sleigh, and gets his magical hat back, but he has only one hour to deliver the remaining presents before the morning. The children agree to help him, with the elves they are able to move at faster speed, the final gifts are dropped off with only milliseconds to spare. Santa drops Kate and Teddy back home before their mother returns, he gives Teddy his hat as a memento, showing he didn't really need it, and he leaves exclaiming ""Ho Ho Ho"", which he previously stated he was a myth. Kate is ecstatic that she has recorded many of the night's events on her camcorder, but she finds the tape has been taken, Teddy remarks that Santa would never have allowed her to keep it. When Claire returns, the family find the house decorated like Doug used to, they open presents, Kate gets a skateboard she asked for, and Teddy asked to see his father again, Santa could not give him this, but he gives him a bauble, which he hangs on the tree, he is happy to find to see his father's reflection appear. Back in the North Pole, Santa is updating his book of True Believers, adding Teddy's name to it, Mrs. Claus (Goldie Hawn) remarks about the adventure she is aware he has had, and they decide to watch Kate's video tape together. Russell makes for a fun, freewheeling and more modern Father Christmas, his rock singing scene is the highlight, the cameo from his long-time partner Hawn is cool as well, it is a nice simple story of two kids almost ruining Christmas, joining St. Nick to save it, and many magical and chaotic things happening over the course of one night, the special effects are good, the computerised elves are obviously aiming for lovers of Minions, it makes you laugh enough, and it does get you into the mood for the Christmas, something for all the family, a reasonably fun seasonal comedy adventure. Worth watching!",The Christmas Chronicles
5,paul_haakonsen,This was simply amazing...,8,25 December 2018,"Now, initially I had some aversion to sitting down and watching ""The Christmas Chronicles"" even though it was readily available on Netflix for me to watch. Why? Well, it is a Christmas movie, and they have an overwhelming tendency to be so sappy that even pine tress go ""no, I ain't touching that sticky thing"", and also because I didn't really think Kurt Russell would be suited for a Christmas movie.My curiosity got the better of me and I decided to watch in on December 24th, you know, just to get into sappy Christmas mood. And let me tell you, I am really happy that I decided to watch ""The Christmas Chronicles"".Why? Well, first of all, this movie was devoid of the usual Christmas sappy storyline where a girl falls in love and have to traverse hardships and always end up in the arms of the man that is out of reach on Christmas morning. This movie was all fun, all excitement and all Yule tide spirits. I actually will go as far as saying that ""The Christmas Chronicles"" actually have potential to become a Christmas classic - one of the type of Christmas movies that you watch year after year, up alongside ""National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation"".""The Christmas Chronicles"" is definitely a family movie, but it is also a movie that you can enjoy without the family around you, because it caters to a wide array of audience. There is something in the movie for everybody.There is actually a great amount of fun, action and thrills throughout the course of the movie, and you don't feel that the movie ever loses its momentum or becomes slowed down and turning dull. I must admit that I was wholeheartedly entertained from start to end.Now, let's venture on to the role of Santa Claus as portrayed by Kurt Russell. I grew up watching him in action movies, so I didn't really want to embrace him in a role such as this. But I was proven so wrong, because he did this so amazingly well. He was really a nice cast for the role, and he brought his own rugged charm and spirit to the Santa character, and I loved that. So my Christmas hat off for Mr. Russell in his performance in ""The Christmas Chronicles"".The singing and dancing scene was something I initially felt weird about, but oh man that quickly caught on and grew on you. And I ended up loving that scene, because it is full of energy, it is a catchy song, and Kurt Russell delivers the song and dance so well.All in all, ""The Christmas Chronicles"" is a movie that you owe to yourself and your family to sit down, either alone or together, and watch, because it is definitely a fun and wholehearted Christmas movie.This movie definitely helped put some cheer on my day...",The Christmas Chronicles
6,blanche-2,great Christmas movie,9,15 February 2021,"Kurt Russell makes a delightful Santa in The Christmas Chronicles. Two kids set up a video so they can prove Santa is real. They wind up in his sleigh trying to save Christmas. Along the way they have adventures.Good family film, wonderful performances and special effects.A good film for the whole family.",The Christmas Chronicles
7,BandSAboutMovies,Kurt is a fun Santa!,6,18 December 2018,"There hasn't really been a new Christmas tradition since Elf. Well, I don't know, your family's traditions may include other films. In our house, we watch National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation (and Black Christmas when the parents go to sleep). Netflix is hoping that this new Santa story will be one you come back to more than a few Christmases from now.Kate and Teddy Pierce aren't expecting a good Christmas. Their father died this year, they've been drifting apart and Teddy has even gotten into stealing cars. Yeah, for a seasonal movie, this movie gets dark super quick.When going through old videos, Kate doesn't just see her parents (the dad is played by Goldie Hawn's son Oliver Hudson and the mom is Kimberly Williams-Paisley from Father of the Bride), but a glimpse of Santa. The plan to catch the spirit of Christmas in the act turns into an adventure where they have to save the holiday.Your mileage may vary as to how much you enjoy this, but I was in the right holiday mood to like it. I really enjoyed how Elvis was such a part of Russell's Santa. After all, Elvis and the actor have been linked throughout their careers. Kurt Russell's first movie was the Elvis starring It Happened at the World's Fair. And the actor really turned heads when he became an adult and played the King in the John Carpenter directed 1979 TV movie Elvis. Since then, Russell was the voice of a young Elvis in Forrest Gump and an Elvis dressing thief in 3000 Miles to Graceland. In this movie, Santa sings the Elvis version of ""Santa Claus is Back in Town"" while he's in jail, accompanied by Steven Van Zandt's Disciples of Soul.There are also some funny inside jokes, as the first name read from the book of naughty and nice, as well as the kid who asks for a snowboard, are both named for Kurt's grandsons Bing and Ryder.As silly as the CGI elves were and as expected as the reveal of Mrs. Claus was, I was in a really forgiving mood and enjoyed their antics. What can I say? It's almost Christmas.Becca would like to add that many of her friends feel uncomfortable finding Santa so hot. She said they should just enjoy how good he looks.",The Christmas Chronicles
8,CinemaSerf,Joyous family Christmas capers,7,9 December 2020,"Kurt Russell (or is it really Kris Kristofferson) is as good a ""Santa Claus"" as I've seen on the big screen since the inimitable Edmund Gwenn in 1947, I reckon.... Anyway, in this outing Kimberly Williams-Paisley (""Claire"") is a young girl who accidentally catches a glimpse of a red sleeved arm near her Christmas tree with her video camera. Intrigued, she and her sceptical older brother ""Teddy"" (Judah Lewis) set out to prove once and for all what we've always known: of course ""Santa"" is real!! The ensuing escapades are fun and engaging; the dialogue is light-hearted and mischievous, and though it's a wee bit long and it certainly runs to sentiment a little too much towards the end, there are good performances from both the kids and Russell is clearly having fun as he and his elves make merry this Christmas... It's colourful, charming and cheery - nothing to be cynical about.",The Christmas Chronicles
9,Calicodreamin,Cute Christmas movie!,6,30 November 2019,"The Christmas chronicles is a cute story of two kids who find themselves helping Santa to save Christmas, after they basically wreck it... Kurt Russell plays an awesome Santa Claus. The acting isn't overly great, and the storyline isn't the most well planned. But it really is a cute movie and makes for an enjoyable watch, with some great heartwarming moments. Plus a lovely surprise with Mrs. Claus.",The Christmas Chronicles
10,morrison-dylan-fan,Escape from the North Pole.,7,13 January 2019,"Whilst doing well finding Christmas Horror gems, the only main non-X-Mas Horror I had caught on Netflix was the disappointing El Camino Christmas (2017). Browsing Netflix on Christmas Eve,I stumbled on a fun-looking trailer for their main holiday season offering of the year, which led to me discovering Big Trouble in Little Lapland.View on the film:For his first non-animated project, director Clay Kaytis is joined by Robert Zemeckis's main cinematographer Don Burgess in wrapping up a jolly slick atmosphere of Christmas red splashed all over the screen. Although the Minion- wannabe CGI elves look out of place due to the CGI taking away the warmth more fitting practical effects would have given them, Kaytis does very well matching the traditional X-Mas appearance with off-beat with colourful, Elvis-style music interlude and noisy gadgets used by Santa and the Kids to try and save Christmas.Sneaking Kate and Teddy into Santa's sleigh, the writers send them off on a charmingly funny action adventure, which in a similar fashion to The Santa Clause (1994) pulls the cracker on peoples expectations of St. Nick in funny exchanges over Santa refusing to say Ho Ho Ho, and remember the presents requested from everyone he meets (even when they are adults!) Gifting the message of believing in yourself, the writers hold it from snowing the rest of the movie in by having it mentioned during the most frantic moments of the adventure. Fittingly a family occasion with son Oliver Hudson and partner Goldie Hawn joining, Kurt Russell brings magic to the film with a wonderful take on Santa which keeps the warmth jolly whilst lighting up a sarcastic streak and a welcomed Elvis impression intermission as Santa,Teddy and Kate (played by the sweet Darby Camp and Judah Lewis) start to believe in saving Christmas.",The Christmas Chronicles
11,deloudelouvain,Finally they can stop showing Home Alone on Christmas.,7,26 December 2018,"I'm not going to say that Christmas movies are the things I'm waiting for or that get me thrilled. But since it was Christmas I gave this one a shot and I didn't regret it. Based on it being a Christmas movie, with the usual feelgood cheesy moments, it's still an entertaining movie. Instead of watching Home Alone for the 100th time on Christmas we now have a movie that hopefully will put Home Alone in the closet forever. The Christmas Chronicles is an entertaining family movie perfect as a Christmas movie. Kurt Russell was perfect as Santa Clause. The special effects were not exaggerated but good.",The Christmas Chronicles
12,Lejink,The Hunt For Big Red In December,8,4 December 2018,"Netflix's new Christmas movie for 2018 is a seasonal joy. Sure the idea of Santa being caught in the act on Christmas Eve, then getting grounded by two young children so that, yikes! Christmas itself is at risk isn't original, but it's put over here with lots of seasonal goodwill, style and no little panache so that I predict it will itself become at least a minor Christmas classic in years to come.A big, bluff, larger than life character like Santa naturally requires a big, bluff, larger than life performance and Kurt Russell gives it just that. He looks great with his big white beard in that big red suit and is in his element especially when he rocks up Elvis's ""Santa Claus Is Back In Town"" (in the jailhouse of course) reminding us he got his own big break all those years ago in the biopic of the King ""This Is Elvis"". There's also a pleasing cameo by his own celebrity partner, right at the end, as Santa's long-suffering wife.The two kids caught up in the Christmas rush with old Kris perform creditably too, playing down the cute, schmaltzy sentimentality it would have been so easy to overload on screen while there's a nice grounded turn too by Kimberly Williams as their recently widowed mother, struggling to control her up until then quarrelsome siblings.The special effects are just fine especially Santa's down-the-chimney routine and the airborne shots above Christmas-bedecked Chicago. There's also a car-chase, a cute army of elves and reindeers (go on, name them!), some sharp, topical humour (listen for the ""fake news"" reference), a neat running gag egging Santa to drop his famous catchphrase just once, another about his long-held distaste for his corpulent image on the classic soft drink can and a nice toasted-marshmallow-warm ending which might just have you wiping your eyes to clear away some of that winter frost.Just about my only fault with it would be the flatly anonymous title for the film, surely the more exciting ""Santa Claus Is Back In Town"" would have been more appropriate, but I urge anyone needing a seasonal pick-me-up to watch this one, it's one of the better Christmas gifts you'll get this year.",The Christmas Chronicles
13,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Santa Claus is coming to town.,6,21 December 2020,"'The Christmas Chronicles (2018)' is a very classic sort of Christmas caper, the kind of thing that could have been released in the late nineties or early noughties. As such, it's a bit hokey. However, it's also quite enjoyable when it gets going, capable of whisking you along on its adventure seemingly without all that much effort. It takes quite a while before everything settles into place; it's only when Russel's no-qualms Santa comes into play that things really pick up steam. Still, there's a good chunk of the thing that delivers exactly what you want it to. This segment is occasionally chuckle-worthy and charming, held together by genre-defining tropes and a fairly likeable set of leads. It's around the time that it reveals its mischievous, minion-esque elves that things take a turn for the worse, though. The plot stalls almost to a complete stop and revels in some really odd moments - such as a protagonist being kidnapped and threatened with death (not only by his kidnappers but also by a chainsaw-wielding elf). As this is happening, Saint Nick is starring in his own bizarre music number which doesn't really gel with the flick's established tone (especially as it's cut together with the aforementioned scene of threat). Thankfully, the movie pulls itself together before it heads into its finale. It finishes on a satisfying note that wraps everything up with a neat Christmas bow. Overall, the affair is generally entertaining despite its flaws. When it's good, it's actually really good. Still, its issues do have an undeniable impact. They don't ruin the piece, but they knock it down a peg or two. 6/10",The Christmas Chronicles
14,ThomasDrufke,Kurt Was Born to Play Santa,5,30 December 2018,"I can't see myself ever sitting down to watch this again, however, I do get a certain joy out of watching well-respected actors having fun in roles that are incredibly goofy and tonally different from their previous work. Just look at all the actors in the Mamma Mia movies, did you ever think you would see guys like Colin Firth do some of those moves like he does during 'Dancing Queen'? Sometimes actors are just meant for certain roles, and I feel like Kurt Russell was born to play Santa Claus. The charm and charisma he brings, for the most part, overpowers the brutally cheesy and awful dialogue. If Netflix didn't already have a track record of producing these types of films, I would have thought this was a Disney Channel original film.5.4/10",The Christmas Chronicles
15,cricketbat,A fun holiday film for the family,7,31 December 2018,"Christmas Chronicles caught me by surprise. Not because it was so good, but because it wasn't that bad.

The comedy falls a little flat and there's a very cheesy musical number near the end, but overall I found this to be a fun holiday film for the family.",The Christmas Chronicles
16,secondtake,Some great moments in a not always great movie,6,14 December 2018,"Christmas Chronicles (2018)First, go ahead and watch this with normal joyous holiday cheer. It's fun and Kurt Russell as Santa is just peachy and funny.
But as a more critical or demanding viewer: what a roller coaster! There are parts that are inspired and funny and show the potential for a true classic. And there are parts that are just dumb and dumber, not filler but worse, trying too hard to be funny, lacking the right pace. I found myself perked up by the great moments and groaning in the not so great ones. Too bad!
One problem has to be the two kids, who are cute but lack that extra spark that makes them inhabit the movie.
The story, for all its potential, is kind of mash-up of ideas both homey and mystical. It tries to be everything and do everything. What it does pull off is the basic concept (no spoiler here) of a couple of kids getting in on Santa's delivery system Christmas Eve. Lots and lots of potential there.",The Christmas Chronicles

Best Christmas present ever!!,8,25 December 2019,"Kurt Russell who plays the modern day real life Santa Claus (who doesn't do ""Ho Ho Ho"") will be another annual film Christmas Classic along side (1946) It's A Wonderful Life with Jimmy Stewart, (1947) Miracle on 34th Street with Edmund Gwenn, and (1951) A Christmas Carol (aka Scrooge) with Alastair Sim. It brought back that Christmas""y"" warm fuzzy feeling in the belly of Mrs. Shullivan and I, and tears welled up as well.The two kids who purposely hitch a ride in Santa's sleigh on Christmas Eve while Santa is in the midst of delivering the world's presents initially cause Santa and his reindeer havoc and a slight delay for Santa.

24,lisafordeay,A real surprise for a TV movie,8,28 November 2018,"The Christmas Chronicles is the latest Netflix movie directed by Angry Birds Clay Katis(who also was an animator for Frozen and Tangled) and is produced by no other than film director legend Chris Columbus and tells the story of 2 kids named Teddy and Kate who celebrate Christmas every year by recording a video of themselves with their parents. But when tragedy strikes between the 2 kids which force them to argue alot,the youngest decides to watch a video that she recorded when she spots Santa Clause.Kate decides to do another video of Santa Clause up close only for it to backfire when she climbs up on his sleigh along with her brother Teddy and they end up meeting the jolly man himself played by Kurt Russell. With just 24 hours till Christmas ends can the kids and Santa save Christmas by bringing back the sleigh and get help from Santa's elves?
Overall this was a real surprise for me. I heard some people disliking it but for me I ended up loving it. Kurt Russell is excellent as Santa Clause along with the 2 kid actors who surprisingly weren't annoying.The premise keeps you on the edge of your seat in my opinion and the special effects are beautiful. I consider this a classic and definitely one to track down on Netflix for this Christmas season.Also features Kimberly Paisley from Father of The Bride,Oliver Hudson(Kate Hudson's brother) and even a surprise cameo in the end by Goldie Hawn as Mrs Clause.

27,drqshadow-reviews,As Vacant and Empty as the Most Generic Greeting Cards,3,4 January 2019,"Kurt Russell gets to clown around in a Santa suit, as he drags two irritating children around Chicago in search of a few misplaced magical accessories. It's basically a Hallmark Channel movie with the added lure of Snake Plissken guiding a hovering sleigh through the sky. I was hoping it might function as something more than that, maybe a winking satire of that breed of neutered, smothering, saccharine family flicks. Nope, what you see is what you get.Russell is truly the life of the party, magnetic in most every scene, but his enthusiasm only shines a beacon on the weaknesses of those around him. The kids are especially bad; no warmth, spirit or flavor to their parts. They might as well have been reading from a teleprompter. Poor effects, a drab plot, holes big enough to ride a reindeer through, a heavy-handed message and one loud musical number that leans way into cheeseball territory.

29,CubsandCulture,Yes it is cheesy but that is what makes it a new Holiday favorite,10,7 December 2018,"This is predictable but heartwarming. It is funny but silly. It is charming but pat. Everyone learns a valuable lessons. Family tensions are dissolved. And there are oh so many gags. All of which make the perfect movie to have on during the holidays.Sure a lot of the credit goes to Russell for turning in a unique spin on the iconic character. But for my money the director and screenwriter both keep the film light, engaging and thread the needle between holiday cheese and cloying sentimentality rather well.

31,r96sk,Perfectly suitable for the festive period,8,6 December 2020,"Fun film, perfectly suitable for the festive period.I do enjoy Kurt Russell, I like most of the films that I've seen him in and this is another one to add to the list. He's great in the lead role, very much carrying the film. The other actors could've been better cast, but are still passable in their respective roles. There are also cameos for Goldie Hawn and Steven Van Zandt.The special effects are pleasant, the reindeer look alright but it's the elves that look the best. Plot-wise it's fine, nothing to shout about but it still makes for more than satisfactory viewing - they get the Xmas vibe right. There's only one scene I didn't rate, it involves a jail, yet it still kinda worked - in a cheesy way, of course.Without Russell I'd be rating 'The Christmas Chronicles' lower, admittedly. Still, an enjoyable film.",The Christmas Chronicles
32,aidanratesmovies,"A simple, but fun enough Christmas flick. Kurt Russel shines!",6,23 March 2019,"Kurt Russell shines as Santa in one of the few decent enough Christmas comedies we have seen in the last few years. The plot is predictable, and talk about thin, and the acting is mostly subpar otherwise, but the film will keep you entertained with its sense of optimacy and fun gags that won't be on the nose as much as you may think. For a world where there are too many christmas movies and their sequels on repeat until the season is over, this is certainly breath of fresh air.

39,areatw,A fresh and enjoyable Christmas flick,7,25 December 2019,"'The Christmas Chronicle' is a enjoyable Christmas film that is successful at bringing fresh ideas to the genre. As comedy Christmas movies go, it's one of the best to come out in recent years. There are plenty of laughs for viewers of all ages and many of the jokes are fresh and topical, which was surprising but definitely a positive.The plot is nothing special - a pretty generic and predictable adventure story, but it's fine for light Christmas viewing for the family. The main characters are likable and are the main reason the film is as enjoyable as it is. I thought Kurt Russell was brilliant as Santa. He's both funny and endearing and really makes the role his own.Will 'The Christmas Chronicles' go down as a classic? Probably not.

41,phubbs,The Christmas Chronicles,6,1 December 2018,"Ho, Ho...Ho?A Netflix movie with a title that kinda suggests a cinematic universe? The hell you say. Anyway I think its fair to say that most of you should guess what the premise of this flick is gonna be. It this the usual Santa schtick or is there some kind of surprise to be had?Wait for it!! Deep breath!! Aaand...no it's the usual Santa schtick, sorry. Bottom line, a widow is getting over the recent death of her husband which has of course led to problems in the home with her two kids. Her daughter is generally OK but constantly watches old recordings of her father and fights with her elder brother who has gotten mixed in with a bad crowd and is stealing cars! Nevertheless as you might expect on Christmas Eve they both decide to try and catch Santa and end up fudging up old Saint Nick's plans good and proper. Thusly they all have to work together to save Christmas (ugh!).So I basically heard about this and wasn't overly bothered at first but when I saw Kurt Russell standing in that Jack Burton-esque pose on the poster, I was sold. Yes I saw this movie solely based on the fact that Russell was Santa. Had this been anyone else I probably wouldn't have bothered. But is Russell worth the admission? Well yes and no. Firstly yes it was inspired to cast Russell as Santa. I would never have thought of that as Russell just doesn't leap out at me as a Santa type guy. But blow me he sure as hell looks the part with his thick wavy hair dyed grey and white and that glorious beard of his. My only real complaint would be he looks too good, too fit and rugged to be Santa. Is that bad?Admittedly Russell can only work with what he's given and that's not entirely anything original let's be frank. The whole secret Santa thing has been done to death over the decades and there really is little to bring to the table now. So with that said yes everything that happens is kinda neat but totally 'been there, done that, seen it, and bought the t-shirt'. His slay typically has all the modern day technological gadgets. His reindeer do what most other magical reindeer do in these films. Santa can magically zoom about in a flash of CGI. Santa also has magical powers like a magician. He uses some kind of time portal to travel around the world. And his sack of presents is bottomless which also leads to his elf driven workshop...I think. Either that or the elf homeworld or Santa's grotto, not actually sure.We also have the usual reoccurring questions that pop up with these Christmas adventures. How come no one has seemingly EVER seen or exposed Santa before? Until now. He roams about in this movie using his powers and chatting about his unique role quite happily, so one assumes he's always done this, yet nothing has ever cropped up? No news reports, witnesses, or video evidence of any kind? Surely by now Santa would have been exposed. At the start of the adventure they just leave the slay where it crashed, just like that! Yet no one comes across it? No one comes across the large lost sack of presents just hanging in a tree in the middle of the city. No one has ever seen any of the elves (which are essentially cutesy copies of 'Gremlins') etc...Basically, with the amount of magic that flies about the place you'd just assume it was impossible that Santa would still remain a secret.And I haven't even mentioned the song and dance routine yet! Yes in one of the more original aspects of this movie Russell dons some shades and thumps out a little Christmas number with the help of a small backing band. Despite it all looking very Blues Brothers-like, very quickly any film buff will recognise Russell's Presley-esque techniques which he displayed back in 1979 for John Carpenter's TV movie 'Elvis'. So what we have is Kurt Russell, dressed as Santa, essentially doing Elvis, epic much? But once again this kinda makes you wonder how on earth this guy has managed to remain hidden when he does things like this and doesn't even try to hide his identity (he magically flies up a vent in a puff of red glitter at the end).It also amused me how Santa allowed the young girl to record almost everything on her old camcorder. Sure he takes the tape in the end but still, kinda risky. As for the young duo that accompanies Santa, well they're just your bog standard kids really. The girl is all happy happy, totally believes everything and is full of wonder, rainbows, and unicorn poo. Whilst the elder boy is of course more doubtful, cynical, and harder to convince. A lot of which is down to him struggling to cope with the loss of his father. But as the adventure progresses the duo (mainly the boy) must learn to help each other, be nice, use their brains, and believe in the spirit of Christmas (naturally). Its all about emotions, feelings, and being nice...all that cliched gooey crap. They might have been in a race against the clock but there's always time to stop for some sentimental schmaltz.Of course you know exactly how everything will turn out in the end with Santa and the kids. Kinda silly how they ruin the story by essentially hinting at the fact that everything was a setup by Santa to merely get these kids back on track with their mother. Then even more ridiculous when Santa essentially looks towards the camera and suggests he and Mrs. Claus watch the adventure he just had with the kids (all recorded on that old camcorder), which is basically saying to us the audience to keep rewatching this movie. At the same time suggesting it will become a new Christmas classic, we'll see Netflix.So overall it's cliched, predictable, and completely unoriginal. The effects are acceptable but obvious CGI and greenscreen abound especially for the slay sequences. The youngsters are fine, the elves are oddly violent (chainsaw??), and Santa's long red coat is leather. So yes as you may well have expected its all about Russell and his hip blues singin' Saint Nick. I can honestly say without Russell this would be just another dull jingle bells without the fun. So put simply, it's worth seeing for Russell and that's it, the rest is complete meh.6/10",The Christmas Chronicles
42,Holt344,"One of the decade's best Christmas movies, a masterpiece",10,15 December 2018,"The first 10 minutes sets the mood and tone for the movie, showing off the characters, how likeable they are. The two siblings are great and makes for some great family Christmas drama. For a Christmas movie it's actually original, the humour is natural and that's my favorite kind. Kurt Russell most likely ad libbed the jokes and he did a great job with the overall comedy and acting, truly becoming the new era's Santa Claus in movies. With him knowing literally everyone, makes for some fun jokes and the writers made it believable. The rest of the cast is great, also throwing in Martin Roach as a police officer, golden. Great special effects and the design for the Santa Sledge was perfect. The elfs is one of a kind, straight from a Disney movie which I kinda liked.This is truly a Christmas movie for all ages, young and old, you can never get too much of the magical nature of the Christmas spirit and Santa Claus.

43,eminkl,As vacant and empty as the most generic greeting cards,3,17 April 2020,"Kurt Russell gets to clown around in a Santa suit, as he drags two irritating children around Chicago in search of a few misplaced magical accessories. It's basically a Hallmark Channel movie with the added lure of Snake Plissken guiding a hovering sleigh through the sky. I was hoping it might function as something more than that, maybe a winking satire of that breed of neutered, smothering, saccharine family flicks. Nope, what you see is what you get. Russell is truly the life of the party, magnetic in most every scene, but his enthusiasm only shines a beacon on the weaknesses of those around him. The kids are especially bad; no warmth, spirit or flavor to their parts. They might as well have been reading from a teleprompter. Poor effects, a drab plot, holes big enough to ride a reindeer through, a heavy-handed message and one loud musical number that leans way into cheeseball territory.",The Christmas Chronicles
44,rzajac,Amazing how NETFLIX is trying to cover all the bases,8,25 November 2018,"First: Enjoyed the flick! It was a sort of well constructed Hallmark-style feelgood Xmas special! It teetered on the edge of outright cornball, on the verge of teetering on over into that chasm from time to time... but (by my lights) always managed to pull back in the Nick o' time!So, if you're in the mood to watch a decent Xmas type fantasy special, check it out.But this was, for me, the No.2 in a 1-2 punch regarding Netflix. Just read an interview with a Coen brother (forget which) where he seemed to indicate that the normal channels for the kinds of big bucks he and his brother need to make their particular magic happen... were drying up. So he pointed out the nouveaux riches of the Internet media companies as the new go-to sources... which rather blew my mind!And then... I see The Christmas Chronicles!

Yes I wish it could've been two hours longer, but there are lots of things to like.The atmosphere, the production values that suited the imaginative moments really well, the visual effects, the music, and the humor. Also, the entire cast did a fine job.The actors who played Kate and Teddy Pierce, the two children protagonists of the film, weren't that bad, but Kurt Russell made this film for me. He managed to bring energy, humor, and mythos to his role as Santa Claus and becomes the very heart of the film.I understand the mixed reviews the film just got, but I'm totally recommending this to others who love Santa Claus! Yes it's far from being a masterpiece but as far as modern holiday films go, this is one of the best!",The Christmas Chronicles
46,kjproulx,A Harmless Holiday Flick,7,5 December 2018,"Films that rely on the premise of the movie revolving around Christmas are always a perfect viewing experience during the holidays. It's very rare that viewers feel the absolute need to watch a holiday film during fall, spring or summer, so when these movies finally arrive/air, it's worth the wait. I feel a certain leniency when talking about Christmas movies, due to the fact that I just enjoy watching them in general. That being said, I will be putting my personal bias aside in favour of giving an authentic review here, which is going to be quite positive regardless. One of Netflix's latest feature film releases in The Christmas Chronicles may just be one of the best Christmas movies in recent memory, but that's because there really haven't been many great ones in the last decade or so. Here's why I believe The Christmas Chronicles deserve your attention this holiday season.Still grieving the loss of their father and having to stay home alone on Christmas Eve, two siblings discover the real Santa as he enters their house, which sets them on a journey with him to save Christmas. Yes, this plot is very formulaic and has been done a million times in throughout the years, but these are all very like-able characters. Teddy (the older brother) begins as a troubled teen, but has a great arc throughout the movie, especially between him and his sister's relationship and Kate (his younger sister) is reinvigorated with her belief in Santa. This film explores many facets of the Christmas season and what it means, while also presenting a fun adventure for the whole family. On top of that, Kurt Russell makes for a fantastic Santa Claus.Aside from appearing in tentpole films like The Fate of the Furious or Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, it's been a while since he's truly headlined a mainstream film. While Netflix isn't exactly mainstream in terms of theatricality, I would classify this as his biggest lead role in quite a while. Not only is it nice to see him at the forefront, but he truly does play a great Santa. His enthusiasm is terrific and the way he plays off the kids as if he's almost tired of being Santa or just too good at it in general, his performance makes this film worth watching alone. The subtle adult humour makes this movie an easy watch for adults, but there's also a lot to go around for kids.From computer-generated elves to Santa's sleigh flying through the sky with computer-generated reindeer, this has everything that kids hope to see in a film like this. Not that I'm saying it's as good of a film as the original Tim Allen-lead The Santa Clause, but this is the first movie since then that had such a broad spectrum of comedy. From lame poop and fart jokes for kids to humour that only adults will understand, The Christmas Chronicles truly has it all. As I said though, you've seen this movie a million times, but if that doesn't bother you, I think you'll thoroughly enjoy this film as I did.In the end, The Christmas Chronicles was a very nice surprise from Netflix and I hope more holiday films like this can be made in the foreseeable future. Aside from R-rated sequels to comedies like Bad Santa 2, A Bad Moms Christmas, or even A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas, original Christmas movies have been lacking over the last few years. Although not perfect, this was a breath of fresh air and I can absolutely see myself revisiting this one in the Decembers to come.",The Christmas Chronicles

With a video camera and sneaky traps all set, things are soon in motion which could ruin Christmas in 2018 completely. It's now up to Kate and Teddy to team up with Santa Claus himself (played by Kurt Russell), to together try and save Christmas all in one night. If they fail, Christmas spirit will be at an all time low which will lead to an increase of hate, crime and other terrible activities across the world.Growing up as a kid I used to love watching a great family Christmas film. In fact, I got to see Home Alone 1 in cinemas and to this day it remains a Christmas classic in the eyes of Finesse Movie Reviews. Since then, other than a small handful of good Christmas films (Elf and The Santa Clause to name a few) most modern Christmas films released each year are generally forgettable (Deck The Halls, Christmas With The Kranks- dare I go on?).Thankfully, I'm happy to report that The Christmas Chronicles is a memorable family Christmas film for 2018. And the best part is, it's gone straight to Netflix when I feel it could have been rather successful if it went into local cinemas.I personally loved the film's plot and overall tone. The film also has lots of creativity in regards to Santa, The North Pole, Santa's Presents and the list goes on. Have you ever wondered how Santa visits every home in one night? Well, this film has fun and tries to answers all your wondering questions. And to be honest, I found myself laughing and generally impressed with what the film brought as a Christmas film. And let's not forget the best part of this film... Kurt Russell as Santa Claus is brilliant. When I first heard the classic action star would be wearing the red suit I couldn't really picture it in my mind. After watching this film, he truly is one of the greatest Santa Claus I've seen on screen and it's rather obvious that Kurt Russell had some fun during production too.Overall, I found this Christmas film to be a pleasant surprise. It's well done, funny and rather creative as it tries to answers all the questions you could ever think about when it comes to Santa. I personally feel this film is great to watch as a family as it contains light hearted comedy and a postive message for all. Even though it's a kids film, remember folks... age is just a number and it never hurts to stop being a Grinch and watch a family film during this holiday season.7.1/10

60,RogerMooreTheBestBond,Kurt Russell more than delivers as Santa Claus!,10,2 January 2020,"I always worry about watching new Christmas films or anything new that Hollywood puts out. I am an avid watcher of old films. Old Hollywood is what I like. The new films put out are vulgar, political or just plain offensive. I am very happy to say that The Christmas Chronicles is a great film. It started out badly. I thought to myself Oh no! The little girl starts a video out to Santa and says she curses when her brother upsets her. She does say one curse word, but thankfully that was it. The dad also had passed away. That was sad, but was part of the story. The older brother had lost his way and started to do some bad things. However, once the kids got to meet Santa, it was fun ride after that. I must say Kurt Russell may have put on the finest Santa Claus performance of all time. I still love Edmund Gwenn in Miracle on 34th Street. He was so good in that film. You felt he was Santa Claus. Kurt Russell does the same and with some great humor added along the way. I just loved the way he would approach everyone and tell them what they got for gifts as a kid or what they were wanting as a gift for Christmas. It always made people go, who is this guy and how does he know this about me. Anyway, this films shines because of Kurt Russell and the 2 kids that help him along the way. I also enjoyed the CGI Elves and I usually hate CGI in films. I was so happy to see they are filming a sequel for 2020. Can't wait!",The Christmas Chronicles
61,pinkarray,"Yet another predictable, sappy Christmas film",4,29 November 2018,"I don't know why the audience is hyping this movie up. Maybe it's me not being a fan of these Christmas movies but this film isn't much different from your average Christmas film. It has the grief of dealing with the loss of a parent, teenager going out to do bad things, siblings fighting so there's the drama, a little bit of comedy, and a saccharine finale. It just seemed more like something hallmark would make than netflix.The way they introduced the plot was contrived. It's about these these two kids who catch a glimpse of Santa (how did he end up in there) while watching a past home video and they set up decorations and eat ice cream, eager to see Santa while their mom is out working an overnight shift. Then, it leads to this cool action scene on the sleigh and it ends up crashing and they lose the bag of presents, so Santa can't bring anymore presents.The characters are contrived, I mean, who sprinkles white stuff in front of a fireplace? Why aren't people getting surprised when they see Santa Claus, I would expect people to get all amazed and say ""Oh my gosh, is that Santa?"" and why are buildings like jobs and stores even open on Christmas? It's like that scene where the little girl is begging her mom not to go to work, I think the point of that scene was to create more drama with the relationships of the characters and their conflict, as if it didn't already have enough drama with two siblings who can't get along because this bubbly sister wants to spend time with her older brother who is more interested in doing crazy teen stuff with friends. The acting was eh... mediocre, okay, I guess, it wasn't that great. The kids came off as irritating with their pushy attitudes. The elves were cutesy but also annoying cowards and Santa does naughty things that I don't think he would've done and provided the more saccharine parts of the film.The ending turned out to be saccharine, how does Kate know how to speak elvish at that point? What's the point of the forced scene where the cop's ex-wife calls him out to coffee other than Santa just somehow used his magic to get Lisa to reunite with the cop? And then, there's the cliched scene where the boy who really wants to see his dad again actually sees his dad replace the boy's image in an ornament and the dad actually speaks to him. So, we have the cliched scene where a grieving character meets the apparition of their loved one.The CGI was...a bit heavy-handed, I guess. The elves were cute but it was hard to tell if they were actually animated or just had more realistic CGI. I didn't really think it was necessary to make the reindeer CGI since they could've just got real reindeer to play the part.The only interesting twist that they created in this bland film was that it turns out that Santa doesn't say ""Ho, ho, ho"", I thought it was slightly interesting that it turned out to be all a myth in this film but that myth is debunked at the end of the film.It sends out a bad message that it's okay to be naughty. I mean, flaws aren't necessarily a good thing to have, it's just part of being human.If you are looking for a creative, good-natured holiday film, this is not the one you're looking for. It has a few good action scenes in it, a few funny moments with Santa, and a touchingly heartfelt scene between the siblings at the church but the film ends up getting bogged down with childish appeal and you're left with an iffy Christmas fest.",The Christmas Chronicles

Very impressed with what this movie has accomplished. Being a Christmas movie, it did what it was made to do. It had more than Christmas spirit though, like amazing humor and an awesome car chase! It's fun for the whole family, but I seemed to enjoy it more than my 8-year-old did.
Siblings Kate (Darby Camp) and Teddy Pierce (Judah Lewis) hatch a scheme to capture Santa Claus (Kurt Russell) on Christmas Eve. When the plan goes awry, the kids join forces with a somewhat jolly Saint Nick and his loyal elves to save the holiday before it is too late.
I was very skeptical going into this movie with Kurt Russell being Santa Claus, but he brought a lot of heart and humor to the character. He didn't over play the jolliness and just kept it fun. The kids I thought also did a good job in the movie and kept you engage with the story.
What I appreciate most about this movie is the fresher modern take it took on the real world and the north pole story we saw a lot of in 80's and 90's Christmas movies. Kids are not entirely what kids in the 90's or 80's were like. Even the girl is presented as having a potty mouth and curses here and there which I think is realistic for a kid her age. The brother is dealing with some post-trauma rebellion, and some serious stuff, not just inexplicable anger.
I really like how they approached the magic behind how Santa operates. It reminded me a little of Doctor Who and the space-time vortex the doctor travels through. I'm almost certain the show inspired that part of this movie. They simply made him even more magical and made him speedy. In most movies you see him taking his sweet time squeezing through chimneys and waddling around people's living rooms. The CGI wasn't the best, especially with the Elves even though they were cute little guys and the dialogue in this movie at times feel weak and forced. Mostly with the conversations between the brother and sister, and they didn't have the best chemistry on screen. But, the star of this movie was Kurt Russell as Santa, he was perfect for this modern role and it felt really authentic.
Overall, this movie was pretty good. As a Christmas movie and a movie in general I really enjoyed it. This might be one I watch every year if I need to be put in the Christmas spirit!

64,Mivas_Greece,"A different, much cooler view of Santa by the amazing Kurt Russell. Lots of fun for all ages!",8,27 December 2020,"Christmas movie. The well-known actor Kurt Russell, from tough, military etc in other films (one of the old ones I remember when I first saw him in 1994's Star Gate), here in a completely different role, but he plays extremely well and seems to enjoy it himself too!Christmas Chronicles is a comedy family movie - I would say a parody - where Santa becomes a jazz player, drifts in the style of an experienced rally player and much more! A very enjoyable movie with plenty of humor for young and older ages! The scene with the elf who took the electric saw for the bad guys and did not leave it, was a lot of fun! It has interest and action throughout its duration and does not become boring for a single moment. The movie's song with the jazzist Santa is the best moment of the movie, and a very cool song for Christmas! Still, the humor is a bit of a parody style, so maybe some very young ages with a specific image of Santa will be disappointed, but I think they will like it in all other cases.I recommend it to everyone, enjoyable by all ages!7-7.5/10 from me.",The Christmas Chronicles
65,MickeyTheConstant,Best Christmas Movie In Ages,8,26 December 2018,"Before watching this movie, I had no real expectations. I had not really seen a recent Christmas movie that had impressed me. Yes, some have been watchable and fun but not what I would call a Christmas classic, you know the ones that get repeated in years to come and you still find yourself tuning in and watching again. I was though, very much, pleasantly surprised. The first ten minutes or so does have the feel of a made for TV movie. It starts with the backstory, a couple of kids, slightly annoying at times if honest, not the ones you instantly root for, but that all changes when the main man shows up! Kurt Russel is the best Santa I have seen in ages. He is fun, charismatic, he is at times nearing towards Bad Santa territory. My wife actually referred to him as 'Hot Santa'. Yep, Kurt still has it I guess. There is a fun musical number, cool Reindeer and cute Elves. What more could you want? Santa teams up with the kids to save Christmas and get themselves into a number of scrapes but along the way spread Christmas cheer to many a folk and even towards the end you find yourselves rooting for the kids that 90 minutes before you were rolling your eyes at. The ending is also fun and a nice touch and you can't help but smile and really get into the Christmas spirit. It's a movie for adults, kids and families and I genuinely think will get a cult following and be watched for many years to come.",The Christmas Chronicles
66,snowfre,A good Christmas story with misfit camp humor,6,6 December 2019,"""The Christmas Chronicles"" initially comes across as an essential holiday film. Starting with a montage of wholesome, unbelievably perfect Christmases at the Pierces, we flash forward to present day. The father has passed and for the upcoming holiday season, the spirit of Christmas is as gone as a fitness session at Santa's Workshop. When the two kids, Teddy (Lewis) and Kate (Camp) is left alone on Christmas Eve as their mother (Williams-Paisley) needs to work. Convincing her brother to try and film Santa Claus himself as he comes down the chimney, Kate and Teddy encounters the man and after a few problems along the way, they need to save Christmas. Throughout ""The Christmas Chronicles"", Netflix delivers us some nice, warm holiday feels, despite lackluster CGI; however, at times the film takes turns into what seems like parody, when the comedy enter some ironic camp grounds. Kurt Russel, playing the man of Yule, is doing it well and has good comedic timing. The jokes are quite fun, and Russel really carries a lot of the film's humor himself, so far so good. The issue is that Netflix's target audience is hard to find. What are they looking for? It's to ironic for kids, to Christmasy for teens, to childish for adults. Neither is it really a family film as there is not much humor to unite around. Is ""The Christmas Chronicle"" worth watching? Yes. If not for anything else, due to Kurt Russel's wonderful performance.",The Christmas Chronicles
67,AdrienneGrayceMusic,Nice modernized version of Santa,10,27 December 2018,"The movie is quite different than the other Santa movies out there. Nice edition for Netflix with this one. kurt Russell literally is Santa Claus in this film. A modernized version. Great storyline. It showed the grief that people experience with their lost loved ones during christmas, and did a great job of portraying the real emotions. The little elf characters were a cute little edition. I think this movie with me another christmas tradition in our house for years to come",The Christmas Chronicles
68,MovieBuff11732,Best New Christmas Movie This Year,8,8 December 2018,The Christmas Chronicles is about kids who want to see Santa but they get to into it and ruin Christmas. They all try to fix it before it is too late.The Christmas Chronicles is a fun Christmas movie. It was pretty fun to watch. Kurt Russell seemed like he was having a fun time being Santa. He did a great job. This movie wasn't trying to win any awards. It was just fun to watch. It was a little on the darker side for a Christmas movie though.The Christmas Chronicles is a great movie and I wound record watching it.,The Christmas Chronicles
69,brandonneicke,A true Christmas movie,10,9 December 2020,"Honestly I'm not a huge Christmas movie guy. I love cinema and I love Christmas but Christmas movies are usually redundant and quite frankly non sense. This movie is original and true to the Christmas spirit. Well written, very well acted and even down to quality directing. That's cinema. You don't have many Christmas movies in cinema even though you have thousands of Christmas movies. I don't want to spoil so I won't say much but I love this movie.",The Christmas Chronicles
70,hjalsayegh,"They tried something, Not sure if it worked but Kurt Russell is in it.",7,29 November 2018,"The movie tried a new spin on the Santa myth. Some of the ideas were interesting like the Christmas themed wormhole and how Santa's magic worked. However bring logic into it created other holes in the tale as they insisted on following old tropes as well.
In the end however Kurt Russell was the kickass Santa and he carried this thing like a beast! Worth a watch at least once.",The Christmas Chronicles
71,Jessicanu94,Cute,6,3 December 2018,Not amazing but not bad and I liked the jail singing scene,The Christmas Chronicles
72,chloegalley,A really good uplifting movie !!,7,5 December 2020,The Christmas chronicles is a 2018 American Christmas comedy film starring Kurt Russell as Santa Claus. A lovely light hearted film to watch and I really enjoyed it. Great acting with a good storyline. All I can is watch it on Netflix you won't be disappointed. A good movie to watch on a weekend in front of the fire with snacks. The Children will love it a magical Christmas film. Definitely worth the watch,The Christmas Chronicles
73,svhot,"""Christmas Chronicles"" is an excellent Christmas movie",10,26 December 2018,"""The Christmas Chronicles"" is such a wonderful and sweet Christmas movie. The greatest highlight of this movie is the fact that veteran actor Kurt Russell is playing the role of Santa Claus. I believe Mr Russell is the best Santa ever.The movie features a family that comprises of a working mother, a teenage son, and a young daughter. The father, it seems, died a few months ago. The mother is called to work on Christmas eve, and tells her not-very-much law abiding teenage son to take care of his young sister. The young girl is quite an intelligent one, and she has made a ""brilliant"" plan for the night. She convinces her brother to help her in making a video recording of Santa Claus, in return for a video recording of a car being stolen by her brother and his friends.They set up the camera and other stuff, and wait patiently for Santa. When Santa Claus arrives, they run with the camera behind him. As they follow him outside the house, the little girl spots Santa's ride in mid-air, together with the reindeer. The girl jumps in Santa's ride, and her brother has no option but to follow her and jumps in also. As Santa continues his ride to deliver the remaining presents, the little girl puts her hand on his shoulders and calls out ""Santa"", which startles him. This causes Santa to lose control of his ride, in addition to this loss, he also loses his bag of remaining presents, and the reindeer too.Now, the brother and sister will need to help Santa locate and deliver the presents, otherwise they will be put on the ""naughty list"" for life. Thus begins a night of an epic journey ; an adventurous night with Santa, his elves, his reindeer, cops, robbers, and a few characters in between. The director has made a really nice, feel-good Christmas movie that will appeal to everyone.",The Christmas Chronicles
74,mbhgkmsgg,Kurt as Santa is enough to make me happy,6,27 November 2020,"Another cheesy, but fun and heartfelt Christmas movie from Netflix. The Christmas Chronicles is as over the top and cheesy as you'd expect. However, it did make me smile and put me in a great mood. That's all it needed to do, and it delivered.This movie offers absolutely nothing new to this genre. But as they say, why fix it if it ain't broke. There is exactly one goal that films like this have. It's to put you in the holiday mood and make you happy. If the movie manages to do so, I really have nothing to complain about. And this movie manages to do so. At its core, it's a fun adventure with sprinkles of self-discovery. It has a good message, and it's heartwarming throughout. I found it very easy to forget about everything else, and let the movie take me for a ride. It's was fun enough to keep me interested, and it was surprisingly action-packed. I guess that that's what you can expect with Kurt Russel in the lead.Speaking of Kurt Russel, having him as Santa was a stroke of genius. He is just as awesome as Santa as he is in any of his other roles. At times I felt like I was watching Escape From Chicago: The Revenge of Santa. Russel really ends up being the driving force in this film, providing a more serious side as well as the comedy. I mean, there is a Christmas Jail House Rock scene with the Blues Brother glasses, Elvis dance moves, and everything else that you'd want from it.I feel like it's rather pointless to write about films like The Christmas Chronilces. These are the types of movie that are most likely to be in the background after the Christmas dinner or as a fun family activity. The majority of people who watch this could care less about what I or anyone else has to say about it. Like I said, as long as it's fun, heartwarming, Christmasy and just the right amount of cheesy, it's doing its job. And this movie checks all those marks.The one realization I have made while watching these corny Christmas movies is that I like them more than I would've ever thought, or that I'd like to admit. There's something so nice about them. Being able to sit down for an hour or two, and stop worrying about everything else is just wonderful. It's something that I'd recommend for everyone, at least once in a while.",The Christmas Chronicles
75,elmoslively,This movie belongs to Kurt Russell !,9,9 December 2018,"Kurt Russell plays one of the best Santa's I've seen in a long time. This is a great movie thanks to a script full of humour and just the right amount of edginess. It's well directed with some great set pieces and some dazzling visual effects and a few surprises. One of the best Christmas movies since ""Elf"" with a great supporting cast and just an overall feeling of Christmas cheer. This one is destined to become a classic !9",The Christmas Chronicles
76,punisherversion1,Santa with charm and swagger,8,5 December 2018,"The Christmas Chronicles:
Directed by Clay Kaytis and written by David Guggenheim and Matt LiebermanChristmas time is here. Gather round everyone as we put on a new Christmas movie that might just join the pantheon of Christmas movies that are watched with a regular rotation. For me that is Arthur Christmas, It's a Wonderful Life and Santa Claus the movie. Does this one join?Yes and no. The main attraction was a swaggering cowboy like Kurt Russell as Santa Claus. Is there nothing this man can't do? He manages to take the character of Santa Claus and bring something new. We've never had a Santa this full of confidence. He knows everything and can seemingly do no wrong. Kurt Russell makes it work.The other actors acquit themselves admirably. I actually didn't hate the kids which is something I normally hate. Child actors man especially when they're desperately pushing the precocious angle is really grating. I find my own children adorable, not the ones on TV. I admire the emotion they tried to add with the Dad being gone and this spurning on the reckless behavior. It didn't necessarily connect with me emotionally but I was appreciative of the effort.This brings me to the sleigh and the cartoon nightmare elves. The sleigh goes into a wormhole to hop between towns at light speed it seems. We don't see it much because of course we need a reason to make things difficult for our intrepid children and stranded Santa. The elves are multi talented, cute little cartoons but also act like they'll strip the flesh from your bones. Santa is holding things at bay because with these bad boys laying around, working in the North Pole things could get out of control in a great big hurry.I would recommend this movie as just a good time. It's not a complicated movie and it doesn't need to be. Kurt Russell makes it the lovely ride it is. I give this movie a B.",The Christmas Chronicles

78,nafodude,Excellent Xmas eve film,8,1 January 2019,"My 10 year old son is starting to doubt the Santa magic and this film certainly helped him quash the disbelief.It's comical, crazy and certainly gets you in the Xmas spirit.",The Christmas Chronicles
79,mmuggi,Hallmark?? What Hallmark?,7,4 December 2020,"Here is a movie that is not near a Hallmark product. It's a really nice performance by Kurt Russel, who could have chosen to just snoop his way through the film and laugh all the way to the bank. Instead, he gives the full throttle as Santa Claus. A Santa Claus that I have rarely seen before. He has heart and soul in it, and understands how to convey a humor that a DILF Santa Claus has.The film is directed by Clay Kaytis, and this is his directorial debut in a not 100% animated film. He is quite solid in the role of director, and you can see that he is used to directing animation.It's screenwriter / story writer Matt Lieberman's first film in 10 years after Dr. Doolittle. An honorable effort for him too.For the action scenes, they have action writer Eric Guggenheim.So it's a solid team that Netflix, Madhouse and 1942 Pictures have scraped together.However, it is not a whole perfect movie. It's a little thin in terms of keeping its own rules - if Santa's not handing out presents to everyone on the naughty list - will there be a war? And does it only apply to children, not adults? And how can parents not ask questions about why there is at least one extra gift under the tree ???? These are things you probably should not think about, but I can not completely let go.",The Christmas Chronicles
80,darius_sutherland,A New Santas In Town,8,14 December 2019,There's been a need for a Santa movie and this fills the gap. Good family fun. Kurt Russell is great. Kids will love it. I'd like to see a new and improved Xmas movie every year.,The Christmas Chronicles
81,jk-692-236394,A fun and joyful Christmas ride!,9,27 November 2018,"I have been a fan of Kurt Russell since I was a kid and he was in Disney movies.
He played a modern version of Santa perfectly in this movie. I found many of the ideas they showed very clever in this movie. Showing the way he got around the world so fast and got into everyone's homes. The whole Santa bag ""world"" was very clever and captivating. The two kids were great too. Especially the young lady, she really pulled off her role well. She was believable and spunky. I actually liked the elves, after you get over the Furby vibe of them. They were quite effective and interesting. I felt like the writers found smart ways to answer some of the questions little ones have when they are under the magic time of believing in Santa.
I was worried they went over the line when they had cop chases and jail, but Santa turning that into a Christmas concert was pretty effective.
This movie is certainly going to go on our Christmas watch list, and I am sure it will be on many other homes as well.",The Christmas Chronicles

My first thought was Netflix must be making buckets of money, because they sure are doing lots of original programming. If nothing else, ""The Christmas Chronicles"" is the hippest & coolest and most modern Christmas movie production I've seen this year.The storyline won't surprise you, so just enjoy the effects, cameos, Kurt Russell, & the rebirth of the Gremlins. If you're a true cynic it's easy to wonder about all the product placement here, but in the end, so what? Chicago is beautiful by night. Big Trouble in Little China? Even the naughty gang members are polite & diverse, I think it's designed to make it all family watchable. The jail number is great, and obviously a happy ending.

104,anoceanroars,Another Netflix Film Failure,4,22 November 2018,"Netflix is great at producing series, but fail miserably at films, especially Christmas films.The Christmas Chronicles are not really chronicles since it is one story about two kids who lost a father and their mother is working Christmas Eve. They attempt to catch Santa in the act, but end up going on an adventure with Santa. A boring adventure.The problem is that the kids, especially the young girl played by Darby Camp, are not charismatic enough to carry a film. Camp plays Kate like an adult rather than a ten year old child. As for Judah Lewis, he could improve by being a bit more mature for his age. I do not know any teenager boy who will let his much younger sister boss him around. Unrealistic. Yes, it is a fantasy film, but it needs to be grounded in reality to work.Other things that fail in this film is the plot, the dialogue and the CGI.
The two things that work are Santa or rather Kurt Russell as Saint Nick and the elves. If only the story could have risen to his level of believability. Chris Columbus who has made some great film has lost his touch or he did it for the money.Two spoiler alerts: There are some angry little elves in this film. Too bad Buddy was not around to say so. And the family connection not fully realised until the end when Mrs. Claus appears. Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell and Oliver Hudson are family.4/10 Mostly for Kurt Russell, the family affair and the elves.",The Christmas Chronicles

Kurt Russell delivers as Santa Claus in all of his acting career, the story is really good, the characters are remarkable despite Teddy Pierce as a teenager with a serious attitude (played by Judah Lewis) definitely reminded me of Cody from Barney's Great Adventure (1998), the special effects and even the Elves made with CGI are awesome since they are not like something Industrial Light and Magic would work on and yet this is a great family movie to watch every year around Christmas time and an great important lesson on how to believe to yourself.

Chris Columbus did a great job producing this film! It definitely reminded me of Christmas movies he had worked on in the past like home alone and Christmas with the Kranks. This movie was very childlike and magical. I will say some of the parts of the movie were a bit scary and some were eye roll inducing but other than it's a great film. Kurt Russell does a great job playing Santa and I think the only person who might've played this type of Santa better would be Tim Allen, though they were virtually the same. I think maybe Tim would've liked to play Santa like this if Disney hadn't given him so many limitations...but what do I know? The kids and elves were so cute. As a fellow New Englander I was Happy to see a small Mill town like Lowell, MA represented. I was honestly surprised in both and good and disappointing way that they didn't revive the dad at the end but that would probably be pushing it too far. All and all this is a wonderful Christmas film that will definitely become a Christmas classic as it's like elf, home alone and the Santa clause in one film.",The Christmas Chronicles

They shall all get their lumps of coal. Hate it for them. Ho ho ho!🎅🏻🤶🏻Merry Christmas🎄🎁",The Christmas Chronicles
112,mikegibb-60418,Delightful new take on a very familiar genre,8,19 December 2019,"A highly amusing and yet poignant new kid on the Christmas block. A fun story with a terrific new twist on Santa courtesy of an engaging Kurt Russell. It looks spectacular and despite being fairly long for a Christmas movie it never drags. Some great laugh out loud moments especially the music scene in the jail and the elfick sub titles. And while the story line, with its air of tragedy, will appeal to all ages small kids will love the elfs. Funny, warm and surprisingly moving, this is the best new Christmas movie for many a 25th of December.",The Christmas Chronicles

After watching this movie, all other Santa Clauses will seem boring, fat, out of touch, and stupid.(except for the Baldwin version in the Guardians, another classic). Hurrah for Kurt Russell!!!

I think that kids should be somewhere between 8 and 10, depending on their maturity level, to watch this movie.
That said, It's a fun ride for the family. It's interesting and funny for all ages.
Many people listed this movie as a 10, meaning that they think it is the best movie ever made in the history of movies.<<<<They are either lying, have an agenda, or absolutely No Clue, probably, about anything else in life, BUT:
Don't let their nonsense dissuade you from watching this movie because IT IS a good movie.

116,pirlo2004,All the classics in one movie. Just Wow!,9,2 December 2018,"I don't really know where to start! As a fan of all things Christmas, not expecting much from this and worried that the old school, nostalgia feel will never be recreated, I thought this would fall flat and didn't think I could see past Kurt Russel as Santa... boy was I wrong... I have just watched this with my 6 year old and we were gripped from start to finish. The visuals are stunning, the representation of Santa is as close to perfect as you'll see, it answers so many of the make believe questions you have. It has humour, action, story and pure Christmas magic all the way through. It feels like Miracle on 34th, Santa Claus the movie, Elf, The Santa Claus and Home Alone all rolled in to one. A truley epic masterpiece and an absolute dead cert to become a classic. Just wow!",The Christmas Chronicles

119,martinjkristiansen,A great and funny family movie,9,1 December 2018,Kurt Russel does it again! Warm and lovely Christmas movie! Thanks to Netflix and merry Christmas to IMDB,The Christmas Chronicles
120,breemoria,Kurt Russell shone as Santa,7,22 November 2018,Parts of the show were unappealing but Kurt's portrayal of Santa elevated it above the norm. Special effects were great. Look forward to this becoming a regular Christmas repeat.,The Christmas Chronicles
121,natsuka_arei,Love the Kurt Russell as Santa! Can't understand why some people don't like this one,9,20 December 2018,"PRO:
1.) Kurt as the Santa Claus really brings fresh perspective, being the modern Santa he was! Also, I love the design of his clothes, still looks like Santa but in a more modern and fashionable way. He loves cookies and milk but might be not the old Santa we know: fat, always says Ho ho ho. He shows human characteristic but with a magic touch here and there. In short, he is still a magical creature but feels closer to us, an average human being. Last but not least, I love the way he was constantly trying to prove himself to the adults that he is the real Santa Claus :) esp. the police scene2.) Nice music. A bunch of classic ones with different arrangement.3.) Nice CGI and effect. Nice design for elves and those elf languages. Haha.4.) Movie with light story so don't expect it to be something deep. Please do bear in mind, this is supposed to be a magical story so don't try to put everything in box you called logic5.) The ending! I have to admit I am satisfied with the ending. So after save the Christmas, Kate & Teddy get back to their home. Teddy wrote letter to Santa about his wish to meet his father again. In the end, Santa can't bring the dead back alive (thanks, God. I don't need an overdone magic story. It is a very realistic ending yet still feels the magic of Christmas, it is all I need). Santa ended up give Teddy an old Christmas ball decoration. Teddy then, saw the refection of his dad in the ball and in himself. I think it kinds of sweet, it is like reminding us the loved ones might be dead already but never really leave us.CONS:
1.) The plot is pretty much predictable. At first I wish for something more for the plot because they end up give us the modern Santa played by Kurt yet the whole story is the classic old one when the main characters try to save Christmas. Let's just be honest. How many Christmas movies out there retold the same stories about Santa trying to save the Christmas by sending the present before the time is up :( so many, lost counts, and I don't really interest with that kinds of main story2.) The chainsaw scene! I think this movie was intended both for adult and kids so I can understand if there's any pop culture reference or adult like joke but the chainsaw scene, even for me is too much. I was surprised when they show an elf intended to use chainsaw to chop the teenage boy3.) Not so much on the messages. Usually Christmas movies are all about family and the spirit of Christmas to believe things even if you are growing up into an adult. Yet, this movies lack of both. Sure, it is about the struggle of the Pierce family (esp. Kate & Teddy) because of the death of the father, but that's it. Nothing more. This movie was entertaining, but I can't get a deep impression on it. Nothing inspirational, sure several scenes supposed to be emotional moments but nothing really deep or touching enough for me.Overall, it is still worth to watch. Another light movie for your holiday. Just don't expect too much, though it is still a good one.",The Christmas Chronicles

124,star_hazard,A feel good Christmas movie. Also Kurt Russell,7,23 November 2018,Kurt Russell as Santa is the main highlight of this film.Good movie for Christmas. The plot is simple nothing deep so don't expect any plot twists or such. The dialogue is fine a bit cheesy in some parts but it's for Christmas so it's a pass. There are plenty of movie/modern references which is fun. The ending is a nice touch.The cringe.. well the CGI could be better.Hit or miss.. the girl here is more mature than her brother. The brother is more like her underling.Overall.. as I said it's a good movie if you just watch it with no deep expectations. There's not much drama or in-depth character development. But it is full of Christmas feel.,The Christmas Chronicles

The Main Character kids are perfect for their roles and as the movie progress you'll see the emotional development of the characters and their dealings with their family situation as well as belief in Santa Claus.This movie had me both laughing and crying while giving me a constant good feeling.

132,samnlm,Kurt Russell is the Greatest Santa Claus...,10,26 November 2018,...ever portrayed in a movie. His acting has always been top notch. Good seeing Mrs. Santa Claus (Goldie Hawn) in the movie too! Kurt has one of the best singing and dancing acts on the silver screen; he's a one-man show. I grew up watching him on Disney and that one episode on Gilligan's Island. He's just a cool actor. The best. Great! Remarkable!!,The Christmas Chronicles

What makes it fun is Kurt Russell. I can't imagine anyone else playing this role.. he's the best Santa ever! When Russell isn't channeling St. Nick, he's channeling Elvis. He's just ... perfect!And if the movie wasn't delightful enough, that surprise nugget at the end was an unexpected bonus!",The Christmas Chronicles
135,Man-Behind-The-Pen,Bland and boring,1,24 November 2018,"Netflix it seems wanted to get on board with Christmas movie, because everyone else is making them.The thing is, most of these movies are diabetes inducing, very poorly written, cliche infused peaces of garbage with predictable plots and anything but funny.This one is one of those movies.Script is weak.
Plot is boring as f. . . . ck.
Acting, is bland.
The director didn't know what direction to take the movie either. IT was just a colossal waste of time.I can only assume that all the positive reviews here were paid for and are far from reality. Avoid this movie if you value good cinematography.",The Christmas Chronicles
136,aranormer,Okay,6,22 November 2018,"Not exceptional, not bad. Okay.Watched this purely because Kurt Russell. This was a nice attempt to re-create some of the older ""Santa meets kids and things happen"" -movies. Writer had made an honest effort to try and create something original in regards of the logistics of Santa's operation. Special effects were suitably dulled and subtle, enhancing the story rather than surpassing it. Acting was okay. A bit wooden at times with all involved, but that's to be expected in a movie like this.Now, I do like Kurt in most of the movies I have seen him, but... Oh, I wish he'd stop accepting roles which put him in old west. He's no cowboy no matter how how hard he poses as one. That makes him look and sound irritatingly pompous, and from time to time that act bled through in his portrayal of Santa as well. He should have left that pretended macho-attitude back to where it belongs, to the set of Death Proof. He doesn't need to pretend macho.",The Christmas Chronicles

140,sugarnspices,"It's Christmas time, pretty baby!",9,1 December 2018,"Omg what a FUN Christmas movie!! I will say I am a 32 year old woman, and watched this while I was pretty tired and had a bit too much spiked egg nog last night (if you know what I'm saying) and I STILL loved it!Everything about this movie works and works so well together. I loved the kids, the little girl was so endearing and the brother did a great job perfectly portraying a boredline lost teen grieving his fathers death, but still a good boy at heart. Also loved watching their relationship change and them bond again as the movie and their story progressed. Really felt the love and family between the two characters.I loved how they portrayed how Santa got around, from the way he goes down chimneys, to his adorable reindeer, to how his toy bag works and especially the North Pole/Santa Headquarters inside! Had a classic, old, homey feel and what it would look like in ""real life"". I really loved the little elves too, nice to see a change from either little people or children playing them and they were SO cute (loved their little Norwegian style language, too.)My FAV part of this movie was the remake of the jailhouse Christmas's blues song! So fun! I could see that playing live at a bar around Christmas time and everyone having a blast! I didn't even realize that was Kurt Russell's actual voice. He killed it.Speaking of, Kurt Russell was the PERFECT Santa! Handsome and cool, yet sweet and endearing. Loved his outfit and the color of his beard. He made Santa his own thing while still feeling the nostalgia of classic Santa.This movie had a very ""real"" feel to it, the settings, scenes and characters. Not too corney or cliche, it did have a couple scenes/moments, but that's not surprising it being a children friendly Christmas movie and all. I obviously have nothing but great things to say about this movie and it will now be a Christmas tradition every year!!Merry Christmas!",The Christmas Chronicles

145,zimmerblake,Copycat Christmas,4,4 December 2018,"The movie had good intentions but was way too simple. The amount of character's that Santa surprises with his knowledge of their life might go into the triple digits and that's not an exaggeration. The entire movie is three scenes but repeated for two hours. Mostly we see this: Santa meets a stranger, stranger assumes Santa is just a creep in a rented suit, stranger is surprised to hear Santa actually knows everything about them and this leads to the stranger becoming hostile or helpful. The second scene that is repeated to exhaustion is the two kid's will be happy then become depressed because they randomly remember their dad died years ago. The last scene that pops up over and over is Santa sees an overweight depiction of himself and becomes angry that everyone thinks he is fat. And that is the entire movie.",The Christmas Chronicles

149,bradencn,Poor Writing and Overall Boring,3,28 November 2018,"Listen, Kurt Russel is one of my favorite actors, and it was fun to see Lamorne Morris (New Girl), and Steven Van Zandt (The Sopranos) make an appearance. That's for sure. But, MAN, this writing was horrible. All I wanted the whole time was to turn off the movie and head over to ""The Santa Clause,"" a MUCH better written film, written for the same audience.The film was played to the typical stereotypes: rebellious teenage brother, sweet and determined little sister...rebellious brother turns full circle, everything better again at the end, little sister was right all along. Typical, right? Done right, this is a sweet story, when tried to hard, it kind of falls flat.The CGI made elves were not a big help, the elvish language was too much...we aren't in Lord of The Rings, here. They tried too hard to make this film believable, quite honestly. Just stick to the basics, you know? Let the teenage boy (Teddy) be rebellious, but stealing cars with friends, leaving little sister home alone on Christmas eve, I mean, it seemed quite out of character for the kid. You don't get that look and feel from him and it felt quite out of place, as did the scene where he fails in taking the camera away from his little sister once he's realized he was caught. Put me as a teenage kid against one of my little sisters? Yea, I'd have that tape in 2 seconds if I wanted to. All I'm saying is outside of the ""scene"" where he steals a car, etc. you don't get the feel that he's a bad kid in any way...he seems more of an effeminate kind of guy trying to find his place in the world, to be honest. Not a tough criminal.For the girl, Kate, well...come one, make her more like Charlie from the Santa Clause...frustrated for not being believed, still determined, but not a perfect angel. She wasn't exciting, you know? Despite being a fun and family film, you still want character development! Charlie grew in love toward others, at least, he learned that in life you didn't have to be cynical, everything about Santa was a huge ""wow"" moment for him, and for the audience. For Kate, everything was the same...everything was predictable. Even the things she discovered about Santa...you just weren't excited for her.If you want a cute film to play in the background, sure, it's fine. But it's not one you'll be turning back to Christmas after Christmas. I want films to be believing, even if they are playing a fantasy. Taking the easy roads in writing isn't exciting. The story wasn't rounded very well at all.",The Christmas Chronicles
150,sabngoy,Funny and good family movie!,10,23 December 2019,Loved it! Not to get an oscar but a funny and good Christmas movie that puts you in a good mood!,The Christmas Chronicles
151,aka-45316,This Film is One that I Can Assure You Will Really Rock the House,10,8 December 2018,"In this original film starring Kurt Russell as Santa Claus, siblings Kate (played by Darby Camp) and Teddy Pierce (played by Judah Lewis) hatch a scheme to capture Santa Claus on Christmas Eve and get him on video. When the plan goes awry however, the kids join forces with a somewhat jolly Saint Nick and his loyal elves to save the holiday before the Christmas spirit completely vanishes.Let me tell something to you guys: this film caught me by surprise!The story that the film had, which was written by Matt Lieberman and David Guggenheim, was something that's new, different, and top-of-the-line fresh! It does visit the concept of saving Christmas, but, it's all in a completely new and unexpecting way. It even visited the concepts of family and holiday spirit wonderfully, which is great because I don't think many films do that anymore.The direction by Clay Kaytis, as well as the involvements of producers Chris Columbus, Michael Barnathan,and Mark Radcliffe were also what I would like to credit for helping this film skyrocket. Each of these people lended such brilliant creativity, and they made excellent use of what must've been a very low budget. By the latter, I mean that they made sure everything looked great without the use of too much money.Additionally, the acting was great, and the characters were extremely fun to be around. The character development of Teddy Pierce was extremely well-done and engaging, and I love how he learned to believe in himself, his loved ones, and in Santa no matter what. The rekindling bond between him and Kate Pierce was fantastic as a plus, and I deeply admired the innocence and feistiness that Kate had.Kurt Russell was very much meant to play Santa Claus. If his and the filmmakers' goal was to give Santa a personality and characterization unlike any other Santa Claus before him, I'd say mission accomplished! Kurt Russell portrayed his character perfectly, and he gave off such a great sense of humor. And man, I don't think I ever knew he could sing, but he can!Now, if I have to point out some certain problems, it would be that it had some cuss words, which would kind of make it all but family-oriented. There isn't too much, luckily. Just some.In conclusion, ""The Christmas Chronicles"" is a film that is original, imaginative, funny, heartfelt, and completely different compared to Christmas films of recent years. I highly recommend it to all.",The Christmas Chronicles

When I mentioned her about this movie, she was excited to watch it with me. Oh boy, the entire movie we were both with wild mouth open expressions, smiles and excitement. Few times during the movie she said "" I love this Santa Clause"" ""I love this Santa suit the best yet, it's so vintage and realistic"".We both loved the movie and it felt so good to kick the holidays watching this amazing and fun movie in a decorated chimney room with my 16 yrs old.

Usually Christmas movies are very predictable but this one had me guessing at almost every turn. CG was great, sets were intriguing, interesting and beautiful. The acting was great too. Kurt Russel is now my favorite Santa.I wish, however, they'd left out the jail song number and rethought the look/personalities of the elves. The song wasted time and was boring and the elves were just freaky gremlin-like hyper puppies. I know they were supposed to each have their own personalities but their scenes moved so fast much of that was lost and they were just an annoying herd of hyper fur.Beyond those two points, this could have been my favorite Christmas movie of all time.

This actually was quite funny, bittersweet and ultimately, uplifting.Kurt Russell was made for this take on Santa. It does have cheesiness, yes, but it relishes in that fact. Is it predictable? Yes, but it's still engaging. In fact the brother and sister were the least annoying child actors I've seen in a film like this in a long time.Is it made on a budget? Yes. Are the visual effects perfect? No. But this all adds to it's charm.To conclude, if you feeling melancholy at this time of the year, watch this. It just might make you feel better.

If only all the other pieces of this wreck were as good, this film really could be the future classic it so desperately wants to be.2/10 - Morally deficient actions that defy the message of the film and are there solely to drive the sloppily written script.1/10 - Creepy Ewok/Yoda/Gremlin amalgamated ripoffs standing in as Santa's helper elves. May go down in film history as one of the greatest examples ever of pandering to the audience.10/10 - Santa winning over the police officer. Had the film charted this sort of vibe for its entirety, this really could be the future classic it so desperately wants to be.So 23/40, a nudge over 5/10.

Modern being the kids fathers dead and instead of being grumpy about it the eldest has turned to grand theft auto, but still writes letters to Santa. Interesting. Imagine if one of the kids from jumangi was burning things instead of telling lies and you get the picture.If you look past this and the first fifteen minutes that makes Schindler's list look like the sound of music it's actually ok.Kurt Russel excels as Santa. He's got the personality and owns every second he's on the screen. Remembering everyone's name etc. The little girl is pretty good too. Not that annoying. It's the brother who is the weak link. He's a bad boy who just needs Santa to set him straight. If only OJ had the same visit at 16.The film tries to put too much modern stuff in it though. Like getting taken to America's dumbest criminals compound.

185,csabol-17305,Not Good,1,16 February 2020,"Listen! I get it. I get that it's Santa Clause and it's fantasy. Yet in a context in which we are to believe that the real trumps the super-natual, which in fact it doesn't, there are far too many flaws and unanswered questions this film gives us which makes for an unsatisfying story and confused fantastic world.
1. Like I said, this story is full of flaws. When we first see Santa Clause, he is magically jumping from house to house delivering presents to anxious children who are waiting for their new material possessions due to their virtuous behaviour over the past year. However, at the rate in which Santa is depicted going from house to house, which is about .5-1 second per house, it would be mathematically impossible for Santa to deliver presents to every single house in the world in one night, even with the ability to warp to a different continent in a matter of seconds. I won't get into all of the numbers (which I have roughly calculated) but it simply doesn't add up. That many houses throughout the world in one night?!?! Absolutely no way!! Fail!!
2. Why does Santa only go to homes where there is a chimney? I know, at the end he goes into an apartment in Mexico but as he does so Santa says ""sometimes you have to improvise"" as though Santa going into a chimney-less house is a huge rarity? So what is the film saying? That only middle class families that can afford a house with a chimney will be visited by Santa? Only the middle-class to wealthy may be graced by the presence of one St. Nick on Christmas Eve? What about the poor, downtrodden, and homeless? Is Santa too good for them? Is he prejudiced against the lower socioeconomic class??? That is what this film would have you believe! Super Lame! Fail!
3. This film begs the question, Does Santa only work on behalf of children or does he also work on behalf of adults? I broach this question because there is a part in the film when Kate climbs into Santa's bag of gifts and is then whisked away into a seemingly bottomless world filled with presents for all the world to enjoy. As Kate floats through Santa's bag she is seen passing by myriad Christmas gifts which would constitute a variety of age groups in which Santa delivers to. The most notable present we see is a convertible automobile. Immediately when seeing this car it begs the question, ""well who is that for?"" Surely no child is in need of a car which in turn would make the sporty automobile for an adult. So who gets the car and why? If Santa has the ability to give the gift of a new car, then why wouldn't he do so to everybody who asks? What constitutes getting a car and not getting a car? And, if Santa had the ability to bring valuable things to those who ask, then why wouldn't he do it for the poor and needy? Because they were bad? Furthermore, we learn that Santa Clause has some sort of omniscient ability in that he knows very personal and intimate details about every person on earth. If this in fact is the case then surely he would know about people's personal struggles with alcohol/drug addiction, familial problems, and economic desperation. Yet, Santa shows no empathy or compassion for those people because they were ""bad"" so they must stay mired in their own difficulties and receive no presents. This shows Santa to be a morally sadistic character who has the power to help those in personal turmoil but chooses not to do so. How are the viewers to look at Santa with anything but hate and anger? The Christmas Chronicles gives us a Santa Clause that is full of evil and maliciousness. Fail!
4. Perhaps the most obvious flaw in this movie, at least to me, is the perceived legend of Santa Clause we are given. Early on in the film we are led to believe that Kate's older brother Teddy has contempt for Kate because she is continuing to hold on to the idea that Santa Clause indeed exists and reads letters sent to him at the North Pole. ""How stupid of an idea"", we can presume Teddy must be thinking! No rational or sane person with any form of intellectual feasance could believe that an old man who lives at the north pole and flies around on a sleigh with magic reindeer delivering presents to every household on the planet could exist, right?!?! I mean the entire premise of the film is built on this idea! But riddle me this Batman... In the world of The Christmas Chronicle, every year since people have existed in a civilised society there have to have been unknown gifts that have appeared underneath the christmas tree on Christmas morning. That unknown gift from ""Santa"" that your wife, children, and friends got with no paper trail of purchase whatsoever or complete befuddlement amongst loved ones as to who gave these gifts wouldn't leave any sort of suspicion among anybody??? I mean, if every single person since the start of time were to receive some unknown gift(s) every 25th of December and there was absolutely zero evidence that came from anybody in your familial or social circle then the legend of Santa Clause would in no way shape or form be legend but in fact would be unequivocal scientific truth! How are we to suspend belief that every single person on earth is ignorant of unknown presents that mysteriously appear every year??? Absolutely assanine and stupid!!! The entire premise of the film is impossible! Complete and utter fail!!!!!
5. OK, this one has been touched on before but it really bothers the hell out of me so I'll just spend a minute talking about it. This notion that if you do good solely for the purpose of receiving material goods is simply sickening. In the film we see Kate at the outset making a film a telling Santa about the good things she has done throughout the year. Because she has done these good things, Kate suggests to Santa in her video letter that she deserves to get stuff from Santa as a result of her positive actions. As I watched Kate make this film for Santa near the beginning, it depressed the living piss out of me. Kate is a very sweet and likeable girl and we can't help but love and support her as she is dealing with the death of her father and hoping with all of her might that Santa will watch her video so as to get some relief this Christmas. That accompanied with her charming personality and confidence makes it nearly inconceivable to dislike her or wish ill will on her. Yet when we listen to Kate make her desperate pleas to Santa for material gain, she justifies her wishes by stating how well and moral and good her behavior has been the past year. As far as I can tell, the film desires for us to sympathize with Kate and agree with her course of action for getting her wanted gifts from Santa! So, what is the message??? I suppose it's this: The only reason anybody should do good in the world is so you can get material possessions from Santa Clause. That's it! That's the meaning of life! That's your existential prerogative!! Do good to receive stuff!!... Seriously, what kind of ethic is that??? That is so superficial and morally bankrupt that I almost want to throw up as I write this... And I am not that moral of a person by any means!!!! What about doing good because it's just simply the right thing to do? How about doing good because it benefits your fellow man and is the best course of action for the betterment of society? How about doing good because it is the Christ-like thing to do and in the spirit of Christmas we should do good as it is pleasing to Jesus??? No no no no no!!! Why do we good??? To get more stuff from Santa!! Good God what a depressing message! Hey Christmas Chronicles... Fail!!!!
6. All right, this will be my last gripe. I've gone on long enough but I do have one last thing I want to say. This is connected to my diatribe in #3 which I just did not have enough time to finish. One last thought and I am done. OK then, so near the end of the film we discover that Santa has the ability (maybe only in a limited sense but an ability nonetheless) to influence freewill. One of the cops, Jameson I believe, feels lonely and for Christmas wants nothing more than to reunite with his ex-wife Lisa. Knowing this, Santa encourages Jameson to call Lisa but Jameson resists due to his belief that his ex wife has no desire to speak with him anymore. Santa begs to differ and shares with officer Jameson that the feeling is mutual and Lisa is indeed interested in hearing from him too. Cutting ahead, as the film begins to come to a close we see that Santa's Christmas gift to Jameson is nothing other than a phone call from Lisa. As he sees her name pop up on caller ID, Jameson is stunned with joy and we see Santa tilt his head with a smirk and give a warm, ""Merry Christmas Jameson."" So what are we left to conclude here??? Santa Clause can influence the freewill of human beings. He can cause Jameson's ex wife to pick up the phone, dial his number, and set up a coffee date with her former beau. Wow! I mean, is this Santa Clause or is this the risen Messiah?!?! Jesus couldn't do the stuff Santa does in the Christmas Chronicles! Truthfully, I don't know what other conclusion to come to than that Santa is in fact God incarnate! Or at least he is a god with superior super natural ability. This again begs the question, if Santa can influence free will and possesses a plethora of super natural power then why did do nothing to stop some of the greatest evils and atrocities this world has ever seen??? The Holocaust, wars, famines, sexual molestation in the Church etc. The list could go on and on. And if in fact he can stop all of this evil, why does he use his power to fulfill the superficial wishes for material goods desired by the middle class to rich??? He must be sadistic, evil, malicious, and supremely bad to have power and authority to change that which is harmful and then sit by callously and do nothing but seemingly watch! Santa is not a good guy by any stretch of the imagination but is instead an unbelievably strange and twisted character who takes pleasure in the pain.",The Christmas Chronicles

I have to say, I really enjoyed it. Kurt Russell brings a new version of Santa that is an action star and a little bit tougher, but still the Santa we all know and love. I really liked seeing how they re-invented the lore of how he gets around the world in one night, transporting the presents and other classic Santa things like knowing everyone's names/what their top childhood gift was. I got A LOT of Tim Allen in the Santa Clause vibes, ESPECIALLY when he went to jail and the police officer was asking his name. Could have sworn we were going to get a similar scene.

This marks the second Christmas season (day after a Thanksgiving) we've watched. It has everything you'd want in any film let alone a Christmas movie. Touching family drama, hysterical comedy, action sequences, big budget effects, and stellar A list acting.Kurt Russell has always been one of my favorite actors. But it appears to me, Hollywood and the viewing public have always pegged him as a B+/A- actor. He never got the roles, fame, or fortune that many of his lesser talented peers received. Who'd thought playing Santa Clause would dispel that myth. After seeing this movie....rack your brain for one of his contemporaries who could have played the part better? His take on Old St. Nick is brilliant!Christmas Chronicles thoughtfully takes your emotions on a cinematic but relatable roller coaster. Belly-Ache laughs to ""get me the tissues"".

Enough with the Hallmark and the Lifetime romantic foolishness - this one has mega star Kurt Russell as the coolest Head Elf Santa to hit the screen in years. No obese ho ho ho-ing old guy in a velvet suit. Kurt in red leather trimmed with hopefully] faux fur trim and Doc Martin's, rocks out with the likes of Steven Van Zandt - and that jailhouse scene stole this show. Was Kurt Russell really singing? He sure had the rock star confidence and swagger, but there is no confirmation anywhere on the internet.
The basic plot is two kids and their mom struggling with their first Christmas without Dad - who learn in the process that they can still be a family. Big bro Teddy is headed down the juvenile delinquent path, until he learns the power of believing. Ah the Power of Christmas Magic!
LOVE the Elves - yeah, ok, they're some sort of Nordic Gremlin cat things, but they grow on you pretty fast! Goldie Hawn as Mrs. Claus was great casting. Overall, this one hits the mark -- with all the joy and magic of the Season.

It's not really ever bad as such just never that good either. The CGI is terrible and the elves also look pretty bad.Kurt Russell does play a great Santa though and is the highlight of this film. Just nothing really all that special and the humour often misses the mark as well. Still having said all this i've seen much worse. Not a bad way to waste a couple hours and get into some Xmas spirit.,The Christmas Chronicles

235,jenny-talksalot,Best Xmas film in years! #Believe,10,23 November 2018,"I was blown away by this film. I don't usually do anything Xmas until December but this caught my eye. I was ready for a run of the mill Xmas movie which I could have on in the background. Kurt Russell was a big reason I gave it a go. Boy was I surprised! The humour was spot on, the story was great, the feels were there. Honestly, I felt like a kid again with that magical heart flutter and excitement at --the prospect of-- being a believer. I did shed a tear or two, and I'm not embarrassed to admit it. But I also had many many giggles. Will definitely watch again. The elves were cute and had great personality, I loved the interaction, and fairytale feel they offered. The reindeer were spot on and so beautifully mastered.This was beautifully written and masterfully brought to life. It had all the elements of a decent, well thought about, family film. The effects were superb and if I had been to the cinema to see it on the big screen, I would not have been disappointed.Well done Netflix, you really excelled with this one. Especially with the casting. It's going to get another watch before Xmas!I have to go now and write my letter to Santa. Merry Christmas! X",The Christmas Chronicles
236,Ellerina97,Ahh I loved it,8,3 December 2020,This film is sure to become a classic! I loved it! The plot is different but kind of reminded me of the Santa Clause films in the tone. Definitely worth a watch for kids and adults. The only thing which I didn't like at first was the elves. They kinda scared me and are not what I expected the elves to look like but once you get used to them they're really funny.,The Christmas Chronicles

The main theme of the movie is bit same like others, but still it gives different messages at different times. A funny and a heart warming relationship is shown between silblings. The Santa's character is just what to kids want to be it like. Kurt Russell reall nailed it. He did the justice to this memorable role. All the supporting cast were good as well. And the children played the their parts amazingly well. This movie should be on your list during the holiday season. Also make sure to watch it with your family and friends to lift up the Christmas spirit .Ho Ho Ho!",The Christmas Chronicles
238,bcaffoe,Charmed,7,27 December 2020,"My folks turned me onto this one. My Dad said it was a cute movie and fun to watch.Being the day after Christmas, Boxing Day I believe is the name, if anyone knows what that is. Anyway, I thought I'd give it a try. It doesn't re-create the wheel, pretty standard fair for a family Christmas movie. Opening scenes show a happy family that is shattered when their Dad dies on duty as a firefighter.While the family is affected by this, the children are the focal point of the story; most specifically, the oldest son has the true character arch, being renewed and restored. It tries to weave in the sea of belief/faith, but I am not 100% sure those panned out.I've always said the key to good movies/books is two things: characters and plot.This movies gem is its characters. The brother and sister duo are endearing and charismatic. The little girl is sweet, and she has an infectious personality. The brother is charming, though broken from heartache.Kurt Russell was a scene stealer though. He made an excellent Santa. I thought they were going use the classic tough-guy trope for Santa. They did but didn't too. Russel's Santa is magical. There is a grace in his demeanor and love in his speech that you can't help but be charmed by. Every interaction he has with another person, I was completely captivated by the dialogue. If Santa were to walk the streets, I could see the conversations playing out like this.It's a fun and simple movie. Definitely a win for Netflix. I would consider adding this to my Christmas collection.",The Christmas Chronicles
239,trojanhorsezero,This film is good!,8,15 February 2021,"It's great to have Kurt Russel as Santa in this film and the sequel. The main kid characters, I like them, even though Teddy can be a jerk-butt. Having one of the people who worked on the Harry Potter films do this one is just an ingenious idea!

If they do, hope Goldie has a bigger role, just love seeing those two together.",The Christmas Chronicles
245,SpitfireLil,"Very Watchable, Fun Movie",8,24 November 2018,"I just wanted to see Kurt Russell in his beard (maybe a carryover from The Hateful Eight). What I got was a very well done Christmas movie that wasn't cartoonish, preachy, or sappy. The kids' acting, possibly because of the writing, was a little stilted in places, but overall was good. The CG was good, as well, with only a few places where I saw things that could have been done better (I do 3-D animation, so I tend to look for things like that). The elves were excellent!
Overall, the story was good, the humor was clever and refreshingly restrained, and some of the ways things were handled (the sleigh slowly travelling overhead as Santa zips from house to house and the toy bag) were very interesting concepts. Of course, there are some weak spots, but every movie has 'em.Kurt Russell's a great Santa and this movie was a pleasant surprise.",The Christmas Chronicles

247,mrlanceb,Merry Christmas Roller Coaster,10,29 November 2018,"It all begins poignantly enough...Teddy and his little sister, Kate, live with their widowed working mother. Kate savors the memories of her late holiday-sentimental father through his old video camera, which is her constant companion. Teddy, on the other hand, is prone to hitting the streets and acting out. When Kate discovers compelling evidence that Santa has actually visited their home during a previous Christmas, she hatches a plan to capture him fully on tape. After she compels Teddy to help her, this ride launches into full speed.I have seen Kurt Russell on screen since he was a boy. Now, after more than 50 years of playing action/adventure/comedy/drama heroes, he shines in this role of Santa. The rest of the cast puts on great performances as well, with Judah Lewis and Darby Camp joining Russell to round out a strong trio. The characters are natural, the police are not played as fools, and the bad guys actually seem bad.The directing is strong and well-paced, with attention to detail that keeps things entertaining at every turn. The music throughout is excellent, and includes a clever musical number. There are some familiar themes and elements, no doubt, but they are handled with enough new flavor and don't seem recycled.This is a Christmas movie you and the kids might want to see now and during many holiday seasons in the future, as it rightfully takes its place among the really good ones.",The Christmas Chronicles

249,toyotamanus,Not A Hallmark Movie,8,29 November 2020,"To start, Kurt Russell makes an amazing Santa. He's a little rough around the edges Santa, but doesn't quite understand how to make things happen socially (you'll see what I mean if you watch the movie).The movie combines humor with some heartwarming scenes, and to be honest it gets a little corny and over the top at some points, but if you follow the movie you get it.This does not fall into your the ""Hallmark Movie"" category because it involves things that one would never find in those types of movies. Plus it keeps the ""shmoopiness"" if you will, to a minimum. Throw a little action into the mix and it's a great blend of attributes that make a great Christmas movie. This may be added to my classic collection of Christmas movies that I watch each year.Why not a 10? Some of the scenes were a little too corny and over the top for my personal taste, and in some brief areas the movie did lose a little of my interest. Otherwise a solid 8 in my book!",The Christmas Chronicles

255,A_New_Hope,Even Jack Can't Put This Movie Back On Track.,3,24 November 2018,"Kurt Russel is a god, he has never played a bad role... until now. This movie is something i would never have expected Kurt to appear in. Its c grade, straight to dvd. I was expecting something along the lines of The Santa Clause but ended up with something more like Jingle All the Way 2 in terms of production value.The writing is horrible, dad dies but is the main reason christmas is special (Hallmark right?) The mum works all the time and so its just the two kids at home well when the son isn't stealing cars and not getting into trouble for it... The girl playing the daughter tries, oh god she tries but she doesn't pull it off, the guy who played the son well he might as well have been reading from cue cards, he called that performance in. Kurt however is amazing except for the jail musical. Santa has all these powers but doesn't use them to prove he is who he says he is.
The elves look like the rejected version of gremlins and they speak a simish language.Long story short, the siblings become closer, mum doesn't learn anything or grows in anyway, the boy learns not to be a jerk and the girl... learns she can get better than a d in spanish... yep you heard me.This is something to watch if you are a little out of it for the holidays or if you have kids.Netflix needs to up their game if there is a sequel.",The Christmas Chronicles

We watched this Christmas movie and I will give it a 8.8/10. First the negatives: 1. Santa Claus does not steal cars. 2. The title is the Christmas Chronicles and that is just plain dumb. It should have been titled ""Santa lost his bag"" or ""Santa's hat"". 3. Elves seem to fight a lot in today's Christmas movies. The positives about this movie are: 1. Kurt Russell is quite amusing as Santa Claus, and the two children do a good job as actors. 2. the reindeer look great and the scenes with Santa sleigh are pretty magical. 3. The North Pole looked fantastic and little children will definitely be in Fantasyland.

But this movie, that started out as your typical cliche ""kids help Santa save Christmas and learn a lesson in the process"" film, quickly turned into something wonderful. I usually watch these films by myself while I work and decide whether or not to get my family to watch it...but this time, my family loved it and was actually upset that I watched it without them.Seeing the interesting take on the function of Santa's bag as a portal to the North Pole, the use of Elvish (actually what I think is a Nordic dialect) instead of all English, finding out that dear old Goldie is Mrs. Clause, and learning that all along it was Santa helping the kids regain their Christmas spirit after their dad died...made this a truly unexpected and worthwhile holiday movie.And finally, finding out that Chris Columbus is one of the producers made perfect sense that this film would have all the classic characteristics of his 90s films where the kids are taken seriously and not just there as your typical brat who needs to be taught a lesson.Last year, Get Santa (from the UK) was my favorite.

305,KevTheMovieReviewer,This was an unexpectedly great film,9,27 November 2018,"It has now surpassed the Santa Clause movie as probably one of the best Christmas films out there for me. Russell played a fantastic, modern Santa and the kids, Camp and Lewis, did a fantastic job acting for this. I guess that when you are filming for a Christmas movie the mood is much better and everyone has fun with it. You didn't see much of Hudson or Paisley in the film but they were a great couple. The story was about the kids journey helping Santa fix the mess that they inadvertently created.There was a lot of humor, loads of action and even some emotional moments. The CGI used was brilliant. Great scenes flying around in the sleigh and travelling around the world. Even the sleigh just hanging in the air with the Reindeer was masterfully done, especially when it interacted with the kids, you couldn't tell they were computer generated.The film is only available on Netflix but I know most of you must have it by now. It truly is a magical film that not only the kids will love but the adults as well, I did. This is now on my 'Watch Again' list for sure, every Christmas.",The Christmas Chronicles

(the green one, not the orange one)!I don't want to get too carried away with sharing, but after my Mom passed two days after Christmas in 2013, I haven't smiled all that much during the holidays, until I watched this movie.Whatever your issues with the world, this just might distract you long enough to smile as much I did.Now, I also must mention that I was very content not to have this movie bogged down with tiresome religious overtones. (some imagination really hits the spot) If that sort of thing interests you, you will probably enjoy this movie. That is all.Have a great holiday season (if you can),

The family-friendly adventure, about two kids whose Christmas Eve mission to capture Santa Claus (Kurt Russell) leads to helping him save the holiday, plays like a love letter to producer Chris Columbus' previous works without ever distinguishing itself. With its saccharine score, saturated cinematography, and trite platitudes, the film is formulaic and forgettable except for Russell's performance as the lovable legend.",The Christmas Chronicles
319,stuartsadler-32464,Kurt Russell could sell ice to the Eskimos,7,25 November 2018,"Make no mistake, this movie is utter hog wash. From the mis cast child actors to the creepy elves. Then theres the bludgeoning ""true meaning of christmas"" message it tries to drill home at every turn. But, and it's a big but, it has an ace up it's sleeve. Kurt Russell sells this like it's the last job he'll ever have (which isn't beyond the realms of possibility) oozing chisled Hollywood charisma out of every pore. What's even more impressive is the fact that he doesn't just take the pay cheque and dial in a performance, he smashes his Santa out of the park and looks like he's enjoying every second of it. Worth seeing for him alone.",The Christmas Chronicles

The special effects were awesome and added brilliantly to the magic of the story. A heartwarming adventure and one we will enjoy watching year after year. We think it is sure to become a classic!

""So a few brats don't get presents - it's not the end of the world!""

At its best the movie shines with new ideas on how Santa Claus delivers all his presents in one day. Which I found that prior films never touch on as much. At its worst it's way to LONG. The movie was going well and smooth and takes a detour at some point. Overall it's a could watch 1 time type of film,The Christmas Chronicles

I thought it would be a nice little romp I could leave running in the background while I took my weekend nap.Wrong! In spite of the bittersweet, saccharine beginning I was hooked because that little girl is so cute and earnest in her Santa belief. And then Kurt Russel showed up ... and I bade goodbye to napping.

375,Kriebel,Good old Christmas fun,8,26 November 2018,"Let's be honest: when you hear ""Christmas movie"" you are going to expect cliches, mediocre storylines and some really sappy scenes about the meaning of Christmas. Especially when Santa is actually shown in the film. This movie is no different, but it is a lot of fun.Kurt Russell plays a fun, albeit naughty-list worthy Santa. There's definitely some laughs to be had and the ending is about as corny as it gets. The kids do a decent job at acting like siblings. The scenes at the police station are pretty weird and silly, they're definitely worth a giggle.If you're looking for Citizen Kane: the Christmas feelgood version, this is not the movie for you. But if you want a decent Christmas movie that you can watch with the whole family while enjoying Christmas cookies and hot chocolate, I would wholeheartedly recommend watching the Christmas Chronicles.",The Christmas Chronicles

A huge upgrade over Tim Allen's Santa Clause (Granted, Allen is good as Santa, IMHO, Russell is just a home run.)The way the believers and non-believers are dealt with is refreshing and fun and I challenge anyone to be enjoyed by anything an hour and 45 minutes long during this Holiday Season.Bravo Netflix and Kurt Russell... you did it, you really did it.

I appreciate that Netflix put this thru their service and not in the theaters.Kurt Russell was a fantastic surprise in his portrayal of Santa! I admit to being worried, but man did he nail it. As with The Santa Clause, The Christmas Chronicles tells the mystery of Christmas in a real and a magical way. Spoiler alert - stay with the story at the start. It is not slow, just a little confusing in a Christmas movie and probably why it has a TV-PG rating. But I guarantee that it all ties together in a story that will have you smiling, laughing out loud, and even joyfully misting up too.And oh my the elves!!You really need to watch if you love Christmas.Merry Christmas to you and your family.",The Christmas Chronicles

The two kids ask if he actually says ""Ho ho ho"" and he replies ""Oh that's a myth... just fake news.""

While I wasn't particularly a fan of the performances given by Judah Law or Darby Camp, I was somewhat invested in them and was especially intrigued by the struggles of the older brother.

Kurt Russel is a brand new Santa. His Santa makes you believe in Magic Again.Ignore the critics and cynics. They have sadly lost the joy of Christmas, lost their inner child and seem to only find value in the snobbery of the pseudo-intellectual and not in sweet innocence with enough elbow jab family-style adult humor to make kids and grown-ups light up this Yuletide.I hope Netflix brings this back year after year.",The Christmas Chronicles

423,brian-a-miller84,Humbug To The Haters...,7,17 December 2018,"Christmas flicks are a notoriously patchy genre; for every classic like Gremlins, and Home Alone, you have clunkers like Santa Claus: The Movie and Jingle All The Way. All too easily filmmakers can ladle on the syrupy sentimentality, and all you're left with is a sugar rush migraine and a bad taste in the mouth.So it was some trepidation I took a chance on The Christmas Chronicles. Thankfully my fears were unfounded. Yes; it hardly reinvents the wheel, and it doesn't so much push buttons as sledgehammers them home, but it has a bright and breezy, joyful feel to it that so many family oriented pictures are sorely lacking in this day and age.The story is simple, if slightly well worn; two siblings still coming to terms with recent tragedy set up a stakeout on Christmas Eve to catch Santa in the act, but in the process end up causing mayhem, on the lam and desperately trying to restore the magic of Christmas before the sun comes up on the big day itself. Mischief and mishaps abound, life lessons are learned, bad asses are kicked and everything gets tied up in a slightly misty eyed, yet satisfying bow before the end credits roll.While it may not have all the surface gloss of a major studio tentpole, or the emotional heft of the 20th Century Christmas classics like It's A Wonderful Life or Miracle on 34th Street, it has an infectious sense of fun, and Kurt Russell really is superb as an irascible, rugged Saint Nick. He is clearly having a lot of fun playing a naughty but nice version of old Kringle, and the extended musical number channeling his inner Elvis is one of the best, most unexpected movie moments for me this year.So yeah, while it might not be a total masterpiece, and not all the gags land perfectly, it is a whole lot fun, zips along at a whipcrack pace and Kurt Russell is a hot to behold as the North Poles favourite son.Will it be remembered with the same reverence as the Christmas classics of yesteryear in ten years time? Only time will tell, but if you're looking for something to get the whole family in the mood for the season, The Christmas Chronicles is a safe, if slightly too formulaic bet.",The Christmas Chronicles

443,haku_pure,"Kurt Russell, best Santa since Tim Allen.",10,24 November 2018,"I gave this movie a full 10 for a lot of different reasons.When I initially saw the trailors for this movie, I was hesitant. Not because of the actors because i'm a huge Kurt fan, but because for me it's been hard for anyone to top a Santa based movie since Time Allen appeares in the first installment of ""The Santa Clause"". And I honestly thought this was just going to be another movie trying to be just as good but failing in all aspects. The trailors from first glance made me laugh and eagor to watch. From the realistic look of the Reindeer despite their being CGI, to the beautiful look of Santa, from his suit to his beard...Kurt looked like a modern day Santa while still maintaining that authenticity. All the magic an wonder still remained true to every spirit that is Christmas.I loved this movie from the begining to the end. Kurt made Santa wimsical, comical, delightfully down to earth while still maintaining the fact that's pretty ancient. And in some scenes you have to admit...he made Santa look like a dare-devling bad-ass. He had me laughing on numerous occassions because he made Santa seem like a big kid who never really grew up. And the story is always the same, you don't have to understand Santa or how he works his magic...you just have to believe and know he's watching you.Of course Santa isn't real but this movie just grabs your Christmas imagination and let's you wonder what it would be like if we actually lived in a world where Santa did exist and what he would be like. Everyone expects Santa to seem the exact same way in every adaption but maybe that isn't the case. The CGI of the magic, reindeer an even the elves was spot on. They were so cute!And Goldie Hawn appearing at the end as Mrs. Claus was just perfect.The only thing that disappointed me about this movie is that it wasn't longer. But I came to the realization that the disappointment I felt wasn't because this movie ""could have"" been longer - an granted, it probably good have - but when the movie ended I didn't fee like they skipped anything or left anything open. It seemed fitting that it was shorter. And honestly, as movie watchers we always expect movies to be longer simply because that is what we're used to. But sometimes it sucks to see a movie drag on for almost two hours when the overall story isn't ALL that complicated. Let's face it...Santa isn't exactly a new concept LOL.What I also loved about this movie is the fact that it didn't focus on the little sister so much as it did her bigger brother. As the story plays out you realize through small tidbits that Santa wanted to help Teddy realize the magic of Christmas didn't just disappear after his Father passed away. But that it lived on even without him.I could spend this review gushing over every little detail that I loved but I think i'll end this by telling you...watch this movie. It's a great film an even better for kids. Lol I hope you love it as much as I do!",The Christmas Chronicles

It is suitable for kids as well adults, is not too religious and promotes good values. It is fun and makes you feel good about liking Christmas. It is well acted and directed. The CGI is excellent.I really liked what they did with the sleigh. Very cool.The only thing I would change is make the elves a bit more appealing and less alien and cartoonish. My elves are witty, clever and cute but independent. The elves in the move ""The Santa Claus"" were more realistic.",The Christmas Chronicles

I got to the end only because I couldn't be bothered finding something else to watch.The story itself is interesting enough, with the right amount of conflict/emotion/heartwarming moments.The acting, overall, was solid. There were some genuinely funny/moving moments, with the humour generally coming from Kurt Russell, who carried the whole movie.The problem was the frequent cringey moments and unnecessary filler scenes. Silly musical number, too much time spent on the elves... it just took too long. It was frustrating to sit through some scenes just thinking, ""Apparently time is of the essence, but we have time for this? This isn't even funny. Why am I watching this? When will it end? Why hasn't it ended yet? This doesn't even make sense.""If they cut out the filler scenes, it would have actually been a much more enjoyable movie.",The Christmas Chronicles

I may not recommend to watch it every Christmas (""It's a Wonderful Life"" still holds the top position for that), but it be on my frequent Holiday watchlist.

474,aftiley,I have ingested so much sugary sweet nonsense from this movie I am now. Type 2 diabetic,1,26 December 2018,"This movie is infuriating. I was recommended to watch it by a colleague and I shall be having words with him upon my return to work. There are so many glaring plot holes, tangents, and unecessary filler the film quickly becomes tiresome and boring, lest alone when you then have to wade through cavity sweet trite lines from the main characters.
For your reading pleasure, I have compiled a list of the severe issues with this film
if Santa didn't need his hat, why did he sit around in that jail cell and not just woosh out the door-why on earth was there something like an 8 minute 2 part musical Interlude featuring hooker backing vocalists
why did santa not use the elves before the last city to get the presents delivered?assumably, as the elves can't fly, they were parachuted down and then left to freeze as the sleigh went past-why did the boy need to shout all the reindeers names all the time? that was very tiring. Presumably it was to get the actors line count up.
why did santa need his sack, he kept producing presents out of thing ai?. He produced a god damn swing orchestra for crying out loud.-why did the elves only decide to manhandle the actual gang members and instead decide to try and chainsaw a small boy in half? Why does Santa employ a large board of small furry mouse like psychopath's?
how did the small girl learn elvish when she couldn't even speak Spanish. For that matter, why did her elvish sound nothing like anybody else's elvish and sounded more like Spanish?if Santa was fully on board with leading the kids on a wild goose chase that Christmas, why did he have a strop and say oh no we only have an hour left that isn't enough time, that seems to me very irresponsible if indeed he didn't have enough time left, he basically almost ruined Christmas himself.I am scoring this film a 2, as it is probably the worst Christmas film I have ever seen, and I include Christmas with the cranks in that.",The Christmas Chronicles

This subject touches my heart regularly because my husband is a firefighter.Asside from my personal feelings, this movie is great for all ages. There is content that will make anyone laugh. There are even some cute Fortnite dance moves involved. Of course, it is somewhat cheesy, but that is what makes Christmas movies so great!

498,stageandscreen,Put into Perspective,9,11 December 2018,"I always enjoy a good Christmas movie with adventure, kids, Santa and elves. Much of the plot has been done oftentimes before (e.g. Santa ends up in jail, Last minute present deliveries before the sun comes up, kid gets special reflective gift, etc.) but has it been done with Kurt Russell?? No it hasn't. Let me tell you, he definitely adds a great twist to the story. A Joe Cool, Elvis Presley style Santa Clause is actually a refreshing twist to the story. Even though his acting is quite indicated and a little over theatrical at times, it almost seems necessary.
Kurt brings a machismo charisma to Santa that I personally haven't seen brought to the role before.You will definitely laugh and enjoy this movie!",The Christmas Chronicles
499,ezdondirectm,"Ho-ho-hot Santa, but that's about it.",5,16 December 2018,"I wanted to like it based on the reviews, but not so much. Kurt Russell is fantastic though, and the writing for his character was quite funny. He's great. The formulaic characterizations of dead parent/sad working parent/ troubled older sibling/precocious little sister has been done to death and there's nothing original about it here. The actor playing the older brother is quite good, but I found the girl annoying in both for her lines and the acting. Tiresome. The cops were awesome though, they stepped up the acting in this.The elves are a little creepy a little cute, the Santa jail scene... well ok, kind of fun but weird too. What is with the brother getting kidnapped from the park by dangerous punks? Nothing nice or wholesome about that. The elf with a chainsaw going after the bad guy?!?

Things I haven't felt in Christmas movies in a long time. I'm happy to say this is an instant classic for me, the last being Elf. It's about time we had another holiday film worthy to add to our Christmas traditions.The story grabs your attention from the very beginning and has you caring about these characters from the start, which sadly doesn't often happen in movies anymore. The premise of the film is quite conventional, with some very unconventional twists. The excitement only grows with each scene and every actor pulls their weight to bring you a truly magical film. It's made up of fantasy, action, comedy and tender moments. It's not always exactly what you'd expect from a family Christmas film and that's one of the things that makes this story so unique, entertaining and surprisingly, has a LOT of fun action scenes. The Christmas Chronicles is also visually stunning and full of color, just how a Christmas film should be. The elves are also about the cutest thing you've ever seen. It's like when you see baby groot for the 1st time, that's the level of cuteness I'm talking about.Kurt Russell has always been one of my favorite actors, truly one of a kind and perfect for the role of a one of a kind Santa, he simply shines. He's everything I never knew I wanted Santa to be. You've never seen a Santa quite like this before, a Santa with a bit of an edge and a little on the crazy side, but I mean that in the best possible way. Russell is the one that really brings the story to life.In the end it leaves you feeling full of joy and so much Christmas spirit. Only a grinch could find much fault here. I also have to say (without any spoilers) I was so incredibly pleased for the cameo I was hoping for. Didn't know if the character would make it into the film, but it's a special treat and the perfect way to end the story. I hope the adventures continue in a sequel, as there was much to yet be uncovered, but even if it never does, it's a beautiful story the way it is.",The Christmas Chronicles

The Christmas Chronicles is a perfect Christmas movie in so many ways. The acting, especially by Kurt Russell as Santa Claus, is charismatic, yet human enough to make Santa believable.

Sure the story is cliche' but what else could it be. That's just the nature of Santa movies at Christmas.

Could have been a pay-for movie...but glad I was able to watch it on Netflix.Best part for me was the musical number (thought of the Elvis movie that Kurt was in). The actors did a fab job, particular the girl who played Kate. At the end when Mrs. Claus walked onto the scene (back facing the camera) I blurted out to the family who I thought the actress was and I was so happy to be correct! Great family film.

Kurt Russel shines in such a way you think the role was made for him.

I went in to it with great apprehension and the minute Santa appeared on screen I was hooked! From his suit to his boots and the best hair and beard ever, Kurt Russell breaths life into what had become a predictable jolly old man! The realism of the reindeer the CG of the elves and the language of Santa and the Elves ""Elvish"" all blend together seamlessly! This is going on my Christmas watch list for many Christmases to come! Santa granting Kate's final wish before he leaves her and Teddy at their home was the best of the famous line ever uttered in any Christmas movie, Kurt Russell brought that line up from his toes! The surprise at the end was delightful and fun! 10 stars is not enough for the joy this movie will bring for many years to come!

With a little more music it would be competing with the Blues Brothers at Christmas. Hey how about a mash and merging of another sequel to The Blues Brothers and Christmas Chronicles? I'll leave it for all the rest of you to nominate director and screenwriter and the best musicians. This may well become, and deservedly so, a film to watch every Christmas season.

It has all the feels you want in a Christmas movie. Kurt Russell does a great job as Santa and the kid actors do a great job as well. Not overly cheesy like some of the Hallmark movies can get.

The script needed tightening up. Things seemed like they were from different movies. The jail scene was more for adults, the elves looked like they belonged in a Computer Animated TV show.

I went into this film with an open mind, especially as everyone I know has raved about it. I have to say I got exactly what I expected. More cheese than the deli counter at Asda, cliches galore and a saccharine infused storyline. Kurt Russell was either very brave or very desperate to tackle the lead role, and although he tried not to, he looked very uncomfortable and was clearly only in it for the money. I'll try not to add a spoiler here but the prison scene was embarrassing to watch.Very poor cgi on the scenes featuring the sleigh and Santa making his rounds, weak plot, and as for the elves - for goodness sake don't get them wet, and definitely don't feed them after midnight!Approach with caution, or better yet avoid completely.",The Christmas Chronicles

It had moderate special effects, an interesting, despite overused plot (Santa's in trouble. We have to save Christmas!), and Kurt Russell as Santa worked in it's favor at times. However, a cringy misplaced musical number, the edition of predictable and unfunny dialogue, and the inclusions of the elves make it seem like they finished the movie and decided that it needed to be longer. It's a decent Christmas movie for 2018, but it holds little to no staying power as I would probably not watch it again. The characters and elves are not well thought out or relatable, and I doubt many children over ten would rank this as one of their must watch Christmas movies of the season.

I have to admit, I wasn't really expecting that much but I like Christmas movies, Kurt Russell and binging Netflix... wow I'm so happy I gave it a chance, it was so much fun. It really reminded me of the 80s version of Adventures in Babysitting (which I love) and Kurt Russell is so good in this, his whole persona reminded me of when he was in Big Trouble in Little China, but a little less Jack Burton and a little more St. Nick. Great family movie and I will be watching it each Christmas along with my other ""staple"" Christmas movies from now on. Check it out and have some fun!

631,mises-15922,Really bad movie...terribly disappointing,1,27 November 2018,"So it's about two kids who somehow break Santa's sleigh and then help him deliver his presents. The kids have a ridiculous cliched backstory. I mean, we were finishing the characters' lines for them. Guess what? Daddy died. He was a firefighter and he died in a fire! And they are all angry that Daddy died. They go past a church and...yep ""i haven't gone to church since dad died"". They talk about Daddy and ""why did he die helping those other people and leave us all alone?"" I mean the dialogue was just terrible and obviously written by folks with no talent at all.The elves...they were CGI Gremlin look-alikes. They even acted like Gremlins. One of them was wielding a chainsaw in some crazy elves fighting the ""bad guys"" scene. Yes, this is supposed to be a kids' Christmas movie.Krut Russell was fine, nothing special, and he couldn't save this mess. They had some extended singing band scene in jail that was just laughable. And at the end of the movie, they had Santa hopping from building to building like it was the Matrix.Kid acting was average at best. The plot was just boring, contrived, all over the place. No one watching it with me thought it was remotely good. It was so very very bad.",The Christmas Chronicles

I am a true believer in the spirit of giving without receiving anything in return. The secret Santa, the joy of the wonder and surprise that Xmas meant and was never meant to lose. ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE, THE POLAR EXPRESS, HOME ALONE , SANTA CLAUSE, THE GRINCH AND A CHRISTMAS CAROL, all of these and more !!!! SHOOT I FORGOT MIRACLE ON 34th street , so many and now , I know it's crazy, but Kurt Russell has pulled it off, he's not Jimmy Stewart , this isn't a wonderful life or A CHRISTMAS STORY, he's no Edmund Gwynn, I think that's his name but he's original and the movie works. It hits on hard topics and doesn't try to leave too early. Characters are grown not flashed across the screen . The ending , if you know your stuff, will blow you away but it is perfect in every way . It's golden and will be watched for years to come .

What a fun movie, Kurt Russell does a great job of bringing a new face to Santa Claus. The jail house musical number Santa Claus Is Back in Town is worth the watch in its self, featuring Steven Van Zandt (Little Steven member of Bruce Springsteen's E Street Band and The Sopranos' Silvio Dante) on lead guitar.The CGI's not over bearing and the elves are funny.

Tim Allen had his day and it was good, Kurt Russell is the Santa I want to believe in. This was obviously written with kids in mind so it's best to take the little bits of pop culture with a grain of salt, because the stuff meant for you is still there too. The fact that they offer you a different view of the man than your used to and the ""that makes so much sense"" explanations for the magic make this a serious must see. On a personal note, I don't think I've ever seen my daughter sit this still for a movie that wasn't animated. 10/10 Wish I could download it forever just in case Netflix goes out of business.",The Christmas Chronicles

Kurt Russell made Santa Claus come across as a truly cool Santa Claus with authenticity and charm. Tim Allen and the Santa Claus from the original Miracle on 31st Street have always been my favorites but Russell's Santa Claus really rocked it. His version of Santa was so magical and awesome I think it must be the most accurate version of the real guy we have ever seen. When you have that much magic and charisma- why not enjoy it the way Russell's Santa does? Seems to make perfect sense. I was amazed with how much Christmas Spirit this film brought to my family last night and I hope it does the same for others. Thank you for this film. Also, thank you for all the wonderful Elvis music you put in the film:) It was a blast to watch and experience.",The Christmas Chronicles

I went into it expecting something more like a hokey Hallmark Christmas special, but if you have any inclination to fun, classic, 90s holiday movies such as Columbus' Home Alone, then this is worth your time. It's predictable at times, but I found that was part of its charm. Russell was enjoyable and funny as the straight-talking St. Nick, and the kids complemented him well. Some sections hit the brakes pretty hard and maybe could have been trimmed down, and some of Santa's festive tech could have benefited from a little more explanation. Overall, a great choice for sitting down with the family in some of Aunt Peggy's ugly holiday sweaters with big mugs of hot chocolate.",The Christmas Chronicles

The beginning of the movie was absolutely amazing and kept me interested for a while, then the hour mark hit, this is where my holiday spirit just collapsed. The plot just started going off track and confusing the hell out of me. Once the true believers book came out and showed Kate was a true believer that is where the movie crashed into a ravine. I do not want this to contain any spoilers cause I want as many people to read this very NOICE review without getting filtered. So I am just going to leave it at that, OH WAIT SCRATCH THAT one more thing, the elves doing the floss was the #1 thing that ABSOLUTELY RUINED the rest of the movie for me, Clay should just quit his damn role as a director and get a job in EPIC Games after putting that in there...

Hope they'll put another together next year that's just as good :)",The Christmas Chronicles

This movie was fun, touching and very well done. And OMG Santa's got some killer hair.",The Christmas Chronicles

702,mgb-36762,"Typical Formula, without the magic",2,14 December 2018,"It's a no from me.... while it tried to create a modernized Santa, he ended up being very unlikable. His gadgets were very cool & imaginative, but I feel Santa would never tell a little girl she messed up Christmas...
This movie had the typical formula without the magic.Their dad who was really into Christmas has passed and it will be the family's first Christmas without him. As a result, their mom has to work a lot at the hospital leaving her 10 year old daughter in the hands of their rebellious teenage son. I half expected the little girl to burst into the Frozen song, ""we used to be best buddies, now we're not....."" Despite her older brother going down a dark path of stealing cars & hanging out in alleyways, she's determined to have a Christmas like they've always had.When she catches Santa on film, it fuels her determination to capture more footage of the less than jolly guy. When she meets Santa he is not the fat Ho Ho hoing type she's always envisioned. Instead, he's rather unlikable, a bit delusional, and ""naughty"". His jailhouse rock concert with hookers as his back up singers & crooks accompaning him on conjured up instruments, all just seemed out of place.
Overall, the animation was great & made me wish a I had chosen to watch The Santa Clause instead. Writing was pretty terrible between unnatural dialogue & forced jokes. I also found the elves a little creepy & weird, but I could see the attraction to their troll like animation for little kids. I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed in this Netflix original.",The Christmas Chronicles
703,kiernansea,Best modern Christmas film!!!,10,14 December 2018,"Iv wished to find a modern yet believable Christmas film for my 2 boys aged 4+7 for a couple of years. They got bored of the oldies quite easily.
I must say, this film had them both GRIPPED! Including me and my partner.
We laughed, we cried, tears or happiness and sadness.
What an absolute cracker (pardon the pun) of a Christmas film.
Extremely surprised this didn't make the cinemas as it would have been a sell out movie!
We are well and truly in Christmas spirits now :D",The Christmas Chronicles
704,debstreet,New Family Favorite,10,15 December 2018,"Best Santa Ever!!! We have already watched this movie 3 times this year. What a great storyline for kids as well as adults. If you don't believe, you just might rethink your position after watching. Kurt Douglas is not a fairytale Santa but one that you can relate to in real life. The jailhouse rock band makes me smile and made the entire family dance in their chairs.
This is our new favorite Christmas movie and I'm sure it will be for some years to come. Kudos Kurt!",The Christmas Chronicles
705,alanlloyd-00061,At last a very good modern Christmas movie,9,15 December 2018,"Didn't know what to expect with this modern Christmas movie by Netflix...however I was pleasantly surprised! Very good acting/cast and excellent special effects bring this to a classic status almost immediately. The story is good and funny..watch out though as you will find that you may be crying at the end....but not from laughing 😢 which again makes this a very good, definitely will be watching it again. Thank you Netflix for bringing the Christmas spirit back again!",The Christmas Chronicles
706,kelseyprichard-06520,"Horrible storyline, great production",4,16 December 2018,"The story-line behind this movie is horrendous. It doesn't follow any structure and makes little sense. The movie is really well produced and has great effects, but I found myself struggling to watch the movie with all of the holes throughout the story-line. The most confusing and frustrating moment was at the end, where Santa gives his hat to Teddy, which he had needed to teleport around the world. Teddy asks Santa why he's giving it to him since he needs it to fly the sleigh (this was never mentioned in the movie, but at the beginning Santa had needed his hat to teleport to his sack of toys). Santa then tells Teddy that he didn't need his hat all along as if it was some ruse to get the kids on an adventure with him. However, the whole reason he was able to break out of jail and 'save Christmas' was because the elves broke in and gave Santa his hat. Is this to mean he was faking it the whole time? Perhaps this is a good movie if you're really into effects and don't care about the story-line, but if you do I strongly recommend giving this movie a miss.",The Christmas Chronicles

If your child doesn't believe or is on the border of believing in Santa, they will believe after this! This movie just makes you happy inside. My favorite scene is the song in the cell block. I would definitely recommend this movie. I would also buy it if it ever comes out on DVD.",The Christmas Chronicles
711,liamobrienismusic,Screams Christmas,6,25 December 2018,"I don't love Christmas movies. Mainly because I'm not the sappy or romantic type. And don't tell me Home Alone is a Christmas movie...anybody can write a plot that just so happens to take place during Christmas...But every so often I watch one that I really believe in (pun was 1000% intended). It's the creativity revolving around the magic of Christmas that truly takes a Christmas movie to the next level. Which brings me to this movie.Did I believe in it? Absolutely. Kurt Russell is perhaps the best Santa since the original Miracle on 34th Street. One of the biggest question marks in the Santa world is how does he get to every house in time? This movie solves it with a magical sleigh that can travel thousands of miles in mere seconds along with the beauty of CGI. The family's story is a heart wrenching one and Santa/Christmas saves them along with plenty of other characters. There is plenty of creativity here. But perhaps sometimes too much.Bringing me to what almost everybody's asking (even you 10/10 users, I know part of you all are wondering): what're with the gremlins? Oh, sorry, elves. And their weird elvish language was too much as well. I don't know if I just love the movie Elf too much, but elves shouldn't look like deranged possums after a fight with a coyote. And please just have them speak English, you could've spent all that extra budget that you used on creating that language on better actors...or perhaps, a better script writer/editor.Acting...Kurt, 10/10. The boy, meh..6/10. The girl...she gets an A for effort. And don't get me started with the inmates (the main cop, though, may have been second to Kurt!!). However, it didn't help that the script had so many lines that were either lazily written, not edited properly, or just thrown in for filler. Hard to act when the script isn't helping you. And yes, I hear you...cheesy lines are a Christmas movie must. And they are, but some of those lines aren't cheesy, they're just bad.It's definitely not a bad movie. Is it a good movie? No. Is it a good Christmas movie? Yes. Watch this at Christmas and you'll laugh, you'll cry, and want to believe Santa is real. But I've definitely seen better. By the way, I'm new here...can somebody tell me how Elf has a lower rating than this?",The Christmas Chronicles

713,oshnoshart,"Ho, Ho, Holy Fricken Wow!",6,3 January 2019,"First off; I never knew this move existed till my parents told me about it. Somehow I missed the advertisements and didn't see any trailers till today. I loved it! Kurt Russell was and AWESOME Santa stealing the hat off Tim Allen's head. It seemed obvious to be a funner, funnier more adventurous remake of Santa Claus the Movie from 1985. The design of his outfit, having human helpers to the basic plot itself... All similar. My favorite character was Kate Pierce. She had the spirited, spunky and not-too-sweet personality I'm looking for. Half the time I kept wishing she was closer or equal to my age so, I could ask her out. Of course She isn't real but, that's how believable Kate Pierce was... How amazing the actress was... All the actors & actresses were! Watch it!",The Christmas Chronicles
714,nicole-86067,A refreshing Christmas movie fit for all ages,10,11 January 2019,"Generally, I expect kids' Christmas movies to be at least a tad hoaky. While The Christmas Chronicles has it's corny moments, I was so pleasantly surprised by the depth of this movie, attention to detail (except in a couple of instances) and superb portrayals of their characters by all the actors. The magic presented in the film is so very reminiscent of the whimsical warmth you'd remember from the first Harry Potter film, Home Alone and The Goonies. Which is no surprise given they're all products of filmmaker, Chris Columbus.
The film meets supernatural with customary head-on and reveals a simultaneously simple and intense story about two kids who are finding their way through the holidays after the death of their beloved father.
While older brother, Teddy (Judah Lewis) has forgotten his Christmas spirit and is turning to crime and shenanigans as he comes to terms with the loss of his dad, his younger sister, Kate (Darby Camp)
fully immerses herself into the promise of the hope, joy and love that the holidays bring. Their mother (Kimberly Williams-Paisley), who is overwhelmed with her new role as a single parent, finds herself the soul provider and nurturer and has to work many hours at the local hospital. She's called in at the last minute on Christmas Eve to cover for a colleague.
Meanwhile, Kate, having discovered a secret interlude into auto theft by her brother, makes a deal with him that she won't tell their mom if he helps her set up a camera to catch Santa in action. He reluctantly agrees and the story gets magical! After a wild and fullhearted evening spent with Santa Claus (Kurt Russell) saving Christmas from their own mistakes, Teddy and Kate grow back together and find that hope, joy and love is still alive within them. The story is ultimately about Teddy learning to believe in himself, just like his father believed in him. He finally sees that it's time for him to step up to the challenge of his family's situation so he can become the man he is meant to be. And of course... spoiler alert... Christmas and good will is saved for all!
While I was quite impressed with the work by the two young actors, and I was excited to see Kimberly Williams-Paisley again (I always loved her), the movie wouldn't have been as phenomenal as it is without Kurt Russell. I'd be remiss not to mention what an amazing, not-your-typical and outrageously hilarious Santa he portrays. Not only are the details of how Santa does his ""Santa thing"" refreshing, well contemplated, and delightful, Russell is just plain funny. In a down to earth yet playfully sarcastic manner, he brings to life this beloved character in a way you definitely wouldn't expect.
A film for all ages, The Christmas Chronicles is sure to bring cheer and delight to anyone who still believes in magic and holds dear the memory of searching the night sky for Santa's sleigh.",The Christmas Chronicles
