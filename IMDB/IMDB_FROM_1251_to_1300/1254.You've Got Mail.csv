0,TheLittleSongbird,"Inferior to Sleepless in Seattle, but still an enjoyable film.",8,20 July 2009,"What I liked most about Sleepless in Seattle was its wit, humour and charm. You've Got Mail has the charm and the humour evident in the performances and chemistry of the actors, however it just lacks the wit of Sleepless in Seattle. Both Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan give excellent performances, and their chemistry is believable. The supporting performances from Greg Kinnear, Jean Stapleton and Parker Posey are also impressive, if careful not to overshadow the two leads. The music is lovely, and the backgrounds of New York are especially nice to look at. The direction is good, if lacking the extra bit of sparkle that was used in Seattle, and sometimes the script and story is a tad underdeveloped. But as a romantic comedy, I really liked it, it is very sweet and good natured and it makes me feel good. So I will give it a 7.5/10. Bethany Cox",You've Got Mail
1,SnoopyStyle,None of the magic of 'Sleepless',6,6 April 2014,"Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) runs a small neighborhood children's book family store handed down to her from her dead mother. Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) runs a large corporate box store about to put her out of business. Unbeknownst to either one of them, they are the best of internet friends. But in the real world, they can't stand each other.Director Nora Ephron rejoins with her 'Sleepless in Seattle' leads. The biggest difference is that the magic isn't there this time around. Sleepless doesn't let them get together until very late in the movie. Yet the radio talk show phone calls allow more magic in the story than the tippy tappy quippy internet correspondence. This time around, the forced separation really damages the movie. Having them involved with different people does nothing but drag out the movie. It does improve markedly when they are together after the closing of the store. This is not a special rom-com but it's reasonably acceptable.",You've Got Mail
2,boblipton,Cheap and easy,6,15 March 2002,"Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have great screen chemistry.  All of their movies show it.  And for the first three quarters of this film, they light up the screen.  This is the third time this movie has been made.  The first time, it was Ernst Lubitsch' THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER  and a delight.  The second time, it was IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME and Judy Garland's songs and a brief turn by Buster Keaton made it a delight.This time, however, despite a sharp beginning and middle, the movie collapses at the end.  Nora Ephron's movies seem to do this all the time: you start to notice the easy manipulation of the audience, and then she rushes the ending to get it over with.",You've Got Mail
3,Prismark10,Pen pals to the end,4,31 March 2014,"The updated remake of The Little Shop Around the Corner that starred James Stewart reunites Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan who were both successful in Sleepless in Seattle.Hanks is Joe Fox whose family owns the big book store chain Fox Books, the pile em high discounted store with a coffee kiosk inside. They have just opened a new store near a small independent bookshop owned by Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) whose business is soon adversely affected.However both characters are also anonymously emailing each other and have been for some time and have a close and fond relationship but as business rivals they have an abrasive one as well has having respective partners.As a comedy-romance the film does not work and lacks the charm of the original. The IT element has aged the film (just check the dial up tone!) In fact they do not email but chat. The corporate politics is all over the place, both types of bookshops would now be suffering from online retailers such as Amazon which the film could had made reference to. Also Ryan shows her support for small retailers by drinking in Starbucks every day. What about standing shoulder to shoulder with an independent coffee shop?To me the film seemed to drag, the lack of charm in both characters hindered and I liked both their partners more.",You've Got Mail
4,jboothmillard,You've Got Mail,6,12 September 2005,"Director Nora Ephron, reunited by Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan who previously worked on Sleepless in Seattle with her, has created another romantic comedic like drama film about the secrets spread to someone but not by vocal. Basically Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) is a really bored book shop owner who wants to find someone to talk to, over the internet by email. He finds someone who refuses to give her name, just like him, and it is obviously the main girl, Kathleen Kelly (Golden Globe nominated Meg Ryan). After a while of talking to each other about their lives and their problems and interests, he decides he wants to meet this person. He doesn't know it (until later) but it is the woman who is trying to beat his book business with hers. But don't worry, there's a happy ending. Good!",You've Got Mail
5,moonspinner55,"Cookie-cutter romance, but Meg Ryan radiates with charm",7,9 July 2006,"Pleasant, warm-hearted fluff reworking 1940's ""The Shop Around the Corner"" (remade initially in 1949 as the musical ""In The Good Old Summertime""). Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan reteam for the second time as rival bookstore owners in New York City: she operates a Mom & Pop bookshop, he's opening another outlet in his retail chain nearby. They lock horns over business, yet are unaware they are also each other's internet pen-pal. Slick and occasionally too-cute, too cookie cutter, but also an entertaining picture nicely set during the holidays. Ryan can't help but radiate personality and charm, though Hanks is curiously rote here (and he looks tired to boot),. Terrific supporting cast certainly helps, with Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey, Jean Stapleton and Steve Zahn making up a bright ensemble. Engaging, if you're not too demanding. *** from ****",You've Got Mail
6,sunwarrior13,Romance In The Digital World,9,28 December 2011,"Sleepless in Seattle director Nora Ephron originally made a name for herself as the writer of romantic comedies such as Heartburn and When Harry Met Sally. She continues the genre with You've Got Mail, marking her second collaboration with actors Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. The story brings romance and courtship into the electronic age of the World Wide Web via e-mail and chat rooms. The film is about two letter-writing lovers who are completely unaware that their sweetheart is in fact the person with whom they share a certain degree of animosity. An adaptation of Parfumerie was previously made as The Shop Around the Corner, a 1940 film by Ernst Lubitsch and also a 1949 musical remake, In the Good Old Summertime by Robert Z. Leonard starring Judy Garland. You've Got Mail updates that concept with the use of e-mail. Influences from Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice can also be seen in the relationship between Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly — a reference pointed out by these characters actually discussing Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennet in the film. Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly live and work blocks from each other on New York City's Upper West Side. Their lives are practically intertwined. They both shop at the same place, frequent the same coffee shop, and even own competing bookstores on the same street. They also both have significant others of their own. Joe has the overly hyper book editor Patricia Eden, while Kathleen lives with the scholarly newspaper columnist Frank Navasky. Then they meet in a chat room. Though they keep their identities secret as they're known only by screen names ""NY152"" and ""Shopgirl"", they tell each other everything about their lives, including their private feelings, which slowly turn into affection for each other. When Joe decides to open a new branch of his ""Foxbooks"" chain that risks putting Kathleen's ""Shop Around the Corner"" out of business, the tension between them escalates. Surely her boutique business will be lost to the conglomerate with a built-in newsstand and coffee bar. When Joe sees Kathleen waiting for him in the restaurant where they agreed to meet up, he puts two and two together, but cannot face her, given their agreement not to reveal each others' names and professions. How can he reveal himself to her now, knowing that he is the cause of her misery? Hopefully, love will conquer all.It is a love story destined to be remembered as one of the best of the decade.Tom Hanks,Meg Ryan and America Online certainly are popular trademarks in the 90's.Chemistry between the leads were truly outstanding after they have previously worked with director Nora Ephron from another movie in the past.It has great humor and witty lines.Also,it was interesting as we get a glimpse of what romance will be in the digital world in the years to come.Although it is not a classic nor a masterpiece,it is still a must-see for people who love good romantic stories.",You've Got Mail
7,studioAT,The 'Sleepless in Seattle' team reunite...great,3,2 January 2017,"The trailer and DVD box bangs on a lot about the fact that this film reunites the three main players from mega hit 'Sleepless in Seattle' (Ephron, Hanks and Ryan) as a way of drawing us into this film, but forgets one small thing - what if you weren't that keen on 'Sleepless in Seattle' in the first place? I thought this film was OK, just OK. It has its moments, and Hanks/Ryan undeniably have good chemistry, but I certainly wouldn't rush to see it again. In fact all of the good moments were in the trailer.Due to the fact Ephron is directing this and 'Sleepless' are very similar, so if you didn't go mad for that film i'd avoid this one.",You've Got Mail

9,Doylenf,"Another charming re-tread of ""The Shop Around the Corner""...",6,13 September 2006,"This time, instead of two people corresponding as pen pals and finding letters in their special post office boxes, we have them using the internet to find romance in cyberspace. And using smart looking New York backgrounds in lush color, upgraded technology to bring two would-be lovers together, and other modern sensibilities to the timeworn plot, Nora Ephron has come up with another charmer.TOM HANKS and MEG RYAN are the couple who can't tolerate each other when they work together but find out that they're actually soul mates when they correspond anonymously through e-mail messages. And in an age where couples are meeting and dating and eventually mating and marrying, thanks to computers, the story works and gets the benefit of a modern look.While it's unlikely that this will reach the popularity of SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, it's definitely worth a look just to enjoy the simple performances of Hanks and Ryan. GREG KINNEAR has a good supporting role and it's all brisk and amusing and easy to take.",You've Got Mail
10,zardoz-13,"""You've Got Mail"" Qualifies as a Pleasant, Mushy-Ado-About-Nothing Yarn that Should Offend Nobody",7,2 August 2008,"Love conquers all between two bad-for-each-other individuals in the predictably saccharine but tolerably entertaining romantic comedy ""You've Got Mail"" that reunites writer & director Nora Ephron with her ""Sleepless in Seattle"" co-stars Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan as rival booksellers in the Big Apple who woo each other anonymously via the Internet when they aren't at war with each other in the real world. Sappy cinemaphiles who rhapsodized about ""Sleepless in Seattle"" inevitably will applaud Ephron's simple but charismatic recoupling of Ryan and Hanks. Discriminating audiences, on the other hand, may reject ""Mail"" for being manipulatively cute, slowly-paced, and thinly plotted fodder.Ostensibly, Ephron's frivolous but disposable soaper updates director Ernest Lubitsch's ""The Shop around the Corner."" In that venerable but uneven 1940 comedy, James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan portrayed two clashing curio store clerks who exchange anonymous but endearing letters. Incidentally, not only did Miklos Laszlo's play ""Parfumerie"" serve as the basis for the Lubitsch comedy, but it also inspired director Robert Z. Leonard's 1949 musical ""In the Good Old Summertime"" that mated Judy Garland with Van Johnson.Just for the record, ""The Shop around the Corner"" ranks as no great shakes itself. Maudlin and claustrophobic, with a subplot featuring infidelity and suicide, the Lubitsch comedy is still rather depressing for a film produced during the Golden Age of Hollywood. ""Michael"" director Nora Ephron and sister Delia Ephron have adapted Samson Raphaelson's ""Shop"" screenplay, preserving its better parts and contriving a few twists of their own. In their warm and fuzzy remake, the Ephrons have changed the setting from pre-World War II Budapest to contemporary New York City. Not surprisingly, because Nora Ephron lives on the Upper West Side, ""You've Got Mail"" makes Manhattan look like the better side of the rainbow. The sisters Ephron have expanded the scope of the action, too, so that the principals no longer toil under the same roof with the same tyrannical boss.As Joe Fox, Tom Hanks of ""Forrest Gump"" plays the son of a wealthy family that owns Fox Books, a conglomerate book store a la Barnes & Noble which swallows smaller stores. Although Joe epitomizes capitalism at its most ruthless extreme, the filmmakers go to great lengths to take the sting out of his villainy. Not only do they show him taking his father's children by a second wife out to play, but they also saddle Joe with a shaggy Irish setter. Can anybody say ""Turner and Hooch?"" Conversely, as Kathleen Kelly, Ryan runs a quaint little children's bookstore named The Shop Around the Corner that her mother left her. Perky as always with her hair fashionably disheveled, Ryan appears hopelessly adorable in whatever she dons, whether pajamas or pants suit. Essentially, Hanks and Ryan are the whole show, and their cinematic chemistry has not dimmed an iota since their initial coupling in the abysmal 1990 epic ""Joe Versus the Volcano."" ""You've Got Mail"" marks the third time that they have teamed up.The conflict is pretty basic. Opening its newest superstore a block away, Fox Books poses a dire threat to Kathleen's livelihood as a longtime neighborhood staple. Unlike ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" where the Ryan and Hanks' characters eventually met at the end of the movie, ""You've Got Mail"" has their paths criss-crossing from the outset. The premise is that Kathleen and Joe meet in an-over-30 chat room at America-On-Line and have kindled a cozy e-mail relationship under the aliases of 'Shopgirl' and 'NY152.' Agreeing not to divulge any personal details, they have maintained a strictly platonic relationship. Nevertheless, they're so infatuated that they cannot wait for their live-in lovers to leave (they're singles) for work each day so that they can check their e-mail. Actually, Joe and Kathleen live only a few blocks apart, and Ephron shows early on how easily it is for these New Yorkers to walk the same streets without colliding. Joe is shacking up with a neurotic, caffeine-addicted book editor, Patricia Eden (indie movie queen Parker Posey), while Kathleen shares the same bed with a pretentious, bespectacled newspaper columnist, Frank Navasky (Greg Kinnear of ""As Good As It Gets."" Eventually, Joe and Kathleen run afoul of each other at a publisher's party where she learns about Joe's notoriety. Dislike turns to hate when Fox Books lures Kathleen's customers away with its discounted books, cappuccino bar, and chairs to relax in and read. Faced with competition that will likely sink her small business, 'Shopgirl' seeks advice from 'NY152.' He suggests that she go to war. Rationalizing everything in terms of the movie ""The Godfather,"" he refers to the mafia epic as ""the sum of all wisdom"" and charts his life by it. Meanwhile, she interprets life through the pages of Jane Austin's classic weepie ""Pride and Prejudice."" Despite the widespread protest that she generates in the media, Kathleen cannot compete with Fox, and she locks her doors after 42 years of business. Indeed, hostile takeovers of this kind raise few eyebrows in today's rabid business climate, but jarring realism of this sort seems distinctly out of place in an otherwise fluffy love story.Although ""You've Got Mail"" is a tale perfectly suited for today's technology, several obvious consequences have been overlooked. Never mind that ""Mail"" depicts women as passive and inexorably overwhelmed, makes breaking up appear like a picnic, and condones Republican style capitalism where big company gobble up small stores without a moral hiccup. Presumably, the sisters Ephron figured that audiences will dismiss these uneasy questions without a thought as they purr over the on-screen chemistry between Ryan and Hanks. Formulaic, flighty, flirtatious, and feel-good-all-around, ""You've Got Mail"" emerges also as a shameless infomercial for AOL, Macintosh computers, and Starbucks Coffee. However, another rather unsettling question lurks in the background. What if that significant other who shares this cinematic experience with you is cavorting on-line with somebody else? Hmm!",You've Got Mail
11,AlsExGal,A pleasant little romantic comedy,7,11 July 2015,"I really liked the original better - 1940's ""The Shop Around the Corner"". However, for a modern romantic comedy this one hits the spot. It alters the means of communication between the mismatched couple to email from letters. This film has Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) as the heir to a Borders-like bookstore empire whose family is opening a new store near his pen pal Kathleen Kelly's (Meg Ryan) small children's' bookstore. It is the same as its predecessor in that the pen pals actually know each other and do not like each other. It alters the basis of the disagreement to be that of Fox's big impersonal business delivering goods at a discount with the price being a largely anonymous and unknowledgeable retail staff versus Kelly's personal service and first editions that carries a large price tag for the paying customers. It turns out that, even in Manhattan, people prefer to buy discount with the result being the end of Kathleen's store. The movie keeps things interesting with several little side stories and unanswered questions. Did Joe's grandfather ever date Kathleen's mother? Did Kathleen's employee Birdie (Jean Stapleton) have an affair with Francisco Franco in her youth? Why and how did Birdie decide to buy all of that Intel stock? Then there is the whole issue of Joe's serially monogamous dad (Dabney Coleman) that plays out quite humorously and the fact that Joe has an aunt that is thirty years younger than he is. Considering Joe's mother had to be a victim of his father's philandering at some point, Joe seems to take his dad's personal habits quite casually. A very moving addition to this version of the story is Kathleen's identification of the store with her mother to the point that, when the store does finally close, she considers it to be much like her mother dying all over again.The only thing that really bothered me was the issue of Joe and Kathleen seeking other relationships while seriously involved with other people to the point of living with them and not letting on that there was anything amiss. This seemed a bit underhanded on both their parts and somewhat undermined their likability, at least to me.Now I wrote the paragraphs above several years ago. The technology was relevant to the year it was made -1997. Of course today, everybody would be texting one another, and Joe's bookstore would probably be just as extinct as Kathleen's since Amazon managed to put not just the independent bookstores out of business, but big brick and mortar chains like Border's. Of course, that is not the point of the film. The point is love finding two people who on the surface seem completely mismatched in every way, and who, on top of that, are competitors.",You've Got Mail
12,anaconda-40658,You've Got a Crappy Film.,3,23 March 2016,"You've Got Mail (1998): Dir: Nora Ephron / Cast: Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Dave Chappelle, Parker Posey, Greg Kinnear: Dreadfully predictable romantic comedy about connecting and communication. Third film collaboration between Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan. They make contact via e-mail while their poorly written significant others continue to dissatisfy them. Introducing them both as single would have left out this unnecessary rubbish. They are required to pass each other on the street and not know it, etc. Ryan owns a family bookstore handed down to her from her mother. Hanks is the son of the owner of a bigger bookstore around the corner that threatens her business. They are required to hate each other until the conclusion where Ryan cannot figure out the bloody obvious. Bookstore rivalry works but what follows is total idiocy. Director Nora Ephron is reworking Sleepless in Seattle but unfortunately she didn't counter the bullshit until Hanks came clean. Hanks does his best with the predictable tripe. Ryan plays a total airhead who cannot figure out that Hanks is sending the e- mails despite his sudden interest. Parker Posey and Dave Chappelle play flat supporting roles. And as in Sleepless in Seattle, Greg Kinnear gets to play that unnecessary boyfriend not needed for the plot. Purposely repeating Sleepless in Seattle but Ryan's airhead ways render this a return to sender. Score: 3 ½ / 10",You've Got Mail

This one also has some seriousness that gives it a more real feel. The plot is fairly original, and similar situations of big corporation versus small shops are common in real life. As Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly, Hanks and Ryan do very well at playing what become double roles. They have their personal encounters and then they have an encounter in cyberspace through email.

17,JamesHitchcock,Good-Natured Romantic Comedy,6,8 September 2004,"Contains spoilersI have mixed feelings about the decision to relocate this film, a remake of the 1940 James Stewart film 'The Shop Around the Corner', from Hungary to America. On the one hand, the use of real-life New York locations generates a greater sense of place than was possible on a Hollywood studio set that was meant to represent Budapest but could equally well have stood in for Berlin or Birmingham, Boston or Baltimore. On the other, this relocation seems to symbolise the modern closing of the American mind- the belief that those portions of the world's surface unlucky enough to lie outside the boundaries of the United States are of no interest either to Hollywood or to the American public in general. Indeed, given that most films nowadays are intended for an international distribution, it seems that even non-Americans are expected to agree with the idea that America is intrinsically more interesting than any other country. It has been said that the average romantic comedy can be summed up by the mathematical formula a + b  c = d, where 'a' equals 'boy loves girl', 'b' equals 'girl loves boy' and 'c' stands for an obstacle (or obstacles) to their love which must be overcome to achieve happy ending 'd'. That formula certainly applies to 'You've Got Mail', but the obstacles to be overcome are formidable; the girl and boy not only love each other, but also hate each other. In addition, both already have steady partners. Kathleen Kelly is the owner of a small children's bookshop in New York named, in homage to the earlier film, 'The Shop Around the Corner'. Kathleen sees herself as being less a bookseller than a woman with a sacred mission to bring the joys of literature into children's lives. (Some actresses might have made such a character seem unbearably priggish, but Meg Ryan is able to invest her with her normal girl-next-door cuteness and make her seem likable and natural despite her high-minded sentiments). Kathleen has begun an e-mail correspondence over the Internet with an anonymous penfriend, and finds herself falling for this man. What she does not realize is that, in reality, the man she is corresponding with is Joe Fox, the millionaire owner of a chain of discount bookstores. A large Fox store has recently opened close to Kathleen's shop, threatening to put her out of business. Kathleen and Joe therefore regard each other as rivals, and when they meet in person they take an instant dislike to one another, not realising that they have been corresponding with each other under pseudonyms. In the David-and-Goliath struggle between Kathleen's small family shop and the huge business empire there is a surprising result; Goliath wins. (Surprising, that is, in terms of movie conventions, if not in terms of real life). Kathleen's shop is forced to close. One might have thought that this would have put an end to any possibility of romance between her and Joe, but from this point on the film becomes increasingly artificial as the obstacles to a happy ending miraculously disappear. Joe and Kathleen's existing relationships suddenly and painlessly come to an end without any hint of bitterness or resentment on either side, leaving our two protagonists free to discover that they really do love one another after all (surprise!) In the song (and generally in real life as well), 'breaking up is hard to do', but in this sort of film it is, when the plot demands it, as easy as falling off a log. Joe's girlfriend Patricia is, admittedly, a fairly minor character, but Kathleen's boyfriend Frank (a good performance from Greg Kinnear) is a more important one. Frank is an eccentric but idealistic left-wing journalist, who seems to have more in common with his fellow-idealist Kathleen than does Joe. The course of true love in romantic comedies, however, is determined less by compatibility than by the box-office, and it is nearly always the bigger-name star who gets the girl.Of the two main characters, it is Kathleen who seems the more satisfactory, largely because she is the more consistent. Tom Hanks is a practised hand at romantic comedy, but Joe's character is an odd mixture of ruthless businessman and likable average guy. 'Ruthless but likable' is a difficult combination for any actor to portray successfully, and Hanks, who always seems more at home with sympathetic characters than with unsympathetic ones, concentrates more on the latter element than on the former. Hanks may have been cast in the role because his screen persona is similar to that of James Stewart, who played the equivalent role in 'The Shop Around the Corner', or at least to Stewart's persona in the early part of his career. (In the fifties Stewart was able to broaden his range by playing characters who are, if not downright villainous, at least flawed or ambiguous- Howard Kemp in 'The Naked Spur' is a good example). There are a number of references in the film to Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' (Kathleen's favourite book), and there is an obvious parallel with that classic novel in that it too deals with love developing between two people who initially disliked each other. The film is no classic- in many ways it is a bog-standard formulaic romantic comedy- but it has plenty of good-natured charm and an attractive heroine which make it worth watching as an agreeable way of passing the time. Among Meg Ryan's romantic comedies 'You've Got Mail' is not in the same class as 'When Harry Met Sally', but is on a par with 'I.Q' or 'Sleepless in Seattle', and certainly superior to the seriously weird 'Prelude to a Kiss'. 6/10",You've Got Mail
18,StevePulaski,"Closes the shop, opens her heart",8,17 December 2011,"Director and screenwriter Nora Ephron must've been wishing on a star when she was writing You've Got Mail. It throws caution to the wind and dares to be different, and to top it off, features two big stars playing very big roles. In simple terms, it's a big success. The rebellious films aren't the ones mostly likely to succeed but You've Got Mail does on almost every level as a romantic comedy.The story is centered around two people in two very different financial positions in New York City. Joe Fox (Hanks) is a rich and confident man who runs ""Fox Books,"" a massive store in the vein of Barnes & Noble or Borders. Kathleen Kelly's (Ryan) shop is less than a hundred feet away. There she runs a much smaller, personal bookstore the Capitalist way called ""Around the Corner."" Due to this new massive retail giant opening up she is losing customers fast and worries her store will have to close its doors.In the meantime, Joe and Kathleen should be rivals, but they have unwillingly been talking to each other and exchanging very personal conversations over the internet via a chat-room. Joe is ""NY152"" and Kathleen is ""Shopgirl."" Needless to say they don't know who each other is, but they find a certain solace in that. Maybe the advice comes less sugarcoated when you hear it from somebody you're not well acquainted with.Eventually, the inevitable happens and Kathleen's shop is forced into the ground and the remaining inventory to be bought by Joe. While this is all happening, Kathleen is also trying to get in contact with this ""NY152,"" but winds up being stood up. This is the only part of the film where I began to have a problem. It seems like the storyline and clichés past would hint that these two characters would find out the identities of one another about halfway through. Instead, You've Got Mail becomes an exercise in long, sometimes tedious pacing, and some moments we encounter leave us asking ""how did you not get that hint?"" If hadn't been for the uniquely witty writing and the terrific supporting cast I may have quickly lost interest. Supporting roles consist of Dave Chappelle as Joe's best friend, and Steve Zahn, one of my favorite men in the business today, Heather Burns, and All in the Family's Jean Stapleton as Kathleen's faithful coworkers who try to keep her optimistic when the ""NY152"" drama starts unrolling before their eyes.Going back to the internet portion of the film, who would've thought in the mid-nineties, when the internet was created and released to the public, that ten to fifteen years later it would become one of the main ways to form relationships? I could see people in 1998, seeing You've Got Mail, chuckling and rolling their eyes at the idea of one talking to someone who is seemingly a complete stranger. Years later, we do it all the time.Another thing I picked up along the way, if closely dissected, You've Got Mail doesn't seem like a love story at all. It seems like a genius drama centered around business. Here we have a very successful businessman who can create and operate a huge retail store while barely doing any work. He still manages to win the heart of his competitor even after closing her shop and making her feel extremely inferior. That's the power of big business. When closely examined, You've Got Mail is another simple and amusing romantic comedy guaranteed to charm and tear-up any lady. When looked at with a broader focus, one can see the business undertones quietly cemented in.So, my three and a half stars go to the movie and the big picture focus both of You've Got Mail. This is a crafty, yet very subtle film about love and the power of wealthy corporations. It not only has that to offer seeing as Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan create inseparable chemistry together and are complemented by the writing and directing talents of Nora Ephron.Also, it's currently 2011. I wonder how Fox Books has faired with the high sales of Amazon's Kindle and the closing of the popular retailer Borders.Starring: Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan, Dave Chappelle, Greg Kinnear, Steve Zahn, Heather Burns, and Jean Stapleton. Directed by: Nora Ephron.",You've Got Mail
19,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Oh, please, it wasn't that good",2,3 January 2007,"I was kinda looking forward to seeing You've Got Mail, because I know there were so many parodies and it is a film that over all is pretty well mentioned in a conversation of cinema. Tom and Meg would seem like a good combination for a romantic comedy, but to be honest, I wasn't all that impressed by their performances or the story itself. It seemed to dull and predictable, you know? Maybe it was just me, but it couldn't have been, because I was very happy to see this movie when I slipped it into the DVD player this morning! See what I mean? Joe and Kathleen have been e-mailing each other and having an internet romance, only they don't get personal, to where they know each other's real names or business. Kathleen works at a little bookstore where the clerks know their work and really help their customers, Joe becomes the lead manager of a new huge discount book store down the street that might destroy Kathleen's business. They fight face to face not knowing that they truly love each other through these love letters online.You can pretty much guess how the plot goes, because it is a typical romantic comedy. It isn't me either, I had asked my mom and friend who both saw this movie what they thought, and they said that it was over rated, I completely agree. It was a waste of two terrific actor's talents and the story was just nothing, it didn't work. I couldn't even call this a romantic comedy, because there wasn't any funny moments, so I'm not understanding the 6.1 rating on IMDb.2/10",You've Got Mail

22,theowinthrop,Laszlo's Play Makes It's Third Film Appearance,10,25 December 2005,"If you have been reading the last three reviews I did, this is the natural concluding review of the sequence. THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME, and SHE LOVES ME all were based (in the central plot about two people at loggerheads in physical life, falling in love through anonymity in pen-pal letters) on Miklos Laszlo's PERFUMERIE. They all had their differences in a secondary plot dealing with the jealousy of the owner of the store towards the hero (his closest employee) resulting in his firing the hero due to a serious mistake by the employer. This was jettisoned and altered in the middle film, but resumed in the Kander and Ebb musical of the 1970s (made into a television version in 1978). But that version actually gave the actual villain a parting shot in his last song, showing he was down, but not out, and would still find a way of getting an undeserved success.When Nora Ephron did her version of the play in this screenplay, the jealousy angle was dumped, and the concentration was on the business antagonism between the hero and heroine (here Tom Hanks as Joe Fox, and Meg Ryan as Kathleen Kelly). Hanks and Ryan do not work at the same store as James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan or Van Johnson and Judy Garland did. Hanks works at a mega book store (Fox Books) like Barnes and Noble. Ryan runs a small neighborhood book store for children, called ""The Shop Around The Corner"" (Hanks takes her to task for that name, saying it can't be claimed as a single corporate name). Fox Books is moving into the neighborhood that Ryans's store is in, and she fights it's irresistible push - in vain as it is. In the end not only is she the loser, but members of her staff get hired by Fox Books as well.There are other elements here that do not come out in the original version or the 1949 version. The protagonists don't write letters, but are sending e-mails to each other. Times are changing, and the discovery of a small notice in the newspaper's classified for a pen-pal is replaced by Ryan meeting Fox accidentally in surfing the internet and finding a chat room (a scene we are told of, but never see). In the 1949 film, Garland was pursued (if you will - somewhat weakly) by Johnson's friend and fellow employee Buster Keaton. Johnson was linked (by Garland) to a female friend who was a violinist. Neither relationship was that strong or threatening to the eventual Johnson-Garland relationship. But for the first half of YOU'VE GOT MAIL, Ryan is living with a self-righteous newspaper columnist (Greg Kinnear), and Hanks is living with a self-centered publisher (Parker Posey). We barely knew the families of Sullivan and Garland (we saw an aunt or two that they lived with). Here we know that Ryan's mother is dead, but her grandmother Birdie (Jean Stapleton) is alive and thriving. In fact we learn Birdie is rich due to a stock investment and that she once dated John Randolph, Hanks' grandfather. In fact, we even learn that Birdie romanced one of the most interesting political figures of 20th Century Europe. Hanks' family is developed too, beyond Stewart's or Johnson's (or Ellis's for that matter). Besides grandfather Randolph (about to remarry), we see Hanks' father (Dabney Coleman), who keeps running through wives and never finding the right mate. We also meet Hank's aunt and brother.The film worked well again, and just as the early pairs of couples (Stewart and Sullivan, Johnson and Garland) had good chemistry, so did Hanks and Ryan. This was their third film together (people forget they did JOE AND THE VOLCANO first), and the second film (after SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE) with Ephron at the helm. With all the modernization and story changes, and character histories, and assaults on the concept of mega-stores (check the scene where Hanks hears an inept salesman in the children's book section), Epron managed to show the old warhorse by Mr. Laszlo still had plenty of juice in it to go down well with the public. My guess is that like Lubitsch's original film it will end up a classic version of the story. My wonder is what will be the next version be like.",You've Got Mail
23,ElMaruecan82,A tale of Lonely Hearts slipping through the Net...,7,22 December 2017,"Kathleen Kelly runs a traditional bookstore where she tells stories to children. It's a place with warmth and soul... everything Joe Fox seems to lack, or at least the places he run.Fox has the right name since he is a practical businessman running a chain of book mega-stores a la Starbucks Coffee. Both stores are located at the opposite sides of the same Manhattan street. They're business rivals and by an ironic twist of virtual fate, they're also nighttime regular chatters on America On Line aka AOL. She'sShopgirl, he's NY152, she's played by Meg Ryan and he's played by Tom Hanks. In fact, the film could have been titled ""Sleepless at Manhattan"" as well.Now, I have a hard time buying Tom Hanks as a despicable character, or even remotely unlikable, but that's the whole point of that savory little romantic comedy, signed (written and directed) by the late Nora Ephron, you only feel guilty when you hurt people you have deep connections with. And the irony is that Internet sometimes creates deeper connections with virtual people than the one who share your life. The eagerness to check the mails to see if you've got one is still relevant today and epitomizes what we call now: an emotional affair.The film was clearly made on that cusp of the first Internet years (you know with that the awful tone when you dial on the net) and the social network hegemony we live in but it doesn't out-date it for all that. Yes, we're blasé because we know if Skype or iPhones existed, there would be no plot. But 1998 was the perfect moment to make this film, and now, it looks as a sweet reminder of how Internet used to work. It's to Ephron's credit to have exploited her witty sense of humor and sensitivity to explore a modern device most people her generation would feel estranged with. The 'e-motional affair' might provide the timeless appeal the film needs as the rest is just a succession of plot points leading to the inevitable declaration of love. We know Joe and Kathleen will get rid of their respective life partners, a self-centered workaholic played by Greg Kinnear and Parker Posey as a pompous socialite who wouldn't even be admitted in the ""Sex and the City"" clique. But the film is never as good as when the two interact behind the screens, and seem to spend the whole day on social trivialities, only to check at night if they've got mail. That felt real although I wish the portrayal of their real-life partners didn't make it so obvious they had no future together. The film could have been a subtler comment on the way people look for complementary romances on line, not plain new relationships.However, Ephron's approach to the Net is often spot-on. During the memorable chat part, there's a moment where Joe Fox is anticipating the right answer and he's just happy when he gets it, because it allows him to move forward in his courtship. OR when he tries to send the right words and wait a little before clicking on Enter. It shows that the Net was really a game-changer as far as social interactions went. In real life, you must be careful about what you say and you have no second chance. This is why they're natural born talkers behind screens but all their real-life encounters are disasters. This is why on-screen relationships seem to work better and provide the illusion that our real life sucks.The virtual exchanges also highlight an important aspect of the Internet, it has revealed the inner loneliness of people, some who never realized they were alone until they could find a person to speak with. Internet offers something called anonymousness, allowing people to speak more openly about their personal troubles, their insecurities and doubts. That's everything we seek in the intimacy of the Internet, catharsis and somewhat of an escapism, escapism in emotions or on a more existential level. And just the opportunity to talk about the things we loved.Whether Kathleen recommending to read ""Pride and Prejudice"" novel or Fox talking about ""The Godfather"", the Net becomes the area of free expression for our real selves, and this is how Hanks is never unlikable, he becomes himself behind the Net and there's an interesting twist in the way he talks Kathleen into doing things she wouldn't do usually but that end up being backfiring at him. This aspect of the story takes a subtle turn when he finally realizes who she is and maintains the virtual relationship. Then it gets more one-sided, making the ending questionable.Indeed, should have Kathleen fallen in love with the man who ruined her business? Joe wasn't mean spirited enough not to deserve Kathleen and from what it seems, the bookstore was a bit more of a burden than a precious asset. Now, maybe I have not a problem with the ending except for the fact that it happens too late, how about seeing how two people behave on the Net and see them interact in real life as lovers. The film missed many good points about the Internet and the battle between reality and virtuality, that's why the ending seems a bit forced.But the charm of the first exchanges and the acting save the film, it's perhaps one of the last performances where Meg Ryan still look like a sweetheart and Tom Hanks can have a lighthearted role after having played it so serious. The film is a nice time capsule of what was the Internet in the late 90's. Another nostalgic value to add, reminding us that 1998 will soon be 20.",You've Got Mail
24,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Conforms to convention, but does just enough with the tools of the trade and the charisma of the characters to remain engaging throughout.",6,15 May 2018,"'You've Got Mail (1998)' isn't as dated as you might think, and, if it is, it is actually dated mostly in the areas you wouldn't suspect. It brings the internet into a timeless tale of pen-pal love, a combination which has become all the more relevant in today's 'online dating' society. Where it falters slightly is in its attempts to merge this 'A-plot', which essentially becomes a 'B-plot' for most of the piece, with a secondary narrative concerning competing book-stores and the tendency for big-business to swallow family-practices whole. It's only because this takes precedent over the 'mail' aspect, and indeed the romance, for most of the piece that the narrative seems slightly confused and baggy, with a length far to long for what the endeavour hopes to achieve. It also detracts from itself because this story was never the focus and so its quick, and arguably unsatisfying, conclusion doesn't do justice to the new emphasis placed upon it. Still, when the screen-time is shifted back to the main couple and their 'will they, won't they' dynamic - which is nicely justified by Hanks' character essentially being two people, the flick finds its feet again. It manages to do a lot with quite a little. The use of dramatic irony is rather inspired and, actually, fairly unique. From the very opening, we are let into a secret that neither of our heroes know and the rest of the picture is spent teasing us with the possibility of them finding out. It is fantastically frustrating, a wonderfully considered approach that makes each encounter - and the deteriorating nature of their in-person relationship - a devilish delight. We essentially know how the film will finish from the first frame, but it does everything it can to put that end-goal as far from sight as possible. This, and the continuing need for dramatic irony on account of at least one character, creates one of the only real problems with the picture. While Hanks' character's motivation is initially sound, once he continues to allow this dramatic irony to go on he basically slips from sympathetic to sociopath, toying with this poor woman's emotions to get what he wants - even if it is out of genuine emotional connection. It's not as bad as it sounds, perhaps, but it is bad enough that it's the real reason the two should be at odds and should certainly lead to a very different outcome. Overall, this is an enjoyable romantic-comedy, though. It conforms to convention but does just enough with the tools of the trade and the charisma of the characters (or, more accurately, the actors) to remain interesting throughout. 6/10",You've Got Mail

Her mother owned and operated the store for years and, upon her death, passed it along to her daughter. Kathleen has an ongoing relationship with a newspaper columnist (Greg Kinnear) but something is wanting. That's why her favorite activity is corresponding, via email, with a gentleman she met in a chat room. She has not met this man in real life, but, hangs on his every word and the feeling seems to be returned. Meanwhile, Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) is about to open a mega bookstore just around the corner from Kathleen's small but lovely store. Joe and Kathleen meet at a party and seem to dislike each other but, more importantly, the two will be competitors very soon. Will Kathleen's store be able to survive the book wars that are coming? And, will Kathleen ever meet the cyberspace gentleman of her dreams? This is a lovely story on film, told with humor and heartwarming care. Ryan and Hanks, as they did in Joe and the Volcano and in Sleepless in Seattle, prove that they are a quietly dynamic duo in the realm of romantic comedies. The supporting cast of Kinnear, Parker Posey, Steve Zahn, Dave Chappelle, and Jean Stapleton, is also a film lover's fondest wish. Nora and Delia Ephron's script is intelligent, witty and clever and Nora's direction is quite wonderful as well. The costumes, scenery, and overall production values are fine indeed.

Well, this isn't a masterpiece that i would watch again & again to ponder about, but it is surely a good piece: The actors are excellent; maybe Ryan & Hanks will be remembered only for those romance castings, but they get the feeling for it, the chemistry between them and in a career, it is better to have one memorable label than no label at all.

And now, this is New York and this isn't the 1st town in the world for nothing.The story is enjoyable: the trick of the loving writing and the bad meeting is a good one. There are almost two movies in one and the second part is interesting: how to save a failed relationship, and ironically, that's the actual point of my life.The only drawback in this movie, like the constant big American productions, is that the characters evolve in the ""high society"". They have good jobs, fine housings, good friends, health.. In fact, their only worry is their feelings, which is per se almost ""paradise"".I know it's movie and not life: the big difference is here: movie is happy ending & smooth progression; Life can be sad even if you try your best & the ""fight"" is every day...

31,Anonymous_Maxine,Deceptively cute...,8,19 April 2008,"I'm reminded of the shallow complaints that I heard about Runaway Bride, since it starred Richard Gere and Julia Roberts, who had already starred in the astronomically successful Pretty Woman together. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are teamed up again in a nice little romantic comedy and the producers no doubt hope that people can forget Sleepless in Seattle, also written and directed by Nora Ephron, and accept an entirely new story. And like Runaway Bride, it worked. The premise of the story is ludicrous in the extreme, not just that two highly attractive people fall in love through online chatting, but more because they get to know each other in real life at exactly the same time as they are starting to get to know each other online. It's a pretty wild aberration from reality, but on the other hand it allows for a compelling analysis of the different personalities that people assume online and in real life. There is also something to be said about the characterization. Tom Hanks plays on his status as a Hollywood megastar to portray the CEO of a mega bookstore chain, and who better to play the owner of a cute little corner bookstore than Meg Ryan, who is so cute that she could very well represent a 10 on a 1-10 cuteness scale. 10 being the cutest and one being, I don't know, Burt Lancaster or something. I find it a little amusing that the title of the film is from that asinine voice that used to welcome you when you would sign on to the internet back in the mid to late 90s, back when people still used AOL. There is a healthy level of irony included in the movie, as Joe Fox (Hanks) opens one of his massive bookstores around the corner from Kathleen's (Ryan) little shop, and she turns to her online friend, Joe, for help and advice. I appreciate how well they hide their identities, although they have such polarly opposite opinions about commercialism and professional ethics that it seems almost impossible that they should get along so well, especially when Kathleen, at least, is looking for comforting words to help her get through an experience that people like Joe make their living doing to people.I really like that the movie makes such a strong comment about megastores without making them seem evil, or demonizing the people that open and run them. Quite the opposite, in fact. Joe Fox, who is destroying the future of a charming little bookstore that Kathleen inherited from her mother, seems like a perfect fit for the greedy, commercial movie villain, but the whole charm of the movie is that we meet a wealthy businessman with dollar signs in his eyes, and before we know it we're rooting for his happiness. It takes a massive charm, like Hanks', to pull something like that off.While it's sad to see so many small businesses perish under the influence of the homogenized, impersonal super stores, it's also a sad reality of any growing society. Consider, for example, the emotional pain and insignificance that milkmen must have felt when the first supermarkets came along with their refrigerators and their plastic jugs back in the 50s and 60s. The neighborhood lost something of its personality and charm, interpersonal relationships were totally transformed, but now it's hard to imagine an American city without a Safeway or an Albertson's, or even a Piggly Wiggly. I think the really evil stores are ones like Wal Mart, which might be surpassing McDonald's as the worst American company. But the biggest problem with Wal Mart is the greed of the family that owns it. They bleed their employees dry while pocketing astronomical profits, and opening a store in every city imaginable. I live in a small town in central eastern China called Luoyang, and yes, a Wal Mart opened here a few months ago. Unbelievable.But the comment that this movie makes is that, love them or hate them, they are definitely convenient and affordable, and it's even fun to poke around in them. The biggest problem with them is that they are impersonal, you lose that quality of knowing people on a first name basis, and even of having employees who know about what they're selling. There's a scene in this movie where Kathleen wanders into Joe's store and has an experience where we learn that the movie understands this loss of a personal, friendly atmosphere. For all the lack of realism about how Joe and Kathleen meet and the fact that they fall in love, the movie is charming and fun and it's hard to remain indifferent to the happiness of the main characters. They each start the movie with other significant others, but end their respective relationships, leaving them newly single polar opposites looking to each other online for comfort and support. This might be the most obvious set-up I've seen in a movie in some years, so it's a testament to the quality of the movie that it's still a fun ride to the inevitable conclusion",You've Got Mail

This is the 3rd outing of its two leading stars Tom Hanks from Toy Story and Big and Meg Ryan from Anastasia and Kate & Leopold playing the same damsel in distress in every movie she is in,but I do like Meg Ryan since I was a kid so that is why I bought this on DVD as I like Hanks and Ryan. Also they were good in the movie Sleepless In Seattle which I might get on DVD down the line. Anyway back to the film You've Got Mail which is distributed by Warner Bros Pictures in 1998 while they were celebrating 75 years of movie making is a romantic comedy about two business rivals named Joe Fox(Hanks)and Kathleen Kelly(Ryan)who start chatting online together little do they know that they have met in person on several locations. So the two fall in love online little do they know about their bookstores going head to head as he just opened a bookshop across the corner from Kathleen's bookstore which was ran by her mother before she died and since Fox Bookstores is so popular she has to end up closing up her bookstore.But will Kathleen discover that her secret admirer online is in fact Joe and will she be able to have a relationship with him? Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this movie as the chemistry between Meg & Tom was very good and even though its a tad bit predictable you can't help but root for them to get together like in the 1993 film that they both starred in Sleepless in Seattle. Also I love Ryan's haircut in this movie that in the other film that she was in with that awful haircut in Kate & Leopold another romantic comedy that I secretly enjoy watching. Also starring in this movie(You've Got Mail) is Greg Kinnear from The Last Song as Kathleen's stand in love interest and Steve Zahn from Daddy Day Care.

I have to say at this point I have lived next door to several girls,none of whom was remotely like Miss Ryan in any way,shape or form.Indeed one was so unprepossessing that she had to hang a pork chop round her neck before her dog would go out with her (joke,joke).

Spoiler alert, said buddy turns out to be the billionaire owner of said retailer (Hanks), and the two dance around like marionettes with a sliced string or two for the next two hours, narrowly avoiding each other's identities while gnashing teeth and slinging mud in the press. It's an irritating story, filled with irritating people doing irritating things.

36,sauravjoshi85,Predictable yet entertaining movie,7,14 May 2020,You've got Mail is a Romantic Comedy movie directed by Late Nora Ephron and stars Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in the leads.The worst thing that viewers do is comparison. I have read lot many reviews which is based on the comparison with the previous movie but somehow I feel that it is injustice to compare two movies together. There is no doubt and i also agree that people are tend to compare from previous movies but giving negative reviews to an entertaining movie is not good just because it might not be as great as previous movie.This movie is also an entertaining and enjoyable RomCom although the movie is predictable and RomComs are always predictable because it has to end on happy ending. Screenplay is good and music is nice. The screenplay could've been little better. Acting is amazing by the leads.I would again request you to please watch the movie with a fresh mind and I am sure you will enjoy it.,You've Got Mail

It makes me wonder if people do that in real life. I would assume they probably do. To me, that is really romantic. This is because I assume it happens. If you ask me, it's funny how two people who hate each other at the office can unknowingly conduct an Internet romance. This was especially true for Joe (Tom Hanks) and Kathleen (Meg Ryan). If you ask me, this movie had terrific performances, excellent direction, perfect casting, and nice scenery especially for a movie set in New York. Now in conclusion, if you like Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan together in a movie, this is definitely one to see. When you see it, prepare for lots of laughs and romance.

43,triple8,Unending,4,16 August 2003,"If I had to choose my biggest disappointment as far as romantic comedies go it might very well be You've got mail. In fact my being so let down by this movie has even turned into a running joke with my friends. Anyway.... I saw this for several reasons. First I'll see anything that features the superb Mr. Tom Hanks. That was just one of the reasons I made the mistake of seeing this. And also I liked the premise. It's modern and different and sounds like it had the potential to be very interesting. And let's not forget the incredible chemistry between Hansk and Ryan. That alone is reason to tune in to a romantic comedy they star in. So with all those things in it's favor I didn't expect to be so let down. But I was. The movie was very very slow moving. Nothing happens through much of it. Also it seems..well..overlong. Unending. Yes it seemed You've Got Mail would not end. And the Ryan/Hanks chemistry factor? Way down. And the movie's a bit meaner then I would have thought as well.I expected more from this and maybe it's silly but that is primarily because TOM HANKS stars in it. I absolutely love Mr. Hanks and I assume anything he is in is gonna be great. Pretty much everything he does is exceptional.Not this one. Without a doubt You've got mail is the DRAGGIEST movie out there. You'd think, because this is a story of two people falling in love over the internet(which, in my opinion is a GREAT idea for a movie), that this would be really interesting but it's not. Nothing happens. In fact, I don't even know if I saw the very end, if I did I don't remember much about it. Just goes to show even a great performer can occasionally appear in a really bad movie. Or, to be fair, maybe bad isn't the word just long, so very long and nothing seems to HAPPEN through much of it.I did learn that it's wrong to assume a movie's gonna be great just because one happens to love the lead performer.

44,philip_vanderveken,A pleasant surprise,7,1 September 2005,"It's a good thing that I didn't know in advance that so many people compare this movie to ""Sleepless in Seattle"", some even stating that it was some kind of unofficial sequel. I must admit that I didn't like that one all that much and if I had read such comments before watching it, I'm sure I wouldn't even have given it a try, because I'm convinced that there are only few sequels actually worth a watch. But I didn't know all this yet and I was ready to be surprised.Joe Fox and Kathleen Kelly have met each other in a chat box on the internet and have never seen each other, but regularly send each other e-mail messages. On the internet their relationship with each other is close to perfect, but in reality they are each others rivals. Kathleen Kelly is the owner of a little, famous bookstore for children's books who is endangered by the opening of Fox Books, a huge chain of discount book shops. While on the internet madly in love with him, in real life she could drink his blood, not knowing that he's the same person. When Joe Fox finds out the truth, he has to find a way to convince her that he's actually a nice guy...Once again the acting in this movie was very good. I already liked Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan in ""Sleepless in Seattle"", but in my opinion they were even better in this movie. And not only the acting was better, the entire story seemed to work better. The fact that it wasn't so obvious how the story tried to get us emotional, gave this movie that little extra that I'm always looking for. Also the entire idea behind it that people meet in chat rooms is nothing new or exceptional and that they want to see each other in real life afterwards is only natural I believe. It's a part of the modern society and I don't think it will go away soon, so why shouldn't it be used in a romantic movie? Normally I'm not too much a fan of romantic comedies, but this time I'll have to make an exception. I liked the story, the humor was good, the acting more than OK. And the fact that it all was a lot closer to reality than what I could ever hope for in the beginning was a pleasant surprise. That's why I give this movie a 7.5/10.",You've Got Mail

Due to their anonymous identities, each converses with honesty and vulnerability. They are acquainted in their ""real lives,"" but neither is aware of this. Because both parties have adopted defensive exteriors that hide who they really are, they wind up becoming hostile adversaries personally and professionally.Routine rom-com approaches are readily visible, but Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks display so much chemistry, that you're ready to overlook these old plot devices. Example: they open the film each dating a cold, ambitious career-driven person who is obviously wrong for them. Through their interaction over e-mail, the characters change, and their real-life personalities begin to draw together as well. Of course, like any movie of the genre, we gradually progress to a predictable feel-good conclusion.There are two wonderfully sentimental scenes, the first one with Kathleen Kelly (Ryan) in dream sequence reminiscing about her childhood; second, a scene where a golden oldy song from a classic '30's movie punctuates the emotion of the two characters (and conveys their thoughts better than dialog could). The script gives Hanks and Ryan some clever dialog to have some fun with, especially in the latter stages of the movie.If you like the rom-com genre, or the Ryan/Hanks pairing, this movie is a pleasant treat.",You've Got Mail

To begin with, Meg Ryan practically defines cuteness. Even at thirtysomething she is cute enough to fawn over, bless her heart; and Jean Stapleton as her bookkeeper and her mother's bookkeeper-adorable. The clever old gal even bought Intel at six-just adorable! And can Tom Hanks ever handle this? Play a male lead with property and money and a bad dye job? Piece of cake. I mean, just behave and you are plenty eligible and totally adorable yourself. Throw in a dog and some cute kids and a fairy tale New York, and what have you got? You've got corn syrup! That's what you've got. My lord, even Dabney Coleman is cute in this! (And don't you just love the way his bad dye job mustache matches Hanks' bad dye job hairdo?)This is a diabolical, cynical seduction of sappy-hearted lovers everywhere. Indulge. This is femme porn. Bring a box of Kleenex (actually the Ephrons anticipated this and put a few on screen, bless their hearts) and some bon-bons. Know that the female lead will find true love, money and life-long security simultaneously after going through some real fun misdirections en route. Muggers in New York? AIDS? Cockroaches? Crack cocaine? Summer swelters? Dirty snow? Garbage strikes? Smelly, polluted Hudson? Odoriferous poverty? I mean, get real! Even the two roommates that our lovers dump are going to live happily ever after. Do we experience heartaches? Does love bite? Diss off! This is the yellow brick road in Olde New York, and it feels just like mainlining heroin.Best line: As Hanks reveals himself to Meg he uses her email handle and says, ""Don't cry, Shopgirl"" while the sound track prompts our tears with ""Somewhere over the Rainbow."" I mean, this is a BIG HANKY kind of movie!In summation, the ""cute"" speed limit was greatly exceeded in this Pollyannish feel-gooder, and I am imposing the following fine on Director Nora Ephron: 200 hours of community service in the ladies powder room of the Bronx welfare office, and a promise never to do anything like this again, no matter how great the temptation.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

As it happens, Meg Ryan's bookstore is utterly destroyed by Hanks chain, and has to fold up. Yet, when at the end, she learns of his identity, she stills agrees to go out with him! Is she a masochist or something?. This pretends to be a romantic comedy but, believe me, you leave this movie with a very bad taste on your mouth.

50,jhclues,Ryan And Hanks Light Up The Screen,10,24 July 2000,"To those who are wont to put forth the proposition that `They don't make em like they used to,' I have a rejoinder:  The two best romantic comedies ever made, EVER, have come our way since 1998; one of them is `You've Got Mail,' an absolute delight of a movie directed with heart-felt care and finesse by Nora Ephron.  It's the story of two people who meet in a chat room on the Internet; Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) is the owner of a chain of bookstores, and Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) is the owner of a small, independent children's book store called `The Shop Around The Corner,' whose continued existence is threatened by the  Fox superstore which offers discounts and cappuccino.  Harsh competitors in the real world, they are able to connect with one another via the net only because of the anonymity provided by cyberspace, where neither has a clue as to whom the other really is. 	The charismatic Hanks delves beneath the businessman veneer of Fox to give him some real humanity; he's tough in the trenches of commerce, but he makes it clear that this is a guy whose interests range beyond the bottom line. Hanks lends a natural, self-assurance and charm that makes Fox a complete character, and one you can't help but like.  And Meg Ryan has never been better than she is here as Kathleen Kelly, a role she was born to play.  As soon as you meet her, you feel as though you've known her a long time; she is so open, wears her heart on her sleeve and has a vulnerability and benevolence to her nature that make her totally endearing.  Ryan imbues her with a joy and warmth that is almost tangible, and she plays her with nuance that is distinctly drawn and which makes her unique from any character she's ever done before.  There's a real chemistry between her and Hanks, and Ryan utterly lights up the screen with her winsomeness. 	There's a terrific supporting cast on hand here as well, which includes Greg Kinnear (Frank), Parker Posey (Patricia), Heather Burns (Christina), Steve Zahn (George) , Jean Stapleton (Birdie), David Chappelle (Kevin), Dabney Coleman (Nelson Fox) and John Randolph (Schuyler Fox).  This is a great story, with outstanding performances by all, the dialogue is crisp and witty, and it's all put together and delivered so well, and with such style and class by Ephron that it makes `Sleepless In Seattle,' (an excellent movie in it's own right) seem like a mere warm-up for this team.  The music, with the choice of songs and the specific scenes into which they are inserted, is just another reason this film works so well.  The musical interludes, which set Hanks and Ryan at different stages of their relationship against the backdrop of New York City, are entirely effective; the city comes alive during these scenes and adds further character to the overall ambience of the movie.  `You've Got Mail' is quite simply the second best romantic comedy ever made, and it should have walked away with a basketful of Oscars, especially for Meg Ryan's performance.  And anyone who comes away from this one thinking differently is jaded and needs some serious help (and I say that with a smile, folks), because this is one terrific movie that must not be missed.  If there's any romance in your soul at all, you're going to love this one.  I rate this one 10/10.",You've Got Mail

The Hanks-Ryan duo made three movies together, three then five years apart; the second, ""Sleepless in Seattle"" grossed ten times its production cost, which, inevitably and thankfully, meant they would do ""You've Got Mail"".

The cast included other supporting actors who have been leads themselves, like Dabney Coleman, John Randolph, Jean Stapleton, Greg Kinnear, Steve Zahn and Parker Posey; Dave Chapelle's performance, in this film, also helped his career by displaying the talent some of us are familiar with now. Personally, I discovered the songs of Harry Nilsson thanks to this movie, which prominently featured compositions as well as his own renditions of many of them; the soundtrack is one of only a dozen I bothered to get and still listen to at times.

Then we got a musical version of the same story in '49 with Judy Garland and Van Johnson called IN THE GOOD OLD SUMMERTIME.

They both start out as rivals in the beginning of the movie but unknown to themselves they've been anonymously communicating with each other via instant messaging. And even though they act like they hate each other you just know by the end of the movie they'll end up with each other, that's how movies like this always work.",You've Got Mail

Tom who plays Joe Fox and Meg who plays Kathleen Kelly are amazing as usual and of course they have great chemistry in the movie.  With an added extra good performance from Greg Kinnear who plays Frank Navasky, Kathleen's boyfriend. Kathleen Kelly owns a little bookshop called ""Shop around the corner"", it's been opened for years and used to be owned by her late mother. Everyone loves her shop, until a new bookstore opens up in the same street, called: Fox Bookstores owned by Joe Fox, which leaves Kathleen's business in danger and forces her to close down her store.Kathleen and Joe both despise each-other, but little do they know they talk to each-other every night on the internet and have a great relationship online. The ending in the movie is predictable, but lovely. I give You've Got Mail a 10/10.",You've Got Mail

You've Got Mail! :) Big effing deal...You've also got a lying, shallow, egocentric, conniving character who is haunting you around but not telling you who he is and then closes up your business, still playing with your head.Ohhh...this film is bad. There is something so wrong with this movie on so many levels that I can't state.Maybe it's the corporate glamorizing. Maybe it's the ever sappy Meg Ryan and how she just can't slap somebody across the face with any real merit or determination. Maybe it's Tom Hanks and his ever smug niceness, which is really blinding us from seeing his real evil.Whatever is wrong, I don't know...this movie is just not right. Just as Pretty Woman - there is only pretty faces covering a story of something cruel and heartless and disturbing. However, we don't see it because of the pretty Meg Ryan and her perkiness smile.Another story - overdone by the media to hide the real truths about the evil corporations...the evil suits on Wall Street dn the clones they have turned our cities and towns into.",You've Got Mail

This, however, is too damn long and too damn cloying.  I did like some scenes, but most of it stunk.

72,chrisbrown6453,I'd have to say You've Got Mail was a fun romantic comedy.,6,19 June 2002,"Now you're saying, wow, it must have taken a long time for you to come up with that. Well it didn't. I had just finished final exams for the semester and my brain was a little fried. But come on, when you have Hanks, Ryan and Ephron together, what do you expect? World War III? Of course it was going to be fun and romantic. Hanks and Ryan have to be the premiere on-screen couple in Hollywood. And Ephron has proven over the years that she can get both a tear and a smile out of you during her movies. Hanks plays Joe Fox, the son of the owner of the largest book chain in New York, Fox Books. Ryan plays Kathleen Kelly, the owner of a small children's bookstore called, A Shop Around the Corner. Well as it turns out, Fox Books opens up a store right around the corner from Kathleen's store. Joe and Kathleen run into each other, and its hate at first site. Kathleen thinks Joe is just a money hungry businessman, while Joe just thinks Kathleen is another stepping stone in life. And they're both happy to go on thinking that way about each other. What they don't realize is that they know each other. See, both Kathleen and Joe are having an email relationship online. Every day they email back and forth, saying things most people only dream about, but never saying anything personal. Joe and Kathleen have the dream relationship with each other; they just don't know it yet.
So you know where the movie goes. They love each other online, and hate each other offline. When Joe finds out that his online love is Kathleen, he's not sure what to do. Does he tell her? Or does he try and find out how she really feels about him? My only problem with the film was her reaction at the end when they finally meet. It seems to be that in a way he was lying to her about who he was. He knew who she was, and he sort of used that to find out about how she felt about him. I don't know about you, but I think I might have been a little more upset about being used that way. But then again, we were at the 2 hour mark when they met, so I guess it had to have a happy ending. And I'm not saying the happy ending was bad, just Hollywood.

75,roghache,"Entertaining on line romance, but with messages & flaws",6,27 March 2006,"This is apparently somewhat a remake of the old 1940 film, Little Shop Around the Corner, updated to the computer age. Having not seen the original, I cannot compare though found this a breezy enough, entertaining little comedy romance. The stars, Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, are as usual wonderful here, though for me, this venture didn't measure up to their earlier Sleepless in Seattle.It's a story that contrasts real life with the cyber world. Kathleen Kelly, the present owner of her late mother's little Manhattan children's bookshop, is having an affair but meanwhile corresponding on line with another man. Her e-mailing pen pal turns out to be (though unknown to her) none other than Joe Fox, the rather greedy, selfish son of the owner of a gigantic bookstore chain, Fox Books, which is moving into Kathleen's neighbourhood and putting her little family bookshop out of business. The pair are thus business rivals in the real world, but fall in love through their Internet correspondence. Joe eventually discovers the identity of Shopgirl (Kathleen) but not vice versa, so he sets out to befriend his pen pal in person.Not that this is intended as anything other than a cute little comedy romance, but the movie does have a couple of relevant messages. First, you never really know who's at the other end of cyber correspondence, so, as we're told to warn our kids, beware of who you might be revealing your life story and innermost thoughts to! Kathleen's on line pen pal is (apparently) quite a different person than the real life Joe Fox, and Kathleen of course has absolutely no idea as to whom she is pouring out her heart in these e-mails. Here, however, the point being made is that yes, the two really are one and the same person. Joe is simply revealing his more caring, sensitive side that doesn't normally show in his somewhat ruthless business dealings. He is not a one-dimensional, remorseless villain, thus making him actually quite a believable, realistic character.The other issue addressed is the extremely common tragedy in modern society of mega chain stores (with their huge stock and cheap prices) forcing closure of small family shops with their more personal service, cozy atmosphere, and limited but often more unique merchandise. Sadly, this happens in real life all the time.Of course there's a happy ending for this couple, but is it? Personally, I question whether or not Joe is really that right for Kathleen if, knowing how much her mother's shop means to her, he can still continue with the corporate dealings that force its closure, or how happy Kathleen will be longterm, realizing what her man has done. True, her employees will not be jobless but given positions with the new Fox superstore. However, it definitely won't be the same as the personal interactions they've been accustomed to with their former employer or the genuine interest these loyal folk have had in the success of Kathleen's little bookshop.All this being said regarding any deep meaning and the disappointing aspects of its ending, it is for the most part a pleasant, light hearted bit of fluff. These two stars are great on screen together and make for an entertaining little romance.",You've Got Mail

The story brought together the stars who were like 'debuts' to the screen where in the later decades digital universe with the internet has produced plural movies. 
Achievement to credit to these two actors and their director is that the crew came together in this movie with lights and space giving time and energy to put the story through processing after shooting and through the final cutting done by the director before the feature film is released. 
The television broadcast of 'You've Got Mail' had been in the month of July two thousand and eighteen with a suitable romantic visual brocade to broadcast in the television channel at the time. The show that aired as 'You've Got Mail' achieved the expected effect of capturing attention from the other programs who were playing movies simultaneously. 
The review proofs that even with commercial breaks; like watching movies in cinema halls their was comfort in knowing that eyes watching television programs could be subject to harm like wearing spectacles which we have. Spectacles are objects that give us vision that is like the average eyesight with no spectacles needed to see both far and near distances. 
Take care to write and read but do not be 'glued' to digital revolution. We were from television sets here in the third world but now the odd movie that catches our attention.

These loose ends seem to have been put there deliberately, Hitchcock-style, to circumvent the curse of the genre - its utter predictability.

83,MarioB,Just a another remake,2,5 January 2000,"I had two big problems with this movie. The first one is that all romantic comedies of the 1980's and 1990's seems to duplicate each other. Always the same thing! Always oldies music in it! No surprise! So are the most of the movies with Meg Ryan and Julia Roberts. It's got no originality. Thesecond problem is that I hate remakes! And 1940's The Shop Around the Corner was one of my favorite romantic comedy of all time, because the great Ernst Lubitch directs it and young James Stewart was in it. The 1940 version is full of charm! There was a musical remake, in 1949, In the Good Old Summertime, featuring Judy Garland. And it was badder! Now here comes the 1998 version, with Meg Ryan, with oldies music in it. The idea of Nora Ephron was not so bad. It had differences with the original. In the 1940's, the man and the woman works at the same place. And, of course, they don't write e-mails! I also like the idea of the battle between big surface book store and the little shop with humanity. And I was ANGRY, real ANGRY when Meg closes his store, because of these stupid big stores! But a lot of scenes between Ryan and Hanks are similar to the ones between James Stewart and Margarett Sullivan. Looking at those scenes, I was always thinking about Stewart. At that point, it don't work with me. But, this version is not so bad. It's just not great and shows little imagination and creativity, one particular of most of the American movies of the 1990's (remakes, adaptations of sixties TV works, catastrophic versions of French Films, special effects films, etc.)  For the emotions of the finale, see the 1940 version.

84,Jerique,You've Got Mail - Review,9,10 August 2007,"Rating: 9/10When you look back on this film, you can't help remembering these two in Sleepless In Seattle.Tom Hank's Joe Fox role is completely overshadowed by his Award-Winning performance of Captain Miller in Saving Private Ryan in the same year.However, lets not overlook his performance here. Tom Hanks is one of those versatile actors, not only can he go from a dramatic role in Saving Private Ryan to a romantic role in You've Got Mail, but he can do comedy too.Meg Ryan, the Queen of Romance, stars alongside Tom Hanks. The chemistry between the two in the movie, you'll swear they are married in real life.The writing and directing by Nora Ephron is tremendous once again. Here's a woman who can superbly write men while still knowing how to write the perfect woman.It's great to see not only a predictable movie like this play out so well, but have also a large supporting cast to boot. Steve Zahn, Greg Kinnear, Jean Stapleton, Parker Posey, and Dave Chappelle provide the comedic relief when Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks are lost in each other's constant back and forth emailing.When you finally finish the movie, you'll feel warm, and satisfied. As if you just experienced all the love between them with the special someone you have or met.This is definitely a movie you will not want to pass up.

""You've Got Mail"" slowly builds and allows the audience to start wishing more and more that the main characters could be together. Some romantic comedies jump around too much and make it unbelievable that the guy and girl would fall in love. However, in this film, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan start out as competitors who hate each other, unaware that they are corresponding to each other's emails and are slowly falling in love. Tom Hanks learns the truth first and plays with Meg Ryan for awhile, causing her to wish it was him she was falling in love with, unaware of the truth. The end proves to be tear-jerking and entirely romantic. The music mixes well with the romance in the film as well. Hanks and Ryan do a good job in this film, and so does the supporting cast, including Parker Posey and Dabney Coleman. The film left me satisfied and happy.

The screenplay and director is absolutely horrible. The director must be old fashioned because they play trashy 50s music in the wrong scenario and scenes all the time. I mean every other scene is a little montage with 50s music.. even during talking scenes theres wrongly placed music, it's just amateur.

92,kergillian,Sappy romance with overlooked potential to be charming.,5,17 March 2001,"Nora Ephron shamelessly rehashes her other popular sap-fest, Sleepless in Seattle, which in turn was a shameless rehash of the great neo-classic When Harry Met Sally.Two quick points:a) Tom Hanks is one of the most overrated actors in Hollywoodb) Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks repeatedly team up for hopelessly saccharine romances that never seem to work, mainly because of Hanks' complete lack of appeal.Fact: I have rarely seen a Hanks film I liked. Splash, Bachelor Party, Philadelphia, Sleepless in Seattle, Cast Away to name a few. And those are just the decent ones; he's made a deluge of absolutely horrid films as well (can you say Joe Versus the Volcano? Turner and Hooch? Forrest Gump??). Here he's as unappealing as ever.So why do his movies make so much money? Simple: the average movie-goer sees someone as useless as Hanks getting into Meg Ryan's bed and they figure 'if he can do it *anyone* can!' This film has few saving graces. Meg Ryan plays herself. She's hardly the world's greatest actress (and she'll never top her performances in When Harry Met Sally and Hurly Burly) but her smile could melt steel and her charisma carries her a long way. Also, three strong co-star performances helped to ease the pain of the rest of the poor acting. Always fabulous Jean Stapleton steals the show here; charming, elegant, well- spoken...she's simply a pleasure to watch. Indie-queen Parker Posey (who happens to be one of my fav actresses) also gives a great, though under-cut, performance. Steve Zahn is really amusing in his role as Ryan's slightly spaced-out employee. (Why Posey and Zahn decided to follow-up Suburbia with this film I'll never know...) And finally, the always amusing Dave Chappelle gave another solid performance and outshined Hanks in each of their scenes together.All in all, the supporting cast helped to make this film watchable, and some of the dialogue was quite clever.

Neither knows who the other is, and when they initially meet in real life (not knowing of their internet personas), they dislike each other.

95,el7,Ironic in Hindsight,6,29 November 2019,"You've Got Mail represents the tail end of the golden era of romantic comedies, during which writers and directors were trying to get an angle that would work for a more cynical movie-going public. Nora Ephron, with her rapier wit which she often hid within a cinematographic soft glove, was one of the more successful filmmakers of the later period. This film is a remake of The Shop Around the Corner from an earlier rom com era, so there are layers to the references in this movie, and if you catch them all, some of them are quite ironic. Especially the unintended ones, though. The script updates the story of the big retailer putting the small retailer out of business even as the two proprietors fall in love by recasting the retail stores as bookstores (this was actually a very big deal in the 90s) and the pen pals are corresponding via email rather than snail mail this time around. Looking at this film all these years later, you can't help but marvel at the fact that the filmmakers had written a romance about a big box bookseller winning the girl by utilizing a tool that was destined to put him out of business one day. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan both have a great deal of personal charm individually and solid chemistry together, so the movie works on that level. Some aspects of the film aged less well than others. For example, the opening scenes that show Hanks and Ryan seeing their lovers off to start their days, and then sneaking back to their laptops to emote at each other via email, are played as cute hijinks, when today their actions would be recognized as an emotional affair. It's immediately clear that neither one is involved with a suitable lover, and then those lovers very conveniently (and somewhat ironically) develop a connection with each other, but still. This movie is somewhat of a time capsule, and still worth a watch with that in mind. Hanks and Ryan do a better job of selling the idea that these two can overcome his rampant trampling on her livelihood through their personal connection to each other much more successfully than the script manages to do.",You've Got Mail

To this add for spice one of the queens of INDy film and for nostalgia Edith Bunker; mix well. Throw in a huge dose of Republican conservative nonapologetic conformist tripe disguised as the good guys vs. the bad guys. Bake for 1 hour plus occasionally sprinkling over 60s liberal ideas and 90s wealth at any cost philosophies. Out will come a new millennium cake pallatable for the masses that says the rich aren't evil, being poor is evil and when you lose your business it is so you can write the next best seller and be on Oprah and join those rich happy people who God loves most and gives more to because they deserve it! How in just half a century did a story about clerical basals living in boarding houses and struggling to meet another human being with similar interests become the story of a superstore who is the new Shop Around the Corner you needn't fear? The sad fact is we are left in this version feeling the liberal individual was better for being homogenized into the larger aggressive hoardes swelling Wall Street. This is what the bankers wanted to say, after all, and Mr. Hanks and Ms. Ryan were the willing puppets for their shadow play. Or, perhaps Mr. Hanks really wants to be feeling and genuine and Ms. Ryan would love to have brass balls beneath her kilted skirt that swung out so far it could smash the men who got in her way? You choose. Either way, I smell a rat! It is of interest that since this movie came out: America has been kneecapped by the MidEast with a weak dollar and shrinking middle class (if any);we have a 1-party system parading as 2; and we are a very disturbed culture based on violence greed and celebrity.

The writing is good (not great) and there are good supporting performances by Parker Posey, Greg Kinnear and Dabney Coleman. The plot is so predictable that you can just about call each scene before it happens. However, glowing performances by Hanks and Ryan make this a film worth seeing. A better film than ""Sleepless in Seattle"", because its light-heartedness is not burdened down with death and missing children.NOTE to fans of ""The Godfather"" - this film is a must-see to hear Hanks explain how the Godfather has the answers to all of life's questions.

Nora and Delia Ephron's script succeeds because they know their characters well, and give them a can't miss plot device.  Tom Hanks is believable as the head of a gigantic bookstore chain, as is Meg Ryan as the owner of a small children's bookstore shop.  As the guy who is putting Meg out of business by opening a chain store close to her little shop, Tom Hanks character comes across as the arrogant person who only goal seems to open as many bookstores as he can, and make as much money as he can in doing so. When he is talking to Meg Ryan on the internet, we see another side of him, and learn that possibly, he's not the evil guy you think he is.  Of course, in person, Meg hates him for what he is doing, on the internet, she falls in love with him.  This is what makes the film work, as their reaction to each other in person is completely different from when they talk on line.  Some people may quibble that the ending is not very believable, but face it, do you fall in love with a person because of who they are, or what you think they are?

104,InaneSwine,"Mostly entertaining, but unfortunately weakened by implausibility",6,22 December 2012,"I have never seen Joe Versus the Volcano, nor have I seen Sleepless In Seattle. So this is the first and thus far the only time I have seen Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan act together. From what I've read, it seems that those other two films received mostly positive reviews, especially the latter, and I did get the sense that You've Got Mail was an attempt at capitalising on the success of those films.On the surface, the film is a typical romantic comedy, based on the premise that two business enemies begin anonymously chatting to each other online, and fall in love with each other's nameless identities through the internet. For me, this was the least interesting part of the film. What interested me more was its exploration of the business world, and the moral grey area of huge business chains and franchises sweeping through society, forcing the closure of smaller, family-run businesses that haven't a snowball's chance in hell of competing.Nonetheless, it is clear that this was not the main point that the filmmakers were trying to show, and what results is a slow romantic comedy, and the romance that ever-so-slowly blossoms between Hanks and Ryan feels all the more forced. Hanks gives a typically great performance, and Ryan isn't too shabby either. It's a shame that they are surrounded by a chorus of one-dimensional characters who really offer nothing of true value to the story, and the plot itself is strained to the point of implausibility. But for most of its runtime, it will keep you entertained.",You've Got Mail

106,BB-15,A Romantic Comedy that Goes Sour,3,31 May 1999,"I like romantic comedies and this one had a promising start. The feel of New York during the holidays felt cozy. The characters started out in the usual way in this type of film and felt like an old glove, very comfortable. There is the typical series of coincidences, embarrassing missteps and chance encounters as the romance unfolds. You've Got Mail is well made and acted and was very enjoyable for a while until it went very wrong.At the mid point of these kinds of films there is often a serious sometimes even tragic moment. But it is always a personal tragedy. In You've Got Mail the heavy story involves big business vs. small business. It then slides into lobbying, media manipulation, community activism and preserving old neighborhoods. Yikes! It felt like 60 Minutes.After all this I was waiting for someone in the film to file a lawsuit and a possible courtroom drama. This was no longer a story of romance for me. But the most incredible, grotesque thing is that the victim, the sympathetic character, the person whose life long dream is crushed is somehow made to live ""happily ever after"" with the eventual villain of the story. Such a thing would not only not happen in real life but would not occur in a romance. It is more appropriate to the cold plot twists in a film such as The Player.After several weeks since seeing You've Got Mail and giving it some thought, I am still amazed that such a confused script with its ridiculous ending was made into a film.",You've Got Mail

108,Captain Ed,"Romantic and accessible, funny and smart",8,12 June 2000,"Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are at their best in this gentle comedy about love and business war (and all's fair in either).  A remake of ""The Shop Around the Corner"" and ""In The Good Old Summertime"", it has been updated by Nora Ephron for the digital age and the transition is well done.  They are helped by a good supporting cast, including a classy turn by Jean Stapleton (the love of her life is one of the funniest parts of the movie).  Dabney Coleman and John Randolph are endearing as Hank's father and grandfather, both of whom are as unlucky at love as Hanks.  Parker Posey is excellent as his self-involved girlfriend.Hanks and Ryan are perfectly cast.  Ryan is playful and charming, yet quirky and passionate enough to differentiate this character from some of her other films.  Hanks is understated as usual, and risks being more than a tad unpleasant in a few scenes with Ryan.  Some people will complain that they've seen this type of story before. Well, it IS a remake of a story that's been filmed twice before.  Some will complain that everyone knows they'll end up together.  Well, it IS a romantic comedy.  The characterizations are good, the dialogue is smart, and the music is well done.  **POSSIBLE SPOILER:** The ending is just a shade too pat -- I would have expected more of a conflict at the last reveal, but my wife thought it was just perfect the way it was, so what the heck do I know anyway?How can you go wrong with all of that and Hanks and Ryan?

The story was rather stilted and the more boring it became, the higher they cranked up the music.

111,darius_sutherland,Enjoyed It Even If Stalkery,5,31 December 2019,I enjoyed this movie when I first saw it and I still like it now. It's not the best movie in the world but I like it.On repeat viewing there is a very dark undertone if you think about it. Tom Hanks is a horrible stalker and this movie should be a horror story.If you can get past that then an enjoyable schmaltzy rom-com that you can forget about after viewing.,You've Got Mail
112,Gambitt,More of the same; not as original this time around,5,29 December 2002,"This cute little romance features Meg Ryan and flavor-of-the-month.  In general ""You've Got Mail"" is warm, amusing, and cuddly.  Would we expect anything else from Ryan?The acting is good enough, though honestly Ryan should be able to do this kind of movie in her sleep by now.  Likewise, Tom Hanks just acts like his funny, lovable self and it works.  Parker Posey deserves a shout-out for her role as the selfish, materialistic yuppie.  I admire her for her willingness to repeatedly play negative characters.The plot and characters are somewhat cliche, but I'll admit that there were some nice, funny lines (""Soon it will be something really depressing. Like a 'Baby Gap'"").Unfortunately, the last quarter of the movie ruined it for me.
**SPOILERS AHEAD**In short, the ending wrapped everything up a little too cleanly.  I understand that there was supposed to be a certain time transition (and perhaps the film makers failed to convey this transition), but Maggie overcame her hatred of Joe quite quickly.  One second she is determined to beat this sinister, heartless, corporate jackal; the next second she calmly invites him into her house, talks with him, and suddenly starts going on strolls with him to the market and discussing her personal life with him.Yes, we expect these sudden turns in a Hollywood romance and it's true that Maggie's character is supposed to be especially forgiving, but in this case it simply undermines the depth of her character.  Just before Maggie and Joe began their tentative flirtation, the movie had culminated in the closing of her store, an emotional blow to herself and her doomed quest.  She then gives in to Joe so easily that it almost makes her seem fickle, or that perhaps the store (that her mother had started, and had warmed so many childrens' hearts, and was such a wonderful small business) really hadn't mattered to her very much afterall, that she had already forgotten about it. And I actually thought that the filmmakers did a rather GOOD job of portraying how devastated Maggie was after the closure.  I'm not saying the PLOT was outright bad; I'm saying the pacing and transitions need work.I guess I'm more cynical than the movie makers.  I find it hard to believe that a small mom-and-pop bookshop could even survive for 42 years in downtown New York.  Furthermore I don't believe that a man as caring and conscientious as Joe could be a success in the corporate world.  Sure I know that Joe's character was moved to CHANGE himself throughout the movie, but even early on, such as the scenes with the kids, he is shown as a kind-hearted, fun-loving man.  To me this characterization just seems inconsistent with his role as a top corporate officer.  I suppose a lot of this overanalysis is very subjective and depends on one's attitude towards big business, but hey, I'm just pointing out what seemed odd to me.On another note, why is breaking-up always so easy to do in movies?  Half the break-ups end with ""well, I don't love you either, so this is perfect!"" As long as the protagonist is the one doing the breaking up in order to be with the co-star, it's okay and no one gets hurt.  Filmmakers always seem to conveniently avoid the issue of an expendable character being devastated by a break-up (...although I recently saw ""Addicted to Love,"" which explores exactly that issue, and ironically features Ryan again).  I'm just ranting about this because there are about 43 instant, guiltfree breakups in this movie.** END SPOILERS **Finally, I just can't stand AOL, and couldn't get over the feeling that the movie was a huge advertisement for AOL.  Sure, I know the brandname ""AOL"" was never explicitly mentioned, but everyone and everyone's mom knows that the featured e-mail sounds mean ""AOL"" by now.  Interestly enough, the network showing I saw featured commercials from both AOL AND rival Netzero.Mind you, I'm not saying ""You've Got Mail"" was an AWFUL movie.  I'm just saying that it was amusing and worth watching but overall flawed, fairly average, and unremarkable.",You've Got Mail
113,michaelgarykelley1994,Decent Flick,6,8 October 2019,"My fiancé loves this movie, and she wanted me to watch it, since we had run out of Hallmark-y Christmas flicks to watch, on amazon. I was a bit reluctant, at first, but as soon as I realized Tom Hanks was the main character, I was all-in. Love that guy. Dave Chappelle, Steve Zahn, and many other folk are involved with the flick, too, which made it even more interesting, for me, since I love those folks just as much as Hanks.I'm obsessed with bookstores, and reading. The film is focused primarily on that, with Hanks' enormous Barnes and Noble-type of store trying to deplatform Meg Ryan's small, homely children's bookstore (which had a display of Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark, I might add). But they both have been talking to each other over the internet without even knowing it, even throughout their spat.It was cute, and Hanks is always fun to watch. The guy really pulls the comedy off well, here. Ryan was pretty and sweet. The ending was touching, like most romcoms.That's all it has to offer, and that's all it really needed, for the audience it's going for.

114,sbox,Solid Writing Produces Good Movie.,6,21 August 1999,"[WARNING:  A review cannot be written without spoilers.  You have been warned.]I really wanted to dislike this film.  However, in the end I couldn't.I was frequently annoyed at Meg Ryan's theatrical mannerisms.  Moreover, I resented the Manhattan snobbery abundant in the film  and which was best evidenced by Ryan's female clerk who espoused the following,  ""If you close, I'll lose my job and have to move to Brooklyn.""  Gee, life is hard in the real world isn't it?  She may have well admitted she didn't want to live amongst the working class, or dare I say it, ""minorities.""  This goes to show that some of those who live at the very center of the most metropolitan of cities can be bigger, small town hicks, than the residents of Andy's fictional Mayberry.However, by the graces of outstanding writing, which avoided the all too convenient escape route of predictable happy endings, the small shop did indeed close, under commercial pressure.  Miraculously, life did not end for the unlucky workers of the small shop.  In fact, they went on to other things, as in real life.  Of course the film doesn't follow every one of them post closure, but we are given enough assurance through the actions of the lead, Ryan.Another surprise of the film is how it expertly avoided relying too much on its gimmicky title.  The internet aspect of the romance was not a crutch. Real interaction amongst interesting characters avoided the trap.This is like an old time love story.  It drags a bit at times, but overall comes off as a refreshing piece.",You've Got Mail
115,krumski,"An odd, distasteful little movie",4,12 May 2000,"This movie is strange. Just weird. It would seem as if it's trying to be a romantic comedy, and indeed that is what it was billed and sold as (And it's based on one of the best - the 1938 film The Shop Around the Corner, starring Jimmy Stewart and Margaret Sullavan.  People, this is an absolute gem, and regardless of how you feel about You've Got Mail, you ABSOLUTELY must see it. See it! See it! See it! You won't be disappointed.)But back to You've Got Mail. Now, I like Tom Hanks. I like Meg Ryan. I loved them together in Joe Versus the Volcano (haven't seen Sleepless in Seattle - and have no intention of ever doing so). But they completely fizzle here. It's not really their fault. The script is so hard-wired to prevent any audience sympathy or interaction. The premise would appear to be golden: two people fall in love with one another via the Internet, only to realize that in real life they can't stand each other. This is an intriguing set-up (and a savvy and intelligent update of Shop Around the Corner's pen-pal conceit); the scenes where we hear (through voiceover) Tom and Meg's communiques with each other are low-key and sweet. But. . . oh, there are so many ""but""s - such as:*Did the script really need to pair up the stars with respective live-ins (Greg Kinnear for her, Parker Posey for him)? These characters never get explored in the least, are blatant caricatures (he of N.Y. intelligentsia, she of the brash and crass world of publishing), and are dispensed of without any noticeable fanfare. What's the point? Surely, having the leads be separated by not knowing each others' identities should have been (and is) complication enough.*Why is Hanks' character privy to the secret identity of his e-mail partner so long before Ryan's is? True, this development corresponds structurally to the one played out in Shop Around the Corner, but that's not really a fair comparison. There, the entire movie was more or less seen through the eyes of Jimmy Stewart's character, and our identification with him made us wonder how he would make use of his knowledge. Here, though, Hanks and Ryan are given equal weight and screen time; neither represents the definitive ""perspective"" through which the film is to be seen. As such, awarding his character knowledge which she does not possess strikes of a desire to play favorites - and wreaks havoc with the trajectory of the movie's second half. It suddenly ceases being a movie about equals and becomes more about the deliberate manipulations and evasions of Tom Hanks' character - making the whole thing seem insincere and smarmy, rather than fun or heart-warming.*And speaking of smarmy, what's with the moral of this story? Is there one?! I mean sure, going in, we more or less figure that there will be a sappy but endearing message about love winning out in the end over personal differences. Which we're prepared for (and frankly, if you're not, you've stepped into not only the wrong movie but the wrong genre). Since, in the film, Hanks and Ryan are the heads of rival bookstores - he a large and impersonal chain, she a small, independently owned neighborhood store catering lovingly to children - we get to see their personal peccadillos played out in the world of business. This is a good idea, particularly as his chain is attempting to drive hers out of business. Problem is, no one really had the heart to make Tom Hanks the yuppie s.o.b. he really needed to be for this story to work (of course, the Hanks of the '80s was born to play just this role - but now that he's graduated to bland ""nice guy"" parts I suppose all nuance and complexity have gone out of his work). What the filmmakers do instead is truly laughable (and here comes a major SPOILER, so if you don't want to know how this film ends stop reading here) - they have Hanks' company run Ryan's out of business - and then have her fall in love with him anyway. HUH?! Could someone explain that to me? The two don't reach a détente, a middle ground, in their personal and business bickering. They don't join forces, or find some compromise way to co-exist. I was at least expecting some diatribe against big business in favor of small and independent shopowners who truly ""care"" about their product. Corny though it might have been, it at least would have been consistent with the genre it found itself in. Or the movie might have been truly brave and suggested that, under the circumstances, there was no way Ryan could ever be with Hanks, as much as she loves him in cyberspace, for their fundamental difference in temperament and philosophy would always keep them apart. Then, maybe, Tom would have to undergo some kind of transformation or catharsis or. . . . but, hey, since he's already such a nice guy in this movie, screw it, let's just have him win heartlessly in business, and get the girl anyway. Under all the gossamer and syrup of the ending, it's a pretty mean-spirited and cynical message this movie is pushing. Very distasteful, too.

It is reminiscent of movies made in the 30s and 40s. In fact, it is a remake of the 1940 classic, The Shop Around the Corner.You find yourself rooting for the hero and heroine to get together and live happily ever after. What is a little hard to believe is the fact that two total strangers communicating over the internet are actually living in the same city, in the same neighborhood much less the same country. Figure the odds on this happening in real life.All this aside this is a pleasant movie. Stars Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan make the characters real and sympathetic. Hanks has never given a bad performance and how can you not fall in love with Ryan. This is essentially a two-character movie with the supporting cast merely going through the motions. It was nice though, to see Jean Stapleton in the role of Birdie, even though she too had little to do.It's still hard for me to believe that the Ryan character would fall in love with the Hanks character, given that he has just run her out of business, however this is Hollywood where the impossible and unlikely happen every day.You've Got Mail is still an enjoyable movie despite all of its apparent faults.",You've Got Mail
119,alexcomputerkid,You've Got Mail is still very much revolutionary while still sappy. It is one of the few tech love stories that men could really enjoy.,7,16 February 2014,"It's hard to believe but there was once a time in the dating world where the use of technology didn't have the impact that is does today. With Facebook, Twitter, dating sites and advancements in phone technology, there are now so many ways to connect or make contact with a person where as before you really only had a home telephone or even letters. You've Got Mail was a 1998 romantic comedy that introduced new technology to the dating world and in a very cheesy way. Small time book owner Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) is living in the Big Apple and must compete with the opening of the new Fox Books run by the high profile Joe Fox (Tom Hanks). As it turns out, both of these business-owners are instant-messaging each other without realizing who the other is and a love relationship forms.If anything, this seems very much like a typical relationship film. It is a love story that starts with people not connecting, being enemies and both doing opposite type of things. Even though these ideas are very dated now (when that last time you heard of anyone using AOL?), the instant- messaging is what makes this story. At the time, instant- messaging was somewhat new and I believe AOL may have been using the movie as a marketing idea. The idea that these people are messaging each other without realizing each other is unlikely but we can still very much go with it. It provides us with an ending that we see coming a mile away but there is still something in it to make us like it.In this love story, there are a lot of hidden messages and surprises offered. Through the book theme, we learn what it means to own a book company whether big or small. We also get to watch life as it was in 1998 which is quite interesting close to twenty years after the fact. Even though it is redundant in every shape of form, we do learn a little about dating and how that works. From Greg Kinnear to Steve Zahn, You've Got Mail has a surprisingly strong supporting cast for a type of film like this. It's a very needed part of a love story that's only half- good.You've Got Mail is far from an outstanding love story. As mentioned earlier, it's as dated as it ever could be and the leads have done much better romantic films. That said, You've Got Mail is still very much revolutionary while still sappy.

Tom & Meg have great chemistry and that was already proven in Sleepless in Seattle. Meg´s great and as lively as always! This film belongs to my Christmas time movies.

128,m0rphy,"Rehash of ""Sleepless In Seattle""",6,18 March 2004,"I tuned into this film tonight after its opening titles had elapsed so was not sure of its title.For a while I thought I was watching its earlier incarnation as per my title.Even the walkways of the marina were similar confusing me and of course the primary plot was the same.I do not like films which stretch one's credulity too far unless it is out and out fantasy fiction.1.You have to believe out of all the people in the world these two correspond by internet chatroom to each other but actually live virtually next door to each other - one coincidence too far!2.A woman customer breaks down in tears when reminiscing in Meg Ryan's bookshop about reading ""Anne of Green Gables"" in the days when Meg's mother was its owner!!3.Tom Hanks gave many clues of his real identity after she was ""stood up"" at the initial restaurant rendezvous as her internet chat room pal, yet Meg Ryan consistently did not ""suss"" who he really was until the last scene. 4.Their respective present partners showed no compatibility to each other and it made we wonder what they saw in each other in the first place to actually marry them.In a way I was more interested in their fate as we all knew MR and TH would end up together almost from the off.5.Despite knowing Meg Ryan's love of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" Tom Hanks seemed particularly inept on several occasions even knowing the faintest plot or motivation of the central characters of this book.(I would have at least done a bit of homework first before sending off my latest transmission)This and other irritating events disturbed my sense of logic throughout the film.Yet it is rare for something to be either wholly good or bad and there were a few bright flourishes which amused me.One was the rather pretentious prose used by Meg Ryan's partner when he types a phrase to her on his old fashioned electric typewriter while in her presence.Incidentally by 1998 were not people generally using word processors? And why is it that all film actors in scenes involving typing can do 120 w.p.m.? I thought the plot was just too ""pat"" for my liking and the finale was telegraphed a 100 miles away.Notwithstanding my criticism, I did enjoy most of it but certainly not as much as the original in my title.Generally I find sequels a let down as Hollywood producers just cannot resist repeating a successful formula, although I do concede the two principal actors do have chemistry together on screen so I understand why it was produced.I rated it 6/10 compared to the present values of 6.7 for SIS and 6.2 for this film.",You've Got Mail
129,mirkobozic,Warm&cozy,10,25 October 2016,"""You Got Mail"" is a warm, cozy movie, almost as much as Kathleen Kelly's(Meg Ryan) corner bookshop around which the plot is centered. The place has a cult status and fans that run to its defense when Fox Books, a large bookstore chain announces opening their own big bookshop across the street. The two main antagonists, Kelly and Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) soon clash over work ethics and the future of the little shop, which of course, eventually loses the battle. Both of them start an internet friendship without being aware of each other's identities, so two parallel plots start developing until they intersect in the finale. There's a great deal of comedy and great production design, which kind of makes you overlook the predictability of the plot (it's very clear where the whole thing is headed early on). The movie also addresses the issues small businesses are facing because of large corporations, making you root for the underdog, with the bookshop's homely atmosphere where you expect warm cocoa instead of designer frappucinos. There's even a nostalgic streak to it, with the dial-up tone and the AOL messenger, from the time Facebook& Instagram was still pure Sci-Fi. And one loves the movie for the amazing Manhattan landscapes as well, the brownstone interiors and a milieu of characters popular in Woody Allen's New York: writers, critics, publishers, artists. The whole movie makes you want to grab a good book and go to your neighborhood cafe. The supporting cast is brilliant, like Greg Kinnear. And it has to be said-""You Got Mail"" has one of the best break-up scenes ever, where Ryan and Kinnear simultaneously confess they no longer love each other, just to jump to inquiring about new partners as if nothing had happened.

Meg Ryan is over the top cutesy to the point of inducing nausea. This is a business savvy New Yorker? She seems to barely have the wherewithal to tie her shoes let alone own a store. The supporting characters are weak and completely waste the talents of Parker Posey, Greg Kinnear and Steve Zahn (all awesome actors). Even Dave Chapelle sucked, but to be fair he had nothing to work with and had no real character at all. What a waste!Perhaps it is the on screen charisma of Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks that made me watch this inanity to the end. It's bizarre to me that Meg Ryan was nominated for a Golden Globe for this.

145,hitchs,Underrated,8,2 February 2002,"I usually dislike romantic comedies (couldn't stand When Harry Met Sally, which is more about sex than romance anyway), but this one is so far superior to the usual, and so full of subtleties, that it is worth seeing again and again. I'm surprised that so many people find it simplistic or shallow, because it is neither. Rather than the all-too-common scenario in which two people start out hating each other and then realise what they have in common and fall in love, this one uses the device of an email relationship to allow the two people to influence each other subtly so that both of them come to realise their inadequacies. I was particularly impressed by the way Tom Hanks's character, being forced to look at a situation from two entirely different perspectives, gradually comes to a realisation of what is wrong with his treatment of other people and begins to change his own behaviour. The result is thus far more believable than the usual sudden or unexplained changes in these movies. (I thought this was managed far better here than in Shop Around the Corner.)The dialogue is also very good, so the inevitable romantic ending manages to rise above the cliches. Of course, Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan both do a brilliant job. And I have to admit I loved the music, especially all the old Harry Nilsson songs).The only thing I didn't like was the assumption, so common in movies these days, that marriage is almost non-existent but people just move in together (especially in New York City).

Instead, we are treated to weird, pointless details such as the fact Joe Fox's father and grandfather keep reproducing with younger and younger women. The writer seems to get a kick out of introducing Fox's eight year old aunt and her playmate, Joe's four year old brother, and watching the reactions of fellow characters.

In part, this may be because there are so many similar romantic comedies out there that many of their aspects begin to seem too similar and purposeful to the viewer. One such aspect in this movie was the extended time at the beginning of the movie when the wonderfulness of the characters were introduced to the viewers in a lengthy exposition of Joe (Hanks) taking care of the children and Kathleen (Ryan) doing likewise with another bunch of children.My main problem, however, is with the ending of the movie, so SPOILERS ahead: The beginning parts of the movie worked pretty well until the time came to turn Joe and Kathleen into a couple. The part of the movie with their friendly meetings in cafes and on streets seemed rushed. Likewise, the last line in the movie was awful: ""I so hoped that it would be you"". If she had fallen in love with our average Joe, why did she go to the meeting place and not just? If she suspected that Joe was the mystery-man, why did she not confront him about it?The fact that Kathleen went to the meeting place should have told Joe that she had fallen in love with a fantasy and not the man that he really was (since they knew each other both ways).

But I have to say, I did enjoy You've Got Mail much much more than I ever expected to, having rented it two years after the film's original release while living on the upper east side of Manhattan, partially because I suppose I was curious to see what another New York film would whine about.  Sadly, Meg Ryan did not, as usual, stretch her range very far for this film, but once again as far as the demands of her role are concerned, she was well cast.  Nevertheless, in this film, she does manage to be charming.  There was a moment in which I found myself unexpectedly moved by her for the first time, in the scene where she relives a memory of ""twirling"" with her mother.  Though I was never a Meg Ryan fan before, I found I liked her character in this film and her performance of the stalwart Kathleen Kelly (could she really exist in New York, though?).  And though I have begun to feel that Tom Hanks is becoming a tediously ubiquitous face in Hollywood, much like Gerard Depardieu in France, I found his performance intriguing, as he avoided the pitfall of another clean cut Jimmy Stewart type nice guy role and allowed himself to appear as a modest modern villain: the head of a soul-eating big books corporation.  Greg Kinnear's eccentric performance as Kathleen Kelly's writer/boyfriend Frank is very humorous and shines within the supporting cast.  In general, this film is enjoyable, even though the plot is somewhat predictable.  I liked it nonetheless and would recommend it, to sentimentalists and skeptics alike.  Tom Hank's partial reformation and quest for redemption and reward is particularly believable and cleverly concocted.  This is a romantic-comedy lover's must-see, and others will like it, too.

I haven't seen his tour de force performances in Philadelphia (1993) Forrest Gump(1994) and Green Mile(1999). I'm working my way up to them. He was great as the plucky, pleasant yet steely World War 2 Captain from Saving Private Ryan (1998). He was absolutely bonkers as the foreigner without a country stuck in an airport in The Terminal (2004). He was enjoyable as the middle-aged man trying to finish college for gainful employment in Larry Crowne (2011).Meg Ryan was once America's sweetheart. Until, apparently, she cheated on her then husband with Russell Crowe. Her career has never reached the stratospheric heights of the 90s since. I actually don't care about any of that. I have only seen her in one movie, Top Gun (1985), where she appears in a few scenes as the vivacious, attractive wife of Maverick's wingman Goose, who may or may not know of his bisexual tendencies. She struck me even then, when I did not know who she was.You've Got Mail, for me, is the first time I'm watching America's former sweethearts on screen together, which is, paradoxically, the last time they appeared together, so far at least. I can see why they set box office records on fire. Under the capable hands of Nora Ephron, the story of two people who are in an online romance who are unaware that they are owners of two rival bookstores, gain uncommon colour. There is a sense of joy and wonder in how Ephron shoots New York, in autumn, I'm assuming, in all its colours and various local attractions. I checked, and found out that it's based on a play, and why not? The movie is undeniably cute, and I'm sure the author must have been pleased with the way the characters and the city they inhabit in were brought alive on screen.Tom Hanks gives warmth to the executive who runs the Fox bookstore chain, which, going by the hints in the movie, is only a small fraction of his father and grandfather's business empire. He zips through the movie, spring in his step, spreading kindness around, and you could almost forgive him for all the small bookshops his megastore must've closed. I was surprised to recognize Dave Chappelle, in what must've been his Comedy Central heydays, playing the role of Tom Hanks' executive ""Black best friend"". It is a stereotypical thankless role, but Chappelle elevates it the way he invariably does, infusing the role with a dry humour and matter-of-factness that makes him feel like a real friend. There was a lot of potential in this unlikely pairing which went underutilized because Ephron concentrated on telling the love story.Meg Ryan zips about the movie as well, running her niche children's bookstore, having expensive breakfasts with her rich aunt, and living the perfect life in the city of Dreams. Like in most rom coms, her place is too nice to have maintained on such income, even taking into account the rich aunt. Her intellectual reporter boyfriend, played delightfully by Greg Kinnear, seems to be yet another of those stereotypical college socialists who never realized to discard those dangerous ideas after graduation.Hanks' and Ryan's characters have been in touch with each other before the movie begins, through an AOL chat room, those painfully slow internet mailing services that would confound the millennials today. They don't know who they are, and when Hanks comes to New York and establishes a Fox mega bookstore nearby Ryan's ""Shop around the corner"", they inevitably come into conflict. The movie proceeds along familiar character and story beats, although it kind of seems to lose its pacing a bit in the last ten minutes. Still, Hanks and Ryan remain one of the best onscreen couples to watch, and certainly compared to what we've got from Hollywood in the last two decades.I shall leave things here, to be enjoyed at your pleasure when you have an afternoon free.VERDICTActing: Cute, very cute.
Music: Unremarkable, but alright
Direction: Good
Screenplay: Except last ten minutes, good.
Cinematography: This is the New York we foreigners fall in love with.This is a cute, silly, slight little movie, best watched with your significant other, on a balcony with a cup of tea and bread, while it rains.

Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan! I love these people! Sleepless in Seattle (1993) is next on the list.
Lesbian couple mentioned without much fuss. Progressive, I think, even for 1998.

159,barfly99,Cloying and lazily constructed attempt at romantic comedy,3,20 May 2000,"Like one or two of the other reviewers, I too was almost moved to tears by the end of this movie. I had just witnessed a dreary, drippy, forgettable piece of film-making that cost an obscene amount of money. Apart from the futility of remaking a close to perfect film in the first place (THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER), adding the e-mail element doesn't work because e-mail and the internet play so little part in the romance or the film as a whole. But what really sinks this movie is that the mechanics of the plot are stuck in the syrup of sentimentality. It's so busy being fluffy that even if it was as witty and charming as it thinks it is (which it ain't), it would still need some semblance of drama or believable conflict or just about anything except unrelenting ""cuteness"". The inevitability of every single detail working out absolutely perfectly for everyone is just too much.

One wants to write ""You've got Male! And Female!"" or maybe ""You've got a Remake!"" or ""You've got Tom and Meg Again!"" The fact is that a solid team put this piece together. Say what you will about Meg Ryan, Nora Ephron, and Tom Hanks, they know what it takes to put together a solid romantic comedy. Is this the most original romantic comedy? No. Is it a solid piece of work, considering the genre - and by that I mean light, fluffy romantic comedies - sure.I think few people will go into this expecting hard hitting movie, which is good because this is a bit like cotton candy. Hardly filling, but not bad for a lazy afternoon.A word on the casting. It's loaded with excellent actors: Ryan and Hanks, of course, but also Dabney Coleman, Greg Kinnear, Parker Posey, Jean Stapleton, Steve Zahn, John Randolph. Any one of them could have carried a significant portion of the film themselves, but instead their parts seem to have been cut way back. It's too bad they didn't develop these parts more, considering the talent they had on hand.I understand that, according to the trivia on this site, the great Michael Palin even filmed afew scenes, which were cut. I find it astonishing that anyone in their right mind would do such a thing. Rule #1 of film-making: Don't if you can get Palin to do your movie, by all means keep his stuff in.",You've Got Mail

163,Psyche-8,Enough sparkle between the leads to carry the film,7,24 April 2017,"'You've Got Mail' is one of those films that's grown on me over the years through repeat viewings, perhaps as the idea of falling in love online has really taken hold. Now, with the likes of match.com, OK Cupid, Tinder, Plenty Of Fish (to name but a few) firmly in our midst, it is no longer so unusual to meet – and indeed be unfaithful with – someone online. But 'You've Got Mail' was there at the very start in what we perceive – perhaps with some accuracy - to be more innocent times when the idea of email and the internet was still a novelty and thus far undiscovered by the weirdos, creeps and jerks! Ah, those were the days.The film's central concept is simple enough. Thirtysomethings Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) and Joe Fox (Tom Hanks) both work in the book business and both feel that there is something missing from their long term relationships with other people (Greg Kinnear for her, Parker Posey for him). The film opens in media res with what has clearly become a daily routine over the past few weeks of Kathleen and Joe covertly sending friendly and flirty emails to each other after their respective partners have left for work. From the opening scene, the audience discovers that Joe's 'NY152' and Kathleen's 'Shopgirl' 'met' in an online chatroom some weeks prior, and that up to this point neither knows the other's real life name or identity, both acknowledging that they have so far been careful not to reveal personal details (although it is not clear why this is). What is clear is that they have started to form an emotional attachment. Kathleen runs a small independent children's bookshop that her mother left her and has a large following of regular customers, while Joe co-runs his family's business 'Fox Books', a large US-wide chain of bookstores. Joe is about to open a large 'Fox Books' store round the corner from Kathleen's bookshop, threatening its survival. Joe also happens to meet Kathleen by accident when he visits her shop with his young relatives and is charmed by her, although he is careful to conceal who he really is, while Kathleen also feels a spark for him. She later learns his true identity when they bump into each other at a party and any initial attraction they felt goes out of the window as the two begin to bicker as Kathleen begins to realise the potential threat that Joe's big conglomerate poses, while Joe belittles and demeans her. And so forms the pattern of their relationship during the film as they continue to clash in real life while their online relationship goes from strength to strength as each remains ignorant of the other's identity.The first time I watched this, I found it frustrating that Kathleen could be so naïve and know so little about her business so as not to realise at first just what a big a risk the 'Fox Books' store poses to her. Her naivety is meant to be part of her charm and what contrasts her with Parker Posey's more ruthless and cut-throat Patricia but it doesn't even occur to her to start to look around for new premises. If she'd acted more quickly – or even at all – she could have just been looking at relocation rather than closing. I found it equally frustrating that after finding out that Kathleen and 'Shopgirl' are one and the same, Joe doesn't reveal himself to her straightaway (although having now seen the film a few more times I don't think Kathleen would have run straight into his arms). Even so, the whole last half hour of the film as Joe works to befriend Kathleen before the 'big reveal' was too drawn out.'You've Got Mail' is an undemanding film that follows the rom-com formula almost to the letter and while it won't win any prizes for originality (both Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan could play these roles backwards), there's enough sparkle between the two leads to make this worth a watch and maybe the odd repeat viewing if it's on TV.",You've Got Mail
164,susan7,A strangely compelling movie that I can't seem to stay away from.,10,1 February 2001,"When I first saw ""You've Got Mail,"" I didn't like it as much as I liked ""Sleepless in Seattle,"" so I gave it a 7.  But the movie haunted me, so I watched it again the next day, and gave it an 8.  It still wouldn't let me alone, so the next month I gave it a 9.  So all right already, six months later, I'm giving it a 10.Now why, you might ask, would I give this movie a 10.  It is not an action movie.  It has no gratuitous sex, no foul language, no senseless death in mountains of living color and tons of gore, and no stunning musical score. It has no visually stunning graphics, and it doesn't have any really compelling or dynamic characters.  In short, it doesn't seem to have anything that would make it appeal to the masses.  So why a 10.  The answer is that the thing just won't let me alone.  I keep watching it and watching it.  It appeals to the emotional side of me.  And any story that can reach down and touch me like that, has to be well written and well acted, so much so that it does it's job and has its subtle affect before the viewer is even aware that he or she has been hooked.  That is a rare quality, yet such is the quality of the movie we have before us.  That is what makes ""You've Got Mail"" worth a 10.Perhaps I am becoming more appreciative of romance and simple, down-to-earth characters than I once was.  Perhaps I'm beginning to understand that life doesn't revolve around violence, sex, and shock language.  Perhaps I'm simply coming back to what I've always known.  Whatever the reason, this movie (and movies like it) make it happen for me.  They are more satisfying than any I can remember seeing in the past.  I hope this is a trend in the industry.A simple boy meets girl, girl meets boy, movie told with elegance and taste. See the movie.  Buy the movie.  Enjoy!",You've Got Mail

There is unconvincing parts all through it. Like she would accept the friendship of a man who put her out of business. The horrible woman he was seeing, I mean really, she had no redeeming features, would he really go with her?

Although Meg Ryan still tries to pass herself off as a girl she cannot hide the fact that it no longer rings quite as true as it once did ten years ago. The dialogues between Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan often misfire and are on occasion even too contrived to be funny. The camera-work is good and the film has some lovely atmospheric shots of NYC in Autumn and Spring.NB. It has been quite a few years since I wrote this review and I now find it needlessly harsh, if only because I enjoy the film now more than I did when the review was first written. That may be because there haven't been that many good romantic comedies since (the genre is clearly in decline) or I have learned to appreciate the merits I initially overlooked.

172,missrljane,"Refreshing, intelligent rom com that works, if only that final scene had been developed",8,22 May 2008,"You've Got Mail takes romance and feel-good film clichés, and handles them refreshingly, intelligently and believably with a witty and bouncy script and style, heavily developed characters and is full of nice details, particularly how in love the meaningless becomes meaningful.The plot is vaguely reminiscent of the 1940 film The Shop Around The Corner, enemies who unwittingly fall in love through the written word, and nods its head to this, but the romance in You've Got Mail is far more central to the plot and the situations and set-up are completely different.Kathleen owns a friendly children's bookshop, and Joe owns part of a big bad chain store that threatens to swallow Kathleen's simple existence whole, causing Joe to suffer for the pain he causes the woman he loves. This makes Joe a fascinating romantic lead. He is a callous businessman, but with depth and humour as a person. His horror at discovering his anonymous lover is his enemy, the inner turmoil bubbling beneath his eyes for what he has done and his desperation to befriend her and be forgiven when he knows it is too late is all superbly acted by Tom Hanks. Rom-com leads usually go from enemies to lovers, and it is wonderful to see the friendship stage actually broached for once.The film balances humour and wistfulness with heartbreaking despair, depths not usually covered by rom-coms, as Kathleen must watch all her efforts fail as she loses her mother's shop. It is also pleasing that Kathleen's relationship with boyfriend Frank comes to a natural end, rather than the usual dumping that goes on in such films, and both this relationship and that between Joe and girlfriend Patricia are cleverly set up to show why the couples are together, but that there is no possibility of the long term for them.However, the ending irritatingly sabotages You've Got Mail's chances of being a classic. Once Kathleen loses her shop, the film switches almost entirely to Joe's perspective, as he tries to become her friend. This throws off the delicate balance that has been the structure so far. And then the last scene, in which Kathleen waits to meet her anonymous lover and is presented with Joe, doesn't work. The 'surprise' tactic is tasteless, as is confirmed by Kathleen bursting into tears, not really the happy ending desired, but instead of these two witty, intelligent and deep people, so recently bitter enemies but now close friends, discussing the coincidence, irony and subterfuge of this situation, they kiss.One of the best rom-coms made, but the ending brutally stops it being perfect.",You've Got Mail

It was the kind of movie that you watched, and suddenly wanted to go to New York and take a look around the upper west side and see for yourself it's mysteries, and rituals.Remember when an instant message would startle you? Remember when you wandered into chat rooms and actually enjoyed doing so? Remember when you could spend hours and hours online and not think about the damage to your circulatory system? Yeah, me too! Now post 9/11 and post dial up connection for many of us, we watch the movie and marvel at how stark the AOL program looks. We see them dial up and think.....yeah, once that was the only way to connect.We watch this movie, and we look for glimpses of the World Trade Centers. We know that building them back will eventually happen, but nothing will ever replace the way those buildings stood, and the majestic and formidable skyline that they painted for Manhatten. Those of us who are avid readers marvel at the books that are introduced in the movie, and smile recalling our days of youth when we read those same classic children's books.We discover New York in the fall, and it's crispness. We see New York in the spring, and marvel out how much more alive everything seems no matter what time of the year it is. We see glimpses of winter, but even that does not deter the largest city in the USA from tourism, shopping, and daily strife. We get a sense of career driven people that seem to live, eat, breathe, and sleep work. Even to see them at a social gathering shows that they are there to make important contacts or be noticed in some sense of the word. We see a character who is an absolute introvert--that being Frank. We see the extroverted Meg Ryan trying to hold the relationship together, and not really sure why. Then we see what happens, and because she is not able to write boring narcissistic Frank off, she turns to the ""dream of someone else"" and discovers that there is nothing more powerful than the written word.Modern technology in the internet has brought us back to the power of the written word. We can churn out notes, and communications quicker this way than by writing and mailing them via snail mail. Still this revelation is not without some hang ups.

They handled all their materials given perfectly, and not one single beat was missing in their performances. However, this film brought so little of it and yet painted Hanks' character as a little bit creepy man who isn't truthful.The plot was a little creative, but it came to a generic conclusion nonetheless.

The plot judders discernibly, though is drawn out, like most passable romantic movies, skillfully.Put simply, there are far better cheap romances than this, a lot of recent teen movies and, notably, Sleepless in Seattle, which you should see before this.",You've Got Mail

The good ones (""Only You"", ""Sleepless in Seattle"", etc.) have the tendency to depress me afterwards for reasons I won't go into here.  ""You've Got Mail"" wasn't successful in making me feel depressed.2. I felt that Tom Hanks was basically being mean to Meg Ryan, both for wrecking her business, and for not telling her who he was right away and playing with her emotions.The good side was that Meg Ryan is really cool.",You've Got Mail
190,luvnsweet,This is a good movie,9,9 April 2000,This is actually a pretty good movie starring Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. It's kinda like their old movie Sleepless in Seattle but I like this movie much more better because the two characters have more time on screen together. This movie is about these two people that live in New York that they fall in love over the internet but ooutside their business rivals. Tom Hanks's character Joe Fox owns a big bookstore company while Meg Ryan's character Kathleen Kelly owns a small bookstore and is running out of business.

193,Jotho,Nora Ephron can do better,4,31 December 1998,"Many years ago I loved the book and film Heartburn. So I was delighted to take my next door neighbour (Laura, age 11) to see this latest effort by Nora Ephron. I was very disappointed.  Somehow, I wouldn't have thought this writer/director would make a screen hero out of Meg Ryan's character.  So wholesome, so pretty, so polite, and loyal to her staff and her mother's memory.  Her biggest problem is that she can't be horrible and stick up for herself, which is of course why she is so lovable.  Blecch.  Aren't movie-goers generally fed up with female actors who look sexy and adorable even when they have a disgusting flu? This is one of those films where every surface is polished, the children are endearing and cute, and the email connection only ever takes .5 seconds.  Mind you, I can forgive Tom Hanks his tedious virtues, largely because I am never going to see Saving Whosywhatsit. He is proof that male actors don't have to be perfectly photogenic in every scene to be the object of my desire. The other male lead got off badly, as did political correctness.  The contempt heaped upon his efforts to be ideologically sound was balanced by the best performer in the show, the supposedly bitchy wicked witch of a girlfriend Tom's character dumped.  She was great, and all the better for the relief she provided from the worst excesses of American sugar coatings.  Come to think of it, I suppose that is the role of the baddie. It's the story that's so mundane.  Even Laura thought the film ""was missing something"".  ""Dramatic tension"" I suggested.  She didn't argue.  This is a film of NO SURPRISES! There is one great thing about this film.  The opening sequence and the introduction to New York felt authentic and I loved the feeling I was visiting the city.  This is a pretty dubious commendation, as I haven't even been to the northern hemisphere, let alone NYC.",You've Got Mail

That's why this movie caught me off guard.  ""You've Got Mail"" is filled with the romance that the typical Hanks/Ryan fluff is missing (f.e. They didn't even kiss in ""Sleepless"" for God's sake!).  It amazes me that after working together on so many projects, Hanks and Ryan can still submit a believable chemistry onto the screen; but boy can they ever!  The plot was adorable and the movie itself was a sweet, ironic, whole-hearted romance which finally produced a pairing of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan that is definitely worth watching.

Third, if you have ever seen ""Shop around the Corner"", the elder inspiration for this piece starring Jimmy Stewart, you will appreciate this loving and updated remake.

200,gary-1234,Good Get to Know You Movie,7,30 December 2007,"I am a guy and as others have said, guys like this movie. Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are one of those screen couples that seem to just ""Mesh."" I get the same feeling about Travolta and Kirstie Alley in the Look Who's Talking movies. Some people compared this to When Harry Met Sally, but these movies are no where near the same, and as I said, Hanks and Ryan make the better couple.The movie is a remake of Shop Around the Corner and updated for the times, 1998 I may add. The allure of internet movies I think has past. But for 1998, it's a nice little story of two people who hate each other in real life but really love each other as their anonymous selves via email and chat. This topic may be sordid now, with all of the stories of internet affairs, but not in this movie. There are some holes in this movie, but as in most movies, they don't really hurt. There are times you'll feel they should be able to realize who each other are. And for most people who don't over analyze as I do, you won't notice.You can tell how the plot line is going to develop but for a first time viewer it's really a nice, fun movie. This is a good 2nd or 3rd date type movie if you're really interested in the person. This is the kind of movie where you want to sit close on the couch and see if snuggling develops.

But You've Got Mail is not one of those films.Finally I watched it on TV and my first thoughts were 'how did I miss this film for this long!'. Yes it's about love, but with honesty, simplicity and passion. Firstly I thought the writing and direction was excellent, the dialogues evolves naturally. Joe - we all know Tome Hanks is a great actor, he nailed it. Kathleen - is well written. Lovely, intelligent, honest, courageous, genuine, passionate about what she does. She tries to run the book shop with lot of love and memory and lives a small but meaningfull life. This girl doesn't need heavy makeup, branded clothes, high heels to feel confident and feel good about herself. I thought Meg Ryan performed it absolutely brilliantly. She played it so subtly with her awesome expressions and we can understand her feelings. Especially in the coffee shop scene, the scene she visits Fox's shop, the last day at the shop scene - it was very moving, I felt heartbroken for her. But it wasn't her end, she comes back strong. The last 30-45min were really lovely with right dose of humor, emotion and love and was very pleasant.This film is also about about how big money businesses crushing the small independent businesses, and how people judge each other quickly in circumstances without knowing about them and feel hatred, which is the world we presently live in. With online dating, people don't even talk in person anymore and simply gets judged by their profile pictures.Overall, it's a simple, honest film, in a calm pace, with lovely characters played by brilliant actors, enough emotion and lot of warmth and very refreshing. Nora Ephron deserves all the applauds for putting it all together. This film would connect the audience if it had released now.",You've Got Mail
203,srfotog,Too bad.,4,1 January 1999,"I think this movie could have been much better, had they not used a tired, old plot of the man taking over the woman's business, then charming her into a love affair. I think it's insulting to women today to think she would just cave in and fall in love after he destroyed her life.Plus I didn't think it was very funny about cheating on your mate on the computer. Are we so hardened these days that betrayal is cute?Another thing is the age of the protagonists. Meg Ryan is very attractive, but she is hardly an ingenue. Hanks' face is actually puffy, either from overweight or age. I think the plot would have worked better with younger actors. And the betrayals wouldn't have seemed so awkward if the actors were younger.The other thing that bothered me about the movie was the sad fact that we are so lonely we would actually have a love affair on a computer.

The male character was a struggling salesman who works hard to impress his manager, a hard, but vulnerable man. And the woman was desperate to get a job for the holiday season and when the male refuses to give her a job, she goes right over his head and gets it from his boss, thus setting up a great rivalry between them. And while there was some rivalry between Tom and Meg's characters, there was no passion, or real sexual tension between them.This is a typical, Nora Ephron movie.

208,drifteru,Now it's the Internet that makes them sleepless...,4,13 January 1999,"With PATCH ADAMS and STEPMOM, YOU'VE GOT MAIL completes a trio of manipulative mediocrities for the 1998 holiday season.  Nora Ephron's new film is practically a case study in how they don't make 'em like they used to.  In an attempt to recapture the mood (and success) of SLEEPLESS IN SEATTLE, Ephron tries to shoehorn Ernst Lubitsch's great classic romance, THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER, to fit SEATTLE's formula:  same stars, same delayed meeting, same reference to film taste as a key to understanding the sexes (men are from THE GODFATHER here), same incessant use of instantly recognizable songs as shorthand for real emotional involvement.What makes MAIL bearable is the enduring appeal of the cast, though even that is undercut by a script that asks us to believe that lifelong commitment to anything but love is petty.  Pitting the main characters against each other as representatives of the battle between big corporate America and the small entrepreneur is frankly more than this trifling film can handle.  Lubitsch knew what he was about when he kept his film small.  A focused beam burns hotter.",You've Got Mail

It is both a homage to the locally-owned neighborhood bookstore and the changing media and economic landscape of the 1990s.Of Ryan's many comedies of the period, this is among my favorites and the best of the ones with Hanks as her co-star. The film has a wonderful soundtrack featuring the underrated Harry Nilsson, who died too young four years prior to the film's release.The film's final scene with Nilsson's rendition of ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow"" playing in the background is an intelligent, welcome, and heart-tugging denouement.

The casting was inspired, particularly Dabney Coleman and John Randolph as Hank's father and uncle (I believe). The dialogue is far more inspired than in ""Sleepless"" and the story more engaging. The biting exchanges between Ryan and Hanks are wonderful and all the more so because they both admit to feeling remorse afterwards.

And then she gets her coffee at Starbucks.  Yeah right!  How dumb is Ryan's character anyway?  While she enjoys her coffee she's helping put out of business all the local mom and pop coffee shops.Tom Hanks' character, while becoming more compassionate in his personal approach, makes no change whatsoever in his business practices.  Ryan's character teaches him to be kinder, but that's all.  And she decides to be with him, even though he'll go on to put other small stores out of business just like her's.  What will happen to their happily ever after ending when she sees him do this to another person, except this time he does it with more ""compassion?""  Because Hanks' character didn't truly change (he would have had to denounce his family's business practices), the message is clear: Give in, submit to big business.Even the very set-up of this film is sexist.  Reverse the roles in this film. Suppose Hanks was Ryan and vice versa.  What would audiences think of a man who fell in love with the woman who put him out of business?  They wouldn't watch it, that's what.  He'd be a wuss, absolutely whipped.  But because it's a woman being screwed, it's ok.

That happens you know....a great movie can be on but you're just not in the right mood, not receptive.  You see it on a different occasion and it's another story...like anything.  Meg Ryan brings great delight and heart to her character in this film.  How you could criticize that I will never understand.  Everyone in my opinion is wonderful and hilarious in this movie.  Really.  The movie is one great moment.  And personally there is nothing wrong with an ending that isn't depressing..ok....life is about triumph and joy too you know.  All endings are good as long as there is real heart and truth to them.  And there is nothing wrong with having fun.  Amen. This movie is about everything, about heartbreak, beginnings, endings, middles....my only advice....dig in and enjoy!!!   A+ in my book.  (The kind of movie that stays with you.)",You've Got Mail

229,onestephenis,Too bad it doesn't age well,8,7 June 2017,"If you saw this movie in the late 90's you could be totally forgiven for claiming, perhaps somewhat absurdly, that it was one of the best modern love stories ever filmed.If you were born after this movie came out it would be almost impossible for you to really get it. This movie has aged worse than almost any movie I've ever seen. I liked it a lot when it first came out, and I still liked it just fine when I recently re-watched it. But I can remember those times. Younger people are more likely to be able to empathize with Romeo and Juliet than this movie that takes place hundreds of years closer to modern times.I can't give this movie the title 'classic' because a movie has to hold up for a lot longer than this movie did. But if you're over thirty-ish and have never seen it you might enjoy some fond memories of those times almost as much as the movie itself.Really good movie. I loved it. But I can easily understand how younger people might disagree.",You've Got Mail
230,Keely,No surprises,3,16 June 1999,"Having seen and loved the original movie on which this is based, the amazing ""Shop Around the Corner,"" and being a fan of movies that spoof modern culture, I was prepared to like ""You've Got Mail.""  I wasn't prepared for it to be such a disappointment.  There were some enjoyable things about it, which I'm sure you'll read about in other reviews, but far fewer that I would expect for all the star power put into this.  In fact, it felt like the author and filmmakers decided that as long as they had the star power, they could cheat a little on the other stuff, and they did - especially if you kept waiting for the wonderful, revelatory scenes from the original that you thought were coming.  A funny subplot about both of the stars' respective mates, played by Greg Kinnear and Parker Posey, who are good but wasted, is started and then inexplicably dropped.  All the surprises have been taken out of this version -- in fact, when the climactic scene occurs where Meg Ryan discovers her secret pen pal, it's flat, and the way the plot's conflict is resolved feels like one big sellout.There was one thing I respected this movie for, and it was the theme that it never works to be cruel to anyone, even your enemies.  The theme is not just stated, it's dramatized well in a couple of touching scenes with Ryan and Hanks.  But with that kind of a message, I would expect a much better movie.",You've Got Mail
231,eavgerinos,"Terribly cheesy, unbearably predictable, shockingly boring",4,8 March 1999,"Media say that the film is as good as Sleepless in Seattle (1993), comparing the two films easily since the pair is the same (Hanks and Ryan) and they are both written and directed by Nora Ephron (amongst others also written and directed Michael (1996), This Is My Life (1992) and written My Blue Heaven (1990), When Harry Met Sally (1989), Silkwood (1983)). I am not going to discuss here either Ephron's abilities as a writer or director, or Hanks' and Ryan's acting talents, all well proven. Still, the film is terribly cheesy, unbearably predictable, shockingly boring, JUST LIKE SLEEPLESS !!! So, the comparison stands, YES, the two films are comparable (in boredom) and hugely inferior to When Harry Met Sally (1989) of the same genre, romantic comedy allow me to say, but with much more comedy and romance and an equally clever plot. I guess Tom Hanks will never forgive the superb Billy Crystal in When Harry Met Sally. And a lot of us will still bet it was Hanks in When Harry Met Sally, BUT HE WASN'T!To conclude, if you like the genre see again When Harry Met Sally instead of wasting time and money for You've Got Mail. It will soon be out on video anyway. Because I like Ephron, Hanks and Ryan anyway, 4 out of 10.",You've Got Mail
232,hendmik,"Mommy, Make It Go Away!!!",2,1 June 1999,"Like most, I was drawn to the film through the success of ""Sleepless,"" but I can't help but think the film makers missed the point on this one.Meg Ryan has been endearing and adorable in other films, but was pitiful and ""pouty"" in this one.  She can't bear the cross of the comic relief which I thought was obvious to all in ""French Kiss.""  And poor Tom Hanks is no romantic lead without Rob Reiner or Ross Malinger to play off of.  The characters of his father and grandfather were good in their own rights, but they were no awkward sidekicks that the audience could fall in love with.The supporting cast was all this film had going for it.  Greg Kinnear, Dabney, Jean, and John Randolph were the only reasons I looked up from my watch.Just like a good cookie still has salt in the recipe, You've Got Mail should have tried something else besides sugar for theirs.

This is as fine a Tom Hanks / Meg Ryan film as you will see. Both personalities were made for this script although it is more likely the script was made with then in mind. Hanks' world is dominated with being the 'Book Zsar' of New Yorks West Side but his life is turned upside down after an encounter in a jammned elevator. Meg Ryan is the sugary sweet heroine who falters not and just about keeps it together in the face of personal disaster. The characters transformation from bitter business rivals to the inevitable lovers is both as pleasant as it is expected. This does not spoil the film however as the journey to this end is what makes this film superb.

Meg Ryan, the small business owner, has her bookstore driven into the ground by Tom Hanks and his Borders type mega-store but all is forgiven in the name of love. I've never known destroying someone's livelihood to be an aphrodisiac. The rest is by the numbers romantic comedy. Trite, shallow, saccharine, completely without merit.

It's not a movie meant for someone to learn something, it's for someone who likes to laugh at witty remarks made by Tom and funny expressions made by Meg. Ofcourse, it's also not for practical people. We all know that online romances rarely work out. Romances like this one would NEVER even happen in the first place.

Joe Fox, Tom's character, is just an ordinary guy looking for love behind that rich, greedy exterior.

You can picture what happened then.  The quinkie - dink here is that Joe and Katherine met in an Over30 chat room under the screen-names NY152 and Shopgirl.  152 Riverside Dr. is Joe's address.  The rest you will have to see for yourself.  Because this is a romantic - comedy it will not get nominated for anything, though it should.

Due to these neuroses, it was hard to judge what the love interests' hearts were really made of?  Was it their musings posted via e-mail?

You've Got Mail is full of themes that lack easy answers.This movie is about perspectives - on people, on life, on love. The characters start off in one perspective, shift to another, and then have the final lens twisted into clarity at the end. Meg Ryan hates and loves the same man, with the fascinating twist that she doesn't know they're the same person. How can she love and hate the same man? It's a confounding question. What is the answer? You have to figure it out for yourself as you watch.What if the answer is to not need an answer? What if you can love someone without wanting to change them to suit how you want to feel about them? Meg Ryan has the latter but only online. In her off-screen life she has nothing but despair and sees nothing but threats and confrontation. But the ""real"" life is, well, real. Meg Ryan tried inviting the online fantasy into the real world, but he can't show up. Reality shows up but she doesn't recognize it. She doesn't see the love in herself and in the world even though as the audience we do - we have that perspective.The characters travel a lot in Sleepless in Seattle, but the real journeys are in You've Got Mail.",You've Got Mail

The issue here is that this is a movie that does not learn from its inspiration. The film was obviously intended to revisit themes touched on by ""Sleepless in Seattle"", but goes on to entirely miss the point of its previous incarnation.

This movie is one of the ones I love watching all the time. I read some of the reviews from people that disliked the movie and I would like to respond to some of those comments. Yes it doesn't seem to make sense that a woman who inherited a children's bookstore from her mother would fall in love with a rich guy who seemed to take pleasure in closing down small privately owned bookstores but neither one of them took an interest in the other until after Tom Hanks's character discovers that the mystery person he had been online friends with was the woman he had developed a heated rivalry with. Until then, they were bitter enemies. However, that discovery brought out the human side of Hanks's character. He knew he couldn't tell Meg Ryan's character that he was the one she had exchanged loving e-mails with for who knows how long. Not until he could get her to like him. He was disappointed about the discovery but then realized that it was a friendship he did not and could not end so he made the best of it and tried to be the nice guy she enjoyed e-mailing. When she finally took a liking to him, it made the meeting at the end easier for her to deal with. About the only thing I did not agree with in this movie was near the end when Hanks tries to get Ryan to forgive him by calling what he did ""a tiny little thing."" I'm sorry but putting someone out of business is not a tiny little thing in my book. At least Hanks was kind enough to hire George from her shop. No mention of what happened to the other girl. I did not like Greg Kinnear's character though. He seemed so full of himself and acted like everything he said and wrote was worthy of a Nobel Prize.",You've Got Mail

264,Lisa-66,"Cute, funny bit of fluff--all in all, a pretty good movie.",7,6 August 1999,"Cute-cute. Super-cute. Way-cute. From the always adorable Meg Ryan to the charming bookstore she owns to Tom Hanks' darling children relatives, this movie is cute. You can tell that's what they were aiming for, and baby, they made it. Fluffy-cute. Easter Bunny-cute. At times, nearly nauseatingly cute.But...I liked it. What can I say--I'm a sucker for romantic comedies, especially when they house one of my all-time favorite actresses (this would be Ryan). And I was pleasantly surprised by this film; it had some genuinely good moments. Anything with the dog, for starters. That was one great dog. And the scene where Ryan and Hanks discuss ""The Godfather"" lingo (""Go to the mattress.""). Pretty amusing stuff. Of course, that's not to say it didn't have it's ouchy moments too. Like the bit where Hanks takes his two child relatives (one's an aunt, the other's a brother--don't ask) to a Halloween street fair. Yeah, it was a cute touch and shows you how wonderful Hanks' character Joe Fox is, taking kids out for a good time. But it was completely superfluous. All it did was add a bag of fish and a couple balloons to the set. And provide a VERY longwinded excuse for Hanks and Co. to visit Ryan's shop.I think my biggest problem with this film had to do with three main things: (1) its overuse of sterotypes, to wit: good little guy (oh, sorry--girl) v. big bad corporate wolf theme (seen in probably 95% of all movies made anyway); predictably oddball characters; way-cute little kids and obvious romantic pairing of people (but since I've never seen a movie where it isn't obvious, I can't really hold this one against this flick); (2) Starbucks. I have nothing against the company, but I've never seen such blatant product placement in all my days; (3) the remaking of an older movie--why is every other film a remake anymore? What ever happened to original scripts?Still, all in all, it's really a pretty good movie. Ryan is wonderful and a little vulnerable as Kathleen Kelly, Hanks (as Joe Fox) is charming and funny, and there's an obvious rapport between them (as also evidenced in the other two films they were in together, ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and ""Joe Versus the Volcano""). The story is a sweet one, the supporting cast is pretty good overall and some moments are downright hilarious (Ryan had a beautiful moment of physical humor when she is psyching herself up for a ""war"" with Fox Books by shadowboxing behind the counter of her bookstore). And might I suggest that you check out the older film that this was based on. I can guarantee that it will increase your appreciation of ""You've Got Mail"" by pointing out all the little salutes to the original film, Ernst Lubitsch's brilliant 1940 ""The Shop Around the Corner"". For instance, the naming of Ryan's bookstore by using the title of the original, or my favorite bit, when Hanks goes to meet his cyberbuddy ""in the flesh,"" so to speak, not knowing she's actually Ryan. Hanks' friend Kevin (as brilliantly portrayed by David Chappelle) asks Hanks if the signal between the two of them is going to be a rose tucked in a book or something like that--the same identifier used in the original film. The way Kevin asks, it makes it sound like the character has actually seen ""The Shop Around the Corner"" and was basing his guess on that. But definately check the original out. Yeah, it's old. Yeah, it's black and white. No, they didn't have email. No, it wasn't set in a bookstore. But yes, it's an awesome film, with wonderful performances by all the members of the cast.

I waited until it was on TV and thought I might as well get it over with.  I'll admit, Tom Hanks is a great actor but his name has carried some awful mainstream movies.  This is no exception. Based on the play and subsequent movie, The Shop Around the Corner (1940), the plot and background story is changed drastically.  There is little on-screen chemistry between Hanks and Ryan here and even character inconsistency within the movie itself.  Then, with this story so different than the original, they copied a couple of scenes almost word for word and it came off so disjointed.  Tom Hanks is no Jimmy Stewart and Meg Ryan no Margaret Sullavan.  With few exceptions (eg. Maureen Stapleton), the supporting cast offered no help.  They were more annoying than the stars.  Again, a sharp contrast with the original where there were a couple of very witty subplots and extremely interesting side characters.

Now that I know this is a remake of a romcom from an earlier era, some of the scenarios make more sense and I can see them being delivered in a TransAtlantic accent, but I couldn't get over the bizarre sadistic sociopathy of Joe Fox knowing that Kathleen Kelly was unaware of who he was but choosing to brazenly manipulate her, ending in a twisted romantic finale (""i was hoping it was you!""). I think IRL the female lead would have exploded and pummeled such a twisted sneak. Unless of course she was so beaten down by losing her business that she'd accept anything.

But then, a public protest and media blitz shifted the public support to Kathleen's little 'Shop Around the Corner'. So I thought she was going to win, using the ideas Fox unwittingly gave her. Instead, for reasons never explained, Kathleen gives up and closes the store. And from there it's downhill as the story shifts to his attempt to woo her without telling her the truth. It's creepy as this 'It's business, not personal' person manipulates her during her depression and illness over her loss. So what that he feels guilty about what he did? There is no way in real life someone would submissively forgive-and-forget as she did.That's why I gave it a five. It could have worked if somehow Fox relented and figured a way for both stores to co-exist or even better, if he closed his store.

It showed distinctively with a bias no doubt that only the person whom you meet and know in real life eventually gets to your heart first. The way Hanks slowly ensnared Ryan's character without her knowing it and eventually winning it, perhaps Ryan's so-called ""love"" for NY152 might even melt if it didn't happen to be Hanks himself. Also, it was fairly unbelievable that Ryan's charcter would wittingly believe that she was in love with NY152, for the film certainly didn't give enough sense to it, and besides, we all know how grounded Meg Ryan is. Also, I was pretty disgusted with the way the usual machismo and shallow-mindedness at which Hanks' character displayed before he was to meet Ryan. It is only pure cowardice on the male side to be unable to accept someone not remotely as attractive as Meg Ryan.

It's hardly a relationship built on honesty, but perhaps that's to be expected, given that they start the affair online without revealing their real names or saying anything about their lives. This constipated pas de foux is dressed up in a New York City too neat and pretty for anyone who's been there to believe -- but after all,  the movie  is just a fairy tale.

(Spoiler alert!),1,15 March 2001,"First I will qualify this by saying that I enjoyed both Sleepless in Seattle and Joe vs. the Volcano, which are two other Tom Hanks - Meg Ryan romantic movies. Yes, even a heterosexual male such as myself can enjoy getting lost in a love story, if it's a good one.You've Got Mail! is anything but romantic. Basically what director Nora Ephron did is took the plot of The Shop Around the Corner and ""modernized"" it. In theory this would be fine and bringing Hanks and Ryan together again wasn't a bad idea... in theory. Somehow, Ephron created a movie about a predator (Hanks) and his prey (Ryan) which is not what the original movie was about, nor what a romantic movie should be about.The plot of this movie is basically this: Tom Hanks character, Joe Fox III is a millionaire businessman, not unlike a Donald Trump type person. Fox owns a chain of commercial bookstores/coffee houses. He wants to put one of his stores in every major business district and dominate the book/coffee business world. By doing so he's putting other small bookstores out of business. Enter Meg Ryan's character, Kathleen Kelly, who owns a small store around the corner that eventually she is forced to close due to Fox and his actions.Unknowingly, the two of them are friends via the internet. They fall for each other by email. Fox eventually finds out that Kathleen is the woman he has been talking to over the computer, but does not tell her. This is where the movie becomes truly horrible.What happens next is that Fox then manipulates Kathleen's feelings by pretending to be two different people, both himself and the ""internet friend"". He befriends her as Joe Fox in real life and keeps corresponding with her over the internet telling her completely different things under the guise of two different people. In doing so he confuses her and manipulates her. He sets up meetings with her via email and then doesn't show up (as his internet self), only to have his real life Fox self show up to cheer her up because she was ""stood up"". This is not romance, it's called cyber-stalking and it's a criminal act.I have a friend who was stalked via the internet and it's not romantic, it's a scary thing. You don't trick people into falling in love with you, and if someone feels the need to, they have serious emotional problems.If you are a woman and think this movie is truly romantic, then I urge you to seek counseling for your self-esteem. I am not saying this as an insult to you, I'm saying it as one human being truly concerned about another's well-being. If you feel it's romantic to have someone manipulate another to get them to fall in love, then I feel very sorry for you. There are too many women who are stalked, abused, aquaintance raped, tortured, etc. in this world and it all starts with manipulation and a man putting up a false front like Joe Fox did in this movie. Ask any woman who has been in an abusive relationship and they will tell you the same thing, ""He wasn't like that when I first met him, he seemed like a really nice guy.""That's what predators and abusers do, they manipulate and put up a guise of being a nice person. Just because Tom Hanks is a likeable guy, doesn't mean that his character is. Joe Fox is a stalker, and I urge you to avoid this movie if at all possible. I know I'm probably going to hear a lot of feedback about this. I'm going to hear, ""But it's not real life, you're taking it too seriously."" or ""Don't you know that people just like to get lost in a movie?"" There's nothing wrong with the suspension of disbelief or getting lost in a movie, even if it's not such a great movie, I've done it many times in my life. The fact is, that there are GOOD romantic movies out there that don't involving sneaky manipulative people.

The symbolism reminds the audience of what is important celebrating familial love, festivals and book shops. The songs are also very memorable and Christmasy. I couldn't resist this movie and if you like pride and prejudice or the godfather movies you will like this. There's something for everyone.",You've Got Mail
308,mike-51,Great Chemistry Re-lived,8,8 January 1999,Once again Tom & Meg's wonderful chemistry is brought out in the movie. The movie builds up rather slowly but brings out the reality of common use of the chat lines and the growing relationships over it. Though the movie copied the 'meeting in the cafe' scene from an earlier Jimmy Stewart movie (can't recollect the name).

309,CharlieR,Hanks and Ryan return and sparks fly,8,28 December 1998,"Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan may well be the Tracy and Hepburn of their generation. Each is an accomplished actor with a broad range, but their onscreen chemistry makes their appearances together something unforgettable. Viewers expecting a reprise of ""Sleepless in Seattle"" will not find it here. Nora Ephron has taken much of the same team, including the two stars, and turned out a very different romantic comedy that is every bit the equal of its predecessor.Meg Ryan's first scene has her prancing about the apartment with anticipation, looking for all the world like a 12-year-old with a gleeful secret all her own. She may be the only actress her age in the history of film to so completely revert to adolescence and get away with it, but get away with it she does.As the protagonists' relationship develops online and in real life, the viewer is drawn deeper into their lives, rooting them on in their quest for love and happiness, even as we realize the inevitability of success. It isn't the question of whether they will find each other that holds our attention, but how the miracle will occur. By the time the movie ends we're thoroughly enchanted by both Kathleen Kelly and Joe Fox, and the only regret we have is that we can't spend more time in their company.Dig out the rose colored glasses and settle yourself into your seat for the most delightful two hours of the season. This is the perfect antidote for holiday cynicism.",You've Got Mail
310,Jesse-13,Charming update of old stories and stars,7,27 December 1998,"It would be nearly impossible to make a movie about Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan falling in love without it having enormous charm.  Everyone who loves romantic comedy should love it.Having said that, it also should be said that the movie treats its stars as so special that it can take no chances.  It lacks the compelling innocence of Sleepless in Seattle.  The theme of the individual shopkeeper fighting the mega-store has great potential, but that was not seriously addressed.Did this movie do justice to the online relationship?  Other than the stars' furtive anxieties to get online without detection by their live-in partners, we really don't see the magic of getting to know new people in cyberspace.Finally, I had to wonder if Hanks and Ryan are too old for this movie -- not too old for romance, but too old for the unexplained love-before-first-sight theme.  I wonder if an opportunity was squandered to make a more mature romantic comedy.  They were surrounded by shallow relationships, including their own live-in temps, and Joe Fox's father's and grandfather's caricatures, and framed by this unexplained cyber-love.  We are left to assume that these folks have found something deeper -- but not really told how or why.

Shame on these 90's writers that unfittingly force these racial stereotypes into their works for cheap laughs from upper/middle class America.  Amos and Andy, Buckwheat, Jimmy (J.J.)

James Stewart is a favorite of mine but Sullavan was disagreeable and I despised her.

The love story is very sweet and although it's not flawless, in the original I couldn't find a single good thing about Sullavan's character and found myself very angry when she said she had been mean to Stewart simply because ""I'd just finished a novel about a glamorous French actress. When she wanted to arouse a man's interest, she treated him like a dog.

Therein lies the problem... There were many ways she could've made this a better script like Mommy and Daddy's _Desk Set_.The heroine owns a little bookstore that was her mom's. WHY is she buying her coffee at STARBUCKS?!?!?! That's the BIG corporate bully. She's not practicing what she wants others to practice in order to keep her business alive. You've got to buy coffee from a place that has REAL baristas and not someone who presses buttons. There are a lot of coffee houses in NYC that treat every cup like a work of art. Ephron should've had her going to those stores and articulating the importance of keeping those places in business.Also, I would've respected the heroine A LOT MORE if she read _Pride and Prejudice_ for what it is. Tom Hanks' character, Joe Fox, made fun of the heroine for reading _Pride and Prejudice_. Meg Ryan's character, Kathleen Kelly ?, could've shown her literary prowess by responding that it's not a shallow, girly romance avec wonderful brooding Darcy, but Austen's social commentary of the day.

334,dannimac,A love letter to New York,9,1 June 2003,"This is a simple rom-com for those of us who don't want a heavy duty thinking session. Hanks and Ryan are great in their respective roles and are supported by a wonderful cast. The plot is fairly simple and is based on the plot of The Shop Around the Corner where two ""enemies"" don't realise that they are each others pen pals (in the original by mail, in this one by email) and fall in love with their secret pen pal only to find out later that their true love has been right under their nose. A little cheesy maybe but like I said, this isn't heavy duty. Apart from the central love story, there are two other love stories going on here and good on the Ephron sisters for bringing them up. The first one is a love of the printed word. Whether your choice would be Fox Books or The Shop Around the Corner, both are bringing a love of books to the target audience. And even though the Frank Navasky character is not the most endearing, he loves the words that he writes. But the most important love story of all is the love that Nora Ephron has for New York, especially the community of the Upper West Side. The UWS is truly the star of the movie and deservedly so.

It is a righteous two-hour romantic comedy that plays almost similar to a mellow sitcom.

Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan still have their proper roots to make this worth sitting on a loveseat with Kleenexes., even if two of their worlds don't exactly collide.

This woman is truly miserable but suddenly as if she realises there's not long left in the movie her entire mod changes.

While the movie starts well, though, Joe Fox, the character played by Tom Hanks, is too large a jerk to make Meg's love for him close to believable.  Maybe the problem is that most of his charming e-mails are things we read early in the movie; by the end, he's spent a fair amount of their on-line time giving her business advice based on the Godfather.  (Mattress-talk, as it were, but not pillow-talk.)  It is also remarkable, and unfathomable, that at no point does she express anger with the fact that he has known who she is in non-virtual life for months and has led her on in e-mail as though he still didn't know her.  That might not be unforgivable, but wouldn't it at least inspire a flash of anger, not a kiss?  Maybe that is supposed to be what happens after the movie ends, but it would have been more sensible if she'd been outraged for just a few seconds. . . .Lastly, I found several things ironic.  I was watching the movie in my small town in a (chain-owned) movie theater located between a local bookstore and the newly-arrived national chain bookstore.

358,bigunit94,You gotta pay attention,10,31 May 2000,"This is my first comment here so I have decided to comment on a film that has received very mixed reviews. A few despise it, a few hail it as a classic, and the majority either find it decent or below average. Massive SPOILERS BABY, WATCH OUT! Anyway, I have seen all or the majority of this film about 6 times at least, either on HBO or on our copy on video. And it gets better and makes more sense each time I see it.First I am gonna set some facts straight (people who havent seen it stop now).  I am going to try an explain many of the things people obviously didnt get. Now some people have serious issues with this film, and some people are inserting points in the story that dont exist, like one reviewer saying ""Her life gets oh-so much better after he has clobbered her book shop and gives her a job at his big phallic megamart"". Now if you actually PAID ATTENTION you would know that after she is closed down she becomes a Childrens book author, which is right up her alley. It would be great if she could keep her store and its still very sad that dream is gone but becoming a childrens book author is just as much of dream for her, one that she never expected to realize.This is what I mean by paying attention folks. Just about everyone (especially us men) had a preconceived notion that this film is just innoucous fluff and doesnt require much attention to enjoy. And they have ended up missing half the film and not even getting the facts right. And if you dont pay attention to this film you could end up really not liking it.Joe is not a remorseless businessman at heart ever, he feels remorse at when he zings an enemy (he explains that early on while emailing Shopgirl, and Shopgirl on the other hand desires to aquire some of that zing that Joe has since she is so wholesome that she cant come up with zingers all that quickly). His motto of ""its not personal, its business"" is his way of reassuring himself and ignoring his concience. The only time he is ever really mean to Kathleen is the scene early on at the little convention. Well before he knew Shopgirl was Kathleen. And after that is when confides to Shopgirl the remorse he feels over those comments and that side of his personality in general (mentioned in parentheses above).  A few people were creeped out by Tom Hanks actions, and there was no reason to be. One guy even compared it to stalking, which is sooooo way off I wont dignify it with a response, except that he definatly paid no attnetion.NY152 technically never stood her up, and Kathleen figures that out at the end. The writers had two options when they meet in the cafe the first time, He could have come clean there or shortly thereafter or they could go the direction they did. I'm sure the writers considered the other option. But it would make things very muddled. Kathleen would have a very difficult choice, with the personality ""NY152"" she adores so much belonging the seemingly cold and heartless Joe Fox would very easily be enough for her to give up on ""NY152"" altogether and move on. And what kind of movie would that make? I can understand why Joe withheld that info in the cafe, He was coming to terms with all of this himself, the persona he adores online being the same person he is putting out of business. His business just became very personal. And she has no idea. From the moment Joe finds out ""Shopgirl"" is Kathleen he contemplates giving up on the whole thing. But he goes in and talks to her as Joe Fox. And he finds out how deep her dislike of Joe is (she is finally able to put together the mean words she wants to). Of course he is hurt that this woman who is so cold to him is the same woman he anonymously adores.Its the little chat with dad in the boat that convinces Joe to pursue the relationship. In fact its the final line of that chat which does, and its very easy to miss. Right in the next scene Joe visits her at her apartment. And This scene is pivotal. When he first shows up she resists his charm and is still rather cold to him. But now she realizes what NY152 was talking about earlier when they talked about saying exactly what you want to say when confronted with an enemy. So she tries to not be so cold to him, though she still thinks he is slime. During this scene Joe turns on the charm and starts to reveal that he is not such a bad guy (which we already knew) and he is remorseful about what has occured. They learn a fews things during this scene. The rest of the film up to the end is basically the two of them becoming friends. When NY152 tells shopgirl he has a project he is ""tweaking"" he means he is trying to be friends with Kathleen, which even he had said himself was almost impossible but if they connected so well over the internet there is no major reason to not connect as well in real life, except for the one hurdle. At the end of the Apartment scene Joe hints quite a bit at the internet relationship without giving it away. Kathleen begins to suspect I think. And this is what warms her up to him, is the similaritys between him and NY152. A late line by Joe sums it up, where he says NY152 is waiting for Kathleen to be primed, so that she is convinced that NY152 is ""the guy"". In fact he is partially talking about himself becoming friends with her so she is more receptive to him. He did NOT manipulate her. He simply tried and succeeded to become friends with her simply as Joe Fox. Well thats enough for now, I have practically transcribed scenes to help some of the more ignorant critics. In short I liked this movie at first, and I love it now.  I liked Sleepless and I like lighter romantic comedies in general (though I dont like the Julia Robert's romantic comedies, I dont care for her in general). This one may be my favorite though. A very interesting, well paced (people who thought it was slow werent paying enough attention) and definatly cutesy and sweet but excellant nonetheless and a step above Sleepless in Seattle IMO.",You've Got Mail

It is however still a really good movie to snuggle on the couch with a box chocolates to.I loved the coincidences and the laughter, that the one person who Meg Ryan gives her heart to over the internet, is the person who destroys her life's work, The Shop Around the Corner, but ultimately frees her to do something more worthwhile - writing childrens stories.Tom Hanks is brilliant as always, his boyish charm at war with the hard business man he is, although the charm and laughter are what ultimately Meg's character falls for.Altogether a very nice movie, good characters and well written.

The movie tells you about the possibilities and the fantasy which we can embark on, of course you feel a vacuum in yourself that you hardly have even a minimal chance to encounter this in your life. The movie could be a remake of 'Shop around the Corner' that I have not seen, but it matches with the times we are living today.Tom Hanks or Meg Ryan need no introduction, they exemplified the character. Very simple dialogues, a very clean script, and a very decent movie that can be viewed with your family.  Being an Indian and brought up in a conservative environment, I was quite surprised that are English movies made like this.  I Thank Director Nora for making such lively movies.People are always confronted with moments that you are quite inexplicable and I am not able to explain myself, all I can say is Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan have given such commendable performance, that you forget the world around you and wish to rerun the movie.Just view the movie it is worth it.",You've Got Mail

Cool, i thought.No... not cool: AMAZING. Norah Efron has just a gift. This movie isn't just another chick flick story.

The movie can fresh the viewers mind with its sweet sense, though still there is some questions. Ain't it a little bit awkward that Joe is giving the clues that he is the same person who got mail from the girl constantly, but the girl thinks her silver lining is somewhere else.

375,uterjelf,Has What So Many Romantic Comedies Lack: A Heart,7,7 July 2013,"Romantic Comedy is a genre that has really tapered off in the last decade or so. The genre has become so dependent on sex, for both the romance and comedy, that watching such a sincere film as ""You've Got Mail"" makes you realize how sweet and funny movies of this type can be.The film centers around Joe Fox (Tom Hanks), owner of a book superstore ""Fox Books"", and Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan), owner of a small mom and pop bookstore ""The Shop Around the Corner"". Bitter business rivals by day but, unbeknownst to them, anonymous e-mail pen pals by night. Naturally of course they fall in love with each other through the e-mails despite a strict ""no personal information"" pact. The film uses this setup to use dramatic irony for many of the jokes but also for character development.The key to romance in fiction, comedy or not, is to make it about characters and their relationships with each other. The best romances (""When Harry Met Sally..."", ""The Notebook"", ""Whisper of the Heart"", and even pieces of ""Welcome to the NHK"") develop themselves around their characters. But what this type of film needs more than anything but so rarely does is heart and to believe in its characters and events. This is how ""You've Got Mail"" succeeds, it makes itself about the characters. So while not a deep film, by doing that it allows itself to be sweet, funny, and believable. Funny and romantic (what a movie in a genre called Romantic Comedy should be), ""You've Got Mail"" is such a nice little film that even us cynics at heart can't help but smile.",You've Got Mail

And definitely didn't need my tissues.  I sat there, staring blankly at the screen. Following along with the plot, but just not enjoying it as I thought I would. Maybe my hopes were too high. The only part of the movie that really even got anywhere close to actually ""getting to me"" was the end. We all knew it was gonna be Tom Hanks that she was meeting, but for some reason we were all surprised. And we all wanted so badly ""for it to be him"". And it was. And I just almost cried.

For a start, You've Got Mail has a decent ending: 'Sleepless' (if I remember rightly) did not reward us so well.On the lead up to that final scene however we see a brilliantly paced, delightfully funny story with characters that were pleasantly believable. Tom Hanks, in a subtle kind of way, was a lot more on form than he was in Sleepless in Seattle and as for Meg Ryan, all I can say is she was wonderful.For me, everything was perfect: great story, great performances, romantic highs and touching lows... needless to say I was tremendously impressed by this film which I feel so far hasn't demanded the respect it so truly deserves.",You've Got Mail

Unfortunately I found some mood sketches slightly dragging the plot in the first half of the film. And in the second half we get to witness the complete downfall of ""the Shop around the Corner"".

416,Opusaug,It's not brain surgery,9,15 February 1999,"If you're expecting intellectualisms, you should be reading books, like this movie's central characters.  The fact that you're not means you're sitting in the movie theater hoping to be entertained - and this movie does just that.Hanks reprises the role he plays in many of his other movies, as a man most men would like to be, or hope to be if the subject matter isn't as pleasant as ""Saving Miss Ryan"".  His ability to be ""everyman"" without being ""any man"" is what keeps his rent paid year after year.The real gem however, is Meg Ryan (again), who once more dominates the screen with her patented quirky smiles, and that enthusiastic projection empathy that can drag you kicking and screaming into whatever her emotion of the moment might be.My opinion of Ryan over Hanks isn't to diminish the undeniable interaction this couple seems to share in their movies.  It's just the plain, hard fact that I'll never leave one of Tom's performances hoping I've mistakenly stumbled into the premiere and just happen to bump into him on the way out. Meg Ryan is definitely underrated as one of America's best female leads. No, she tends not to stretch herself, and note that I didn't say ""best actresses"".  But she is apparently smart enough to know a good thing when she sees it, so if her characters tend to look and act alike, it's a cross I'll bear to spend 120 minutes with her every few months.Unfortunately, in the debaucherous 90's, the girl-next-door image Ryan portrays onscreen (like her perfect parallel in Hank's Joe Yuppie) is seen by too many people as simplistic and overplayed in its NutraSweet way.

""You've Got Mail"" is a wonderful movie that is perfect for those looking for love, and those in love.  It gives us hope that we can find that perfect someone, no matter how unrealistic it might seem. Meg Ryan is her lovable self.  We can't help but feel sorry for her predicament, and sympathize with her even as she is being mean and insensitive to Joe Fox (Tom Hanks).  Although not her best performance, there is still plenty to enjoy.  One can only laugh as she tries to talk with a ""stubbed up node..."" Tom Hanks is the perfect mix of being a serious business man on one hand, and a caring, compassionate friend on the other.  He's the ""villain"" in this movie, but a more likable villain I've never encountered, or cheered for! ""You've Got Mail"" does a good job of setting up the story of the corporate giant superstore taking over the small independently owned shops. Where it truly shines, however, is when we are treated to the interactions between Hanks & Ryan.  We laugh at all the things hinted at, while we know what is truly going on.I was thankful that the computers on screen were kept to a minimum. We weren't subjected to a lot of technobabble, keeping it to Email and a chat room.  After all, it is far more interesting to have characters talking to each other than to have them thinking about what they are writing (which was done rather well in this film).Sure, it is virtually (no pun intended) impossible for something like this to happen (no one can REALLY get online with AOL in less than 10 tries!)

Then, there are people who make a huge list of factual errors that they found in the movie. Duh, it is just a light-hearted feel-good comedy - you don't go to a war movie or a biopic expecting to have a laugh-riot, do you? You need to look at each movie in its own context. Sometimes, people are paying so much attention to detail that they do not get the big picture.It is not a cheesy chick-flick with people touching and kissing and cuddling and too much gallantry. It is smart, witty and well-packaged comedy. This is one of the reasons why many guys, including me, love it.In fact, so many guys love this movie that I feel that this movie and the director need special mention. I think it is a great achievement by the director. Lets think of it this way - imagine some gaming company coming up with a great first person shooter game that most of the women like to play. Hard to imagine, right! I think getting a huge percentage of men to like a rom-com is an equally challenging task and this movie has done it.I have seen many friends of mine who have turned to Meg Ryan's fans for life after watching this movie - I am speaking of guys who always hated rom-coms before (most of them still do hate rom-coms).I would recommend everyone to buy this movie - it is for keepers.

Tom Hanks has the most expressive face of any actor, his eyes tell more than a diatribe. Dabney Coleman plays his role as his usual smarmy self, and nobody does it better.

She may be the only actress her age in the history of film to so completely revert to adolescence and get away with it, but get away with it she does.As the protagonists' relationship develops online and in real life, the viewer is drawn deeper into their lives, rooting them on in their quest for love and happiness, even as we realize the inevitability of success.",You've Got Mail

The plot loosely follows the movie Shop Around the Corner and Kathleen Kelly's (Ryan) shop is named Shop Around the Corner. It's especially interesting that Pride and Prejudice is mentioned in the movie. Joe Fox (Hanks) comments that he can't ever remember if it's Mr. Darcy that is too prideful or too prejudice.

A beautiful garden, two foes turning into lovers, a happy ending with a twist. Meg Ryan is perfect for this role, her meek persona combined with her innocent look brings to life Kelly's character. It wouldn't be a 90's love story without Tom Hanks, who brings an undeniable charm and arrogance to his character. This movie is up there with the classics of my generation (i.e When Harry Met Sally, Sleepless in Seattle, Pretty Woman,etc.). I remember when this movie came out, it played on the Chat Rooms that had recently gained so much popularity, not to mention AOL's famous line ""You've Got Mail"" which still plays almost a decade later. It makes fun of modern society with its new fashioned attraction to massive monopolistic companies that overtake the simplistic charming businesses that dwell below. It has a witty humor about it that makes it so appealing, its this coupled with the ""will they or wont they"" theme that is so common in most 90's love stories that makes this film a classic.

443,kewlie24,The plot of 'You've Got Mail' is based on that of a 1949 movie starring Judy Garlan and Van Johnson titled 'In The Good Old Summertime',10,27 December 2007,"I really enjoyed 'You've Got Mail'. I am a very big fan of the Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan pair. It's quite a good romantic/comedic duo. And just the other day I came across a movie titled 'In The Good Old Summertime' playing on TurnerClassicMovies. I sat down and proceeded to watch this seemingly interesting movie. And it was very interesting.The movie follows the story of Van Johnson's character, Andrew 'Andy' Larkin, and Judy Garland's character, Veronica Fisher. Unbeknownst to the two after a run-in on the street, they are secret pen pal lovers. Neither knows of the other's identity, and when Veronica comes to work at Andy's place of business, all havoc breaks loose. At first, Andy and Veronica hate each other, but when they two pen pals decide to meet for a date, Andy gets his friend to peek through the window to scope out his soon-to-be bride-to-be. It happens almost exactly like the scene with Dave Chappelle and Tom Hanks in 'You've Got Mail. But when his friend relays that his date is in fact Miss Fisher, Andy is floored, yet slightly intrigued. He then proceeds to have some fun, and walks into the café. The scene in 'You've Got Mail' where the guy asks if he can take the chair happens the same way it does in the '49 movie. And when Andy is asked to leave Veronica's table, he does what Tom Hanks does and sits in the chair next to hers at the next table over. It's funny how the new mirrors the old. Minus the musical part. After her pen pal lover stands Veronica up, she remains 'sick' the next day. Andy goes to check on her and realizes that he is in love with her. It happens rather similarly to the scene in 'You've Got Mail'.It's a really quirky movie that inspires lots of laughs. Really, I recommend it.",You've Got Mail

However, in one of the last scenes, when Kathleen is leaving her apartment building to meet NY152, she has no key to get back into the front door of her apartment building. She's carrying no purse, wallet, etc., she's wearing now chain around her neck, and the outfit she is wearing (a lavender sweater set with gore pleated skirt) has no pockets! Where is her key? It could be argued that she pinned it in her to an undergarment, but that could prove embarrassing. How will she get back into her building? Better call the super! Other than that small detail, the movie is very very good.",You've Got Mail
445,blueviolets-rebekah,One of the Best Romantic Comedies ever!!!!!,10,2 September 2007,"You've Got Mail is probably the best romantic comedy I've ever seen. It's smart funny, and romantic. The acting is top-notch, what with Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks playing the lead roles. Tom and Meg have such a wonderful chemistry on screen; and they are both so cute! All the other actors are cute and funny too! The story is original and ironic. It tells the story of two people who fall in love online but hate each other in the real world. The music is GREAT, featuring fun and groovy soft rock that adds so much to the movie. Probably the best part about this movie is it's ending. It's the most romantic ending ever, it's so touching and funny and makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. That's the only way I can describe it, but it's so much better that that! If you love romantic comedies or even if you don't, Watch You've Got Mail!!!! You'll love it!",You've Got Mail

It's the only movie I could sign with my handwriting how a man is represented towards a woman.Tom Hanks must feel very comfortable. I always looked for a movie where man and woman learn to know each other before they kiss or do other crazy things. Of all movies and scenes I've seen it's the only movie where it takes place. Thats why i saw this movie 12 times and would see it even more often at my friends. At home I have no TV. Anyway the movie heals my heart from a real love that didn't work. That's just the reason why I watch movies with Meg Ryan. Otherwise I watch James Bond ""Tomorrow never dies"" when I feel strong again . Sincerely YoursDaniel Messinger",You've Got Mail

448,patpolidoro,Be careful,7,14 December 2007,"Well, I'm here because I'm doing an English course and they asked me to write on this space of Internet... We saw a part from this movie and then I saw it full at my home. I have to write here to express my opinion about it. After I saw this movie, I think I must be more careful than I am about Internet. Because Tom Hanks was a business neighbor of Meg. If he wanted he could take advantage of that situation to drive Meg to break her business. But it's very romantic, a very funny movie. And after I search for more information about this movie I found this ""You've Got Mail is an American romantic comedy released in 1998 by Warner Brothers. It is a remake of the film The Shop Around the Corner (1940), in which two letter-writing lovers are completely unaware that their sweetheart is in fact the co-worker with whom they share a certain degree of animosity. There was also a 1949 musical remake (In the Good Old Summertime) starring Judy Garland. You've Got Mail updates that concept to the use of e-mail. The name of the film is the greeting that American AOL users hear when they receive new e-mail. The film received significant media coverage leading up to its release in anticipation of the romantic coupling of Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan, who had appeared together previously in Joe vs. The Volcano (1990) and Sleepless in Seattle (1993).""",You've Got Mail
449,kathykc,I love the actors!,9,4 March 2008,"I have always been fond of both of the main characters in this movie. Meg Ryan has that sweet girl next door thing about her while at the same time being quite sexy and funny. Tom Hanks is one of my favorite leading men from that time frame. While I don't think he's that high on sex appeal, he is sincere, believable and quite funny. The supporting cast is also quite good in my opinion. I was surprised to see Jean Stapleton, but as always I thought her role was perfect for the movie. What a treat to actually see Dave Chappelle in a movie. I just love his brand of comedy. Dabney Coleman was another surprise. Where had he been prior to this? It had been quite a while since I had seen him. All in all, I really appreciated the cast and the wonderful roles they played in this movie. A must see if you haven't already!",You've Got Mail

It almost seemed like they were trying for another sappy ""Sleepless in Seattle."" If that's what you are looking for, then you did come to the right place.

453,kepsstar,Review based on genre,10,28 November 2011,"When someone watches a romance movie, they expect sappy love lines, difficulties in the relationship, and a happy ending. You've Got Mail (1998) with director Nora Ephron has all of that and more. Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks play as Kathleen Kelly and Joe Fox, both book store owners. They meet online, anonymous, and start emailing. It creates a charming love story where the star players don't know they have been chosen.The director knows what they are doing. We see Kelly and Fox as people that do the same kind of things every day and could possibly have become the best of friends, if only their books stores weren't competing. That is what makes this film completely unique. They would both wake up awaiting emails from each other, and going to bed safe in the knowledge that there will be an email when they wake up. When they meet in person they get alone perfectly fine, till the information that he is the head boss of Fox's Book store. A big chain of book stores everywhere, putting Kelly's little Shop Around The Corner out of business.Most people nowadays believe that email is old fashioned and slow, but it suited them just fine. Nice fairly long emails let them be honest with each other with no personal details. They fell in love with each other using only their personality traits, that is another reason his film is so unique. Normally, when we meet someone, we see their clothes, hairstyle, face, as things scoring or losing points for them. These things did not stand in Kelly and Fox's way as they do others.You've Got Mail is a sweet, funny romance that has a lot of charming moments in it. It is a must see for someone who prides themselves on seeing romance movies. It holds all the key factors, and has je ne sais quoi. It gives you those good little tingles all over when you watch it. You never know what exactly will happen next, or what someone will say. It brings alive that dream of that special someone that fills your heart with joy, for you.",You've Got Mail

Last fall I was watching and I noticed what I perceive to be a ghostly figure. If you are reading this your probably own the movie. Go get it and put it in your DVD player. I'll wait .... Okay go to the scene where Kathleen is leaving the store for the last time. She's dragging her right hand on the counter. In the very next scene a figure can be seen going from left to right in what I think is a mirror to the right of the front door. If the mirror is actually a window then you would expect to see the image cross the front door first. Watch it over and over and please tell me what you think.

457,Mitsurugi,Two hours of my life I won't get back,1,9 June 2004,"There are any number of films which I can say that, on an objective level are far worse than this film: 'Bloody Murder', any of the 'Friday the Thirteenth' franchise and any number of godawful action flicks all have pathetic production values, dreadful acting, cruddy scripts and no characterisation. However I hate this film with a passion that goes beyond my contempt for the aforementioned.This is possibly the dullest film I've ever seen in my life.Film is one of the most exciting, vibrant media for the telling of stories it can be compelling, immediate and breathtaking, or intimate and subtle.You've got M@il manages to kick the life out of the medium, but wearing pillows on it's feet so it takes a long time.Those two hours stretched on into eternity and because it was my future father-in-law subjecting me to it, I couldn't just say turn it off, please make it stop. It wasn't just me that hated it. My wife does too.I think the overwhelming problem with the movie is that I cared about the characters as much as I would about the bland, faceless ciphers that get torn apart in horror flicks i.e. not at all. In fact a hockey-masked maniac tearing them apart would have raised a cheer. Anything to add a little colour.The script wasn't up to the standard of a good TV sitcom.Dull, smug, self satisfied twaddle.I could go on like this for hours and you wouldn't scratch how badly this film scarred me. Hell is indeed other people, if they're Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan (and a Nora Ephron marathon on infinite repeat in the background)",You've Got Mail

461,gregbern-52871,"Unlike ""84 Charing Cross Road""",6,4 November 2015,"Unlike ""84 Charing Cross Road"" the writing (of letters) is largely incidental, and the real plot is 'will they get it together?' This of course means there is no suspense since in movies of this type the couple always gets it together. And so it is. This is apparently a remake of some earlier Hollywood hit and follows the romantic comedy formula perfectly, even down to the protagonists' compulsory best friends.The script is by Norah Ephron, and she does raise a laugh on occasion. When Tom Hanks introduces the children he is with to Meg Ryan, it turns out the 7 year old girl is his aunt and the 9 year old is his brother, the products of late second marriages by his father and grandfather (both still alive). ""A typical American family"" says Tom. I hope not - Dad and Grandad are pretty ruthless people. Recommended? Well, saw this one as an in-flight movie, so it was free.

462,vastaviktagandhi,"I found this movie randomly on my friend's laptop. He said that it is a romantic movie. And boy, what a romantic movie it was! Beautiful.",9,24 October 2015,"You've Got Mail 1998The main characters are Kathleen Kelly played by Meg Ryan and Joe Fox played by Tom Hanks. The movie takes us back to the time when the internet was a new thing. New and generating sparks of curiosity. Kathleen and Joe were among the people who liked the whole new idea of online chat rooms and mailing. They met each other online but decided not to share any personal details; only chatting. But in real life, both of them were business rivals. Kathleen was running a small shop of books since years, meaning, her mother used to run the shop before her. While, Joe had just started a new big and trendy book shop right across the street which ultimately led Kathleen out of business. During this whole time, online they got attached to each other even more. The tension in the movie builds up when Joe finds out the truth about his online love. He is devastated. He has no idea what to do. He loves her but knows that he is responsible for throwing her out of business and she will never accept him. The movie captures all our interest now. And the attention is worth it. The way he reveals the truth to Kathleen is the best part of the movie. Totally unpredictable, the end of the movie will bring you to tears. Before starting, I must tell you that I watched this movie in the year 2015. So, usually when I watch a movie from '90's I find the dressing of characters really bad. Fortunately, the characters here are so interesting and well defined, also the acting is carried out so well that you don't mind the dresses. Meg Ryan looks beautiful in the movie. I am not sure if I find Tom Hanks handsome. But, I love him in the movie. Brilliant acting. The movie starts out slow and for teenagers like me, will need a bit of patience. Trust me, it's worth it (esp. if you are a romantic). The point where the two characters are at war with each other in the real life, I was worried. Because, they had decided online that they will not reveal their personal details. Hats off to the script writer here, wonderful job. The mails that they send to each other are equally as interesting as the characters themselves and even in the toughest times manage not to reveal the truth about each other. So, the movie never bores you. One drawback I found was the presence of too many side characters. Like, Kathleen's current boyfriend, her two employees and her aunt. Joe's father, grandfather, girlfriend, father's wife, father's wife's daughter, grandfather's son, etc. The main thing is that all of them have at least one dialogue and not a light one. This distracts our attention from the main story. Though I think you might not mind it much. The scene director has also done a pretty good job. One of my favorite scene is the one where Kathleen sits with a wizard hat on and reads out a story for the children in the store. The movie gets a hold of you when they decide online that they will meet in person. Only the audience knows, that a disaster is following. But before both find out the truth, Joe finds out first. The thing is that Joe took the whole business thing as professional and not personal. On the other hand, it was not the same for Kelly. She was attached to her store. Joe was the reason why she has to close the store, so Joe knew that Kathleen will never accept their online love in real life. My favorite part is how Joe brings out the truth to Kathleen. Mainly because, it shows how much he loves her. It is heart touching. The ending brought me to tears and I am sure it will not disappoint you either.",You've Got Mail

This is practically the same movie as the 1940 James Stewart and Margaret Sullivan movie called ""The Shop Around the Corner."" Except it's not nearly as good. In fact, as a whole, it's terrible. And it's FUNNY that too because it is a rip off of that other film, and the other film was so good. You'd think a remake would be somewhat appealing. The 3/10 is a pity vote... I only rated that high because of Tom Hanks. I like Hanks. I also liked The Godfather references. ""Take him to the mattresses."" ""Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday."" But...It was a really unappealing film. Jimmy and Maggie might just be rolling over in their graves. I know I would. Give me the original ANY day. It was such a better film overall... You don't just get intimate with Stewart and Sullivan's characters in the movie, but you get a good taste of everyone else involved. There seems to be more depth to the minor characters. Hell, even the errand boy, who proves to be a rather vital part (as he saves the other guy from killing himself after learning that one of his employees is having an affair with his wife). There are creative and detailed subplots that entwine itself with the romance plot between Kralik (Stewart) and Novak (Sullivan). I felt that ""You've Got Mail"" was weak in that respect; it was focused too much on those two characters that everything else was overshadowed, leaving the world they were leaving in and the other characters that interact with them in this bland shade of gray.
