0,TheLittleSongbird,"If you thought Lost Highway was David Lynch at his strangest, wait until you see Wild At Heart!",7,12 October 2014,"Wild at Heart is not David Lynch at his best, personally much prefer Blue Velvet, The Elephant Man, Mulholland Drive and The Straight Story and is definitely not going to be everybody's cup of tea. But while it has its flaws Wild at Heart still impresses and fascinates in many ways, also don't think that it's his worst like some people I know in the past have said(that'd be Dune). The story does feel very randomly structured at times, especially true with Crispin Glover, and some of the pacing slackens; the film could have done with being shorter as some scenes did feel too padded and underdeveloped, and the script can be a confused jumble and not always easy to understand completely(though admittedly there are some quotable lines). There are many great things with Wild at Heart however because the cinematography is stunning, the scenery is bursting with vivid colour and there are plenty of bold colours and lighting with some of the visuals being wonderfully deranged. There is also a hypnotic soundtrack that adds so much to the feel of the film, the music choices being also quite interesting, while Lynch's direction while not the best he's ever done(tied between Blue Velvet and Mulholland Drive) but it is very adept and has his unique style all over. The story is not the best but the atmosphere is just great, just loved the campiness, the eroticism and haunting weirdness, it's hardly uneventful and there are some memorable moments like the incredibly chilling robbery sequence and the ending. The Wizard of Oz references while a little over-used are fun. The characters are not likable at all, in fact in the cases of Marietta and Bobby a few of them could be seen as loathsome, but considering the atmosphere and viciously violent but also sexy content of the film it is clear that they weren't intended to be. The performances are fine, Nicholas Cage will induce polarising opinions but while he was wooden to start with he was charming and entertaining once he warmed up. Laura Dern is alluring with the two working comfortably together, while Diana Ladd manages to be both hilarious and scary and Willem Dafoe is unforgettably creepy. The cameos acquit themselves well too. All in all, incredibly strange and not without flaws but also fascinating. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Wild at Heart
1,Leofwine_draca,Total weirdness,5,28 November 2012,"A bit of a weird one, this, but then what was I expecting from a David Lynch film? It's a surreal road movie starring Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern as a pair of star-crossed lovers on the run from Dern's demented mother and the string of assorted weirdos on their tail.I can't say I enjoyed this film all that much. I don't mind slightly crazed or surreal movies, like an earlier Nicolas Cage flick (and out-and-out comedy), RAISING ARIZONA. But WILD AT THE HEART feels like it's trying to be deliberately bad. Cage isn't in touch with reality at all in this one and Laura Dern just comes across as a bad actress.The direction is over the top throughout, with no measure of restraint on view. Lots of scenes are cheesy or just plain bad. It's not all bad, though, because we do get Willem Dafoe in an scene-stealing supporting role, and some decent set-pieces (like the bank job) along the way. But a lot of it, especially during the first hour, feels repetitive and slow, and the WIZARD OF OZ allusions are annoying more than anything.",Wild at Heart
2,SnoopyStyle,crazy....,5,9 September 2016,Marietta Fortune (Diane Ladd) sets a man off to kill her daughter Lula (Laura Dern)'s boyfriend Sailor Ripley (Nicolas Cage). Sailor manages to kill the man but he gets imprisoned for almost two years. Lula is there waiting for him when he gets released. They leave Cape Fear and his probation for New Orleans. Marietta sends Johnnie Farragut (Harry Dean Stanton) after them. She also hires gangster Marcello Santos. The couple finds Perdita Durango (Isabella Rossellini) and joins Bobby Peru (Willem Dafoe) in a robbery as they continue their road trip.This is one crazy film. I give full marks to director David Lynch for his audacity and his style. The acting is big and deliberately broad. There are fanciful allusions to Wizard of Oz and other imagery. This is an unique Lynch vision. The craziness in the characters and story simply overwhelm me at some point. I couldn't take the insanity.,Wild at Heart
3,gavin6942,Lynch and Cage,6,13 July 2017,"Young lovers Sailor (Nicolas Cage) and Lula (Laura Dern) run from the variety of weirdos that Lula's mom (Diane Ladd) has hired to kill Sailor.Early test screenings for the film did not go well; Lynch estimated that 80 people walked out of the first test screening and 100 in the next. At the time of its release, the film received mixed critical reviews and was a moderate success at the box office, grossing $14 million, above its $10 million budget. The film won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, at which it received both negative and positive attention from its audience. Diane Ladd was nominated for Best Supporting Actress for both the Academy Awards and the Golden Globes. It has since received some positive re-evaluation from critics.I can certainly understand the reactions to this film. It is weird, and not just David Lynch weird. The blend of Elvis and ""Wizard of Oz"" is strange. I also understand the re-evaluation, given how Lynch has become something of a giant in the film world (not to mention Cage really blowing up in the 1990s). I don't know if this is anyone's favorite Lynch film, but it probably isn't anyone's least favorite.",Wild at Heart
4,lee_eisenberg,"""The Wizard of Oz"" meets Elvis Presley",10,7 February 2018,"David Lynch, that master of the bizarre, strikes again with ""Wild at Heart"". What I interpreted from it is that, no matter how weird a person is, s/he isn't as weird as the society that we inhabit. After all, Sailor is seen as the ""wrong"" kind of person for Lula, but the people hired by Marietta are also some real oddballs. Indeed, Sailor may have killed someone, but Marietta turns out to be the only truly creepy character: not only does she want to control Lula's life, but the way that she covers her entire face in lipstick is outright scary. And Bobby? Now that man's enough to make your skin crawl!If you want to take a more cynical approach to this, you could say that Lynch gave it the ending that audiences want as opposed to a more shocking one. But in reality, after what the movie says about our society, don't the protagonists deserve each other's love? Whether challenging the notion of an idealistic small town, or focusing on some sick people in the generally unseen parts of the US, this is not a movie that you're likely to forget soon. Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern put on what were probably the best performances of their careers, with fine support from Diane Ladd, Harry Dean Stanton (RIP), Willem Dafoe, Crispin Glover, Isabella Rossellini and Sherilyn Fenn.Not the best movie ever made, but one that all cinephiles should watch at least once.",Wild at Heart
5,jboothmillard,Wild at Heart,8,16 August 2006,"From director David Lynch, this film (along with The Elephant Man and Blue Velvet) makes more sense than many of his others, and is really good. It is all about Nicolas Cage as Sailor, the film pretty much starts with the explanation for the title, when he murders a black man. 20 or so years later he is released and is reunited with his true love, Lula (Laura Dern). This film has quite a few flashbacks with both characters, and you kind of have to pay attention to them, but Lula's Mum character is one of the nastiest and most unusual stories of the film. In real life Cage is an Elvis fan, and the character having a real enthusiasm about him is really important to the story, especially at the very end. The ending is the best part, besides when Bobby Peru (Willem Dafoe) blows his head off, when he is beaten up by thugs he calls homosexuals, he waken up by The Wizard of Oz's good fairy, and he runs back to Lula, and he sings a fantastic version of Elvis's ""Love Me Tender"", it was quite emotional. Also starring J.E. Freeman as Santos, Back to the Future's Crispin Glover as Dell, Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Diane Ladd as the horrible Marietta Fortune, Calvin Lockhart as Reggie, Isabella Rossellini as Perdita and Harry Dean Stanton as Johnnie Farragut. It was nominated the BAFTA for Best Sound. Nicolas Cage was number 33 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Very good!",Wild at Heart
6,ccthemovieman-1,In A Word: Outrageous!,8,7 January 2006,"Outrageous! This is another sick-but-fascinating David Lynch film, maybe his sickest, although I've never seen Eraserhead. The most interesting feature of this strange movie, I think, was the weird characters, one after the other. Make that ultra-weird.....and the strangest of them all is ""Bobby Peru,"" played by Willem Dafoe. In all my years of movie watching, I think ""Bobby Peru"" still has to rank in the top five of the creepiest characters. He is so outrageously disgusting and perverted you just have to laugh out loud at him.In fact, ""outrageous"" might be the best word to describe this film, characters and all.This wild and entertaining film sometimes makes me shake my head in disgust that I own it, and at other times makes me just laugh out loud at the absurdity of it. You really have to have a dark sense of humor to appreciate much of it. I do, to some degree....enough to keep viewing this.Nicholas Cage is particularly fun to watch and provides most of the laughs. Laura Dern is also convincing as a trailer-trash-type. If you want a clue on why Dern would play such a sleazy role, check out her real-life mom in this film, Diane Ladd, who plays her mother in the movie. It looks like Mom passed on her wholesome values.As with some other Lynch films, the music is outstanding: just a great soundtrack. I bought the CD to this a year after first seeing the movie, and I've always enjoyed it. And, another Lynch trait that certainly is here is the excellent visual style, which is enhanced by the widescreen DVD.So, if you are looking for an outrageous two hours and you aren't easily shocked or offended, this would be a film to consider.",Wild at Heart
7,Tweekums,A twisted road movie from David Lynch,8,27 August 2019,"Two years after being imprisoned for manslaughter Sailor Ripley is paroled and reunited with girlfriend Lula Fortune... much to her mother, Marietta's, disgust. The pair decide to head to California, stopping off in New Orleans on the way. Marietta her boyfriend, a private detective try to find Lula and Sailor, she also contacts gangster Marcello Santos to kill Sailor. As Sailor and Lula drive across the country they encounter some disturbing sights such as the aftermath of an horrific car crash and as they talk they learn key details about each other's pasts. Eventually the pair end up in a small Texan town where they meet Bobby Peru; a creepy individual who torments Lula and tries to persuade Sailor to join him in an armed robbery.As one might expect from a David Lynch film this is pretty weird at times, and very violent at times. The weirdness involves frequent references to 'The Wizard of Oz', Sailor singing Elvis songs and an array of disturbingly odd characters. The violence is shocking rather than glamourized; the aftermath of the car crash is disturbing but nothing compared to a character literally blowing his head off with a shotgun! The cast does a fine job with Nicolas Cage being on fine, over-the-top form as Sailor and Laura Dern being solid as Lula. The rest of the cast, which includes several David Lynch regulars also impress; making distinctly odd characters believable. Overall I'd say this certainly won't be for everybody as the weirdness often tips into the disturbing and potential offensive; however if you enjoy the films of David Lynch I'd say it is a must see.",Wild at Heart
8,moonspinner55,"For once, David Lynch's nightmarish visions repulse instead of fascinate...",2,10 September 2005,"David Lynch's films, although unsettling (intentionally) and occasionally off-putting, are usually very exciting to watch. He's such a visceral filmmaker, with an uncanny grasp of bringing personal nightmares right out into the daylight, that it sets an audience off. Viewers are immediately taken aback, and it takes a while to get used to his rhythm all over again whenever a new picture of his comes out. But ""Wild at Heart"" isn't even much of an attempt, and there's nothing gossamer or delicate about it, nothing mysterious; it seems to have been made by a truck driver, barreling his way through a traffic jam. Lynch's penchant for in-your-face vulgarity reaches its zenith; in fact, this is just vulgar bravado in search of a movie, with characters that are like fingernails raking a chalkboard. Lynch transposes ""fairy tale"" elements onto a mostly-familiar lovers-on-the-run story with Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern playing the sweethearts, anti-heroes trying to evade Dern's mother (the degraded Diane Ladd) but, alas, leaving havoc in their wake. Overlong and crummy-looking, the film is twisted, foul-mouthed...and yet much worse, it is debased. It's another chapter in Lynch's fascination with the classes (trailer-trash life vs. suburbia), with the requisite desert psychos and doomed Lolitas, but I found it incredibly repetitive and not all that wild. * from ****",Wild at Heart
9,Quinoa1984,Wild at Heart has some memorable moments in this good Lynch movie,9,26 July 2005,"A filmmaker, in particular a surrealist like David Lynch, has to be kind of careful with the way he makes his films, so that all of the abstract images and set-pieces and little moments in the stranger-than-life stories he makes can bring some awe or amazement to the viewer. He has done this in the past wonderfully with Eraserhead (his most disturbing movie to me) and Mulholland Drive, as well to a degree with Blue Velvet. With Wild at Heart, his second adaptation of a novel, he brings to the screen some moments that stick in your head, but some of them aren't really the kind that strike me crazy like with some of his other films. For example (and I have a feeling this might be part Lynch, part novelist Barry Gifford, but I'm not sure) he laces in a sort of subtext with the Wizard of Oz, as the two (anti) heroes of the film, Sailor and Lula (Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern) keep on seeing images of them. It's an effective image the first time, but working it into the plot makes it a little ridiculous; I knew that the film was part pulp-fantasy, yet with the climax including a small speech from Glenda the Good witch to Sailor, it's very unfulfilled. It brought the film to a close with melodrama, but it left nothing mysterious, nothing that usually has me floored by Lynch in not explaining where these people will go. There are also other abstractions at times that go a little too overboard, a little too clever for Lynch's own good.These gripes aside, Wild at Heart is quite the entertainer, a sort of romantic exploitation picture that fuses elements from 1950's cinema (Elvis, rock and roll, cool cars) and gives its audience what it wants for the better part of two hours. The basic premise involves two young people, played Cage and Dern, who are very well matched, as Cage gives a believable turn with half-hammed up, half sincere attitude, and Dern giving one of her best so far. They meet each other and can't keep their hands or minds off of each other, eloping constantly throughout the film. But there are problems from the start- Sailor has just been released from prison, with a dark past, and can be a very violent person. Lula's mother, Marietta (Diane Ladd in one of two very twisted performances in the film), can't stand Lula's choice, and will stop at nothing to see that Sailor doesn't get her, including hiring strong-men and a hit-man (Harry Dean Stanton) to track them down. Along the way, they run into some mishaps, and bad people (one being Willem Dafoe, the other twisted performance) as a lurid figure in the third act.There has been a lot written about the violence in the film, which is in fact very over-the-top (almost in an Oliver Stone NBK way, but done in Lynch's own style of course). It's not offensive, but it isn't as if its entertaining. It's just, well, there, and it does work to fit into the story. What one can criticize is, like with the other abstractions I mentioned before, it leaves one a little empty or feeling out-of-place. The violence has to be there, there's no question about that, and it is in an exaggerated form of the obviously fake violence in the 1950's road movies. But it takes itself so not seriously, it's hard to take it into account with the rest of the story. There's a sense of some realism in the film, but I don't know if Lynch knows at times how to combat it with his surrealism. Still, this isn't to say he hasn't made a good film, he has: it contains a lot of his wit, a lot of flashes of great use of color, used expressively like the painter he is, and it does blend much of the time as an art film-cum-drive-in flick, and it contains some of the sexiest scenes Lynch has filmed (he seems better with sex than violence). I just wouldn't say it's one of Lynch's very best works. Maybe I'll like it more the second time, or less. As Ebert put it, this is like a Luis Bunuel film done with a Jerry Lewis re-write. I'm a big fan of Bunuel, not so much of Lewis.",Wild at Heart
10,Coventry,Lynch on the road to hell,8,12 February 2004,"The most creative and controversial director in cinema is back with a road-movie! Wild at Heart is one rough roller coaster ride and a typical Lynch-cocktail of violence, sex and of coursebizarre characters. I challenge you to find one personality in this film that could be referred to as a normal human being'. As usually, Lynch introduces a bunch of wicked individuals in his film who're all messed up in the head pretty bad. Yet, I feel like Wild at Heart might be Lynch's most accessible film (outside The Elephant Man and The Straight Story). The structure remains chronological and quite easy to follow. Unlike the previous Blue Velvet, I feel like the plot and development of Wild at Heart is a bit inferior to the wonderful photography. The greatest aspects in the screenplay are in fact the delicious side-chapters that are told without absolute necessity. Like the story about Lula's cousin Dell (Crispin Glover), the torture of Harry Dean Stanton's character and the nasty and disturbing images of a car accident the protagonists come across. These are the little sequences that truly prove Lynch's talent as a storyteller. Overall and simply put: this movie is COOL! It's a joy to watch and you really hate to love some of the offensive characters. Willem Dafoe takes the cake as Bobby Peru. His portrayal is a neat follow-up to Blue Velvet's Frank Booth. Peru is a filthy and despicable pervert with itchy-trigger-fingers! It's a damn shame he hasn't got any more screen time. Wild at Heart surely isn't the greatest masterpiece out there, but you should love it for what it is: an absurd and entertaining adventure with a couple of thought-provoking values and an extraordinary love-lesson.",Wild at Heart
11,michaelRokeefe,Desperate love on the run.,6,21 April 2000,"Director David Lynch excels at the weird magic he weaves. A love starved young woman is on the run with a paroled murderer. A psycho mother puts a private eye and a deranged hit man on their trail. Some scenes are hard to watch; and then there are those typical Lynch scenes that you still don't know what the hell you saw. Very wicked soundtrack featuring Chris Isaak and Gene Vincent.Nicolas Cage is infatuated with Elvis. Laura Dern is down right NASTY. Willem Dafoe, definitely bizarre. Diane Ladd is way over the edge. Crispin Glover is clever as a cabbage. Harry Dean Stanton always seems to be at ease being clueless. Sherilyn Fenn, a waste of beauty to play a corpse. The erotic, violent and irreverent script is what holds this cast together.
David Lynch fans get everything they could expect and then some.",Wild at Heart
12,Hey_Sweden,We got some dancin' to do!,7,25 August 2019,"Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern are commanding as a pair of lovers on the lam: Sailor Ripley, a.k.a. Elvis, and Lula Fortune, a.k.a. Marilyn. Her harridan of a mother, Marietta (Diane Ladd, Derns' real-life mom), does NOT want the two of them together, so she makes deals with characters like private investigator Johnnie Farragut (Harry Dean Stanton) and crime kingpin Santos (J.E. Freeman) to track the youngsters down. Meanwhile, Sailor and Lula have a variety of surreal encounters on the road, meeting people like the depraved Bobby Peru (a memorable Willem Dafoe).Filmmaker David Lynch has always done very well at telling interesting stories that bring out the most offbeat qualities in his characters. Here, he pours on the style and the sordid melodrama, alternating between excess and some subtlety as he lays out the romance at the core of the tale. Basing his script on a novel by Barry Gifford, he gives his typically eclectic cast some juicy dialogue to deliver.Now, granted, some of the actors & actresses barely have time to leave an impression, but there's a lot of talent here, so minimal screen time is not as much of an issue as it could have been. Lynch occasionally pours on the graphic violence (the demise of Peru is a highlight), but thanks to an entertaining story and these incredible actors, he keeps his grip throughout.Cage is amusing as he does his best to exude ""cool""; he and the sexy Dern do make a good couple. In addition to those supporting actors already mentioned, people like Crispin Glover (as the cousin with the Christmas fetish and the roaches in his underwear), Calvin Lockhart, Isabella Rossellini, Grace Zabriskie (one of this viewers' favourite character actresses, cast as a crazed, crippled hit woman), Sherilyn Fenn, Marvin Kaplan, William Morgan Sheppard, David Patrick Kelly, Freddie Jones, John Lurie, Jack Nance, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Frances Bay, Frank Collison, and Sheryl Lee all turn up as well. KoKo Taylor makes a musical appearance. Several years later, the Rossellini character, Perdita Durango, got a movie of her own, where she was played by Rosie Perez.All in all, this is certifiably odd in the Lynch tradition, complete with ""Wizard of Oz"" references, but it does hold ones' attention, ultimately ending the yarn with some degree of satisfaction.Seven out of 10.",Wild at Heart
13,LeonLouisRicci,Touching and Troubling,6,17 May 2012,"Sailor and Lula travel from Graceland to Oz by way of Hell. The film goes over the top, over the rainbow and by the time it's over, we are more disgusted than entertained. David Lynch is a surreal, schizophrenic, sentimentalist and those damn decadent demons won't let him be. There are strong dead-on performances from Nick Cage and Laura Dern and the assorted Picassoesque players and as usual, some demented style.Wild at heart is both touching and troubling, but weird on top to the extreme and crosses that bridge too far...but still drowns in its own excesses.",Wild at Heart
14,christopher-underwood,award for the most scary person of all goes to,8,3 March 2017,"Its not perfect and its barely one of Lynch's best but it is still a very good movie and a joy, if a rather scary one, to watch. Laura Dern, apparently foregoing her non nudity clause, puts in a very brave performance, possibly her best. Nicolas Cage, famously variable is spot on in this all the way through. There may be doubts during the narrative as to whether this is intended to be a love story or a hate story but Cage persuades from start to finish with an massive performance. Convincing as the tough, ruthless, almost psychotic, gentle romantic guy. Probably the second most scary person in this is Laura Derry's mother Diane Ladd playing her mother, which is pretty scary in itself but this gets worse and worse. And the award for the most scary person of all goes to - Willem Defoe, but then isn't he always and he finds new ways to be so. Some great scenes, maybe a little overlong, but then Lynch does so love those endless highways.",Wild at Heart

Lula was a very unusual role to play, who loved her man more than anything else in this entire world and it was great to see that Sailor finally found his place in her life along with his cute son.

So both hit the road to find happiness only they find a wicked and cruel underworld awaits them on their road of journey.This film proves life is no fairy tale as it's a dark and wild wicked madness journey for many this movie is also supported well by Willem Dafoe, Harry Dean Stanton, Isabella Rossellini and many others overall it's a pretty good cult classic film to watch.",Wild at Heart
18,Red-Barracuda,A road movie that is quintessential Lynch,9,9 May 2013,"Wild at Heart was probably the film that David Lynch directed at the height of his fame. It was released off the back of the major television event that was Twin Peaks. As it happened it was screened to great acclaim in Cannes resulting in it winning the Palme d'Or. It is essentially a surreal road movie, a sub-genre of film that is well suited to Lynch's eccentricities seeing as it is a format that is geared towards a plot-line that is a succession of strange events. In it a young couple – an Elvis fixated ex-con called Sailor and his lover Lula - hit the road to escape the latter's psychotic mother who sends some shady underworld figures after them. The plot synopsis doesn't really tell you much though because the joy of the movie is in the details. The story is really only a means for Lynch to string a series of strange events together. Nevertheless, Wild at Heart does make definite sense as a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. But apart from that, it's a bizarre ride.Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern are the young lovers in which this strange tale revolves around. They meet many strange characters along the way. This includes quite a number of bizarre cameos from the likes of Crispin Glover as a Christmas obsessive, Freddie Jones as a helium voiced bar-fly and Jack Nance as a trailer-park weirdo who talks about a dog. It's the characters with a little more depth to them that make a real mark though, like Willem Dafoe as the unforgettably creepy Bobby Peru and Diane Ladd who plays Lula's deranged mother who at one point disturbingly covers her face with lipstick and is depicted as a wicked witch throughout. Moreover, Wild at Heart is partially a homage to The Wizard of Oz in many other ways – we even have Sheryl Lee (Laura Palmer from Twin Peaks) appearing at the end as the Good Witch.The approach of the film is consistently very stylised. It's fabulous visually with striking imagery and great use of colour. In this way Lynch ensures that the dream-like ambiance is beautifully maintained. Or maybe that should be nightmare ambiance, seeing as this is probably the most violent film in the director's filmography. Its mixture of dark themes with highly charged eroticism is pretty typical though and is a combination he has used frequently. Another common trait here is in his use of music. Characters once again break the action to croon pop songs from the 50's/60's; this was also the first time where he incorporated intense heavy metal tunes as well. It's a strange combination in a strange film.I guess you could place Wild at Heart as a film somewhere between Lynch's full on surrealist movies like Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me and his more straightforward narratives like Blue Velvet. Its tone is wildly uneven as a consequence. The parts seem greater than the whole in fairness but what parts!",Wild at Heart
19,KineticSeoul,Weird and yet engrossing love story,7,30 April 2011,"Now I had no idea what this movie was about, but decided to check it out since I heard this movie has Nicholas Cage when he was actually pretty good. He was good in this, but the set up and everything is sort of weird in some aspects. In fact just about every character in this movie is a bit awkward, but the style of this movie makes it really stand out. The plot is sort of random and it's a bit of a random road movie in some aspects. And has snakeskin jacket wearing Nicholas Cage who isn't a necessarily a villain in this movie, but still a bit of a crazy character. And is facing the obstacle of loving someone and going through some tough times while on the road. And he manages to pull it off pretty well, he makes the character entertaining to watch. Sailor(Nicholas Cage) also has a contract out on him for a reason and it all goes in a road movie with a bit of adult fairy tale in it. Overall this is a engrossing movie, weird but engrossing and kept my interest most of the way through. I am giving this a 7.2 because it was bleak and dull sometimes.7.2/10",Wild at Heart
20,thesar-2,"Sex, Smokes & Sailor",3,12 April 2018,"Warning: Breathing secondhand smoke is a known cause of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Children are also more likely to have lung problems, ear infections, and severe asthma from being around smoke. Secondhand smoke causes heart disease and lung cancer. ... Breathing secondhand smoke can make you sick.So, watch this movie at your own risk. Oh, and let the kids stay over at their friend's house.Yeah, that's what I took from this: extremely little plot, a tremendous amount of okay sex scenes and so much smoking, I couldn't help but cough up a lung despite no real smoke coming through my TV. Seriously, it was truly distracting. Was that the point? Because I couldn't find much of one otherwise.My guess it's about a somewhat violent man who was tamed by his gal, shunned by her mother, hunted by goons she hires and on a direct mission to Cali only to get lost along the way. Oh, and you might get the impression everyone's a smoker. Hey, I'm not the only one beating that dead horse.You'd think I was an antismoker. No, I understand addiction and being a responsible person doing what you want with your life. But, what I don't get is just how over-excessive it was here. Fine, establish they're smokers, show one-two scenes of them smoking, we'll get the picture. Does it need to take up one hour and 58 minutes of a two hour five minute movie? There's also a ton of sex, but not that much and it's clearly established they're horny for each other.I digress. Yes, this was from a young David Lynch. True, I am not a Lynch fan by ANY means, but this came recommended to me. It just felt like an audition movie. Since it was one of his first, it truly felt that way, or as the famous Stuart from MADtv would say: ""Look at what I can do!""Though it came recommended to me, I can't do the same. It's quirky for no reason towards the end, like they were losing their minds from all the secondhand smoke (okay, I promise no more of that.) It's not that unusually shot, the acting's passable and the story is blah. And Willem Defoe's teeth were so hideous, I had to look away from the screen whenever he was on. Of course, intentional, but it's hard to watch a movie when you're facing the other way. ***Final thoughts: Oh, and enough with the Elvis in Oz beaten down our throats. I get it. Sheesh! Lynch, do you want us just to call you brilliant for the references and ""hidden"" meanings? Sure, some might. I won't be one of those.",Wild at Heart
21,ElMaruecan82,"In the vicinity of vice, sin and insanity...",7,22 December 2017,"""Wild at Heart"" is a nonstop nonsensical orgy of sex and violence that can only rely on its stylish inventiveness to build an ersatz if interest.Don't you even dare expecting the luxury of a ""plot"", Lynch obviously didn't intend to tell a story of the conventional type, its love-on-the-run-going-wild-and-tainted-with- fantasy approach takes it to such unexpected levels of surrealism that you can't even be sure if the film was intended to please an audience, even a minority, or to please Lynch himself... or the actors for that matter.Speaking of the whole sex, drug and Rock and Roll trinity, I don't mind a good adrenaline-shot every once in a while but not a perfusion! It's very telling when even the quieter moments maintain enough level of weirdness you start wondering what the bloody hell is going on? This is a Lynch movie of course, not an Ivory-Merchant production but even in his previous movies, the hearts of weird darkness we were plunged in were neighboring more ordinary realms, thus creating interesting contrasts and highlighting the ubiquity of evil in a 'good' world or good in the evil one.""The Elephant Man"" depicted a beast of a man who through his emotional journey and encounters with men of different backgrounds and levels of empathy, revealed himself to be the most human of all, and making a 'monster' out of the very society that ostracized him. ""Blue Velvet"" was all about a juxtaposition of a postcard-like normality and a young ""clean"" man strangely drawn to a world of sex and violence. The film is a sort of foretaste to the more impetuous ""Wild at Heart"" but there was a poetry, a romanticism and an edgy attitude that mostly came from the bad guys. In the case of ""Wild at Heart"", that sense of irony, this total rejection of all the predicaments of good taste and behavior belong to the ""good"" as well as the bad guys.Nicolas Cage plays an exuberant Elvis-like free-spirited figure as Sailor, and Laura Dern is both sexy and vulnerable as Lula, her lover, Diane Ladd is the mother who rejects this union and makes it a personal matter to prevent that love from happening. Each of these characters is irredeemable in a way or another, Sailor is wrapped up in an envelope self-confidence that challenges our strong desire to root for him. When your main protagonist beats a black man to pulp and then savors his victory by taking a cowboy-like pose and lighting a cigarette, this is pushing the ""antiheroic"" notion to 11.Lula's obsession with Sailor can be regarded as self-abandonment satisfying a feeling of total completion but even in that sweet moment where she was revealing to Sailor what she loved in him... and ""in her"" for that matter, there was something fake in Sailor's reaction, not in Cage's acting, but the character of Sailor, you could tell his ego was flattered, he had that 'cigarette' pose again and it seemed like the film built a sort of huge pedestal over which he could dance a crazy jig, while Lula was just a trophy girl, his girl, maybe slightly more valuable than the snake jacket that highlighted his sense of individuality. Well, how about Lula's individuality? How about exploring the waves of dementia in the name of love going through all her body?Lynch even leaves an interesting subplot unexplored by not examining deeper the relationship between Lula and her mother, played by Diane Ladd. Did she hate her mother because she hated Sailor, or loved Sailor even more because her mother was against their union? Instead of developing these two characters, especially played by a mother and her daughter in real life, Lynch can only make them exist through the perspective of men, and the mother has the sleaziest ones. She hires professional gangsters to kill Sailor (Harry Dean Standon, Willem Dafoe) only to make things escalate for the worst, leading to chaos and displays of violence so over the top you can't take them seriously, not that I believe this was the intent.""Wild at Heart"" has at least one quality, its titles is perfect, the French one: ""Sailor and Lula"" has a cool musicality, but the film is indeed wild at heart. And like anything wild, it can only build its appeal on chaos, it's all about the stylizing of chaos in love and sex with gory and garish special effects and a turbulent editing that contributes to make the film quite an experience... but for whom? As a viewer, I ""experienced"" the film but I didn't care much, maybe I'm too conservative but I wish there was a 'context' to allow me to appreciate these moments of insanity. Many similar movies had a point, a reason, ""Bonnie and Clyde"", ""Badlands"" and ""Natural Born Killers"" all have a more or less nihilistic approach to live, yet driven by passion as the only thing worth dying for... but ""Wild at Heart"" is busier making effects than a point.It's not a bad film, far from it, but it plays like a sort of bloody joke where you realize near the end that it's a private one and you're not part of it. You want to embrace it, to 'feel' it, but every time you try, the film pushes you back and yet asks you to enjoy it. There's something schizophrenic about it, on an intellectual level, it's cool, even fascinating, but it all comes down to one simple thing: is it an 'enjoyable' movie? I don't think so... and I wish I did.For all its weirdness and exuberance, I can't understand its controversial ""Wild at Heart"", but oddly enough, I also can.",Wild at Heart
22,bowmanblue,You have to be in the mood,7,25 April 2017,"I guess there's probably three types of people when it comes to David Lynch films (1) People who love his work and find it unique, deep and a refreshing change from the Hollywood norm (2) People who find it a pretentious mess, lacking in any real story (3) People who say, ""Who's David Lynch?"" If you fall into the third category then I guess that jumping into his 1990 film 'Wild at Heart' is as good as any place to start your journey into his twisted mind. For 'Wild at Heart' is quite a 'typical' David Lynch film, in that it's narrative deliberately strays away from being particularly 'linear' and – in many cases – is open to interpretation as to what is actually going on in the story. Much of what you get from a David Lynch film is based on how it makes you feel, rather than the story it tells.The film stars Nicholas Cage, who plays a young man with a – you guessed it – wild streak. He falls in love with a young – and kind of equally wild – seventeen year old (Lynch's favourite leading lady, Laura Dern) and the two of them embark on a road trip across the wastelands of America – much to the disgust of Dern's on screen mother! In fact, rather than just posting a snotty comment on her Facebook status, she goes and hires some weird hit men to 'take care of the situation' (if you know what I mean?). Thus the film takes on a more murderous tone.So, they travel across America meeting one weird person after the next, participating in weird dialogue and perforated by weird s*xual exploits (all of this totally normal for a David Lynch film!). Now, when I talk about Lynch's trademark 'weirdness' I normally refer to not just the dialogue that's spoken, but the WAY it's said. Pauses are drawn out longer than is normal, making conversation deliberately uncomfortable. Then you have the – seemingly random – bursts of dramatic music overlaid across simple actions like a car pulling slowly into a parking space. And that's just the tip of the 'weirdness iceberg' – everything is pretty 'textbook Lynch' and to add an extra bizarre feel to the proceedings, it's loosely based on 'The Wizard of Oz!' (you'll soon pick up the not so subtle symbolism!).Nicholas Cage is allowed to almost run free, which does play well into his 'wild' nature. Dern too goes a little mad sometimes, however I did find her a little annoying from time to time due to her constant screaming that would make 'Willie' from 'Temple of Doom' proud! The rest of the cast pop up here and there, act weird and then go away again – this really is Cage's baby. However, just because we never see Lynch on screen (you'll have to watch 'Twin Peaks' for that – and it's worth it) you can see his fingerprints all over it. His use of fire is nearly as prominent as in 'Twin Peaks.' I guess this is used to denote danger. That's a fairly obvious one, but there are those elements of the film that even a die-hard Lynch fan doesn't understand! So, where do I come down on the three types of people I spoke about in my opening paragraph? Well, as I said, I'm a die-hard fan. I do watch all his stuff and enjoy (most of) it. I like the mood and feel he creates, even if the story does get more than a little confusing. His work is a refreshing change from the 'classic Hollywood narrative' that we're so used to. But, don't get me wrong – his films are hard work! I don't always get what he's trying to say. In 'Wild at Heart' there is at least a main story running through it. This is more than can be said for one of his later films, 'Inland Empire.' That, despite a few moments of 'Lynchian gold' was almost unwatchable when it came to its 'story!' So, if you're a fan of David Lynch's (filmic) work then you should know what you're in for. If you've never seen one of his films before, have a long, hard think about what you've read here before you invest your time into it. And, if you simply hate his work, I doubt there's much here to win you round.Oh, and maybe I should have added a 'fourth' category when it comes to people and their relationship to Lynch's work – (4) People who have seen his cult TV show 'Twin Peaks' and are therefore intrigued as to how his work translates to the big screen. I'll tell you now that 'Wild at Heart' bears little resemblance to the show (besides a fair few of its actors making cameos), so if you're looking for some 'Damn fine cherry pie,' then you won't find it here.",Wild at Heart
23,dromasca,one of David Lynch's best,9,24 April 2009,"'Wild at Heart' is one of the best films of David Lynch, maybe second only to 'Blue Velvet'. The story is more simple and the style more direct than in some of his latest films, but this leaves place here for his full talent and expressiveness to get to the screen. The approach in describing the a violent world of crime with characters being more victims than villains despite their violent behavior reminds very much the films of Tarantino. In a few world Lynch at his best looking as Tarantino at his best.The film is a combination of crime story, love story and road film, all in a style of childish and naive innocence. The two principal characters are splendidly played by Nicholas Cage (in the first in a series of bad-but-redeemable-guy roles) and Laura Dern engaging in a deadly run trying to escape the revenge and will to set them apart of her mother, making love and seeding blood and death around them. They are not so much a Bonnie and Clyde couple, but rather two grown up kids trying to run under the sign of the wizard of Oz, but actually looking from refuge from unspeakable traumas of their childhood. The strong soundtrack, the acting style, the efficient story telling make this likable and expressive film survive well the two decades since it was made.",Wild at Heart

25,secondtake,Crazy at Heart,6,9 November 2010,"Wild at Heart (1990)An inventive, crazy, abusive, drugged up, violent, sexed up, romantic, anti-romantic, road trip pseudo noir campy intense up and down silly disturbing movie.But is it any good? Is it fun to watch, or moving, or beautiful? Maybe, if you are pre-disposed. At times I was amused or bemused or fascinating or surreal in a raw and theatrical way. It doesn't always add up, and even though it isn't meant to, the movie feels so self-indulgent you feel like the style is used to hide sloppy movie-making. It's a campy mess, really, with a whole slew of episodic turns and twists. You couldn't really care less about anyone or anything. It's too comic booky for that. Nick Cage is a bit too much to take, too...you might find him funny, or just overacting. There are some terrific performances--a hyped up, silly sexy Laura Dern, a hardened Isabella Rosselini, a characteristic Harry Dean Stanton, an unpredictable Willem Defoe, and so on, quite a quirky cast! A lot happens in two hours, and it has that wide open American landscape behind it. It's no doubt sexist, but I doubt any of its fans care a bit. And luckily, this kind of highly stylized film has its fans. Surely the glossy saturated nightmare and all the sex and violence is has all the earmarks of counterculture hedonism. That's good if you're into that. But I constantly think how much more powerful it could have been. There are moments, and scenes, that are fabulous, really brilliant. But in the long run it's a lazy movie, depending on its weirdness far too often. For me that's not enough. Curious, but not enough.",Wild at Heart
26,Bored_Dragon,Divided impressions,7,21 September 2017,"Story and its linearity are not quite typical for Lynch, but his directing is obvious from the first scene. At times I wanted to pause the movie just to go to IMDb and give it pure ten and then at times I was at the edge to give up on this crap. That kind of conflicted reactions only Lynch can cause. Movie reminds me quite a lot of Natural Born Killers, or should I reverse it considering this one is older. And Laura Dern reminds me of Juliette Lewis too, mostly by acting, but facially in some cadres too. I think Dern and Cage are ugliest movie couple i ever saw and still they have such magical charisma together. Angelo Badalamenti did excellent job with music once again and Cage is surprisingly good in his numbers. Movie is over two hours long and, although it has lots of legendary scenes I will never forget, it has some completely redundant and even cheesy scenes in typically Lynch manner. If he could just cut off those few scenes to bring movie down to more compact shape and size it would be, if not ten, at least strong nine. But in shape it is now I can not give it more than7,5/10I was blown away by scene when Willem Dafoe comes over Laura Dern i motel room. Although this movie is full of awesome scenes, this one left the strongest impression on me.Fun fact - Diane Ladd i Laura Dern, who play roles of mother and daughter, are in fact mother an d daughter in real life. :D",Wild at Heart
27,Rodrigo_Amaro,"Different, Mesmerizing, Funny",9,16 February 2011,"Violent, vivid and strangely humorous, David Lynch's ""Wild at Heart"" has many memorable moments, and it might be a source of inspiration for Tarantino's early works, and it's a great film with very few things to say.Before Mickey and Mallory appear there was Sailor and Lula (played by Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern), a young couple in love challenging everybody who's on their way trying to stop them for being together, most notably Lula's possessed and scary mom (Diane Ladd) who thinks that Sailor is a criminal (she provoked this instinct on him when some killer tried to kill him, but instead was murdered). This crazy woman contracted a detective (Harry Dean Stanton) to follow the couple, and also another man (J.E.Freeman) that works almost like a hit-man who is trying to get the detective out of the way of his business. These and other characters are bound together not only in the story but in a quirky rereading of ""The Wizard of Oz"" film mentioned all the way by countless references, jokes, and visions of the Bad Witch (Lula's mom) and the Good Witch (played by Sheryl Lee). Instead of Dorothy's wish to find the Magician, return to her home and help her new friends, here in ""Wild at Heart"" we have the main couple who seeks for peace, love and understanding but there's no magician who can do that.One thing people need to understand about this film is that performances here are meant to be bad and that's why the film succeeds. All that exaggerated acting coming from B-films of the 1940's and 1950's are meant to be presented this way here to make a funnier film that has a unusual violence that might cause shock or might cause some laughs (but it's impossible to laugh at the murder of Sailor's first victim with the head skull appearing in a pool of blood). Lynch's idea worked better with Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Natural Born Killers"" (yes, he wrote the film but didn't directed but the similarities between films are enormous, but ""NBK"" is more controversial, shocking and funnier after a couple of views). If Cage with Elvis impersonations and Dern with her dreamy voice sounds like cheap performances think again and watch the movie with a different perspective, you'll find all that very interesting, quite funny. But the most impressive performances here are delivered by Diane Ladd (Oscar nominated for her role) and Willem Dafoe playing a psychotic bank robber; his two best scenes are the one where she talks to Laura Dern in the motel room, and his departure from the story, one of the strangest things you're gonna see in films.The only thing that bothers me about this film is that it looks like Lynch haven't got nothing to say with this story. It is a impressive and stunning film, visually mesmerizing but it doesn't says nothing more than his complex and twisted works such as ""Blue Velvet"", ""Mulholland Dr."" and ""Inland Empire"". You watch these characters wandering around here and there, some accidents happening and lots of music in the background so....? and your point is...? For someone known as an adept of Meditation who constantly keeps us thinking on his works after it finishes and we never know what just happened (""Eraserhead"" does that perfectly) this film seemed to simple for him and for its audience, except for the dark humor, and some innovations in story telling which makes of this film something memorable and outstanding, very different than some low quality, errant and devious things that sometimes we watch and call of ""films"".Don't give up while watching, you're gonna be surprised by the vast original elements displayed here, lots of fun. 9/10",Wild at Heart
28,merklekranz,A love story that goes nowhere ...........,6,21 November 2009,"When you think about it, ""Wild at Heart"" is really a movie that goes nowhere, except to put two lovers on a road trip so a nice assortment of weird characters can be introduced along the way. The film is above average, not dull, but feels stretched at two hours plus. A partly surreal, violent, sexy, nightmare would be a good place to begin describing this film. Most definitely the cream of the bizarre is William Dafoe's ""Bobby Peru"", but really no one appears normal, except for perhaps the police officer who stumbles upon Bobby Peru's sure thing robbery. This is definitely an acquired taste, so if you are prepared for the weirdness, you might find ""Wild at Heart"" intriguing. - MERK",Wild at Heart
29,Dr_Coulardeau,Mother and father versus daughter or son,10,21 August 2007,"A simple film by David Lynch. Of course you have suspense. Of course you have a good thriller. Of course too you have a good love story and gangster story intertwined. But there is something more than that in this simple film. David Lynch, for an unreasonable, i.e. unexplainable, reason decides to have a good sentimental positive ending. That enables us to draw a lesson from the rest of the film and transform a simple gangster story into a philosophical story about family and parents. A possessive mother can destroy everything around her but there is no reason for the daughter to yield and the daughter will always win against her possessive mother. Even evil witchcraft, or mafia gangsters, will not save the mother's stake. On the other side the father is an indispensable presence in the life of a child, be he a boy or she a girl. The possessive mother will get rid of the father if necessary just like she will get rid of her own lover if he stands in the way of her possessive schizophrenia (to commit suicide with lipstick, ah ah ah). But the father will survive for the daughter as a target to attain and recreate in the man she will choose to love, be impregnated by and ""marry"" in a way or another. But what's more the child born from this union will need a father and will recognize him at first sight even six years after his birth or so. Is this line, this thread going along all David Lynch's films? Maybe not so clearly but yes there is a family problem in all films, a link with some kind of a family, a father, a mother, an aunt, or someone else. The happy ending of this film and the way it is constructed at the very last minute in a very spectacular flight and return scene and then exploited through all the credits seem to show this family link is the essential link in the back of David Lunch's (at least ) subconscious mind. Well done and rather entertaining. And I loved the Deep Creek, Gulch, Stream, Bay or whatever, but Deep anyway, in the middle of a desertic nowhere somewhere in Texas, if it is Texas. As for the setting of some deep tragedy in the deepest layers of the minds of the characters or the dregs of society it is perfect with a heroin called Fortune and a hero called Sailor, that is wet with humor and damp with wit.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine & University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",Wild at Heart

31,leplatypus,Love in a toilet bowl (vhs),7,18 December 2015,"I can understand why Lynch likes the story because it's indeed how he feels the world : unlike Burton, Spielberg who sticks to « beauty », Lynch really likes the decay, the filth, the under belly, the vomit, the perversions, the paranoids, the violence For him, there's something artistic in those leftover and as this love story is built on them, he was surely very happy ! So, in a way, this is a rather unique and powerful romance because we are not used to see lovers like this ! Beyond the content, the visual is also masterful : for one time, we have a director who cuts flashbacks with intelligence, who uses zooms and large frame with talent and who really understands colors ! Soundtrack is cool with very different sources mixed well together : from classical, to Badalamenti, to Presley, to metalAt last, the casting is really well-built : Dafoe is really scary, Cage finds one of his best character, Rosselini achieves in 5 minutes what she lacked in one hour in « blue velvet » and the family duo of Ladd is unusual in film history : to have a mother and daughter playing the same parts in such a deranged movie is a real experience So, it's true that along 2 hours, we have our eyes, our ears, ours brains exploded with talent so Palme d'Or was deserved.

35,funkyfry,One of Lynch's most enjoyable films,8,18 December 2006,"Wild at Heart, like most of David Lynch's other films, takes us into a kind of exotic and surreal parallel universe. The ride this time is more enjoyable and somewhat less confusing (and possibly less profound) than usual, thanks largely to great chemistry between Nick Cage (Sailor) and Laura Dern (Lula) and an exceptional supporting cast of bizarre characters.The film is very cinematic in the classic sense of the word -- it combines all the elements of sound and sight to create the illusion of interior reality. The music is a combination of Badalamente's usual mellow jazz tones with significant classical works and some Elvis and other rockabilly thrown in, even with some heavy metal.I'd love to say some really illuminating things about the movie, but it really has to speak for itself. Like I said, I think the supporting cast is great. Casting Diane Ladd in the mother role was inspired, and she gives a truly horrific performance. I really enjoy Harry Dean Stanton in this one and Willem Dafoe does some of his very best work in the unforgettable role of ""Bobby Peru"", a small time hit man with bad teeth and a nasty sense of humor. Crispen Glover and Isabella Rossellini also appear in brief bits, and we even get a good cameo from long-time Lynch regular Jack Nance.One minor criticism -- I think Lynch's interest in dopplegangers (which was effectively used in ""Lost Highway"") kind of backfired here. Rossellini and Zabriskie's characters are so similar in appearance that the first few times I saw the movie I didn't realize they were different characters.I think at some points you could easily criticize the film for showing things that are un-necessary in terms of story and might feel like overkill -- for example the car crash Lula and Sailor come across or the Glover character who is obsessed with Christmas and cockroaches. But it's all intentional and I think works well in the film in terms of feeling and mood. The sense is that these are two good-hearted kids who as one says ""got lost along the yellow brick road"". It's Sailor and Lula's relative innocence and the intensity of their love that gives this film a lot of heart. The escalating series of events often seems unrealistic, sometimes totally absurd or surreal (as when he sings Elvis songs or when they are visited by Glinda), but it goes to emphasize that they are getting deeper and deeper into this bizarre world that lies outside their own cocoon. The parallels to Elvis and to the Wizard of Oz are interesting because, while not totally intellectualized, I think they represent the dream world of the characters.",Wild at Heart
36,Captain_Couth,The World of David Lynch: Wild at Heart.,8,15 August 2005,"Wild at Heart (1990) was David Lynch's revision of the Wizard of Oz. A tale about to lovers (Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern) who were never meant to fall for each other. Their road to happiness lies past a gauntlet of odd fellows and psychopaths who want to ruin their happy future. Not even the threat of death or incarceration will split these two love birds. Another surrealistic drama from the master of the oddity and madness David Lynch. Brilliant cinematography and solid acting from the entire cast makes this one a watchable winner.This movie has to be seen to be believed. A cast filled with a wide selection of actors (Wilhem Dafoe, Diane Ladd, Isabella Rossellini, and Crispin Glover) who all mesh in nicely under the effective direction of David Lynch. WILD AT HEART was made during his Twin Peaks phase of his career. He was juggling the t.v. series and a couple of films during this period. Like his other films, WILD AT HEART was ignored at the box office. Pretty soon his T.V. show suffered the same fate.Highly recommended.",Wild at Heart
37,mjneu59,abnormal behavior,5,15 January 2011,"David Lynch once admitted to making movies about things that frighten him, and after seeing this comedy-noir freak show it's obvious he must be terrified of criticism from the political Far Right. The film is a catalogue of nightmares guaranteed to offend any card-carrying conservative: heavy metal music, raw language, kinky sex and violence, a casual abortion, so on and so forth.The token storyline, adapted (rather freely) from a novel by Barry Gifford, follows two rebellious young lovers on the lam from an assortment of warped sideshow villains and the usual pathological refugees from Lynch's overwrought imagination. With its almost epic displays of bloodshed and sex the film certainly lives up to its title, but there's a disturbing sense of familiarity about it. By now the peculiar habits and dark obsessions of its director are too well known, and this postmodern nightmare only redefines the same evil undercurrents of his earlier 'Blue Velvet' on a bigger budget and even more outrageous scale.At its best (in some of the more offbeat digressions) the details are morbidly amusing in a way that recalls Fellini or Buñuel, and the director's hallmark visionary style and outer-limit dream logic are still compelling. But a colorful rut is still a rut, and controversy for its own sake is always an artistic dead-end. In the end the film is just another excuse for Lynch to test how far he can push the censors, with results ranging from brilliantly perverse to just plain embarrassing, and not even the occasional arcane reference to The Wizard of Oz will endear the film to anyone but the most die-hard of the director's fans.",Wild at Heart
38,NateWatchesCoolMovies,"Fiery, beautifully brutal addition to Lynch's career",10,2 August 2015,"In my cinematic pantheon, there are three great 1990's homages to the violence, romance and lovers on the run shtick of Bonnie And Clyde: Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers, Tony Scott's True Romance... and David Lynch's Wild At Heart. It's definitely the weird one of the bunch, let me tell you that. But it's also a kaleidoscope of fiery passion, deranged characters, bloody violence and a running theme of Wizard Of Oz references that allow the crazy color scheme to pop off the screen like fireworks. It's one of the most beautiful looking films of the 90's. Subject matter wise, it's also one of the ugliest. There's a whole lot of lurid, surreal, extremely taboo sexual and violent content here, so only go for it if you're in a full moon kinda mood. Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern are dynamite as Sailor Ripley and Lula Pace Fortune, two Louisiana kids deeply in love, who high tail it on the run from Lula's demented, unstable monster of a mother (Diane Ladd, Dern's real life mother, got an Oscar nod). She hires all sorts of creeps to follow them, from ruthless mobster Marcellos Santos (J.E. Freeman positively oozes sleaze), to the sadistic Juana Durango (Grace Zabriskie will give you nightmares). Also on their tail is PI Johnny Farugute, played with kooky stray dog aplomb by Harry Dean Stanton. Our lovers take a blood splattered yellow brick road past New Orleans out to Texas where they meet the weirdest character in the film, Bobby Peru. Willem Dafoe is a deranged wonder in the role, a volatile, sexually abusive demon of a man, and chews every scene as only Dafoe can. There's a whole sideshow of ridiculous characters, from Laura Palmer herself, Sheryl Lee, Jack Nance, Crispin Glover, John Lurie, Isabella Rossellini, David Patrick Kelly, and a gut wrenching cameo from Sherilyn Fenn that will leave you shaken to your core. My one problem with this flick is at times the grotesque nature is overbearing, and it seems Lynch just tosses stuff in for the love of fricken whatever. But it's a small quibble in an amazing film. He directs with a rainbow costumed aesthetic, almost poetry like dialogue, and a larger than life realm of monsters, jazz tunes, heavy metal, fire, murder, sex, love, Elvis, dancing, good and bad witches, and a constant thrumming vibe of feverishly surreal weirdness that will leave you panting, hot under the collar and stirred in that special way only cinema can induce. In Lynch's world, everything is Wild At Heart and weird on top.",Wild at Heart
39,kluseba,A modern Romeo and Juliet with lots of sex and violence,7,20 February 2011,"This is movie is somewhat a modern version of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet or a mixture of movies such as ""Bonnie & Clyde"", ""The wizard of Oz"" and David Lynch's previous ""Blue velvet"". It is a road movie about unconditional love and how a relationship can mature and become more than a running free romance. As for all of David Lynch's movies, there are many weird, retarded and brutal characters in this flick, a lot of violence and especially a lot of sex. Some mysterious and surreal scenes are also in this movie though not as many as in the later works of David Lynch. The movie is one of the rare ones of David Lynch that has no slow development as it begins with a quite heavy and rude scene and it is quite easy to follow and understand as the weird elements are often just details and little sidekick gems that have nothing to do with the main story. This movie may in that way please to the usual fans of the works of David lynch but also and especially to a larger public. The movie is surely entertaining, well acted and well filmed and that's why this flick gained a larger attention and success.If you liked ""Blue velvet"", you might like this movie without a doubt. Once again, there are many well known actors in this movie that have often worked with David Lynch. Laura Dern plays Lula, a young woman that escapes from her controlling and conservative mother and her past as a raped and abused child confronted with the mysterious death of her father. Jack Nance plays a strange vagabond that tells a strange tale of his dog. Sherilyn Fenn plays a car accident victim that acts like a porcelain doll. Along side those actors, you get some new ones that are also doing convincing job. Nicolas Cage plays a romantic and naive rebel looking for his attachment to unconditional freedom. Willem Dafoe plays a strange and ugly villain. Once again, almost every character has something special and unique to offer even if some of them seem to be slightly over the top or even ridiculous but that's a well known brand of Lynch's movies.The reason why this movie doesn't get a higher rating from me is that it doesn't have the unconditional way to freedom that main actor Nicolas Cage is always talking about. David Lynch seems to have been somewhat tamed to fit to a Hollywood movie and doesn't create a truly unique movie. Even the ""Dune"" movie about which Lynch wasn't happy at all in the end was more surreal and atmospheric than this one. I am missing the last kick of courage and genius to which I have been used by watching Lynch's entire movie collection. This movie is a less original one by him even though it is still a very good movie and not completely ordinary and tamed. I also think that some characters that are well introduced and seem promising aren't lead any further, like the menacing ""Santos"" that doesn't seem that frightening and evil in the end (he isn't comparable at all with the last villain of a Lynch movie before, Dennis Hopper in ""Blue velvet""), the strange and uneasy ""00 Spool"" (played by Jack Nance that doesn't get the chance to play as excellent as in ""Twin Peaks"" or even ""Eraserhead"") or the crazy cousin ""Dell"" (that doesn't have the charm of the crazy characters from ""Twin Peaks"" for example). This movie seems to be a quick shot and Lynch didn't put that much time and passion into the characters as he usually did.Finally, this is surely one of David Lynch's less convincing flicks but for any one that is looking for an entertaining and well played road movie with some surreal elements and a lot of sex, violence and rock'n'roll (the speed/thrash metal band ""Powermad"" is featured in this flick as well as songs by Elvis Presley), you will surely get an explosive mixture.",Wild at Heart

42,TOMNEL,"A weird and bizarre movie, but one of Lynch's easiest to understand.",8,15 March 2009,"What we have here beneath it's bizarre exterior is a fairly normal love story/on the run type of movie. The plot itself isn't too strange, and despite some unexplained incidents, anybody could understand the vast majority of this movie. Despite how easy to understand this generally is, this is still a Lynch movie, and it feels like 100% Lynch straight through. The characters are original and eclectic, and some are absolutely horrible, while some are quite likable, and several are just raging lunatics. That's what this movie is. It's a love story and a road movie, with a raging lunacy that no other movie, not even Lynch's own ""Blue Velvet"" has.Sailor (Nicholas Cage) brutally murders a man in self defense and is put in prison for almost two years. When he gets out, his old girlfriend Lula (Laura Dern) is there to pick him up. Lula can't return home because her mother, Marietta (Diane Ladd), a mentally unstable woman, will try to kill Sailor. Marietta sends a lover and private detective, Johnny Farragut (Harry Dean Stanton) to find Lula's whereabouts, and as a just in case, she sends a hardcore murderer, Stantos (J.E. Freeman) on Sailor's case. To add to the mix, Sailor ends up meeting Bobby Peru (Willem Dafoe), and from there, in summation, chaos ensues.The characters bring out the emotions they are supposed to. Nicholas Cage is a confused young man, but he is likable, and the audience cares what happens to him. Laura Dern is an edge of reason to the movie, and she is also very likable. Diane Ladd...well, her role needs to be seen, not described...she's a pathetic woman. Even Harry Dean Stanton, who is supposed to be a murderer is very likable. The only actor who eventually chewed up the scenery too much, was Willem Dafoe, who is almost interchangeable with Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper) from Lynch's Blue Velvet. Dafoe made the film hard to tolerate, and his character made the second act of the film less enjoyable than the first.Like most of Lynch's work, this one really needs a close analysis to get everything. Little scenes stick out, and there are probably hidden meanings behind them, but on the surface all they are, are Lynch being zany. And many of these zany scenes are thrown in the movie, and these scenes are what makes this movie so loony. A random story featuring Crispin Glover is thrown in, and a scene featuring Grace Zabriskie are extremely strange. And Diane Ladd, who is just brilliant in her own crazy way.This movie has a straightforward plot, and seems like it could be enjoyed by a wider audience than most of Lynch's works. Still, this is a strange movie, in a similar vein to Blue Velvet, but different in it's own way. If you like David Lynch, you'll be sure to love this.My rating: *** out of ****. 122 mins.

43,truemythmedia,A Lynchian Love Story,7,27 February 2020,"I feel like ""Wild at Heart"" is one of Lynch's forgotten films, and I can sort of see why. Though I enjoyed my time with Sailor (Nicolas Cage, ""Leaving Las Vegas""), Lula (Laura Dern, ""Marriage Story""), and all the other various other bizarre characters that populate this weird romantic tale, I can honestly say that this is one of my least favorite Lynch movies. It's not bad, it just doesn't do a whole lot for me, especially when compared to Lynch's masterpieces (Twin Peaks TV show, ""Eraserhead"", ""Mulholland Drive"", ""Inland Empire""). When Lynch is at the peak of his directing powers, his films can prompt me to question and meditate upon the very nature of our reality; ""Wild at Heart"" is just a decent road trip movie with a few really quirky moments and a whole lot of wackos.As a side note: it blows my mind that this won the Palme d'Or in 1990. According to IMDb's trivia section on this film, Roger Ebert, who seemed to have a distaste for Lynch (check out his ""Blue Velvet"" review), booed so loudly that it almost drowned out the cheers when the award was announced. Though I honestly don't think this film deserves to stand beside the likes of other winners like ""Parasite"", ""Shoplifters"", ""Blue is the Warmest Color"", or ""4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days"", I also can't ever imagine being so upset over a film award that I'd boo the recipient... but hey, that's just me.",Wild at Heart

Wild at heart definetly ranks up there as one of the oddest movies I've ever seen, yet despite certain moments of almost unwatchableness, the movie had that surreal feeling I love and great acting. This was the best role I've ever seen Laura Dern in and look for a small cameo from Cherlynn Fenn(2 moon junction). The movie's atmosphere actually was similiar to Junction.Still, as I'm not a fan of violent movies in general I do remember a bit much of that and I also remember just not being comfortable with certain scenes. I guess this is a movie that kind of holds you to your seat and presents itself so strongly that it really doesn't matter whether you like it alot, you'r just compelled to watch.I may have to watch this one again, I'm not sure how the movie would appear to me now and if I'd still feel that way after so many years but if I had to describe ""Wild at heart"" I'd have to say you may not love the movie but you can't stop watching if you start.

45,PredragReviews,"""What The Hell Was That All About?""",7,6 May 2016,"Wild at Heart is less a movie and more a psychological journey. It's hard for me to judge it the way I judge other movies; it simply can't be put under the same standards. Most movies are about entertainment and telling a story; this movie (like Blue Velvet before it) is about intense emotions, the darker side of the soul, and the warped mind of director David Lynch. David Lynch is one of the few directors left who still expresses himself through his work; he is one of the last true film artists. He indulges himself here, perhaps to an extreme. I'm not even sure I can say that this movie ""entertained"" me in the usual sense; but I relished the experience.Personally, I think they do a great job-it is meant to be humorous, and it works as a perfectly good counterpoint to the increasingly sinister obstacles they must overcome. Here is where the movie really shines: Lynch lets his imagination run wild in his depiction of a bizarre and dangerous underworld of criminal activity. Willem Dafoe is pitch-perfect as the sleazy hit-man, and the scene where he tries to seduce Laura Dern in the hotel room is one of the most disturbing moments of sexual tension ever caught on film. As with most David Lynch films, there are so many small details, so much humor and intelligence (as opposed to your average Hollywood hit) that it can be enjoyed over and over again. All in all, I think ""Wild at Heart"" is an underrated movie that, while far from Lynch's best, is very enjoyable. It is well-filmed and -directed, and there is a feeling of strength and energy that makes the film even more appealing.Overall rating: 7 out of 10.",Wild at Heart

47,DeeNine-2,"It's the brain damage, dude",7,9 November 1999,"A romantic comedy for people who would never admit they like romantic comedy: a romance for the grunge set replete with lots of flowing blood, guns going off, cigarettes apuffing, and slimy bit characters met on the lam. David Lynch directs with snap and shock and a devious sense of humor, but I think he ought to have the courage to make a romantic comedy straight out. He splashes guts and rubs our face in vomit to disguise the simple love story so his leather and chains audience can imagine they're seeing life in the raw instead of being seduced as their parents so often were by yet another Hollywood romance.Nicholas Cage plays Barry Gifford's Sailor like a dumbed-down Elvis Presley (and that was before he grabbed the microphone), and Laura Dern as Lulu captures well the mentality of a sweet, shallow, but meat-eating little thing who just wants to have fun. When I first saw her in Smooth Talk (1985) (from a story by Joyce Carol Oates) I thought she was just flat out sexy, but here she seems a little dull even if she does have ""breasts that stand up and say hello."" Diane Ladd, as Lulu's mother, employing some Phyllis Diller shtick, is funny as the wicked witch of the east on testosterone.What saves this movie from the ridiculous is the fact that the poor saps, Sailor and Lulu, really love each other. He makes her ""hotter than Georgia asphalt,"" and he finds her ""dangerously cute."" They have a whole bunch of mindless love-but maybe that's the best kind.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

The (love & hate) story is basically straightforward (with a few too many flashbacks when things are pretty obvious anyway), but the hardships which Sailor and Lula have to endure, add the extra layer. The best example - and also one of the best scenes of the film - is when Lula encounters Bobby Peru in the motel room; though Willem Dafoe also shows us that he is a better actor than Nicolas Cage (even if Cage is better for the part of Sailor).'Wild...' has many bonus characters that do not add much to the story, but they do add to (the atmosphere of) the film, as do some haphazard scenes, like the one when they encounter a survivor at a car accident.

50,BrandtSponseller,"Beautiful, violent, funny and surreal--a masterpiece from David Lynch",10,22 July 2005,"This is one of my favorite David Lynch films. It is also one of the more transparent, easy to understand Lynch films, although that's not the reason why it's one of my favorites. But that fact also makes Wild at Heart a good candidate for introducing someone to Lynch.On the other hand, although it's more transparent and linear on a surface level, I'm still not sure I've figured out the multilayered, bizarre subtexts and symbolism that lie deep beneath the surface--even though I've seen it a few times now. Assuming that there is indeed something to figure out. To an extent, it seems like maybe the hint of something ""deeper"" is in this case more of a red herring. This is one of Lynch's funnier films, albeit very macabre humor. It contains references to all of Lynch's most common ""content quirks""including sequined ingénues singing jazz, manipulative housewife types, shots of asphalt speeding by, minor characters with freaky speech ""impediments"", severed body parts, and on and on--but it's almost as if he's making fun of himself. Combine that with excellent performances (including a hilarious bit part for Crispin Glover, one of my favorite actors/personalities), a sublimely incongruous score, and a retro, gripping, violent road trip saga cum romance that presages both Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers (1994) and just about all of Quentin Tarantino's career, and you've got quite a film.Wild at Heart, based on a novel by Barry Gifford, is the tale of Sailor (Nicolas Cage) and Lula (Laura Dern), a doe-eyed, ""classy white trash"" couple. As the film starts--and what a start it is--someone tries to stab Sailor to death as he's exiting a theater. Sailor will have none of it, and Lynch begins the film on an exhilarating, brutally violent note--this is not a film for the faint of heart. To complicate matters and set up the primary conflict, we learn even before the attempted stabbing that the hit man was sent by Lula's mother, Marietta Fortune (Diane Ladd), who claimed that Sailor tried to seduce her in the bathroom (this isn't quite true, as we learn in detail later).There isn't a character in the film who isn't involved with some shady business, either presently or in the past. Sailor and Marietta's tensions stem from many years ago, when Lula was just a girl (she's supposedly quite a bit younger than Sailor). The events of the film's opening result in Sailor being imprisoned. Lula dutifully waits for his release, much to the consternation of her mom. The basic gist of the film is disarmingly simple--Sailor and Lula are headed across the country, with an eventual goal of California, as Marietta tries to arrange for Sailor to be put away for good. There are many finely realized subplots and detailed tangents, but that's the crux of the plot on the surface.In addition to his typical hyperreal/surreal weirdness, Lynch concocts a very improbable stew of influences that work together beautifully. Lula has something of an obsession with The Wizard of Oz (1939). She's haunted by visions of the wicked witch (including the ""evil cackle""), and she sees the road trip as a veritable journey to the Emerald City. Lynch works in a lot of subtle references to The Wizard of Oz with other characters, too. Sailor is something like lounge version of Elvis reincarnated as a gangster flunky, with even better karate moves to match. Yet the two are huge heavy metal fans, especially of a band named ""Powermad"", whose music exquisitely punctuates many sequences, including some sublime dance scenes. In the first half, important scenes are set in New Orleans, with the familiar unsettling undertone that that locale often has in films--you can just smell the voodoo, sex, drugs and death bubbling beneath the skin of the city. Later scenes are set in the desolate, desert prairie country of Texas, which turns out to be even more unsettling (even though I really find such places refreshing and relaxing). There are other kinds of symbolic, stylistic and literal references worked into the film, such as the constant fire motif, which Lynch shoots beautifully, but the above is to just give you an idea of the stew.It all seems like it should add up to some subtextual grand narrative, and maybe it does, but I haven't quite figured out what it all means yet. But it doesn't matter. The stylistic flourishes are ingenious superficially, too, and maybe Lynch _is_ just poking fun at being Lynch. Here, perhaps more than in any other work, he has found the perfect balance between the soap-operatic and the utterly bizarre--the filmic equivalent to author Harry Crews' best work.Tarantino doesn't tend to have pithy subtexts in his films, either, but they're no worse the wear for that, and when Wild at Heart takes a turn into typical Tarantino territory, Lynch is just as captivating, gritty and groovy, plus he's doing it before Tarantino himself. At the same time, Lynch manages to maintain a parallel lush, erotic romance between Sailor and Lula--Dern is incredibly sexy/sensuous here. This material works as well, and supplies what just may be the message of the film after all--that love can (eventually) conquer all, even the stuff that's ""wild at heart and weird on top"".",Wild at Heart
51,seymourblack-1,"Wild, Weird & Wonderful",9,8 January 2011,"""Wild At Heart"" is an entertaining fantasy about a rebellious couple in love who go on the run to escape the troubles and violence which have blighted their lives in the past. On their journey they share passion, danger and conversations about their backgrounds as they get to know each other better. Theirs is a story which is heavily steeped in pop culture as illustrated by the movie's soundtrack, the numerous allusions to ""The Wizard Of Oz"" and their Elvis and Marilyn personas but it's also a story of hope as they try to escape to a better and more peaceful life together.Sailor Ripley (Nicolas Cage) and Lula Pace Fortune (Laura Dern) are very much in love but Lula's mother Marietta (Diane Ladd) will go to any lengths to keep them apart and so hires a thug to kill Sailor. Sailor kills his assailant in self defence but ends up in prison after being found guilty of manslaughter. On his release, Lula meets him at the gates and in an act which violates the terms of his parole; they decide to run away to California.The extremely determined and completely unhinged Marietta responds to this situation by hiring one of her boyfriends, a private detective called Johnnie Farragut (Harry Dean Stanton) to find the couple and bring Lula home and then later hires another boyfriend Marcellus Santos (J.E.Freeman) to kill Sailor.When the couple reach Big Tuna, Texas, Lula is pregnant and they start to run short of money. Sailor gets to know a criminal called Bobby Peru (Willem Dafoe) and then later agrees to carry out a robbery with him. Peru is a reckless psychopath who threatens to rape Lula, unnecessarily shoots two people during the robbery and also sets Sailor up to be killed because he'd been hired to do so by one of Santos' gangster associates called Mr Reindeer (William Morgan Sheppard).Sailor is subsequently given a five year sentence for his part in the robbery and on his release, Lula meets him with their son. An important decision then has to be made about what's best for the family's future and the course of action that Sailor takes is determined by an extraordinary and fantastic intervention from a very unexpected source.Nicolas Cage is sensational as he portrays his character's ability to be brutal and violent as well as charming and caring. His Elvis-style drawl and his renditions of two of the King's ballads are terrific and the way he delivers some of his great lines is brilliant and hilarious at the same time. Examples of this are his speech about the significance of his snakeskin jacket, the occasion when he exclaims ""rockin' good news"" and also when he says to Lula ""the way your head works is God's own private mystery"".Lula is strangely naive but also profoundly damaged by being raised in a family where both her mother and her cousin Dell (Crispin Glover) were insane and where her mother arranged to have her father killed in a fire. Add to this her childhood experience of being raped and having an abortion and the extent of her psychological baggage becomes clearer. Laura Dern captures Lula's contradictions and spontaneity perfectly in a performance which is absolutely flawless throughout.Diane Ladd's performance as the mad and murderous Marietta is wild and powerful and she dominates the screen every time she appears in the action.""Wild At Heart"" was directed with great flair and adapted for the screen (from Barry Gifford's novel) by David Lynch whose style is both colourful and surreal. Lynch's preoccupation with all things eccentric, bizarre and off-beat can often be unsettling or extremely funny but in the case of this movie is especially effective as it complements the fantastic and fairytale quality of the material so perfectly.",Wild at Heart

53,TheUnknown837-1,Mr. Lynch's mastery is present in every single frame. What brings down his movie is that his story is only potentially interesting,5,9 April 2011,"There is a scene in David Lynch's ""Wild at Heart"" that, I think, defines the meaning of the word classic. Nicolas Cage, perfectly matched to the role of an Elvis-like tramp in a snakeskin jacket, actually sings ""Love Me Tender."" Mr. Cage does his own singing and man, does he have a voice! The scene, beautifully shot and magnificently directed by Mr. Lynch, is mesmerizing. If this isn't memorable, then I just don't know what is. However, paradoxical as it sounds, this very scene is evidence of the film's downfall. How come? Because not only is this the best scene in the movie, it's the one where the credits are scrolling over. The last shot in the movie upstages everything that came before it.The sad thing is that this parody/homage to ""The Wizard of Oz"" based on a novel by Barry Gifford (which I have not read) suffers from a story that is only potentially interesting. As it opens, Sailor Ripley (Mr. Cage) kills a hit-man coming after him with a knife and is sentenced to prison. Upon being released, he and his girlfriend Lula (Laura Dern) embark on a wild and rampant road trip composed of them dancing, drinking, and lovemaking...a lot. All would be going well for them, if it weren't for the fact that Lula's mother (Miss Dern's real-life mother, Diane Ladd) is still out to see Sailor dead.How does this resemble ""The Wizard of Oz""? Well, without giving too much away, it accomplish it because it Mr. Lynch is, probably without doubt, the most daring surrealist in the business today. And his craftsmanship and humor is omnipresent at all times. Some have objected to this picture because of its violence or its, to quote one critic, ""sly excuses."" But that is not what bothers me about ""Wild at Heart."" What made it fall flat for me was because, in spite of Mr. Lynch's mastery, there was very little of anything for him to really work with here.The first half of the movie is essentially a retread of the same thing. We see Sailor and Lula on their erotic adventures and we see the mother, Marietta, scheming and planning. That wears thin rather quickly. In the second half, we get a little more energy and a little more going on, with some plot twists, but by that point, I was completely exhausted by the redundancy of what preceded it.There are great performances in the movie. Mr. Cage and Miss Dern are sexy and work extremely well together. Miss Ladd, nominated by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for this film, is superb and screen-commanding, Harry Dean Stanton makes for yet another excellent straight man, and Willem Dafoe is absolutely brilliant as a sneaky, snarling scoundrel with an eye for trouble. The lovely Isabella Rossellini also makes a small appearance. But none of these actors, in spite of their talent, have interesting characters or dynamics to build themselves up on. The central love story between Sailor and Lula is only passionate in ostensible terms; there is little in the name of chemistry here. Miss Ladd's motives are cheap and sometimes hard to follow, making her a dismissible villain. Mr. Dafoe is interesting while he's on screen, but is forgotten as soon as he's not anymore.The movie just rumbles along like the characters' cars, going over the same territory and scenario again and again. When a twist comes, and we have to wait a whole hour for that, it's intended shock is dumbed down by the monotonous nature of what came before it. The dialog, written by director Lynch, shows traces of the wit that he so magnificently assembled in ""Blue Velvet"" but only traces. On and on it goes up until its great ending scene. And once that had concluded, I sat there aghast for I had realized a key flaw in the movie. There was a long-going plot element involving Miss Ladd and a couple of monotonous baddies played by J.E. Freeman and William Morgan Shepphard, and out of the blue, the movie completely forgot about it. Was it intended? I don't know and frankly, I don't care because it meant so little when compared to the amass of boredom I had to suffer through.There are some very fine moments, especially the ending scene, and again, Mr. Lynch's mastery is evident in every single frame. But ""Wild at Heart"" suffers from a dumbed-down story lacking any real passionate spark and instead of dousing me with excitement, plunged me into ennui within twenty minutes. It's endurable, but not memorable. It's not up there with Mr. Lynch's greats like ""The Elephant Man"" and, what I feel is his best, ""Blue Velvet."" Toward the end, there is a scene, completing Mr. Lynch's homage to ""The Wizard of Oz"" where a characters lectures to Mr. Cage that he should never ""turn away from love."" That's good advice. Better advice would be to turn away from this movie.",Wild at Heart
54,Mister-6,"Weird at ""Heart""....",1,10 November 1999,"No one goes into a David Lynch movie expecting a normal viewing experience.But what do you come out with when you've seen a movie that cross-breeds a road movie with ""Bonnie and Clyde"", ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Blue Velvet"" (Lynch's previous film)?  Headache, nausea, dizziness and slurred speech, that's what.This is not a movie, it's a litmus test for how far a movie can go and how much it can get away with.  And obviously, the MPAA didn't let it get away with TOO much.  But enough, to be sure.As Sailor (Cage) and Lula (Dern) make their way through a bizarre world replete with oddball characters, twisted situations and nihilistic scenes of violence, it's kind of hard to juxtapose these with scenes of Glinda the Good Witch and Dern clicking her heels to get back home. 
Lynch tries to make a joke of the whole thing: blood, guts, severed hands and heads and all, but this is the kind of humor you're more apt to get if you're into jokes about death, dismemberment and a lack of overall morals. 
The only scene I did like in this whole mess is set in a dance club, where Cage roughs up a guy trying to put the moves on Dern, makes him apologize, has the guy get himself a beer and then jumps up with the band and breaks into an Elvis song while the girls in the club squeal and scream for joy.

56,KnightsofNi11,"Very experimental, but not Lynch's best",6,28 December 2010,"Throw all preconceptions of what you think a movie should or can be before watching David Lynch's disturbingly bizarre and highly experimental Wild at Heart. Everything comes loose for this odd tale of romance, horror, and disgust. It's about an oddball couple named Sailor and Lula, played excessively by Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern respectively. Sailor has just gotten out of jail and so he and Lula decide to break his parole and drive cross country to places like New Orleans and the little town of Big Tuna, Texas. Lula's mother hires a strange assortment of assassins to track down her daughter and her boyfriend and kill him. From here we are unexpectedly delivered a grotesque amount of shocking twists and turns that make you cringe with every strikingly disgusting moment of the film. It can be enjoyed, but it can also tip the film off the deep end into insanity, turning it into an in-cohesive and disturbing mess of a film. It's very raw and very experimental on Lynch's part, and I can respect him for that, but the final outcome left me feeling disturbed and deranged, rather than impressed.I can't bring myself to say that Wild at Heart is a bad film. It's not. It has lots of issues, but they are all issues brought about by Lynch developing a lot of his surreal and twisted style that he has perfected since then. Wild at Heart is very unpolished and unperfected, and that is something that definitely keeps it interesting. It is a very surreal experience, but so much so that you get lost in what it is trying to accomplish. The film is excessively weird and relies a lot on shock value from the audience. There are a lot of incredibly bizarre moments that break any and all cohesion this film has and it just drives it deeper into its deranged self. Lynch uses this film to experiment and toy with the art of cinema and storytelling through the abstract and surreal. The final outcome may have not been all there, but his motives are clear and the goal of the film is in sight, just slightly out of reach because of all the ridiculous oddities strewn about in the film.The characters in this film are just as bizarre as the style in which Lynch portrays them. The two leads are very disgusting and obscene characters that are hard to like, and they are also just plain weird. They aren't good people and they aren't respectable people. Plus the actors portraying them make them into caricatures more than multi-dimensional characters. Laura Dern acts her heart out, but plays it up in the most insane and wacky manner. Nicholas Cage takes it a step further and plays Sailor as the most overzealous and obnoxiously excitable character. I couldn't stand him. I'm not a Cage fan anyways, but his performance in this film was just ridiculous. The rest of the cast feel like adrenaline fueled nut jobs as well. I didn't feel any sympathy or remorse for any of the characters, but they are definitely strange enough to give the film its consistently off beat feel.The bottom line is that this film is insane. It gets pretty lost in itself, and definitely takes a dive into the dark pit of insanity. You have to be prepared going into this film because it is unlike anything you've seen before, as is the case with David Lynch films. Wild at Heart is a difficult film to get immersed in and you will certainly spend a lot of your time doing double takes and questioning why some of the bizarre and chilling depictions of sex and violence are being displayed on your screen and what ultimate purpose they are serving. This film has a right to be part of David Lynch's lineup of films though because it has a lot of bearing on where Lynch's style would go from there. The film is so surreal and so experimental that it loses a lot of its impact, but if you look at it through an experimental and artistic lens, it plays an important role in the David Lynch legacy. I didn't love this film but I can't hate it either. And as with most David Lynch films, I definitely feel like Wild at Heart deserves a few more viewings before I write it off as just another film.",Wild at Heart
57,mario_c,Nice movie but with a disappointing ending,8,18 April 2007,"""Wild at Heart"" is a road-movie from David Lynch which tell us the love story between Lula (Laura Dern) and Saylor (Nicolas Cage). It's a thriller about a twisted story of love, death, murder and betrayal, but it ends in a very smooth and romantic way It's the first time I saw ""Wild at Heart"" from the beginning to the end. I had already seen some parts of the movie before, but I hadn't seen the whole movie. On one hand it surprised me a bit since it's closer to the ""usual"" kind of cinema by David Lynch than I initially thought: It has mysterious and bizarre characters, close camera shots, weird dreams, uncontrolled burning flames, excellent soundtrack (and perfectly combined with the scenes), and many other features that we can see in other Lynch's films. But on the other hand I was disappointed by its ending This movie, unlike his recent films, has a straight plot, one ""easy"" to understand, but OK, I was expecting it, so there's no problem about thatbut that ending! It really disappointed me! So smooth, so romantic, so sweet I can't recognize David Lynch there! With a different and more ""Lynchian"" ending I would score this film with a 9/10, but because of that I can't score it more than 8/10!",Wild at Heart

This is clearly a bit of a make-weight given that the plot is pretty thin (almost a standard road movie with bells and whistles)  and not altogether life affirming.

60,emm,"Inventive, bleak romance drama has power",7,11 December 1999,"A real stimulatingly offbeat exhibition from Lynch is the dark and wild backdrop of a romantically engaged traveling pair: ""Sailor"" who is on parole after committing a brutal murder, and ""Lula"" whose mother demands her to return from a spoiled trip to Texas with help from a detective. It's a twisted, artsy journey that is often repulsive and long to boot (and certainly not for the squeamish!), but fares inventive at a certain degree and boasts some of the strongest performances ever worked on a Lynch film, perhaps even in 1990.

Nicholas Cage is Elvis and Laura Dern is Dorothy (her real life mother plays the Wicked Witch) in this post-modern allegory on fairy-tales and violence. Being a Lynch movie, this is never out-right said, only implied through image and action.  Having been made in 1990, and subsequently winning the top prize at Cannes, the film was latter ravaged by critics yet paved the way for a string of films in the mid-1990's that defined a generation of film-makers lead by the likes of Tarantino.  There never would have been a reception for ""True Romance,"" ""Pulp Fiction,"" or ""Natural Born Killers"" if it weren't for Lynch's folly that actually plays pretty well (and with much hilarity) all these years later now that this genre seems to have run itself into the ground.  Kudos to Dafoe for out-Dafoeing himself and making himself truly the ugliest character to ever grace the screen (those teeth! that death scene! WOW).  Also, an oddity for Lynch, in that it seems to have an overtly happy (and rocking good time!) ending.  A must for Lynch fans, or anyone who love the movies they love more than they love Movies.",Wild at Heart
63,asda-man,Not to be confused with ITV's rubbish,9,13 July 2012,"""Wild At Heart"" is my first real taste of a David Lynch film. The only other film of Dave's I've seen is ""The Elelephant Man"" and although it is an extraordinary and moving film, it restricts David's trademark weirdness and motifs as it's based on a tragic true story. I've been wanting to get a taste of David Lynch for a while because I'm into weird, over-the-top films and so when ""Wild At Heart"" popped up on ITV (not the crap wildlife drama) I had to give it a record. I have to say that I was pretty impressed and I'm looking forward to other films her has to offer.I would describe Lynch's style as Quentin Tarantino on acid. It's even more over the top in its editing, directing and music than most Quentin films. I absolutely loved Wild At Heart's energy, it has a fantastic pace and doesn't remain dull for a moment until it reaches its final half hour or so. The beginning keeps you immediately hooked with its fantastic over-the-top pantomime characters, especially the mother who is played with psychotic and sometimes frightening spirit by Diane Ladd. Nicholas Cage gives a typically wooden performance, whereas his partner (Laura Dern) in crime has a much more likable spirit.It's just a shame that the film seems to lose its focus about more than halfway through. The mother suddenly becomes absent and her presence is lost. The twisty and revealing flashbacks also go a miss, making the viewing less gripping. Things also start to feel repetitious when the duo encounter the car accident, the formula of dance, have sex, drive begins to where thin and the introductions of more hit men become incredibly confusing and surreal! However, there is a great use of colour throughout with the red and yellow conveying the idea of flames to create a clever fiery atmosphere.When the duo meet the super creepy Willem Dafoe (looking unbelievably frightening- prepare to have nightmares) the pace starts to slow and it's only the scenes with Willem that gain attention as things begin to lose focus. Although, there is a a fantastically creepy robbery sequence that will stay with you for an eternity. After this things begin to rebuild its focus, building up to a brilliant and clever finale.I also liked the ""Wizard of Oz"" references dotted throughout and its use of music. Overall, it's certainly a film that is worth seeing and if the film didn't lose its focus and had a good ten minutes cut down, then I'm certain that I would be branding this a masterpiece. However, unfortunately it doesn't quite reach that status despite it still being tremendously likable. I shall look forward to ""Mulholland Drive"" and ""Blue Velvet"" especially from Lynch.EDIT: Having now watched and loved Inland Empire, Twin Peaks (1/4 through series 2) and Mulholland Drive (which is now one of my favourite films of all time) I am, professionally speaking, in love with David Lynch. When I revisited Wild At Heart again last night I enjoyed it much more than the last time. I liked how the pace slowed down in the second half with Willem Dafoe as it gave the film a more dream-like quality which is something David is incredibly good at doing. Although, I still wouldn't brand Wild At Heart as a masterpiece, it still isn't far off and I'd urge people who've only seen it once to see it again in a different light.",Wild at Heart
64,bregund,"What do you know, a Lynch film worse than Dune",3,6 September 2018,"As bad as Dune was, it had some interesting acting, and some of the book's ideas survived the transfer to film, and you could connect to Paul Atreides. Clearly marked heroes and villains make a passable film. I don't know what to make of this noisy mess, there's lots of swearing, sex, filthy language, drinking, smoking, violence, bodily fluids, none of which has any context to anything, it's just there for shock value I suppose. What possible purpose do multiple references to vomit on the floor serve? Several characters remark about the smell and discuss the presence of the vomit, and there's a closeup of it in case you need a reminder of what vomit looks like, but Lula, a paragon of delicate femininity, doesn't bother to clean it up. All of the characters are ugly, misshapen caricatures incapable of depth, humanity, continuity, or clarity. Diane Ladd's performance is interesting I suppose, but her character's motivations have nothing to bounce from, it's all crazy, all the time; it's nothing special, I can see that down at the bus station. Give me a reason for the lunacy and I can connect with it. The Elephant Man didn't have to make sense, the common thread that ran through the film grounded it, and all the artistic flights of fancy returned to the central theme. Same thing with Eraserhead, it's a dream, I get it. But Wild at Heart is a mess from beginning to end.",Wild at Heart
65,Ali_John_Catterall,Lynch puts the odd in 'odyssey',5,12 November 2009,"By 1990, David Lynch was the foremost surrealist of US cinema, a position cemented by Eraserhead, Blue Velvet and his long-running cult TV series 'Twin Peaks', a bizarre deconstructed soap. As a director-for-hire, he'd also displayed versatility for tackling more mainstream fare as evinced by The Elephant Man and Dune, with plaudits for the former and critical brickbats for the latter.Lynchian cinema was more popular in Europe than on his home turf, and came to be synonymous with the perception of the director himself, a former all-American boy (and latterly, Ronald Reagan admirer) distorted by a funhouse mirror to resemble, as Elephant Man producer Mel Brooks wryly observed, ""Jimmy Stewart from Mars"". The repressed, ultra-conservative ""I Like Ike"" generation had some very peculiar stuff in its closet. Lynch made it his currency.After 'Twin Peaks', expectations were at fever pitch for Lynch's next project. The director came across Barry Gifford's novella 'Wild At Heart' while still in its proofing stages and fashioned a loose adaptation in six days. Unusually for Lynch, the script's pretty straightforward and chronological; as Wild At Heart star Dafoe noted later, ""I was always shocked at how logical it was - its world was so complete."" But as ever, El Diablo's in the details.Here, Blue Velvet's yuppie nightmare becomes a white trash ticket to Hell: reckless Sailor Ripley (Cage, in full-on Elvis mode) loves hopeless romantic Lula Fortune (Dern), which drives Marietta Fortune (played by Dern's real-life mother Ladd) round the twist. After her lascivious advances to Sailor are spurned, she sends a hit-man after him, who Sailor kills - graphically, smashing his skull to splinters. On release from prison and defying his probation for ""manslaughter"", Sailor and lusty Lula hit the pedal for California, encountering all manner of Lynchian freaks en route. Unbeknown to them, Lula's insanely jealous mother has hired seedy PI Johnnie Farragut (Stanton) and various thugs to hunt them down, culminating in a stand-off in one-horse-town 'Big Tuna' with evil gunman Bobby Peru (Dafoe).A dream turning inexorably to nightmare, Wild At Heart's an all-out assault on the senses, aided immeasurably by Angelo Badalamenti's fantastically smoky score. But the director's trademark oddities (from obese prom queens and cockroach-bothering relatives to Ladd's hellish, red lipstick-covered face) seem forced, and unlike Eraserhead there's scant emotional heart.With deliberately over-the-top performances (from Ladd and Defoe, particularly), characterisation always takes a back seat to knowing iconography, along with campy references to The Wizard Of Oz - Dern imagines Ladd as the Wicked Witch of the West, while 'Twin Peaks' star Sheryl Lee portrays Glinda.Nevertheless, amid catcalls and cheers - and much to Lynch's bemusement - the film won the Palme d'Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival; a fitting opener to a decade which would see the director's post-modern riff on American pop-culture become de rigeur in independent US cinema, ultimately achieving more cross-over successes than Lynch ever imagined.",Wild at Heart
66,Angeneer,A modern classic,9,20 July 2001,"Perhaps David Lynch's chef d'oeuvre, this film works so well in so many layers one might be left satisfied by only having paid attention to the slightest and most obvious one - the love story. The final scene has already made it to the pantheon of the most recognizable ones in cinematic history. But of course, if it was only that, it wouldn't be a Lynch movie. Dark humor, unpredictability, gratuitous gore, great angles and fantastic music (from metal to Elvis to classical) compose the whole picture. Let's not forget Willem Dafoe, an unbelievably cool character with one of the best deaths depicted on celluloid!",Wild at Heart
67,DavidSim240183,Barmy. Bizarre. Beautiful!,10,16 August 2007,"For such a downright bizarre film, Wild at Heart has got a surprisingly large cult following. Even though its wacky, surreal and completely out there, people love debating this film. They love to ponder it. And I must confess...so do I.If you're familiar with David Lynch's work, then you know what a kooky filmmaker he is. He's right up there with Tim Burton. Maybe even more so. A lot of Lynch's films come with an absurdist atmosphere that is at times infuriatingly difficult to crack. But it is worth the effort. Beneath the surrealism and oddball characters packed into his films is a rich and fascinating subtext. And Wild at Heart is one of Lynch's most absorbing efforts.Wild at Heart takes the basics of a road trip formula, and transforms it into a stunning journey of self-expression as well as discovery. Lynch would explore this territory again to equally breathtaking effect in the beautifully resonant The Straight Story, by far his best film.The film focuses on a modern day pair of star-crossed lovers, Sailor Ripley and Lula Fortune (Nicolas Cage & Laura Dern). Lula is dominated by her obsessive control freak of a mother, Marietta (Diane Ladd, Dern's real life mother). But Sailor opens Lula's eyes to a world beyond her mother's front door. Alas, Sailor ends up in prison for two years after he kills a man sent by Marietta to kill him.While on parole, he hooks up with Lula, and the two set off on the journey of their lives. All the while, Marietta sends numerous PI's and hit men after them to kill Sailor once and for all.It may take some time for Wild at Heart to work its magic over you. Because its quite a difficult film to enjoy at times. But it is a near-masterpiece. You just have to look hard enough.All the most rewarding moments are between Cage and Dern. Their scenes together crackle with a real voracious, sexual kick. And Lynch knows that too. He shoots many of their lovemaking scenes in a dangerous red. To the point that it becomes unbearable. These are lovers with energy to burn. Which might explain the frequent closeups of smoked cigarettes to symbolise that point.And Lynch utilises Angelo Badalamenti's musical score to exhilarating effect. Alternately moody. Wistful. Tragic. The music is so accessible and perfectly attuned to the material it almost tells a story in of itself.Of all the films Nicolas Cage has starred in, Wild at Heart must count as his finest. The character of Sailor is a part that fits him like a glove. A travelling dreamer who defiantly defends his individuality in a world out to crush his free-thinking spirit. And although Sailor has no desire for violence, he is prepared to use it when he sees which way the wind is blowing. Cage also gets to show off his surprisingly fine singing voice. Doing some pretty nifty Elvis impersonations.Laura Dern is also at the top of her game here. At first glance, Lula appears to be a brainless piece of trailer-trash. But Lynch uses an interesting technique of multilayered flashback sequences to penetrate the levels of Lula's past. And over the course of the film, through a combination of Dern's acting and Lynch's direction, Lula engages your sympathies without you even realising.Diane Ladd turns in an astonishingly broad performance that threatens to teeter into parody at any moment. But the surprising thing is, her OTT theatrics are quite in character. That may go over your head the first time. But she does know when to dial it down. Her relationship with her daughter is quite an astute blend of domineering control and genuine concern. Although it may take several viewings before you pick up on that.Wild at Heart is punctuated with frequent layers of bizarreness. Some hover at the edges. Others spill over into the narrative. Such as Willem Dafoe's Bobby Peru, a detestable louse who ropes Sailor into crime. The scene where he corners Lula in a motel room, threatening her into sexual submission is not only alarming, but physically draining. You are quite relieved when that scene is over.The film is also mind-bogglingly obsessed with the Wizard of Oz. References crop up everywhere. Sailor and Lula's road-trip is compared to the Yellow Brick road. In Lula's mind, her mother resembles the Wicked Witch of the West. And at the height of inspired lunacy, Sailor receives a divine vision from Glinda, the Good Witch of the North (played by none other than Twin Peaks' Laura Palmer!), who inspires him to renew his relationship with Lula.As things draw to a close, it seems for a time our hopes for Sailor and Lula's love will be dashed. And Lynch does a superb job making it seem that way. But the final scene, when Sailor sings Love Me Tender to Lula, the song he promised to sing to his wife is a scene that's quite lovely. And you realise its a moment the whole film has been building up to. I love the way it plays out over the end credits. It ends the film on the perfect note.Touching. Disturbing. Never less than inspiring, Wild at Heart is a searing love story beautifully played by all. And one of David Lynch's most intriguing films to date.",Wild at Heart

I thought Diane Ladd as Marietta was truly excellent and Willem Defoe was also great as the sleazy Bobby Peru. You cannot fail to notice the many references to 'The Wizard of Oz'; a theme that runs throughout. Unfortunately I found the film ran too long, there's only so long you can put up with all the craziness. It reaches a point where we lose one of the main threads that have been running through the first two thirds of the film and I found that quite distracting.

This movie disturbed me quite a bit but also blew me away and it is a great addition to my David Lynch collection.I thought the story of Wild at Heart was the greatest part, which should be true with any great film. It is disturbing and intense with awesome references to Elvis and The Wizard of Oz. It is bizarre but much more accessible than most of his films. And though I prefer his ambiguous films, this is definitely top notch as well.Acting doesn't get much better than this. Laura Dern is awesome as well as Diane Ladd, Willem Dafoe, Harry Dean Stanton and even Nicolas Cage, who I usually hate. They were all wonderful and really brought a lot of life to their characters.

72,jackasstrange,"Charmous, weird and fascinating. This is Wild at Heart.",8,13 November 2013,"In the early screenings of 'Wild at Heart', it was extremely bad received, with about 80 persons walking out of it in the first two days, whose a good majority of them were complaining mostly about the graphic and gruesome depiction of violence, or the intense sex scenes,and even about the crude profanities spelled in the film. What a poor reasons. Seriously, it's a great film regardless if it is too strong or not. It's a very good film. And i'll say why it's so good.Lynch's use of references of the pop culture such as the popular fantasy film Wizard of Oz and the Elvis Presley's films fits well in the environment of Wild at Heart. It even softly calms down a few tense situations, due to an spoof feeling on it. The abundant use of the 'hot' colors in this film, to portray a 'wild' atmosphere, are masterfully used as well. The plot it's everything but clever though. This is somewhat obvious,because we're talking about David Lynch, whose content of his films are always expected to be very obscure. But if it helps, Lynch himself said that the film's main intention is to show 'how to love in the hell'. I really think he did the mission very well then. So, in a short resume, Wild at Heart is a film full of pointless dialogs, pop references, sex and violence, all mixed with a stunning cinematography. If you are planing to watch it, i highly recommend you to do so. 8.3/10",Wild at Heart
73,x_manicure_x,Over the top,8,14 August 2021,"Unlike everyone says, ""Wild at Heart"" is far from being David Lynch's worst film. Actually, there is a part of me that even thinks it's a masterpiece. As a parody, it doesn't have the gloomy atmosphere of ""Blue Velvet"", but personally, I found it even more extreme and uncompromising. I understand that it could be a bit too much to handle though: the cartoonish characters and the cheap soap opera overacting that characterized Twin Peaks are not for everyone, and the pulpy sex and gore make everything feel even more grotesque. I mean, people's brains getting blown out, continuous Wizard of Oz references, and Nic Cage singing Elvis songs and dancing with karate chops at a power metal gig, all in the same movie! Retrospectively we can describe it as a Tarantino-style movie, but we should not forget that Tarantino was not even close to debuting at the time ""Wild at Heart"" was shot.The plot is partly based on the pulp-noir novel of the same name, and is overall pretty straightforward: Lula and Sailor are two rebels in love who decide to hit the road so that no-one can drive them apart anymore. Lula's mother is an evil witch who sends a private eye and a hitman after them. Lynch decides to add all kinds of weird diversions along the way, with some of the craziest, creepiest characters he ever created. More than the original story itself, these diversions are the things that make the film truly memorable. Unlike ""Twin Peaks"" and ""Blue Velvet"", there is no light to balance the sleaze and darkness, no coffee and cherry pie after the nightmare. Lula and Sailor are naive and madly in love, but they just feel like cheap and shallow caricatures, you couldn't care less about them.I understand that the movie aims at creating a world and characters rather than just telling a coherent story, but some focus on the plot wouldn't have hurt. Mr. Reindeer, the Durango gang and Marcellus Santos are iconic characters with their own story arcs, but the film forgets about them halfway through. Marietta even gets ""erased"" for convenience. Willem Dafoe as Bobby Peru is one of the creepiest Lynchian villains ever, but gets disposed of a bit too easily. It's like they shot what they could and then abruptly closed the film with a pre-made happy ending.Regardless, the countless iconic scenes and over the top pulp still make ""Wild at Heart"" one of my personal David Lynch favorites.",Wild at Heart
74,ilpohirvonen,David Lynch gave us a story of a totally shattered society.,8,14 February 2010,"David Lynch who was making the famous TV-series Twin Peaks, decided to make a film at the same year, called Wild At Heart. He used his usual crew, for instance Angelo Badalamenti who also composed the music for Twin Peaks. Laura Dern is also well known from Lynch's Blue Velvet (1987) and no one but Laura worked with David Lynch again from this crew. In a documentary ""Il était une fois... Sailor et Lula"" (2009) most of the people who worked with Wild at Heart told that the project was just so exhausting. Even Lauran Dern said that she was shattered after the film was finished.The movie is very hard to put in a genre (like most Lynch's movies), but I would consider it as a romance/drama/road-movie, since it deals with love and family issues on the road. People who mostly watch mainstream films, would probably find this movie sick and twisted. But for people who watch a lot of movies from Lynch or not, will probably find this very interesting, affecting and entertaining.It's about a criminal, called Sailor (Nicolas Cage) who runs away with her girlfriend Lula (Laura Dern) across the southern states. Lula's mother (Diane Ladd) sends few killers after Sailor to save her daughter. David Lynch has put the world of 1990 into Sailor and Lula's life. What we see in their life is a totally shattered family structure, a shattered society. Among this it deals with death, despair and how crazy all the people have gone.This obviously is a postmodern film and it's surrealism as most of Lynch's movies are. The music is also outstanding, modern and different. As I mentioned Lynch used the same composer (Angelo Badalamenti), that he used with Twin Peaks. But in addition to that, Lynch mixed some old Rock 'N Roll like Elvis with new Heavy Metal, which expressed the rage and frustration of the characters brilliantly.So David Lynch is dealing with reality through surrealism. His world view in this film is dark: the world full of misery, death, violence, hatred and horror. While watching you might think that David Lynch is sick, the whole movie is sick and that's the world view Lynch is showing. We're supposed to feel sick, the world around us is sick.""This whole world's wild at heart and weird on top."" This is what Lula Fortune said to Sailor Ripley and it's pretty much what this movie is about.I don't know why Wild at Heart has a low rating over here, maybe because of its originality (Not that low, but compared to other Lynch-films). In the documentary I mentioned before, they said that this movie was a flop in the United States but a big success in France. I can clearly see why, the narrative partly reminded me of the French style. And people in Europe are more used to artistic films, I'm not talking about all the people, but generally speaking.8/10 A great postmodern film, which also was Nicolas Cage's best performance. A violent story about the world we live in.",Wild at Heart

It's a typical Nick Cage film (barring the initial first few), in which the dialog is stilted, the acting high-schoolish. I can't believe Laura Dern and her mother - an Oscar winner - agreed to this film. I'm not sure why Lynch has a good reputation, as this film is just amateurish. Rarely do I not finish a movie, but couldn't take more than an hour of this crap",Wild at Heart
76,Silverzero,"Joltingly violent, shockingly erotic retelling of `The Wizard of Oz'.",10,18 July 2003,"Upon hearing the words `David Lynch', dozens of words spring to mind. `Weirdo, bizarre, insane, articulate, violent, erotic, and above all else, crazy'. Such is the case with the cult classic `Wild at Heart'- the movie which epitomises his very existence. The styles and characteristics rank to a very acquired taste. If you are the slightest bit squeamish, then give this film a miss. But if you can take it, then you'll find `Wild at Heart' to be one of the oddest cinematic experiences in history.
The plot may seem simple enough, but there are plenty of surreal and indefinable elements thrown in, to make sure that you will not forget this movie for a long, long time. As he has done in the past, the notoriously perverse director explores the underbelly of sex and violence that lurks in southern America. He definitely succeeds in what he sets out to do  single-handedly destroy the American dream. Not only that, he tramples over it several times and then shreds it up in a lawnmower. The end result is a bleak, over-violent road movie given the extra surreal touches along with far too many ferociously explicit sex scenes. This is a very loose retelling of `The Wizard of Oz', and one that certainly won't have you look at the former the same way again. Our two main characters  Sailor and Lula are the star-crossed lovers who travel across the country (the road supposedly representing the Yellow Brick Road), much to the chagrin of Lula's mother (the Wicked Witch?). By the end, they've encountered many deranged psychos and even a delightfully odd visit from Glinda the Good Witch. For the most part, this is a guilty displeasure (if such a thing exists). One receives a voyeuristic sense whilst watching the movie. Instead of being compelling, this is more often mind numbing, but as the scenes become increasingly insane, you can't stop watching it. And by the end, it leaves a surprisingly good taste despite all that proceeds.
Never funny enough to make you laugh, never realistic enough to leave you shocked but never boring enough to have you repelled. It continuously dizzies the mind enough to make you believe that through all the blood and perversity, there is an invigorating story. Effectively eccentric performances all round from a good cast. Nicholas Cage, snakeskin jacket in tow, is always believable as the parolee- turned criminal. And what a beautiful singing voice (hee-hee). A 35-year-old Laura Dern doesn't for a second pass for a 20-year-old. But the accent is top-notch and the white-trash characteristics are exemplary. An Oscar nominated Diane Ladd makes for a thoroughly engrossing character. But Willem Dafoe steals the show as ultra-psycho Bobby Peru- intimidating, odd and psychotic. Underused support is generated from a supporting cast including Crispin Glover, Issabella Rossellini and Harry Dean Stanton. The abnormal bravura styles of David Lynch leave their mark, bringing the movie style, violence and surrealness, but no heart. A captivating, often insane and consistently shocking cinematic experience, this bleak oddessy through a hellish landscape is audacious and deserving of its status of a cult-classic. While it will probably only appeal to about 6% of the world, this is a dazzling, dark and strangely vivid movie. My IMDb rating: 7.4/10.",Wild at Heart

82,Sober-Friend,The First Torture Porn Film,7,1 August 2017,"In 1990 David Lynch was an all time career peak. His television show ""Twin Peaks"" had the greatest reviews of all time for a television show. The show debut in April. One month later ""Wild at Heart"" would win the Canne Film Festival however not everyone loved this film and there seem to be many boo's when it was announced that it did win. It easy to see why this film had such a polarizing effect. It is a very violent and very sexual. It pushes the limits on what content should be allowed in a ""R RATED FILM"" before it is given a more restricted NC- 17 rating. ""Wild at Heart"" is a film that you won't forget once you see it. It is one of those where most people will ""Love"" or ""Hate"". Now I was and still am a ""Twin Peaks"" fan. I was looking forward to seeing this film. However this film I do not love. To me it pushed the envelope way too far. If a scene was violent it was graphic in sexual content. Here is the story:In this film After serving prison time for a self-defense killing, Sailor Ripley (Nicolas Cage) reunites with girlfriend Lula Fortune (Laura Dern). Lula's mother, Marietta (Diane Ladd), desperate to keep them apart, hires a hit man to kill Sailor.If this film was shorter or ""Toned down"" I might have enjoyed it more. However even now I am very hesitant to watch it. If you can get through the first 15 minutes and then you will be okay. If you find it too much then you might want to know it only gets more graphic. Not the the Best David Lynch Film. However if you have a great sound system then put this on and pump up the volume!",Wild at Heart

William Dafoe's part is really haunting too, especially how he is introduced to us, the way he comes out of the dark. If you liked Blue Velvet you are bound to like this one.

85,blakiepeterson,A Fiendishly Wild Road Movie,8,2 May 2015,"The camera gazes upward at what appears to be the ceiling of a ritzy mansion, swing music frolicking in the background. Capital letters suddenly appear on the screen, announcing that the location of this swing music adoring home is in Cape Fear, somewhere near the border between North and South Carolina. One can almost feel the rush of an air- conditioned breeze after a romp in the sun. Guests only come inside for a glass of bubbly and a leather chair to reflect on. A party is going on. We meet it at its exit, Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern trotting down the chandelier lit staircase in an effort to find some fun elsewhere. But a man stops them. You see, he has caught wind of a certain incident (allegedly, Nick attempted to have a tryst with Laura's mother in the bathroom), and has been hired to off him for the preservation of reputation. The man pulls out a switchblade with a wicked grin, ready to slash — sensing danger on the premises, Laura belts out a screechy ""NOOOOOOOOO!""; Nick, in the meantime, overpowers the villain, slamming him against the handrail, the steps, the floor, until blood and brains cover the area. When his opponent is dead and gone, he can do nothing besides light a cigarette and viciously wag a finger at a Southern belle of a woman at the top of the stairs. You, his eyes say.No, we don't know what the hell is going on, and no, we aren't given enough time to react. Is this supposed to be a scene of camp, or a scene of heinous savagery? Perhaps both, as the carnage is soundtracked by thrash metal and Dern's screams while still managing to disturb the living bejesus out of us. As we will soon learn, Wild At Heart is a fearless road movie, unafraid to be abstract, unafraid to shock. Wild At Heart never gives us the chance to question our curiosity. It begins so ferociously that we're immediately determined to figure out why our supposed hero feels so inclined to crack a man's skull in full view, even if the answer is somewhat ambiguous. What follows is a sprawling tale of distinctive criminals and sordid romances, all set to the tune of the road, Elvis Presley, and The Wizard of Oz.Cage and Dern are Sailor and Lula, young lovers on the run from Sailor's parole and Lula's crazed mother, Marietta (Diane Ladd). The two merely want some time alone to bathe in each other's company through sex, rock 'n' roll, and the freedom of the highway; but Sailor, a cursed individual no doubt, has provoked the psychotic Marietta. He witnessed a scandalous event from her past that could ruin her high society livelihood, so, desperate, she hires a hit-man to rid herself, and her daughter, of any future harm. But this doesn't do as much good as she would like —in fact, it does the complete opposite. Unleashed is a nightmare of crooks that sets out to destroy Sailor and Lula's seemingly unbreakable love, while Marietta, in the meantime, suffers a breakdown in the face of wrenching guilt.Reading the synopsis I've just written, I'm worried that I've made Wild At Heart sound too much like '93's True Romance. That was a conventional movie with a vivid way with words, whereas Wild At Heart is a satire of the archetypes given to the lovers-on-the-run subgenre. To be even more specific, it is a satire of Sirkian melodramas, Elvis movies, road pictures, middle-of-nowhere noirs. It's one big satire, but it isn't. Lynch doesn't so much make fun of clichés as he does boil them in acid, turning them inside out and making things once viewed as beautiful oddly freakish. This is what I've always admired about his work; even at his worst moments, he creates his own world out of all things familiar.In some cases, his films have had too many ideas to fit into the space of a normal movie, playing out as monotonous rather than provocative. The framework of a road picture, however, suits Lynch's style perfectly. Road movies are places in which characters can ramble, where possibilities are endless; the unpredictability of his style is fitting, as tonal shifts manage to feel natural. The main characters are loose cannons, as are the individuals that haunt the small towns they face, so a jump from broad comedy to gory suspense doesn't feel very questionable. Sure, a genre shift can be jarring, but this is Lynch (or a Lynch road trip) we're talking about; a sense of aesthetic coherence is a gift from the gods. More sensational are the actors; the movie calls for insanity, and they provide nearly all of it. Cage and Dern are as over-the-top as any romantic leads could ever be, Cage taking breaks from metal concerts to lip-synch Elvis Presley's ""Love Me"", Dern going back and forth between vulnerable and thrill-seeking. Ladd, in a fantastic performance, is a hoot, taking the nastiest components of the bitchy women from Dynasty, Dallas, and Peyton Place and undergoing an excessive on screen breakdown. In one scene, she covers her face in red lipstick in the wake of an increasingly guilty conscience; it could have been laughable, but Ladd makes the ridiculousness masterful in its delivery.Wild At Heart has a wild heart no doubt, but it works much better than some of Lynch's more indulgent offerings. It's a reminder that filmmaking can be, in any form, an exciting craft.",Wild at Heart
86,gilligan1965,"A cross-country chase fueled by cigarettes, alcohol, rock music, lunatics, and...LOVE!",9,15 August 2015,"David Lynch has created and/or intensified some of movie's most extreme and psychopathic characters ever.Nicholas Cage's character, Sailor Ripley, is violent and always seems to find himself among the wrong crowd, except when it comes to the love of his life, Lula, whom he'd protect with his life. However, he's also someone who can be very nice and helpful so long as no one rubs him the wrong way.Sailor's girlfriend, Lula Fortune, played by Laura Dern, is a sweet, innocent, and, impressionable young lady; but, naive and sometimes as dumb as a box of rocks! Her love of Sailor is unquestionable!Together, these two run off on what becomes a road-trip/chase that leads to many encounters with David Lynch's other-than-wholesome cast of characters. Some weird; some strange; some funny; but, all are off-the-wall damaged!Bobby Peru, played by Willem Dafoe, is probably the best psychopathic and sociopathic maniac in any of David Lynch's movies (and/or, of all time)...to me. He's as crazed and violent as Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper) in ""Blue Velvet;"" but, unlike Booth, Bobby Peru can be friendly and persuasive with people (in order to use them), as well as funny...which, to me, makes him much more dangerous than Booth.Marietta Fortune, Lula's mother (Diane Ladd), is seemingly protective of her daughter; but, in actuality, is a demanding control-freak who cares of little beyond her own needs and wants.Marcelles Santos (J.E. Freeman) is a cold-blooded killer and complete lunatic - 100% worse than Frank Booth from ""Blue Velvet;"" and, without humor, like Bobby Peru.If you want to see a movie completely filled with unreasonable, shady, and, mentally-deranged, and, sometimes funny, characters...you have to see this. If you liked ""Blue Velvet,"" you'll love this case-study of some of the most pathologically messed-up characters all brought together in one movie. Even the 'cameo' characters seem as though they were temporarily released from an insane asylum just to shoot their scenes...it's brilliant! GREAT ACTING!*In Psychology 101 in college, we had to choose two books along with the movies, to write a psychiatric thesis on. Although neither were on the professor's list, with some persuasion, I was allowed to write about this book (and, movie...the movie is much more in-depth - thank you, David Lynch - I got an ""A"")!The other book/play (and, movie) was ""Equus"" (1977).This is a Bozo-Bin-Bonkers-Bonanza of a Bunch-a-Bananas...you'll love it! :)",Wild at Heart

After this he hooks up with his lover, Lula, who he fiercely protects, and goes on a bizarre road trip into the deep south of the states, while avoiding Lula's mother, played with passion by a deservedly Oscar-nominated Diane Ladd, who has an obsessive hatred for Sailor. They meet an assortment of weird people, especially Bobby Peru, and also Perdita Durango, who has appeared recently in a film with her name as the title, also written by Barry Gifford. It is classic David Lynch, with a homage type theme to the Wizard of Oz. It has the sensuality and eroticism later seen in Lost Highway, the violence and gore, the head sequence after the bank robbery being graphic, and a general uneasiness throughout.

The movie tells the story of two star crossed lovers that must go out on the road, so Lynch can use his lighting a match in the dark, headlights at night, and other lame trademarks. Typical Lynch, you keep wondering if there is a point out there, anywhere, but there is not. It is simply Lynch trying to make a cool movie.

This has everything I've come to expect from a David Lynch film....odd scenes, eerie background characters, fantastic Badelamenti soundtrack, great twisted atmosphere and amazing cinematography...The story is an amusing, a bare-bones parallel to the Wizard of Oz (and most of the references were amusing except for that horrid 'good witch' scene at the end...). And the story has good pacing, and great tone. Hell, even the plotless scenes were mostly excellent (some were the best of the film!) I especially liked the nightclub scene and the Big Tuna trailer park scene (Jack Nance was *awesome*!!)The cast were pretty much perfect...Nick Cage, who's so up and down that every second movie of his sucks, was perfect in this one. I just don't understand Cage, who's made so many good films and so many *awful* ones... He's done this role before (see Raising Arizona) and he always plays the redneck Elvis well...Laura Dern was alright...she shrieks *way* too much though, and it takes away from her otherwise solid performance. Diane Ladd was the *really* annoying one. I cringed every time she was on screen, which I suppose is the point (as the evil witch) but still, she was the one great flaw in this gem.Willem Dafoe was brilliant (those teeth frighten me...and they look so real too!) I've yet to see Willem Dafoe in a role I didn't appreciate, but he rocks here! (his death is classic as well.The gore was a bit over the top here, though. Lynch had obviously been watching too much Troma, as it was mostly cartoon and just silly. As were the excessive sex scenes (cartoon and silly, that is) but they didn't detract too much from the film, though he should stick to being odd and give up on the cheeze.The car crash scene was too much. I suppose it signaled the breakdown on the Yellow Brick Road, but it was frivolous and cheezy (and Sherilynn Fenn, who outside of Twin Peaks has always looked better than she acted, didn't help much). It could easily have been dropped without a blink, along with the later accident (oh look: more trivial gore...)The ending also needs work; cheezy and simpering, it fell flat from where it could have gone. As soon as he went to jail the second time the film just broke down and died. Of course it had to have a romantic happy ending, but Lynch seemed to run flat out of ideas...Overall: a good, solid Lynch film, fans will probably appreciate it even more. Odd and bizarre...typically Lynch (and actually quite tame compared to most of his films).

She doesn't want to see them together. Because of a murder, Sailor is finally released from prison. Lula's mom hires people to kill sailor. So Lula and Sailor go on a crazy road trip with dark and fellini like characters. William Defoe is unforgettable as the creepy and perverted Bobby Peru. The film almost received an X/NC-17 rating. It's easy to see why, it has lots of disturbing sex and violence. But than again that's a David Lynch trademark. This film is probably on my list of favorite road trip movies, next to Godard's ""Weekend"" (1967), ""Thelma & Louise"" and ""Natural Born Killers"". Both Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern give amazing performances. Dern's character Lula is the complete opposite of Sandy in ""Blue Velvet"", cause she's so wild and sexual. But Lula still has a naive child like charm. It seems that actor Nicholas Cage was born to play Sailor, a charming Elvis like ex convict who wants to change his ways.

91,jazzest,Over-The-Top Love Story by Lynch's Excellent Directing,7,15 September 2004,"With a simple road movie format rather than a complicated plot that he normally writes, David Lynch makes this over-the-top love story, almost exclusively relying on his excellent directing. Laura Dern, a second-timer for Lynch's films, is genuinely fitted into Lula, an impulsive and traumatized young woman, while Nicolas Cage convincingly performs Sailor, a young working-class man trapped in a twisted destiny. The two leads are undoubtedly the key factors for the film's achievement, but Lynch must be the one who elicits their superb performances. Side-characters, who commit perversive murders and sexual activities, are filled with Lynch's signature bizarreness in both appearances and personalities. Various kinds of music, from classical to Presley to heavy metal, collectively produce a timeless sense, another trademark of the director. A sort of happy ending is little compelling; this is one of the film's very few drawbacks but a big one, leaving the audience with a weakened final impression.",Wild at Heart
92,wandereramor,Nicholas Cage at his Nicholas Cagiest,7,19 April 2012,"This is probably Lynch's most openly comedic film, drawing on the uniquely kitschy aspects to American mythology to great effect. Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern ham it up as a pair of dimwitted lovers on the run, obsessed with such classic bits of Americana as Elvis and the Wizard of Oz. Lynch draws from the rich wells of melodrama to create a sublimely ridiculous story and a parody of the American road movie and its accompanying ideas of masculinity.With that said, this does feel like minor Lynch. The over-the-top aspects of Wild at Heart are hilarious at first, but over the course of two hours they wear out their welcome. Moreover, there's a line at which ironically being a bad movie stops justifying being a bad movie. I'm not sure that Wild at Heart crosses that line, but it still comes close to it.Wild at Heart may not be the masterpiece the Palme d'Or would make you think it is, but it's an enjoyable treat nonetheless, provided you don't mind a big helping of cheese.",Wild at Heart
93,pekinman,The Wizard of Weird,8,20 June 2008,"If any of David Lynch's films could be called ""sweet"" or ""heart-warming"" 'Wild at Heart' might be the one. It's bizarre and deeply disturbing which is part and parcel of watching a Lynch work, but it has an underlying fancifulness that kept me from turning away, except sometimes, from the Lynch's through-a-glass-darkly view of the world around us. There is only one character that gave me the absolute heebie-jeebies and that is Willem Dafoe's Bobby. Dafoe usually gives me the creeps anyway but here he plays an utterly dangerous and insane maniac at loose in the depths of the Texas desert. Isabella Rossellini's Dorothy Vallens from 'Blue Velvet' has relocated from South Carolina to Big Tuna, Texas and has not improved her lot in life. Her mother is played by the great actress Grace Zabriskie, they too offer a few moments of cringing repulsion, but all in all the story centers around the deep and abiding love of Sailor and Lula, Cage and Dern. Nicolas Cage gives a highly engaging performance of basically good soul trapped on a nasty path, he's also very sexy. I didn't think Laura Dern had such 'reach' in her acting abilities but she is tremendous in this role.I found myself sympathetic to their plight resulting from poor Sailor not having proper parental guidance as a child and Lula having one of those horrible vampire-mothers. Diane Ladd gives Marietta (mom) a jaw-dropping performance and rips the big screen away from everyone else when she appears. This is still a film that will make you squirm and probably shouldn't be watched too soon before going to bed, a rule of thumb for all Lynch movies, except Dune, which doesn't count. 'Wild at Heart' is not at all difficult to follow, unlike 'Lost Highway' and Mulholland Drive'. It has a clear-cut story with a sweet under-tone based on 'The Wizard of Oz'. It's a modern, sleazy version of 'Romeo and Juliet' the Lynch film that I have watched the most of them all, aside from 'Twin Peaks' to which I have become addicted.Recommended for those who have shied away from Lynch-World, but not for the kiddies.",Wild at Heart

95,kols,Lynch on steroids,1,5 May 2013,"Um - Wow! Nicholas Cage doing Elvis! Almost too hard to watch. Just the beginning.Lynch himself bouncing between Fellini and Hitchcock, hitting everyone in between. Playing Cage, Dern, Ladd, Dafoe, Rossellini, Stanton et al like mad marionettes. Using every weird European-inspired device, from extreme close-ups to putting the camera in front of lenses, like cocaine nightmares.This must have been a hell of a fun movie to make, giving in to every impulse from the actors mugging in every scene to Lynches' signature direction to the screenplay totally unbridled and special effects that include Dafoes' teeth and his glorious death-scene, blowing his head off with a good-ole-boy monster shotgun in a good-ole-boy Texas shoot-out.Great cars, too.Easy to see where all the raves come from, a Midnight movie from conceptional glint. I'm giving it one star in Homage to its intent, to be so bad as a movie that it transcends its media. In fact, from Blue Velvet to Twin Peaks to the disaster of Dune, Wild at Heart has got to be Lynches' masterpiece. Uncharacteristically, it even has a happy ending: Cage singing Love Me Tender in Elvis' voice to Dern after getting beaten up by a Chicano gang, being set straight by the Good Witch we all remember from Oz, and realizing she (Dern/Lulu) is the love of his life. Everything just totally off the wall.Even better, Lynch is being so much Lynch that Lynch disappears and the movie splats on the screen as itself, transcending Lynch, the over-acting, the screenplay, the truly awful, European devices as well as its media. Textbook really bad movie with absolutely nothing going for it proving that that's what movies are all about.One caveat - you got to be able to stomach Cage not only trying to act but trying to be Elvis while he's trying to act. It's a very painful experience, like watching French-people trying to act and speak French at the same time or Gerald Ford trying to think and chew gum simultaneously. But if you can get through it, you'll be rewarded.Down to it, Wild at Heart's just a good-ole, traditional love story filled with good-ole, traditional love story angst and pathos and a good-ole, traditional love-story ending.",Wild at Heart

Then, he puts his finger toward Lula's mother, the ""wicked witch"". The rest fallows the same old and fast road : bank robbery, running away, road, movie, fire, perversions, dreams, fear, until Willem Defoe arrives, masked with a ghost's face, shooting everything that moves, before he blows himself away. That's the way it works with Booby Perou.Everything goes as fast as a Punk-Rock song, but at the end of the ""yellow brick road"", it's finally ""Love me tender"" that Sailor choose to sing to Lula.Nothing else to say, for this movie is a movie of few words, just sounds and images : so I'll just shut up and watch again this beautiful losers disappear in their own beautiful madness.",Wild at Heart

The story is magnificent as is the direction and acting; a surrealists' films always give the actor's such a natural tone. In this film, you'll find craziness, violence, sorrow, separation, Isabella Rosselini in a wig, Laura Dern's breasts, and a 'good' witch. A satirical post-modernised version of ""The Wizard of Oz,"" make sure when you watch this wearing clean underwear.",Wild at Heart
98,robertmaybeth,"Poignant, tragic, dramatic and funny - Lynch manages to push every emotion with this sensitive film",9,20 April 2018,"I admit to being as infatuated with this film as I am slightly repelled by it. I watch ""Wild"" every time it comes on and I'm not really sure why - especially since the emotions this film stirs up in me are not always pleasant. There is much to love about this film and much to dislike. The love in this film (between Lula and Sailor) is very pure and strong; but so is the hatred and violence. the feelings called up in the story are not always pretty,; in fact much of it is quite ugly and hard to watch. Even worse, the moment we identify with Sailor and Lula we are forced to realize we have no way of knowing what will happen next, except it probably won't be good for anybody - since they are simply swept along by events. Sailor and Lula are so innocent and even naiive' at times, we identify so strongly with them that they quickly become ""ours"" somehow. it's obvious the emotions we feel are deliberately (and precisely) orchestrated by Lynch's masterful direction, and it's hard not to feel resentment at times. The fun couple tries very hard to run from their problems (Lula's insane mother, who will do literally anything to break them up) but never seem to get anywhere, since it always finds them. In a sort of non-stop symphony of emotions we allow ourselves to be carried along with Sailor and Lula's train-wreck-in-progress... we want to see the characters to the end, good or bad. Romantic love, sex, innocence, evil, jealousy, obsession - Sailor and Lula, (and we the audience) confront them all; and when their love story suddenly begins to turn to something darker, we feel it as acutely as they do. Lynch deliberately set out to create the emotional roller-coaster in the audience and he succeeds; but the execution is so masterful it almost becomes another character all it's own.This is the kind of film you will either like very much or hate - there are many elements of absurdity that barely fit the narrative, and the senselessness of some of the scenes and characters can be hard to overlook - but ""wild"" is an unconventional romance/drama/comedy that never seems to take itself too seriously yet delivers many powerful messages that you might find thinking about long after you've finished watching.",Wild at Heart

100,Naoufel_B,"Not Lynch's masterpiece, but still a very unique experience.",8,27 April 2021,"Lynch gave us his take on ""The Wizard of Oz"" with this film.Violent, raw, erotic and emotional, David Lynch combined all these elements to craft one of his most romantic works, a twisted wild ride that is Wild at Heart. A film about a couple trying to hide away from the madness and absurdity of the world, it explores the life and struggle of two characters came from dysfunctional families, one who has an evil controlling mother figure, the other who's never had any ""parental guidance"", filled with some surrealistic and weird lynchian moments. For the technical part, Wild at Heart has an amazing soundtrack, an impressive mise en scène and a stunning camera work all covered by a tasty color palette that fits perfectly with the themes of this film. And for the last, you couldn't help but admire the great performances produced by the great talent of actors of this film.",Wild at Heart
101,dissident320,Great to look at but not much story,6,2 September 2017,"I found this to not much more than pieces of movie. I enjoyed most of the scenes but never felt immersed in the story. Lynch always fills his shows and movies with interesting actors and this is no exception. Multiple people steal scenes and are never seen in the movie again. I did enjoy the parallel stories with real-life mother and daughter Diane Ladd and Laura Dern. They both give exceptional performances and Dern is captivating throughout. Nic Cage gives one of his more restrained performances and is fine but didn't impress me like Leaving Las Vegas.It's a decent movie, but it feels as if Lynch didn't want to make it too weird or too conventional. So it sits in the middle and isn't that exciting or interesting. Watch it for the performances and hopefully the story won't disappoint as much.",Wild at Heart
102,suzy q123,Not one of his best.,1,18 June 2001,"I much prefer Blue Velvet, maybe because it was new and shocking and original, whereas here Lynch seems to be copying himself, Nic Cage seems to be doing his faux-Elvis 'look at me all the time"" schtick and Laura Dern just seems lost. The camera work is lovely, but to what end? It's kind of an empty story when all is said and done. As Emanuel Levy says in his book Cinema of Outsiders, ""the shocks have little resonance, and the weirdness is trivial- the pictures hyperkinetic wildness is mostly on the surface, the images are elaborately conceived but meaningless.""",Wild at Heart

105,nickrogers1969,bleak,3,1 February 2009,"This was the most hyped film of 1990. It was considered one of the coolest films of the 90's. I saw it once when it came out and the only things I remembered was the car accident with Sherilyn Fenn and the angel at the end. That's it. I saw it again for the first time in 19 years and I understand why. It's not very memorable because it isn't a very good movie. Sure, there are some cool crazy characters (all right, they're all crazy!) and the photography of the bleak landscape is beautiful. David Lynch has also a cool way of using sounds and music which makes the film very eerie. Apart from that, the film is dangerously close to being a B-movie, almost laughable. It doesn't hold up.",Wild at Heart
106,Lt_Coffey_182,Classic Lynch,7,26 December 2005,"Wild at Heart is one of David Lynch's most conventional stories, which says something about Lynch as this film is very bizarre and full of surreal elements. Inspired by the Wizard of Oz, Wild at Heart is certainly a road movie with a difference. The strongest weapon in Wild at Heart's impressive arsenal is contrast. The stark contrast of the romance between the two main characters and the graphic violence and disturbing images puts this film at both ends of the film spectrum. Disturbing and twisted imagery is, of course, Lynch's forte so it is no big surprise that Wild at Heart is as dark as they come.No David Lynch film is complete without a collection of weird and wacky characters. There aren't many people better than Nicolas Cage at fronting a group of weirdoes and to this day, Wild at Heart remains one of Cage's best performances. Cage as Sailor is unhinged in this film. Armed with a snakeskin coat and wild eyes, Cage is very memorable. Laura Dern is brilliant at playing the hopeless romantic Lula and developed wonderfully from her performance in Blue Velvet. Dern is very sexy in her part and her and Cage are a terrific pairing. Dianne Ladd and Willem Dafoe provide excellent support. Ladd probably gives the best performance (was Oscar nominated) as the psychotic, over protective mother. Her facial movements are almost terrifying, she is that good. Dafoe is utterly revolting in this film, his sleazy demeanour is great to see. Twin Peaks and John Carpenter's Vampires star, Sheryl Lee also makes a nice cameo as The Good Witch.Like me, Lynch loves his heavy rock music so I really enjoyed the soundtrack to this film. The crunching guitar riffs during the animalistic sex scenes are very effective as they emphasise the nature of what is occurring visually. Contrast is also a feature in the music because whilst there is all this heavy music in the background, out will pop Cage performing an Elvis number. Very bizarre but very good.Wild at Heart is like watching Blue Velvet mixed with Wizard of Oz and it's fascinating. Lynch once again, gives the world a film to remember. A film that encourages us to use our imagination and expands our outlook on films. Wild at Heart casts a spell on anyone who dares to watch.",Wild at Heart
107,CooperCom,Very bad,1,21 December 1999,"Wild at heart is in my opinion one of the worst films ever made. The director tries really hard to make a film that is unlike most of the other films. (And that is almost all he manages). OK, this is not a mainstream film from the Hollywood-factory, but what is the point of making a film that is so repulsing and dull. Lynch tries once again to fool some of the audience to think that movies which are different from mainstream-films are good movies, but that's not true in this case.",Wild at Heart
108,diztorted,The Wild Cinema of David Lynch,10,30 April 2001,"Is there other way to put it? Wild at heart is by far one of the most spectacular films ever. A film that is wild hearted itself and stands as a unique road film like no other. There so many unforgettable things of this film, that once you've seen it, your mind gets invaded by it.Again, Lynch manages to not only make a strange film but to create a whole new world, a world in which Saylor Ripley is the only good person surrounded by the bad element of the world trying to keep him apart from his love Lula. Every character of this film manage a duality, an internal struggle between good and evil, between obedience and rebellion. And the result is a film that stands to a world that is just like Bobby Peru's teeth, rotten and part of a cynical smile that is mocking at you all the time.Everything in this films is taken to the limits, giving thus the wild element of the film like the glaze of Saylor to Marietta. It goes from extreme love to extreme hate; from extreme adventure to extreme desperation, and even extreme ambition. And at the end, you will see which of all these feelings is stronger than all.From the minute I'd set eyes on this film, I couldn't get away from it, and now is one of my all time favorite films.

111,ElWormo,mind blowing,10,26 July 2015,"Wild At Heart is one of those films that scoops you up and plants you directly in its own magical, twisted little world as soon as it starts and drops you back on boring old planet earth at the end feeling like you've just woken from a dream. At least that's the effect it had on me the first few times I saw it, and seeing it again last night for the first time in years the same is true, in fact it's possibly even better than I remembered. I can't be bothered to go into plot and character details, suffice to say that everyone involved gives top notch performances, and the story is deep enough to be engaging without being confusing. Sometimes funny, sometimes sad, occasionally terrifying, but always deliciously deranged, Wild At Heart is quite possibly one of the ten greatest pieces of cinema ever created in my opinion. I'm not even a massive David Lynch fan - in fact this is the only Lynch movie I've felt the need to watch more than once - however this one is a sublime, darkside masterpiece that blows away the competition.

I really don't see the need for sex scenes in this movie, although in my favorite lynch movie 'Lost Highway' i thought the sex scenes were quite appropriate. Warning! This movie goes from sick, to sicker, to downright disturbing and is not for the faint hearted with graphic violence aplenty. It's interesting film, but it's just so typically lynch. I am becoming a tad bit sick of the randomness of his narratives. Not being one of lynch's best movies, it still is riotously entertaining romp. The performances of Cage and Dern are fantastic, and the film has a brilliant and Moving finale. What the film has to do with the Wizard of OZ, well don't ask me, Just sit back, watch, and soak in some of that pure lynch madness.Recommendation: Bring weed!",Wild at Heart

While those uncanny events and characters don't quite fit with the movie's atmosphere, they're still individually enjoyable; it's just what Lynch said: it's more like a compilation of random events and moments within the movie's context. Also, you cannot get wrong with Nicolas Cage's over-the-top yet natural acting, energetic and charismatic Laura Dern and the creepily funny Willem Dafoe's character.
This is more like a transition between the somehow more accessible previous movies (except ""Eraserhead"" of course) and the brain madness that's about to come.",Wild at Heart
115,Tulsa90,Uneven and Very Overrated,5,3 January 2005,"I really liked Blue velvet and Mulholland Drive and other David Lynch films. However, Wild at Heart is one of Lynch's weaker efforts. I just don't think any of the characters are believable and at no point in the film did I care what happened to any of them. Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern are both talented actors, but they don't have a lot to work with here. A lot of the scenes and dialog seems contrived and unreal and just plain odd. All in all not a very good film. By the time the last half hour rolled around I was hoping that some Aliens would suddenly appear from out of nowhere and annihilate the entire cast and crew. Don't waste your time on this one unless you're doing a 30-year stretch in Folsom Prison and this is the only flick they have available to rent.",Wild at Heart
116,emdragon,Don't turn away from love Sailor,10,13 March 2008,"In what I personally consider to be a great masterpiece of shock-like dream-work film-making, Wild At Heart explodes onto the screen in a surreal swirl of intense absurdity. Yet the plot and characters follow a true love story through a wonderfully shocking realism that literally digs into the viewers soul and draws him/her in. I truly loved this picture above all others. When Nicholas Cage (Sailor) sings ""Love Me Tender"" to Laura Dern (Lulu) at the end of the picture I find myself bubbling, burbling and sheathed in a great and glowing light of rapturous wonder. David Lynch has come to an epiphany of self creativity with this picture, and yet one has to be a little ""wild at heart, and weird on top"" perhaps to truly appreciate this film's luster. Strange and absurd characters abound throughout, and every scene is significantly twisted into it's own fabric of intensity and sexual energy. With a grand diversity of musical rifts, this movie rocks. The Wizard of Oz, and Elvis Presley are metaphors that keep cropping up in this film. Diane Ladd, who plays Lulu's mother, Marietta, carries much of the emotional and surrealistic tone with her maniacal portrayal of motherly jealousy and hatred toward her daughter's chance at the one true love she could never find. Harry Dean Stanton, Willem Dafoe, Isabella Rossallini, Grace Zabriske, Sheryl Lee (as the good witch), and the entire rest of the cast all shine in this tale, a lattice work of consistent intensity and aesthetic unveilings where two lovers try to find whatever happiness they can ""down that old yellow brick road"". As Sailor and Lulu desperately try to escape their twisted pasts, a string of relevant adventures follows them as they try to run from the evil characters who have corrupted their lives back home. Driving their way toward California via New Orleans and Texas they run out of money in the town of Big Tuna, Texas. Throughout this ordeal, they are chased by forces wickedly employed by Lulu's mother and her evil associates. Sailor is finally forced into the choice of committing a crime against his better judgement, and it turns out badly. But after this violently troubling episode there is a happy and wonderful ending. It is still weird and wild (of course) when Sailor finally gets to meet his son Pace after a 6 year stint in prison (which takes about 3 minutes in movie time). In one of my favorite scenes near the end of the picture, Sailor suddenly decides he can never fit in and care for his family like he should after he is just released from prison, so decides to leave temporarily, but not before giving his little son Pace (whom he has just met) this advise. ""If ever things don't seem right to you. . .remember what Poncho said to the Cisco kid. 'Let's win before we're dancin at the end of a rope' "". Then he walks off; intent on leaving before more wonderfully absurd circumstances bring him out of his delerium and back to his true love, Lulu and Pace. It is somehow weirdly and consistently funny and wonderfully fun to watch. Anyway, I truly loved it.",Wild at Heart
117,KnightLander,"Far from Lynch's best, but very enjoyable",7,21 June 2005,"Shortly after beginning work on the TV show ""Twin Peaks"", David Lynch made ""Wild at Heart"", an adaptation of Barry Gifford's novel. Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern play Sailor and Lula, two lovers who are driving cross-country to escape from Lula's mother, Marietta (played by Diane Ladd, Dern's real-life mother). Marietta goes insane at the thought of any boys going near her daughter, but Sailor Ripley especially, because she suspects that he saw her murder her husband years ago.Marietta has half the country out looking for Sailor and Lula, including the murderer duo of Reggie (Calvin Lockhart) and Juana (Grace Zabriskie); the bizarre hit-man Bobby Peru (Willem Dafoe), and his partner, the beautiful Perdita Durango (Isabella Rossellini); and Marietta's ex-lover, the murderous Santos (J.E. Freeman). The only sane person searching for the lovers is Johnnie Farragut (Harry Dean Stanton), a level-headed man completely dedicated to Marietta.David Lynch is famous for his weird movies, which are often incomprehensible during the first viewing. ""Wild at Heart"" is considerably less weird than Lynch's other movies, but that doesn't mean it isn't weirder than most movies. It also happens to be funny in many scenes. Of course, it can also be disturbing; there are many scenes of violence.The cast is great. Cage is very funny with his Elvis-style accent. Dafoe is great. Harry Dean Stanton is very fine and quite likable as Johnnie Farragut. Diane Ladd is wonderful as Lula's mother.Interestingly, there are numerous references to ""The Wizard of Oz"" in here; what made Lynch think of Oz is anyone's guess. ""Twin Peaks"" fans will notice many cast members from the show, including Zabriskie, Sherilyn Fenn, and Sheryl Lee.The film features a very good soundtrack, a combination of country, Angelo Badalamenti's easygoing score and the occasional heavy metal.All in all, I think ""Wild at Heart"" is an underrated movie that, while far from Lynch's best, is very enjoyable. It is well-filmed and -directed, and there is a feeling of strength and energy that makes the film even more appealing. Not everyone will enjoy the movie, but I sure as hell did.",Wild at Heart
118,rdolan9007,Atypically ambitious but flawed film from David Lynch,7,2 April 2012,"On the surface this may seem typical Lynch fare, the mixing of film genre, strange often unexplained characters, and a strong visual style. Unlike most Lynch films however the story is actually a simple one, the two main characters that of Nick Cage and Laura Dern play two lovers being hunted down by hired killers. They have been hired by Laura Dern's vengeful and deranged mother. The film therefore appears to be a readily recognizable form that of the chase movie, however Lynch likes to complicate, perhaps over complicate, and this makes in this case for a messy and uneven film. Some might argue this is the effect he is going for, but to me it is Lynch not handling the material effectively. He prefers to go for weirdness as a stylistic effect, rather than to explain or further the plot. I also think that Laura Dern doesn't quite have that compelling glamour that the film needs to really justify the more over the top aspects. It tries to involve wizard of Oz references, which only distract from rather than help the story. There are attempts to bring musical elements to the story, but this film is a tough one and the attempts at lyricism seem out of place. Cages performance is actually very good and most of the time he underplays rather than hams it up, which works in a wildly ambitious film like this. I wish I liked this film more, and I can see that for the early 90's this might have been seen as a landmark film, it's strong sexual references intermixed with violence, and directorial flourishes would have seemed exciting. Today the film it seems a little dated, and a little self indulgent. There are fine scenes in this film however to make this film worth watching. The scene of the girl dying after the car accident, is astonishingly powerful, and genuinely moving. There is also a very nicely done gory touch at the end of the film. I just wish there were more scenes like that to make the film something better than the sum of its rather disjointed parts.",Wild at Heart

I think most of the brilliance was due to unique directing and a dynamic cast, in particular, Dennis Hopper. I thought that ""Blue Velvet"" heralded the arrival of a great new director. The problem is, I have not liked anything else Lynch has done since. Movies to him have become an opportunity to string together a few cosmic and stylistic scenes. The negative is, you generally have to tread through many more pointless scenes that do not illuminate the ""story"" at all. A car's headlights on a road, eccentric and bizarre characters, stylish music, filler. The same blueprint for every movie. His movies are stylistic filler, no message, no point, but many scenes that are cool to look at. We then automatically think there is some great and surreal purpose to these imaginative scenes, but there isn't. There is surreal and then there is a stylish waste of time. Lynch creates a stylish waste of time, unless the eye candy is enough.",Wild at Heart

121,knight110tim,Hotter than Georgia asphalt!,10,12 December 2005,"In a cruel, creepy, crumbling world, the romance of Sailor and Lula at the core of Wild At Heart is the bright sun that a galaxy of eccentric characters revolve around in David Lynch's signature film. Bizarre, absurd, surreal and extremely violent, the film weaves a canvas of classic love story, Wizard of Oz and Natural Born Killers (another great messed-up romance) that will stick in your mind forever - with its extreme characters, brain scrambling soundtrack and memorable images.From its shocking opening to its beautiful Elvis-fuelled climax, Wild at Heart never puts a foot wrong. Outside of Twin Peaks and Frank from Blue Velvet, Lynch has yet to create a more wonderful, rounded, set of characters that will get under your skin and stay with you like a nightmare tattoo. It's impossible to imagine anyone other than Nicolas Cage as Sailor Ripley, the coolest - if not smartest - man on Earth or Willem Dafoe as his nemesis, the dark angel of death Bobby Peru.For an archetypal Lynch film, the plot of Wild at Heart, inspired by Barry Gifford's great book, is quite straight forward and very romantic, which makes it more accessible to the general public - well, those with strong stomachs - who want to cruise along this particular highway and taste life on the 'wild' side!",Wild at Heart
122,tangietangerine,This whole world is wild at heart and weird on top,8,4 August 2014,"This movie is another fine voyage into David Lynch's fantastic world. Although it's not one of my favorites, I can enjoy some of the same unmistakable aspects present in other of his films; a rupture from reality, constantly giving place to oneiric experiences, where the strangeness and the humor that comes with it hit us full force. Scenes like Sailor and Lula dancing at the nightclub, where Sailor suddenly stops the party to ""prove his love to his girl"" and then finishes off with a powerful song by ""E"", are simply hilarious. Also, quotes like ""this is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it's a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom"" set the tone to the movie. Besides the comedic side, there's also an interesting take at the love story between Sail' and Lula, involving Lula's growing up and having to overcome her childish anxieties, such as the maternal power, which to me, is what the story is really about. The constant parallel made between their story and Wizard of Oz's proves that point, in which Lula's mother would take the place of the Wicked Witch of the West. We follow Laura's character as she slowly escapes from her mother's control to experience her womanhood and become rather independent, but there always seems to be something evil on the verge of happening, to prevent Lula from experiencing a full grown-up life beside Sail', like there was always something preventing Dorothy from getting back to Kansas. I think both Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern's performances were great, and also bold, for that matter. One little thing I noticed after repeated viewings is the way Laura smokes her cigarettes. I'm not sure if it was intentional or something personal (I suppose the latter), but if you pay enough attention (and they are ALWAYS smoking), you can see she never takes a full drag or inhales the smoke, only sort of pretends to do so. Details like this are fun to notice after you've watched a movie quite a few times, and when it's a Lynch film, there are always hidden treasures.",Wild at Heart

Lynch usually never let's me down in this sense. Therefor I couldn't wait to watch Wild At Heart. However, don't let Lynch's name attached to this film fool you. It just honestly isn't that good. I hate to say it but I was really let down by this piece of Lynch's work. Most of all the story was just weak it never grips you, you are never excited about what's happening and what's going to happen next. The symbolism shots and Wizard of Oz references just were not genius...they seemed weak, almost pointless and most of all cheesy. The movie also has a very dated feel to it, it didn't hold up well. This movie is 4 years newer than BLUE VELVET but seems so much older. I gave this movie 4/10 stars...those points are only for the fact the movie at least is different than most movies & for WILLEM DAFOE's character and scenes.

125,ruthierocks,A symbol of Lynch's individuality and personal freedom.,8,13 November 2008,"Wild at Heart is probably the most conventional David Lynch film I've seen. That being said, it still remains very far from mainstream. Wild at Heart revolved around a young couple, played to perfection by Nicolas Cage and Laura Dern. Fast paced, mostly ridiculous, and pretty unrealistic, Wild at Heart is far from perfect, but a very fun film to watch.The premise is strange, but intriguing. A young couple is separated when the guy, an Elvis fanatic named Sailor (Nicolas Cage), goes to prison for manslaughter after defending himself against a man who threatened him. When he gets out, he is desperate to get Lula (Laura Dern), the girl he loves, back again. Lula is more than willing to pick up the relationship, but if her mother has anything to do with it, she won't have a chance. Being young and in love, the girl rebels. However, her mother's desperation leads her to contact a hit-man she is in knows and the young couple is forced to run away. The two lovebirds head to California and encounter all sorts of crazy situations along the way.Arguably the best thing about Wild at Heart is its great cast. Nicolas Cage is in his prime here and the role is, somewhat, reminiscent of the ""repeat offender"" he played in Raising Arizona. Nicolas Cage was great in his pre-action-hero movies. Laura Dern is equally excellent. I'd never understood the reason for her popularity in sexy roles. It's effective here, though, and she embodies sweet yet trashy Lula wonderfully. Supporting performances by Willem Defoe, Harry Dean Stanton, and Diane Ladd also provide liveliness that enhances the film.Although it deals with such serious subjects as murder, incest, and general family dysfunction, Wild at Heart is anything but serious. The film is chocked full of amusing moments and over the top clichés. The best example of this is the presence of a rich, older crime boss with a penchant for having young  preferably naked  young girls surrounding him at all times he's present. There are a few moments when the style gets repetitive and the characters do something worthy of much eye-rolling. Despite that, this movie is never boring and fairly unpredictable.Wild at Heart is a fun adventure to hitch a ride on. It is full of energy and snappy dialogue. Unlike most Lynch films, it is very linear and straight forward. The acting is excellent and the characters are strangely likable. Wild at Heart feels a little long and drags in a few places toward the end, but this barely hinders the film in its entirety. This is an amusing film, one that would make a good introduction to Lynch for those unfamiliar. For the rest of us, it's simply an enjoyable piece of film-making.8/10",Wild at Heart
126,Smerdyakoff,"Pretentious, Ridiculous but a template for even worse movies",3,15 May 2016,"First off, Cage and Dern did a great job keeping this sleazy pile going on. But their performances, however good, couldn't rectify what was essentially an evil exploitative movie. First off, I don't care about symbolism for its own sake, especially when symbolism is used to elevate trash intellectually. Pop culture references are a total bore and cop out, yeah yeah, Elvis & the Wizard of Oz, too heavy! But to the movie's credit, it CREATED the themes and styles that permeated the 90s and the early 2000s that I hated. Weird characters for weirdness sake Lots of fire & red Patronizing Southern and Western themes used to mock said cultures Stylized violence and villainy Elvis, omg, can you get any more tacky? Tacky retro styles like old T-Birds, snake skin jackets, ballroom settings for what? Road movies through the same South and West derided earlier Road movies of young lovers who aren't as wicked as the scum who are chasing them. The young lovers are actually almost noble. Lots of steaming hot sex with beautiful people. Also too much cigarette smoking, like some high school rebellion thing from the 1950s. Is that supposed to be risqué? I hate cigs! Relentlessly exploiting disabled, disfigured, mentally ill characters just to keep it all so weird. Don't get me wrong, handicapped people don't have to be glorified or honored all the time, but in here they were just there for atmosphere The relentless mockery and denigration of the family. The movies that use some of these elements are legion but two movies use this as a template, ""True Romance"" and ""Natural Born Killers"". But 1000s of cheaper indies like ""Way of the Gun"", or ""Arizona Dream"" borrow the style elements almost verbatim. Tarantino's cynically used these elements in his movies too, but of course, he added his own distinctive touches.So in that respect, we can give this movie plaudits, like the original Road Warrior, in creating a whole genre, a dubious one.",Wild at Heart
127,Phrankster163,Excellent Lynch movie,9,28 March 2005,"Two breakout performances (Cage and Dern), fantastic imagery and the most wonderfully twisted characters are what makes this movie a true standout. I just saw it again yesterday after not having seen it since it was out on video some 15 years ago, and all i really remembered was a truly creepy Willem Dafoe and Cage singing Love me Tender to Dern on top of their car at the end. Needless to say, it is so much more than that. It is a love story on acid, and a great one at that. You might say that it's David Lynch's attempt at writing the greatest love story ever, and it certainly has it all. Plus, it was fun to see some of the later Twin Peaks cast members in their various cameos (also it's evident that at least part of the ""Twin Peaks style"", with almost hypnotizing music to fit these extremely weird characters is something that Lynch started with in this one.)",Wild at Heart

This movie have some references to ""Oz"" that is quite unconventional. If you haven't seen it some scenes in ""Wild"" just become very strange.Ok, the movie is strange and weird like most of David Lynch's work, but personally this is my Lynch-favorite. It's raw but beautiful. Cage and Dern make sense together, and in the end the whole movie actually makes sense to. Finally there is the excellent acting by Dafoe and Stanton which add up to two hours of postmodern excellence.",Wild at Heart
129,john-mitchell77,Lynch Does Lynch,6,12 December 2011,"Now, I am a Lynch fan. I love the way he is able to tap into the most disturbing recesses of the subconscious, dredge up the most visceral, unnerving and insane thoughts, ideas and images, which reside there, and transfer them onto the screen. This was done superbly in Eraserhead and the pilot of Twin Peaks. It pains me to say, then, that this does not come up to par. It's almost like he is running a 'how to be a Lychian director' class, and has made this as an educational tool. It's like 'Lynch does Lynch'; he has become conscious of what we expect, and has tried too hard. Consequently, it comes off like a parody, and performances from certain people - most notably, Nicolas Cage - do not help. I get the feeling he is going for a James Dean in Rebel Without A Cause kind of vibe, but unfortunately, does a kind of disaffected Elvis. There are some flashes of the old master, but mostly this is a disappointing offering from someone so original.",Wild at Heart
130,Myshkin_Karamazov,Wildness -- One Ring To Rule Them All,7,22 July 2005,"""Wild At Heart"" remains true to its name. All the characters are driven by wildness. Wildness is the fine thread that runs through the course of the movie, binds the characters together, lurks behind the scenes, and tightens round events. Wildness is the one ring that rules them all.While sometimes free to reveal this wildness and at other times conceal it, characters appear frequently on the edge. Although most performances are good or at least satisfactory, they still run the risk of being over-the-top.There happen to be quiet a few villains in this film. But none of them reaches any way near Dennis Hopper's Frank Booth in Lynch's masterpiece ""Blue Velvet"". Booth's dominance, his nasty presence could be felt anywhere and everywhere in the picture. He alone can be compared with legendary modern villains like Anothany Hopkins' Dr. Hannibal Lecter in Silence Of The Lambs"".There are just so many references to ""The Wizard Of Oz"", one may even consider this film to be a bizarre post-modern ""remake"" of the original musical classic. Very much in David Lynch's line. In his own creative fashion, he successfully employs the well-known allegory about Emerlad City to make his point. Brilliant.Whether silhouetted against the void of the day or luminous opposite the dark of the night, the Wicked Witch evokes not only terror, but also understanding of the characters' situation.Lynch has the good sense not to use Oz as a subplot however. It sort of hovers above the main feature like a ""superplot"". In the sense that it not only helps unfold the story so far, but also provides room for some wild guess at the direction it may take on the yellow brick road.The only unconvincing import from the merry old land of Oz was the good witch. But then, I was never much impressed by the original one in the first place. She was, I used to tell myself, a necessary evil, like so many things in our real world. So unlike Oz.",Wild at Heart

134,Vancity_Film_Fanatic,Mesmerizing.,10,1 March 2005,"Recipient of the prestigious Palme d'Or award at Cannes, David Lynch's ""Wild at Heart"" is an amazingly brilliant spectacle for the senses. Bold splashes of deep red, curiously staged musical numbers (Nicolas Cage does his own singing  and he's great!), and the continuous references to ""The Wizard of Oz"" help create a surreal and dreamlike texture to the narrative. The story in brief: Sailor and Lula (excellent performances from both Nicolas Cage & Laura Dern); two broken souls passionately in love, flee the vengeful wrath of Lula's mother Marietta, who for reasons of her own will stop at nothing to ensure the lovers are kept apart. Diane Ladd practically steals the show in her brave portrayal of Lula's psychopathic mother Marietta. Gut wrenchingly violent in places, hopelessly romantic in others; Lynch has crafted an adult fairy tale worthy of multiple viewings. Recommended to those who enjoy and appreciate abstract methods of film-making  a definite 10/10!",Wild at Heart

It shows a story in an unconventional way, with Shakespearean elements, strange characters, Elvis references, romance, disturbing images and much more, all rolled into a fairly decent film.Despite its unusual nature and its originality, I was not really moved or blown away by this movie. The colors, music and words do create a certain mood, but I found it lacked the quality to really draw me in. It's not really as thought-provoking, intense or funny as it aims to be. It is hard to name specific things, but the movie as a whole left me quite unaffected. On a brighter note, the acting is adequate and some of characters are brilliant.All in all, Wild at Heart is a decently interesting but instantly forgettable film. An attempt at crafting a universal and abstract portrayal of human beings, which, to me, falls short.",Wild at Heart

Sort of from the times before movies reached a certain quality - as if it's attraction enough that it IS a movie.I like quirky movies, I like dark movies, I like layered movies, even the odd ""artsy"" movie. This was none of that, in spite of being touted by many to be so. I found it tedious, unfunny and shallow. It could've had some B-movie'ish charm if just about everything in it was of a less pretentious ""let's be quirky cool"" - but, alas it wasn't.I'm trying to think of some positives, but I'm coming up empty. It's not even a ""style over substance"" candidate, as both aspects are equally dreary.

140,Immy,David Lynch's last hurrah?,9,15 October 1998,"Ah, I remember fondly the days when searching for the quirky and bizarre in film  meant looking no further than the latest David Lynch offering. 'Wild at Heart' represents the last time he got it right.Brimming with offbeat characters and attitude to spare, come along on Nick Cage and Laura Dern's redneck odyssey on the lam.

The whole Elvis imitation thing and the overblown drama of the relationship are camp humour.  The Wizard of Oz links are also pretty funny.  However, there are some heavy-handed attempts to create intensity, some of which fall flat and some of which work, and subplots that never get developed or seem to go anywhere.  A pared-down version of this movie could have been brilliant as a dark comedy/drama.  I can't help thinking that Lynch was throwing too many ideas around and didn't pull it together.  It's also obvious he was working on Twin Peaks at the same time as they have a similar feel at points and some of the same devices are used in both.I'd give it 6.5 (if I could), but gave it 6 since it's a little painful at points.",Wild at Heart
142,mysteriouselkdog,"Wizard of Oz, Elvis Singing, ""weird on top"" why???",6,23 May 2005,"This movie was a mess. It had some good aspects, but for the most part it was just kind of stupid. I didn't like the wizard of oz parts in the movie, they seemed totally out of place. The worst wizard of oz tie in was when Nick Cage gets beat up at the end (totally random) and the good witch starts talking to him up in the sky. The girls mother was totally psycho, made me uncomfortable when she was in scenes because she screams a lot and makes you cringe. This movie is almost comedic in how dumb parts are. Like when Nick Cage is in that club jumping around kicking the air and going crazy, it made me laugh and reminded me of the scene in Ace Ventura. Probably my least favorite aspect of this movie is when Nick Cage starts singing for no reason. At the end I think he sings an Elvis song or something, it's so dumb it makes me irritated to watch it. Oh yeah this movie has one of the worst lines ever, ""This whole world's wild at heart and weird on top."" I really wish they would have left that line out of the movie like David Lynch originally did (I watched the extras and found out the author asked him to put it in). Probably my favorite aspect of the movie was Willem Dafoe and the Duck sounding guy. Willem Dafoe plays a creep so well in this movie. I love the bank robbery part of the movie it was great. I might have given this movie a 7 if not for the Elvis singing and good witch at the end.",Wild at Heart
143,Napoleonforever,David Lynch can tell a story and takes chances - HIS way!,10,11 July 2006,"Mr. Lynch is genuine and this is evident by the strange, unorthodox movies he makes. Strong characterizations, vivid imagery makes his films unforgettable. Let's face it - it is the unforgettable ones have a most profound effect on the audiences, thus this filmmaker has done the job - told the story in a way that you are going to remember - for a long, long time! Yes Mr. Lynch has some audience members that do not like his films. Those who don't give Mr. Lynch a fair shake can go back to their secure, Hollywood cookie-cutter cinematic jokes-for-products, and that way they will remain happy in their own world. Mr. Lynch's world, as we can see in this movie Wild at Heart, is much more complex and emphasizes on the bizarre, macabre, and almost the unthinkable. Mr. Lynch takes chances in this Industry, and chance-takers are not really made to be felt welcome; too much controversy scares the Majors into thinking that future ticket sales will slump. Be they right or not, the Studios should not be afraid to hire Directors like Mr. Lynch - for every one who will be ""offended"" for unsuitable content, there will be someone else who will buy the tickets. Nevertheless, Directors that have an ""edge"" may find work hard to obtain. The trade-off is that they are their own people and their artistry enables the to hold their heads up high for not ""selling out"" to the conservative Studios. I have seen Eraserhead, Elephant Man, and now this one. Because it is Mr. Lynch as Director, I will get Mulholland Drive and the Twin Peaks TV shows on DVD. Mr. Lynch also went to American Film Institute( AFI), not too far from where I live.Mr. Lynch also did a good job on the Special Features interviews regarding this very different movie. He appears to not have an ego whatsoever - he gave me the impression he truly loves and believes in what he does - tells the story - HIS way - not the Hollywood machine cash-cow-easy-on-the-masses way!

The bad 80's hard rock, line after line of cliche, badly-directed shock scenes, and poorly dating slang and fashion sap all the fun away from this movie.

We were having a cocktail at a club and I asked him what he thought of it. In his broken, but somehow beautiful English he responded, ""Maybe genius or maybe bulls**t."" I've seen it over a half dozen times and I'm still not sure.It's probably my least favorite movie by Mr. Lynch (excluding Dune which I don't count). I think that's because it's too straight forward and is a very faithful adaptation of Gifford's novel. It isn't pure Lynch. I don't really care about Sailor and Lula like Mr. Lynch's other films' leads: they're just too stupid. Lula is particularly annoying.So why the high ranking? Because Mr. Lynch still makes one hell of a movie filled with unforgettable scenes and characters. Wild at Heart has an intense visceral charge from beginning to end. There are moments that I will never forget:Bobby Peru making Lula beg for it; and every other second he's on screen. Dafoe absolutely explodes in this role. Marietta Fortune's face painted with lipstick, doing the wicked witch. Girl in Accident worried about her purse. Uncle Dell: ""Making his LUNCH!"" Johnnie Faraggut's gosh darn school boy infatuation with the wicked witch. 00 Spool: ""My dog barks some. Mentally you picture my dog, but I have not told you the type of dog which I have.

147,omelette007,Lynch attempts to out-Lynch himself,5,12 March 2012,"Wild at Heart is not without superb elements, but overall, it's a disappointment. Lynch did what has been deadly to so many talented filmmakers - he bought into his own reputation. Wild at Heart is highly self-aware, furiously cranking up the Lynchian stylistic quirks with little awareness of the delicate balance that made former Lynch films great. Blue Velvet did descend into surreal, dark chaos, but it contrasted the depraved weirdness with common decency and compassion. Wild at Heart, on the other hand, is just a heady stew of violence, sex and bizarre happenings - very little here is recognizable as human behavior, and just about nothing as human goodness. If Blue Velvet was guilty of being a little too turned on by its own darkness, Wild at Heart is downright proud of presenting evil in a lurid, gleeful manner.Nevertheless, if all you want from Lynch movies is memorable surrealism, wacky characters and delirious energy, Wild at Heart still offers plenty to savor. Parts of Wild at Heart do possess a mad energy and offbeat humor that is infectious. The performances are also highly entertaining - Nicolas Cage has rarely been better, and Dianne Ladd is hysterically funny in an utterly unhinged performance. But the madness of Wild at Heart all starts to seem too calculated, too soulless, and too ugly. The weirdness of Blue Velvet and Eraserhead almost always seemed organic, like a natural outgrowth of the film - Wild at Heart seems awkwardly scrambled together. Wild at Heart contains flashes of true Lynchian brilliance and a game cast, but they are lost in a nauseating, patchy, sub-par work.",Wild at Heart

How this dreadful waste of time was awarded best film at Cannes is beyond me, and especially after the year that ""sex, lies, and videotape"" was awarded the same honor.  The latter was a great film; this one is not. Even though I loved ""Blue Velvet"", I've never been a big fan of David Lynch, and this movie is one of the reasons why.  His overuse of descriptive imagery in this work is senseless.  In particular, the desert scene where the witch on a broom flies by, indicating a reference to Lula's evil, spiteful mother, who has a detective and hitman trail them after they leave together for California.  The scene where she was showing her anger after Sailor and Lula's departure was something out of a movie from the 30's or 40's; way too overacted.  It was just her grimacing and menacing music playing.  Nuts!! Listening to Nicholas Cage sing ""Love Me Tender"", and with a straight face, just about capped it for me.

I can't imagine anyone saying this is the best Lynch film but it's an interesting watch if you happen to stubble upon it.If you strip away the premise of the hitmen and neurotic mothers you will essentially find that at its core this film is about a couple running away from something that might seperate them.

I've seen this movie twice but it is one of my favorites, however I would not consider myself biased due to my appreciation of David Lynch, my own life with a situation of being separated from a girl I love due to her mother, or anything else.I think the goal of movies should not be solely to entertain, to pass the time, or anything like that- movies like this exist, and some like to watch them only for that value. But I consider those a waste of the short time we have to live.Movies which impart you with something that is relevant to your real life, and leave you with something, a feeling, some meaning of some sort, some sort of belief in a good thing, these movies are worth the time. That should be the goal of every artist, to make something that enriches the lives of those who absorb it, not degrade.David Lynch's use of very subtle yet heavy (to those who notice) symbolism, combined with the right moments of comic relief, and the general spirit behind it all really make you appreciate the right spirit for any form of art to be made with.

OK. Maybe Lynch really had that on his mind, but I thing that audience will never understand his vision of any movie. For example, Wild at heart. What is the point of character of cousin Dell? Mentally unstable person, OK. But what is with his moves on the street? He can't wait for Christmas?!? What is his character doing in the movie at all? Maybe he is just contributing to the bizarreness of film. And then, maybe you remember old woman in a dance club, just walking through the cadre with bizarre smile on her face. Disturbing scene. What does she presents? Nothing? I afraid that David Lynch also don't know answer to these questions. David Lynch's world is very attractable and enjoyable.

The violence isn't just violence, it is gore, and the sex isn't just sex it is, well, ferocious?  This movie pushes boundaries that I didn't even know we had.  But I must say, like a gruesome car wreck, I could not turn away.  For the next day all I could think about was morbidly overweight naked women, abortions, and heads being blown off. It is now that I ask David Lynch... WHY?  I know that he is a great film maker but I didn't need to see this movie.  I feel as though I am a worse person for viewing it.

For example, in the way he films the lighting of a cigarette. A simple everyday act , but so tied into the plot of the storyline. He seems to have fine tuned this aspect since Eraserhead. His earlier visuals were quite drawn out and only for the truly patient.

Both give memorable performances, if not career defining.
Willem Dafoe delivers the most riveting performance as Bobby Peru. A character we loathe. Yet we can't help but love Dafoe's daring portrayal.
Lynch takes chances through out the movie and it pays off. One of my favorite movies that was panned by Siskel and Ebert but won the Palme d'Or at the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. Lynch raises his own bar from his previous work such as ""Blue Velvet.""",Wild at Heart
156,Pbearadactyl,Watch the other lynch films first,5,26 November 2013,"I am a huge fan of David Lynch, but if this had been the first film of his I had seen I would have never given any of his other films a chance. This film is a mess filled with incoherent dialogue, pointless weirdness, and out of nowhere Wizard of Oz references. Most of Lynch's films have some point in their surreal atmosphere, but this one does not. This film is basically a criminal lovers on the run film like Badlands, True Romance, or Natural Born Killers, but while those films had coherent stories and plots this film does not. Our two protagonists, Lula and Sailor, are both completely insufferable and lack any redeeming qualities. David Lynch seems to not understand the appeal of Nicholas Cage because he populates the film with crazy people. If everyone is insane then Nicholas Cage seems normal. This film is supposed to be a comedy, but it blurs the lines between being intentionally and unintentionally funny. I would only recommend this film to David Lynch completists, and implore anyone how is unfamiliar with Lynch to watch Blue Velvet or The Elephant Man. I do not know why this film won the Palm D'Or, but i assume it is similar to the Oscars in that the right people win just not for the right film. I really do think Lynch is one of the best directors of all time, but this film is just incoherent garbage.",Wild at Heart
157,tseng808,Wizard of Oz meets True Romance,7,8 June 2007,"Wizard of Oz meets True Romance, that is the first thought i have after watching this masterpiece. Being new to films by the legend that is David Lynch, i am working my way through his films and creations. All of which i am extremely fond of. Back to Wild at Heart, The film really IS something else in my eyes especially for its time of release obviously with Lynch films audiences never know what to expect but can always expect the out of the ordinary. The plot when summarised to someone can only expect an action thriller of sorts, when informed David Lynch is behind it no one knows what quite to expect. The lead character is Nicholas Cage who i must so was fantastic for the part the way he delivers all of his dialogue which i must add the film is extremely well written in every sense. The dialogue seems somewhat very real aside strange moments within the film.But as a whole the film is a love story and a very good one at that. As throughout id say the film raises high emotion. Some scenes i must say have rather high suspense and on top of this the music is utilised so well.This review may be rather vague but i want viewers to go watch the film in a similar frame of mind as myself, and thats knowing very little about the film i was about to watch other than expectations i already had from Lynch.All in all fantastic watch. Though a little slow at times.",Wild at Heart
158,pullen18,Oh Dear.,5,28 December 2000,"What can I say about this film??? Well whoever view's this film after ""Jurassic Park"" will never look at Laura Dern the same again!!! I did not like this film at all.It dragged and dragged and dragged Mr. Lynch could of ended the film long before his ""Wizard of Oz"" ending, I know this is because of continuity (Wicked Witch, The tapping of the Shoes) but shame on Lynch for such a unsatisfactory ending. I'm probably the only one I know who didn't like this film, one friend of mine described it well by saying it was ""Dripping With Ick""!!!!! There are also links with the life of Sailor (Cage) with a certain Elvis Presley's early years (Wardrobe, his job as a truck driver and his voice) and I believe Lula (Dern) with Marilyn Monroe (Wardrobe, accent again). I thought the film would kick-ass after the first scene but it just drifted away into the Hollywood Archives or late night T.V listings!!!! Sorry but a poor 5/10.",Wild at Heart
159,pbmorgan2002,This Movie ROCKS!!!,10,23 January 2003,"In making ""Wild At Heart"", David Lynch has given us a diamond in the rough. The casting is nothing short of perfect.  Nicholas Cage, Laura Dern, Diane Ladd,  Willem Dafoe and Sherilyn Fenn give solid, electrifying performances. The supporting members of the cast supply a gritty backdrop allowing this fantastic adventure to come to life.Rarely do you see a film when the moods, sounds, colors and scenery alone play such a vivid and vital part of the completed work.  This film is true magic.  It allows the viewer to experience a world full of decadence, beauty, anger, love and betrayal without actually having to take stock in it.  I say this knowing that if the events in ""Wild At Heart"" were a part of your reality, you would definitely want to hide your red lip stick and keep a safe distance.""Wild At Heart"" A+",Wild at Heart
160,DeclanCochran,"A little uneven tonally, and not as profound as 'Velvet', but pure Lynch through and through.",6,28 September 2011,"I am quite the fan of David Lynch. He has a knack of combining the massively gratuitous and the oddly sweet, a pastiche he has been using in his films for years (Blue Velvet made me cry, and horrified; few films have the capacity to do either). So, I walked into this as a David Lynch fan, expecting the tropes I'd come to love, with a campy, hammy Nic Cage performance on top and the ever reliable Lynch regular Laura Dern as a bonus. I wasn't disappointed, as it was a fantastic film with virtuoso moments, some fantastic performances (Diane Ladd, whom I had no prior knowledge of, impressed me greatly), and a fantastic tone that marries campy satire with gut-wrenching violence. Yet there was no denying that this was a slighter affair than his best work, and it falls short of being the epic that Blue Velvet or Mulholland were.It tells the tale of Sailor Ripley (a hypnotic Cage), a man just released from prison (he was put there for killing a man hired to kill him and his girlfriend). He goes on the run with his girlfriend, Talulah (Dern), much to the histrionics of her mother, who hires a hit-man to kill him and her. On the young couple's bizarre road trip they meet a variety of oddballs, none of which are more memorable than Willem Defoe, in a strange performance that is grotesquely unforgettable.It has an ending, which I won't ruin, and several plot turns which I will also leave unspoilt if you aren't already aware of them. This is a long film, in which a lot happens, and you feel a little bit like you have gone on the road trip with them. It is never too busy, though, and some shots pan out, showing the expanse of the deserts that the couple have got themselves into. This could be symbolic of something, but this is a film in which a lot of things are symbolic of a lot of things. I won't mar your experience by saying what I thought of it all.It is a queasy film, too, and it doesn't skimp out on the violence (although there is no denying that it has dated somewhat) or the gratuitous sex (which hasn't really dated at all, to be honest), but if you're a Lynch-ite like me, then you won't be offended or off-put by it, but you will admire Lynch's verve, and his bravery to put such un P-C things in his films. Very anti-establishment.It's flaws. It suffers from repetition. Quite a lot of it. It also drags on ten minutes too long, a little bit of speed could have given the deterioration of the couple's journey a bit more impact, instead of just being a touch inevitable and predictable. The ending feels a little bit unnecessary.That said, these are niggles in the grand scheme of things, and this is a rare film that manages to provoke a reaction from every person who watches it. Even now it is quite lurid, and it's content would be faintly shocking to most, and offensive to others. It isn't completely accessible, but any film fan worth their salt should really fit this one in at some point in their lives. A brilliant, unforgettable film on the whole.",Wild at Heart

I cant believe Nicolas Cage took part in... I have no words to comment more than this, however, have to fulfill this requirement in order my post to be approved. Movies like this should get banned or at least not earning any profit. It is only killing, fuc..., body parts, blood, etc. I am sick of violence all around us in real life, now have to watch 2 hours of such mess. I thought this movie would present something ""wild"" in a good way, unfortunately, only violence and nothing more. I have nothing else to say but waste my time watching this so called ""movie"".

162,bigguy728,"Decent movie, but Lynch is not up to par",7,22 July 2002,"I recently saw this movie, and while I liked much of it, it didn't seem to me as profound as Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet, or Lost Highway (the three other films I saw by Lynch).  Acting in this movie is usually decent, but I have seen Laura Dern do much better acting.  I wasn't expecting much from Nicholas Cage, but he was decent.  The scenes with Diane Ladd were quite good- I especially liked the ""lipstick"" scene.  It almost seemed like a reference to Lady Macbeth (out, damned spot!).  Some of the Wizard of Oz references seemed a little too hokey, even for a Lynch movie, though they work with the modern ""fairy-tale deconstructed"" theme.  Otherwise, it was fairly easy to follow (compared to Lost Highway and Mulholland Drive), and I think it was ultimately done well.  If you want to see an excellent Lynch film, see Blue Velvet (easy to follow) or Mulholland Drive (difficult to follow but fun to figure out).  If you want to see a fun and refreshingly different love story, see Wild at Heart.  7/10P.S I can't wait to see Eraserhead and the Elephant Man!!!",Wild at Heart
163,dotcomthis,Happy days of David Lynch,10,20 June 2003,"David Lynch finally supplies enough real energy and humor to make a picture work.  This is the most wonderful film he's directed (through 6/03). A funny sort of mystery surrounds a young pair of lovers, Sailor and Lulu (Nicholas Cage and Laura Dern). They've gotten in with a bad sort of crowd. They both come from wild lineage, and strange beginnings.  Despite a lifetime of dangerous relationships and happenings, their love, and the good energy that gives to them. . . .drives them to overcome all the bad things in their midst.  Because they remain true to their love, and are wild at heart, they come out OK, though the world should crumble around them. Some of the dark and crazy characters around them reflect our own potential for buffoonery and disgrace, very darkly, yet humorously so.  The satirical theme of the film is highlighted by a brilliant musical score throughout, that seems to supply a perfect tempo for the film.

But thanks to early facial hair, parents who knew nothing of David Lynch except the elephant man and Dune and very lax staff at the local video shop I got to see it. I loved it as soon as I saw the back of Bobby Ray Lemon's head with the brains trailing out. And of course Bobby Peru.I've watched it many many times partially due to writing a long essay on it in media studies A level and in part due to really liking it. With hindsight it is not one of Lynch's best although it's not his worst either. Stubbornly weird but blessed with a hypnotic visual charm it really is very watchable.Supporting turns by Harry Dean Stanton and Willem Dafoe are both great and the leads have us rooting for them. In fact the majority of the cast master the disassociated Lynch house style.A hotchpotch of film references and atmosphere enhancing vignettes keep it ticking over between bouts of physical and/or psychological violence.We learn cars are not our friends and that you should never question gang members' sexuality no matter how much leather they wear.While a touch style over content it is very watchable if you like wilful oddity and menacing situations.",Wild at Heart

Laura Dern was incredible and so was Willem Dafoe (as always), only for their acting, this film is a must see. Lynch is known for the extraordinary characters in his films and this one is no exception, and probably, the one with more and better ones, maybe it was even abusive. The photography is excellent, it was like having a heavy metal guitar player on the camera, superb. I didn't like Wild At Heart so much as I liked Blue Velvet, Wild at Heart is more aggressive, while Blue Velvet was way more quiet.

You will never forget the characters as long as you live - how can anyone ever forget Bobby Peru and his nasty teeth, the psychotic mom, and of course the most passionate screen couple - Sailor and Lula?  This is the only hell I'd not mind visiting.  This is not the movie to be taken seriously even though in my opinion, WOH is pure cinema.

What they left behind will hunt them. But will it get them in the end? That's something else.Darkness, humor, surrealism, passion. Welcome to the world of David Lynch.

Nicholas Cage's character, Sailor Ripley is as cool as his namesake, and if you don't like the name, you probably won't like the character or the film either.Critics have agreed that the film has it's moments.  For me, the film itself is a large moment, with smaller, powerful moments inside it.  Overall, it's a clear example of genius.

Where in the other Lynch movies I did not want them to end..This one bored me and I did not care about the ending at all. Laura Dern is so awful compared to Patricia Arquette in Lost Highway..While watching this movie though I kept thinking that it looked and felt a lot like Pulp Fiction but not nearly as interesting.

179,MulhollandDerp,Lynch's Worst,3,12 April 2017,"I cannot believe this movie has over a 7 rating on IMDb. I am a huge David Lynch fan, I have enjoyed literally everything in the man's catalogue prior to watching Wild at Heart. This is the last film of Lynch's that I watched (Yes, I even watched the David Lynch short film compilation), and now I know why I had never heard of Wild at Heart. To start off, the acting in this movie is absolutely the worst of any Lynch film, and it has to be the worst of all the movies rated 7+. The accents of the main characters are atrocious and unnecessary. It would almost be passable if the movie didn't explicitly state they were in NC/SC at the beginning of the movie. Places where these accents wouldn't show up on their best day. From the very first scene where Nick Cage fights a man.. to the very last where he is singing a song, there isn't a single line of dialogue spoken by any character that seemed convincing or natural. This movie rival's M Night Shyamalans' The Happening in so many ways... minus all the weird sex scenes, which Wild at Heart has in spades. It has so many unnecessary sex scenes that by the middle of the film, I was starting to be surprised if there wasn't some random naked person in a scene. This entire production screams B-Movie. And by all accounts, it is one. It is ""B-Movie,"" presented by David Lynch.Now, let's get into the story elements. First, the story is nonsense, and I don't mean in the ""leave you guessing"" way of other Lynch films. This story from top to bottom is uneventful, forgettable, and long. There are so many blatant Wizard of Oz references throughout the film, that I started to ask myself ""why didn't Lynch just make an Oz remake."" It would be different if there were subtle similarities between the movies, close associations, or sparse references. However, this movie constantly hits you over the head, screaming ""Hey, remember Wizard of Oz, wasn't that movie awesome, sorry this one isn't so good!"" And that is somewhat the overall problem. There was nothing subtle about this film. Every single message it tried to convey was so over the top and obvious, every single scene was either pointless or it was entirely predictable.Lastly, the technical issues. Oh boy.. the sound editing. This movie suffered so much from poor sound editing. There were many times where quiet conversations were going on, and then sudden loud guitar riffs would start. These were so loud it pulled me out of the movie each time it happened. The cinematography was decent, which is why I gave this movie a 3. But, sadly, this is the only positive Wild at Heart has to offer, and it doesn't come close to redeeming it.If it was on record that this movie was intentionally bad, that Lynch wanted to make a B-movie, then I would say this was a success. I would almost say that it is worth a watch, knowing you are going to watch a bad movie. However, this is not the case, and it fully upsets me that this movie is so praised with all of it's glaring flaws. I mean, movies couldn't have been that bad in 1990 to consider this one a triumph at Cannes.",Wild at Heart
180,claudiasylv5,a love story,9,9 April 2007,"Wild at Heart is shocking, moving, strange, sexy, terrifying, and super cool. I recently saw this for the second time and had forgotten how intense the violence is, and how awesome the love story is between Sailor and Lula. The chemistry between Laura Dern and Nicholas Cage is absolutely brilliant. Theirs is a love with all the craziness of teenagers and all the energy of rock stars. And all the weirdness of David Lynch. The other characters on display are equally intriguing. Isabella Rossellini, Willem DaFoe, Crispin Glover, and Harry Dean Stanton all add up to more than the sum of their parts.If you're into a surreal experience this evening and don't have any LSD, check this one out.",Wild at Heart

I really can't pinpoint what made me enjoy it but after watching it many times it is still as good.  Yes, there are a few disturbing scenes but they all build the story of Sailor and Lula, two characters who belong together.  Nicolas Cage asking for his snakeskin jacket is one of the best scenes in the film.

I feel that those who see it as dated are simply too close to the time period. It is a ""timeless"" love story. To the men: Laura Dern's breasts are timeless.Lots of violence. Many sex scenes. Twisted dialog. Groovlicious shots of nothing important. Man on the toilet watching strippers. Heads busted open. Killer heavy metal riff repeated. Crazy lady with lipstick covering face.

184,lovefromabove,Something tells me the Cannes jury was bribed that year....,7,12 April 2002,"First of all, I must say I'm one of David Lynch's biggest admirers, so many people won't agree with what I have to say about him. I have defended ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk With Me,"" and this in the past so one can see that I am not the type who just looks at, say, ""Mulholland Drive"" and say ""What the F***?""  David Lynch is definitely one of the best and brightest film directors alive working today. I hope he makes more and more films that dazzle and baffle at the same time. One thing I love about his films is how they inspire such debate that makes the love/hate debate over films like ""Eyes Wide Shut"" and ""Dancer in the Dark"" seem tame in comparison. He seems to be capable of either being a saint or sinner of cinema with little wiggle room in between. In ""Wild At Heart,"" he seems to display both traits quite irresponsibly. So many people have said this film is his most amateurish and I think I'm one of them, but it has enough good to balance the bad as well. There is enough talent, titilation and compassion to make the thing rewatchable and wonderful. However, there are also enough testosterone-induced inconsistencies and Elvis, Marilyn and ""Wizard of Oz"" fetishes that bubble to the surface that make Lynch's psyche seem like a swamp as opposed to the clear pool that it can so lovingly be.The cinematography by Frederick Elmes is among the worst I have ever seen, certainly inferior to Peter Deming's gorgeous work in ""Lost Highway"" and ""Mulholland Drive."" It's a shame that Lynch didn't discover him earlier. Having read the book by Barry Gifford (who also co-wrote ""Lost Highway"") I know that Lynch made MANY changes to the film so that it would follow his structure of a Fairy Tale gone bad in the ""real world.""  But, besides that, it seems to be also be a winning tribute to the pleasures of non-conformity and irresponsibility (ie. love). I really didn't think the cameos from the ""Twin Peaks"" gang was really that necessary, as was Nicolas Cage's deconstruction of his ""Raising Arizona"" role. But I thought that the Elvis impersonations and the threatening sexuality of Willem Dafoe and Isabella Rossellni (along with the girl who played the freak with leg braces) make it have the prescence of a real dream. I didn't care for the vignettes about Salior's past and Lula's family (possible alien abduction? whatever!), but the music made the medicine go down quickly! Every note that's played in this film is classic! I really don't see why this was a Palm d'ore winner (but, then again, why was ""Dancer in the Dark?"") Maybe the jury just liked ""Blue Velvet"" a little TOO well. As with always with Lynch, the acting is top-notch (with the exception of Laura Dern, who just keeps pouring it on and seems so much smarter than that). The darkness does fall a little flat (Mr. Raindeer just didn't amuse me) at times, but there are some good ideas as well (""buffalo hunting..."" sounds like a precursor to ""silencio...""). I loved the locations (so refreshing from Lynch's usual backwoods/Hollywood settings), the drab cinematography even makes places like New Orleans and a desert hideaway seem SCARY as opposed to beautiful. Lynch's porno references are a bit much, but not nearly as rediculous as what he made Marilyn Manson do in ""Lost Highway."" Scenes like the Lula's desert radio freak-out, Henry Dean Stanton's death, and Sailor's stopping a bar-band's performance to sing to Lula are worthy of the Best-of Lynch, but the whole thing reeks of Freudian mother worship and beastily confusion. However, if you like Troma or John Waters' films, you really can't go wrong with this southern-fried Lynch tidbit. Besides, it made a star of Chris Issak, so it can't be THAT bad....""Have you been noticin' the build-up in traffic?"" -Lula (Laura Dern)",Wild at Heart
185,Nick_Vincent,Wild At Heart & David Lynch,9,10 February 2002,"Wild At Heart is a (some might say) typical 'Lynch' movie.  I've been an avid David Lynch fan ever since I saw EraserHead.  If your anything like me, it is hard to think anything else while watching a Lynch movie except ""What the...!""  Nicolas Cage plays Sailor Ripley, a young gangster that is trying to leave 'the life' behind, and Laura Dern (Lula Fortune) who plays his girlfriend, have to sneek behind her mother's back to see each other.  As soon as Ripley is released from prison, he and Lula decide to take a trip to New Orleans.  Harry Dean Stanton (a Lynch essential) is then hired by Lula's mother to track down her daughter and 'that monster' and before he knows it, he's being stabbed in the back from every which angle (from the back) and it becomes a coin toss to see who is the real bad guy(s).  Willem Dafoe plays a vetarin loose cannon (Bobby Peru) who is joined by Lynch vetarin Isabella Rosellini to sway the scales.  One of the noteworthy things about Wild At Heart is that it has a sub plot akinned to the Wizard Of Oz, which makes it that much more interesting, and which is where Sheryl Lee takes the stage in her first Lynch role (you'll recognize Sheryl Lee from Twin Peaks as Laura Palmer).  Crispen Glover is also a welcome addition to the movie.  His role is hilariously disturbing.  David Lynch is a master of disguise.  I love the fact that his movies (usually) start on such a Fairy Tale note, but then they progress into this awefull 'real' and often 'disturbing ' world type scinario.  This is where Sherilyn Fenn comes in with an almost arousingly disturbing scene.  He makes you want to look away at the same time your compelled to watch.",Wild at Heart
186,eric-whitfield2,Fast with good (bad) characters!,9,17 February 2012,"I really enjoyed this movie when I saw it for the first time,good characterisation, fast pace, and both Nicholas cage and Laura Dern plus William Defoe are very good in this although all play no-good characters.The storyline was understandable as well. Particularly like the Snakeskin Jacket on Cage it suited him for the part! A movie for people who do not mind watching flawed characters, as none are what you might call on the good law-abiding side!Nicholas cage has done some good movies and some bad, another one of his good ones was ""Red Rock West"" which I recommend watching.",Wild at Heart
187,krakxz,Like an intriguing nightmare.,5,23 May 2008,"Don't be too shocked by my 5 out of 10. I mark harshly. I'd heard a lot of Hype about David Lynch. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about so I borrowed ""Wild at Heart"" from a friend. To be honest I don't see what all the fuss is about...although I've heard Blue Velvet is the one to watch. However just because a director has made something great , it doesn't excuse them from any horrible film they made prior to or after. Anyway...without much further ado welcome to my next review:CONS: I did not care for the main story of the Sailor and Lulu, nor did I feel like there was enough character development for me to warrant care. The characters were just there doing things and there didn't seem to be any real explanation as to why.The story didn't really make a whole lot of sense. Sure the basic plot did, but there were other things going on that just seemed to come out of nowhere and took away from your interest in the main story overall.Too violent. There has been violence in films for a long time, but there is a difference between warranted violence, which is there to help the story or shock you or even be a stylized and funny thing (ie, city of god, kill bill) and pointless violence just there to disgust you (ie, saw). This film contained several scenes of pointless violence.Sexually explicit. Unnecessary nudity. There is some nudity in a character named Mr.reindeer's house which suits his character and is quite funny, but the nudity of the character lulu and others is pointless. Also some of the things they talk about were unnecessary and just seemed in the same category as the pointless violence, and a scene with sailor grabbing a woman's ""parts"" from behind seemed a little graphic.This film has several moments that made me think, ""The director gets that, but I'm pretty sure no one else could unless he explained it to them in person."" This isn't clever, it's bad directing.Too long. Being a film that never really explains why things are happening, you loose interest in finding out what happens quite quickly. PROS: This film was well done technically. There were some good shots and you never felt left out due to a technical reason. Also the various close up shots of matches and cigarettes and the use of color filters over the sex scenes was intriguing.This film is weird. If you are sick of ""cut copy"" ""same old same old"" characters and story, then this film is for you. It's full of wonderfully weirdo characters and strange story elements. The prime example being a man in a bar in new Orleans who sounds like a duck and talks about pigeons carrying disease.Also in a similar vein this film has a nice dreamy quality. It's not quite on par with Donny Darko, but it will be for some quite intriguing. Kind of like late night early 90's video clips.MIDDLE GROUND: The acting never shone through as brilliance, but never really seemed to drag things down either. None of the character's really had enough of an emotional background to work with anyway, except maybe Laura Dern's character which was played reasonably well.The soundtrack was sometimes great sometimes bad. Mostly the heavy metal didn't work for me (even though I'm a heavy metal fan.)ALL IN ALL: Really not that good, a bit too strange and unnerving, however has some interesting characters and a dream like quality.SIMILAR TO: An early 90's video clip. ANTITHESIS: ""The Usual Suspects.""",Wild at Heart
188,gr8tful,Pop culture satire,7,2 February 2005,"Wild At Heart, which I hadn't seen since first run, came across as much less than the sum of its parts, and I remembered why it didn't grab my imagination the way Blue Velvet a few years earlier. That being said, I admired Lynch's daring in deciding to take on the whole of American pop culture with this project. The Elvis and Wizard of Oz references, as well as the overt violence and sexuality, are not all that subtle, which is part of the reason I think that overall the picture misses the mark. Thinking about it from this angle, the picture ends up seeming like a lighter-weight, low intensity Natural Born Killers in one sense, Oliver Stone's brilliant, excessive, shiv-to-the-ribs of Americans and what entertains them.This picture is entertaining, interesting, even offensive at times, but all in all, far from Lynch's best work.",Wild at Heart
189,keywitness,Down the Postmodern Yellow Brick Road,9,20 July 2016,"""Wild at Heart"" is not one of the most famous films by David Lynch, but I think it is as worthy as his best ones. Perhaps its unique genre has been preventing a wider appreciation of the movie. The plot is deliberately simple. There are two sweethearts, Lula Fortune and Sailor Ripley. Sailor goes to prison for killing a gangster who tried to kill him. Lula's mother hates Sailor and wants her daughter to break up with him, but Lula waits for him. As soon as Sailor gets out of prison, he breaks parole and takes his love on a road-trip adventure. Wild at Heart has multiple allusions to the Wizard of Oz, with the wicked witch (Lula's mother) and the adventure and troubles of a little girl (Lula). Some of these references are even direct, like in the scene where Lula is clicking her ruby slippers. Of course, in modern times you don't walk down the yellow brick road – you drive. The lovers encounter numerous dangers on their way.PULP FICTION: Wild at Heart looks to me like a precursor to Pulp Fiction which was made by Quentin Tarantino four years later. Both movies are loaded with pop-culture references, which are a favorite fodder of postmodern directors (Wizard of Oz, Marilyn Monroe, Elvis, gangster novels). Both have a simple comic book-like plot. Even the names Sailor Ripley and Lula Fortune sound like they came from a comic book or a paperback novel. However, this simplicity is intentional - in the postmodern art the plot is usually no more than a loose guidance, a necessity used by the director to express his art. It's the same idea as when a jazz band takes a simple tune and transforms it into a completely new and fascinating art piece. There are many other similarities between the two movies. For example, the mobster's name Marcelo Santos resonates with Pulp Fiction's gangster Marcellus Wallace. Uma Thurman identifies Travolta as an Elvis man as opposed to a Beatles man – well, Lynch clearly casts Sailor as an Elvis man in his movie. But the main similarity between Wild at Heart and Pulp Fiction is the fact that in both cases we are watching an absolutely low-brow material – which normally we would skip - but are enjoying it as true art. We genuinely yearn to be around the characters, in the midst of an action, forgetting the fact that this marvelous artwork is actually built out of pulp. Tarantino will develop the same method even further with Kill Bill, but for David Lynch this is the only movie of such kind. One difference of the way Pulp Fiction is made is that the episodes in it are not sequential, even though you can mentally restore the time-line. Lynch will use the same approach later in Mulholland Drive, which is even harder to reconstruct than Pulp Fiction (although possible). The point is to take the viewer's attention away from the linear plot, from the comfort of knowing what's next, and instead focus on each episode or character alone. LYNCH'S AESTHETICS: There is a plethora of weird episodic characters in the movie, which is typical for Lynch. He always handpicks collections of bizarre and freaky creatures in his films, which are often unnecessary for the plot but create an intense mood. The pigeon- squawking man, the maniacal woman with orthopedic leg, the three fat ""porn models"", Mr. Reindeer (another typical comic book-like character) – the list can go on and on. This alluring ensemble of freaks and weirdos circles around our lovers on the yellow brick road. Some of them are just confusing, while others are menacing. Very few are amicable, like the old black gas station attendant who is tapping joyfully to Lula's dancing, his legs sticking out of short work overalls trousers as thin as the legs of the chair he is sitting on.ROAD HAZARDS: It feels like Lula and Sailor are the only sane people, devoid of evil tendencies, surrounded by hostile and mad reality - or perhaps they have accidentally landed in a scary fairy tale. Their journey to happiness hits snag after snag along the yellow brick road. The radio in the car keeps talking about horrible crimes and accidents on every frequency, and the atmosphere of distress is trying to put them down. They stop the car, jump out and start kissing. This may be their only way to escape, even if futile. Our heroes are alone in their adventure, and all they can hold onto is their love and the foolish snakeskin jacket, proclaimed to be a ""symbol of individuality and personal freedom"". But the clouds are darkening over them.ACTING: Willem Dafoe puts up an excellent performance as a remarkably despicable mobster Bobby Peru. He is repellent and attractive at the same time, and even Lula almost surrenders to him (remember her bent outward fingers – her ""tell""?).Lula's mother displays a harmonious combination of murderous and humane sides, lying and trusting at the same time. Painting the face red before betraying and dooming her former lover is a fascinating scene reminiscent of the ancient theater. She is evil and vengeful, yet so feminine and vulnerable.GENRE: So is Wild at Heart a road-trip movie? A love story? A fairy tale? A gangster movie? Neither, even though it freely plays with the elements of all these genres. In order to understand it, one should drop the perception constraints of any specific genre and start enjoying the movie as a unique creation. Then the movie will open up, scene by scene, like a good wine which reveals the depth of taste as you sip it. Overall, Wild at Heart is a remarkable postmodern feature, unique in its kind for Lynch yet in the same league as Mulholland Drive and Eraserhead.",Wild at Heart
190,zackkroll,I turned it off prematurely and was surprised to see the climax was 30 minutes from that point,5,29 June 2017,"Yawn.I had such high expectations for this movie since it's a Lynch and the premise sounds seriously bad ass. But it just isn't. 80% of this movie is just stupid dialogue (from a car), unnecessary sex scenes and Nicholas Cage being an awful actor. I was seriously looking forward to Bobby Peru and even he was a let down.As the title suggests, I did stop watching this movie prematurely. There was about 30 minutes left which came as a major surprise to me since there had been little to no build up at all and the movie was about to end.Creepy characters speaking nonsense (seriously, what the hell are the Cajuns even talking about?) does not make for a compelling movie. A swing and a miss from Lynch.",Wild at Heart

Not very included/understood by critical, that often says that it makes films for the single one, after to have considered blue velvet one of the 10 better films of 80`s. The cinema of Lynch, expressionist to say coarse, goes beyond the purely physical thing, and more and more it is entered in the cosmogonic abstraction, that human conflicts, we happened to conflicts about the life, the dark of soul and net not known, with great elegance, and incredible sense of humor.",Wild at Heart
193,acase-1,Not a 7 out of 10 movie,3,15 December 2006,"So after seeing Lost Highway and finding it brilliant I wanted to see more of Lynch. This one had a rating of 7 so I check it out (as I tend to avoid movies with an IMDb rating of less than 7). I was disappointed. The creepiness of Big Tuna, Texas was about a 7, but most of the rest of the movie was a 2 at most. The acting is generally poor and the ending of this movie is just plain stupid.The only other good thing about this movie is Powermad. It's too bad they didn't continue. What a great, technical, speed metal band they were.I was left thinking about Lost Highway for days. This one I hope to forget.",Wild at Heart
194,TheBoneJangler,David Lynch's version of Elvis on the Yellow Brick Road to Oz.,10,15 March 2003,"David Lynch makes the ultimate Wizard Of Oz remake, starring Nic Cage as Elvis.

Willem DaFoe is every dentist's nightmare/wet dream come true!",Wild at Heart
195,Alias1062,Lynch's Best,10,12 March 2005,"This is by far my favorite David Lynch film and perhaps my favorite movie that I've ever seen. To put it in a genre, I guess it would be a road movie; since the two main characters (Nick Cage as Sailor and Laura Dern as Lula) are on the road the entire movie. The premise is that Sailor killed a man out of self-defense and Lula's mother goes crazy trying to kill him. So Sailor and Lula run off, breaking Sailor's parole, in an epic journey of love and adventure.The direction of this film reminds me of a mix of Quentin Tarantino's creative in-your-face violence and pop culture savvy, with the far out craziness of a Stanley Kubrick film. However, the two elements combined are pure Lynch. This is the most conventional narrative I've seen from David Lynch. Both Mulholland Drive and Lost Highway went freely in and out of reality and fantasy, leaving the viewer with lots of brain food to snack on for days after viewing the film. Blue Velvet, however a pretty linear story, was a violent whirlwind of crazy evil and unreal suburban wholesomeness(not that that's at all a bad thing). Wild at Heart, though, had Lynch trademark crazy characters and weird happenings, but he really allowed the audience to follow the somewhat simple story of Lula and Sailor uninterrupted.I also really enjoyed the motif's that Lynch placed throughout the film. The flames of the matches whenever Lula and Sailor made love, the recurring shot of the fire, and about a billion references to the wizard of oz gave this film a close yet surreal quality.And any review of Wild At Heart is not complete without a mention of Laura Dern and Dianne Ladd's performances. Lula is so vulnerable right from the beginning, but Sailor makes her strong, and Dern portrays that with the most realism and sympathy one can in a world where you meet munchkins at bars and Glenda the Good Witch in parking lots. The final scene where she cries ""Sailor!"" with such desperation would make a grown man cry. And her real life mother, Dianne Ladd, also gives an impeccable performance as her whacked out mother/antagonist/wicked witch of the east. The scene where she smears lipstick all over her face is so powerful and that's all on her.Any Lynch fan or Lynch hater should see Wild at Heart. In my opinion, the director's best work.",Wild at Heart
196,michelehayes-13163,Pushes You To The Limit,1,19 July 2017,"David Lynch loves to make the audience uncomfortable. ""Wild at Heart"" is the best example of his work that at times takes thing way to far.I can't believe that this film won Best Picture at the ""Cannes Film Festival"". It is sick, evil, mean & twisted. The opening scene we see our (hero) kill a man by beating his head in. A few years later he is paroled and he & his girlfriend hit the road.At the same time the girls mother has now put ""A Hit on Him"". There is really nobody to care about in this film. This was made before ""Twin Peaks"" was shown on television and its fun to see some of the cast members make cameos in this. I have seen this once and I won't again. Its too violent among other things!",Wild at Heart
197,cyberlocoweed,Wild at Heart is a classic in full force David Lynch style,10,26 March 2006,"Wild at Heart is brilliantly twisted, bringing you all the warped out type of characters you would hope for from a film by David Lynch. The plot and story are so original and bizarre that you won't see what's coming next. Just when you think this film couldn't get any more depraved it will. The characters and situations are so insane that if you miss the satire then your eyes must be closed. It's like True Romance on L.S.D. Willem Dafoe's portrayal of Bobby Peru will both give you the creeps and leave you no choice but to laugh it off. This film is a visual marvel and a masterpiece of modern writing. However be forewarned this film may not be for everyone so I suggest that before you watch it you ask yourself if you are truly Wild at Heart.",Wild at Heart
