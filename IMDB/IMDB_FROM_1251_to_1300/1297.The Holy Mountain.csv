0,kosmasp,Vision Quest,6,23 April 2021,"How open minded are you? And I don't mean the very likely fact that animals again had to die for the making of this. With El Topo I heard it from the man himself, for this I can only assume, but I'd say it looks quite like it ... on the other hand, he had way more money to make this than he had with El Topo so maybe ... there are special effects. Whatever the case and your feelings about this, the movie is like ... an ""experience"". A journey, that you embark on - hopefully willingly.It is tough to rate a movie like this ... depending on how much you want to dive into the spiritual world. Tarot reading, religion (mostly christianity and or christian symbolism) and other things ""out of this world"". There is much to discover if you are open to it. There are many people who cherish what Jodorowsky did ... his vision but also his personality. Again he casts himself in this movie - though he has more people in it than before - bigger budget and all that.Of course most of the people involved were not actors - and his curiousity about people with disabilities shines through too. There is much to be said here, but as much love as this gets, as many other people are likely annoyed by it - this is not a mainstream movie by any stretch of the imagination. Wonderful set pieces and an ""experience"" watching might give you more than others ... mystical, mythical and mountain(y)",The Holy Mountain
1,gavin6942,A Spiritual Journey Into the Absurd,9,24 March 2008,"""The Holy Mountain"" is an unusual tale, deep in philosophical symbolism and imagery. On the surface, it tells the tale of a thief who enters the tower of an alchemist and is taught that he can turn his worthless life into one more meaningful. But then we get the symbolism: religious imagery, Tarot-inspired imagery and other oddities.There is a scene early on where the lead character, the thief, is thought to look like Jesus. His unconscious body was used by local merchants (including a cross-dressing nun) to make Christ statues. He is also followed by a teenage prostitute and a chimpanzee... and another part where he ""eats the body of Christ"" by devouring one of the statues. Just to give you a sense of the possible sacrilegious nature.We also have toads and chameleons dressed as Spanish conquistadors, a scene where the alchemist turns excrement to gold (the most blatant metaphor in the film), a gun made from a menorah, and a one-handed, one-footed dwarf. And this is just the beginning.Those who don't like excessive nudity should avoid the movie. There is an endless supply of male and female full frontal nudity, and a close-up of man's nether region being washed. Apparently, this movie was supposed to star George Harrison but he declines because of the nudity and specifically the washing scene. Harrison, along with John Lennon, largely funded this project (which was produced by Allan Klein).How to describe this film? Well, I'd say it may be the greatest film ever made if you like cult films. It's sort of like Danny Elfman's ""The Forbidden Zone"" meets Salvador Dali meets the Beatles meets a snuff film. If that sounds inviting, you need to check this out. If that scares you, run away fast.",The Holy Mountain
2,Quinoa1984,"Are you experienced? Jodorowsky's ambitious Rorschach motion picture tests human's connection to spirituality, and cinema",10,22 April 2007,"How does one start describing writer/director/star/master-of-ceremonies Alejandro Jodorowsky's The Holy Mountain? Sensational, outrageous, in-your-face, (the much overused phrase) one-of-a-kind, hilarious, self-indulgent, dangerous, and enlightening could be some words, and there could be more. But these are just symbolic of what one goes into seeing the movie. And what is it to see a movie, to experience it, Jodorowsky, I think anyway, is essentially asking? What about faith, or belief that there can be a way to surpass mortality and live forever? Is there truly any basis to become more than just flesh and bones and organs and love and hate and desire and greed? Perhaps, in the end, it might just be art itself. The Holy Mountain is one (bleeping) crazy art-house picture experience, where the filmmaker asks it's audience to either go on the journey and be open to whatever he's liable to let out of the floodgates of his consciousness, or if to be closed off then to might as well leave. So as it goes, really, with organized religion, which his own character Jodorowsky plays- the Alchemist- could be identifiable as.As I left the theater I kept on thinking about what it is to put total trust and confidence in a ""master"", someone who seems to have all the knowledge and experience to take people to higher planes. At the core, is what the Alchemist can do for the nine ""planet"" representatives any different than what a priest or a rabbi or a monk can promise? There is a level of intellectual stimulation, aside from the obvious emotional connection to the immense level of surrealism, that keeps one from thinking that this becomes all weird for its own sake. Unlike El Topo, however, Jodorowsky this time is much more in control of his own delirious dreamscapes and, in a sense, the genuine consciousness he creates in his Holy Mountain. He gives us, at the start, something a little much akin to El Topo with piling on Christian symbolism and imagery like its got to get into our heads right away. This part, actually, might be somewhat weaker in comparison with the rest of the film, if only because one wonders where the hell this is all going; a Jesus-figure, who comes into a village loaded with circus 'freaks' and gawkers at such 'freaks', and is put into plaster-casting to make more Jesus figures, which he demolishes except for one which he carries with him for a little while.There's more than just this, but for the first twenty minutes, which is practically silent and without dialog, we get immensely rich but sort of free-form symbolism, some that is great (the scene with the frogs in the representation of the Spanish conquistadors is absolutely uproarious), and some that isn't, like a strange scene in a church. But soon Jodorowsky moves it along to 'Jesus' entering the realm of the Alchemist, and going under his tutelage (and learning how, mayhap, gold can be the end result of literal excrement), learns about who the other members to go on the journey to the holy mountain will be. It's here that Jodorowsky digs deep into the nature of the period he was filming in and how fascinating and perverse human beings can be. These other members are all shown in vignettes to be ""manufacturers"", for the most part, of weapons, clothing, architecture, political espionage, and as a police force of a sort. More than ever Jodorowsky throws out the outrageousness to eat up, and really it actually never shows (and maybe it's just me as a jaded 21st century guy) to be as shocking as one might expect. Yes, it's extremely violent (watch out for your genitals, by the way, when around these folks), extraordinarily sexually charged (sex machines anyone?), and meant to be in poor taste and so over the top you don't know what is up or down. At first, I thought it couldn't get much better, as far as sheer surrealist entertainment value goes.Yet as the last section develops, as the Alchemist takes his pupils to the mountain to meet their promised fates, there's more depth than I would have expected, even from all that preceded it as already containing cast quantities of rich socio-political-sexual commentary and prodding knife stabs at correctness. Religion itself, as Bunuel did in the past, is questioned very strongly and seriously, however still in the context of Jodorowsky having his own subjective approach. Of course, the director- who happens to be at the top of his game here stylistically, second only to Santa Sangre as perhaps his most accomplished effort- did become a shaman himself to make this movie, so there is a level of legitimate connection to what religion says to provide us. At the same time, Jodorowsky is, all the same, questioning what it means to submit yourself to indoctrination, to ""nothingness"" as the Alchemist says to his pupils in their trances. It's not just Christianity that needs to be taken with a grain of salt, although that is very significant in the final section (the 'monster' over the boat, for example, has a lot that can be read into it, ala sin), but that it has to be in the person to understand what immortality REALLY means. The final revelation at the table on the mountain nails it on the head, and suddenly (or not so suddenly) things become clearer; the final lines by the Alchemist (or rather, Jodorowsky himself), make it a very poignant end to what has been a delirious, hilarious trip into consciousness expansion...In a word, or a few, what it means to 'experience' a film itself, and once it ends, you step back into some kind of reality. The Holy Mountain is a true love it or hate it movie. I loved it, even as I still wonder what the hell it is I just saw/felt/heard/experienced, and of course if it should be believed.",The Holy Mountain
3,BandSAboutMovies,Magical,10,11 July 2020,"I have no idea how to properly convey how important this movie is to me.Directed, written, produced, co-scored, co-edited, set designed, costumed and starring Alejandro Jodorowsky, this is a film that reduces me to tears at times if I even think about it.Words will fail to explain what this means. This is an absolute movie, one that can only be explained by those that have experienced it, meditated on it and have been changed by it.The story comes from Ascent of Mount Carmel by John of the Cross and Mount Analogue by Rene Daumal, an unfinished book that is nearly all allegory. The end - which is not an end but a beginning - is what Jodorowsky felt was the proper way to finish the story.I find it hard to watch all of this film in one sitting, as the bursts of images unlock such deep emotions within me that I can only fully explain months after the watch is over.Last year, I went through a professional divorce. In an attempt at trying to mend fences and rebuild the relationship, I gave away my blu ray of this film. It was, quite honestly, my most prized possession. It was an attempt to divest myself of material objects and destroy my ego, to lay myself bare and show that I was ready to continue the journey that we had started together. ""I want you to have this,"" I barely choked out. ""This is my heart.""I don't know if my former co-founder ever watched this film. The fact that it never came up again told me what I needed to know. I've grown past this pain, which nearly ruined my love of film.Instead, I have decided to move on, to take my own journey. The loss of this film was just the loss of a blu ray. Its lessons have not disappeared, the power that it has over me has not grown dim. If anything, I have reflected on my own path up and down the mountain and found that I have not regretted a step.Please find this movie for yourself.",The Holy Mountain
4,Hey_Sweden,"To know, to dare, to want, to keep silent...",8,5 March 2018,"Filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky guides us through a tale that is nothing short of eye-popping. Here, he relates a narrative just as much through his visuals as through dialogue and situation. At its very best, it becomes a compelling, highly cinematic treasure trove of sometimes disgusting and sacrilegious imagery, and retains a feeling of spirituality. Jodorowsky takes us on a journey that we don't soon forget, sustaining it in interesting ways for a deliberately paced 117 minutes.Serving as producer, composer, production designer, costume designer, painter, sculptor, and set designer as well as writer / director, Jodorowsky overwhelms us with striking sequences until easing into his story proper, as he plays an Alchemist who imparts his wisdom to a Christ-like thief (Horacio Salinas). As part of his teachings, he assembles a group of nine disparate individuals from different walks of life. Ultimately, it is they who will make the most important journey of the film.This will initially come off as a difficult film to truly appreciate for the average movie watcher, and I imagine it would only improve upon repeat viewings. It's a true mind blowing head-scratcher, with our director holding absolutely nothing back. There is nudity and there is gore, but I realize that to spoil much of the visual power of the film would make it less satisfying for the audience upon their first viewing. You really have to see it fresh for the full impact.I also imagine that this would be a popular film for people to get stoned to, but it still comes off as very trippy and surreal for a sober person.But there is more to this remarkable film than the insanity on the surface. Once you look past that, you'll see some very pointed social / political commentary, and criticisms of such things as organized religion and war propaganda.I haven't seen anything quite like it before. Jodorowsky truly is a man with a vision, a singular talent who creates not just movies, but experiences.Eight out of 10.",The Holy Mountain
5,lastliberal,You can change yourself into gold.,9,23 April 2008,"How does one describe this film? How does one describe any film by Jodorowsky? Is there any explanation that will give a clue to the workings of his mind? Any attempt to interpret Jodorowsky's thoughts and ideas would be an exercise in futility. he uses symbolism, mostly religious, to make a point, but what point is he making? He certainly has no hesitation to use the human body as a statement, as a canvas, as a message, as...I don't know.The use of color in the sets and the costuming was spectacular. The costumes (when people wore clothing) were exquisite. The set pieces were mind boggling.Any attempt to explain this film would prove futile. It is not meant to be explained, but to be experienced, enjoyed, and, maybe, to create a sense of wonderment, awe, and, yes, freedom. Your favorite mind-altering substance would certainly enhance the experience.",The Holy Mountain
6,christopher-underwood,Jodorowsky never lets you down,8,20 June 2007,"What a difficult movie to write about! Always enjoyable with some sensational imagery, this is amusing, thought provoking, cynical and heart-warming (in the best possible way). It is possible that, as I did, it might be helpful to see the wonderful documentary, 'La Constellation Jodorowsky' (1994), before seeing this as it could otherwise appear a little naïve or pretentious. It is, of course, a film very much of its time so they is much nudity and talk of searching for the answer to the universe by sniffing flowers, but don't be misled - Jodorowsky never lets you down. It seemed just a little overlong but I think that was because I originally thought this was all about the ascent of a mountain and as we go through depictions of each various planetary influences, I began to think it would be more protracted than it was. Absolutely marvellous and an essential view.",The Holy Mountain
7,gbill-74877,One wild ride,7,4 January 2020,"Certainly a unique film, one whose unsettling images will remain with you for awhile. With a great deal of visual style, psychedelic visions, and heavy symbolism, Alejandro Jodorowsky critiques religion, miltarism, crass commercialism, and the seamier sides of man's nature. It's a wild and surreal ride that will constantly keep you wondering what he's going to put up on the screen next, but often cringing when you see it. If you don't like gratuitous nudity, violence to animals, or disturbing moments (I'll spare the reader a long list), this would be one to avoid. At its best, the hallucinogenic images convey sharp satire on the world in a counter-culture, avant-garde kind of way, and at its worst, they're heavy-handed in their symbolism, and seem to be in there for shock value alone. That may be part of a larger point, to shock moviegoers out of conventionality and to portray the more disgusting sides of reality, but a little artistic restraint and subtlety would have helped the film immensely. I give Jodorowsky credit for what he was going for though, and I thought the ending was pretty clever too.",The Holy Mountain
8,ironhorse_iv,"Holy crap, this movie is so weird. The movie is a bit like excrement. It can change itself into gold, if it wanted to, but it's still kinda excrement.",7,31 March 2015,"You really have to be an open-minded to kinda enjoy the film. If not, you might find, this art-house film to be turn-off, due to its very offensive, out-there bizarre nature. Directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky, the movie is loosely based on two books, Ascent of Mount Carmel by John of the Cross and Mount Analogue by René Daumal. The film is seem as either a spiritual or an outright actual sequel to Alejandro Jodorowsky's 1970 film, El Topo. A lot of similarity can be seem, between both films, but for me, it's look like a way different film. This movie tells the story of a thief (Horacio Salinas) that looks like Jesus Christ, living in a corrupt, greed-fueled fascism state-city, where everybody is trying to find enlightenment. Tired of people mistaking him, for a prophet, he seek out a real prophet, a powerful alchemist (Alejandro Jodorowsky), that will take him and seven materialistic God-like figures from other planets to the Holy Mountain, where they hope to achieve, the ultimate enlightenment and find the real reason of being. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found it to be a thinking man type of a film. The movie tackles religion, consumerism, depravity, and others. The movie is full of powerful visual symbolisms. There are too many to count. All of them, beautiful shot with the camera. Some of those symbolism were needed for the plot, but others just seemed unnecessary or random. Birds and fruits coming from wounds! Was that really needed?! A lot of the imagery are WTF moments, like the dead bodies doing a sexy dance or the robot ejaculating. It was cringe-worthy & jarring. There were some LOL, corny moments, such as the thief eating the body of Jesus Christ. Looks like a yummy cake. Then, there is a scene where the thief riding a giant hook, while dress in a speedo. It so remind me of 1974's Zardoz. While, some of the symbolism scenes are silly. Most of them, do make sense, if you, deeply think about it. The surreal fantasy film might sound preachy and judgmental, but this brilliant exposition of philosophy through art, was pretty alright for the most part. The things that I didn't like, about the film is that animals were harmed while making this movie. Lots of mistreatment. Watching frogs getting blown up is kinda mess up! PETA would had jumped on this film, if they knew, what they were doing. Another fault, I didn't like the movie is Jodorowsky instructing, the audience is take drugs for the purpose of spiritual exploration. I, for one, don't believe with Jodorowky's belief, that drugs are needed to gain higher spiritual meditation. Drugs do kill people and wreck lives. For him to administered psilocybin mushrooms to his actors during the shooting of the death-rebirth scene is illegal and wrong. I was deeply surprise that nobody overdose, during the filming of this movie. Still, in some recounts, during filming, an actor on LSD almost actually cut off the other guy's testicles with a real pair of scissors. Another near accident was when a actor actually struck Jodorowsky for real, cutting his neck and nearly killing him. Jodorowsky reflects that had the sword actually been real, he would indeed have been decapitated. That's dangerous! Another thing, I didn't like, is his use of child nudity. Like his previous film, 1970's El Topo, I was very uncomfortable, in seeing nude children for a movie made for profit. I can understand, adult women and men, because they have a choice in the matter, if they decide to go nude for the arts or not, but children aren't given that choice. Other people make that choice for them. In my opinion, I'm not for censoring, but if they were something to censor, it would be the exploiting of children. I don't care if, it's the hippie 1970s and the parents were OK, in showing their children nude. Showing nudity in children is wrong. That's a big No-no! The movie could have, really gone worst. A scene featuring a boy around the age of 10 stroking the naked buttocks of a girl his age while both are in bed, positioned as if they had just had sex, was deleted from the film. If they did, keep it. I would call this movie, 'trash'. I'm still, surprise, on how much of the children being nude, footage, they got away with. I'm deeply disappointed in Mexican law in this regard. They should have better, protection for children. Even people that fund the film, like Beatles George Harrison, was against all the nudity. He was originally up for the role of The Thief, but disagreed with the director over the issue. Jodorowsky stood his ground about it, prompting Harrison to drop out. Jodorowsky later expressed some regret over this, noting that Harrison's involvement could have exposed the film to an even larger audience. Sadly it didn't happen. The twist in the end could be surprising to some. Breaking the fourth wall was pretty bold. Without spoiling too much, the end tackles the issue of escapism. Jodorowsky is indeed attacking the world of images, of mana/samsara with this decision. In a way, Jodorowsky's film is one big joke on the viewer. It's reasons like this, why people might hate the film, as they felt it a waste of time. Even if one doesn't try to understand the movie, they should see the film for the incredible beauty and poetry. After all, it feels so dream-like. Overall: The Holy Mountain is indeed a complicated and visually stunning journey into spiritual transcendence. It eventually became a cult film. Despite that, I think the movie is little overrated. It's a bit confusing, and out-there. In my opinion, it's a good movie, but not that good. Still, I do recommended it. It's indeed an acid trip experimental film that need to be seen. At least, once.",The Holy Mountain
9,tomgillespie2002,Like nothing you've seen before,9,2 September 2014,"A man dressed like Christ wakes up drenched in his own urine and with a face full of flies. He is awoken and nursed by a group of naked children and an amputee dwarf, the latter of whom accompanies the man into town where people are getting executed and raped while rich tourists take photographs and clap. The Spanish invasion of Mexico is played out with toads and lizards as a crowd watches. Fat men dressed like Romans sell religious paraphernalia, and, after noticing the man's resemblance to Jesus, get him drunk and use his body to make moulds of Jesus on the cross. The man awakens, surrounded by images of himself on the cross. He screams and begins to smash the figures with his bare hands. After this, things begin to get really weird.Hot off the success of his Midnight Movie, the psychedelic, ultra- violent El Topo (1970), Alejandro Jodorowsky was given a decent budget for his follow-up. Experimenting with sleep deprivation, spiritualist meditation and, of course, LSD, the result would be one of the most visually arresting films ever made, and also one of the strangest. The target is religion, but more of man's interpretation of religion to suit his own needs. The Holy Mountain of the title is the key to immortality, but the collection of capitalists, exploiters and thugs who embark on the journey seek all the answers in order to escape the horrors of the world they're directly responsible for.Jodorowsky has a real gift for the image. Whether it's the sublime, kitsch interiors of the Alchemist's (Jodorowsky himself) room, located at the top of a huge tower which the man dressed like Jesus, billed as the Thief (Horacio Salinas), has to ascend perched on a giant hook, or the truly grotesque sight of flayed goats paraded around a town on poles, he knows how to grab your attention. The film switches gleefully between horror, satire, farce and sometimes camp, like the machine that needs to be penetrated sexually with a huge electric phallus before it will open and allow you to operate it. This scene is part of a collection of vignettes that makes up the central section, as we meet the seven chosen to journey to The Holy Mountain.Unseen for around 30 years, The Holy Mountain found itself in distribution purgatory, until it was recently re-released and given the sort of remastering it deserved. It is a kaleidoscope of acid-trip imagery, and Jodorowsky throws politics, sociology and history into the mix to make one enlightening experience. Embracing the free-form storytelling of Federico Fellini and, especially, Luis Bunuel, it may frustrate with it's lack of narrative structure, but artists like Jodorowsky shouldn't be shackled with such formalities. Scandalous, beautiful, horrifying and often baffling, The Holy Mountain is an experience that will no doubt remain with you for days, possibly longer, but whatever your view, it's like nothing you've seen before.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",The Holy Mountain

12,jzappa,Unprecedented Visual Stream of Consciousness,8,28 February 2009,"The Holy Mountain, from beginning to end, is unprecedented visual stream of consciousness. How to gather all the pieces of it together in order to describe it cohesively, I don't know, but that is not to say that it leads to nowhere. Though, that's not to say it doesn't either. There is a painting in the Cincinnati Art Museum that reminds me of its structure. It is apparently a portrait of the subconscious, colors, shapes and vectors seemingly exploding from an unassuming black dot in the middle. But what makes the film so astonishing is not simply its explosive, hyper-colorful, surprising, non-sequitary, often joyously sacrilegious juxtapositions, for it could hardly hold one's provocation throughout its entirety. The subject matter of which it's wildly composed is what ignites the spark.The tarot card The Fool tends to depict a man stepping off a cliff. This movie is The Fool's continuing adventures in the world of the occult and metaphysical. He lies face down on the ground, and is soon befriended by a basket case dwarf. He goes into a city where his resemblance to Christ inspires some to use his likeness for the crucifixes which they sell. Sooner or later, after a psychedelic carnival of non-sequitary fellowships between time periods and other spatially incompatible creatures, objects and ideas, he notices a crowd gathered around a large tower, where a large hook with a bag of gold has been sent down in exchange for food. Wishing to find the source of the gold, he ascends the tower, finding an alchemist, played by director Jodorowsky himself.The fool is introduced to seven people who are said to be the most powerful mortals in the solar system. They are related to the planets in astrological terms, each embodying the worst aspects of his or her planet's characteristics. The seven consist of: a Venusian cosmetics manufacturer, a Martian weapons manufacturer, a Jupiterian millionaire art dealer, a Saturnine war toy maker, a Uranian political financial adviser, a Neptunian police chief and a Plutonian architect. These segments are explosively hilarious depending on how acquainted one is with astrology; I happen to know quite a lot about it, and so these introductions are most of what make the movie for me. They are gathered together by the alchemist who instructs them to burn their money and wax images of themselves. Being a follower of astrology, this completely absorbed me. Never has there ever been a film that portrays the Zodiacal planetary alignments and influences, nor embellishing each configuration with such broad-brush satire.After several scenes wherein the characters are led through several rituals, they all journey to gain the secret of immortality from nine immortal gurus who live on a holy mountain. What the film seems to ultimately be about is how we are mobilized by how fascinated we are with spectacle, with which the movie is overflowing. Early on, I was beginning to feel that I was going to have no way of connecting to the imagery I was seeing, how it was going to tell a story, or be cohesive at all, except that I admired its richness and vivid imagination, and huge involvement of all kinds of animals. But I was soon enraptured by the mystical subjects the film uniquely tackles, and Jodorowsky soon has me going on this curious journey with his abstract representational characters and being surprised and provoked till the very stunningly self-reflexive end.",The Holy Mountain

15,Polaris_DiB,"Not amused, to say the least",4,18 June 2007,"Following Jodorowsky's 1970 movie ""El Topo"", ""Holy Mountain"" presents more of the same: a post-modern reworking of reworking, a continually tangential relationship of story and aesthetics, a musing upon the nature of symbols religious, political, social, and economic, and a carnivalesque drama featuring dead or dying animals, freaks, tarot-cards, mysticism, and just about anything else he wants to shove in there for good measure. It's a lot more structured than ""El Topo"", but it's still the same idea... allow a character to travel through many different spiritual contexts to come to some ultimate understanding--wait, no ultimate understanding, and no ultimate ""coming to"", because as soon as it seems like the movie might actually be concluding, well, there's another whole continuation to take into account.Once again I find myself caught up with my own desire to see more pretentious art-house style experimental movies and the inability to appreciate Jodorowsky's film. In this case, his ""ah, but this is actually just a movie after all"" ending, which fits perfectly with his post-modern intentions, is still an almost insulting let down to an audience that has been following this guy for TWO HOURS! To have the sum of all the individual parts add up to, ""But this is just a movie and it can't answer the questions we have about the nature of the universe"" is not only a let-down, but obnoxious... we know it's a movie, and frankly we're here to see what Jodorowsky thinks about it. Tellingly, he doesn't come to any conclusion at all... it's just a play of images and motifs, restructured symbols and deconstructed signs, with a few tongue-in-cheek flippant disregards for commercial value.So sure. He can have his fun. But if I'm going to watch something that goes nowhere, I prefer it not actually go anywhere instead of literally leading me on a pilgrimage to do it.--PolarisDiB",The Holy Mountain
16,Stevieboy666,Visually stunning art movie,8,28 August 2017,"I've just watched this for the first time but feel that it's one of those films that requires several viewings to do it justice, so my review will be brief & simple. A visually stunning, often bizarre movie that features sex, death, religion, violence, drugs, animals, excrement & of course a mountain. Each scene is played out like a work of art, it's a sight to behold. I think that I understood the point of the film but wouldn't dare attempt to try & put into words.

17,Witchfinder-General-666,"Jodorowsky's Most Bizarre, Profound And Ingenious Masterpiece - Unlike Anything You Have Ever Seen!",10,16 December 2008,"Alejandro Jodorowsky is, without any doubt, one of the most unique and unconventional filmmakers of all-time. As far as I am concerned, Jodorowsky is also one of the most brilliant filmmakers of all-time. Jodorowsky's bizarre and ingenious cinema is simply without comparison, as this Chilean master of the surreal never allowed himself to be narrowed down by Genre, or any conventional rules of film-making. Whether one likes it or not, it is undeniable that Jodorowsky's cinema is exceptional - and for a fan of exceptional cinema, films like ""The Holy Mountain"" are the most exceptional experience possible. I've personally been a great Jodorowsky fan ever since seeing ""El Topo"" (1970) and ""Santa Sangre"" (1989), both of which are masterpieces and instant personal favorites that I rated at a well-deserved 10/10. This film, however, impressed me even more than the two aforementioned films. ""The Holy Mountain"" of 1973 is Jodorowsky's most surreal and most brilliant masterpiece, and no other film I've seen (with the exception of Jodorowsky's other work) could possibly compare to it. The film is bizarre beyond comparison, and yet, even though one might never completely understand what it all means, it is ingeniously to the point in many aspects. The mere try to give a plot synopsis would be pointless, as ""The Holy Mountain"" is a film that cannot be described merely in words - ""The Holy Mountain"" is a film that has to be seen, or, more precisely, that has to be experienced, in order even to have the slightest idea what it is about.The film begins with the incredibly surreal and yet profoundly impressive scenes in which a Christ-like figure encounters grotesque situations and bizarre religious imagery... This is only a very vague description of the beginning of ""The Holy Mountain"", but describing it adequately simply isn't possible - and if it was, it would not be desirable to do so, as this film is a unique work of art which all that are even slightly interested in cinema MUST experience for themselves. Beatles legend John Lennon was reportedly so impressed by ""El Topo"", that he convinced manager Allen Klein to finance this film. The obvious higher budget allowed Jodorowsky to build up incredible settings for ""The Holy Mountain"". Jodororowsky's masterpiece is overwhelming in all aspects imaginable - be it the brilliantly grotesque imagery, the ingeniously bizarre plot that is impossible to properly describe, or the countless sequences and subplots in which the film spoofs all kinds if institutions such as governments, the church, or modern artistic pretentiousness alike. The film sarcastically points out the corruption, hypocrisy and brutality of the world in a most brilliant manner that is both shocking and ironic to a point that is sometimes hilarious. All that is presented in a unique, purely Jodorowsky-esquire atmosphere, accompanied by an insanely brilliant score. Jodorowsky never used famous actors in his films (except for ""The Raibow Thief"" which I haven't seen), in fact many of the actors in his films never participated anywhere else, but it is obvious that all those involved were absolutely committed to Jodorowsky and the brilliance of his work. Jodorowsky himself, once again, stars in the film, this time as 'The Alchemist', a role which, once again, cannot properly be described in words. Jodorowsky's trademark casting of people with handicaps and deformities in supporting roles (which was also the case in ""El Topo"" and ""Santa Sangre"") sometimes reminds me of Tod Browning's 1932 masterpiece ""Freaks"", and, as it is the case in Browning's milestone, it can never possibly be misinterpret end as voyeurism. On the contrary, these people are shown in an incomparably more positive light than most of the others, and then again, it is hard to determine whether or not anyone in the film is really meant to appear as 'positive'. On could possibly go on puzzling about what the film is supposed to mean, and never come to a conclusion, even after watching it ten times and philosophizing about it after each viewing. It is, however, without any doubt that this is an absolute must-see for every lover of film. The first twenty minutes alone are among the most unforgettable cinematic experiences one can have, and there is a lot more to come. My review of ""The Holy Mountain"" may not even vaguely point out what an overwhelming experience this is, but, if it encourages anyone to see the film, I will be more than satisfied. In short: ""The Holy Mountain"" is Jodorowsky's most brilliant film and one of the greatest cinematic experiences one can have. 10 out of 10, and if it was possible, I'd even reward it with a higher rating!",The Holy Mountain
18,truemythmedia,A Spiritual Ascension,10,18 July 2019,"Alejandro Jodorowsky's films are different. Even those who love non-linear story telling, esoteric subject matter, and mind bending visuals may find themselves challenged by a film like ""The Holy Mountain.""When in film school, I heard the name said, not in class, but overheard in hushed conversations between film teachers and on film sub-reddits. I don't think any of the students were watching him though. He always had an air of mystery and danger about him.I heard that long portions of the film were wordless, that there was animal sex, that animals were really killed for the film, and that there was an 'interesting treatment' of human feces.Was I ready for Jodorowsky?Are you?One of the reasons Jodorowsky is so difficult for the average viewer to tackle is because his purpose for making film is so different than that for which most modern audiences are used to seeing.Jodorowsky isn't just trying to tell a story. He is trying to create an experience. His goal is not for you to follow the plot. It is for you to consume something that gives you a certain feeling upon its consumption.He himself likened what he was attempting to the taking of a drug, except that instead of tripping on LSD you would trip on a film.That is what this film does.It makes you trip.Because of the unusual goal of a film like ""The Holy Mountain,"" it makes it hard to discuss with someone who hasn't seen it. It can feel a little like attempting a certain shade of red to a blind person but I will attempt it.In the plot summary I wrote, I feel like I hardly said anything about the film, even though what I wrote completely encapsulates the film's plot.However, the method used to unfold this plot and the cinematography used to show this unfolding are much more than what can be simply described. I can tell you how I felt and that may tell you more than what I watched just as a person describing an acid trip would do better to describe what they felt than explain the way that acid works.At first, I felt surprised, because the movie starts out very abruptly. As the first images of a man shaving two very similar women's heads gave way to others I found myself confused and trying to catch up with what was happening. I felt a sense that the world was a very violent and crass, disgusting place, but also that there was beauty and complexity in its heart as well.It seemed that people try to find a way to be one with the world and find a way to live at peace but no matter how one tries, violence and chaos seem to flourish and reign over even the most well intentioned man's footsteps.Then, as he ascends the tower, I felt at last, the world was left behind and some great secret might be at hand, but alas, the secret is not what one expects and in the end, all the searching we have done has been spent for nothing except to find that there is yet another source of enlightenment to find.",The Holy Mountain
19,Samiam3,Good Lord,6,7 August 2010,"Like David Lynch's Lost Highway, The Holy Mountain is a film I'd be liable to recommend to a species of intelligence superior to man. This film is almost unclassifiable by human standards, except to call it a surrealist film, which is what we label anything that intentionally doesn't make sense. The film has a few neat sequences here and there, including a cute ending (even though it is a rushed one). What bothers me most about The Holy Mountain is that frankly it is in very bad taste. Its content is irreverent, and vulgar, and whatever the film is trying to say doesn't come out very well.The middle section I think is the best part. A number of individual sequences experimenting with allegory and art direction bode much better than the film as an entire hundred minute story. Art critics will probably look at The Holy Mountain, and be reminded of Hieronymous Bosh's Garden of Earthly Delights. Among other things both feature copious amounts of over saturated, unnatural colors and frontal nudity. The Holy Mountain can be plushy while at the same time kind of gross. The end result is a mildly interesting art movie, sometimes nice to look at, and yet it's also kind of repulsive, and not very smart. Might be of interest to art fans.",The Holy Mountain
20,Amyth47,A movie experience you will not forget any time soon,9,14 September 2018,"My Rating : 7/10Bizarre. Strange imagery. The Holy Mountain is an extraordinary movie experience. It's weird and so damn good at it. The filmmakers don't take themselves too seriously and I love that aspect considering the almost laughable ending. I have not seen anything so weird put on screen that it almost verges on brilliance. A very unique spin on religion, mysticism and fantasy. Don't go in seeking some sort of profound meaning or answers here. The director Alejandro Jodorowsky wins me over with his eccentric vision of cinema.",The Holy Mountain
21,framptonhollis,Almost Impossible to Capture in a Review...,10,20 March 2016,"""The Holy Mountain"" is a film that one must truly experience to get a grasp of. It certainly isn't anything you could describe. it's simply just too strange, beautiful, and brilliant to give a mere description of!In ""The Holy Mountain"", Alejandro Jodorowsky manages to make something that is truly new and original; it is something that only Jodorowsky could make. It is a weird, surrealist experience! At times it can be mystical and magical, at others it is quite disturbing and horrifying. There's definitely certain visuals in this film that you will never forget, whether that's positive or negative depends on your personality.Experimenting with various concepts and visuals, ""The Holy Mountain"" is an avant garde masterpiece full of fascinating symbolism, satire, and surrealism.",The Holy Mountain
22,Xstal,An Unforgettable Pilgrimage...,8,3 August 2020,"... with a crazy cast and some intriguing and indecipherable messages - you're unlikely to watch anything as off the wall as this, with images conjured from a unique mind you're glad is not your own.",The Holy Mountain
23,Sergiodave,70's art house flick that takes itself too seriously,6,27 July 2020,"The Holy Mountain is at times interesting, but not nearly as good as both the Director and some of the IMDB reviewers think. It tries to shock, and fails miserably. For shock see Ken Russell's ""The Devils"" made in 1971 which I am sure inspired Alexandro Jodorowsky. I Enjoyed it and will probably watch it again, but it is no visionary landmark piece of art, more a case of the emperors new clothes.",The Holy Mountain
24,mstomaso,Art - Don't Blame the Messenger!!!!,7,22 August 2007,"Alejandro Jodorowsky's Holy Mountain is worth seeing once in a while. Not because it's difficult to figure out (it really isn't, unless you insist on figuring ALL of it out at once). But because you will be seeing a different movie each time, as your own perspective, mood and life changes.Holy Mountain is a meticulously made work of cinematic art. It is simultaneously a brilliant absurdist farce, a cynical satire which lampoons religion and capitalism, an affirmation of faith, an indictment of humanity for its cruelty, ignorance and greed and a celebration of life and the human spirit. Who and where you are will determine your interpretation, so don't blame Jodorowsky! He's just the messenger.Ostensibly, the film is about a fantastic spiritual journey undertaken by an apparently psychologically disturbed young man who looks a bit like what many Christians believe Jesus to have looked like. This young man begins his journey with insects swarming his face. He is either dead or passed out. Some naked children find him and decide to crucify him for fun. He yells at them (incoherently) and they run away. He then meets an amputee with just a couple half-limbs who becomes his friend for the beginning of the film.This describes the first five or so minutes of the film's plot. Although the film remains somewhat linear and simply plotted from this point to it end, it also draws deep on all manners of symbolism, mercilessly pokes fun at Christianity, its exploitation and its commercialization, and even throws in some pop-Buddhist concepts accompanied by a prophet with a talent for Jiu Jitsu. The entire crucifixion story is repeatedly portrayed, but with levels of absurdity that would probably have some Americans calling for its censorship today. Later, our protagonist will embark upon an apparently meaningless quest to climb the Holy Mountain with ten powerful companions. Though likable enough, the hero of the film is neither a hero nor a clearly developed character. His (at least) neurotic behavior, his uncertain sense of justice and sometimes animalistic approach to events make him a difficult character to like, but you will feel compelled to follow-through simply to discover what bizarre reality he will encounter next. Holy Mountain has some of the most impressive sets and surreal to psychedelic imagery I have seen in films of its vintage. Its soundscaping and soundtrack is also very impressive. The amount of dialog is refreshingly minimal, which also helps the director keep his audience focused on what the film does with sound and vision.Although the film is gorgeous, sensitive viewers should be aware that there is some fairly disturbing imagery in this film. It is meant to be watched while wide-awake and receptive, but strong.You can find all sorts of meanings in this film. You can label the film many different things. And you can understand it in whatever way works for you. But please do not make the mistake of thinking you've got it right or that your interpretation is anything but your interpretation. Holy Mountain, like many works of film art, does not work that way.Highly recommended for intellectuals, connoisseurs of film art, and those who enjoy cult films. Definitely not recommended for those who approach film solely as a means for entertainment, and not recommended for a first date (unless the couple has a strong intellectual bent and an interest in film).",The Holy Mountain
25,Andy-296,Best film from surreal master Jodorowski,7,22 August 2007,"El Topo is better known, but The Holy Mountain is the best film of surreal master Alejandro Jodorowski (born in Chile, based in Mexico during his film career and now living in France as a comic book artist). Shot in luscious color, this little known masterpiece was unavailable for viewing for decades, due to a dispute between the director and the producer. To describe what the movie is about is close to a meaningless exercise: let's say that after a series of outrageous visual gags (the conquest of Mexico as performed by frogs?), some kind of plot emerges, as the Alchemist (Jodorowski himself) assembles a group of people named after planets (?) in order to prepare them to climb a sacred hill for some world threatening event. And when one less expects it, the movie's fourth wall emerges, in the film's funniest gag. This is free association surrealism: Jodorowski throws about ten visual jokes per minute, about only one really works, but this means you can stop laughing and marveling all the time. The movie is also highly sacrilegious and scatological, so it is obviously not for everyone.",The Holy Mountain
26,aciessi,Hmmm Interesting.,6,12 June 2015,"I might be in the minority of people who loved El Topo.. but I did. So I decided to check out, at least for a little bit, The Holy Mountain. By comparison, it makes the surrealism in El Topo look like a walk in the park. This is one of the most deranged, gratuitous and uncomfortable works of shock art I've ever seen. Every element of this picture is meant to outrage.. but at the same time, meant to stimulate the human mind, wonder the human soul.. and maybe turn us on? Who knows? It's too far out for me to even begin. I don't recommend sitting through it all, because again, to most people a lot of this is nonsense. But, it's a strikingly beautiful piece of nonsense. This film is gorgeous to look at. The colors, and textures. The mis-en-scene in it's entirety is mind blowing. This is Jodorowsky's most sensually effective picture, and it's amazing to behold, albeit absolutely discomforting.",The Holy Mountain
27,KnightsofNi11,What did I just watch?,9,27 June 2012,"My entire perception of reality and what the medium of cinema means has changed since watching Alejandro Jodorowsky's sacrilegious mind trip The Holy Mountain. It's a bizarre avant-garde film that uses strange and sacrilegious imagery to evoke reactions of fear, disgust, wonder, and mysticism in its viewers. The film begins with a Christ like figure wandering around a destitute city. He then finds his way to an alchemist who forms a band of men and women who will seek immortality and utmost holiness from the Gods who supposedly live atop the Holy Mountain. It's an intense audio visual experience that absolutely blew me a way.While watching The Holy Mountain I had no idea what was going on and trying to decipher all the images in the film is a near impossible challenge. But what I did know is that I was watching a masterpiece. I could feel it in the grandiose way the film was presented and the profound subject matter at hand. One set after another absolutely floored me in it's innovative design unlike anything I've ever seen before. Jodorowsky's use of color is profound and the simple yet ingenious things he does with the camera are beautifully spectacular.The Holy Mountain is a beautiful film and a disturbing film at the same time. It has a thick air of mysticism about it that strikes wonder and confusion into the viewer like a knife. If you sit back and allow The Holy Mountain to take you at its will it will invoke intense emotional reactions in you, but you won't even understand why. The very end of the film takes an incredibly bizarre and unforeseen turn that I never could have expected. It ends so abruptly and when the credits began to role I found myself getting a little misty, and I had no idea why. This is a profound film that does unexpected things to the viewer. Watch at your own risk because The Holy Mountain just might change your life",The Holy Mountain
28,eminkl,You'll never see anything like this,8,13 December 2019,"Bless Alejandro Jodorowsky for being so in touch with the idiosyncrasies of his boundless imagination. For being so candid with his views on political radicalism, militarism, consumerism, sexual exploitation, and religious fanaticism; for so supplely blurring the lines between the beautiful and the grotesque, the dramatic and the ironically comedic. For making ""The Holy Mountain,"" an artistically revolutionary masterpiece pioneering in its surrealism, its ideas, and its cinematic breakthroughs. Come 1973 and Jodorowsky had become one of the most exciting new filmmakers to pique the interests of the more adventurous of cinephiles. His 1970 classic, ""El Topo,"" warped the insides of the western and metamorphosed it into something philosophical and psychedelic - a game-changer both intellectually and visually, it became a target of ecstatic word-of-mouth on the underground film circuit, made fans out of John Lennon and George Harrison, and turned Jodorowsky into a cult sensation. But upon ""The Holy Mountain's"" highly anticipated premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, the hype surrounding Jodorowsky all but dissipated. Cutting twenty minutes from its run time to eliminate as much dialogue as possible, reviews of the movie were mixed and therefore kept Jodorowsky trapped in the same cultish bubble he found himself in after ""El Topo's"" initial release. Post-Cannes, the film still did decently well - it was an immensely popular midnight movie, playing for sixteen months straight following its 1973 showcasing at the Waverly - but today is ""The Holy Mountain"" better looked at as a forgotten masterwork, an overlooked provocateur of the celluloid never to be untangled but always mystified and maybe even repulsed by. The thought of a storyline is laughable - the movie's a rant, an illogical ramble doomed by its nonsensicality. For the sake of brevity and avoiding swimming in paragraphs of indecipherable ""plot"" description, I'll say that ""The Holy Mountain,"" more or less, is a satire of religious practice, esotericism, and cultural exoticism, finding its many layers through various vignettes that involve several individuals' attempts to find fulfillment or reach some sort of vague sort of enlightenment in their already fitful lives. But ""The Holy Mountain"" is not as cerebrally minded as the works of societal criticizer Luis Buñuel, whose movies seem conventional when compared to Jodorowsky's. Whereas Buñuel attacks his figures of interest through cutting dialogue matched by clever imagery, Jodorowsky relies heavily on his photographic techniques, his set design, and his staging - though Godardian narration sometimes guides us in the direction of assorted conclusions, all moments of monologue and dialogue do little to enhance the effect the imagery already has on us. And there's power in that. As a purist with a small capacity for films that prefer style over substance, phenomenal is the way Jodorowsky's able to so persuasively provoke with his images. What they all mean would require deep analyzation I'm to apathetic to undertake as of now, but his frequent marrying of beauty and violence are confidently mounted and extraordinary to experience. Like Federico Fellini, perhaps the only filmmaker that seems to bear any sort of similarity to him, Jodorowsky is adept at making his flurries of hallucinatory set pieces carry strong scents of meaning, inviting us to dig deeper into their essences instead of letting them get lifted away into the throes of the purgatory that is masturbatory directing. But ""The Holy Mountain"" never feels masturbatory because Jodorowsky is so giving in the sharing of his vision. There's wacky humor to be found within his labyrinth of color and crypticness, and getting lost in the film's symbols and allegories aplenty is an enticing notion, not a materialistic thought. Sure the movie eventually loses its momentum - no picture of its byzantine aptitude should have the long running time that it does - but before we begin to feel fatigue are we incapable of forgetting that sense of bracing erraticism that fell beforehand. You'll never see anything like ""The Holy Mountain,"" and I'm sure you'll never want to.",The Holy Mountain
29,raymond-15,Much of the symbolism was lost with me.,6,27 March 2000,"Religion, mysticism, alchemy and astrology set the mood for this art-house movie, one not expected to win universal favour these days.  It's an episodic documentary that re-enacts much of the suffering and cruelty of past history and man's unceasing struggle to gain enlightenment and immortality which is said to be found on the top of the holy mountain.  The result of Jodorowsky's production is a bizarre mixture indeed.  While some scenes are entirely original and imaginative (e.g. toads in uniforms) other scenes concerning the planets go on for too long and become rather boring and pointless.  Jodorowsky seems to want to shock his audience at every opportunity, and at first he succeeds, but one tends to become immune as shock follows shock.  The version I saw was dubbed in English and frontal nudity severely censored.  Both aspects tend to nullify or distract and most of the impact is lost.  To appreciate this film one needs to be widely read to appreciate the symbolism which permeates the whole movie. I am still trying to figure out the reason for the presence of the little man without hands and feet, and why one needs to surrender body parts to attain immortality.  Man is a most contradictory being.  In the days of the alchemists, he sought the magic principle that would turn all matter into gold, and later through the influence of religion, he had to divest himself not only of his gold, but also of all his earthly possessions before he had any chance of enlightenment.  I think the film starts well but gets lost in its maze of tangled ideas and symbolism.",The Holy Mountain
30,ThurstonHunger,"Supernatural hunger, surreal art and a so-so movie...",6,28 April 2004,"So people who are crazy about this film, are fun to be around, but probably just plain crazy. People who hold this film in contempt, are not going to be much fun. I've seen ""Fando and Lis"" but not yet ""El Topo."" I'm happily surprised to see that a sequel to ""El Topo"" is evidently in the offing per IMDB. Or maybe that has been the case for the past 20 years...If you typically like ""experimental"" film (and I mean stuff like what the Ann Arbor Film Festival showcases not say Cronenburg's ""Spider""), then you should be able to sift enough gold out of this film. But there is plenty of gold's alchemical opposite as well.Imagination erupts out of this film like birds out of bullet holes. The plot with its quasi-mystical, anti-corporate kaleidoscope of world religions is there just to connect the dots between artistic film. As such, you could call this a fantastic film, but a horrible movie. In fact, the more seeming contradictions you can utter and pretend to understand, the more you will enjoy the spare dialog throughout this.The fact is you will be lucky to find it, at least for now. The japanese version I came across did have genitalia replaced by white splotches...it did sort of dampen the hippie heresy vibe, but the Don Cherry assisted soundtrack more than made up for that.A lot of the set design, especially when then set spinning was visually inviting for me. It would be fascinating to know more about this film, what did the extras think as Jodorowsky was guiding them on his very obscure personal vision? How much did this film cost him to make...despite its off-the-cuff vitality, it clearly was not made with spare hubcaps and rubber bands.The mingling of myth is fun, and while some folks may use this to slake their spiritual thirst, or satisfy their supernatural hunger, I'm not yet ready to buy into the chakra and awe. Who are we? Why are we here?For me, I just wondered, how did Jodorowsky make this film?And yes I am glad that he did...6/10",The Holy Mountain
31,asda-man,Holy Moly!,8,2 July 2015,"The only Alejandro Jodorowsky film I had seen prior to The Holy Mountain was El Topo. I thought El Topo was one of the weirdest films I'd ever seen with a gunslinger traipsing around the desert with a naked child on his back and encountering a corrupt town full of disabled people. Could things get much weirder than that? Yes they bloody could. You know a film is going to a little bit off the wall when it has the line, ""Your sacrifice has completed my sanctuary of 1,000 testicles."" El Topo seems as deadly realistic as a Michael Haneke film compared to Alejandro's The Holy Mountain. I made a list of weird movies a while ago and placed Eraserhead as my number one weirdest. If I were to revise that list, I'd definitely place The Holy Mountain directly behind Eraserhead. It's that weird.Casual moviegoers beware. This is a film funded by John Lenon and Yoko Ono so it isn't your average Owen Wilson cosy romcom. Within in the first half hour we're bombarded with bizarre imagery. A man who looks like Jesus walks around a dreamlike town full of frogs in clothes getting blown to smithereens, Jesus statues made out of sponge cake, armless dwarfs, sex in the street and eyeless paedophiles. All of this section is told without dialogue bar a few screams and Baldy Man styled gibberish.I was so taken back at the sheer amount of strangeness. Every single shot has severely strange imagery in it. It's like a Salvador Dali painting coming to life and the pacing is so fast, especially in the first act. There's no point trying to read the symbolism because too much happens, too quickly. The best thing to do is just let the film wash over you like some sort of fountain of oddness. Even after reading some ideas on the film I still have no idea what any of it means. However, my guess is that Alejandro isn't a fan of religion or weapons, but he is a fan of nudity and animals. In fact, I'm pretty sure that they cleared out London zoo to make this film.The second act takes a slower pace, but is no less bizarre. The production design in this section is pretty astonishing. I was particularly astounded by the rainbow room which seems like something from another world. A kind of plot does kick in with our Jesus hero meeting a 'master' (played by madman Alejandro Jodorowsky himself) who plans to take him and a bunch of increasingly bizarre misfits on a quest to meet the gods. We're introduced to nine new characters in quick succession. All of them have a detailed backstory involving everything from orgasm machines to testicle collections. This section does get a little repetitive and lengthy but it's entertaining nonetheless.The rest of the film follows the oddballs on the quest to meet the gods. Compared to the weirdness overload we've been having, this section does feel a little less weird so it's less memorable. I do have to say though that it acuminates into one of the best endings to a film I've ever seen. It's incredibly jarring and the most postmodern thing I've seen since The Cabin in the Woods.So what else can I say about The Holy Mountain? As its trailer states, it's a film which defies conventional plot and criticism. It's like a piece of art or music. It's something you have to feel and depending on what you felt, you either like it or you don't! As a connoisseur of the weird, I really liked it. It definitely leaves an impression and leaves you with an army of images you won't forget in a hurry. Unfortunately, it's not quite as hypnotic and dreamlike as it could've been thanks (or no thanks) to Alejandro's directing style. The film feels quite detached and objective. I think the film would've been stronger if it was seen more through the eyes of the Jesus character. The reason I love David Lynch films so much is that he takes us on an experience with the characters. Alejandro shoots like we're just spectators and so part of the experience is lost.The Holy Mountain is still an extraordinary film though. It's rich and full of surrealist imagery. It's almost like the ultimate surreal film with so much impenetrable symbolism crammed in to make your brain melt. Most average moviegoers won't make it pass the first ten minutes, but then again why would an average moviegoer attain a copy of The Holy Mountain? For the rest of us weirdos, this is unmissable!",The Holy Mountain
32,haildevilman,A lost classic!,10,3 May 2006,"This was better than anything that came out that decade.Subversion, religion, terror, art...name it, it was here.Jodorowsky made great-looking films. Usually, they were hard to follow. But they were so beautifully shot, it was hard to turn away. Holy Mountain is an exception. The payoff was priceless. The characters were developed nicely. And his trademark imagery was as good as ever.I do wonder why most of his films feature firing squad executions of civilians though.And the use of animals (or fake animal corpses, at least I hope they were fake) might not go down too well among the squeamish.Jodorowski never made a bad film. THIS was his best. That says plenty.",The Holy Mountain
33,elicopperman,Film at its Most Spiritual Form,10,12 November 2021,"In the early 70s, Chilean-born French filmmaker Alejandro Jodorowsky broke out into the mainstream with his avant-garde underground hit from Mexico, El Topo. It did so well that music legends John Lennon and Yoko Ono and Beatles manager Allen Klein helped him secure funding for his next feature, The Holy Mountain. Although only screened in limited art house theaters in its original 1973 release and being out of circulation for thirty years, it has now been regarded as a cultural phenomenon amongst the younger generations for its huge depths in symbolism and visual eye candy. But why is that so?The main storyline revolves around a Christlike thief who ends up seeking a powerful alchemist in a corrupt greed fueled world. In addition, the alchemist leads seven materialistic figures to the famous Holy Mountain, where they hope to achieve enlightenment. Based on that premise alone, it's clear that the main thesis behind the film is the meaning of life, but the way Jodorowsky and the filmmakers execute that concept is so out there that you almost have to question what it is you're looking at. The first act of the movie explores the dirty seediness of a city where nothing but flashy scams run amuck, to the point where even the thief partakes in these charades. However, it also explores the corrupt side of religion, so much so that the thief feels as if his life has lost all meaning. Once the second act kicks in, it almost becomes a completely different movie just introducing every individual figure alone, as if we're entering an anthology of their own lives. As overly complex as the film seems from a narrative standpoint, it manages to say so much in just barely under two hours.In addition to exploring very profound themes of society and life, the film doesn't take itself too seriously enough to come off as arrogant. It knows where to poke fun at its subjects without taking its mockery too far, as there are so many moments where the power hungry tyrants get lampooned as much as the peasants and poor worshippers. Jodorowsky clearly set out to make a film as abstract and far away from the real world as possible in an attempt to really take advantage of the filmmaking craft. His efforts certainly paid off in the static cinematography, extravagant set design, exotic animals, and overly colorful props, but in doing that, he managed to say more about the metaphorical commentary throughout the film than if he and his crew went full on literal. By utilizing such little dialogue and explaining so little throughout, it allows the viewers to put their own pieces together and not have to worry about demanding answers. Considering that Jodorowsky himself plays the alchemist, it's almost as if he himself is guiding the viewers throughout the experience, yet only to an extent.Another notable highlight is the soundtrack, composed by Jodorowsky, Ronald Frangipane and jazz musician Don Cherry. In many ways, the soundtrack tells the story on its own, especially in the first act, but the film also knows when to immediately cut it out as soon as things get too chaotic. Arguably, the second act is where they really go all out in experimenting with the instruments and genres just by establishing the seven figures' own worlds. A lot like how some of the animals are treated in the film, these tracks can range from calm and harmonious to disturbingly uncomfortable, depending on the scene. Throughout this crazy ordeal of a journey, so many weird encounters happen, be it with drug induced fantasies or dreamlike versions of a specific society. Finally, as it wraps itself up, it still reminds all of us that in spite of all the weird psychedelic imagery and commentary the film puts you through, we are merely viewing an illusion of life from the perspective of someone projecting a spiritual experience onto you. No trickery, no dishonesty, no pretension, just a film that speaks its own mind.As an absurdist vision into the future if certain aspects of society are left unchecked, The Holy Mountain marks just one of many bizarre flicks in Alejandro Jodorowsky's unique filmography. If there is any film that has ever come close to feeling like a purely religious experience, this one may in fact be it. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who loves film, wants to gain some form of enlightenment, or is yet to dabble their toes in foreign avant-garde cinema. It may seem like any other form of filmmaking out there, or reality for that matter, but it will leave an impression one way or another.",The Holy Mountain
34,loganx-2,Go Tell It From The Mountaintop...,9,13 December 2007,"This is the Alejandro Jordowsky film not the old silent one about mountain climbing, anyway this film had pretty much everything I wanted out of a movie. I've had it now for about a week and I've watched it over and over. Every frame is visually engaging, it's probably the most symbolism heavy film I've ever seen, but not in an eliptic David Lynch, these are symbols, not emblems, and they represent ideas not included in the film as opposed to representing ideas in the film, simple right? Its a pinnacle merger of surrealism, satire, philosophy, and science fiction. The sets, the images and the story itself blow me away, and the ideas though chaotic at first flow together seamlessly in the conclusion.This is not a druggie film with no plot and a bunch of crazy stuff, it might appear that way if you view it on drugs, or with no attempt to think about what appears on the screen after it's gone, but the film itself is actually quite complex, almost too complex. Jodorowsky is weaving together a lot of escoteric threads and symbols(the first scene is the Japanse Tea Ceremony) together to tell an quite simple story about the various ways we(and the contemporary audience of the 70's) attempt to escape death. If you interested in watching a gifted film maker at the height of his game paint a truly unique portrait of the world, look no further. If you want something truly bizarre and different because you've seen everything, see it. If you don't care much for symbolism, allegory, or metaphor, avoid this at all costs, there is no realsim here, but there is brilliance, and I don't use that word lightly.",The Holy Mountain

We are images, dreams, photographs. We must not stay here. Prisoners! We shall break the illusion. This is magic! Goodbye to the Holy Mountain. Real life awaits us"".The story is about a Christlike figure wanders through bizarre, grotesque scenarios filled with religious and sacrilegious imagery. He meets a mystical guide who introduces him to seven wealthy and powerful individuals, each representing a planet in the solar system. These seven, along with the protagonist, the guide and the guide's assistant, divest themselves of their worldly goods and form a group of nine who will seek out the Holy Mountain, in order to displace the gods who live there and become immortal.The Holy Mountain is one of those movies that not everyone is going to like, as through out the years the movie has been a mix bag for a lot of people. Many called the movie ""A pretentious arty film, with no plot and nothing to gaps on to"". If you don't like this movie then that's fine, I mean everyone has different taste in movies and not everyone can like the same thing as other people because that will be quite dull. But in my personal opinion, I love The Holy Mountain and I would actually rank it up as one of the best movie I've seen in years.Alejandro Jodorowsky (The director of the movie) is what a call a ""spiritual director"", and what I mean is that Alejandro is a very spiritual person and I'm not such a spiritual person myself but I do admire his work. Alejandro Jodorowsky work of art is so open and so transparent that it makes his movies truly unique to watch, and that's why I think The Holy Mountain is a great way to start watching Alejandro films so you can get use to he's style of film making. Everything Alejandro Jodorowsky puts into his art as a personal sense of purpose in them and the ideas he's got isn't difficult to make out in each scene of the movie. The Holy Mountain is a work of art and Alejandro Jodorowsky directing is freaking superb.What I love about The Holy Mountain is how every single scene in this film is so true on reality and how detailed the movie is, and all of that is shown by Alejandro artistic look on life. The movie is absolutely absurd and what I mean is without spoiling anything; these a scene where a women is sitting on this super tall toilet and I'm not going to break it down like most people have by saying, ""The toilet is suppose to represent her as an upper class citizen to everyone"", no, what the movie is trying to get across (In my opinion) is how absurd it is and to make you think twice about the things we take for granted, I mean just look at everything that's still current in present day life, back in the sixties, seventies and eighties are still present today and all the things we do are suppose to me you think ""Wow, that's retarded"", and the point of the movie is to look at all the things that have become normality makes you realize it's absurd.These a lot that you can interpret in terms of statements that's in the movie like politics, religion and social life, and the movie says so much about every issue and it's so true and timeless. Every single second of the movie is making a statement and the movie has some much to say that it doesn't waste it's time doing so.The soundtrack in this movie is one of the best soundtracks I've ever listened to. Alejandro Jordorowsky, Don Cherry, Ron Frangipane and Andrew Arnold were the composers and I thought they did a magnificent job. The music in the movie really dose help on what type of emotion your suppose to be getting from the scene. Once you watch it a few times and you understand everything that's going to happen in the scene and you get the music in your head at the same time really adds to the experience, well it did for me. Now for the problems: I have none.Overall The Holy Mountain is a fantastic movie that really connected with me as a viewer. The movie never sloppily pretends to be doing anything different; all of it is completely self-ware of itself. The movie isn't for everyone so if you didn't like this movie then that's totally fine, but I freaking love this movie.",The Holy Mountain
36,eagandersongil,True Jodorowsky immortality reaches through its cinematic beauty.,9,5 November 2019,"A mind-blowing journey through our own physical and metaphorical identity, a cat-and-mouse game in search of the miracle, a constant criticism of religion, and a declared love of mysticism mixed with the purest and most beautiful cinema are the elements that make up ""A Sacred Mountain ""Jodorowsky film that holds the viewer from start to finish, either for its beauty, message or strangeness.
At first glance we have a simple script that tells the story of a group of powerful people following a leader to a mountain that had granted them immortality, but not quite, first we are thrown from the ninth and last member point of view. , which seems to blur from the rest, its existence is already a historical and religious justification, its brief journey of self-knowledge, miracles, love and discoveries until it reaches the character of the leader who purifies him and gives him an even more spiritual aurea, are beautiful and already get the viewer ready for what comes next, the script changes their point of view several times, and this contributes to deepen the work, but the characters themselves are very two-dimensional, but it is difficult to talk about a script that carries numerous Mystical allegories, a clear hero's journey, and an anticlimax ending with a moral lesson, some errors of continuity and confusion are constant throughout the work, even But with a script that presents problems, this is small in the film, given its aesthetic beauty.
Jodorowsky once said that the human being is a semantic animal that is no longer surprised by words, this may explain the constant use of images that cause amazement, grace or distress, the visual communication of the Mexican director is unique, even perhaps not understanding In his allegory, we can understand the summary of his message, whether criticizing the Catholic religion or criticizing the viewer himself, who does not break the visual audio barrier and is trapped in the need to gather logic, similarly, he links the difficulty of we get immortality, not physical, but intellectual, ironies, war and consumerism, as well as political and religious provocations are very present, and we capture it amid its visual madness, at least the summary, at least the semantic, Jodorowsky says much in his films, but understanding the whole message is difficult, since the director has his own metamorphic philosophy. Jodorowsky is a wizard, a writer and a magician, until the clown the former was, now employs all this in his long, full of symbolism and beauty.
The scenery composition, costumes, make-up, soundtrack and photographs are impressive, the whole art direction itself is exquisite, with scenes full of life and feeling, a lot of practical effect and care in every detail to help make a film that is aesthetically pleasing. perfect, grandiose and able to convey his plurality and grandeur only visually, Jodorowsky was a costume designer, makeup artist, led the camera and even helped to build and paint sets, such care brings as a reward a timeless film that does not age or is dated, and that every decade, it looks more beautiful.Some driving aspects need to be mentioned, such as driving the camera which is used in a variety of ways, we don't have a driving continuity, the director frames as he thinks best for the scene, but his appreciation for a high camera on the crane is noticeable, which helps to further beautify your scenery and photography, clear with perfect lighting, a soundtrack that follows the same logic, which brings rock and pop but focuses mainly on a classical and oriental musicality, further loading the mystical tone of the work, The montage features three well-defined acts, although the first two serve as a presentation, which is unusual, but it works, and the film never tires.
Even in terms of acting, the great highlight is Jodorowsky, with his mystical character, the ""Alchemist"" that serves as the guiding thread that permeates the whole work, although the whole cast is good and fulfills its role well.""The Sacred Mountain"" is not a movie for everyone, magical movie fans worship it, extreme movie worshipers see its beauty, but to please all audiences, the long forties will not, given its strangeness that at the time had displeased enough, and today, it must be even more displeasing, yet Jodorowsky's magical cinema is beautiful, beyond two hours long, its cinematic experience, messages and direction preach true immortality through the decades of cinema, a beautiful and complete work that breathes and exudes Audiovisual and is the face of rebel and transgressor cinema of the 70s.

37,AnonymousbutDilpreet002,Not entirely meaningless,7,23 July 2020,"Seven persons from seven planets come to an alchemist to become immortal. They, along with our hero, a jesus like figure, go to the holy mountain. I see that the richest, most powerful persons are all shown to be those producing war weapons, cosmetics, sex products , the director is taking a dig at them without saying it directly. I like the part about the minister trying to destroy Peru as well. The movie shows many truths about the world in form of it's sub-plots, but the overall story might not sound meaningful.My problem with this one is the overdoze of graphic pictures. Especially towards the end, therr are scenes of animals chopped off which are disturbing. A frog boiling scene at the starting is hard to watch. And the nudity, it is over so much, it ultimately becomes pointless.",The Holy Mountain
38,OttoVonB,Makes the Book of Revelation look like a Winnie the Pooh story.,8,23 February 2012,"From the mind that brought you El Topo, and nearly Dune (oh, the tragedy!), here is The Holy Mountain, a reinterpretation of the agony of Christ through a kaleidoscope of apocalyptic vignettes, set in the modern day of some hellish parallel dimension.Those of you who saw and loved El Topo should skip this review and just watch the film. Those of you who haven't well... watch El Topo first. There is no chronological and narrative link, but since Jodorowski's films favor style and ideas (which might be putting it too politely for some people), El Topo provides a less chaotic narrative and something resembling relatable archetypes.Here we have near-total chaos. The massacre of the Aztecs replayed with frogs and toads to a leering crowd, shamanistic rituals in a rainbow-colored tower, proto-Nazis raping tourists... If listing it makes little sense, seeing it just might, and like El Topo, the only work you can really compare this to - whether favorably or not is another question - is Dante's Inferno. A passive protagonist travels down a maze of horrors to reach an ultimate revelation/salvation. If you can feast on the strength of the sights alone, it has unforgettable wonders and horrors to offer. If not, this is a great background video for a stoner party, where can skip through the more outrageous bits.On an inspired viewing, I would give it a 10 for its boldness, imagery and mere existence, but I can't. It's just too exhausting an experience.",The Holy Mountain
39,GeorgeRoots,That Rainbow Hallway Is Unforgettable Imagery.,8,21 August 2014,"When I first saw ""The Holy Mountain"", I said to myself I'm definitely going to see it again before I write a review on it. It is an Art film in every sense of the word, and never have I seen a movie of such provocative imagery that was hard to get through on the first viewing. And I've watched Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""Salo, or the 120 days of Sodom"" (1975). Watching it for the second time, I could finally give it a rating and absorb every prophetic sentence and scene only Alejandro Jodorowsky could execute so well. It's goal is ambitious and admirable and I loved how Jodorowsky managed to provide an ending statement so impressive, it was like Charlie Chaplin's speech in ""The Great Dictator"" (1940).A thief who has a bizarre resemblance to Jesus Christ, lies on the ground. After being strung up on a cross by children he befriends a footless, handless dwarf and both go into a city to make money from tourists. Some locals use the thief's likeness for the crucifixes they sell, by casting an impression of his face and body. The thief soon eats the face of his wax statue and sends it upwards with balloons, symbolising eating the body of Christ and offering ""himself"" up to Heaven. Shortly he notices a crowd gathering around a large tower, where a large hook and bag of gold has been sent down in exchange for food. Wanting to find the source of the gold he ascends the tower and breaks in, finding both the alchemist (Jodorowsky) and his female assistant.After a brief fight with the alchemist, the thief defecates into a container. The excrement is transformed into gold by the alchemist who says: ""You are excrement. You can change yourself into gold"". The thief immediately rejects the gold after being shown himself in a mirror, and the alchemist decides to take the thief on as an apprentice. We are then introduced to seven people who will accompany him on his journey, they are regarded as the most powerful humans on earth but like himself, mortal. These seven consist of a cosmetics manufacturer (Venus), a weapons manufacturer (Mars), an art dealer (Jupiter), a war toy maker (Saturn), a political financial adviser (Uranus), a police chief (Neptune) and an architect (Pluto). All are gathered together and instructed to burn their money and wax images of themselves. Once finished, their plan is to ultimately ascend ""The Holy Mountain"", to gain the secret of immortality from the masters who live there.Though my favourite of all Jodorowsky's works is ""El Topo"" (1970), ""The Holy Mountain"" at the time definitely feels like his most personal project. The only flaws I can find with this movie is the length of inevitable exposition when it comes to describing the seven people. A few scenes that come off unintentionally (Or maybe they were?) hilarious, never destroying the overall message and given the directors filmography, part of it always feels that you are suppose to find it unsettling and funny either way.Final Verdict: Other than that, the film is part eye-candy, part surrealist delight. I don't think I'll ever forget half of what I saw, and it's message never comes off forced and is explained more thoroughly as the narrative proceeds. I cannot help but find a movie of this calibre only comes once every couple of decades. 8/10.",The Holy Mountain
40,CMRKeyboadist,...Wow...,8,28 March 2006,"I must admit, Holy Mountain is one of the most bizarre films ever created. It took me several times to watch the movie to finally make it all the way through. This movie is such a shock to the senses and so unsettling it can be very hard to take it all in one sitting. I am not sure where the direction of the movie was going as the movie seems to be done in three different parts. The first part introducing this Jesus like character and a few of his strange exploits. After he climbs this tower (which at the time I thought it was the tower of Babel) he meets this sorcerer of some sort and then the movie shifts to something completely different. The second part is showing all these different people from different planets who seem to have extraordinary powers. The movie goes on like that for a while and then part three seems to kick in where apparently these people want to climb ""The Holy Mountain"" to become Gods. Now, I am not sure if that really helps to explain the movie, you really just need to see it for yourself and make the best sense out of it. But, like it or not, you will still walk away from this movie saying ...wow.",The Holy Mountain
41,Afracious,A phantasmagoric experience to remember,10,29 October 1999,"This is a film that will amaze the viewer with its phantasmagoric and obscure imagery, and will shock some with its over-abundance of crucifixes of Christ. It really is an experience to be bombarded with all the surreal images. The story, loosely, is about an alchemist (played by Jodorowsky) who gathers some followers to accompany him to the Holy Mountain to seek eternal life. On the way we are told by various gods how life is on their particular planets, and it is different on each planet with outlandish environments and characters on each one. Just watch this film with your mind wide open and let it astound you. It certainly will. It is one of the most surreal and bizarre films you will ever see.",The Holy Mountain
42,thedarkhorizon,An experience that changed my own visual art and my life - FOREVER.,10,21 November 2019,"The film is so hard to describe to the average person... simply put - I can't do it. It is so super bizarre, disturbing, mysterious... so many things, so many symbols, metaphors, allegories - nothing here is left to chance. Each image is packed with color, shape and meaning - and the ending pushes the whole experience into another dimension.I can't put into words how much JODOROWSKY moved my brain, heart and soul. I saw it the first time around 2015, I guess, after discovering a documentary about DUNE and tried to watch all movies I could think of ever since. I also went into the world of written words and read his novels, such as ALBINA AND THE DOG MEN, and let me say: these novels are JUST as weird, gorgeous and mind-blowing as his movies are. Thank you, Jodorowski, for providing the world with such splendid, deep and powerful images...I can't thank you enough here.",The Holy Mountain
43,NateManD,"Not just a Film, an Experience!!!",10,24 April 2005,"How can the average person describe the Holy Mountain? They can't, It's one of those films that is so bizarre that one has to witness it at least 5 times to fully appreciate it. Alejandro Jodorowsky takes every form of religion and mysticism and puts it into symbolic imagery, that turns into a two hour mind trip. The film is not thrown together, each scene is so chock full of strange imagery, yet each image has a particular meaning. The plot concerns, the thief, who seems to be representational of Christ in modern times. The thief awakens in the desert, almost crucified by children, he is then rescued by an amputee dwarf. After him and the dwarf share a joint, they travel through different scene after scene of surreal images. In one scenario a police state has taken over downtown Mexico. Innocent people are massacred, and birds fly out of their bullet wounds. The conquest of Mexico is reenacted by frogs and iguanas. The Christ character gets drunk with Roman soldiers, and they make a mold of him to produce statues for profit. And this is all in the first twenty minutes. The occult science of alchemy is another factor of the film. The thief finally meets the alchemist, played by Jodorowsky himself, and the alchemist turns his excrement into gold. The black magic of alchemy involves the nine planets of the solar system. We are then introduced to 7 of the most powerful people in the world named after the planets of the solar system. Each person is corrupt and greedy involved in politics, war or mass marketing. Each person who has their own planet, and a weakness is willing to give up their money and be reborn as a Buddhist monk. In a way these people are alchemists also since they have the ability to turn worthless items such as weapons and cosmetics into riches. Since money is just paper, in a way the magic of alchemy in everyday life convinces us that the dollar bill is of value. Many aspects of life are just an illusion, just as in cinema. In the Holy Mountain Jodorowsky proves to be the master of illusion like a magician. Also his character, the Alchemist has the job of spiritual leader to lead all of the 9 people to the Holy Mountain including the Christ character and the women with the Kaballah tattoos. Also the film is indulgent at times in it's Frued like sexuality and nudity. It is both strange and intriguing, both hilarious and horrifying, and one of the weirdest films your most likely to see. Their is so much that happens in this film, that it's almost impossible to describe. People who are looking for deep meaning in films like Donnie Darko need to keep searching, the films of Alejandro Jodorowsky would be a good start. The Holy Mountain is not only a masterpiece, it's a spiritual journey, and it just might very well change the way you look at the world. Not everyone will like it, so sit back and watch with an open mind. The Holy Mountain is one of the most underrated and important films ever made. 10/10",The Holy Mountain

Plus, there's a lot of humor.
As to the ""plot"" or content - some reviewers have pointed out that you need at least a basic understanding of the esoteric arts, the Tarot or something - well, I'm not interested in any of those things - in fact consider myself rather a rationalist - but nontheless I found the film thoroughly entertaining and intriguing.

47,IamROCKAS,More random than surreal or coherent,4,8 February 2021,"When watching ""Holy Mountain"", I couldn't answer whether what I'm seeing is surreal or just random. By mixing surreal and random elements, by crossing the line between supernatural and real, and by straying away from the usual formula of cinema, this media raises a lot of questions of what messages the crew behind this movie is trying to communicate. Even though this movie was released over 20 years later after the peak of surrealism as an art form, I can't deny that a lot of traces of surrealism can be found here too, though I'm still not sure whether a lot of random scenes were just the result of objective chance or not.According to Breton's Manifesto of surrealism, surreal elements should be able to destroy mental mechanisms to understand the ""higher reality"" and to me, it seems that this is what the movie tried to achieve. Every other scene is either shocking or out of the blue, trying to get us out of our comfort zone. Like ""The Persistence of Memory"" painting by Salvador Dali, the movie is quite ambiguous in the sense, that we can interpretive most scenes in more than one way. Personally, I find it hard to see some of the scenes as anything more than random filler that's there just for the shock value but I feel like there was supposed to be a message that I... simply missed.Overall, I wouldn't say I enjoyed the movie. I don't think there was a coherent story until about halfway into the movie and on multiple occasions I found myself thinking ""when will this end?"". I usually enjoy surreal, weird, and goofy elements in movies to a certain extent but sequences, displayed throughout the almost 2-hour runtime of this movie seemed more random than anything else and random comedy just isn't my thing. I tend to stay by the rule that random isn't funny.",The Holy Mountain
48,jimi99,hippie trippy jodorowsky,7,16 July 2007,"After having recently revisited ""El Topo"" after decades, and seen ""Fando and Lis"" for the first time, and finally seeing the legendary ""Holy Mountain"", I have a new appraisal of the unique and yet derivative Jodorowsky. His messianic complex is obvious, and his transfixing performances can be powerful or overbearing. But as a director of his time, he was at the center of an international hippie-trippy school of cinema.Not that hippie-trippy is a bad thing; I embraced and embrace the path of consciousness-expansion, which now is knee-jerked as the beginning of the druggy society but became a quest for meaning, awareness, and compassion. But when Jodorowsky practically shoves acid caps into the audience's mouths in one scene of ""Holy Mountain,"" he subverts his real message, which is nothing less than his exploration of the (Catholic) church and his vision of the real messiah, and a society that might exist if people followed that light.So profundity is natural to Jodorowsky as is farce and forced Felliniesque grotesques. ""Holy Mountain"" can be considered just as a trippy series of elaborate and often dazzling scenes, with random stories from characters from all the planets of the solar system (we're talking trippy!) but is much nobler in intent.It is obvious that Jodorowsky was influenced by Fellini and Bunuel but also by Kenneth Anger and the NY and SF underground, I imagine ""Inauguration of the Pleasure Dome"" was a big favorite, and Godard was influencing everyone with a political and visual bone, especially with ""Weekend"" which gave flower power even a greater activist streak. Jodorowsky's contemporary hippie-trippy auteurs were Makavejev with the great ""WR: Mysteries of the Orgasm"" and the completely outrageous ""Sweet Movie""; Conrad Rooks with the serious and stunning ""Chappaqua""; ""Zachariah"", a popular tripping American Western version of ""Siddhartha"" with a very interesting musical cast; Corman's ""The Trip"" that I've seen at least a dozen times, most in the late 60s, with the great cast Fonda-Hopper-Dern-Strasberg written by Nicholson on something lysergic; Roeg and Cammell's ""Performance"" which is as trippy as they come, as scary, as musically intense--sexual gangsterism and repression and true seeking with the aid of a mushroom. And I have to mention Gilliam's high-tech and high-tension ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"", with Depp and the good Doctor sizing up the essential consciousness-gap of the 60s, and jointly creating a great document of the fringe of the movement of the mind.""Holy Mountain"" is worth the trip even if Jodorowsky overblows the message and then ends it with a Godardian twist. But the age of Aquarius is STILL dawning, my friends...",The Holy Mountain
49,kneiss1,"psychedelic, surrealistic trip",10,27 September 2010,"It is very hard to describe this movie. This is probably the hardest review I ever had to write. (It's hard enough, since my native language is not English.) Everything is absolutely surrealistic and unusual. I have never seen anything similar. This movie even goes a step further than David Lynch or Terry Gilliam. Everything can be taken as a symbol - or even as persiflage, since everything is exaggerated or ridiculed. The visuals are partly so crazy, that it almost feels like a walk through a modern art museum. Sometimes you get the feeling, that the director had the ultimate brain storm experiment going on; taking the paint brush, not knowing what you are going to paint and simply watching your hand. - Your subconscious will start to combine the weirdest symbols with each others. Partly the movie is abstract art, partly it's self-conscious constructed. On this journey the movie will allude a lot existential questions - in the search of an answer. It will not actually give an answer though.This movie has more music in it than conversations. Something I really liked, because mostly the music fit perfectly. The visuals are experimental but worked out most of the time. Compared with other movies of the same age, everyone will have to admit, that the movie is visually on a very high level. I give this 10 points.

Some pretentious eggheads shout down from their lofty perches, telling the masses that this is the movie for the ""in crowd"", for the intellectual, for the enlightened, and you all jump on the bandwagon!

It makes people wonder if they're ""too dumb to get it"", so they fill in the holes themselves, all so they can be smart too.In reality Holy Mountain and it's predecessor Fando & Lis are just silly garbage from a silly, so called director. The only thing that separates him from other bad directors is his shamelessness when it comes to using the moving image as a grift.In other words, if you try to make a good movie and fail (like Ed Wood), then you're a hack.

51,AlbertCinefilu,What a rainbow of symbols and metaphors we have here,9,17 February 2021,"I find ''The Holy Mountain'' to be one of those very rare movies which are full-packed with symbolism. ''Parasite'' by Bong Joon Ho has symbolism, ''Do the Right Thing'' has symbolism, but you still simply cannot compare the level of meaning expressed through symbols here with the level of symbolism in other movies. In this context, you'd probably say it's a really cryptic experience, and while you're not completely wrong, after the first 15 minutes I have to confess the film is quite watchable, especially the more satire-packed part which communicates some really dark humor through its images and witty dialogue. One example would be a frame in a politician's art factory in which several artists literally create ''art'' with their dorsal parts. Another sadly laughable moment that makes itself obvious through its straightness would be that of some soldiers who, after they consume a drug called ''war'' , repeatedly throw themselves into the sharp edges of their guns, all this while laughing like evil, satisfied maniacs.I've never heard of Alejandro Jodorowsky but the craziness and mad genius of his imagination is up there with Charlie Kaufman and other unconventional screenwriters.

Unfortunately, it was filmed in reverse--it starts with the exciting climax and works towards a boring, quiet ending. It's also long. And it's hard to find a decent copy. It's also really gross in many parts; I'd rather NOT know where gold comes from, thank you...This reminded me of ""Liztomania"" by Ken Russell, if you're in the mood it's a great ""trip,"" if not, it'll give you a major head-ache. It's equal parts Russell/Fellini/Bunuel and John Waters. Santa Sangre was more coherent and good prints are easy to find, but neither it nor El Topo are as spectacular or goofy as this journey into the excessive imagination of a truly unhinged director. I'm glad movies like this exist, even if only in bad prints.",The Holy Mountain

That's what I did and look at me - I'm happy.This movie is made with a particular eye for cinematography; juxtaposition, symbolism and geometric set design create a rather abstract black comedy/fantasy film that hangs together stylistically, even if having no traditional plot elements.The film focuses on a single, relatable theme: a mystic or 'divine teacher' is taking a group on a mission to the Holy Mountain, and through the process they leave the mechanistic, predatory world of social evils, mass produced goods and the hysteria and negativity of our constructed ""real"" societies - to find enlightenment.Cleverly, the film doesn't suggest that there is a real form of spiritual enlightenment through mystical dogma or obscure, ancient ""beliefs"", but encourages the audience to think about the importance of withdrawing from the artificiality of our day-to-day world in favour of finding ""the real"".The film is legendarily odd in its treatment of satire, sexuality and the directors predilection for filming exotic animals.Far better than its rather minor reputation, I recommend seeing Holy Mountain, preferably on a large projector screen or at a theater viewing.",The Holy Mountain

From religion to politics his films capture high volumes of both topics in a very stylish, brutal form. What these films capture on the budget presented is noteworthy, the sets are incredible, the animals used, the freaks, everything plays into the surreal, third eye storm that blows up in your face. It's one of the most conversational movies ever, it forces all of us to think of the implications of the institutions that have been erected, love, hate, all that jazz.

What I felt was conflicting emotions about greed, changing oneself and individuality. Just by that merit alone, this film does what other films can't. Portraying visually what life holds more effectively than a lot of films that use dialogue. This movies creativity is off the charts and I wouldn't think of some of this imagery in a million years. Alejandro Jodorowsky constantly throws every piece of symbolism he can think of. He doesn't care if you drown in it, he would rather you see all of his vision rather than only a fraction of it. A part of me wants to point out that the film has tone issues, gets really grating at times and kinda drags. But I know I will never get the experience of watching anything like this again.

The ending is the main thing that totally blows you away. This film is not crap. It is a significant piece of cinematic art.  Most prints are duplicates of the Japanese laserdisc (widescreen with the nudity fogged out and Japanese subtitles). Most people who have seen this movie ARE, in fact, intellectuals.

An alchemist leads 9 people, representing 9 planets in the universe, on a spiritual journey to the Holy Mountain to conquer immortality. Alejandro Jodorowsky drills his surrealistic skill to mock lost mankind and their sinister religion, politics, industrialization, modernization through mystical symbols and sexual imageries. Inner part of the tower, toads' play, giant sex toy, Christ idols factory, ultramodern weapons, in fact the whole setting----an outstanding vision from the director. Every shot depicts a satirical explosion to shiver our mind.

60,gbx06,The religion of the absurd,7,22 June 2008,"Before viewing this Jodoroswy's film I had heard an endless number of adjectives describing it, in one way or another, the many characteristics of it. Far from being a subversive, anti-religious, spiritual or incomprehensible movie, the Chilean director decided to make a mockery of what we consider religion, of the beliefs that every human being has and the defects of cling to an absolute truth, that far from being unattainable, becomes unusable in the hands of people who are not ready to understand it, and much worse, the search becomes an obstacle to the significance of being, to the real meaning of life: happiness.So the film brings together a group of people representing the planets of the solar system and introduces us to the world of each, allegorical representation of the concerns and attitudes of modern man, to embark on a journey to the holy mountain in the company of master and the son of God made man with the unique result: to reach the only truth. This is where Jodorowsky masterfully gives an excellent conclusion: all religions are true until respect the mind and thoughts and the absolute truth is impossible to achieve, just enough to live.Despite all the analogies and symbolism that manages the film, the mistake of the actor-director-writer is desired to cover too many topics so this make baroque the film and convert it into something indecipherable or nonsense, devoid of symbolic value, Is there when one, as a spectator, feels tired for everything that has seen and that amount of useless information is which makes people miss the true value of the proposal.Still is an excellent film that breaks with the canons of cinema in all its facets, just, as said Jodorowsky just to finish the story, take this as a mere fiction, for what it is: a movie.",The Holy Mountain

But kinda sickening,9,1 March 2016,"The impression this movie made on me was like how I feel about Donald Trump: masterful propaganda that is bona fide genius in some ways, but at the same time gives me this uneasy feeling that it's really not all it's cracked up to be.A lot of glowing things people say about this movie are totally true. This movie has the MOST amazing visuals I have ever seen, and they were all done only using props and locations -- no CGI. Not even any particularly sophisticated practical effects like in a billion-dollar Guillermo Del Toro flick.And the ""symbolism"" very often does seem to point to interesting hidden truths. For instance, the protagonist resembles Jesus, but he is shown passed out and soaked in his own urine. Is Jodorowski encouraging us to have as much compassion for our debauched and unworthy selves as Jesus? Is his use of deformed actors a clever allegory for how we relate to aspects of ourselves which we consider inferior or unworthy? There's a lot of these sweet little rabbit-hole invitations throughout this movie. But then this profoundly allegorical vision-fest throws a whole lot of disgusting images and themes at me that don't exalt or provoke thought, they just repel. An army of people holding up skinned and crucified dogs? WTF does that have to do with anything? An old man giving his prosthetic eye to a pre-pubescent prostitute? A titan of industry who makes decisions based on whether the mannequin of his dead wife's pussy is wet or not? Oh yeah, and how seven of the world's most powerful and evil people are treated to a guided path to enlightenment rather than being punished. What's this supposed to mean?

Carmelo, we find Jorodowsky climbing the towers of Satelite, the shrine of suburban mexican middle class! I found it a great idea that, hidden in those towers, there is a gate to nirvana (the characters are hairless, for they have given up their selves).The first scenes (the conquest of Mexico with frogs and lizards, in the middle of the Basilica de Guadalupe) are great; the ending gives some enlightment. In the middle, you get the usual Jodorowsky salad dressing: freaks, blood, meaningless words, put there to make you feel you're watching something sooo bizarre and sooo special you are, alas, a ""chosen"" person.P.S.

71,a05102267,Turning excrement into gold,9,22 July 2008,"""The Holy Mountain"", the third film of Alejandro Jodorowsky after his controversial cult-film ""El Topo"", is probably his most polished and interesting work. Basically it combines surrealism, satire, and religious and sacrilege imagery to create a bizarre tale of a group of eccentric characters in their search to reach the immortality. Just like ""El Topo"" the characters have no deep, they are mere symbols to serve the purpose of the story, a story that could be find by some people as pretentious or too strange, but the direction of Jodorowsky made this film something original and unique. There are several elements of satire of modern society, that work very well to introduce us the characters of the story (each symbolizing a planet) their way to reach their goal until a surprising ending (I won't reveal it, but I want to mention that the ending is one of the best that I've seen in a movie, working very well with overall tone of the movie) ""The Holy Mountain"" is a unique film. It was ahead of his time and it is the best work of his director.",The Holy Mountain
72,Robert_90,I'll be damned,8,10 April 2008,"A few months ago, I finally got to see El Topo, Jodorowsky's legendary western-on-acid. Quite simply, it blew me away. It was just so strange, so weird, so utterly crazy...I don't know, seeing El Topo on one viewing doesn't mean you'll be able to comprehend it well enough to describe it properly. I'll give it a second view some other time.Anyway....why I mentioned El Topo was because it raised the bar for what I could expect from The Holy Mountain, which promised to be even more of a mind-bending surrealist work than El Topo. For this is how, on the basis of a single viewing, I was prepared to judge The Holy Mountain - on just how bizarre it would get.This may sound a little shallow, but The Holy Mountain is one of those films that requires several viewings to properly comprehend pretty much everything that goes on. On one viewing, all you can do is try and keep your eyes on screen and try to take in as much of the film as possible. Even if you don't fully understand what's going on, take in the experience. That's what I did when I watched The Holy Mountain.The Holy Mountain begins by following a man who's best described as Christlike as he engages in his own journey from dying in the desert to a tall tower, where he meets a mysterious figure known as the Alchemist. The Alchemist recruits the man for his own plan, which involves bringing together several ""thieves"" from around the world so that they can embark on a quest for immortality atop the eponymous mountain.All this is a loose framework for Jodorowsky's trademark elaborate set-pieces - they're big and they're utterly loony. I don't think I'll bother spoiling any of them, but take any scene from the movie and it'll likely have a large, weird-looking set and at least one or two freaky-looking people drawing your attention. One thing that kept preying on my mind the whole time was just how unbelievable the whole idea of The Holy Mountain was. Like El Topo, it was an epic without a wider appeal, and that jarred me for some reason. It just keeps getting stranger and stranger until the end, which I will have to say was utterly unpredictable.The Holy Mountain is truly one-of-a-kind. It'd be pretty easy to say this film isn't for everyone, but it isn't. If you're into movies that don't make sense on the first time (or even the 10th time), I'd recommend this. Or if you're just looking for one intense filmic experience, it doesn't get much more intense than the imagery of The Holy Mountain.I'll end this review now - I've run out of synonyms for crazy.8/10 - this is after one viewing, it'll probably go up after about 7.",The Holy Mountain

74,nbutcher-69458,A visual orgy of art and artistic filmmaking,10,22 March 2018,"Alejandro Jodorowsky's ""The Holy Mountain"" is to film what Captain Beefheart's ""Trout Mask Replica"" is to music. Completely brilliant, completely insane, completely surreal works of creative art. When people with vision are left to their own devices to do whatever they damn well please, the result is something that is so completely transgressive to established norms of filmmaking, that you are forced to take notice and experience it - at least once. It also makes the film really hard to review. People will either love it, or despise it. I fall in the former category.The Holy Mountain has something of a plot - but what you see on screen is so abstract, so absurd, so hilarious, so disgusting and weird, and yet so full of things to say, the plot doesn't really matter all that much. The viewer is bombarded by a series of images that will smash your sensibilities and emotions all over the map. Like any good piece of art, it will present you with words and pictures, but it will not tell you how to make sense out of any of them - if there even is any sense to them. That exercise is left up to the viewer, and you will be challenged every step of the way up to the top of the Holy Mountain.What is for certain though is that Alejandro will smash all your grand illusions by the end of the film.As others have said, nothing can prepare you for this film.",The Holy Mountain

76,Grethiwha,The Ultimate Cult Film,9,14 September 2020,"The Holy Mountain sometimes feels like it's from another world or timeline. It feels like a big Hollywood movie, only if the dominant film culture wasn't Hollywood, but somewhere very foreign. Maybe a culture from a different time period - if ancient people made films in technicolor cinemascope. At least until it becomes a satire of modern western culture. The scenes in the tower are especially dazzling. In whatever world this came from, this movie is as big as Star Wars.At the same time, what it really is, is just the ultimate cult film, for aficionados of nonsensical gonzo absurdity. There are a lot of crazy cult films. What I mean by 'ultimate' is, this film literally never goes 30 seconds, without being genuinely astonishing. Howard Hawks once said that a great movie has three good scenes, and no bad ones. The Holy Mountain has only insane scenes.By way of example, there's a brief scene illustrating a drug that ""turns harmless people into wild beasts"": An armless dwarf wearing a crested steel helmet and a diaper and nothing else repeatedly kicks a toppled stone mannequin while making a steady constant screaming noise, for about 20 seconds straight. This is a truly astonishing scene: What are the chances of finding someone who is both armless, and a dwarf? I would imagine it is statistically impossible. Yet, this may not even phase you, given the relentless pace at which this film bombards you with such marvels.Most films follow some kind of formula. Boy meets girl. Boy falls in love. Boy loses girl. Etcetera. This movie is a bit different. Boy wakes up in desert, with his face covered in flies, pissing himself. Boy goes into town and acts like a chicken while the conquest of Mexico is being reenacted by small costumed reptiles. Boy is knocked out by fat Spartans and used to cast a statue of Jesus. Boy wakes up in a room full of papier-mâché Jesuses, freaks out, and destroys them all with his bare hands... And so on in that manner.The film is full of religious imagery, tarot, mysticism and other confounding symbolism none of which I frankly understand. I don't think it matters. A lot of it is satirical, and I understand that much. The rest basically falls into the realm of the sublime, where the film is understood through feeling and intuition rather than intellect. I think a lot of the best films are like that; they have more in common with music and painting than literature. The Holy Mountain is also very funny, though rarely in a laugh-out-loud way.It isn't my favourite Alejandro Jodorowsky film. That would be his 2013 comeback film The Dance of Reality. That film marries his shock aesthetics and boundless originality to a personal and touching script with some genuine profundity; a dimension that's absent from this film. It also features the important disclaimer: no animals were harmed in the making of this movie. As in El Topo, there is some animal cruelty in The Holy Mountain, and I have to hold that against it. Harming real animals for a movie is always a bad choice, not only morally, but artistically, as it pulls me right out of the film, breaking the hard-won spell that the film had worked to achieve.That said, I personally don't find anything in The Holy Mountain too hard to stomach. And I have to give credit to Jodorowsky, who not only wrote and directed the movie, but produced, edited, starred in it, and composed the soundtrack too. It's one of the most singular and visionary films of the 70s, and one of the grandest cult films ever made. I might even be understating things. It would probably be on my shortlist of films that I'd select for inclusion in some kind of time or space capsule, à la Voyager Golden Record, along with probably Koyaanisqatsi and something like Star Wars, if I was trying to distill human and film culture down to a handful of movies, for some future alien civilization to puzzle over.

80,jkhuysmans0,Getting High with Jesus On Earth,10,12 March 2008,"And exploring foreign policy with Eva Peron on Saturn. Actually, Holy Mountain (1973), despite common perceptions (yet it is undeniable that many filmmakers from around the time this film was constructed, apart form actor Cary Grant, perhaps Jodorowsky even, might have affirmed that Lysergic Acid Diethylamide was in fact the key to the locked vice that is the universe) is not a drug film. It's quite a shame, actually, that this kind of film-making that Jodorowsky was after is evidently a thing of the past. I don't know, maybe it's the Iraq War, but I think the modern viewer better relates with Jodorowsky's other substantially more unified piece of art, a sort of Spaghetti Western of a nightmare-breakdown, El Topo (1970), the director's other famous picture released not more than three years prior to Holy Mountain.Unlike El Topo, Holy Mountain has a tendency to shift gears much more rapidly and displays an openness (not necessarily in the spacial sense) to become something completely different at any given moment. At the start of the film, we're reminded much of Fellini's Amarcord (1973) with a little Satyricon (1969) mixed in. Then we're moved on to Satanic Ritual and visuals not unlike those found in the later films of Kenneth Anger. Mid-movie, the director starts to essay on industrialism and the factory-produced characteristics of modern art which of course is bought and sold but you know that.Every great art film director, particularly great European art film directors (Jodorowsky, while Latin American, lives in France) from the late sixties and early seventies wanted to make movies like Federico Fellini, however very few of them did. Antonioni sort of went there in that carnival direction at the beginning and end of Blow-Up (1966) however; he never took it as far as Jodorowsky advances the Fellini stylistics of cinema in Holy Mountain. Dusan Makavejev's Sweet Movie (1974) accomplishes something similar to Holy Mountain, potentially quite a bit better, but, in my mind, the jury is still out. I recommend viewing the two films in sequence or, who knows, maybe it is just better if you watch them both at the same time.If you're a bored cinephile, looking for new images, heretofore unseen images, and you haven't checked this one out yet, now might be the time. The new Anchor Bay DVD reproduction of the Techniscopic process is super clean. Once great aspect to film material is that it just gets better with time. But getting down with Holy Mountain, you must remember, with a piece like that: the confrontation-tension exists not up there on the screen between the ""characters"" but rather between the mystical light-specter, The Holy Mountain and YOU. So dig in and, ""Zoom back camera!""",The Holy Mountain

82,daretostruggledaretowin,We Really Need to talk about the Holy Mountain,10,18 April 2016,"Let me just say, although I was not all that impressed by El Topo(I tended to enjoy Fando y Lisa little more), I'm glad John Lennon and Yoko Ono went to see it at a midnight showing. They convinced the Beatles' manager, Alen Klein, to bankroll Jodorowsky's next film, what some would call his most self- indulgent (and consequently most brilliant) the Holy Mountain.Does the film live up to the budget? Let's put it this way, Jodorowsky never made a better film since, even though his concept for Dune would have been brilliant. The Dance of Reality was a pretentious jab at communist discipline and any non-religious approachHowever, the Holy Mountain has always stuck with me as one of the most brilliant films of all of cinema history. I can't help, even as an atheist, feeling shame a being mocked by Jodorowsky's psycho-magic in the documentary about him, Consellation. He, the director who forced his actors to take Psilocybin mushrooms during the ""hump the mountain"" scene. He who, at the end of the film assures that all we have just seen was a film and not actual reality. He who can read your fortune in the tarot deck.I understand why some might be taken in by cults and cult films are called that for a reason. They offer the perfect escape from just the wrong situation. The Holy Mountain is one of those films. And it was genuinely, Babylonianally hedonistic and subversive. You can enter a world where it doesn't matter if you mutilate animals or make bombs into toys. The journey is the same. You might be Jesus of Muhammad, but you're still just in Olympic competition with Zeus and Aphrodite at the Pantheon Bar and it's Karaoke night. A drunk guy can go across the mountain, but he can't ascend because he can only travel horizontally.I love you and I'd like you to know, this film has not always or even often done right by me. As a matter of fact, strict, fundamental adherence to this film could result in some dangerous fundamentalism. Of course Jodorowsky free's you from all that at the end when he declares the whole previous hour and a half simulacrum of reality a film. Just watch it already.this review originally appeared at http://paranoidcinephilia.blogspot.com/",The Holy Mountain
83,ttetpos,"Brilliant! ""Seek and ye shall...""",10,12 January 2014,"I experienced more raw, refined and direct emotions with my entire being watching ""The Holy Mountain"" than I did by watching many hundreds of other movies... my entire organism participated in this experience: my body, heart, mind, plus whatever other faculties may lie beyond their realms.It's a great movie for Seekers of all levels, all Paths, all orientations, faiths and disciplines.Something about ""The Holy Mountain"" reminded me of the movie titled ""Eraserhead"" (1977); perhaps the level of successfully utilized bizarre imagery. But ""The Holy Mountain"" does not exploit the bizarre for the benefit of the bizarre alone, nor does it feature the bizarre just for feeding and fueling the Spectacle. There's complex feelings and teachings within every visual detail of the compositions, and within every twist and turn of the plot.Something about ""The Holy Mountain"" reminded me of the movie titled ""Circle of Iron"" (1978); it also is a story of Seeking, of being on the Path for spiritual self-realization; transcendence... but ""The Holy Mountain"" definitely goes deeper, and addresses the Seeker~Viewer from multiple, well-informed points of departure all at once.I found the music wonderful. I found the voices of the characters... superb, matching a genuine presence they conveyed that most modern actors today have a hard time rendering. In this respect the movie matches many movies of the counter-culture and the underground created during the revolutionary of the sixties-seventies. Most of the people in ""The Holy Mountain"" are so real that it's hard to distinguish if they are just regular people pretending to be actors, or actors so deeply aware, so brimming with artful dexterity that they appear to be just regular people. Echoes here of ""Zabriskie Point"" (1970), in the sense of having actors who are totally real - so real, that the movie might as well be a staged documentary. ""Obscured by Clouds / The Valley"" (1972) also comes to mind easily because of this quality (and for the them, a journey of discovery and Seeking): and for those who were disappointed that ""The Valley"" did not show enough naked flesh, there's plenty of honest nudity it in ""The Holy Mountain"": probably more than most viewers can handle.The photography is very high quality, and so is the editing. To be honest, I wanted the movie to be longer. And as soon as it ended I wanted to watch it again!",The Holy Mountain
84,hasanmahbub1981,A movie which deals with a lot of thing and never been detached.,10,3 September 2012,"Well. what can I say about this movie? Good is not enough.Bizarre, weird, surreal, anti religious, anti capitalistic, anti communist, anti materialistic, surreal, sick, cute, sarcastic. Every single shot means a lot. This movie rules. This is so special. And most of all, it sings the song of humanity and hope and love. If you like to watch some bizarre images, okay go on, you will not be able to get the movie, but you will like that for sure. If you want to understand this movie, and give this movie a proper view you will be amused with so many surreal and symbolic shots. You will get so many messages. The good thing is, there is enough space for you to think these things in your own way. I can differ with you about some things, but there is no absolute theory. This is the beauty of viewing multiplicity of this movie. The movie Starts with a Christ like man with a creep stranger. The journey starts. And revolve around the world and universe in search of immorality. In this journey, they collect people from different planets. The world is like a glass, and through their eyes, everything is so naked. What a sarcastic view! At the end, did they were able to get what they wanted? Actually, the question is id they need hat they want? The holy mountain is a mind provoking movie. Strongly recommended for every mature people.",The Holy Mountain

88,jstreitfeld,One of a Kind,10,4 September 2005,"There's no other film like this. It is in a league of its own, standing out even apart from Jodorowsky's other films. It is a masterpiece. Many people may not be able to sit through this, since it has a rather abstract and philosophical narrative structure, and very little dialogue. However, I think everybody should see it. It has some very interesting and important things to say about religion and society. Not only that, but it is without a doubt the most visually stunning film I've ever seen. There are so many uniquely beautiful and thought-provoking images in this film--enough to fill a book. I'd buy that book, actually, if it existed. It's really quite a shame that there isn't a restored version of this film available on DVD. This should be required viewing for anyone interested in religion, film or art in general.",The Holy Mountain
89,vorlac,Holly Jodorowsky,8,7 January 2018,"Alexandro jodorowsky, we can do a cinematograph world analysis. a world of moviegoers seeking a new name without stopping, a new name that others do not know. we have to ignore some deficiencies in order to bring up the name that others do not know. we must find the seijun suzuki without ending the mizoguchi, kurosawa. or we should consume 60s of Japanese erotic cinema. ozu, mizoguchi and kurosawa have not been consumed. I am also pleased to have discovered suzuki by means of this mind-blowing fashion designer. but it's always the same: this is the undiscovered ore director, suddenly japanese cinema, korean cinema, and so on, a must-have, mediator iftar, great master. ok suzuki's psychedelic cinema is so much fun, it's impossible to approach a mediocre kurosawa movie. suzuki does not have good movies, has interesting films.a jodorowsky who became a drug sponge in the 1960s and '70s is likewise introduced as the antithesis of the name, ""wow how you do not know, one of the most important directors of the world"". I do not know ... I did not know ... I did not know the valhalla ... now the person who introduced me to the holy mountain is infinite and I'm very happy to watch the movie, I bought a lot. but everything is a native rather than a seat.an interesting film at the outset, not a good movie, the holy mountain. ha is a very interesting movie apart from it. From a visual point of view, Jodorowsky hits the top of the LSD he gets. The exciting fiction of some of the scenes is awesome. we are laughing somewhere, we are staring at arts management, camera management, mizansene admiration. ultimately it's worth the effort we've made to reach a Jodorowsky movie. we do not regret it.but a good movie the holy mountain? If you are not a Catholic, cheap metaphors that ""place"" the Jodorowsky's Catholic Church are not in the mood for a ""no more interesting things"". interesting things, model weapon factory, shudder, again the same cheap sensation, must be provoking in the account, but to its own provocation, to ""fuck you"", to the distance (unnecessarily, because it must be extremely conventional) but at least it's visual. it is not possible to see that the process of modeling, the way in which every image looks like, affects greenaway, and especially wes anderson. but when GreenAway and Anderson are complete artists, their films are ""artifacts"" for the whole, while Jodorowsky stays with the qualities that influence those films. the rest is a world view of hippie bullshit, let's become one with nature, turn into the superior man. the problem is not what you are saying, but the naan that overwhelms the person you are talking about, the uncertainty of your innocence in the cheapness, the knowledge of the whole world ... or the interview in the Filmin DVD is ""sensational, unseen!"" It was a terrific surprise last time in the form of lanterns. So we are destroying the illusion. What are you doing to create the illusion? We did not buy lsd, we are aware, we are not in a bad movie, illusion. it is not unseen, thank God we saw it.it is unlikely that you will end up with these highly effective Catholic films, if you have not taken any drugs. good sides, which are super interesting good things, if I put them aside, my message is shudder: there are very few people who are really good and rediscovered. terrence malick maybe, after the thin red line. or is already discovered a film of an unknown value of a good director; like after hours. please do not change your world with the excitement of discovering jodorowsky. but you can not change the whole cinema history with a director.

This film has many religous refrences but ill be damned if i no what religion. There are many surreal moments in the holy mountain that make no sense they leave you with a blank expression on your face and you dont really no what to think. Here is an example of three such moments. 1. A old man is found under a big cloth on a mountain he has breasts. Then suddenly each breast turns into cheeta head and sprays milk. 2. A huge toilet with a fat naked woman on it and beside her a man in bed with a horse. 3.

I have studied film theory and mass media and found this film to provide interesting perspectives along obscenity. The main message here, is a critique against the commercialism of commodities in every land and society. Every commodity is possible to make profit from; sex, drugs, lifestyle, economics to warfare including religious artefact's. Somehow it gives you some sort of better insight upon complex matters that are as suitable to our modern world. It's a crazy, drugged-up ride with genuine characters nicely played by to me unknown actors.

94,lhnrlmitz,"Look beyond Jowdorosky's craziness, and comprehend his intellect.",10,4 April 2012,"I had watched ""The Holy mountain"" a few years back and I've forgotten why and how I came across this film, for the ""why"" i meant, ""The Holy Mountain"" was made 20 years before I was born, and there, really wasn't any reason for me to watch it except for my boredom. But I am glad to have watched it, for it exposed me to the insight of art, ""The Holy Mountain"" became a definition of ""Art"" for me, and besides being ""the"" definition of ""art"" for me; ""The Holy Mountain"" had me questioning on the modern perception of ""sanity"", I used to have, and in fact many people still defines ""insanity"" if the action a person action or the thinking that person has, that does not relate to us or compromise with society, as an act of ""insanity""; To think of it , even in retrospect , people have been defining ""insanity"", aforementioned. The definition of ""sanity"" should refer to a rationality of an individual; After watching ""The Holy Mountain"", I find the conclusion to the story, rational; The journey until the conclusion, surreal. The film and its imagery still lingers on my mind on a regular basis. You will need some exposure to Christianity in order to understand the surface of the story, and anything beyond that, is up to your interpretation - my summary will consists of minor spoilers and some of my own interpretation; For the first 20mins , there is no dialogue, Jowdorosky bring us to a tour, a tour showcasing human's ""insanity"". During the tour, a scene with soldiers and man dancing in each other arm, struck me with a thought, is ""insanity"" conditional? Is it okay for people to be irrational for the sake of finding peace and sanity amidst chaos and insanity? After the tour , the main character(The Thief) a Christ-like figure, ventures into the surreal realm of the Alchemist. The Thief deemed the Alchemist as an adversary and attacks him, The Alchemist exhibits his powers and remove an alien substance that was seemingly the cause of The Thief's violent nature; The Alchemist then says to The Thief: ""Do you want gold?"" and The Thief replied ""Yes"", The Alchemist then made The Thief defecate into a container - Yes , you will watch him literally shitting, naked.The Alchemist then had The Thief go through a hellish process, sweat and tears are flowing out from The Thief, in order to transform the excrement into gold, an idiom for ""working"", maybe? and he said to the Thief: ""You are excrement. You can change yourself into gold."" . The quote made sense to me, humans sort of is, an excrement and we're working hard to turn into something worthy. The Thief is then introduced to 7 powerful humans who will accompany The Thief on his journey, and each of their introduction conveys an emphasised sin, personifying Christianity 7 deadly sins. The Thief, The Alchemist and the 7 sins then embarks on their journey to The Holy Mountain to obtain immortality,and will they attain immortality? Not spoiling it for you. I believe that Jowdorosky's conclusion to the film, is an important underlying message, but revealing that message will spoil the essence of the film, I'm not spoiling it, so watch it yourself!I recommend this film to people who likes surreal imagery, because every frame is wallpaper worthy; people who have an open sense of humor, because religion mockery is always funny; and lastly, people who are bored out of their mind.",The Holy Mountain
95,CommeVousNousEtions,A boring art house film delivering the wrong message,1,9 March 2014,"What can you say about such a film? Some liken it to art, but as another reviewer said all film is art so that is not an appropriate justification. There is good and bad art and you'll have to do better than you just don't 'get' it. I hate when people have to justify that they 'got' a film before criticizing it.This film is on the most tasteless level of film making. I think people have fooled themselves into liking it. I almost did, I really had to think about the rating I would give this for a while. In the end I based my decision on the emotional impact, nil, and the amount of depraved muck I had to watch to 'get' the satire, the satire being the redeeming factor of the film for me until I realised that it wasn't satire at all. It was glorification of debauchery. In films that satire a particular group such as the politicians in Dr. Strangelove we see them as inept fools and know exactly the people in real life they reference. At no point do any of the nine depraved rich come across as fools or can they be referenced to a particular person in reality. Only the Jesus character comes across as a fool. The other fools portrayed in the film are actually the normal people, i.e. you and me, who buy into the nine's images and marketing strategies. The audience. And that sickens me to the core. That he mocks the people of the world while at the same time the film is lauded by those same people buying into it's 'image' even when it is so obviously gross and depraved.So the evil rich at the end gain enlightenment or truth, while the rest of us wallow in the mire forevermore. A purely evil theme if ever I've seen one and obviously I can't get behind that.I probably went into this film way too open minded first time around, to the point where I had convinced myself I just needed an open mind to enjoy it. I had a chuckle at the art (satire?) scene where asses paint the new 'masterpieces'. But for a two hour film with only one memorable scene, the scene that is probably an allegory for the film that presented it, that's not good enough.My conclusion is that unlike real art from the renaissance period where artists tried to capture the real world as perfectly and beautifully as possible, the same can be said of poetry trying to capture emotion or books trying to create fantastic adventures etc, this would be art, however, the advent of 'modern' artists in both the painting world and the cinema world has left an ongoing legacy of pure muck on canvas and film reels parading as art, this film achieves nothing artistically, it is not moving and emotional, it is not epic, it is not beautiful, it's not even entertaining for most of it, it's just a shock to the system for most people and fear of calling down the wrath of the critics or for being called out for not 'getting' it people laud its brilliance. This sort of 'art' is forced and is clearly not made to inspire and invigorate the soul and for all these reasons I'm out.Even if this was art, what can we compare it with in our own experience to say that it is beautiful, there is no reference point in reality for something like this, not like a symphony stirring up emotions, or the awe of amazing landscape or portrait paintings or an uplifting or sombre story. This has none of the above, If this is solely an intellectual film, then I say to all these pseudo intellectuals to go out and get a PHD in physics or something and stop convincing us of your great intellect by saying you 'get' this utter nonsense.",The Holy Mountain

The repetition, the color, the sheer beauty, really is unparalleled. The way Jodorowsky uses music I feel can't be compared to any other director. The way he uses tribal drumming and chanting to set a mood has your heart race in a way that builds suspense and keeps you on edge similarly to electronic music of present day.

It is like Fantasia on a very bad trip, without the beautiful music but with tons of creative imagery.It goes from simply strange to disturbingly revolting back to bizarrely funny and hypnotizingly symbolic. And after that, it does all those things at once. You need a VERY open mind or you won't even begin to feel anything remotely positive towards Jodorowskis piece of art. And art it is.There once was this German comedian who performed in front of some art critics. He sang a very simplistic song about a wolf and a lamb. Than he screamed the word Hurz. And continued singing. That's not art in its common understanding. Hurz doesn't mean anything. It implies a deeper meaning where there is no meaning at all. It distracts from the real intention of the artist.What is the real intention? To fool the audience.This movie is 109 minutes of Hurz. You can over-interpret the symbolism and search for a meaning until your brain hurts. But you will never know the directors intention, because there is no way to tell what is earnest commentary on society, religion or similar important matter and what's just complete and utter nonsense.You think, you found the meaning?

The director decided to include many eastern religious symbols into the movie to try and make it more meaningful, but the symbols don't really make sense in the way they are portrayed, and it seems like the director just read the cliff notes of Hindu and Buddhist religions and tried to portray them for pedantic means (the symbolic metaphors of western religion are extremely obvious though). The movie, barring a few religious mix ups, is still extremely good, and I gave it a nine out of ten stars for a good reason. The imagery and characters, are whimsical, sometimes seeming like they are straight out of a dream. Unfortuneatly this dream doesn't take into account that animal cruelty is somewhat of a taboo these days, and several scenes are almost unwatchable because of this. Still the movie is great, and should be enjoyed, preferably wasted and with friends that have enough guts to sit through it with you.

104,bjbeamish,Russ Meyer on LSD,1,23 November 2006,"This has to be one of the most disappointing films ever made. The beginning promises well with some low-grade Bunuel rip-offs, but quickly descends into exploitative pseudo-meaningful porn with some deliberately sensationalist sequences that undermine the quality of the stream of random set-pieces with which it begins.The film takes a massive downturn when the director cops out and introduces speech, which makes it appear that he has run out of ideas and cannot sustain the momentum. The dialogue that ensues is pretentious and insubstantial, which makes it appear as though the director is so unhappy with having had to introduce a narrative that he has attempted to mask the comparatively tedious action with it.This film is definitely of its time and indebted to the 60s notion of free love that in actual fact meant free love for men who exploited women in the process. The imagery towards the end of the film becomes repetitious and most of the acting is appallingly bad and at times laughable.

I can accept that this film may not be for everyone. But whilst this may be biased, it is moronic for those who CAN withhold the imagery to simply write it off before making the credits. Whilst there is debate on significance of symbolism and the like within the film, I feel that people who participate in such thoughts may be missing the moral of the story. The fact that Jodorowsky went to such an extent only furthers the message delivered at the end. (Which is what the whole film is built upon) I'd say its defintley worth some replay value, as they may have been some elements I missed on the first or second encounter with it. Moving on to watch other works of Jodorowsky, I'd say that this is easily the best.

107,ryan_hartig,An Artist Honest Review,1,4 October 2010,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life, and is the perfect itemized list of everything wrong with ""ART"" Films. I'm an Artist, I studied painting at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. While i was there i had (was forced) to watch this film 3 times and not only can I say how much I disliked it but I'll tell you from the Bottom of my heart that this is the symbol of everything thats wrong with Modern Art.As an Artist I made 1 very important rule that I'll live by for the rest of my life. Never EVER make art for Artists. Anyone of you other reviewers who gave this a great review, let me ask you. If i were to take the movie and play it for random people on the street of downtown Chicago, New York, LA, do you think the majority will like this film? how about understand this film? will it change their lives? will it inspire them? will it give any idea what so ever in their heads besides ""what's the quickest way to run away from this garbage""????I Guarantee, GUARANTEE!!! they won't. They'll be asking Who, What, When, Why, and How so much that it really defeats the whole purpose of ""Visual Communication"" doesn't itThat is the key here, ""Visual Communication"".... This film communicates to people the same way a stereotype homeless crazy person does. So if you understood it, you'd have to be crazy or delusional. Don't dare say its an Artist thing either, I'm an Artist and I've seen it 3 times and still don't understand it. In fact all it did was fuel my hate for this movie. Art is a powerful thing that shouldn't be used to describe a film that makes no sense to a common-minded individual.All films ARE in fact ART. and using Art as the only description for any movie should be the word of warning of how ass it will be, and the director should be labeled as a total pretentious prick from now till the end of time, space, and matter.I'd sooner recommend castration than watching this movie for any normal human and I'm Dead serious. If you want to know how not to make a movie I'll save you the trouble of watching this movie. JUST MAKE SENSE TO A NORMAL FREAKING PERSON YOU JACKASS",The Holy Mountain
108,dagiarrat,Is it possible for an abstract art film to be too on the nose?,7,20 December 2018,"This movie answers the above question firmly in the affirmative. Uh, huh, so the ""Christ"" figure is initially meant to represent the Earth itself and the children represent the naivete of young mankind. Okay, so the ""chameleon and frog circus"" represents the sins of our forebears, and the fact that the ""Aztecs"" are chameleons symbolizes the fact that they could have adapted but were never given the chance. Yes, yes, the ""Romans"" create counterfeit Christs to gull the hoi polloi. Yeah, I get it, the rage of the Christ figure is meant to evoke the rage of Christ in the money-changing synagogue. There are twelve girls who represent the twelve apostles. The chimpanzee represents the doubt of Thomas. The golden hook represents faith, and the rise of the Christ figure to the hole in the red tower is meant to reflect the apotheosis of Christ. The alchemist is an allegory for god, and the line ""you are excrement"" references the origin of Adam as a clay golem given a soul. The gold represents the Truth that man seeks, which exists in all of us, but can only be revealed by god.Then there are the other ""gods"". Venus manufactures ""love"". Mars manufactures ""war"". Jupiter manufactures ""wisdom"". Saturn manufactures ""faith"". Uranus manufactures ""success"". Neptune manufactures ""order"". Pluto manufactures ""comfort"" and ""rest"". All of them are already gods of Mount Olympus, conscripted in the ""Christ's"" mission to find the god that is already a part of himself.Venus (Fon) is a perversion of love, reflecting how Jodorowsky sees love as cheapened and commercialized. Mars (Isla) represents the commodification of war and violence. Jupiter (Klen) represents the commercialization of art, of personal expression, and the loss of true wisdom to avarice and lust. Uranus (Berg) represents the heartless and thoughtless exercise of power given only through birth, as he is the son and husband of Gaia (I do have to applaud Jodorowsky for his thorough exploration of just how repulsive such a relationship as that of Uranus and Gaia from Greek mythology would be in real life). Neptune (Axon) robs his acolytes of their wills (quite literally by ritualistically castrating them), so bending them to his will and his concept of law and order. Pluto (Lut) gives rest to ""the dead"", the average people who are unaware and unconcerned.The green fluid represents ""the Truth"". The chimpanzee and ""Thomas"" both drink it eagerly, while it is bitter and unpleasant to the ""Greek gods"". The ""gods"" are cut with a spear head on their right sides, and press fruits of the valley into them; more Christian imagery about doubt and about Doubting Thomas specifically.The Enneagram makes a regular appearance, and its symbolism of the human psyche suggests that the nine pilgrims (The Thief, The Alchemist, The Written Woman, Fon, Isla, Klen, Berg, Axon, and Lut) represent different aspects of the human psyche, all of them taking a journey in the third act to unify and thus obtain enlightenment.I could go on, but you get the idea, reader. This film is pregnant with symbolism, but-and maybe this is just because I, personally, am very familiar with the literary, religious, occult, and historical references within-it's all so unsubtle, and this makes the experience somewhat tedious. To be sure, there were moments during which I caught myself truly enjoying the film, but these were fleeting and marred by an uncontrollable urge to roll my eyes. This may have been ground-breaking and profound in the 1970's, but it's far too blatant for me. The film held me down, shoving my nose into its symbolism, repeatedly shouting, ""get it?! Get it?! Isn't it so profound?!"" No, Alejandro, it isn't, and you're not as clever as you think you are.Underneath all of the sophomoric pretense is some excellent cinematography, gorgeous set design, beautiful costume design, and dedicated acting. The score is completely appropriate and unique. Any film buff will relish the experience, and this is why my score is as high as it is. Film is not my wheelhouse, but I can recognize the particular challenges of the art and the fact that Jodorowsky effortlessly manipulates most of them. There is true art to this, but it is not to be found in the screenplay or even the plot.Final note: I GET IT, ALREADY!",The Holy Mountain

It was probably the single most enjoyable movie experience I have ever had in my life, and I'm not just talking about the psychedelic experience.

Though this film is underground and seems a generally well-kept secret, it is a one-of-a-kind treasure.This film is a timeless gift, meant to be cherished. I first watched El Topo, which was also amazing. However, I must say that this one was quite a bit more rich, in a visual sense.

110,krnxsowhatx,One of the most interesting movies ever,10,26 July 2009,"This is perhaps one of my most favorite movies ever because before I ever watched this movie I briefly studied religion (my favorite being Hinduism and Buddhism) and as I watched the movie I find some of the most essential religious themes that corresponds with eastern philosophy (and religion) and Judeo-Christian religion. This film is perhaps the most profound film I'd watched, however I find that many would be confused and thus misunderstand the intention and message of the film. The film, I must emphasize, is not a purely arbitrary that results from bad acid trip. There have been moments in the film inspired by psychedelic drugs but this inspiration was used occasionally only as the means to portray and convey the a form of mystical aesthetic. The movie simply did not happen because of indulgent drug use, it was carefully and creatively written and filmed by Alejandro Jodorowsky who happens to be an expert (or at least well learned) in comparative religion and practiced Zen Buddhism and other esoteric practices.And I have to emphasize Alejandro Jodorowsky is not one of those hippies who tries to inspire the hippy movement, that is not his intention and style. Although Alejandro Jodorowsky can easily be labeled as a hippy because of his fascination with drugs, variety of religions, and liberalism Alejandro Jodorowsky did not necessarily make the film to carry out the political agenda that most hippies might have in common with him. Alejandro Jodorowsky's movie is emphasizing through the brief protagonist of the thief of a human person ""thrown"" into the absurd and surreal reality in which his existence is victimized by capitalism, religion, and society. Through out the whole movie the protagonist meets the alchemist and then strives for immortality among all other aspirants. Each of these aspirants reflect the problems of modernity, globalization, and basic human problems. They all strive for immortality in the cost of extreme asceticism to transcend their instinctual and mortal drive. Through out the movie they go through a psychological and spiritual journey of mortification and selflessness. However through their journey they slowly learn to make a distinction between illusion and reality, and in the end when they reached their destination they find themselves humorously disillusioned. There really was no immortality, it was simply an idea they had to strive for. This realization is inspired by zen Buddhism and Hinduism, when the person makes a journey he or she strives for enlightenment, salvation, moksha, or a certain ideal spiritual goal. But once they reach there they find that there really is no ""Enlightenment"", ""Salvation"", ""Moksha"" or any spiritual goal. This emphasizes the journey, but not only does it emphasize the journey but it emphasizes self-realization that there is no attainment but simply knowing who one is. The ""Holy Mountain"" and ""Immortality"" likewise are spiritual goals that the nine mortals tried to strive for but in the end they realize that there is no ""immortality"" to begin with, the real purpose of the journey is to help them find reality not immortality. It is to help them know who they are. The Buddhist make a similar illustration in which the journey men takes a raft from his village through a river bank to reach his destination. But when he reached his destination and looks back, he doesn't see the destination but the whole reality which he went through. He no longer sees his village, his destination, his river banks, and his raft, he sees the big picture that pales his experience in comparison. For me the theme of the film makes it very precious and profound to watch, and it certainly has proved itself unique and different from traditional Hollywood movies. Despite the fact that symbols and events have ambiguous messages this is simply because most of us are not fully well learned in religious symbols, but regardless of that fact I enjoyed the movie.",The Holy Mountain

The movie stars a cast of mostly silent characters who search for something beyond mortality and the ignorance of mankind, only to discover something even greater. This movie has some of the best surrealism I have ever seen in a movie if not the best. However it should be said that surrealism doesn't work just by its own. If it's just random iconography disbanded from a context, It looses all importance and meaning, effectively rendering it to be pretentious screen fodder. This movie however uses its stunning visual effects to convey messages on a level deeper and more complex than blatantly shoving it in your face. It's well used and effective. This movie plays with the themes of war, violence, conditioning, love, art, sex, humanity, fear, sorrow, childhood, and experience. The movie represents different cultures, ideologies, factions, and arts as their own planets to show how alien each is from one another, yet how they all come together to achieve enlightenment. 10/10 movie and a must watch.",The Holy Mountain

A lot of art-house films are too impenetrable for me, and typically the most experimental movies I'm able to get into are Charlie Kaufman's. Jodorowsky is a notable exception.All movies have a finite lifespan, a certain number of times you can watch it before you fail to gain any further value from it: highly commercial movies might only allow 2 watches, whereas a David Fincher film might allow as many as 10. La Montaña Sagrada is singular in that it has immortality. It's value does not diminish over time, does not suffer from issues of rewatchability, and does not disappoint upon revisits. The density of symbolism in this film, a flaw in other art-house movies, is masterfully constructed in a way that is just as profound on your 1st watch as on your 20th.",The Holy Mountain
119,smoshwa-movies,Quite a Trip,8,15 September 2019,"This is a very interesting film that had me not knowing what to think early on and ended up sucking me in as the film went on. This film is certainly not for everyone because it is quite odd at points to say the least. However, it is clear that it was not intended to be fully straight forward and instead was meant to often have a lot of meaning that might be left up to different interpretations. Despite this film being made so long ago, it feels quite applicable to today's world.The film is well directed by Alejandro Jodorowsky, who also acts as one of the main characters. It was clear that each and every scene was very well set up and executed. Although it is not always clear what is being said, what happens always fits in with the world that he has built for this film.There is not much in way of a direct traditional narrative throughout the film (although it does have three parts). Instead, I think that Alejandro is trying to convey various messages to the audience throughout the film. Exactly what he is trying to have us understand is a little more difficult to decipher at times. A couple of the more obvious messages that I recognized were messages that were political, social, and spiritual. I think his overall vision of what he is trying to have us think about in the end, is what the meaning of life is for us.There are a lot of very beautiful shots throughout the film and very mesmerizing ones as well. Its shots are colorful and deliberate. From what I can tell, the film uses only practical effects and uses them very well for the time. There were so many sets in this film that helped shape its world and aided in the film's beauty. The budget for this film could have been astronomical but was somehow not that expensive in comparison to some.The editing for the film was often abrupt which helped to help keep the viewer focused on the important parts and continue the progression of the film. There were so many extras and even just main characters in this film, all of which were good performances for what this film was meant to be. Alejandro Jodorowsky, as the alchemist, and Horacio Salinas, as the thief, were the most prevalent characters and were both very solid performances.The soundtrack meshed very well with the film throughout. Something that I noticed about the sound for the film, was that the characters lips often do not match up with the words they are saying, similar to a music video or a badly dubbed foreign film. The dialogue was very strange in this way. Another similarly nonreal thing I noticed was when a woman was playing a large stringed instrument. It was clear that she was not actually properly playing it, yet it sounded like she was playing it correctly. The audio I think for this reason could all have been done afterwards and not on set during the actual scenes, which added a certain layer of strangeness to fit in with the rest of the film. It was clear though that this was deliberate and worked for what the film was going for (though often I might not have been able to identify what it was going for).The film is trying to showcase itself as a work of abstract art in many ways with all of its different sets and strange events that take place. There was a lot of nudity that was not really sexual and usually seemed to have a purpose but could be distracting or even sometimes off-putting. A good deal of the film also is meant to be absurdly comedic. Someone who watches this may be able to have a spiritual experience, have a great time watching while high (maybe both of those at the same time), or just plain outright despise its existence. For me it ended up being an overall good experience although it had me confused and dumbfounded at times throughout it.",The Holy Mountain
120,jdelamater-01684,The Holy Mountain: Review/Analysis,10,30 November 2016,"The Holy Mountain is a 1973 Mexican-American surrealist fantasy film directed, produced, edited, and co-scored by Alejandro Jodorowsky. The film stars Jodorowsky himself as the Alchemist alongside a dearth of diverse and unique characters. The Alchemist enlightens a lost Christ-like figure known as the thief and leads him along with a group of planet leaders (who are all also thieves) to The Holy Mountain to find a group of immortal wise men. In this film analysis, I will explain how the film represents a reflection of our world and how we use religion, society, vanity, war, and material objects to keep us from achieving true enlightenment. After the opening of the film, we are introduced to the thief. The thief is a representation of the tarot card, the fool. When first created, tarot cards were used exclusively to play games. But after a while, tarot cards were used heavily in religion and spirituality. The Fool's tarot card number is zero. Upright, this means innocence. Upside down, it means foolishness. These two readings of the card embody the characteristics and ideals of the thief. The thief meets a dwarf with no hands or arms. The dwarf represents defeat, another tarot card. The thief embraces defeat, innocence, and foolishness until he is captured by the townsfolk. The town is never explicitly named but the town is a representation of the entire world. In the town, people profit off selling religious beliefs as well as the war economy seen through the death of hundreds of toads. Based on the human urge to consume and indulge, tourists throw money at the depictions of religion and war. The thief is taken by the townsfolk because of his uncanny resemblance to Christ. When he wakes up from his drunken state, he sees that his body has been molded hundreds of times over. He becomes very angry and destroys these molds realizing that he was played for a ""fool"" and was used for the profit of others. The thief's reaction can also be seen as a commentary on how Jesus himself might have reacted to such fandom when seen as the messiah. The thief keeps one of the molds to symbolize the burden of being looked at as the creator. The thief gets in a dispute with a priest because of his resemblance to Jesus and is thrown out of the church. The thief then eats the mold's face (eating the body of Christ) and sends it to heaven. The thief becomes the Alchemist's apprentice and is shown other leaders of different worlds who will be taking a journey of enlightenment and immortality with the thief and the Alchemist. Each world leader represents a thief of their own craft. The leader of Venus is the thief natural beauty. The leader of Mars is the thief of peace. The leader of Saturn is the thief of purity. The point is not what they represent, but that they all are thief's and in many ways authoritarians of their worlds. The thief of Earth or the fool represents the thief of forgiveness of sin and punishment or Jesus Christ himself. The opening of the film is a pretext for what steps the world leaders or thieves must take to go on the journey to The Holy Mountain. In the beginning of the film, two beautiful women are stripped of their beauty and self-worth. The leaders all must abandon what connects them to their worlds making them human. This is shown through the burning of their money and molded bodies.The thief and the world leaders (alongside the Alchemist) make their way to The Holy Mountain. On their way, many things happen. The thief is told that he must abandon his relationship with defeat by throwing him overboard. This is when we are shown that defeat isn't real and is merely a burden that the thief has held onto. The group discovers the city below the mountain and it's inhabitants. The group discovers these people think they know of The Holy Mountain and what it means. What the group discovers is that these people are delusional and are lost to their vanity. One man thinks it's about drugs. One man thinks it's about strength. And one man just likes hearing the sound of his own voice. The idea is that these things are what are holding them back from true self-enlightenment. This is why the Alchemist had the group detach themselves from what they were in order to take this journey. On their way up the mountain, each member of the group sees their deepest fears and desires. This shows that they too still are clinging on to their past humanity. Once the group finds the immortals, the Alchemist takes the thief aside to send him home. The thief is sent home because he as a Christ figure couldn't properly understand what comes next. What does come next is the realization that it was all a hoax. Or so it seems that way. The Alchemist explains that the journey was never about immortality. But rather, reality. Reality is the true enlightenment. Trying to understand religion or immortality is a useless task. Understanding what is, is what is most important. The Alchemist tells this to the audience because the film isn't about the enlightenment of the people in the film. It is about the people watching it.The Holy Mountain is Alejandro Jodorowsky's most acknowledged and acclaimed film for a reason. It has so much to say with such a simple message. The confusion of understanding the film is the confusion we all have understanding reality and ourselves. It may seem so simple. But without the proper knowledge, we become lost to the world. It was the film Jodorowsky was put on this Earth to make. It truly sets the standard for symbolism and surrealism in film and remains one of the most important films ever made.",The Holy Mountain

122,Gradisca,A fulfilling allegory,10,25 May 2000,"What is enlightenment, and how could people be brought closer to it through a film?  The solution is unexpectedly delightful.The way I see it, the Christ in this film represents the individual who, bombarded from all directions by the absurdities of life on Earth, embarks on a quest for higher meaning - a familiar story.  In this version, however, the author seems to be knowledgeable in esoterica:  turning (****) into gold, which is often thought of the ultimate goal of alchemy, is just a starting point here.  The film leads away from ""reality"", to death and beyond, ultimately coming to a new ""reality"" that can be digested to varying degrees, depending on one's state of mind (open/closed/other).  There are plenty of obstacles along the path, as well as plenty of entertainment, including biting sociopolitical satire and a very strong dose of 70's psychedelia.I don't mean to raise expectations to unreasonable heights, but I consider the film's conclusion a rubedo, a transformation that surpasses the simple moral that a story is ""supposed"" to have.  Though unoriginal, it works so well that I gave it a 10.  (Shakespeare wasn't original either - who cares?) Fans of Fellini and Bun~uel will probably feel quite comfortable.",The Holy Mountain

But with each subsequent viewing more and more becomes evident, even obvious where it had been obscure before, and the viewer will find themselves even more mesmerized and in love with the sheer beauty than previously.Truly a mind-blowing movie, that had an ~enormous~ impact on me, my life, and my mind.",The Holy Mountain

In an era of begpackers and idolized mortals, the film takes a new meaning.Symbolism is everywhere, overwhelming, just like it's meant to be. In this masterpiece, everything seems to have a meaning. The viewer's tossed from surreal costumes to trippy sets like a rag doll, something quite reminiscent of troubled minds, the marginalized of our society, starving for answers. There have been hundreds of Holy Mountains, senseless five-step programs, filthy gurus. Mysthicism always find its way to the suffering mind, suffering being a safe common ground.",The Holy Mountain
132,candlesnstones,your face will contort in confusion,7,25 February 2014,when i began watching it my first thought was. 'ok... something isn't right here. did the reviews [7.8] somehow get screwed up?' then after the initial... lets call it (confusion coupled with mild shock) there was nudity introduced and that kept me watching a little while longer. now keep in mind i don't even like nudity in most films unless its appropriate and given the circumstance it blended in seamlessly.the (confusion/mild shock) continued and even perhaps increased as the video continued. it was about half way completed and 2am. i paused it and went to bed.i woke up and fed the cat etc. etc... sat down and realized this video had been paused and continued watching it. about three quarters of the way through i think i may have understood something. thats right... i had been watching this throughout without a clue. finally satisfied i had figured something out i felt obligated to see it through to the end.i then read a few of the reviews from the highest rated then a few from the lowest. it cleared up some of the confusion. i may watch 'holy mountain' again. why i feel the need to understand or even quasi understand it... i don't know.,The Holy Mountain
133,arturomarcos,The most impressive movie from Jodorowsky (in an spiritual way),10,25 August 2005,"I have seen this movie like 6 times, and each time I think Jodorowsky is really an artist. Just watch it and say. But it will be better if you read some of his books as: ""La danza de la realidad"" or ""El maestro y las magas"", edited this past years. This way you will understand better the universe this guy is moving in. There is a way of watching this,m without prejudices end trying to understand what is he wanting to say. There are scenes completely methaforics but with a clear interpretation. And the end is one of the bests in cinema history (in my opinion), it's something that has been used by some other people, but it has never been used with a complete reason. For the first time a deus ex machina has a real sense. What does this movie talk about? the way of living with a clear objectivity, ergo happy. Don't miss his other films, specially ""El topo"".",The Holy Mountain
134,notforever-534-536860,"Pretentious, doesn't do anything for me",2,21 November 2012,"The film for me wasn't so much a film as a series of imagery. Despite what the plot of the film states, it doesn't really have one. Much like ballet, if you aren't told what the plot is beforehand you wouldn't have a clue afterwards. Admittedly, there is some good imagery in this film, if you are interested in religion, however the imagery seems to have took precedence in the making of the film and has left the film in itself really quite poor. This, coupled with the many unnecessary scenes within the film has just led to ""The Holy Mountain"" as coming across as very pretentious, which is a trait that I personally cannot stand in a piece of film.",The Holy Mountain
135,scottpepe,Fresh n Breezy,10,22 March 2013,"The point of the film is that instead of seeking solace in a higher power, or coveting religious, sometimes mystical symbols, you should put your trust in your friends and enjoy your surroundings. Simple. The film is an overload of quasi religious imagery to highlight the absurd hierarchy that exists in most organised religion.Its a very beautiful film and is, in a way, a rejection of 'El Topo', which presented religious myth in a more outwardly serious way. I think Jordorowsky needed to shrug off the shackles of El Topo which was taken very seriously by many, and just put things in perspective.and i don't really want to write ten lines of text, IMDb.",The Holy Mountain
136,Giannis_Tsiavos,My favorite movie!,10,15 September 2014,"There is probably nothing on earth that can prepare for Alejandro Jodorowsky's masterpiece, holy mountain. The synopsis, as bizarre as it sounds doesn't even come close to describing this amazing film. The film introduces the viewer to an array of characters and freaks unlike any seen on the cinema screen. The Holy Mountain is in turns hilarious, confounding, disturbing and perplexing but this Jodorowsky's love letter to the art is never less than entertaining. Filled with alchemical illusions, tarot symbols, existential ideas, explicit gore and violence, gratuitous nudity, sacrilegious imagery, and perverse beauty, this movie will make you live an unusual experience. MUST SEE!",The Holy Mountain
137,bombinghills-notcountrie,I cannot understand why people like this movie.,2,2 November 2014,"To each their own I guess. I watched this movie after seeing all you people's 10 ratings and how awesome and life changing it was. One of you went so far as to say it should be considered a ""sacred film"" held equally in esteem next to the Bible and other sacred scriptures. So I gave in....And to you IMDBers who gave this movie a 10, my first question is, what are you people smoking and secondly, how can you call this trash a masterpiece?I get it, society is corrupted and war profiteers and military industrial complex are cancers to our planet and humanity. Reality exists beyond the physical and we are dreaming. But how are cows screwing and old naked guys giving other guys facials relevant to that? Is all this blood, feces and cow semen really necessary to enlighten us of a core message? The only reason I'm rating it a 2 is because the kernels of truth about the corrupted system Alejandro weaves into it and the good intent he seems to have had making this film, I'll give him that.Other than that, it's pretentiously artsy and viscerally offensive garbage, guaranteed to give you a bad trip with or without drugs. This is just one man's opinion, to each their own maybe you'll like it go and see..",The Holy Mountain
138,danielle_best-46786,Crazy and wonderful symbolism,8,31 January 2016,"I am still not a 100% sure on the story after a second watch but whatever i watched was funny,crazy, well made and worth watching!It is quite long but stick with it! The metaphors and symbolism are a plenty and it didn't quite make sense in places but i think that is what gives it its charm. You spend most of the time baffled by odd acting and eerie silences! It reminded me a bit of 'Santa Sangre' in that it had a similar feel to it. There is no shortage of the use of dwarfism and limbless people, which i feel gives a strange edge to the film, in the way the characters themselves are perceived. I highly recommend this to people who enjoy similar films to 'el topo' and 'Santa Sangre'",The Holy Mountain
139,EveMastema,A rare film in so many ways,10,9 May 2016,"While some may see this as an overblown art film, I've seen a lot of art films (I'm looking at you Matthew Barney) and this surpasses that, or perhaps sets the standard. People have written their Master's Thesis on this film, so reviewing it seems almost superfluous, but since it's one of my standard films to show people who are willing to watch it, and since I've seen it more times than I can count, I thought I'd start this new account with this film as I re-watched it yet again recently and it's been on my mind. I've come to the realization that whatever you get out of this film, and whatever you take away, it's still worthwhile. That isn't some ambiguous ""all interpretations are valid because art"" statement. There are some pretty clear things in this film, it's just that whether you see it as disgusting, pornographic, bombastic, silly, weird, trippy, brilliant, or transcendent you're kind of neither right nor wrong. It's also hilarious. I think this is one of those films where people think they aren't supposed to laugh, but please do. Laugh, it's part of the process. There are parts in this film that are really just very funny, and that's probably no accident.If I recall this film was uniquely sponsored, and due to the backing and free reign Jodorowsky was able to largely do what he wished with it, which is often the kiss of death for a film but in this case allowed a unique creation that may in some ways define the potential of film to this day. It's a low budget film that uses that exact quality to full potential, spending on what needs to be stunning and offering a level of surreal and poetic imagery that blows most films in the genre away. Whether you see this film as a skewering of spirituality or a sincere attempt to get one to consider it and what a film can mean in that context, it still proves a valuable watch.This film is very confusing and works both on a confusingly direct level and a strange subconscious one. One note is that this was definitely not made in a time and place where nudity or violence was off the table. No one can say no animals were harmed in the making of this, and it's questionable whether any people were too.Still, if you have any interest in watching what is pretty much the iconic film-as-art standard bearer, don't skip this one. In fact, watch it as many times as you can.",The Holy Mountain
140,sezeglin,The Holy Mountain is a Unique and Surreal Masterpiece!,10,20 June 2018,"The Holy Mountain is one of those films that can be enjoyably watched multiple times. I've personally seen it four times and plan to see it many more. The experience of watching this film is a lot like getting a day to explore an entire country. Perhaps an exaggeration, but this film really is that complex in my opinion. Not solely because there is so much information thrown at you in each scene, but because almost every aspect of the film can be interpreted multiple ways. Another word that I'd use to describe The Holy Mountain is surreal. Some of the scenes in this movie, especially the ones in the first twenty minutes, make you feel like you smoked a bushel of weed and then turned on the history channel. It's an experience that can be found by watching no other movie than this one(or at least that I've seen). There are just so many details that can slip right by you on the first or second watch. Some I assume, I have not discovered yet.One thing I really want to stress is that this isn't a pretentious 'artsy' film that takes itself way too seriously. In my opinion this film knows exactly what it's trying to be, and doesn't feel too condescending or pretentious at all. As I give you a summery of what I think the plot means just remember that this is my personal interpretation of the film, and could change the next time I watch it.The film starts out with Alejandro Jodorowsky, as the alchemist, preforming some type of cleansing ritual on two women. He strips them of their cloths, hair, makeup and all cosmetic parts of themselves. On my first watch it was hard to understand what Jodorowsky was trying to convey here, but eventually I found my interpretation. The cosmetic aspects of the two women that are stripped away change their appearance. Much the way that these two women are stripped of what gives them beauty and hides their natural appearance, society is stripped of what hides its true appearance. In other words the film is showing us what society looks like without its artificiality. The society we get from this is very symbolic of how society functions. Keeping this in mind, we carry through the rest of the movie.The thief or Christ-like character lays barely alive in a desert. A man with no arms or legs finds him and tries to wake him up. This represents how the spark of religion is created in the minds of people who suffer greatly in life, or are not mentally strong enough to carry on without some sort of meaning. This is shown by the way that the amputee obviously struggles to walk by himself but does much better on the Christ-like figure/religion's back as shown later. The weak person and the concept of religion are natural friends of each other. What this amputee represents is not stupidity, but the desperate need for guidance in life.A group of boys come along and carry the thief up a hill and fashion him to a cross. The group throws rocks at the thief until one hits him in the head, finally waking him up. He angrily scares the group of boys away, throwing rocks at them. He is about to throw one at the amputee but is offered a joint which makes him settle down. The amputee kisses him on the head and the thief starts to laugh as the two discover their friendship together as previously discussed.The next scene is quite a mouthful. There are so many emotions and so much information conveyed in each shot that it's literally impossible to take it all in with only one watch. The thief's laughter gets louder and carries over to this scene as he walks with the amputee on his back through the streets of a town in Mexico. Surrounding him are mothers ironing blood stained clothing, citizen's being executed, piles of bodies, and soldiers carrying crucified dogs on sticks. Rich people are simultaneously surrendering to the army and taking enjoyably pictures of the executions at the same time. A crowd of poor citizens stands to watch all of this unfold. As the thief laughs with the amputee on his back this represents how all the tragic and atrocious events around him bring the people of earth closer to religion. He is the thief after all, stealing the minds of the citizens of the world and filling them with hope, but also falsehoods and more importantly leverage that can be used to make profits later(this makes more sense to me as the alchemist tells the Christ-like figure that he is a thief of earth, just like there is a thief for each of the other eight planets). The crowd of rich and poor people represents how the world views a war with so many causalities like this. The poor people stand back an awe, disgust or apathy, while some of the rich people look at it with clear enjoyment. This could possibly symbolize how many rich people often make tons of profits off of war or just simply like how unaffected their families are by wars like this, as opposed to poor people who often lose sons and fathers from war(I'm not trying to say all rich people are evil here, I just think the rich people in this scene represent some of the evil in the real world). The women ironing the blood stained clothing represent how families are helpless, watching these wars unfold that often lead to the deaths of a loved ones. It's important to note here that each time these citizens are executed birds fly out from their wounds, this similar to a later scene where Axon and his followers ""kill"" a group of protesters. I still haven't thought about this enough to give you a confident answer, but I think the birds may represent how a nature thrives the more humans are killed, because we are burden to this earth. That might be a perspective that compares strangely to the rest of what I said but it's my best explanation right now.As the rich people take pictures with the corpses a soldier walks over to one of the rich women and begins to have sexual intercourse with her. A rich man gives his camera to the thief so that he can take a picture said man standing by the women and guard having sexual intercourse. This scene and the scenes before make a statement about humanity: If something can be turned into media or entertainment, it has value in society. It's also a little creepy how slimier the rich man's actions are to the way that we use our smartphones today. The same way that he got his picture taken by the two people having intercourse, some people today feel the need to record absolutely every aspect of their life so they can show it to their friends, so that they can say ""I was there when this happened"". The same way that the rich man would show that photo to his friends we might post a photo of ourselves standing by a famous statue or showing a photo of some car wreck we saw, ultimately asking for likes or just attention.After those graphic and powerful shots the thief and amputee arrive at a circus-like setup where the conquest of Mexico is reenacted with toads and lizards. The thief helps out the other people in charge of the lizards and toads. It's important to note that one of these handlers of the toad and lizard 'circus' wore a top hat with a swastika on it(I don't currently have a full answer for the symbolism behind this). This scene is just another example of how society values anything that can be turned into entertainment. As the people watch and give the thief and the others money for the performance, I remind myself that this crowd represents all people of the world and how we justify entertainment with our money. The conquest ends in explosions and blood, and the crowds cheers. The thief approaches a shop manned by Romans with the sign that says ""Christs For Sale"". Small dolls of looking like Jesus are briefly seen for sale. The shop has a cross which the thief begins to carry with the help of the amputee. The Romans realize that he is the spitting image of Jesus Christ and get him very drunk. Eventually he passes out and they use his body in a mold to fashion hundreds of life-size wax Christ figures. Eventually the thief wakes up in a room with these wax figures and becomes furious, realizing what the Romans did. He takes a whip and begins to assault the Romans with it(this is particular shot is a reference to a biblical story where Jesus destroys a marketplace and whips people because they decided to set up shop in a holy temple meant for worship). The thief proceeds to destroy the wax figures in the room with rage. Eventually he just lays there a wax figure that he hasn't destroyed yet. To me, this scene represents the commercialization of Christianity and its modern profit driven nature. One interpretation I had of this scene was that the thief was showing how a real life Jesus would react to today's version of Christianity(not saying that all of Christianity has become corrupt, because clearly there are good Christians. However there have also been multiple recorded instances and articles on how many priests/pastors live in mansions and are rich off of donation money. Another example of the commercialization of Christianity is how mega-churches pass the trays out every Sunday even when many of them could clearly pay their bills with what they already have. The most irrefutable example of this is the way that Christianity is so entangled and woven into politics. Some politicians say ""God"" ten times in every speech they give and yet most Christians would argue that their actions are very antithetical to what the church teachers. Huge tangent here, but I had to explain my personal thoughts).A group of prostitutes look at statue of Jesus Christ. They exit the temple and walk outside where they stand there, looking for new consumers. There is an older women and a young girl in this group. This represents how some people are born into and die in their line of work.I would keep going but I seem to have run out of words...",The Holy Mountain
