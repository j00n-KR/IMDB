0,SnoopyStyle,Wild chaos of wacky A-listers,5,24 March 2014,"Missy (Amanda Seyfried) and Alejandro (Ben Barnes) are getting marry which brings the families of big characters together. Father Moinighan (Robin Williams) and Alejandro's birth mother from Columbia have a bad opinion about divorce. So long divorced couple Don (Robert De Niro) and Ellie (Diane Keaton) have to pretend to be married for the sake of their adopted son.It's a wild chaos of swirling wacky characters. The movie starts off with Diane Keaton catching her ex Robert De Niro getting a bj from Susan Sarandon on the kitchen counter. And the movie is off to the races. I hate to complain about casting, but I'm sick and tired of Robin Williams playing another jokey priest. The cast of A-listers keeps stepping on each other. It's like the big personalities can't find their own niche in the movie. The movie constantly pounds away with the comedy, and it probably nails it once or twice. It's not enough to recommend.",The Big Wedding
1,Prismark10,Bad farce,2,9 May 2019,"The Big Wedding is an adaptation of a French/Swiss film. However this American remake is a flat diabolical farce that trots a well worn road.Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton star as Don and Ellie who are divorced. Their adoptive son Alejandro is from Columbia. He is getting married to Missy (Amanda Seyfried) whose father is an embezzler.Alejandro has invited his birth mother and his real sister over from Columbia. She is a devout Catholic so Don and Ellie pretend to be married even though Don has been with some years living with Bebe (Susan Sarandon) who used to be best friends with Ellie.Robin Williams plays a priest who is a recovering alcoholic just like Don. Their are subplots involving Don's other children, a son who is a virgin and is attracted with Alejandro's flirty biological sister from Columbia. Then there is Don's daughter who is pregnant but estranged from her husband.As the wedding preparations take place a host of secrets are revealed about the various characters.Given the cast involved, this is a blooming awful movie. It is not funny, it is not sexy, it is not even that well made. There is not much original about the film. It is another example of the US studio failing to grasp what made the continental comedy better.Ana Ayora is easy on the eye though.",The Big Wedding
2,nogodnomasters,COULD WE PLEASE JUST SKIP TO THE HAPPY ENDING,6,11 August 2018,"The theme of this film is that ""there are different kinds of love."" Alejandro (Ben Barnes) was adopted from Colombia by Don (Robert De Niro) and Ellie (Diane Keaton). Alejandro is getting married to Missy (Amanda Seyfried) whose parents (David Rasche/Christine Ebersole) are embarrassingly white. Don is divorced and married his mistress Bebe (Susan Sarandon). After a decade his wife and ex-wife get along very well. Robin Williams plays the priest that will preside over the ceremony. There are also two siblings. Dr. Jared (Topher Grace) is a 29 year old virgin. Lyla (Katherine Heigl) just left her husband. Just about everyone in the group has a dirty little secret that comes into play, but for the most part doesn't mesh well.If this wasn't enough, Alejandro's biological mother (Patricia Rae) is coming up from Colombia for the wedding. She is very Catholic and considers divorce a sin. She doesn't know Don and Ellie are divorced so they will pretend they aren't (yawn). She shows up with a daughter (Ana Ayora) who has designs for Jared.The film has great stars and a great indie style plot and characters. The secrets make for a great story. However it didn't come together. The dialouge failed to create on screen chemistry. Too much of the film seemed fake, the characters never hooked you. The humor consisted of embarrassment more than anything. Attempts to make fun of the Catholic Church were weak. It would make for a decent one night rental, but not the heart warming indie keeper we love.Parental Guide: F-bombs. Brief sex, brief nudity (Ana Ayora).",The Big Wedding
3,kosmasp,Messy,7,30 August 2013,"I get why quite a lot of people don't really enjoyed watching this. It does get quite messy towards the end of the movie. Won't spoil that obviously, but I thought it did work for the movie quite well. Also Robert De Niro made a comedy that is actually funny. That fact alone (given his output over the last years, Silver Linings not counting as one of those comedies) should suffice to enjoy the movie.It's the actors actually that make this movie really enjoyable. You get more than a handful (maybe more than some can handle) thrown into the mix and they are giving it their best. The jokes are pretty good, the set-up is good and ripe for exploiting it, in more than one way. If you don't mind the sexual charged theme running through this movie, you will be able to enjoy this movie",The Big Wedding
4,sunwarrior13,An Ensemble Cast Involved In A Disappointing Film,6,2 June 2014,"The Big Wedding is a romantic comedy has a large ensemble cast that includes Robert De Niro, Katherine Heigl, Diane Keaton, Amanda Seyfried, Topher Grace, Ben Barnes, Susan Sarandon, and Robin Williams. The story is about a gathering of a family for the wedding of Alejandro,the adopted son of Don and Ellie. This is a remake of the original French film ""Mon Frère se Marie"",which was written by Jean- Stéphane Bron and Karine Sudan. Justin Zackham wrote the screenplay and directed it.The story is focused on a modern family who is trying to prepare and practically survive a weekend wedding celebration.This happens when long divorced couple,Don and Ellie Griffin decides to once again play a happy couple for the sake of their adopted son's wedding.This was prompted when after his ultra conservative biological mother unexpectedly decides to fly from Columbia to attend the celebration.In the process of doing so,the Griffins are confronted to provide closure to unresolved issues of their past, present and future.Despite the involvement of talented actors and actresses in the movie,it was from being funny and entertaining.The screenplay provides nothing new to the viewer as many have definitely seen the themes presented as a rehash of many films that were shown in the past.Too bad that even the charming actors and actresses involved in it such as De Niro,Keaton,Williams,Seyfried and Grace aren't effective in making viewers laugh as the jokes are far from being refreshing and original.What's worse,Heigl's forgettable performance as a pompous character brings the it down further.Too bad that the cast could not save the film from its poor screenplay.Overall,it was a total disappointment and complete waste of the talent of the cast.",The Big Wedding
5,neil-476,Nowhere near as bad as it is made out to be,7,31 May 2013,"Don and Ellie have three children, lawyer daughter Lyla, doctor son Jared, and adopted son Alejandro. They have been divorced for 10 years, and Don and Bebe (once Ellie's best friend) are hosting Alejandro's wedding to Missy. Alejandro, still in contact with the mother in Colombia who voluntarily gave him up for adoption so that he would have a better life, tells his (three) parents that his mother, who is coming to the wedding, is a staunch Catholic who will be desperately distressed if she knows he has been brought up in a household where the sin of divorce underpins everything, so can Don and Ellie please pretend they are still married? This is the main premise of an ensemble film which is based on a French original. It boasts a stellar cast, and I'm going to buck the trend by saying that I liked it quite a lot. It follows the modern trend of a tendency towards sexual explicitness and bad language in the dialogue (the film opens with a squirm-worthy sequence involving Robert DeNiro and Susan Sarandon being interrupted during oral sex), but I enjoyed the various subplots and I liked most of the characters - they were quite good company.Robert DeNiro as Don does tend to coast a little, but Susan Sarandon in particular is very sympathetic, and I enjoyed all the performances - Topher Grace has a nice line in gentle sarcasm, and I have - as I have a tendency to do - fallen completely in lust with Ana Ayora who plays the sister nobody knew Alejando had, and who presents a very compelling argument in favour of skinny-dipping.This is not a great film by any means, but it is gently enjoyable, and far from being as bad as it is made out to be.",The Big Wedding
6,anaconda-40658,A Big Mess.,3,5 June 2015,"The Big Wedding (2013): Dir: Justin Zackham / Cast: Robert De Niro, Diane Keaton, Susan Sarandon, Robin Williams, Katherine Heigl: A big comedic mess about really finding out who members of our family really are. We have Robert De Niro divorced from Diane Keaton but he is currently involved with Susan Sarandon who was best friends with Keaton years ago. De Niro and Keaton have a son, daughter, and an adopted son who is getting married. Problem is that their adopted son's traditional biological mother doesn't believe in divorce and arrives under the assumption that De Niro and Keaton are married. This doesn't impress Sarandon whose good will to the adopted son is genuine but the lack of ring on her finger results in one of three facial assaults to De Niro. She leaves yet continues to emerge to cater and create further tension. Then we have the adopted son's biological sister who strips down naked for a swim and vocally addresses De Niro and Keaton's biological son sexually in a matter that plainly is the stuff of a smut fairy tale. The screenplay is multiple subplots of sexual escapades and low level comedy. Director Justin Zackham is backed with a great cast but nobody is given a role worth their getting up in the morning to subject themselves to. Robin Williams is given the thankless role of church pastor who gives the usual performance under a stereotype. Katherine Heigl as one of the siblings and she over dramatizes about being recently separated. Woody Allen made art with similar themes in Hannah and Her Sisters. Unfortunately Zackham's film is a big waste of time. Score: 3 / 10",The Big Wedding
7,phd_travel,Despite a stellar cast it doesn't translate well across cultures,2,16 October 2013,"This remake of a French sex farce comedy movie just can't make the transition to an American setting. The sleeping around just seems too contrived and Susan Sarandon forgiving Robert De Niro for cheating just doesn't work outside of a Continental culture.You've got all these great actors to make a funny ensemble romantic/family comedy Robin Williams, Diane Keaton, Susan Sarandon, Robert De Niro, Katherine Heigl, Amanda Seyfried the list goes on but they just didn't have the material to work with. Strange casting of Ben Barnes, the Northern European looking British actor as a person from Columbia. The Latino ethnicity of the character one of the main points of the plot and constantly referred to.A few good points. The house is lovely. There are a couple of laugh out loud moments in between but they are few. Most of the time I just felt aghast at the painful way things went so wrong.A failed attempt at remaking a European movie and a waste of a good cast.",The Big Wedding
8,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Big Wedding,1,10 May 2013,"This could have been a fine romantic comedy and heartwarming family drama, but it turned out to be nothing more than an extension of its trailer, having revealed the entire plot, and a total waste of talent at its disposal. Directed by Justin Zackham, who also adapted the screenplay from the 2006 French-Swiss movie Mon Frere Se Marie, The Big Wedding is light on laughs, and even lighter in its dramatic, emotional moments, making it cold and distant, and never quite achieving anything in its featherweight treatment.Imagine the likes of Robert De Niro, Katherine Heigl, Diane Keaton, Amanda Seyfried, Topher Grace, Susan Sarandon and Robin Williams in your cast list. Filmmakers will kill to get a fraction of that talent in their movies, and Zackham showed prime example just how to flush everyone down the toilet. It's true that if you get good talent, it's half the job done, but being unable to manage and direct, exposed how everyone can just go through the motions to get that paycheck for bill payments. Clocking at less than 90 minutes, everyone has a little bit of screen time, just to turn up, play their caricatures, then retire into the sunset. The premise was set, but hardly anything of note happens, with convenience pretty much summed everything up, and its supposed surprises being pulled off as desperate attempts to add flavour to the mix.De Niro plays Don, who has for many years divorced his wife Ellie (Keaton), and is now in a relationship with Bebe (Sarandon). They all get together when their adopted kid Alejandro (Ben Barnes) is about to get married to Missy (Seyfried), and one would expect hilarity to ensue because of the clash of characters, and hidden agendas amongst all players. Then there's the big lie they have to put up with, because Alejandro's biological mother Madonna (Patricia Rae) is scheduled to attend his wedding, but seriously, at this point, everything had sounded terribly tedious.The narrative then tried to boost its other areas and subplots to pad up the screen time, so we have Don and Ellie's other kids turn up to. Heigl plays Lyla, who has daddy issues and boyfriend woes, while Grace plays virgin Jared, who has the hots for Alejandro's biological sister Nuria (Ana Ayora), a Columbian who plays up Zackman's fantasy that South American girls are hot, and are willing to fulfill all sexual fantasies of American men. Robin Williams was nothing more than a cameo playing a priest, which he had already done to better results in License to Wed.So expect the usual bickering when characters go head up against one another, especially with Missy's parents Barry (David Rasche) and Muffin (Christine Ebersole) doing nothing but to provide one liner revelations of their entanglements with the main family members. Surely this could have been that fine comedy when everything comes crashing down at one large, social gathering, but alas, The Big Wedding fell flat on its face, not knowing exactly what to do with talent and hand, and hampered by an extremely unmoving, and uninspiring story that didn't even try to be smart, since it can't get through to hearts, being without one of its own to begin with.One of the worst films of the year? Well, it's a possibility, given its unbelievable criminal waste of talent.",The Big Wedding

10,StevePulaski,Burdened not by badness but by interchangeability,4,16 August 2013,"Movies like The Big Wedding are movies I'm greatly tired of reviewing. They're movies with insignificant, rather predictable complaints, little plot to dive into, and ones that have their interchangeability working against them more than any plot-point or character ever could. The Big Wedding has a large cast of people you've seen in other, more efficient films and a large piece of ground to cover. By the end, with both of those things, you question how the film managed to find itself a practical ending.The film stars Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton as Don and Ellie, respectively. Don and Ellie were married for twenty years before the marriage soured and now they are divorced, with Don dating Bebe (Susan Sarandon). During his previous relationship, Don and Ellie have three kids, the attractive doctor Jared (Topher Grace), the emotional wreck Lyla (Katherine Heigl), and their adopted son Alejandro (Ben Barnes), who is engaged to Missy (Amanda Seyfried). Got it? Well, it just so happens that Alejandro's biological mom will be flying in from Columbia to see him marry Missy, and because she is from the old-country, possessing ultraconservative values, she looks at divorce with a bad eye. This means that Don and Ellie must return to being a ""couple"" again for the course of the wedding, so that Alejandro's mother will not have any hard feelings towards her son's adoptive parents.Familiarity unfolds as the entire family finds themselves in sticky situations, especially Don and Ellie, who may or may not be reacquainting with feelings they had long back when they met each other. Every actor in here has been in something good and usually knows how to make the worst material into something moderately watchable. This is necessary to note considering the surprising lackadaisical attitude everyone here seems to possess when starring in this film. Even De Niro, who can make the laziest, most uninspired work of screen writing appear at least moderately attentive during his scenes, feels completely uninterested in giving a good performance. The silver-lining is Topher Grace, an actor I've long admired for his traditional likability and common-man persona thanks to his quick-witted nature. Everyone in the film feels as if they're contemplating something better to do.The film was written and directed by Justin Zackham, who too wrote The Bucket List, an amiable and very fun comedy that combined drama and effective comedy to produce a rather optimistic, life-affirming film on cancer. The Big Wedding lacks that sort of impact that film had. It tries to get by entirely on fluffy charm and smiley actors, who only provide the film with their presence and not their effort. Instead of getting to the core of these characters, Zackham prefers to throw them in stock scenarios and give them personalities mannequins would be burdened to fill. Consider Jared, through the course of the movie, trying to hook up with Alejandro's biological sister and have the film continuously nudge the thought of incest in our minds. Jokes like this do nothing but slow the film down to a snail's pace while we hope that some human interest will make our time spent on this film worthwhile.Romantic comedies have long been an uneven genre, some obtaining unforeseen heights, but a great many floundering and never finding a clear path. The Big Wedding can be placed in the latter category with some reservations. This is the kind of film I shake my head at, but don't regard as a total waste of time. This could very easily be someone's idea of a perfect film experience under specific circumstances. There is indeed a strong market for films like The Big Wedding, but even I believe that such a market deserves better than this. At the very least they deserve a modern, average-quality Woody Allen flick.Starring: Robert De Niro, Diane Keaton, Susan Sarandon, Ben Barnes, Topher Grace, Katherine Heigl, Amanda Seyfried, and Robin Williams.

11,Hellmant,Extremely hit and miss but it does have it's funny moments.,6,16 August 2013,"'THE BIG WEDDING': Three Stars (Out of Five) An all-star cast highlights this wedding mishap comedy film written and directed by Justin Zackham (who is probably most well known for writing 'THE BUCKET LIST'). It's a remake of a 2006 french film titled 'MY BROTHER IS GETTING MARRIED' (in English) and is about a couple who pretends to be married (after being divorced for several years) in order to please the biological mother (who's very religious) of their adopted son, on his wedding day. You can probably guess how many things can go wrong from that setup. It stars Robert De Niro, Diane Keaton, Susan Sarandon, Katherine Heigl, Topher Grace, Ben Barnes (of 'CHRONICLES OF NARNIA' fame), Amanda Seyfried and Robin Williams. The movie is extremely hit and miss but it does have it's funny moments and the cast is all fun to watch.The film revolves around a young couple, Alejandro (Barnes) and Missy (Seyfried), who are getting married. While talking to the priest performing their wedding (Williams) Alejandro realizes that his biological mother, Madonna (Patricia Rae), is coming to the wedding and she still thinks he has a traditional family like her. So he asks his long divorced parents, Don (De Niro) and Ellie (Keaton), to pretend to be married while she visits. This upsets Don's longtime girlfriend, Bebe (Sarandon), and she leaves. Alejandro's sister, Lyla (Heigl), is in town with relationship problems of her own and his brother, Jared (Grace), is a 29-year-old virgin doctor who falls for Alejandro's biological sister, Nuria (Ana Ayora). Things get even more complicated from there.The film is your routine wedding family comedy film (the kind they've been doing for years) but it's not nearly as bad as the critics (or box office) make it out to be. It's really funny at times and raunchy; not the type of movie you really want to watch with your family (even though it's a family comedy). The cast is all decent in the film and gives it their all in making the material work. I especially liked Topher Grace as the virgin doctor, being seduced by a sexy latina woman, it's every virgin's dream and Grace plays the insecure nerd part so well (he plays a cocky asshole just as well, so the guy obviously has talent). All the characters are likable and the movie has a lot of heart. It misfires and just gets too odd in plenty of places but like I said it's still a fun movie to watch (if you have 90 minutes to kill).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUymXeqlea0",The Big Wedding
12,Robert_duder,"A fun, raunchy, feel good comedy about a messed up family",8,17 May 2013,"I loved The Big Wedding. It took an ensemble cast and showed why a group of big talent sometimes can do the very best work together. I was very surprised when I read some of the reviews on IMDb that called the film unrealistic and awkward. Are these the same movie goers that makes Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill and so on billion dollar movie actors? Are the disgusting gross out comedies not awkward? This doesn't even begin to touch those in the raunchy department. Much of the film's comedy and drama come in the awkward moments. This is a very dysfunctional family and their sexual misadventures make you squirm and laugh all at once. Perhaps the film isn't incredibly realistic but when do we go to the movies for realism? I go for the exact opposite...escapism and spending two hours with this family was insanely fun. I realized during the movie that I didn't want it to end. I wanted to continue watching these zany and emotional characters and was enjoying every minute of it and that is the mark of a great movie. The cast is just outstanding and with the help of some classy Hollywood legends, this movie was one to watch! Robert Deniro is a Hollywood legend. Even if you don't like the guy as an actor you can't deny his long and versatile career. I thought his performance in this movie was nothing short of brilliant. He was loud and obnoxious and vibrant and a huge jerk and yet completely lovable all at once. I thought this performance was one of his best in a long time and that includes his role in Silver Linings Playbook which he got multiple award nominations for. This was as good, if not better and way more fun. Diane Keaton is also a legend in her own right. She was terrific in this and her dynamic and chemistry with Deniro was just insanely fun to watch. Keaton is so classy and she sort of lets loose a little in this movie so her character was fun and also...she looks incredible!! She is 67 years old!! Susan Sarandon has a smaller supporting role as Deniro's love interest and Keaton's former best friend. Watching the three of them literally makes the film worthwhile and when they share the screen its even more fun. The younger half of the cast holds their own as well. Katherine Heigl, Topher Grace, Ben Barnes, Amanda Seyfried and Ana Ayora all do very well. Its easy to find your favourite character amongst them. Grace and Heigl as siblings have great chemistry and some really great dialogue opposite each other. My only complaint is that we didn't see more of it. I do agree with some negative reviews that said Grace's character was shallow and perhaps unexplored and his quick reversal of ""saving himself for true love"" was uninspired but it fit the film for its purpose. Supporting cast members that absolutely deserve mention include a calm Robin Williams, Christine Ebersole and David Rasche are outstanding as Seyfried's parents.Justin Zackham has a few strikes against him in my books. He is inexperienced behind the camera and he is directing something he wrote...or at least co-wrote. Nine times out of ten this is a bad mix and makes a low budget film that is barely watchable. Well Zackham proves himself but I think a big part of that has to be attributed to the incredibly talented cast. I don't think the film would have been nearly as fun without this cast. At times I had to notice that the film, which is very mainstream, almost had an indie feel to it but it worked for the movie. The setting for the movie, their home and the wedding was lovely to look at beautifully shot. Perhaps the bad reviews come from the fact that younger people aren't comfortable with the older generation talking about sex or being sexy...well...grow up. Regardless there are intertwining stories, laugh out loud moments, cute romances, and just an overall fun experience. Perhaps it is over the top at times and not all aspects of the story worked but for sheer entertainment value I loved it!! 8.5/10",The Big Wedding
13,bowmanblue,False advertising,4,6 October 2014,"The reason I say this film suffers from 'false advertising' is because of the poster. If you look at the (all star) cast on there, you'll see that most of them are laughing. I find this misleading. It makes it seem as if there's at least one funny moment in this film. And there isn't. There really isn't.Right from the word go we're treated to an 'American Pie for adults' scenario which might have been funny ten years ago, but really is just cringeworthingly bad when it's with adults who supposedly should know better. And it's not just the characters that should have known better - it's the cast, too. Like I said 'The Big Wedding' boasts an impressive all star cast. That begs the question why any of them would sign up for this. It simply isn't funny.The plot is tedious, too. A couple divorce because the man finds a new woman. The new woman and ex wife get on brilliantly. If that isn't impossible enough, their son is marrying a 'good catholic' who's birth mother thinks divorce is a massive sin. Therefore the original couple must pretend to be married for the duration of the wedding. That's it. And it's not funny.The characters, as well as being unfunny, are actually pretty unlikeable. It takes some good actors to make every single character as horrible as they possibly could be. And not funny.All in all, just avoid this film. Most people hate it (based on what I've read on other reviews and Internet message boards), but the few people that seemed to like it used words like 'charming' to describe it. I guess there must be some people out there who enjoyed it after all. I noticed they never used the word 'funny' though. Did I mention it's completely devoid of humour? Shame on you Bobby DeNiro",The Big Wedding
14,lesleyharris30,"A Great Cast that Deserved Much Better,",4,22 August 2014,"The Big Wedding is an awful movie with a poorly written storyline and a great comedic cast that sadly weren't enough to make this movie enjoyable.The set up for the movie sounded fun and unique,and then the cast made it sound even better,but sadly there were very few parts that I genuinely laughed at.The movie had such a great cast and didn't use any of them to full effect,Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton didn't really get to show their dramatic acting skills enough,a great actress like Amanda Seyfried wasn't even in it very long,and Robin Williams (One of the Greatest Comedy Actors of All Time,May He Rest in Peace) could easily have improvised all of his scenes and made them so much funnier,but sadly the director obviously made him go by the script,so all of his lines were very dry humour.Usually the fun thing about comedies that revolve around families is that you can relate to them in a funny way,but there is no way anyone could relate to this family's relationship,the ending was probably what irritated me the most though,most of the conflict in this film isn't resolved.The Big Wedding is not a funny or enjoyable movie and I would recommend it to no one.

The movie is funny and I do recommend it but it's a really generic movie that is made better by the casting. The chemistry between De Niro, Sarandon and Keaton is great and really helps the movie. While at its core this is a ""chick-flick"" but don't let that scare you, I am a guy and I did enjoy watching this.

16,callanvass,Hard to believe a movie with such a great cast could be this routine,5,19 October 2013,"Robert DeNiro & Diane Keaton play a former married couple, who are forced to fake a marriage because of their adopted son in law Alejandro (Ben Barnes) Alejandro's real mother is rather adamant about certain things, so DeNiro & Keaton act like they are still married to please Alejandro & his real motherSuch a classic cast, such a disappointment, such lack of laughs. I didn't think this movie was terrible. On the contrary, I found it to be rather watchable, and pleasant, but considering the cast, among other things, this should have been MUCH better than it was. For starters, it lacks the big time laughs this movie needs, despite trying desperately hard to provide those laughs to the viewer. I also had trouble warming up to any of the characters, aside from Katherine Heigl's. Her character's predicament was fairly sympathetic. The movie spends a lot of time trying to put emphasis on the rather estranged relationship between Deniro & Heigl (Who play Father& Daughter here) but it's just so choppy, that it doesn't have nearly the emotional impact that it should. A lot of the characters are so shoddily written. Topher Grace seems to have no purpose in this movie, other than a big attraction to Ana Ayora (Nuria) and it's mainly there for comedic effect. Robert DeNiro is quite amusing, but he's slumming it a little bit. He is much better than the material deserves. His womanizing, immature character provides a couple of chuckles, but nothing more. The love triangle between DeNiro, Keaton & Susan Saranadon wasn't what it should have been, either. Amanda Seyfried's character has little thought put into it, and she has not much character to speak of. Why was she here, again? Oh, that's right. She's marrying Ben Barnes's character. Could have fooled me! I would have liked more drama between Barnes & Seyfried. It just felt so rushed to me, and I was ultimately very disappointed. Robin William's role is nothing more than a glorified cameo. Didn't he play a similar role in License to Wed? Come to think of it. That movie was disappointing as wellFinal Thoughts: It'll keep you watching and pass the time, but don't expect much emotion or effort. It's a very lazy movie. It coasts along due to its terrific cast. I was quite annoyed by the contempt it shows for its audience. It doesn't take much to entertain me, but I was a bit insulted that a movie with this much talent, wound up being as forgettable as it was.5.3/10",The Big Wedding

The story isn't really interesting by itself, and the additional little stories that accompany the main tale aren't helping really. The performances are almost terrible, as the actors don't really try to act, seemed to me as they had given up because of the script that has no freshness, no interest and no humour. Sure, the scenery was nice, but the story kept becoming more and more terrible, as more things were added and in the end the result was a big flop. So 2 out of 10.",The Big Wedding
19,leonblackwood,Disappointing! 2/10,2,20 October 2013,"Review: I really didn't find this movie that funny or even slightly interesting. Everybody seems to be jumping on the band-wagon with these Rom-Com's lately, but this one was pretty terrible. It's hurts to see Robert De Niro prancing around like an blithering idiot. The writing was quite bad and there isn't anything in the movie that keeps it entertaining or watchable. It does get slightly amusing when Robin Williams is introduced, but he's only in the movie for a couple of scenes. The plot does get a bit out of hand when everyone starts confessing to there wrong doings, but by that time I just wanted the movie to finish. Terribly Disappointing! Round-Up: All of the big names in this movie couldn't save it from being a flop. Judging by the money that it lost, I'm not the only one that found this unamusing. The whole messed up family thing who gathers for a wedding, has been played out, and the only way that this type of movie is interesting is when the characters are interesting, which they definitely are not in this case. Is some ways, it's just a typical Diane Keaton movie which is full of unfunny wit and a ridiculous storyline. The director should have let Robin Williams loose.Budget: $35million Worldwide Gross: $22million (What a loss!)I recommend this movie to people who are into there films which are based around a couple getting married with a dysfunctional family preparing the wedding. 2/10",The Big Wedding

21,estebangonzalez10,101 Introduction to Mainstream Movie Clichés,2,17 August 2013,"""Would somebody just punch me in the face again?""The best thing I can say about The Big Wedding is that it is only 80 minutes long. If it were 10 minutes longer I don't think I could've made it through the entire thing because it is such a forceful mess with clichés thrown all over the place. At least in other mainstream romantic comedies you have a main story that reaches its conclusion nicely wrapped up with a beautiful ribbon on top, but here you have like five different conflictive stories that magically reach their resolution in less than 10 minutes. Not even Houdini could pull off a trick like that. The entire film focuses on this one messed up family where each member is going through some difficult moment in their relationship and after hearing them ramble for 70 minutes they all peacefully find their resolution and live happily ever after. The Big Wedding is class 101 in Introduction to Mainstream Movie Clichés. What made things even worse is that director Justin Zackham (whose major film credit is writing the screenplay for The Bucket List) had an all-star cast to work with here and none of the characters felt like a real human being. Everyone played a one dimensional and stereotypical character. This is one of the laziest and most shameful movies of the year and I doubt many people will enjoy this ""comedy.""Alejandro (Ben Barnes) and Missy (Amanda Seyfried) are a young couple preparing for their big wedding, which means that Alejandro's dysfunctional family has to come together for this special occasion. Alejandro was adopted and raised by Don (Robert de Niro) and Ellie (Diane Keaton) until they were divorced and Don's mistress, Bebe (Susan Surandon), moved in. Don and Ellie had two other children prior to adopting Alejandro: Lyla (Katherine Heigl) and Jared (Topher Grace). Apparently after their divorce Ellie abandoned the country and Lyla broke ties with her father. Now 10 years later everyone gets together for Alejandro's marriage. The only problem is that Alejandro has always kept close ties with his real mother from Colombia, Madonna (Patricia Rae), a devout Catholic who disapproves of divorce and therefor he has never told her anything about his adoptive parents separation. He asks Ellie and Don to act like a married couple and that pretty much leaves Bebe out of the picture thus creating a bit of chaos and building tension along the way. There isn't anything nice I can say about this movie so I will keep my review short. There are several other stories and things going on in this film that barely get touched on the surface or are simply used as a gag and not dealt with. Robin Williams plays the priest who is going to marry the couple (we've seen him play this same role in the past). Alejandro is not a catholic and doesn't want to lie to the priest about his beliefs because he doesn't think it would be right, but on the other hand he is capable of lying to his mother about his adoptive parents. I had an issue accepting this and I guess it was a main concern because at one point this is addressed in the film, but it is resolved rather lazily like pretty much every conflict that arose in the film. Everything just felt so fake that it was hard to really identify with any of the characters because none of them played a real human being. This isn't the way conflicts are resolved. Nothing about this film is recommendable, and what makes matters even worse is that such a talented cast was put to waste with this terrible screenplay. The Big Wedding is one of the worst films of 2013.",The Big Wedding
22,pixrox1,Maybe this whole thing would work better as a French farce . . .,7,1 June 2013,". . . since the strange inhabitants of that weird country seem to laugh at anything that is NOT funny, especially if there is a hint of sex in it, nudge-nudge, wink-wink, the more inappropriate, the better (check out Catherine Breillaut's FAT GIRL, if you need an example). OH, WAIT!! On the ""connections"" page at this site, it is stated that THE BIG WEDDING is a REMAKE of a film from 2006 entitled MON FRERE SE MARIE. Now, finally, after many long years, those days I thought I was wasting in 9th grade French class pay off! Based on my expertise painfully garnered from scores of tortuous hours cramped into the blonde wooden audio study carrel at my school's language lab, I can say WITHOUT A SHADOW OF A DOUBT that the original version of THE BIG WEDDING was FRENCH (by the way, Mr. Cuthrell, I'm still not sure if I'll ever use ALGEBRA before I die!). Well, knowing this juicy tidbit of trivia excuses a lot, since everyone knows FRENCH HUMOR DOES NOT TRANSLATE into Americanese. But if you watch this again with the knowledge that what you have here is a bunch of American and Spanish people PRETENDING TO BE FRENCH, maybe the whole shebang will be funnier!",The Big Wedding

After all the bad reviews, I assumed it was going to be bad, but I was pleasantly surprised, kinda. This film was actually not half bad, pretty good actually. Many jokes and scenes in the movie were funny. Also, the acting was very good here, from all the actors.

Back in 1958 they had a pushing 30 Steve McQueen playing a 17 year old high student and even then audiences found their credulity pressed a bit. What would make a director believe the same would not hold true today even if it is a bit of a reverse. Does anyone really want to see a movie that features their great grandparents having sex? Perhaps better casting might have helped this film, along with a better plot, direction, and writing. And yes this is the age of the potty comedy as The Hangover series can attest; but sometimes the age of the actor can alter crude to just gross. Really, does any 20 to 30 something, the typical moviegoer, see Keaton as a sex object? Note that Galifianakis (over 40) and Cooper (pushing 40) are also getting a bit long in the tooth to sustain credibility.",The Big Wedding
25,peterp-450-298716,"Yep,another wedding again ...",5,11 February 2014,"My mom is Jbuddist, which is Jewish slash Buddhist Occasionally I have to give in and look at a ""romcom"" over the weekend. My wife is happy because she can see another chick flick again. And I'm happy because my braincells get a rest once again while watching a movie. You really don't need those during ""The Big Wedding"". The only reason why I wanted to watch this movie was the fact that there were quite a few big stars participating in it. Robert De Niro, Diane Keaton, Susan Sarandon, Robin Williams and Topher Grace. But a sublime cast can't always save a movie. That's cristal clear.I have to admit, it's not a movie that completely sucks and it meets all the requirements needed when the content of the movie is about organizing and completing a wedding. It's one out of a dozen and completes the list of previous wedding movies such as ""Father of the Bride,"" ""My Big Greek Wedding,"" ""Honeymoon in Vegas"" and ""Wedding Crashers."" The latter is on a different level, but the typical cliché jokes are also in it. Besides it seems to me that Diana Keaton has a weakness for such movies. Again she shows up as the mother of the (this time) groom.Something inevitably always must be present in these movies ... a pond nearby. This is absolutely needed so that there's invariably a splashing water scene in the movie. Fetishists are waiting for this to appear so the tears of merriment roll down their cheeks. In ""The Big Wedding"" it was used twice. First time when the beautiful naked body of Ana Ayora disappears in it (The drooling part) and the second time as Robin Williams tumbles in it (The slightly less drooling part). The latter has however retained greatly in terms of exaggerated acting and seems to have had a dose of sedatives so that he doesn't start trotting around in a hyper-kinetic way. Anyway, I thought for a moment that I had already seen this movie, but I confused this movie with ""License to wed"" in which he also played the role of a priest. Personally I found the confession scene extremely funny and hilarious. I even had to laugh briefly.I thought the rest of the cast played on autopilot. De Niro showed up again in his dressing gown and seemed to come straight out of ""Meet the Fockers"". Keaton looked like an old tart who realizes that her days of extreme sexual appetite are over, but still gets pleasantly surprised during the course of the story and discovers that those cobwebs suddenly disappeared. The dialogues between both were sometimes funny and entertaining. Sarandon plays as always like an old cow. Katherine Heigl was there for the dramatic part. The most imaginative and funny role was played by Topher. The not so bad looking doctor who is already 29 years and never shagged anybody is running the whole movie after the South-American Nuria like a horny turned-on ape.The inevitable misunderstandings follow each other in rapid succession. The divorced Don and Ellie need to fake that they are still married, with some uncomfortable situations as a result. They end up in bed again. What a surprise ! The new girlfriend is pushed aside a bit what pisses her off and she takes revenge by unexpectedly appearing everywhere. The daughter is trying to get pregnant for years already and now has an allergic reaction to anything that has to do with babies. Eventually she turns out to be pregnant just as she broke up with the future father. Sigh ... The South-American girl first wants to start something exciting with the 29 year old son who is, as mentioned earlier, still a virgin. But after a friendly chat with the mother she doesn't want that anymore. As a result the son walks around like a frustrated teenager with his pants too tight. The handjob by the South American during dinner reminded me immediately of ""Wedding Crashers"". As icing on the cake it turns out that there are more persons who had an affair. Some even like to do it with someone of the same sex . Don't worry, no one will be offended , and life goes on as usual. Felt strange to me anyway.Well, it was a fun movie just for passing time on a Sunday, and the benefit of such movies is that the playtime isn't that long. Afterwards you feel relaxed and you're happy you didn't end up in such a crazy family.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/",The Big Wedding

27,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Big Wedding,6,4 June 2014,"As I sat in the theater a few months ago, I saw a trailer for what I believe to be a fun Spring release with a big name cast (heck, two of them were in The Godfather Part II). Added to that, I guess wedding season is coming up (I'm not married but I did look it up) so I figured this film was being put in theaters at just the right time. Now that I have viewed what is a true exercise in scatterbrain utopia, I'm realizing all along that a bunch of stars involved in any type of movie, or should I say, in any type of movie genre, doesn't guarantee greatness. Granted, I was entertained by little snippets here and there, but I thought to myself, am I watching a movie or am I just viewing dailies. I couldn't really tell ya to be honest. With this major gray area fluttering through my brain, I did however become enamored by the plot (or idea of a plot). It seemed original and sort of refreshing (so many films about weddings seem so arbitrary). It goes like this: Don Griffin (played emphatically by Robert De Niro) has an adopted son who plans on getting married in the next couple of days. His adopted son Alejandro (Ben Barnes), brings his biological mother all the way from Columbia to attend his wedding. Added to that, his biological mother believes that marriage is sacred and that no one should ever ever get divorced. This forces De Niro's character to pretend to be married to his ex-wife (Ellie Griffin played by Diane Keaton) for the remainder of the weekend in which the wedding occurs. So you see, there is a storyline here. It's too bad that the execution is so darn sloppy.So not to be confused with one of Robert De Niro's earliest films, The Wedding Party (1969), I am reviewing The Big Wedding which is not so much of a movie as it is a bunch of individual scenes crammed together inside all of 89 minutes. There are some funny moments and Bob's character is a riot (he plays the ultimate ladies man/lousy ex-husband and father), but along with him, there are far too many other subplots and adult situations to keep up with. What's worse, the film jumps back and forth in no particular order to established these subplots and throw at the audience, the chaos everyone is going through. This all happens all in the course of maybe a day or two. And it all happens at, you guessed it, a wedding and the pre-wedding festivities.What we have here with this blatant misfire, is that it's the type of vehicle that feels like it starts in the middle. Some movies do a somewhat of an effective job at portraying this. Common movie going knowledge says you have to figure out what has already happened in your imagination and try to keep up with the continuum of what is already going on. The Big Wedding sadly, is not one of those types of movies. For the life of me I couldn't figure out why certain characters were mad at each other or resented each other (if you want to know what I'm talking about, pay attention to Katherine Heigl's character, Lyla Griffin). Also, I got annoyed by a lot of scenes where the whole cast were feverishly trading dialogue with one another. It felt like they didn't talk to each other (or look each other in the eye) but kinda talked just to be heard. Or better yet, the banter between them in most scenes gave me the feeling that they were literally caught in a different movie all together. There were a couple of examples of this but mainly, you have to watch the sequence where the whole family is having lunch on the patio of their big Connecticut house. It almost looked like everyone's speaking parts were filmed individually. For the sake of all the crew who probably worked very hard on The Big Wedding, I'll just admit that I might be exaggerating.All things considered, The Big Wedding has a couple of amusing moments (I can't get the image out of my head of De Niro lighting up and smoking two cigarettes at once) and it's an hour and a half of mindless fun. It's probably worth a poultry 5-7 bucks for a matinée showing. But really, if you go into the theater thinking you're watching an actual movie, then you're in for a ""big"" disappointment.",The Big Wedding
28,napierslogs,"Building an entire wedding movie around sex jokes, but adds in some well-timed honest family drama",6,26 April 2013,"""The Big Wedding"" seems to be following in the footsteps of the recent Hollywood romantic comedies – gather as many big name stars as you can and put them all in a romantic comedy storyline. It's the best of the bunch, even though that's not saying anything at all. It's also based on a French film ""Mon frère se marie"", and that's not really saying all that much either.Any description of the plot is just going to read as a listing of who's who of Hollywood. But let's do it anyways: We have the patriarch and matriarchs (Robert De Niro and Diane Keaton and Susan Sarandon); we have the up-and-comers excited for their big day (Ben Barnes and Amanda Seyfried); and then we have the middle siblings who have had their time in the spotlight and are starting to fade away (Topher Grace and Katherine Heigl).The wedding revolves around lies (obviously) and religion - with Robin Williams as the drunken Catholic priest. And it also includes lots and lots of sex jokes. The surprising thing that audiences are taking away from this film, especially in spite of the decidedly negative critics' responses, is that it is hilarious. Fans of the film will find themselves laughing from beginning to end. But to give you fair warning, all of the jokes are sexually-based, and I mean all of them.Laughing at the Catholic stigma of don't have sex but if you do, don't be safe; laughing at people who have too much sex; laughing at people who don't have sex; and worse of all, laughing at divorced and married couples who have sex with one another. While some of the jokes were funny, they're also responsible for creating the uneasy dynamic amongst the characters – all of whom are family (or, at least, are about to become in-laws). At times the film crosses the line from funny dysfunctional family to repulsive dysfunctional family.The one line that ""The Big Wedding"" straddles well is that between comedy and drama. The film is effective when it moves from funny jokes to touching family honesty and back to some more funny jokes. The story lines are very predictable, and sometimes the jokes are too simple and too wrong, but it tries to add in the right amount of drama, and ultimately, it should be entertaining to fans of the genre.",The Big Wedding

The film itself is very formulaic, from the second scene it is obvious a Shakespearean farce is being constructed. There are few surprises as all the elements slot in to place.Predictably does not necessarily make a bad film.

Nonetheless, I cannot help but feel that Robert DeNiro, Dianne Keaton,Susan Sarandon and, even, Katherine Heigl have better things to do with their time; such as, practically anything.Production values are top notch and, at least, you can understand all of the one liners. However, the string of cliché dialog and situations kept me searching for even one nugget of creativity. DeNiro, the alcoholic artist who cheated with his ex-wife's best friend and is now afraid to make a marriage commitment? Diane Keaton, the ever-understanding ex-wife, who holds no grudge against her best friend. Katherine Heigl, the barren daughter, estranged from her cheating father?

This film brings together De Niro and Keaton who also co-starred in Godfather II nearly 40 years ago.One must acknowledge that the lead cast, albeit a strong one, worked well together and pretty much carried the film through leaving everyone else in their shadows even if they included established actresses such as Heigl and Seyfried, not to mention Williams.As a viewing experience it was a charming, pleasant one though without ever reaching any highs as a comedy. They were few laughs but nothing too hilarious.Overall, this is only saved by the gracing presence of De Niro, Keaton and Sarandon who are natural in winning an audience and although it will not remembered as the great comedy, still it is one that manages to exhume some warmth in the midst of a family in chaos.",The Big Wedding

Familiar names from Diane Keaton and Robert di Niro to Susan Sarandon and Topher Grace to Katherina Heigl and Robin Williams to Christine Ebersole and Amanda Seyfried display glorious comic emotion and elegant tight ensemble work in a story which outlandishly simulates the heavy emotive baggage those invited to a formal wedding ceremony choose to hide from or fling at each other. Even the public television recurring series DOWNTOWN ABBEY highlighted an episode with this plot line in the United States this spring and this one was much more tastefully done. The running time of this film seems the shortest of the multiple Hollywood films on the parallel premise suggesting the name stars could not mutually block in enough shooting time or the director could not come up with enough ongoing plot complications or whatever to keep the story going for at least an hour and three quarters.

Which is both surprising and disappointing considering how much star power is in it. And not that there weren't some good moments, because there were. But it could have been, and should have been, so much better. And it all boils down to the writing. The actors and actresses can only work with what they are given to work with and in this picture they were given, for the most part, predictable scenes and uninspiring lines. Susan Sarandon was good, because Susan Sarandon always is. Diane Keaton waswell Diane Keaton. Think about it. If you like her in one part, you will like her in any part, because she mostly plays the same person. Has ever since Annie Hall, basically. Trouble is, there was nobody who stood out, who really shone so you could say, well, the movie was only fair, but I really liked Again, it all comes back to the writing - which didn't particularly put in a stellar appearance for this film. It's an okay movie. That's about it.",The Big Wedding

I at this point admit I couldn't watch the last 15 minutes, it's one of the only films I've not finished ever! I think 3 was generous and maybe was awarded what this could have been, using a wedding is a guaranteed setting to bring either laughs or touching emotions. This film did neither, it was a sea of constant swearing, awkward chemistry between the actors and down right laziness from. The director.The relationships within the family were very strange, brother and sister that seemed a little too close as well as a family that just didn't mesh! Hiring actors is someone's job and no matter how talented individuals are, if they don't gel then the film sucks.The humour was childish and really irritating, an under lying arrogance just made it unwatchable, De Niros worst ever film, it's such a shame as it could have been a classic!Lastly there is a real need to find good comedic women actresses , the two main seem to be Heigl and bridesmades Kirsten Wiig! Neither are good at acting, they'd be OK as extras but are just not likable to lead films.A waste of time and effort! Avoid!",The Big Wedding
46,twilliams76,Decline the invite to The Big Wedding.,2,16 August 2013,"If you get this invite in the mail, reject it. Reject it immediately! The Big Wedding is a big cast disappointment filled with off color jokes, juvenile sexual pratfalls, perplexing situations and relationships, ridiculous dialogue, dated material and off-putting or offensive moments. The one thing it has going for itself is its respectable cast but they are so horribly misused and abused I have no idea why a single one of them signed up for this travesty.Robert De Niro (Cape Fear) and Diane Keaton (Father of the Bride) play divorced parents who are reuniting at a beautiful lake house for the wedding of their ""brown-skinned"" adoptive son, Alejandro (Ben Barnes - Dorian Gray), to a lovely blonde (Amanda Seyfried - Dear John). It is said by several characters that he is Italian because his future mother-in-law (Christine Ebersole - Black Sheep) fears brown-skinned Hispanic babies although he is supposed to be Colombian (but Barnes is actually a British actor who apparently hit the tanning beds a few times before filming the role ... not offensive at all, no?). Susan Sarandon (The Client) is the father's new girlfriend although she was at one time also their mother's best friend. The entire situation could be very awkward but the trio makes the best of it ... even as one of them walks in on the other two going at it on the kitchen counter. Yes, really.So many of the moments in The Big Wedding had me question whether or not I was actually seeing what my eyes were (sadly) ACTUALLY seeing because the content and situations were so dreadfully bad (not to mention embarrassing to some of the actors).Topher Grace (Take Me Home Tonight) and Katherine Heigl (The Ugly Truth) play Alejandro's two adoptive siblings -- him as a sexually-challenged doctor who is relentlessly pursued by Alejandro's ""real"" sister (uh -- gross but played by Ana Ayora - Marley & Me) who comes to the wedding and her as a cold who-knows-what. Her purpose is to act sour and frustrated throughout the entire movie (perhaps she was the only one who read the script and couldn't help but act this way after being contractually obligated to appearing in it).The Big Wedding is another ""wedding shocker"" (think 'Game of Thrones') but for a different reason ... this one is unbelievably SHOCKINGLY bad. There isn't even a word for how bad this is. Four Oscar WINNERS in this cast (the fourth is Robin Williams playing a manic and bumbling priest) and we get this tripe? There is honestly very little good to be said about this movie. The lake house is gorgeous. The couple chose some nice wedding colors. And ... that is just about it.If you can, RSVP with something nice to say!",The Big Wedding

Saying this film is full of explicit sex, wow some people must lead sheltered lives, they should watch some of the series now like Game Of Thrones, Outlander, The collection, Girlfriend Experience just to name a few, which are border line porn. This film is worth a watch just for the great actors in it, i mean you cant go wrong with Diane Keaton, Robert D Nerio and the great Susan Serandon and sadly watching the wonderful Robin Williams made it a bit poignant to watch but reminded me of what a wonderful actor and versatile he was. OK the plot is thin but it had lots of funny moments and omg i love Katherine Heigl she is now one of my favorite actresses. Its worth a watch to just enjoy all these great actors.Its a romp a silly one its whats on the box, The Big Wedding. Its been done before and will be done again. I watched on Netflix, free, on a very wet rainy miserable day and I enjoyed every minute of it.

Yay?..not so much. It's lamer than a sock puppet. Stale jokes and embarrassing jokes. Non jokes. All is going nowhere. Apparently making a film for this audience involves just rounding up the usual suspects in the same age range and making same 'naughty' sex jokes so this age group will relate to the characters and ""feel young again"".

Sarandon is Deniro's long-time live-in mistress who's catering the reception. Williams is a drunken, but conservative priest throwing out one-liners. Daughter Heigl just broke up and turns out to be pregnant. Son Grace is a 30-year old who you just know is going to fall for his step-brother's hot sister, who's visiting with his non-English speaking birth mother that everyone bends over backwards for for some reason, like Keaton and Deniro pretending they're still married.

52,ron-fernandez-pittsburgh,Not bad at all...,7,18 August 2013,"While THE BIG WEDDING is no great shakes of a movie, it's much better than the bad rap it's been getting. The stars, ROBERT DI NIRO; DIANE KEATON; SUSAN SARANDON and even ROBIN WILLIAMS, who I do not like, are very good with what they've to to work with. Story is trite, but fun. One can see the outcome from miles away, but so what. Nice photography, location of the main house and some very funny situations make this an almost hit. Would have like to have seen more of Sarandon and Keaton as they never disappoint. Di Niro does extremely well in a role far different from anything he's done before. Very impressed with Ben Barnes. He's an English actor...you'd never guess as his American accent is perfect. Also has to speak Spanish at times and is very believable. Don't miss Christine Ebersoles very funny turn as the bride to be's Mother. Wish she had more footage as well. So if you have nothing else to do I would recumbent THE BIG WEDDING for a fun evening.",The Big Wedding
53,apb216,What was that?,4,28 August 2013,"I was really not a fan of this movie. I love most of the people in the cast but there were a lot of very obvious parts of the plot that you had to have been really stupid to not see coming, and the characters were just plain annoying. It's about a messed up family, De Niro and Keaton who are divorced with 2 kids (Heigl & Grace) and an adopted kid...that I guess was for some reason in touch with his real mom, who is Spanish and super religious and doesn't believe in divorce...anyway, the adopted guy is getting married to Seyfried, so the whole family is back together. When the Spanish mom and sister arrive, they decide that the best course is to pretend that De Niro and Keaton are still married even tho De Niro has a long time girlfriend. What annoyed me so badly was that whoever directed this movie tried to make it one of those movies that keeps you guessing and they slowly reveal plot twists as they unfold...yet none of them are surprising or make the movie more fun to watch. Actually, it does the exact opposite...it makes you bored to death and I had a very hard time paying attention, and when those plot reveals came I just didn't care anymore. While it was refreshing to see Katherine Heigl play a character that is not anything like her norm, the character annoyed me to death. She plays a distressed, obviously pregnant (they tried to make that a surprise), slightly rebellious daughter that openly hates her father and overdoes the sarcasm and disdain. Topher Grace plays a virgin doctor that specializes in delivering babies...and for some reason his character missed the signs that Heigl was pregnant, even though she faints upon seeing babies and then throws up all over her dad. The whole thing was just so annoying I couldn't even stand it. Robert De Niro was the biggest disappointment of all. I can't decide if I just hated his character or I hated his acting. This is the second movie he's been in lately where his character drove me insane (Silver Linings Playbook) and it was pretty obvious he was just there for the paycheck. Keaton, Sarandon and Seyfried were the only ones that held it together. Bottom line...don't waste your time, it's not worth it.",The Big Wedding
54,MacTheMovieguy,almost impossible to hate a movie with this cast,5,23 July 2014,"It's almost impossible to hate a movie with this cast. I realize this is an easy target for critics, because the movie itself is so mediocre, but it's not an awful movie. It just is unnecessary. It doesn't really go anywhere, or offer anything new. It also refuses to challenge the actors in the film with any good material. That being said, it is really easy for such terrific actors to excel in such incredibly bland roles. For that, I think the film is saved a little bit.Alejandro (Barnes) is getting married to Missy (Seyfried). They're both well educated, and their families are super rich. Alejandro was adopted by Don (DeNiro) and Ellie (Keaton), who have since divorced. Don is now with Bebe (Sarandon), who was Ellie's best friend. Everyone has remained amicable, it seems, though no one has spoken to each other in years. This wedding brings everyone together. Alejandro has two siblings, Lyla (Heigl) and Jared (Grace). Lyla's story is that she can't get pregnant, so she broke it off with her husband (Bornheimer) right before Alejandro's wedding. Jared's plot development revolves around him needing to lose his virginity (no, I'm serious, that's the plot they gave Topher Grace). Alejandro throws a big bomb into the family when he announces he invited his birth mother (Rae) to the wedding. She brings along his sister (I think), who Jared immediately develops a crush on. Mild drama ensues. Williams is underused as a recovering alcoholic priest.I say MILD drama. This movie refuses to tackle any major issues, and everything is resolved nicely with a neat bow on top. Everyone forgives everyone for everything ever. The movie is entirely beneath everyone involved. For their part, the actors pretty much all seemed to enjoy making the film, and work well as a unit. Keaton is the only one I might say felt like she was ""phoning it in"". Maybe she was only drawn to the project so she could work with Sarandon and DeNiro again. Williams could be accused of phoning it in, but I would argue he is underutilized in the first place. Don't cast a known funny man in what could be a funny role, and then not allow him to do his schtick.This could have been an awful movie with a different cast, but somehow they make it work. This really is an example of making lemonade from lemons. I'm not sure I would recommend this film to anyone, as it is largely a pointless film. But if you find yourself stuck watching it, you'll be surprised at how you didn't actually hate it by the time it is finally over. Well, you'll hate the film, but you'll still love the cast. It's odd how that works out.",The Big Wedding

59,naregian,Overshadowed by Pain & Gain. Was a solid film.,7,27 April 2013,"The potential was definitely not reached in this film. The script had some lightly sophisticated humor but didn't include as much wit as it could have been successful with. It was a pretty light R rated film, carrying a few sexual jokes and scenes, and a few F bombs. Much of the humor was based on sexual dialog, which might've been okay but it didn't carry any depth, and just had somewhat lame sex jokes.By no means was this a BAD movie, it really wasn't, but it could have been much better. The all-star cast did have some nice on screen chemistry and I liked the charm and wit brought on by the great young actors, namely Topher Grace. (I might be biased because I loved That 70s Show.)I feel like the release of this film was very overshadowed by Pain & Gain, and the marketing and promotion of THIS movie was no where near enough. One thing this film did get right was the trailer. It revealed just enough for you to be intrigued, yet not feel like you know the whole film, so if you think the trailer revealed the whole movie, go ahead and see it and you might be pleasantly surprised.

I was aware I was going to see another common American comedy which takes advantage of a very good cast with both young and old performers. I was not disappointed because I saw a nice average comedy. Although not my favorite genre, I usually enjoy commercial comedies. The cast (Diane Keaton, Susan Sarandon, Robert Deniro, Topher Grace, Amanda Seyfried, Ben Burnes...) is the strongest element in the movie. They do not portrait the performances of their careers, but they did a fine job and are usually nice to watch. They show they can work in many kinds of roles and movies. I particularly like Deniro (objectively, the best actor nowadays) and Grace. The pace and duration are very proper, too. The director is unknown, but he has done a good job taking into account that the project is not ambitious at all. At least, this movie is not as predictable as many comedies in a few points. Another good point in the movie is the photography. I do not exactly where it all takes place, but it is very nice (the house, the lake, etc.) The bad thing about the movie is that it is not so funny and has no differentiator factor from many other comedies. In conclusion, I recommend to see ""The big wedding"" with relatives, friends, etc. You will surely have a good time if you enjoy comedies, but you will forget about it in a few minutes. 6,5.",The Big Wedding

Bear in mind that for a majority of the audience English is not their first language either.A word of caution for prudes. There are three scenes of a highly sexual nature that are extremely funny for those who are not.This is another in the growing trend of using mature actors and it is good to see Diane Keaton and Susan Sarendon in starring roles where some years back they would have disappeared from our screens. Robert De Niro is excellent, as ever and Robin Williams in the smaller part of the quartet of Oscar winners, made this a foursome of very funny performances.The rest of the cast also turned in fine performances and I think they must have had lots of fun making the film.

About twenty minutes into the movie, I thought to myself, ""I bet the director also wrote the screenplay."" And as the end credits started, boom, there it was: directed by, screenplay by. Granted, it is adapted from a French movie. But along with directors directing their own screenplays, English adaptations of French comedies are my biggest pet peeves. The comedy just does not translate; watch the original with subtitles. Please. And the list is endless: Jungle to Jungle, The Birdcage, Dinner for Schmucks, True Lies, Mixed Nuts, and more. Some may even end up being blockbusters, but it's like reading the 8th sheet under the carbon paper*, it's a very pale replica and you can barely make out the comedy, or the charm.* For those who do not know what carbon paper is, it's a pre-historic method of making copies. Google it.What I enjoyed about the movie is the following: the romance, the sweetness, the touching moments. There was an abundance, but ruined by a heavy, clumsy punch line every time.. I wish that one person had read the adapted screenplay and had mentioned that it wash't funny, at all.The actors also made it easy to watch. All veterans, even the younger cast, they were each able to give heart to their characters. Beautifully acted.

I don't mind profanity in a film if it makes the story more believable but profanity for the sake of profanity is the sign of a weak script. I'm not talking about profanity in The Big Wedding; I'm talking about pure unadulterated filth. Also I think it's time for Susan Sarandon to hang it up; yes, she's lost almost all of her credibility as an actor and now seems intent on taking any role offered. Robert DeNiro is obviously uncomfortable in his role but still manages to shine in his role, Katherine Heigl is fantastic, but if there's someone worse than Susan Sarandon it would have to be Diane Keaton. Ms. Keaton wouldn't even shine in a high school production unless the role called for a fake laugh. Ms. Keaton, whether it's on a late night talk show or in one of the many ""clinkers"" she's been in, seems to use a phony laugh as an escape for lack of talent.

71,pacificboy,The stars can't save it,2,16 August 2013,"As a fan of four key people in the cast (De Niro, Keaton, Williams, Sarandon), it was pretty much a given that I was going to see this, even if the ads told me that I was destined for a rough ride.There was a certain stripe of made-for-TV movie in the 1980s and early 90s, movies with titles like ""Crash Course"" and ""Baby of the Bride."" They featured casts bursting with stars of all the then-hot series (Jackee, Rue McClanahan, etc.) and wacky premises (a wacky driver's ed school! a pregnant old woman!) and were just as terrible as they looked in the ads. ""The Big Wedding,"" from its title to its awful script, is just the big-screen version of one of those disposable made-for-TV clunkers. The only thing setting it apart is the caliber of star they managed to get for this crapfest and the ""sexual"" situations involved in some of the plot. Even De Niro's raunchy dialogue seems forced, as if the filmmakers were desperate to set their movie apart from bad TV movies.That said, I expected that at least the cast would make it worthwhile. I mean, we've all watched movies just for the cast, or seen otherwise lousy movies that were redeemed to some degree by a favorite actor. None of that is the case here. De Niro's been phoning it in for the last decade or so, and this is no exception. Keaton plays the same role she's been playing since ""Something's Gotta Give"" put her back on the radar. Sarandon acquits herself. But worst of all is Williams, who has less than five minutes on screen in a part anyone could've played. It actually feels as if he was directed NOT to ad lib or have any fun with the role. It's an extended cameo that he could've made shine, but there is NO ""Robin Williamsness"" in his performance.

Personally, what I love about this kind of romantic comedy film is the modern set.I got the chance to see the film last night, and I expected to laugh out loud but i didn't, I was so disappointed because the film is plain boring and there's no humor in it, only a few laughs and the laughs went to those Spanish conversations only. Even the odds, I expected this film to be commercial success, receiving hundred of millions worldwide but it didn't hit $50 million. Well, I guess that's a joke, and I'm laughing at it.If the Golden Globes is generous enough, this film could be nominated for best motion picture - comedy or musical, I mean you can ask 'The Tourist' , it received negative reviews but still it could get 3 nominations. It's just sad, isn't it.Anyway, I rate this film 3/10 or largely negative review.betweentwofilms.blogspot.com",The Big Wedding

76,samfran94,I Now Pronounce You . . . An OK Movie.,6,12 June 2013,"If you're a stressed-out wedding planner, or a bride to be with cold feet then I'm gonna say this movie probably isn't one for you to watch in the build up to the big day. To anyone else on the other hand I would probably recommend it. Sure, I wouldn't rave about this movie, but that's not to say it is bad by any means. In my opinion it simply sells itself a little short.Director and writer Justin Zackham uses the classic 'sod's law' concept set around the premise of a traditional family wedding where everything that can goes wrong does go wrong, which has proved to be a winning formula numerous times in the past.This movie however only just scrapes the victory. In summary the movie follows young partners Melissa (Amanda Seyfried) and Alejandro (Ben Barnes) in the build up to their wedding, as we watch the hilarity unfold as their two families come together. The plot focuses on Alejandro's biological mother coming to the wedding, and how his adoptive parents, now divorced, must pretend to still be married in order to keep her strong Catholic views at bay.As you can imagine thus the madness begins to unfold as the whole family try to keep this secret, and others, under wraps, in a madcap clash of cultures, in-laws, siblings and religion. This film is not going to be winning Oscars any time soon, and I doubt it will go on to be hailed as 'one of the great comedies of its generation'. But, you have to admire it as a film that does exactly what it says on the tin. It's certainly a popcorn movie, and yeah OK granted it wasn't fantastic but I still found myself laughing and enjoying myself, which is all you really want from your run of the mill rom-com!My only complain would be that the all-star cast, including Robert DeNiro, Diane Keaton, Susan Sarandon, Topher Grace and Katherine Heigl just don't feel used to the best of their ability. With such a stellar cast this movie could perhaps have been a comedy for the ages. Yet, Amanda Seyfried feels underused as an A-List actress, and Robin Williams, although still funny, does not reach his comic potential as the priest.I wouldn't say I'd put people off viewing this movie, it does have quite a punchy script with some genuinely funny lines and comic moments, most of which include DeNiro whom I love as a comedic actor! It's just on paper I think I expected a little bit more, from a movie that could have delivered so much! Still, it's a nice casual watch when you're looking for a laugh and something not too serious on a night-in, particularly for the punch to the nose (I won't say who) which in my opinion is the best part of the movie.",The Big Wedding
77,gedachtniskirche,The big idiocy,2,26 July 2013,"I had to watch the «Big Wedding». because I did not miss any movie with Robert De Niro. My expectations for this film, were not deceived, because I don't expect anything good from typical American «wedding» comedies. The venerable and famous actors' starring only aggravated the sad impression. The director allegedly just in case secured himself against the possible failure, having invited the Hollywood «mastodons». Paying a tribute to their talents, the audience will bashfully clench the prepared tomatoes in palms, without having decided on sweeping bombing. Saying, the appearance of stars of the first magnitude will throw dust into gullible spectator's eyes, dispose to goodwill beforehand.In that cases I am surprised by unscrupulousness of popular and skilled actors, whose long time experience and professional actor's sharpness would certainly signal them about a possible failure. Robert De Niro, Diane Keaton and Susan Sarandon may not fear for sure to be a back numbers and forgotten. In short, they have no reason to grab the dubious roles for the sake of any opportunity to remind the audience about themselves. Therefore, cunning Justin Zackham seduced them with any unknown promises.The movie is pattern and predictable throughout. Frequently happens, that obsession with creation of an original and witty plot goes through the roof by it's excessiveness and fanaticism, and all the creative power is spent on this senseless rage. Therefore the laborious and rotten project turns out. Despite all the efforts of the Director to try very hard, forcing actors to juggle with extravagant dialogs and spark with firm charm, the sophisticated audience, overcoming a yawn, even at 5 frames knows the further development of the action's scene.Once again American culture shamelessly showed us the irrepressible craziness on sex, framed in a framework of sad and shaky humor with a claim for a piquancy. Obscene comments, ambiguous jokes and vulgar pun play on words, risky teetering on the brink of «scatological», compel the face muscles to portray only poor excuse for grin.And, unfortunately, this is not that case, when the star cast rescues the movie from a deafening failure. We can enjoy the playing of Robert De Niro, Diane Keaton, Susan Sarandon and Robin Williams with pleasure, focusing our perception exclusively on their charisma and talent, as if they played thematic sketches before the public. Such authoritative actors can be quite silent on the screen, and we will be delighted with expressiveness of their silence. We'll never see the poor and unconvincing playing from them. And if the bright and comedy actors' images in «Big Wedding» by no means can't be a merit of the director, so it would be unfair to award this movie even with the minimum praise for only cast.It's even strange that it happened. It's possible to spread out widely and fancifully in the genre of a «wedding theme"". And all the more so for remake's creation you can take into account the flaws and omissions of the «original», modify the script with more witty humor and directing finds. Then you're not ashamed to invite such well-known actors. And the director, in spite of his diligent efforts, so shamefully fumbled: spoiled the decent philosophical idea with so primitive and sluggish giving.",The Big Wedding

It seems people dislike this movie because they found it not-funny and somehow offensive. I strongly disagree.
It is a nice story about people, who have real feelings, contradictions; people who makes mistakes, and have to come to terms with that. It is a fun movie, if you are willing to laugh at yourself. It's even great at times, if you can enjoy the irony of life.
It is NOT a typical Hollywood comedy, it feels more like a british movie at times. It doesn't play for the big laughs, it doesn't go for the over-the-top performances. You won't get Robin Williams' comedic faces, or DeNiro's eyebrow trick. It's just a fun, enjoyable story about people.",The Big Wedding
82,rogus2006,The Big Feel Good,7,10 September 2020,"Susan Sarandon, Diane Keaton, Robert DeNiro, and the late Robin Williams are marvelous in their roles and still ""got it going on"" to make you feel good. There are only a couple issues with The Big Wedding, written and directed by Justin Zackhman. For example, this movie is a big ""white"" in set-decoration and characters. The story does include about 25% diversity with Latino characters but sadly, no authentic Latino actors. It's not that they didn't try. An important character to the story is the adopted son Alejandro who was born in Columbia (real life British actor, Ben Barnes) and his biological mother from Columbia (Patricia Rae, US born and Columbian descent) & sister from Columbia (Ana Ayora, US born and Miami native). Patricia Rae is the closest we get to actor diversity. If you can forget all that, the issues raised in the story connect well with the audience because the sexuality is real, and the characters are believable - outlandish at times - but believable. My only other issue is that one scene is out of order after an intimate event between the DeNiro & Keaton characters. The next morning, the couple presents Alajandro with a meaningful wedding gift that began a long time ago and connects them emotionally. Th gift is the soul of the movie and no doubt will inspire real-life engaged couples to replicate. The problem with this scene is the next time we see DeNiro is at the wedding where he obviously fell-off-the-wagon. Wait, he was fine that morning and suddenly he's tormented. It's too much of an emotional shift, isn't it? The abrupt emotional shift within only a few hours could, but probably wouldn't happen in real life. Isn't it better that the DeNiro & Keaton's characters present the gift to Alajandro, go to the rehearsal dinner, have the sexual conflict, and then be tormented playout better logically? None the less, Katherine Heigl (Knocked Up), Amanda Seyfried (Mamma Mia, 2008), Topher Grace (That 70s Show) and Kyle Bornheimer (Marriage Story) help make the story come alive. Feel good endings are more important than ever because of the current pandemic, wildfires, inequality, and political climate. And The Big Wedding delivers a good ending. My husband and I laughed throughout the movie and we liked the happy, feel good ending that includes all the characters. With my husband related to the family values, issues raised, characters, actors, and the story and we wish there were more stories with this demographic appeal, but with diverse actors as well as characters. Shamelessly I will add that The Big Wedding reminds me of a Screenplay I wrote with Sarandon and Keaton in mind - in my dreams, I know. We watched on Netflix; September 8, 2020.",The Big Wedding

It's not entirely the fault of the cast - and it really is an all-star cast - but I have to wonder what they thought they were getting into when they agreed to the script. I suppose they did what they could with the vapid story, which pretends to be about family struggles, but is mostly about over-privileged males gratifying themselves sexually. In one subplot, it's supposed to be sweet and innocent, but comes off creepy. And in another, it's just creepy. Hey, but at least everybody gets laid...If the director wanted a rom-com, then a few moments of genuine pathos would have been warranted. There are at best a couple of obligatory flat attempts to make us care. If the movie is supposed to be a farce or a spoof then it doesn't go far enough because it doesn't have any sense of humor about itself. And if the movie is supposed to be a sex comedy, then it's neither sexy nor funny. Instead, we're left with a bunch of disjointed formulaic noise that's supposed to be entertaining because it's lewd, or because it pretends to be the way ""real"" (or is that just really rich) families are. Hint to the director - Judd Apatow's movies aren't funny just because they're (oftentimes) crude. The audience has to care something about the characters, and part of that caring is making them and their situations something the viewer can relate to, even if they're not believable.If you're a fan of the cast members, do yourself a favor and skip this one; you'll like them less after you see it.",The Big Wedding

I've only seen 2 movies that are worse than this (one is 'Damage' and the other was so forgettable that I've actually forgotten what it was). There are innumerable movies that are 'so bad they're good' but this is just 'so bad it's terrible'. I realised that I'd made a terrible mistake as the name of the movie appeared on screen. It hadn't struck me until that moment that 'The Big Wedding' is such an unimaginative title (yes, there is a wedding, but what's big about it?). The worst thing about the movie is its total lack of wit, which seems to be a recurring symptom of the malady affecting recent movies (e.g. The Hangover Part III is similarly afflicted but it's Citizen Kane in comparison to The Big Wedding). The best/only gag in the movie is the 'Happy Ending' bit but the relevant circumstances are just not credible. The small screen seems to be where all the American talent is at the moment - 30 seconds of Californication is funnier, more romantic, better written, better paced, better edited, just better than the whole of this appalling mess.

The writers treat the sons birth mother's Catholicism as something that is foreign to American society. Diane Keaton's tone in describing pre-cana as that ""Catholic thing"" was mildly insulting. I went through pre-cana and what the Catholic church is trying to do there is to make sure that the betrothed are ready for what is ahead.

108,almavro,Great black comedy,10,26 September 2013,"It's hard for me to understand the number of negative comments here, unless puritanism has swamped the USA and drowned all humor with it.This is a slice-of-life black comedy that touches a number of nerve endings, inviting us to laugh at the same time. I won't ruin the anticipation but will say that I nearly choked on my popcorn over the opening de Niro/Sarandan/Keaton scene, which has to rank as an all-time classic. Certainly, some of the characters are a bit shallow (as - ahem! - one finds in real life), but there are so many plots and sub-plots that the movie can be excused for not developing them all within the space of 80-odd minutes.Don't get me wrong: I'm not talking Fellini, here. But I am talking superb, diverting entertainment -- what I look for in a movie.",The Big Wedding
109,djfrederick,I thoroughly enjoyed it!,6,11 August 2013,"I actually thoroughly enjoyed watching this film.I didn't expect, nor did I care, much for the storyline when I first added the film to my watchlist over a month ago, since what could a story possibly matter, when you're working with actors and actresses of such caliber? To my own amusement; a great story didn't/wouldn't matter.I'm 18 years old, but I cannot express how amazing I think the cast is. The combination of Robert De Niro, Diane Keaton, Susan Sarandon and Robin Williams is a match made in heaven - I only needed Meryl Streep to finish off the streak of top-class, aging actors.Topher Grace was surprisingly one of the funniest actors in the film and was perfect for his role as Jared. Katherine Heigl is always great to watch and the couple, Amanda Seyfried and Ben Barnes, didn't disappoint either. De Niro had some excellent moments throughout the film, and so did Keaton and Sarandon. Williams was well incorporated, and was perfect for his role. The swearing and bawdy scenes was directed in a proper and enjoyable manner, and to be fair, was what made this comedy somewhat original.Overall; the writing was witty, the story was entertaining, but still somewhat redundant, and the cast was impeccable - that's what carried the film.",The Big Wedding
110,DonFelix78,"Predictable, lazy comedy",3,7 June 2013,"This gentle comedy may prove too tame for a younger crowd, whilst perhaps being too vulgar for its, presumably older target audience. One therefore wonders just who will be taking this very predictable comedy to their hearts. A very lazy effort indeed, from the moment the story unfold, you know exactly where it is going. I laughed only once or twice during a thankfully short 89 minutes. It may be one of the better Columbia/America cross cultural misunderstanding films of the past few years, and probably De Niro's best work since Rocky and Bullwinkle, but the only saving grace for me was the aesthetic appeal of Ana Ayora. I had to watch Raging Bull when I got back from seeing this to remind myself that Robert De Niro used to make great films.",The Big Wedding
111,gsellwood,The worst film I have seen in 2013,1,26 October 2013,"I like many others here was swayed by the heavy weight cast and instead of my usual pre-view check-in at IMDb simply hit 'buy'. We regretted it within 15 minutes.Someone on this critic forum suggests that the humour hinges on whether you are prudish or not, that is drivel. The so called sexual humour was simply unfunny prudish or not. In fact the whole film was unfunny.I kept wondering if this film were seeking to make a point about US societal prudishness, looking under the veneer of social convention - but no! Was it seeking to examine religious bigotry? The staunch catholic who turns out to have been just as lacking in fidelity as the rest of the group. I don't think it was that either - as my co-viewer said, ' it was not that clever, it was just crap'.Save your pay per view money!",The Big Wedding
112,greenzirconia-513-585149,Great actors...but...,4,27 May 2013,"I would have been more impressed, probably, if it wasn't so long and drawn-out. Waiting for the end and eating over-buttered popcorn wasn't really what I was hoping for with a night out at the movies. There are some major wonderful actors in there, but the plot wasn't really all that laughable. I should have gone to see Iron Man. Robert Downey Jr. would have been funny....I just have never seen him playing a dull movie role. It was not a ""terrible"" movie, just dull. Not the comedy I expected. Without the laughs I expected either. The last part of the movie was cute, however, so you should wait until the movie is on sale for rental instead of paying the eight bucks to see it and the 10 dollars for a bag of popcorn.",The Big Wedding
113,crossroadsxdemon,Awkward with a capital A,6,30 April 2013,"Over all the movie was a bit of a disappointment even though I've been looking forward to seeing it for quite some time (Not for the big A- list case either), Rather I was looking forward to seeing the Talents of Ben Barnes back on the big screen. I wasn't disappointed in that regard. His portrayal of Alejandro was brilliant, his American accent was exact and his Spanish was impressive as well. I thought Al and Missy were adorable, but the movie itself had way too much going on. Just when you thought the story line couldn't get any crazier something stupider happened and by the end it was hard to keep everything that was going on straight. It had endearing and sweet family moments that were really it's only saving grace. If you had cut out half the random story lines and the random awkward sexual parts that...for the record did not add to the plot line, it would have been a great movie but as usual a potentially good film is ruined with crude comedy. That being said some of the story lines that had been supplemented by crude comedy were amusing story lines but were sort of ruined.",The Big Wedding
114,frollgorston,Shallow,1,27 April 2013,"Despite including big name stars, this movie has no redeeming value. There is no discernible plot and the script is poorly written. It's almost as if the writer(s) got stuck early in the story and said, ""Okay, let's throw in an unrelated sex joke here."" This was repeated over and over throughout the movie. I don't understand how the producer or the actors could have read the script and thought this would possibly be a watchable movie. The premise of the story COULD have been a real winner if it had been adequately written, but it wasn't. The script has the feel of a school book report written the night before it was due, hastily and without much thought. There was no depth to even a single character. Even the best talent (actors, director, DP, etc.) can only do so much with such a shallow and barely usable script. Unfortunately, in spite of their combined talent, they couldn't drag this one from the trash bin of easily forgettable films no matter how hard they tried.",The Big Wedding
115,derza77,What a waste of actors' and viewers' time!,2,29 April 2013,"My wife suggested we go see this movie, after all, you have to work really hard to spoil something with De Niro, Keaton and Robin Williams in it, right?Well, apparently not. Just throw together a completely meaningless plot, fill it with a couple awkward sexual scenes, remove any hint of real feeling or nuance, and then fill what's left with numerous clichés that are worthy of a B porno flick - and you will get some idea of what ""The Big Wedding"" is like.It's another one in the long and sadly ever-growing line of Hollywood fiascoes, built on the premise that it's enough to throw together a bunch of star actors to get a blockbuster. It's not. The feeling you get is that the film's budget was spent on securing the big hitters, and then a couple of hundred bucks that were left were given to some sex-obsessed teenager in high school, to write the plot. As a result, this movie which claims to be a comedy, is a farce, a farce of what a comedy should be. After watching for a little over an hour, I left without finishing it. It was super boring, predictable and entirely unimpressive. Don't waste your time watching this grotesque concoction of nothing.",The Big Wedding
116,wukb36,Absolutely terrible,1,29 April 2013,"For full disclosure, I don't like these kind of movies. I only watch them when my wife asks me too. While I don't like these kinds of movies, there have been movies like this that while I did not enjoy, I could see why it was a good movie, be it in the script, acting, story, etc., so I am not totally biased. That being said, this movie sucked. Yes, most movies are fiction, but there has to be some sort of believability with the plot and interactions among the characters. This had none of that. It was a bad script along with unfunny sex jokes. I know I know, I must be a prude because I didn't find the sex jokes funny right? Ehh wrong. People like to say: ""you are prude/offended if you didn't find the sex/racist jokes funny."" I read it all the time. The bottom line is that they just weren't funny. It had nothing to do with the subject matter, it was just lack of thought and effort.",The Big Wedding
117,myraflynn7,A big disappointment.,2,9 May 2013,"I had high hopes for this movie. Having seen Crazy Stupid Love and being surprised with its wit, good script and sophisticated humour I thought The Big Wedding might be a similar kind of film. I was so wrong. It has the makings of a great little comedy but falls down badly. Why such an experienced, talented group of actors would agree to take part in this film is beyond my comprehension. Susan and Diane surely know better. Perhaps they are trying to impart a message that 'older' people are still enjoying great sex lives, well this is not the way to get that message across and fails miserably in my opinion. A total waste of talent here unfortunately. Since I did not manage to stay until the end of the film I cannot judge if it improved in the second half - 45 minutes was enough for me. But I paid my money to enter the cinema which will be included in the takings and no doubt show a good result. Not justified in any way. I will try to keep a note of the script writer and avoid their work in future.",The Big Wedding
118,cozycreekbedandbreakfast,sad,1,23 May 2013,"Very disappointing, this was completely void of any moral decorum what so ever...even for Hollywood. This was a careless piece of work...but the movie made it perfectly OK to act like cheating, lying, adultery, lack of consideration for others, was perfectly acceptable... sign of the times...I found it sad to say the least that some of Hollywood's top actors and actresses, not only signed up for this, but obviously condoned the behavior, and after all they are the worlds role models. Call me old fashion, but I really think they could have done without every single joke being sexually based.

I asked my wife if she was enjoying it, we decided to leave after about 50 minutes into the movie.I actually felt bad for the actors.

We are a big audience, we like to spend money, if only there's a film worth seeing. This one is a film worth seeing.There is plenty to amuse a younger audience, if they can handle how their own behaviour comes across, the 29 year old virgin, the pregnant daughter and her absent man, the south American honey.

Who wants to see Susan Sarandon's bandy legs in the air? Yuch. Also, Robert D and Dianne Keaton used to be in grade A movies..they have really sunken. If a lot of people found this to be a good movie then the left is successful in pushing their immoral lifestyle and taste (yes I said it) on the rest of us. The movie is also pretty typical of contemporary entertainment. Have writers of screen, music, etc. become so immersed in technology that real talent has fallen by the wayside? Contemporary culture has spawned so much insipid Hollywood drivel that no wonder people don't go to the movies anymore.",The Big Wedding

He managed to make a film, that was able to tarnish the professional history of such beautiful actors as Robert de Niro, Susan Sarandon, Robin Williams and Diane Keaton. So platitudinous, vulgar, cheerless and superficial - just an exemplary shame of cinematography.I wonder, what were those forces of nature, that made all these decent actors become involved in such a screenplay under such a direction. I wonder, if there are any forces of nature in American expert community, that are able to interrupt a production of such a disgraceful sample prior to its promulgation. So, if you don't want to waste your time on watching a pageant of everybody's shame, don't touch this movie.",The Big Wedding
124,amypozzar,Justin Zackham's 2013 comedy showcases a stellar cast but fails to deliver a performance and plot to suit,4,13 May 2014,"'The Big Wedding': don't RSVPJustin Zackham's 2013 comedy showcases a stellar cast but fails to deliver a performance and plot to suitSkimming through the thousands of films on Netflix, one can't help but come to a halt at the sight of the all-star cast of 'The Big Wedding'. With Robert De Niro, Diane Keaton, Susan Sarandon and Robin Williams just to name a few, this comedy looks promising; if not for laughs, at least for easy watching with familiar faces.The film is a remake of the 2006 French film Mon Frère Se Marie (My Brother is Getting Married) written by Jean-Stéphane Bron and Karine Sudan. 'The Big Wedding', directed by Justin Zackham, marries elements of the romantic comedy and comedy-drama hybrid genres. The film is based around Ellie (Diane Keaton) and Don's (Robert De Niro) adopted Columbian son Alejandro (Ben Barnes) who is getting married. The 'twist' manifests when Alejandro reveals that his biological mother, Madonna (Patricia Rae) is coming to the wedding, and being the devout Catholic that she is, he says she will never forgive him or his adopting parents for divorcing years ago. So naturally when a romantic comedy crosses with a comedy drama, Alejandro's solution is to ask Ellie and Don to pretend to be still married while his mother is visiting from Columbia, resulting in chaos. Bebe (Susan Sarandon), Don's long-term partner, leaves the house upset at the situation, mostly that Don hasn't proposed after eight years, while Don and Ellie tackle feigning their happy marriage throughout the film. While far-fetched story lines make for some of the best films, this one borders so unrealistic that it verges on to childish. With award-winning actors and a standard budget of $35 million, the film's potential is held back by the unbelievable plot that relishes in characters and scenarios we've seen times before.To start off, there's Nuria (Ana Ayora), Alejandro's half-sister from Columbia who is visiting with her mother. Unlike the rest of the female characters, being the foreigner that she is, Nuria is presented as a brainless, sexual object right from the beginning. In the company of a lust-interest, she suggests they go swimming, and before he can say 'swimsuit', she has stripped off and dives into the water butt-naked at the family residence. As all female foreigners do, right? While Ellie tries to change the South American seductress' views by telling her she ""deserves to be treated with respect"", in the end, Zackham proves that she just cannot deny her innate overtly sexual tendencies. Then there is Don and pretty much every other male in the film who are all dealing with one of two (if not both) of clearly life's biggest problems: sex and marriage. If they're not remorselessly cheating, they're desperately wooing with one thing in mind; and if they're not getting any, it's because ""they should've proposed by now, duh!""Despite its predictability, 'The Big Wedding' does get some points for trying to stand out amongst the plethora of comedy dramas and rom-coms. While the genre typically promotes a 'love conquers all' message, this film looks beyond conventional themes and also asserts the importance of acceptance and freedom of choice in the new age, covering topics such as homosexuality and religion. Zackham's satirical take on religion and the Catholic Church underlines most of the film's humour, which is a pleasant step away from the typical consistent toilet-humor or gender- specific jokes. There is also a shift from traditional romantic-drama comedies focusing on the young, beautiful, and sexy. Instead, 'The Big Wedding' focuses largely on the sexual lives of the older generations: their accounts, their challenges and their affairs. A smug ""forty minutes, baby"" and a sleazy wink is the last thing you'd expect to see Robert De Niro doing in this film. But trust that you will see it, you will definitely hear 'it', and for the first time in your life you may find yourself wanting to tell good old Rob to just shut the hell up because no one likes a bragger. There, feel better? You can stop cringing now.Overall, 'The Big Wedding' checks all the romantic-drama comedy boxes. After all, it is lighthearted, and it does provide some laughs. Hearing Diane Keaton drop the C-bomb is unbelievably refreshing, and who would expect to see De Niro, Sarandon and cunnilingus- in theory and in practice- all incorporated in the first ten of the 89-minute film?But disappointingly, with its simple-minded storyline and some real cringe-worthy stereotypes, the 'The Big Wedding' just doesn't ooze the same stellar quality like that of the cast. Perhaps Zackham's next romantic-drama comedy film could aim to see the women defined by more than a mere quest for marriage and the men driven by something other than sex. To avoid disappointment, don't let the cast fool you; definitely not a film for the kids or fans of De Niro pre-2000s. If you're after a (very) lighthearted film and after you've watched every other film on Netflix, then this one could be, maybe, possibly be for you. The film does entertain to a certain degree but it's one you probably won't watch again and won't feel bad for downloading illegally*. *I actually do not condone piracy of films.",The Big Wedding

I'm no prude & sexual jokes can be funny but all of them in this movie just came off as dumb and awkward. I didn't really like the characters either. Plus it was offensive to other cultures at times also. I like Katherine Heigel (sp) but she was so un likable in this movie. Bland, bitter & just whatever. I'm from Colombia and soooo much of this was just wrong. For one, its not that easy for Colombian citizens to get visas to leave the country. Two, Colombian adoptions aren't like in the US where the biological mother just signs her child over to a willing couple. Just doesn't happen. At any rate, don't waste your time.
