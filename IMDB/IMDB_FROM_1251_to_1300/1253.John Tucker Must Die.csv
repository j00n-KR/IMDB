0,bkoganbing,He's Broken Their Hearts,4,21 March 2013,"Jesse Metcalfe current good guy hunk on the new Dallas and previously of Desperate Housewives stars as a high school heartthrob in John Tucker Must Die. Not that anyone is planning to actually murder him, but four'girls decide to take him down several pegs. That occurs when three of them actually discover that they're dating him as his one and only at the same time and the fourth just observes and crushes out on him.That fourth one is Brittany Snow and it's she that the others, Ashanti, Sophia Bush, and Arielle Kebbel settle on to be the instrument of his downfall. He's broken their collective hearts and he's got to pay.If you've seen any number of teen oriented flicks than you know exactly how this one will end up. Not since Beverly Hills 90210 have so many 20 something players got cast in high school roles. This is led by the star himself who is a great looking 28 year old when he did this film in 2006, but still looking 28. One of the things they do to Metcalfe is spike his sports drink with estrogen that one of the girls is taking to enhance her bosoms, not that any really needed it. And the macho basketball star begins showing some out of character behavior as such. Which by the way he does turn to his advantage.I'm sure at one time I might have found this much funnier. But I've come to know any number of male to female transgender people who take estrogen to change their very sexual identities and believe me a gag like that loses its humor quickly. It even caused me to drop my star rating on this venue.So don't expect too much from John Tucker Must Die unless you are below 18 or a die-hard Jesse Metcalfe fan.",John Tucker Must Die
1,SnoopyStyle,Silly Little Comedy,5,31 December 2013,"Kate (Brittany Snow) is an awkward invisible teen with a hot mom (Jenny McCarthy). John Tucker (Jesse Metcalfe) is the rich captain of the basketball team, and a real player off the court. When all the girls are forced into the same PE, it comes out that everybody (Ashanti, Sophia Bush, Arielle Kebbel) is dating John Tucker. The three girls enlist Kate into their schemes for revenge.It's a silly little comedy. I stress the silly, and downplay the comedy. The jokes don't really work. It doesn't have anything real. The girls are perfectly nice. Maybe that's the rub. There isn't any edge to the humor. They're not taking any chances.",John Tucker Must Die
2,Prismark10,Lady diet,4,22 August 2016,"John Tucker Must Die is a passable romantic comedy that lacks satirical bite and the courage of its convictions. Jesse Metcalfe is John Tucker the high school basketball star and heartthrob who is dating three girls simultaneously. They are Heather the cheerleader (Ashanti) Carrie (Arielle Kebbel) and Beth (Sophia Bush.) Kate Spencer (Brittany Snow) is the new girl who is always moving town from town as her hot mother goes from one unsuitable boyfriend to another. Kate is invisible, no one notices her. It is her who suggests that the three girls should get revenge on John Tucker and show him the error of his ways. The girls decide that Kate should be the one who breaks his heart and attempt to maker desirable despite her inexperience with men. She also gets friendly at high school with John's other brother Scott who is less sexy.Of course you never for a moment buy Kate as invisible as she is rather appealing played Brittany Snow. The story should had been more darkly wicked but it is just inoffensively bland but charming.",John Tucker Must Die
3,gavin6942,"This Falls Into that ""Guilty Pleasure"" Category",6,11 August 2008,"A group of high school girls have had their hearts broken by basketball star John Tucker (Jesse Metcalfe). So what to do? What ensues, besides hilarity, is a series of pranks and the big payback: send in a new girl to break his heart. But can she get past his charm and walk away before he strikes yet again? I didn't watch the entire show because I caught it on television, but I saw enough to get the overall flavor of this one. And what I was left wondering is: who is the target audience here? At first I figured it was high school girls, but soon I found the film ripping on them just as much as taking their side. This is not a female empowerment movie. I'm a guy and I've been out of high school almost ten years, yet I found the film watchable and a little bit fun.What really got me through this was Arielle Kebbel, who I have a big crush on for all the wrong reasons (don't tell anyone). She was looking fine, more fine than in ""Grudge 2"" (though not quite as fine as in ""American Pie: Band Camp""). The other actors and actresses were okay as well, though none of them stood out as being overly talented or particularly gorgeous. This is a teen movie, talent is optional.I liked the pranks and how they backfired. I liked the idea of setting up the ""plain"" friend with the jock -- remember ""She's All That""? There's a lot of good stuff going on in this movie that I wouldn't mind giving it a second viewing. If I'm ever flipping through channels (something I rarely do) and see this on, I'm probably going to stop. So, thanks film-makers. Not sure who your target audience was, but if it was me, you hit a bullseye. And I don't even think I'm ashamed of it.",John Tucker Must Die
4,jboothmillard,John Tucker Must Die,4,26 October 2009,"It might have had a catchy title, but I don't think I was expecting that much from the film itself, from director Betty Thomas (Doctor Dolittle). Basically John Tucker (Desperate Housewives' Jesse Metcalfe) is the handsome, popular, player and talented student of the high school, and he is also a serial cheater. He has recently managed to fool Heather (singer Ashanti), Beth (Sophia Bush) and Carrie (American Pie Presents Band Camp's Arielle Kebbel) into believing they are all his girlfriend. Kate (Brittany Snow) is always moving because of her mother Lori (Razzie nominated Jenny McCarthy) and her many short relationships with not very nice men, so she doesn't have friends, and is not known or popular with people, until she meets these three girls. They all decide that John Tucker should pay for all the heartbreak and humiliation he has caused, they first try humiliating him, which doesn't work. They know the only way to get to him and make him ""undateable"" is by combining the personalities and traits of the three girls into Kate to make him fall in love with her, and cause really bad heartbreak at the end of it. The plan seems to be going well while she plays heard to get, he looks quite desperate at times, but slowly she is realising she is not being herself and the girls are too influential. Also, in Kate's mother is concerned for her well being, and so is the guy that she obviously be with, John's younger and less sexy brother Scott (Penn Badgley). Don't worry, the truth comes out at John's big birthday bash, like the original plan had intended, John never lied again, Scott and Kate were happy together, and the three girls and her remained friends, in fact, everyone knew about Kate in the end. Snow is a very pretty lead, the three female co-stars are good at being bitchy, and I will admit there were some amusing moments, it isn't really original social satire and great teen comedy, but it's alright. Okay!",John Tucker Must Die
5,anaconda-40658,John Tucker Must Fire His Agent.,2,19 August 2015,"John Tucker Must Die (2006): Dir: Betty Thomas / Cast: Jesse Metcalfe, Brittany Snow, Sophia Bush, Ashanti Douglas, Penn Badgley: Stupid teen comedy about revenge. High school basketball player John Tucker is dating three women at once without them knowing it. Only waitress Kate seems to notice since she has waited on their tables. When the truth reveals itself they plot revenge by turning Kate into a cheerleader to break his heart. Mean Girls is so much better and funnier than this cheap trash. Total formula with an insincere ending. Directed by Betty Thomas who once made the great Howard Stern comedy Private Parts. This is a major decline of quality. She knows her subject but chooses mediocre projects that compare to earlier misfires such as I Spy and Doctor Dolittle. Jesse Metcalfe as Tucker is never likable, and Brittany Snow is suppose to be seen as a nerd until they whore her up. Sophia Bush and Ashanti Douglas play dumped girls. Its theme of taking advantage of people and retaliation was better placed in the superior Mean Girls. Penn Badgley plays John Tucker's brother who is the nice one who will get the girl in the end. What he doesn't get is a decent film role here. This is totally phony teen trash aimed at teenage girls who are no doubt smarter than this. But John Tucker should not be the one to die here. The film should die from several blows via sledgehammer. Score: 2 / 10",John Tucker Must Die
6,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: John Tucker Must Die,6,16 September 2006,"John Tucker Must Die has one of the most interesting trailers for a commercial cheesy girly flick, and it works to a certain extent, with the similarity in playing along the same lines as the Kill Bill title. I remember vividly each time after the trailer was aired, that some girls seated around me will almost always squeal with delight, so it's really no wonder if this flick proves to do well at the box office.The good looking girls in school always capitalize on their assets to snag that one hot alpha male guy, and who else than John Tucker (Jesse Metcalfe, the famous gardener from Desperate Housewives), captain of the school basketball team wearing that number 23 jersey, and with deep pockets lined with cash too? John's a serial player, and his conquests of the sexy one Beth (Sophia Bush), the brainy one Carrie (Arielle Kebbel) and the lead cheerleader with attitude Heather (Ashanti) left them with bad aftertaste after they found out about him dating them simultaneously. His technique? They belong to different cliques (guys take note), and his sweet nothings were easily bought into. I thought they made good tips too, ha!Anyway they find out his rouse, and get all riled up in seeking revenge, enlisting the help of protagonist Kate Spencer (Brittany Snow), an unknown in school, now having the opportunity to become a legend by helping the girls turn the tables on John. While the girls are all sugar and spice and all things nice, they sure live up to the saying that hell knows no fury like a woman, or here, 3 women, scorned. They have their antics, but the power of the alpha male is to turn each bad situation around through their aura of incredible luck. At times though the movie seemed to lack focus and want to cover too much ground in too little time, having Kate jump right out of the pages of Never Been Kissed (1999), and subplots involving budding romances, and romances for real.Despite being a popcorn flick, it did try to insert a moral message within its eye candy scenes, and that is a reminder to all in relationships, that we're dealing with real feelings and emotions with real people here, and it always hurts. Honesty goes a long way, and as a word of caution, those who go after a John Tucker, should already know what they're in for. On a side note, it also looks at how one should always be aware if you're not staying true to yourself, of being the creation of someone else and the leveraging on others to gain popularity.That aside, the way to approach this teen movie is to sit back, relax, and put your brains to idle mode. In typical fashion, it's full of pop songs to entice teenagers, and stay tune through the end credits for a small scene inserted in between.",John Tucker Must Die
7,whpratt1,Great Entertainment for Everyone,6,20 December 2008,"Kate, (Brittany Snow) is a young girl who left another small town because her mother was heart broken over a love affair and Kate finds herself in another high school where she really plays the role as a wall-flower who is not known by anyone.Kate sits back and watches how the girls in the high school have their interests in one guy named John Tucker, (Jesse Metcalfe) who manages to charm different girls each day of the week and does a good job of breaking their hearts. John is one of the most popular student with great sports skills and was involved in almost every popular event in the school.Kate decides to tell a few girls who were hurt in romantic relationships with John Tucker and she shows them a way to get even with him and turn the table on all his lies and promises.There is lots of laughs and this story is good for both adults and the young. Enjoy.",John Tucker Must Die
8,Smells_Like_Cheese,Did anyone else know a John Tucker?,6,12 August 2006,"The only reason I wanted to see this movie was because I knew a John Tucker in high school, not only that, but I dated him. We're still friends now, but he still talks about all the girls he is dating simultaneously. So, I naturally thought this was a documentary about him. :D Well, I'm kidding. This did look like a crappy movie, therefore I did not want to see this flick. It looked like your typical teen movie and cheesy predictable plot.Yeah, it had that, but I think in some strange way it offered more. I'm just at least seeing something a little more in this flick. Yeah, it had your typical stereotypical teens, and you could predict everything that would happen in the next scene. But still I think in it's own special way, this will win teens over. I don't think this is a bad movie. You have got to admit that you got a good laugh out of John Tucker trying on the lady's underwear, well, you'll have to see it to understand.6/10",John Tucker Must Die
9,blanbrn,Your typical teenage sex-driven hormone flick.,5,31 January 2007,"""John Tucker Must Die"" I guess is fun and watchable, it takes a viewer back to their high school days. Our high school days is a time we all remember with the pretty girls, power jocks, shyness, and nerds and everyone trying to be the most popular. Well this film has a little bit of it all as Jesse Metcalfe from ""Desperate Housewives"" fame stars as a high school hunk who's the school's basketball star and resident stud. The Metcalfe character is a real ladies man having three girlfriends at once only to keep it concealed from each, so boy a trio of hearts are broken when this creep is exposed! These three hurt ladies bond together and they get a new student named Kate(Brittany Snow) who's new on the block with her charm and innocent looks to go after the hot young stud only to break his heart and make him learn love in the end. During the plan some of the stuff is so immature and childish like putting estrogen hormones in his sports drink, and all of of the spying and lies told are crazy. Overall this movie isn't really interesting because the plot is so childish, but the eye candy keeps it fresh for a look. Finally the eye candy is worth a mention any film that has Sophia Bush, Ashanti, Brittany Snow, and Jenny McCarthy(who plays the hot mother of Kate) is worth a watch for any man.",John Tucker Must Die
10,Robert_duder,Aims for the demographic and knocks it out of the ballpark...great movie!!,8,31 July 2006,"John Tucker Must Die is exactly what it presents itself to be. It doesn't try to hide behind a mysterious name or a false pretense. John Tucker Must Die is a film written, directed, and aimed directly at pre-teen/teen girls who want to watch good looking, popular girls get even with a guy who treats them wrong and that's exactly what you're going to get with this film. It's cute, well acted for what it is, well written, funny, and even heart warming at times. You've got four completely different girls from different cliques, opposite ends of the spectrum with one thing in common...a hatred for Mr. John Tucker. Tucker is the be all and end all of teenage boys. Good looking, cool, popular, the ultimate trend setter and completely unstoppable and a ferocious womanizer. So it takes the four girls to join powers to bring him down and it's fun to watch because Tucker really is a jerk and you don't feel sorry for anything they do to him. This film will be relatable to anyone who has ever wanted to bring someone down that was too big for their own good.Jesse Metcalfe, America's infamous Yard Boy, makes his feature film debut as John Tucker. Despite being 27 Tucker does play the popular teen heart-throb pretty well. He's basically an ass and yet you can't help but be drawn to the guy. Guys wanna be his friend and girls wanna...well yah he's popular. I don't know if this film will do anything for Metcalfe's career but teen girls will love him. Brittany Snow is remarkable. I really like her...I have since her Meg days on American Dreams, a show ended long before it's potential was tapped. So I was glad to see Snow get a decent role as the very down to earth and probably most relatable girl Kate. Kate feels completely invisible having been moved around by her serial dating Mom. Although Kate herself is inexperienced when it comes to people and men she has watched her Mom go through it time and time again and when the opportunity arises she offers to make Tucker pay!! I think this could give Snow a real boost into at the very least the teenie movies. She's still only 20 so she has a few years left of pretending to be a teenager and guys are still allowed to ogle her because she's legal. Ashanti plays head cheerleader Heather. She has some talent and although I don't think this is the film that really showcases it she does well and fits in fine. Sophia Bush plays vegan animal lover Beth who also happens to rather experienced in the sex department. She gets a lot of the really funny lines and funny scenes as well so she shines in this film. Her scene stuck in the back of Tucker's jeep is very funny. Arielle Kebbel does great as the uptight student council, involved in everything Carrie. Now of course Kebbel's big role was in American Pie's Band Camp where she did decently and this role isn't exactly a big stretch from that one, in fact it's nearly identical but if that is her calling then she does well in that role. And as I commented on Band Camp, she still bears an amazing resemblance to Mandy Moore. Penn Badgley who I knew from the short lived WB Series The Mountain, plays Tucker's brother, Scott. He's the underdog, the nice guy who seems to get overlooked. He's obviously fascinated with Kate and they are cute together, their casual banter. Badgley probably hits his max as far as acting range as he seems to have this character nailed. That being said he is good as the underdog and despite a flourishing romance in the end sadly we don't ever really see Kate and Scott get together. And finally worthy a mention is the small role of Kate's Mother played by Jenny McCarthy who is obviously getting quite mature in her later years. She has had some very decent, humorous, intelligent roles as of late and her performance as Kate's serial dating, and constantly getting hurt mom is very well done. Snow and McCarthy even look a little alike. Bravo to McCarthy for trying something different.Director Betty Thomas knows how to tell a very light and fluffy story. Consider that of Sandra Bullock's 28 Days, a serious story of Alcoholism told in such a funny, touching, often heart warming way. This is another example of Thomas telling a good story, with not a lot of depth but still very watchable and very easy to watch. Just something you can sit back, relax, enjoy, chuckle and not think a lot about but still be good!! John Tucker Must Die will not win any awards, it won't even raise too many eye brows but what it's worth it's a fun little movie that most will enjoy!! I did. 8/10",John Tucker Must Die
11,MLDinTN,"OK, for some silly laughs",6,4 June 2007,"This is a movie about high school girls getting even with the hottest guy in school, who happens to be dating all 3. The three girls team up with Kate, the new girl who is semi-hot but has yet to be noticed by everyone. They want Kate to date John and get him to fall in love and then break his heart. Kate also has some interest in John's older brother. The plan works a little to well because Kate starts to like John and not think he is such a bad guy. The girls play dirty tricks on John to try to embarrass him in front of the school. Some of the jokes are funny, but this was just a so-so movie. The idea is not something new.One flaw, every high school kid looked like they were in their mid 20s.FINAL VERDICT: OK, it has some funny parts, but I think it is definitely for the teen crowd.",John Tucker Must Die
12,callanvass,Amusing for a teen movie!,6,12 October 2014,"Kate (Brittany Snow) is the new girl in town! She is shocked to find out that John Tucker is dating three girls at once. She's also having trouble fitting in, and feels like an outcast. If that isn't enough, her Mother dates so many guys, Kate ends up calling everyone one of them Skippy. In a quest to make John Tucker undateable, Kate joins three of John's jilted exes to gradually erode John. Things go awry and Kate ends up falling for himThis movie is aimed squarely at teenagers. I'm an adult and I had a fairly enjoyable time with it! I knew what to expect going into this one. It never fails to amaze me at how many people criticize movies like these. What do you honestly expect? Think of it as Mean Girls, but not quite as good. v It reminded me somewhat of my days in High School! People wanna fit in so badly and do anything to do so. Obviously, they embellished a lot of things, but still. It does get to the point where you don't know who to side with after a while. John Tucker is a full-fledged womanizer, but he's still a human being. As juvenile and silly as it got near the end I still had a good time with it all. It's a typical, but solid message about responsibility and being yourself. Hurting others to get revenge won't make things all that better. It even throws in a bit of Pretty in Pink for good measure! Funniest scene is when Tucker overdoses on estrogen pills! That's a hoot. The attractive cast acquits themselves well. Brittany Snow is adorable! She hits all the right notes as Kate and carried the film. It shocked me a charming girl like her was single for so long in the movie. Jesse Metcalfe is solid as the womanizing jock. Females will go crazy for him! Ashanti, Sophia Bush & Arielle Kebbel are fun. Penn Badgley is a tad underdeveloped, but good in his role. Jenny McCarthy looks good and plays the Mom part adequately. It's no Mean Girls, but it's fairly fun anyway. Accept it for what it is, and I don't see why you can't have some fun with it. Have people really gotten this cynical over movies? Relax and enjoy! That's my advice6.2/10",John Tucker Must Die

14,Thanos_Alfie,Not much...,4,20 July 2021,"""John Tucker Must Die"" is a Comedy - Romance movie in which we watch the most famous boy on high school cheating his girlfriends. Three of them are trying to get revenge with the help of a new girl in order to make him fall in love with her and break his heart later on.I have to admit that I did not have high expectations from this movie so, I was not disappointed after watching it. I was expecting a boring teenage movie with a bit of romance and full of cliché moments and it was just like that. The interpretations of Jesse Metcalfe who played as John Tucker and Brittany Snow who played as Kate were average but their combination was good. The direction which was made by Betty Thomas was below average and she did not make us relate to her main characters and feel that we are part of her movie. Finally, I have to say that ""John Tucker Must Die"" is another teenage comedy movie that does not have anything new to add.",John Tucker Must Die
15,insomniac_rod,It delivers expectations : It entertains.,6,23 September 2006,"Following the well known humor in the style of ""American Pie""; ""John Tucker Must Die"" is a hilarious teen comedy. That's it. The only intention of the movie is to entertain. The situations are very predictable but fun. Audiences are getting used to these kind of movies where sex and sensuality are the main aspect. In ""John Tucker"", sex is the reason to watch this movie. Sex in all the sense of the word (situations, dialogs, scenes, jokes). Brittany Snow in lingerie, and the kiss between her and Sophia Bush are excellent scenes! The acting is very good. I was surprised with Brittany Snow's fresh, cute, and hilarious performance. The girl is up for big things. Also, Sophia Bush delivered a sexy, fun performance. She seemed to have fun with it. The rest of the cast is just okay.Watch this movie if you are in the mood to have fun and then, forget completely about the movie.I really dug the ending.

16,taylorkingston,Such a good movie...,10,8 June 2015,"I absolutely love this movie. It's so funny, the cast is amazing, and it is one of my all-time favorite movies.This movie is about a guy named John Tucker. At his High School he is the most popular, and the most athletic. Every guy wants to be him and every girl wants to be with him. Which is good for him, since he dates multiple girls at once. He dates girls from different cliques so they never talk to each other. He uses pet names so he doesn't mix their names up. One day, a new girl, Kate, is stuck in detention with three girls all fighting over John. Eventually, they team up to take John down. Kate becomes his new love-interest and then she's going to break his heart. But feelings may get in the way.Best part of the movie: When Kate and the girls are figuring out a way to destroy John.Worst part of the movie: When John climbs on the ledge of a building.Overall, I give this movie a 10 out of 10, which in my ratings book is: Freaking Ridonkulous.",John Tucker Must Die
17,lisafordeay,A very funny movie but its not the best film ever made.,6,19 November 2013,"So I seen this movie a couple of times before on TV so I decided to buy it on DVD a few days ago as it had Just My Luck(which sucks) and My Super Ex Girlfriend) with it. John Tucker Must Die tells the tale of 3 girls(played by Sophia Bush from One Tree Hill,Ashanti who was a former pop starlet and Arielle Kriebel from Aquamarine)who all have one thing in common,they all dated a guy called John Tucker(played by the gorgeous dude from Dallas Jesse Metcafe)who has a certain charisma with the ladies. But when a new girl called Kate(played by Hairspray star Brittney Snow)starts school,the 3 girls decide to use her to get back on the man that cheated on them so that Kate can cheat on him and pay him back for all the things he did to the 3 girls he cheated on.On top of that you've got hilarious moments with the 4 girls getting even with some hot dude.Overall this movie was actually not that bad,its been done to death of course over and over again but this is very funny stuff. My only concern was the title John Tucker MUST Die. I mean why not call it John Tucker Gets Revenge or whatever because frankly he DOESN'T DIE IN THE MOVIE seriously???Anyway from the director of Alvin & The Chipmunks and Dr Dolittle John Tucker Must Die is a funny teen comedy for those who love a good laugh.Overall I would give it a 6 and out of 5 a 3 out of 5.",John Tucker Must Die

19,dee.reid,"""John Tucker Must Die"" - Where ""Mean Girls"" left off",8,23 April 2007,"In ""John Tucker Must Die,"" three angry ex-girlfriends and a newbie plot the demise of their serial-cheating ex-boyfriend, the John Tucker of the title, who has no idea that they know his misdeeds and are out for blood. Alas, they don't plan to kill him or anything like that (although maybe the movie could have gotten away with such a heinous storyline, and thus be a little bit more original), but they plan to destroy his reputation - something that only receives an ""I'll leave you girls alone"" from a clueless mother.So yes, ""John Tucker Must Die"" is another teen movie. (Not Another Teen Movie!) After all, I watched ""Mean Girls"" (2004) three years ago and loved it, and it's now one of my all-time favorite movies. So, OK, why am I, a 21-year-old male, watching yet another teen movie that seems tailor-made for all the teenage girls out there who have been played by one too many serial heartbreaking boyfriends? Well, I had no choice, for one. It's a movie that I've wanted to see since last summer (when it first hit theaters) and after putting it off for a long time due to financial reasons, I gave the DVD (which contained the unrated extended version of the film) a whirl and was pleasantly surprised with a very funny, albeit typical teen movie.The film begins offbeat, in the same fashion as most Ugly Ducking teen movie tales: nerdy-girl Kate Spencer (Brittany Snow) is the daughter of single-mom Lori Spencer (Jenny McCarthy), who has a habit of bringing home one too many stray men. Kate has grown so accustomed to her mother's persistent heartbreak that she refers to every new man simply as ""Skip,"" as in he ""skips"" out of her mom's bedroom the next morning after a romantic rendezvous the night before. So it's no wonder why Kate can understand the situation so clearly when she discovers that John Tucker (""Desperate Housewives"" Jesse Metcalfe), the hottest, most popular guy in school and the star athlete, is cheating on not one, not two, but THREE different girls from each of the school's different cliques.That action begins when the three soon-to-be ex-girlfriends of John Tucker - cheerleader Heather (Ashanti), eco-conscious vegan activist Beth (Sophia Bush), and newsgirl Carrie (Arielle Kebbel) - meet head-on in gym class, an encounter that quickly escalates into a gymnasium brawl and the three getting detention together with Kate, after Kate intervenes and reveals John's infidelity. The four utilize their respective talents to plot the ultimate sabotage, everything from misshapen romantic encounters to Estrogen therapy for poor John. When each of these plans fail and only help to further John's reputation at school, that's when they decide to throw Kate to the wolves and give her a makeover. But can Kate successfully keep herself from falling for John's seductive charm and stick to the plan, or will she end up as just another revenge-crazy ex-girlfriend? Or will she give her heart to John's nice-guy younger brother Scott (Penn Badgley), the ""other Tucker""?""John Tucker Must Die"" isn't wholly original in most senses, since it takes cues from the infinitely superior ""Mean Girls."" But ""John Tucker Must Die"" does have plenty of intelligent laughs, many of which should come easily for any young woman who's had her heart broken and is looking for ways to plot revenge. The young cast is quite excellent (has any guy been more loathsome than JOHN TUCKER?), and they each relish their parts with equal delight. Screenwriter Jeff Lowell's script keeps the laughs fresh and the dialogue funny as the film progresses, and director Betty Thomas knows Lowell's Hell-hath-no-fury-like-a-woman-scorned writing inside-out.What the film ultimately suffers from is familiarity. We've seen stories like this plenty of times before in many other similar-themed teen movies. Perhaps if the story had taken the darker comic route, it would have gotten a better rating and would be more memorable in the long run (though it surely would have caught a fury of its own, and not of the good kind). And the film seems to lose itself to plot conventions in the third half, just when things seemed to be getting really interesting for this viewer. I guess that's expected from a genre that wears thin with each subsequent entry.Regardless of its plot limitations, I would suspect that ""John Tucker Must Die"" is a thoroughly entertaining way to ease the blues for those women who have had it with the deceitful males of the world and may look to this picture for some lessons in payback. At least this seemingly forever-single male knows never to upset a woman the way John Tucker does, or even show her ""John Tucker Must Die,"" because, you know, she might get ideas.8/10",John Tucker Must Die

21,MBunge,Good enough to be a momentary diversion,6,5 July 2011,"John Tucker Must Die is like the cute but somewhat dim witted cousin of Mean Girls. It's not as smart or interesting but it's still nice to look at. Instead of putting some thought into a story about the real way high school kids live, this film is content to be marginally amusing and about as deep and realistic as the average episode of Saved By The Bell.Kate (Brittany Snow) is the new girl in school. She's passing through her life like she's not even there until three of the popular girls, an overachiever (Arielle Kebbel), a cheerleader (Ashanti) and a hippie activist (Sophia Bush), all discover they're dating the same guy - high school demigod John Tucker (Jesse Metcalf). That sets the girls at each other's throats, until Kate sets them straight about how they're being used. She can do that because her mom has dated an unending stream of older versions of John Tucker. The united foursome set out to get revenge but fail repeatedly. Then they get the idea of making John Tucker fall in love with Kate and breaking his heart the way he broke theirs. The problem is that Kate starts to fall under John Tucker's spell, in addition to developing a flirtation with his brother (Penn Badgely). So the question becomesjust who is going to break whose heart?This movie has a very attractive cast, a charming tone, a quick pace and a script that isn't insultingly stupid. There aren't a lot of laugh out loud moments, but it's inoffensive and will provoke a few smiles. There's a basic level of competent storytelling at work here that, sadly, you don't see all the time. It's really not a bad film.However, it is very easy to sum up the problems with John Tucker Must Die. It's that John Tucker has a last name and neither Kate nor the other three girls do. There's no effort made to ground this story in anything real. It's a collection of clichés that are only slightly rearranged from all the other films and TV shows you've seen them in. It's not based on anyone's actual high school experience or an attempt to understand the dynamics that drive young people to do the things they do. Every situation, characterization and line of dialog here is tissue thin, with no surprises or anything to engage your brain or heart.But not every movie needs to be a masterpiece. Sometimes all you want or need is a frothy diversion and John Tucker Must Die fits that bill. It's pleasant, unchallenging and uninvolving. As long as you don't expect it to have more bite than a 90 year old grandma who's lost her dentures, you'll probably like itand then quickly forget it.",John Tucker Must Die
22,r96sk,Much to sit back with and enjoy,7,15 July 2020,"Actually pretty fun.I'm not sure what I was expecting coming into this, the early scenes suggested it was about be a long 87 minutes ahead. However, pleasantly, 'John Tucker Must Die' is entertaining. It's most definitely not one to take solemnly, but if you see it for what it is you might have a decent time.The cast work delightfully together, even if they do - along with all the other characters - act cliché more often than not. Brittany Snow is surprisingly impressive as Kate, her body language and facial expressions are actually perfect for the role. Ashanti (Heather), Sophia Bush (Beth) and Arielle Kebbel (Carrie) support solidly. Jesse Metcalfe (John) seems to play the same role every time, but there's no denying he connects with Kate well.Very silly and not a masterpiece by any definition, yet there is much to sit back with and enjoy. A mindless comedy.",John Tucker Must Die
23,davispittman,"A funny, sweet, sexy teen revenge comedy",8,24 June 2015,"I feel like this is just the perfect example of how to do a teenage film, you've got to know what to put in it, what appeals to that age demographic. First of all, I love how both guys and girls can watch this film, I think it definitely appeals to both sexes. For the ladies, we have Jesse Metcalfe, even in a pink thong in one scene ;). We also have lots of dialogue that will appeal to the women. For the men/boys, well lots of men love Brittany Snow, so there's that. Also, this film does teach a good message besides the whole revenge plot. Eventually, it explains that you don't need to cheat or fool with people's emotions. Yes, this movie has funny scenes, and good looking actors for both men and women to enjoy, but it does have a happy ending. I felt very entertained and satisfied by this teen flick. I feel like it's relatable, funny, attractive, and in the end has a good heart and message. I would for sure suggest teens and even adults watch this film. I also feel like the actors did a good job, no bad actors here. Also, the dialogue and source material was very well put together, so it wasn't hard for the actors to do well. 8/10 overall. Very happy movie. If you're sad or just looking to have some fun, Check it out!",John Tucker Must Die
24,triple8,really really lacking.,4,17 December 2006,"SPOILERS THROUGH:This Actually looked really funny in the initial previews but I didn't like it at all. This movie was kind of annoying. I didn't expect an Oscar Winner but I thought I'd at least get something moderately entertaining. But it really isn't. The movie's premise which sounded like it could be, at the very least, either moderately funny or somewhat engaging was not played out well at all. The movie took nothing seriously, so it was rather impossible to believe anything on screen. The characters were not very interesting either. Jennie Mcarthy was actually very good and she wasn't even in it much. I also REAllY liked the character of the younger brother of John Tucker but he wasn't in it much either.The way the premise played out was disappointing. There didn't seem to be any attempt to make it at all believable or original. Not only that but it wasn't that funny. Or very interesting. The movie was dull at times. There was no spunk to the movie. It seemed completely manufactured-a product.There was so little character development it was actually surprising. And Katie the main character is so pretty and bubbly it didn't make sense that she was portrayed as a plain Jane. Actually it was almost ridiculous. And I couldn't believe how bland the movie was. The premise, even if it's not all that original, could have been played out much much better then it was. The movie was so unbelievable, with so little character development and such ridiculousness to some of the situations that evolved that it was impossible to enjoy.As mentioned, I loved the younger rocker brother of John Tucker. But it wasn't until the end that one could even tell Katie liked him. Although it's not difficult to see from the beginning, that these two will end up together, the movie seemed to imply that Katie was actually falling for John Tucker. So it was kind of weird, with the whole triangle between the brothers.Basically I didn't like the movie much although it is watchable and far from dreadful. I would definitely not give it a 1 or 2 as others have done. But I wouldn't see it again. I'd say a 4 out of 10.",John Tucker Must Die
25,rivertam26,surprise a good movie...,8,30 July 2006,"I am so impressed. In a summer filled with soggy pirates, wasted superheroes and overegos emerges a clever , hysterical comedy thats viciously mean and good natured at the same time. John Tucker Must Die from laugh guru Betty Thomas of The Brady Bunch movie has fashioned a teen movie adults can enjoy. Some of the humor is crude but never offensive like in Clerks 2. Although it's title refers to film's main villain depending on what perspective you might take it's ultimately about a girl named Kate. Played by the slightly awkward but talented unknown Brittany Snow. She's remained invisible for most of her life while her hot mom has moved from one John Tucker to the next. Creating a series of useless and hurtful relationships. John Tucker played by Desperate Housewive's hottie is played perfectly by Jesse Metcalfe, he's a player with a heart, maybe. The movie is a little vague when it comes to that. He has three girlfriends the head cheerleader Heather played decently by Ashanti. a nympho vegan played brilliantly by One Tree Hill's sexy as hell Sophia Bush and a sexy brainiac played by Arielle Kibbel of this years little seen Aquamarine. But Although they all have realistic trailts there all purposely stereotypes, JT is the womanizer, Heather is the sassy airheaded cheerleader, Beth is a nympho vegan and Carrie is the sexy, brainy girl. The only real person here is Kate. She's the one the audience will ultimately find themselves identifying with. Although there are some funny antics, some hysterical antics actually featuring electrocution, hemp bras and a same sex make out session among others. Kate is struggling with her acceptance in society and her mother's inability to be in a good relationship. There is of course the obligatory cute, side guy this time it's JT's brother played by Penn Badgley. What makes John Tucker work is a clever script, it's decently original and is played mostly for laughs. In the end during a weird finale we seem to identify with the situation and all it's characters everyone seems to shed their fakeness and grow into people. It's chancey but it works, and it's happy. I must say i went into this film with very low expectations after a summer of duds but this film is a winner. It's clever, funny, well paced and unique. A different look at the teen movie and one thats well appreciated. ***(out of four) -Richard cavellero",John Tucker Must Die

The few laugh-out-loud moments and funny lines are not enough to make this good.Brittany Snow is the 'new girl', she gets played by the cheerleader, the smart chick, and the new-age hippie girl, just as they play John Tucker. It is just a mess about making people feel bad about themselves and then succumbing to peer-pressure. I thought movies like this were supposed to have positive messages?

30,Isaac5855,A cute but ultimately empty teen comedy...,6,6 June 2007,"Directed by Betty Thomas (THE BRADY BUNCH MOVIE), JOHN TUCKER MUST DIE is a breezy little piece of fluff about a high school stud (Jesse Metcalfe, ex-John, DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES) who is juggling three different girls, who all are part of different cliques, so they never really communicate, until fate brings the the three ladies together and they learn the truth. The girls initially want to snipe at each other, but a another girl (Brittany Snow)who has witnessed John in action, suggest the girls get revenge instead of getting mad and a plan is initiated to methodically destroy John Tucker's credibility as a human being, but the plan gets out of hand and heads in directions that no one anticipated. Thomas' energetic and imaginative direction is a big plus in making this pretty predictable comedy worth sitting through. There's no question that the camera loves Metcalfe and he works hard in the title role and Brittany Snow does display some solid leading lady potential as soon as she figures out she's not Hillary Duff. The film does provide laughs but the title character doesn't really learn the lesson he should and without that payoff, the film just leaves a bad aftertaste.",John Tucker Must Die
31,vampyrecowboy,John Tucker must be a hot guy,7,14 February 2009,"Yes, John Tucker - like every other basketball playing teen in any movie has to be the hot guy.He has to be the best looking, rich white boy who has everything given to him and has no cares and no parents either.Amazing how single, rich, good looking white boys never have family problems or parents for that matter.They have a nice car, have loads of time to do whatever they want and yet they don't have to report home or do dishes.Now as far as story, I find it OK and even funny in parts - but what gets me is in every teen comedy, the teens never have a hard life.The single parent always has a big house and a new car and is in fashion and has a date and is always busy and has a clean house.Kind of hard to believe tat a house can be so clean when mom is working her ass off to keep a $600 000 home in Vancouver and still make payments on the car, furnish the huge house with some pretty nice stuff, socialize and still look pretty.Living on the West side of Vancouver is very expensive - I know. I made my home there...and with a house like Kate's mom owns, well the payments would be close to $2000 a month on rent or mortgage alone - not including bills or food.With all that going on, in the days of the economy collapsing, how can teens and the single parent family still live so well? The little things like that annoy me when I see a film like this.The unrealism of things that would normally be very strenuous on a family and hard to achieve for a teen are just overlooked in so many movies.I can believe the other stuff such as the basketball team winning all the games or the sappy love story.I can't however believe that every teen has such an easy freestyle life in a teen comedy or that the single family home is always big, clean and equipped with the latest styles, freshest paint, cleanest windows and basically flawless.They're single parents. They're overworked, tired, depressed, upset, bored, lazy and aging.Which set dresser comes up with this ultra clean house myth? Have they looked at their own home?",John Tucker Must Die
32,LazySod,Just not good enough,4,13 January 2007,"A guy has a relation with a girl, but also one with another girl. That's unacceptable behavior, but it happens.

And there you have it. John Tucker is about to experience first hand the fury of three women scorned.And that's how it starts. A typical high-school comedy where the lead characters are all played out rather charactered and shallow, where peer pressure is still an important factor and where everything you do badly comes back at you in threefold.All in all, the recipe for a thirteen in a dozen film and this specific film doesn't climb above that in any way. More precisely, it fails to hold that standard as well. It just doesn't bring anything well enough to keep anyone really interested and fails to stand out. In fact, I think that John Tucker should have been a straight-to-video. Just not good enough.4 out of 10 women cheated",John Tucker Must Die
33,Flagrant-Baronessa,Falsely marketed  not that great,5,27 December 2006,"When the trailer for John Tucker Must Die premiered last summer, it was one of the best around, setting the smart, sexy tone for a teen comedy, as had the poster. Attempts had clearly been made to market this as a raunchy, hard-boiled and satirical revenge flick in high school setting  perhaps on-par with 'Heathers'  and it had successfully condensed the best and funniest parts of the film into 1:30 minute format. Even the Kill Billesque title suggests something with a little more punch and a little less sap than the run-of-the-mill teen comedy but regrettably 'John Tucker Must Die' fails to live up to its titular aim and shifts on meek auto-pilot within twenty minutes.The expository prelude introduces us to Kate (Brittany Snow), a self-proclaimed ""invisible"" girl whose slutty mother (Jenny McCarthy) makes them move from place to place at the end of every unsuccessful relationship. Cue a stereotypical high school in which captain of the basketball team John Tucker (Jesse Metcalfe) reigns supreme as a serial cheater who strategically dates one girl from each clique so they will never talk to each other: a slutty vegan hippie chick, a confident head cheerleader and a brainy blonde beauty  a little something from each fantasy. When one day they all find out about each other, Kate happens to be near and suggests they plan sweet revenge on John Tucker, and so ensues an elaborate high school mating-dance in which Kate is to be the perfect girl ... to break Tucker's cheating, lying heart.The premise is certainly gimicky and offers a wealth of possibilities, but as put forward, the film settles comfortably in the standard romantic teen comedy fare, slotting itself in with the rest of the forgettable 'comedies'. I don't want to spoil too much of the plotturns for virgin viewers, but rest assured that key characters will go through the dutiful developments. Kate grows from being the anonymous new girl to a queen of social might as Tucker reveals extensive interest in her, and perhaps it is no longer of the 'hit-and-run' type of appeal, but of honest emotional needs on his part. Will he finally learn the meaning of true love? The film is in this way a revenge-driven romp and an ugly duckling tale rolled into one and operating seamlessly throughout the story. There are strong warning signs to suggest that not only is Tucker beginning to open up, but of Kate falling for his deliberately charming antics and social status.Both operating story lines are sloppily tended to. The raunchy revenge side of the spectrum is neither very raunchy nor very clever. When the scheming ex-girlfriends and Kate smuggle Tucker estrogen under the false pretense of ""bulking up"", John Tucker resorts to girlish behaviour on the basketball court, asking ""do my thighs look fat?"" and pouring his heart out to the coach. Yeah, because estrogen will do that to a man. Inane. In the heat of warfare, the girls frequently underestimate the power that Tucker has over the school and botch and fumble through several plots, as when they dress him up in a pair of women's thongs he is first subject to mild ridicule but then comes to set a fashion statement (cliché of the decade). In this way, JTMD scrapes by on few comedic credentials that worse still are only sporadically effective  a half-assed humour approach that plays on throughout.The real treat is perhaps Brittany Snow as Kate. She is such an utterly cute and sweet-spoken girl-next-door that her presence and naive narration offers an innocent angle to the revenge-driven plot. At times she is a little too Hilary Duff/Olsen twins oriented, but there is something fresh about her looks and her character Kate. The rest of the cast are a joke, with Jenny McCarthy (!) being attributed the most dramatic weight in the most serious moments of the film as the irresponsible mom who comes around. Jesse Metcalfe fully reprises his Desperate Housewives act, albeit a bit more confidently so, but it is beyond me how someone so average can becomes King of a high school. Urk.It may well be that I have already ingested a teen comedy romp ('She's the Man') today that I am immensely tired of the whole pedestrian set-up. John Tucker Must Die is like a big bag of popcorn; it's fun and crisp the first couple of bites but quickly becomes too much and too soggy, sappy and tasteless, leaving you a little sick  and without any nutritional value.5 out of 10",John Tucker Must Die
34,christian123,Plenty of eye candy although not much in terms of entertainment and laughs.,5,26 December 2006,"John Tucker (Jesse Metcalfe) is a guy who can't be trusted by women and when three of his ex-girlfriends, all from different high school cliques, team up for revenge, they do so with the help of the new girl in town, setting her up with Tucker, with the plan to ruin his reputation and break his heart.John Tucker Must Die offers plenty of eye candy and a good premise yet the final product is pretty forgettable and standard. I'm actually a little surprised that the film didn't turn out to be better since the trailer was entertaining and the premise offered something a little different. I guess I was expecting something as good as Mean Girls and it was really just direct to DVD material. The script was weak and it used so many clichés. Jeff Lowell should stick with sitcoms since he can't come up with enough interesting material to cover a 90 minute running time.Director Betty Thomas was equally useless and she just used a generic direction. She didn't capture the teen spirit at all and she was just the wrong person for the job. The dialog was predictable and some of it was really corny. Some of the scenes just tried way too hard to be funny. However, the worst part about it was that the majority of the movie was just dull. Sure it looked nice but it only held a little entertainment value.The acting was, like the film, standard and forgettable. Jesse Metcalfe was average, neither bad nor great. He should stick to supporting roles since he doesn't have the screen presence to carry a film. Arielle Kebbel may not be a fantastic actress but she does have an engaging quality about her and she had a few good lines. Ashanti was so annoying and over the top. She gave the worst performance out of everyone. Jenny McCarthy was just disturbing to look at and her performance was awful. Brittany Snow was cute although she was also enormously bland. Her character was supposed to be bland at the beginning of the movie but even after she went through a change, she was still pretty un-notable. Sophia Bush was pretty good and she had many funny lines. The one good thing about the cast was that they appeared to be having fun and this helped out a little. Overall, John Tucker Must Die is familiar material and it's not really worth checking out. Rating 5/10",John Tucker Must Die

I'm a male in my 20s and the only reason I watched this movie was for date because the girl I was with said she used to love this movie.However with that all said, I've honestly seen worse. What this movie does well at is with its pacing, it doesn't feel draggy at all. It also isn't horrible teenage romance story and the premise is actually good.

38,Jay_Exiomo,Run-of-the-mill teen comedy,5,13 September 2006,"You'd think that a movie called ""John Tucker Must Die"" will approach the parameters of a gritty look on high school-style existentialism. As the National Geographic Channel puts it, think again.John Tucker (Jesse Metcalfe of ""Desperate Housewives"") is the star of their high school's basketball team, and he's secretly dating three girls simultaneously. Upon learning how their ""serial-cheating"" boyfriend is three-timing them, cheerleader Heather (Ashanti), intellectual Carrie (Arielle Kebbel) and activist Beth (Sophia Bush) plot for revenge. They set him to fall for new girl Kate Spencer (Brittany Snow) and have her break his heart later on.So that's ""John Tucker Must Die."" It's a film that tries to go for the feel-good parts of the standard teen flick, along with the usual high school relationship subplots. But gritty it's not. Though initially the movie seems to head towards being an effective satirical comedy, it immediately becomes just another stock sleaze. Betty Thomas' direction is breezy enough but she fails to give the film a distinctive bite as Jeff Lowell's screenplay seems not to draw a bead on to the vaguest notion of creativity.Metcalfe is effective as the eponymous lead while Snow (who I recall as Zoe in ""The Pacifier"") could have been charming but the problematic script doesn't give her a juicy character that could rise beyond its stereotype and she ends up bland. In fact, one could arguably root more for John Tucker. As for the rest of the cast, they're a mixed bag with Ashanti and Jenny McCarthy as Kate's mom figuring prominently in my head.""John Tucker Must Die"" isn't so much an absolute schlock. Despite its transparent and derivative nature, it does have some of its moments that elicit chuckles. It's that sort of movies I watch on sleepless nights on cable given the right mood.

But rather the title is there because after a long time and despite being a veteran of hundreds of movies I made a mistake.Now anyone who has seen the teaser of this movie or even the poster (and title) is will realise that despite the fact that the title of the movie has a guys name this movie is very much going to have Chick Flick elements to it.But I was bored and desperate and all of my girlfriends (no im not John Tucker just friends who are girls), were busy so I convinced my friends to come for this movie saying its along the lines of American Pie.Obviously a bunch of guys who expect an American Pie Chickfest are going to severely disappointed when the realise that this a PG-13 movie with obvious scenes that can be found in a chick flick.But I prepared for the same and I really liked the fact that for most of the movie the story is very much about the guy and which guy wouldn't want to be in John Tuckers shoes??!!! The chicks (save for Ashanti who looks hideous what were the filmmakers thinking casting her as the hot one, I have a theory but I rather not say), were super hot and super cute respectively and played their parts well.Brittany Snow did a good job of playing the girl next door and Jesse played the role of the John Tucker effortlessly.For most of the first half thankfully you almost think it is a guy flick with loads of hot chicks and male humour.The movie may lack any really big funny scenes but it is loaded with a large amount of funny jokes some of funnier ones were the 2 or 3 failed attempts by the girls to ruin John such as the hilarious STD joke and the Womens underwear joke.Mostly this movie is filled with chuckles and displayed some great potential of being a true satire on the over hyped high school years.Unfortunately but after bunch of funny scenes and loads of chuckling and smiling (and did I mention ogling at Jenny Mcarthy as the super hot mom) soon enough this movie deviates towards mediocrity and becomes a run-of-the-mill teen comedy and adds some chick flick elements to boot.Then again a climax that could have been a gratifying scene for dozens of emotional girls and sheer torture for guys was very well handled and had both the sides satisfied,especially me because I expected a 5 min monologue from a bunch of girls.Stuff such as the soundtrack , direction etc were good but good is the least that we see nowadays, still you cannot help thinking that this movie had potential to be much more and that was clearly wasted.Which brings me to my favourite topic the ratings, so its OK to see a guys ass in thongs or even bare its OK to use words like Sl@t, bitch and talk freely about casual sex, boobs bras and PREMARITAL UNDERAGED SEX in front of children below thirteen (and then ponder about how to tackle teenage pregnancy) but its not OK to say words like f$%k.Once again the worst curse to films the PG-13 rating rears its ugly head.The best part of the movie (and probably what saved me) though that its short and sweet (89 mins) and before you know it the movies over and your out of the theater feeling pretty satisfied.In all a run-of-mill teen comedy with a something for both the guys and the girls, but just a little more for the girls.SO GUYS NO MATTER HOW DESPERATE YOU ARE PLEASE Don't WATCH THIS MOVIE (OR ANY OTHER MOVIE OF THIS SORT) WITH A COMPANY CONSISTING OF ONLY GUYS.This movie can definitely be put in the list of movies to watch when your up for a teen comedy and nothing else clicks.-s chick flick elements, wasted potential, Ashanti (distractingly ugly with her MAN-ABS ), no really big scenes.+/-s was prepared for what i was getting into, incorrect company.+s great cast (except off-course...), decent technically, lots of chuckling and a bunch of funny scenes, super way of handling the climax.total 6.5/10 (factoring in lowered expectations and the bad company but don't know how much better it would have been with girls around).",John Tucker Must Die

Why would she be in ANY movie? If you think she's a rubbish singer (which is FACT), just wait 'till you see her act. Her ""acting"" is embarrassing. And people say that Madonna is a bad actress... Madonna deserves an Oscar for her acting -- compared to THIS! Jenny McCarthy is PAINFUL to watch; she can't act to save her life.John Tucker is also pathetic -- not believable for one second. And his associates are a bunch of lamers (who, as well as the rest of the cast, are useless at acting).Brittany Snow, the lead actress, should not be considered an actress at all. Any random girl, with no affiliation with the movie industry, could've done a better job -- I'm 100% sure.THE PLOT: Do they expect anyone to believe that Kate is an outcast and has never had any friends/dates? She is better-looking than the so-called popular girls. It would've been interesting to watch Carrie White's transformation, but Kate was never ugly/unpopular to begin with.Even if Kate was the sexiest woman in the world (which she is far from), no one is worth that amount of chasing. I find it difficult to believe that John Tucker was THAT interested in her. There's hardly any chemistry.John Tucker is supposedly the most popular guy, but he has no charisma and comes across as a jerk/sleaze-bag, yet EVERY girl in school is after him? And that ridiculous scene where he gets an award for herpes or something... oh, dear! Kate's Mum insists on moving to a new city every times she breaks up with a boyfriend!? ... I was going to write some more, but ...Yeah, now I'm kind of fed up. This movie is not worth reviewing. Why did I even begin? I can't be bothered to finish it now. It's a waste of time, basically. There are FAR better movies in the dumb teen genre to watch.",John Tucker Must Die

Shame about his limited acting ability though, as the infamous John Tucker was simply a more confident version of his ""Desperate Housewives"" character John Rowland, but nevertheless, Metcalfe seems to enjoy his characters, and certainly makes them come to life. In the case of ""John Tucker must Die"", Metcalfe's John Tucker is the most popular guy in school and a total player, cheating on three girls from different social circles, who were never meant to find out - until they unexpectedly had gym class together.The three girls being Ashanti's bitchy cheerleader Heather, Arielle Kebbel's smart hard working Carrie, and Sophia Bush's semi-reject, semi-slutty Beth. The girls all dislike each other very much and argue about who Tucker likes the most, but new girl Kate (played by the lovely Brittany Snow) points out to the girls that instead of fighting each other, they should be uniting to get revenge on the guy that has lied to them all - and thus begins the four girls attempting to bring down John Tucker.""John Tucker Must Die"" is strictly formulaic in terms of teen-comedies in that situations do not go as planned for the girls, causing Tucker to become even more popular (if that is at all humanly possible). Throw into the mix Kate's inexperience when it comes to guys, being caught between John Tucker and the affections of his brother 'the Other Tucker' Scott (Penn Badgley), and her mother (played very well by Jenny McCarthy) who has a lot of man problems herself.""John Tucker Must Die"" is a highly-likable film in terms of some funny moments, a fairly decent cast, a cool soundtrack and things move at a steady pace, but the main problem is that just when some morals are going to be dished out at the end of the film, something happens and the morals are not told. Which is a big shame, because for the target-audience of this film, they could really use some good morals being dished out to them. Nevertheless, ""John Tucker Must Die"" is an all-round enjoyable film. Oh - and Ashanti can act, but be warned - her fabulous hair often takes up most of the screen and at times over powers her performance. But she has great hair so that's okay.",John Tucker Must Die
44,neenahhh,Teen film that teaches good values! Just squint.,7,13 March 2011,"This movie was really entertaining. I've heard of recommendations of this movie here and there, but never really got around to watching it. I thought this was a horror movie actually! But I'm glad I decided to watch it.'John Tucker Must Die' is about Kate, an unpopular girl, who is sucked into a scheme by 3 girls who were dumped by John Tucker. Kate's mission: Get John Tucker to fall for her and then crush his heart. Only, things don't quite go as planned.Just from seeing that short opener- don't you already kind of know what this movie is going to be about? But there's a bit (a tiny bit) more going on. I felt like the characters weren't really developed that much on. Especially Kate, which is pretty disappointing. I just felt like she turned from a nobody to a somebody in a blink of an eye. I didn't really get why and how the transformation was so fast.I got a 'Mean Girls' and 'Easy A' sort of vibe from this movie. Sure, people might complain and say that this movie's plot was absolutely cliché, but it was fun! It's a lot better than a whole load of other movies that are trying to pass off as teen films.A hilarious film for teenagers. Actually, it's perfect for anyone's who's in the mood for some laughs. Plus Penn Badgley was total eye candy. Made me wish he was the main character.",John Tucker Must Die
45,guyfromjerzee,"A funny, enjoyable comedy that went beyond my expectations",8,26 December 2006,"Admittedly, during the first 20-or-so minutes of the movie, I wasn't too impressed, and was expecting to be tortured with the same lame teen flick. But as the film went on, I was surprisingly engaged. First off, I found all the characters at least mildly interesting, especially the one played by Brittany Snow. And though some of the gags were undeniably low-brow, I found myself laughing through most of the flick. I found it amusing that no matter how much these girls try to obliterate John Tucker's reputation, he just seems to get more popular, resulting in such bizarre incidents as the fellow players on his basketball team wearing thongs. The actors are all charismatic and charming. I felt Jessie Metcalfe gave the role of John Tucker more depth than most young actors would, and actually made him somewhat likable, rather than a total jerk who just happens to be good-looking. The ending wasn't what I expected. I felt it delivered a good message about men (or women) pretending to be people they're not, in order to find mates. ""John Tucker Must Die"" delivered beyond my expectations, since it turned out to be both funny and touching. It still has some elements of the standard teen comedy (with the actors and actresses all looking they just stepped off a photo shoot for ""Teen People""), but those elements didn't destroy the film.",John Tucker Must Die

I wanted to see Clerks II or Lady In THe Water. Seeing the commercial I figured I'd hate this film since I am not a fan of chick flicks. So, aside from that, this is the type of movie you have seen a thousand and one times. It has a plot similar to the film Chasing Papi, and while I did not like that film, that film was better than John Tucker. Alright, so this cool guy is dating three girls at the same time, they find out, blah blah blah, a ""good"" lesson we have seen 50 times is learned, and some girl who is invisible becomes someone who is ""cool."" Yes, another teen romantic comedy with a predictable plot and predictable ending. YOung girls may enjoy it, but most people will think it is blah. THe only highlight is one fat guy who farts and says ""Look mom, no hands!"" Yes. That was the funniest part, and that is SAD. That acting is fine, I admit, some good performances by the girls and John Tucker's acting was fine. The main problem was unoriginality. Every film like this has the same lesson, sometimes a better way to teach a lesson is to show what happens if you don't learn, and that may teach a lesson better, if that makes sense. Basically a man bashing, girl loving film with YES, a ""lezbo"" scene. Avoid at all costs unless you are a 14 year old girl with a bunch of 14 year old girly friends.

It may surprise you that this is the movie that I would choose, but I have four good reasons for doing so: Brittany Snow, Sophia Bush, Arielle Kebbel, and Ashanti. Anytime four gorgeous girls are all acting together (and playing tough man-eaters, at that), you can count me in. So, did I have a happy birthday or did I walk away feeling as though I wasted my ""special day""? Let's be honest, it was my birthday so my critic-sense was turned off and I was just looking for a good time. ""John Tucker Must Die"" served its purpose. It was a fun, flirty, and enjoyable movie that kept my family and I laughing. It isn't an intelligent movie and it isn't groundbreaking, but it works. Though, unfortunately, not as saucy as ""Mean Girls"", ""John Tucker Must Die"" embraces a slightly whimsical heart that doesn't want to offend anyone, yet it isn't what I would call a ""safe"" movie. If you are going to see this movie as a movie critic, then you might as well just skip this one altogether. You are wasting your time. If you want to see a movie that is simply fun and enjoyable, then ""John Tucker Must Die"" more than serves its purpose.John Tucker (Metcalfe) is the hottest guy at school. He is the star basketball player with amazing good looks and six-pack abs. And he has a beautiful girlfriendokay two girlfriendswait, three girlfriends! They are Heather (Ashanti), the cheerleading captain, Beth (Bush), the sexy animal rights activist, and Carrie (Kebbel), the attractive intellectual. All are from different cliques and all have fallen for the same lie--that he can't date them because he can't have a serious girlfriend during basketball season. When the new girl at school, Kate (Snow), happens to fall into all of their lives just as they discover that John is a liar and a cheater, she agrees to help them get revenge. But, all of there attempts to ruin him only make him seem better. ""I'd hit him with my car if he wouldn't make body casts a fashion statement,"" Beth states angrily. So, they all hatch a plan to make John fall in love with Kate so that she can crush him. But, can Kate manage to keep from falling for John's charms and finish the plan successfullyor will she fall in love with high school's biggest lady's man just like everyone else? Let's talk about the casting and the performances. Jesse Metcalfe was practically perfect casting. There is not a straight woman in this world who doesn't think he is attractive. My mother even proclaims that he is ""flawless"". Now, he's a good actor as proved in ""Desperate Housewives"" (for me anyway) and, coming from a male's perspective, very good looking. People are able to forgive the fact that his character is a lying hound dog because women are too distracted by his looks and guys are just amazed at how well he managed to balance three women at one time. Brittany Snow (who had a lengthy, yet disappointing role in ""Nip/Tuck""--the makers really gave her a horrible deal in what character she played) is cute as a button and draws the audience in. She does a very nice job. Sophia Bush is probably my favorite young actress (despite still not having done a very profound breakout role--I can't wait for her to finally blossom fully) and does a great job here. It's always a pleasure and I am so hoping that she will find her place in Hollywood history VERY soon. She deserves it. Ashanti also gives a very credible performance and had me laughing almost constantly. She just clicked. Jenny McCarthy doesn't have much of a part, but she handles her very small time quite well.Let's be honest, ""John Tucker Must Die"" was not made for critics and it was not made for the Academy Awardsbut, frankly, I am getting so very sick of critics thinking that every movie should be the next ""Gone with the Wind"". It's perfectly acceptable to watch a movie just for the pure enjoyment of it all and this movie is good in that respect. On the downside, however, what happened with the ending? It just kind of ended and made no sense. It was a disappointing conclusion. Another thing was that it was a little too cute and nice for its own good. This movie should have had more bite than ""Mean Girls"", but it took the safer, tamer route. I didn't necessarily mind, but I did notice that it could have been much better. This movie had sugar and everything nicebut not much spice, at all. But still, nice performances and a more than adequate story, as well as almost nonstop laughs, made this movie a very entertaining flick. Teen girls will get the most enjoyment out of it, but it works well for people outside of its target audience as well. Just don't take it so seriously.Final Thought: Light and funny, ""John Tucker Must Die"" is entertaining, but not for overly-serious people.Overall Rating: 7/10 (B+)",John Tucker Must Die
51,mcsheehey,This Movie Must Die,3,6 June 2007,"""John Tucker Must Die"" lacks originality. It's as simple as that. The story goes something like this. Kate Spencer (Brittany Snow) is kind of a nerdy outsider at her school, until she suddenly steps up at the right time and becomes instant friends with three shallow popular girls. This is exactly the same as the start of ""Mean Girls,"" and is very similar to the start of ""Never Been Kissed."" The difference is, while those two comedies branched out and explored new plot lines, flowing with originality, ""John Tucker"" continues stealing plot lines from other romantic teen comedies, never giving us anything original.The basic premise of the film is that Kate and her new ""friends"" want to get revenge on John Tucker, the cool guy in school, for two or three-timing each of them. The plan is to get Kate involved with him. Of course, like any teens in teen movies, her friends just happen to have advanced surveillance equipment, and they try to help her on her first date with john using a hidden camera (a straight steal from ""Never been Kissed""). Kate eventually becomes the very kind of person she used to hate (a popular and lustful witch). Again, we've seen it before in ""Mean Girls""! Aside from this clichéd main plot, we get a useless sub-plot involving Kate's mother. Her mom tries to give her dating advice, but she herself dates nothing but losers (""The Perfect Man"" was all about this same plot).Where the film really becomes a simple copy-cat is the pranks the girls play on John to get even with him. They're all things we've seen a million times, and they aren't all that funny.""John Tucker Must Die"" is not a terrible film. Brittany Snow and her posse give pretty good performances, and Jesse does an O.K. job as John Tucker. The problem is, the film makes no real statements about anything, and it's really just a pasting of different parts of other romantic comedies. In the end, it's the kind of film that people will eventually just forget about. Until then, you'll get no recommendation from me.3/10",John Tucker Must Die

If they had concentrated on the Kate-having-a-crush-on-John-Tucker's-older-brother storyline and have them hook up in the end, the movie would've been way more interesting. Instead, we had revenge by thongs, estrogen pills, ""invisible"" Kate playing hard to get. So where's the ""killing"" part?

Back when I was a teen, teenage movie contained all stereotypes (the ditsy popular girls, the smart nerdy girls) but this movie was really intelligent. Not that it was realistic, but it was more than just entertaining. The girls, who were considered popular and beautiful were not stupid or ditsy and had a wide interests other than being popular. One was very interested in school and studying, and concentrated hard on getting into a great college. Another girl was an animal rights activist (though they did stereotype her as ""being easy"" because she was a ""vegan teen activist""). One was a cheerleader which is another popular girl stereotype, but at least she was not the stereotypical ditsy cheerful cheerleader. Other than that, the movie was very intelligent. The actresses of course, like many movies, are woman in their mid twenties playing teenagers, and they did look very mature, for high school students; however, they passed for high school students.

The girls are all terrific and Jesse Metcafe struts his acting and physique to an even higher standard than what he demonstrated on Desperate Housewives.Filled with quite a few clever innuendos, it might make a few moms and dads cringe, but I guess kids today have heard worse. Also, it cleverly used remakes of classic songs for the bulk of its score.",John Tucker Must Die

To be totally honest, I did not have very high expectations; just thought it looked like fun and what a surprise this turned out to be! This is by far one of the best rom-coms I have seen in a long time. Like most rom-com comedies, they are funny but only for a short period of time. This movie held my attention through to the end and had plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, twists and fun surprises. I loved the netball scene! It is bound to have you laughing out loud within seconds! The story is pretty simple but is wonderfully crafted together. Three girls (who have had their hearts broken by womanizer John Tucker) band together with ""new girl"" - Kate - to get even with him by breaking his heart. I've got to say, the actors/actresses work brilliantly together. You can really feel the chemistry between them. Yes, it is a bit predictable but it is still very funny and well worth watching, especially if you are into these types of movies. It left me feeling happy and good inside. I haven't really got a bad thing to say about. 9/10.",John Tucker Must Die

She moves to a new town and meets a teenage jock and womanizer John Tucker (Jesse Metcalfe). He dates three girls Carrie (Arielle Kebbel) a reporter for school paper and overachiever, Heather (Ashanti) the head-cheerleader and Beth (Sophia Bush) a vegan protester.The three girls find out with Kate's help that John's cheating on them. They attempt to get even by playing tricks on John but he quickly breaks up with them. They then decide to use Kate to get even by making her a new cheerleader.

Kate (Snow) is the new girl in school, but often feels invisible. Kate has moved to many schools because of her mum always makes her move town, when her latest boyfriend sneaks out of the house once, he has got what he wanted. Kate is waitress, and along the next 3 days at work, she serves john tucker (Metcalfe) the most popular boy in school, go on 3 dates with 3 different girls.

On the second date he is with heather (Ashanti) she is the schools head cheer leader, and on the 3rd date he is with Beth (Bush) she is a vegan and is all about animal rights. One day after this all 4 girls are sent to detention, where ate revels to the other 3 that he was cheating on all of them, they then hatch a plan to get this Serial-Cheater back ,for the pain he has caused them. This movie is great for teens, but for not younger children and most adults, also it is more for girls but some boys may like it. This movie shows that even if girls hate each other they can all pull together for a common cause. Men. It Connotes how teenagers mind's work these days and what a lot of boys or out to get from girls rather than be a couple. Also it shows how arrogant men can be, by showing that the boys in this movie see nothing wrong with two timing or three timing. Additionally it also demonstrates how girls sometimes use each other to get what they want, whether they are friends or not. This movie is perfectly executed and has a very good script to it and the ideas of what the girls come up with to do to John.

It is much more subtle.While the movie condemns John Tucker's behavior - it also condemns the girls' behavior. Is John Tucker to blame for how easily the girls are impressed by his cheesy lines? Perhaps it is the girls' own shallowness that sets them up to be used by the likes of John Tucker - or perhaps the girls themselves are using John Tucker to advance their own agenda? As the head cheerleader says, ""He's mine - I'm the head cheerleader, we're supposed to be together."" She doesn't like him because he's particularly nice - which he isn't - but just because he's cool, has a bad boy image and feeds her cheesy lines that any self-respecting girl would find repulsive.All in all, you John Tucker Must Die haters should watch the movie again, with a different perspective. It is not just a criticism of John's behavior, it is a criticism of the kinds of behaviors and attitudes that let a guy like John Tucker be thought of as ""all that"" based on his status as star basketball player and bad boy.",John Tucker Must Die

And this thing about popular chicks in high school has to go! The movie was predictable from the second it started, to the moment the credits rolled! The whole idea (I know) isn't to make 'Citizen Kane', but to make a funny movie that fun to watch. AND IT WASN'T EVEN THAT! The jokes were really old, and the characters were more boring than the story! In conclusion, if you see this movie, you obviously don't know what a good movie is. Save your money! 1 out of 10!

So the comedy isn't particularly clever but it wasn't stupid or gross out either.
I found this very engaging, it kept my attention and I did enjoy it. Also, the predictable ending didn't happen. I was so happy that the writers didn't go the obvious, easy, predictable. It is still a typical teenage rom-com ending, but not the kind that make a you roll your eyes and wonder why you bothered watching it to the end.

81,northofcb,Irresponsible with NO Intelligence,3,6 September 2007,"I will start out by saying that I loved Mean Girls. It was spicy, smart, but not overcooked. It worked a miracle by carefully walking the line between tweeny fun and adult raunch. That film gets a 7+ from me.Fast forward to John Tucker. What can I say. It is a brainless wreck, that's what I can say. It is completely devoid of anything resembling smart. The four girls that fight for Tucker are completely drones and do not show any signs of being ""characters"" in any sense of the word. The only one I even halfway enjoyed was Bush as Beth. I give her an once of credit, but most of that results from being placed in funny situations. The other 3 are just terrible. Ashanti was just grating, wooden, and the total opposite of the sassy cheerleader she is trying to portray. Instead, she comes off as a total stereotype - the head cheerleader who wants the head player - yuck. Why do movie-makers have the idea that cheerleaders are brainless? Our 4.0 student was a cheerleader 2 years in a row!!! Anyway, terrible.Britney Snow should hang her head in shame. Her voice comes off so annoying! I cannot think straight. Anyway, the movie does not even have an ending. One minute you are in the middle of drama and next the movie is over! Horrible editing.Despite all of this, the worst thing about this movie is how irresponsible it is. Everybody wants to screw john tucker and nobody seems to have a problem with that! In fact, all the main character, except Snow, admit to sex with him. Maybe movies do not have a responsibility to teach good morals, but they knew this movie has aimed at 12-15 year olds with jesse's big guns etc. blah.

82,cal112hmb,Decent movie...just don't expect too much,5,29 July 2006,"First off, don't go into the theater thinking this is going to be the greatest teen film of all time. It isn't, nor does it try to be. This movie was perfect for what my girlfriend and I were looking for: something light, mildly funny, with a few early 20's actors playing the stereotypical roles. Some might be let down by Sophia Bush's role in this movie, although she did have some good moments. Ashanti wasn't half bad in her head-cheerleader role, Arielle Kebbel was okay (didn't have enough good lines though), and Jesse Metcalfe was truly born to play John Tucker. Anyone who has seen him on Desperate Housewives will agree that he definitely looks the part of John.The only actor who seemed out of place was John Tucker's brother, played by Penn Badgley, although it wasn't for lack of talent. The character was very out of place throughout the entire movie and didn't really add anything to the plot. When he did get a scene he definitely shined, but they were too few for him to make a difference to the plot.I think the movie could have been better, but again, it didn't try to do too much in the first place.

(for the record, these ideas look awful in writing) As the movie is being summed up, and we learn that John Tucker never lied again, they should have also explained that he was also coming out of the closet.

A typical high school movie, where the girls want to get back at the guy for cheating. A soap opera for teens. Every time they tried to bring John Tucker down, he fixes it. And again and again, until the end when all is revealed and fixed with two minutes worth of dialog and a food fight. Whoopee.

Sophia Bush, Arielle Keebble, and Brittany Snow are excellent. The only complaint with the leading ladies is Ashanti. She's not bad, but she's not good either. Jesse Metcalfe is HOT!!

87,kristy_chan,Teen Schlock,3,4 September 2006,"I just paid $2.50 to see this movie, only because I was passing time. Sadly, it looked better than the other options at the dollar theater. ""John Tucker Must Die"" follows formulaic teen romantic/comedy stock plots about makeovers to become popular and manipulation of relationships. I've seen it before in the likes of ""Mean Girls"", ""Clueless"", ""She's All That"", and I've seen it done much better in other films. ""JTMD"" features actors who are much too old for high school, which was vaguely reminiscent of ""Beverly Hills 90210"" for me. The acting is mostly poor or mediocre. It lacks emotional nuances. Even with the most flaky characters, better teen comedies succeed in making you at least cheer the movie's characters on in their misadventures. Think of the endearingly awkward heroines of John Huges fare. Instead, we are left with inconsistent and vapid characters in ""John Tucker Must Die"". The main character, for example, is mostly a straight laced and thoughtful student, but she yells at her mother played by too-young Jenny McCarthy for ""messing her up"". It doesn't follow during the course of the film that she is experiencing angst at all, unless you consider her chosen low social profile to be a desperate and pathological act. Damaged characters need to be more than just shy and poetic. They need to have visible anger and frustration, which the protagonist never displays. We aren't privy to her angst, and it leaves the viewer feeling ambivalent about her. Also, the cheap turn from high school social manipulation to moral confession to food fight toward the end of the movie comes across as pointless, ridiculous, and absurd. The romantic development of the two main characters comes across as forced and improbable. I wondered how John Tucker could actually fall in love with a heroine with the personality of stale toast, especially when she is surrounded by more colorful characters who only make her appear more two-dimensional and boring. We see John Tucker, high school womanizer on dates with sassy, ambitious, and open-hearted young women, but then are supposed to believe he really falls in love with the girl who is attempting to pull the wool over his eyes by alternating between silence, diverted eye contact, and constipated facial expressions? As well, many other emotional displays in the film aren't contextual with the narrative or congruent with other scenes, leaving one with a sense of in-credulousness about the characters' integrity. All in all, this movie is clumsy and a waste of time.The other quality that is sadly lacking is any relevant pop cultural references. Cool teenagers today aren't bragging about liking Elvis Costello or Cheap Trick, which is what we see in this film, and the entire soundtrack of Blink-182 sound-a-likes leaves much to be desired. One of the fun things about teenage cinema is seeing what is trendy with teenagers right now, and ""JTMD"" doesn't even deliver that bare minimum standard.The only comedic moments for me were when I was laughing at this film for it's occasional stumbles into schlock territory. Unfortunately, most of ""JTMD"" is just mediocre and forgettable.My other criticism of this movie is related to the fact that I am a feminist. I watch movies, using my feminist analytical lens. I had a few politically-charged criticisms of this film: First, when John Tucker is humiliated at the movies with the suggestive ad saying he has genital herpes, I thought that really contributed to general ignorance about sexually transmitted diseases and infections. Herpes is not a fatal disease. While it can complicate child-bearing and can be cosmetically unpleasant, it is not that big of a deal. The other thing that is worth being fearful about genital herpes is that it increases chances of catching HIV. However, John Tucker's date is seen getting up in disgust and running away from him. After all of the grassroots activism for AIDS and demystifying sexuality and STD's, it is unethical to present genital herpes as something you should RUN AWAY, SCREAMING from. That is misinformed and stigmatizing for people who live with herpes. One in five adults in the U.S. has genital herpes. Second, I thought it was misogynist and trans-phobic when John Tucker unwittingly takes estrogen and is reduced to an insecure, crying, chocolate-eating wimp. Is that what it means to be female? What the hell? And this scene presents a problematic view of what it means to be a male-bodied individual taking estrogen. Hollywood isn't shy about ridiculing women and trans-gendered people, and I felt that this scene was no exception.",John Tucker Must Die

""John Tucker Must Die"" is the perfect movie for that occasion.

The film revolves around Kate Spencer (Brittany Snow), a congenial but awkward new girl at a school divided by cliques. One day, in gym class, she overhears three girls arguing over who is dating John Tucker (Jesse Metcalfe), the school hunk. The three girls are Heather (Ashanti), a wisecracking cheerleader, Beth (Sophia Bush), the school tramp, and Carrie (Arielle Kebbel), the student government president. The problem is that John Tucker is a player, and all three are dating him at the same time. Kate intervenes and agrees to help the three girls plot revenge against him. However, Kate ends up falling for John Tucker, and problems arise. ""John Tucker Must Die"" was better than I expected it to be. The film has many funny parts and memorable lines.

John Tucker does not die, though I can't say how thrilled I would have been if this event were to have come to pass. No, as fate would have it, nobody dies in this movie. In fact, the only people who end up close to death by the end of the movie are the audience, who, in all likelihood, will be scrambling about in the theater, desperately searching for something pointy to impale themselves with.Yeah, its that bad.Don't get me wrong. I didn't walk into this movie expecting to see something that was Oscar-worthy. Hell, to say that I even walked in willingly would be a lie beyond comprehension. However, after the suggestion from my sister, who compared this movie to ""Mean Girls,"" I thought I'd go check it out.""Mean Girls"" this move is definitely not.If anything it plays out like a sub-par episode of Salute Your Shorts, where everyone on the screen knows the stereotype of their character and exploits it to no end. There's the nerdy girl, who's way too hot to be nerdy, but apparently not too hot to develop complex computer programs to plan John Tucker's demise, or get her hands on oober expensive spy equipment to sneak a peak at Mr. Tucker's dating life. Of course, let's not forget the cheerleader who is assertive and sexually active, but not too slutty because that would tarnish her image. That role is filled by the vegan slut of the movie, who is dumb in every imaginable form, and gets by by her unfathomable ability to work a man over. Last but not least we have the poor, wholesome (yet unfathomably hot) girl, who like Lindsay Lohan in ""Mean Girls,"" is just caught in the middle of someone else's evil scheme that transforms her from a nobody to the most popular girl in the school.It all feels as if its been done before. That's because it has.Clearly, this was a film pieced together for the dumbest of the 13-year-old girl spectrum. So dumb, in fact, that a line like ""Slut in truck"" will undoubtedly fill your theater with a roar of intolerable girl-cackles, simply because it kind of rhymes. Of course, if you're a normal human being, you won't go see this movie.

Remarkably I watched the whole thing, although I can only really tell you what happened in roughly the first half hour.I had this sneaking suspicion that this film wasn't written by a professional, but came about through a competition held by the studio, and 15 year old Tiffany from South Carolina won. This was the script she wrote.A bunch of highschool girls get together and plot how they can get back at John Tucker who was three timing the lot of them. One of the ways they get their revenge really had me scratching my head. Somehow they get John to pose for a photo shoot (as well as a top basketball player at his school, he also does some professional modelling on the side?). I'm not sure how the girls financed this photo shoot, but I'll let that one slide... and I really am letting a lot slide there. Like, how did they employ a professional photographer to take these photos? How did they source the photoshoot location? With whom did they arrange the casting of John Tucker for this photoshoot? Was he with an agency and they asked for him specifically? Did he need any parental consent to work on this shoot given that he is a minor?What happens is they take these photos and use them to create an advertisement for something embarrassing (erectile disfunction, or sexually transmitted disease... whatever. I can't remember). They maybe edited these photos themselves, I guess. This ad is then broadcast at their local cinema amongst the other ads before the main feature. How the heck these girls were able to pull this off, I have no idea. Was it a campaign that featured over the entire cinema network, this one chain, or just this one specific cinema? Either way, how would a bunch of highschool girls negotiate with the cinema advertising distribution company to have a fake product broadcast? How would they know which specific showing John Tucker was going to take his new girlfriend to? How convenient it was for them to get seats up on the balcony so they could get John and his girlfriend's reaction who were, conveniently, sitting in the middle of the cinema. How convenient that the house lights were still sufficiently bright despite images being projected on the cinema screen that they could see their reactions.This section of the film had me so befuddled that I didn't really take in whatever happened in the rest of the film. My brain was already hurting too much.",John Tucker Must Die

However, after I saw the film I was surprised to find the film uplifting, with some depth , and good actors. Ashanti,Bush,and Kebbel blend together well as they team up against Tucker. Each of their personalities contribute to this film in a special way. Snow (the lead character) was what made the film. She truly lit up the screen.Actors aside the movie as a whole was enjoyable and exciting. This movie maybe was not the most spectacular movie created. But it was fun and worth spending a few bucks to see.If you are looking for something entertaining, you might want to give this a try.4 out of 5 stars",John Tucker Must Die

I thought that my mother and I liked it more than my niece did, I'm not sure if that was because we could relate to the moral of the story but I know she laughed a lot louder than we did at times.

Jesse Metcalfe was absolutely gorgeous in this flick but that won't stop you from hating his guts after the first 20 minutes. He plays the typical self centered good looking jerk you will find in any high school. As you saw in the previews the movie is based on 3 girls getting revenge on him for cheating on all of them, with the help of their new friend. I can say I laughed out loud at least 10 times watching them try to ruin his life & I can definitely say I wanted to see him go down. The love scenes were believable & sweet & the funny scenes were funny but I guess what this movie lacked was a great ending. It was very predictable what was going to happen in the end & that kind of takes away from you wanting to sit there & finish watching it. This is a very cute movie & if you are into the teen movies I'd say it's worth watching but if your looking for something outstanding I'd save your money to see something else.",John Tucker Must Die

There are many scenes that will have you laughing very hard!!! For those who see it and are older, think back to your high school days and you will see that it hasn't changed much. It is definitely worth seeing again and even buying the DVD. The girls in the movie are perfect! I do feel that they could have possibly had a better actor for John Tucker (Jessee Metcalfe). He was good to a point, but i feel for that character, they could have found someone that was more arrogant.Overall it was a great and funny movie. I would not take my kids under 13 because of the sexual innuendos and humor. Also parents may not want their kids to see John Tucker(Jesse Metcalfe) in a lacy thong.",John Tucker Must Die

Do not waste your time watching this movie if you think you're going to find humor in this. Though this film is considered a Chick-Flick I'm sure even women find this movie ridiculous on any level. You're better off watching movies like You, Me & Dupree; Accepted; Something New and so on. You get the message but if you're into watching tasteless filth or if you just want to see some hot girls than this film is for you. This movie even makes The Fifth Element a good movie to watch & everybody knows The Fifth Element sucked. I personally can't see why anybody would want to waste their time & money seeing this God-Awful movie. What also adds to the useless crap in the movie is there is a Food Fight scene in the last part in the film which is ridiculous & is not needed for a movie that already sucks from the get-go. If I'm going to waste my time watching people make asses out of themselves I'd watch a President Bush Speech on television.

And I mustn't forget, the beloved Brittney Snow, she did great as usual with her girl next door, goody two-shoe image. I would hate to cross her in a dark alley. It was funny, drew you in and you could watch it again. What's his name, the lead guy, he was good, when you expected him to crumble, he took the bull by the horns and turned it around. Good movie.

It's actually an entertaining little high school romp with some fresh faces and some ideas that aren't the usual tired teenage fare.The film's plot is simple -- three of the schools most popular girls discover they're each dating John Tucker. In response, they seek revenge by ruining his life, wrecking his reputation, and breaking his heart.The good news is that their tricks are not terribly predictable. They really make him sweat and it provides some giggles and a few hearty laughs. I found this film to be a lighthearted distraction and enjoyable time.

105,jdmarks7,Utterly disappointing,2,30 May 2014,"When I first heard of this movie, my impression was this was going to be a really good, really funny revenge comedy for teenagers. Admittedly, John Tucker Must Die does have its moments. But personally, my expectations of it were the title character would get the humiliation he deserves, ultimately see the error of his ways, and become a one-woman man. Instead, he not only uses his exes' attempts to discredit him to his advantage, but, much to my dismay and disappointment, even though he does get humiliated near the end and becomes honest afterward, he's still a player (in reality, IMO, no teenage girl would truly go after a guy like that, no matter how handsome or popular he is. And what's up the subplot about the lead female character's mom and her love life?) Bottom line: If you want a good revenge comedy where the man gets his just desserts and the woman comes out on top, stick to either The Fist Wives Club, She Devil, or The Other Woman.",John Tucker Must Die
106,robbie_hatch,"Nothing is learned, nothing is accomplished, and nothing is solved",5,31 July 2006,"John Tucker (Jesse Metcalfe) is a womanizing stud who likes to date multiple girls at once. When three of his ex-girlfriends find out about what he had done, they plot together with the new girl in town, Kate (Brittany Snow) in order to destroy John Tucker's reputation.Kate is considered the main character in the story as the movie opens with her narration. Kate lives with her single mother (Jenny McCarthy) who is constantly dating new guys that dump her after a short amount of time, which forces Kate's mom to move. It is for this reason that Kate is immune to John Tucker's charm, as he reminds her of every man that's ever left her mother.John's three ex-girlfriends, Carrie, Beth, and Heather (Arielle Kebbel, Sophia Bush and Ashanti, respectively), flock to Kate because she is the new girl and John Tucker has not yet dated her. They want John Tucker to actually fall in love with her, and then she will dump him, breaking his heart.All seems to be going well until Kate starts falling prey to John Tucker's charm. Then everything kind of doesn't go well, then things sort of start looking up, then everything's back to normal. There's no real sense of conflict at all...we understand that these girls are angry, but when all we really see them doing is standing around and complaining about John Tucker, we start hating them more for doing so little about it.Even the title of the movie is a lie, as the girls are not planning to really kill John Tucker (which would have made for a more interesting movie). In fact, in retrospect, the worst John Tucker had to endure was a few embarrassing moments, most of which are shown in the trailer.I also found it absurd that Kate was considered the ugly duckling who had never dated anyone, as I found her the prettiest girl out of the four and definitely the most personable and kind-hearted.But what am I complaining about? This is a teen movie, and therefore, there will be beautiful faces everywhere, and bare-bones stereotypes of both men and women (including an awful scene in the men's locker room).With all that said, I can't say that I hated John Tucker Must Die, as it does manage to crank out some decent lines and jokes in the dialogue. Also, I was never really bored while watching the movie, I just wasn't blown away. I got exactly what I expected from it.In the end, no one in this movie learns a lesson, no one changes, and no one really takes anything from the experience of ""destroying"" John Tucker. But why should they have?",John Tucker Must Die
107,PatrickFitzHenry,Through the eyes of a lesbian.,1,30 July 2006,"It would be nice if they used well-known actors. The movie seems to be geared toward a lesbian's point of view of the situation. The cinematography and direction seems to be amateurish. The subject-matter seems very juvenile and cruel in nature. This movie is obviously made for the freshman girl high-schooler crowd. The only reason a guy would go to this movie is if he were dragged there by his girlfriend. If a guy went to this movie by himself, he would probably try to make sure that nobody saw him there and slip out unseen just when the ending credits start, if he didn't run out long before that. If this movie had more mature characters, it would be a great movie about playing cruel tricks on men for lesbians to see and celebrate.",John Tucker Must Die

But I found the film highly enjoyable and surprisingly, much better than I'd been expecting. A lot of the things the girls did were very mean and personally, I don't think half of it would have worked. But as a teenage girl who has recently been cheated on by my boyfriend of eight months, it was a lot of fun.

A lot of the scenes we're absolutely hilarious and everything else, and I loved it how the director made it so funny.

The acting was not bad, in fact, I thought it was quite good, especially Kate (the main character), I haven't seen her around in many films, but maybe that's just me. Ashanti, I guess, sorta ruined the film with her poor acting.

A movie with a guy with his hand on his own bare bum, a movie like that should be rated over 18's.

It's definitely not a classic, dark comedy like 'Heathers' (highly recommended) or as vengeful and intelligent as 'Election', but its cute nonetheless. Sure, everyone in the 'John Tucker Must Die' high school is gorgeous, no one has acne, everyone is a stereotype, and everyone wears designer clothing...but aren't all teen movies like that?

With stereotypical characters, predictable plot, hardly passable humor and average acting skills, it is not a masterpiece that will leave you amazed.

Britany Snow was very good and a great choice not to put in an actress like Hilary Duff or any of the better known young actress. John Tucker was overall a good experience and I would recommend it to any girl, because you can basically relate to at least one of the female leads, whether you are a vegan teen activist, a smart overachiver, the cheerleader, or just the unknown girl next door.I will also say that it is not a typical teen flick with lots of sex, drugs, and violence, etc. My mother saw the movie after I did and she agreed that it was a cute story and the film, which could have been much worse, was overall a good movie.",John Tucker Must Die

Its definitely a high school movie, for me I enjoyed seeing it in the movie, and I would go see it again. Maybe not buy the movie, but see another time sure why not. The movie really is a good back to school movie with a few twists and turns.

Jock boy who the 3 girls want to 'kill' falls for unpopular girl. Unpopular girl likes him during the job. After the plan is successful, 3 girls are best friends forever!

There is a handful of funny scenes that will make you pee your pants, but you'll be too tired cringing at the horrible acting to even laugh.Surprinsingly, Sophia Bush who plays the vegan slut Beth, wasn't that bad. And this is coming from a Sophia hater. She plays the part well, adding the touch of bitchy in her voice when a cat fight between her character, Ashanti's character, and Aribelle's character occurs.Ashanti ... all I have to say about her is, stick to singing.Brittany was so cute playing the clueless new girl! Her stuttering voice and nervous expression when talking to Jesse's character, her clueless face when she's with the 3 girls, and her devious expression when telling Jesse's character to wear the thong. Brittany Snow was awesome.The horrible acting, the weak storyline, and the cliché moments, made me give this movie a rating of 2/10.The funny scenes, the horrible acting, and the cliché moments, make this movie, a perfect teen flick, which will cause all the teenie bops, who 'luv' and idolize Ashanti/Sophia, and who think Jesse is the hottest thing in the planet, to rush to theaters.

We were definitely the oldest people in the theatre. The plot starts out interestingly enough, but then they dive head-first into the meat of the movie (the girls find out about each other). Within twenty minutes it's obvious where the movie will go. It was interesting to see the mass exodus of bored teenage guys leave after the mediocre kiss between two of the female characters. They lasted 45 minutes, so bravo boys, go get some Natty Light. The director must have realized that a positive moral value should be crammed in at the end making it incredibly predictable. It's not worth even the student price to see it, but it might be a good second video rental on margarita...er...Diet Coke and pizza night.

At the end of the 89 minutes you'll probably just be thinking that John Tucker should just move to Utah.",John Tucker Must Die

I guess I didn't do LSD before it or something because this movie was absolutely and totally horrendous. It is amazing that something so cliché, so terribly acted, with such a terrible story line and stupid stupid dialogue could ever be approved of by others! I see comparisons to Mean Girls, that movie was actually good and pretty well acted. That movie was at least interesting. This movie blatantly tried to copy Mean Girls in certain parts. The girls are the worst actors I have ever seen. This should have been a B-movie of National Lampoons except it doesn't have any nudity and the girls aren't' attractive. Usually I like Teen Movies with stupid humor, but I wish I had my money back. I wish I had those awful two hours back. I wish. But, like ""A Perfect Storm"", I will never be given that time back in my life so I hope that this comment dissuades people from seeing this movie and wasting their time. I am ""Paying it Forward"" to all those people bored and willing to spend $10 on a movie. Please do not see this, you will be stupider for it.",John Tucker Must Die
130,visualize_07,This movie is about three high school girls that want to get revenge on a guy that played them.,8,28 July 2006,"My view on this movie is jaded because yes, I am a teenage girl, but I really liked it. Some of the jokes were cheesy, but over all I really enjoyed it. Unlike some movies, it didn't lack a plot, and the script was well written (for a teen audience, not necessarily for an older audience.) Some people won't like John Tucker Must Die because of the fact that it is directed toward a younger audience, but most could appreciate its comedic value. I liked the way that this movie portrays high school, it is actually fairly accurate unlike some current teen movies. Some may argue that a high school guy couldn't possibly date that many girls and have them not find out, but, with the sizes of schools, and the likelihood of social circles never mingling, it leads me to believe that there could be many John Tuckers in schools everywhere. This would be a great movie to see with a group of friends if you're looking for a laugh. Overall I would rate this movie 8 out of 10.",John Tucker Must Die
131,fivegalaxies,"You put my heart in blender, but I hope we can be friends? WTF?",1,18 November 2006,"I liked the premise: girls decide against the default Jerry Springer response of fighting over a player, and band together to destroy evil. The user, the liar, the playa. He's going' down.They turn it into a sappy ""everybody learns a lesson in the end"" thing, where Tucker finally learns it's bad to lie and manipulate girls to get into their pants, dump them and repeat with another chump. His exes all find out the boy has a heart. All is forgiven with a food fight to relieve all the bad vibes.I was hoping the movie was about the real deal. These guys don't just exist in high school, they're everywhere. They're not just guys, girls do it too. Playas are the mercenary, shallow people who enjoy using up the people around them, dating a half dozen or so people simultaneously and playing them against one another for the sheer joy of the chaos it creates. They look for people they can see need a friend and a lover, pretend to be that, then take it away because they enjoy causing pain, or just really don't care as long as they're on top, and somebody else is on the bottom. They have no souls, no empathy or compassion for others.Man, the playas got the gangsta rap, and the gucci, and the armani. I was hoping this would be for the rest of us, the people at the bottom of the pyramid. I was hoping these girls were going to literally kill John Tucker. That boy needed killin'. Clint Eastwood style. At least he shoulda had to actually endure some real and lasting pain.Nope. This coulda been a great movie. Instead they gave the villain a heart of gold, and he gets to be buddies with the heroes in the end. Stupid. Just plain stupid.",John Tucker Must Die

They were all young and appealing to the teenage audience, and that definitely drew people to the movie and the movie itself kept people in their seats. Jesse McCalte (is that his name? sorry I'm not sure) was great. I liked Sophia Bush and Ashanti in their roles too.

When I first saw the previews for this movie I thought that it was going to be nothing but complete sexual content, after seeing it however I discovered that is not the case.

You could say its like the movie Mean Girls. Not the story plot, but like the rating. And I myself enjoy those movies. I wouldn't recommend this movie to someone that is like a total Grammy award movies freak, cause its not. Its just a movie that you would go watch with your friends on a Friday night.

I fully enjoyed it, and it is now my favorite movie of all time. Hilariouuus. The 4 main actresses play very well of each other, and are all very funny. Jesse Metcalfe, granted is not a gifted actor, is funny and does a good job of playing the hot, popular guy. Seriously, go out and see it you won't regret it.

I would have to say this movie is more for females than males. But then again if a guy wanted to see some pretty nice looking girls they just might like it. Plus it might give them some insight as to how a girl gets even. LOL. I gave it an 8 out of 10 because I can't say it was the ""Best"" movie I've ever seen.

But don't worry it doesn't have a corny overt moral or anything.Brittany Snow as Tucker's dream girl is simply great and I hope she stars in some more movies soon.Basically this movie is pretty funny (surprisingly) and full of laughs.

Yes, I do know that they were finding Herpes funny, but i think it might have helped in a way. I mean, it in a way helps kids realize that they're not alone if they do have an STD and that some people have come to except it more. And i know someone left a message asking if this was appropriate for 7th graders. Where I'm from, 7th graders are only 12 and the last time i checked the rating on this movie was PG-13 so technically 7th graders shouldn't even be watching this movie. And yes, some of the content is similar to 'Mean Girls' but at least in this movie their isn't a mom whose letting girls drink alcohol and their's no book about girls they hate. And Jenny McCarthy as the mother worked for the plot. It's where all the jerks go for the hot woman with the big boobs. It's kind of like portraying what's happening at school in the movie. But, something that I think would help, is I believe someone mentioned, is having the girl be the one who cheated, not the guy.",John Tucker Must Die
148,GinaDiazDeLeon,"Decent, humorous, good for middle school ages and up",7,6 August 2006,"When I saw the promos for this movie I thought they were kind of funny, but didn't really think of this as a ""worthwhile"" movie. I saw it as kind of a First Wives Club meets Heathers movie.Well, today my daughter-in-law & I took my 13 yr old daughter to see it and it was a blast. Jesse Metcalfe plays John Tucker. He portrayed one of the boy toys on Desperate Housewives and has been on both Smallville and Passions . I wasn't really expecting much from him.He surprised me. He was able to portray several challenging roles as the title character. He was very convincing as the fast-talking, popular, pretty-boy, MVP of the basketball team and legendary Lothario of the school. Once the women scorned start taking their revenge, he was able to portray the responses very convincingly.Brittany Snow, from American Dreams, does an excellent job of narrating and her character is much more convincing as the tool of revenge than Lindsay Lohan's was in Mean Girls, and I thought Lindsay did a fairly good job. The most critical thing I have to say is that her voice is a little too high & squeaky for me.Jenny McCarthy plays the sexy, single, caring, jerk-magnet of a mom and she is more than up to the challenge. She doesn't have much screen time, but what little bit she has, she uses extremely well to portray the all-to-human yet wiser for the experience, mom who's not concerned about the superficialities of her daughter's choice but who's concerned about her character and her heart.Penn Badgley who plays the younger brother of the high school Lothario is very compelling and down to earth without ever being a stereotype. Which is more than I can say for the jilted girlfriends, played by Ashanti, Sophia Bush, and Arielle Kebbel. However, their roles were expressly written to be stereotypes and the actresses did a good job of genuinely portraying them.I think anyone who's ever been to high school, regardless of their role, clique, or experience can find something to connect to in this movie. It has a conscience and a moral, but it keeps it pretty real.The soundtrack is full of current groups and includes music from The All-American Rejects, Motion City Soundtrack, People In Planes, Cartel, Quietdrive and others. There are a couple of songs that are ""recycled"" from the 80's, such as Pat Benetar's ""Hit Me With Your Best Shot"" and Cindy Lauper's ""Time After Time."" As an 80's child, I automatically felt that the songs weren't right, especially since they were sung by males, but all in all they were done well.My rating: 3.5 stars out of 5",John Tucker Must Die

We found ourselves laughing out loud throughout the movie and came out thoroughly satisfied with this movie. It was definitely worth seeing and I didn't feel ripped off paying the night-time price.

Heather was a really good character by putting a spin on the whole ""lead cheerleader"" thing. i liked how Kate was the innocent unexperienced girl who thinks she is and panics at every move. that makes her seem so real and not just some typical movie girl. beth was the natural, vegetarian girl with all of the morals that get smashed as soon as she goes out with ""john tucker"". and Carrie is the computer whiz who makes everything happen. its funny how their school doesn't have a dress code though. and last but not least is John who has the master mind plan to date people from different clicks so that they wont talk to each other. what he didn't think of was that they might be over heard by one of the other girls. overall a great movie!",John Tucker Must Die

So when I heard she was going to be in a comedy with the hot gardener from ""Desperate Housewives"", I was ecstatic! I waited months to see the movie and when I did, I was a little disappointed.My main issue with this movie is that I don't understand how Sophia Bush's character is supposed to be this independent, strong, ""Save The Wales!"" activist type of girl who seems like she wouldn't let a guy play her be an easy, slutty (thats what she says herself!) type of girl?! I mean I thought that was what the CHEERLEADER was for! Another issue that annoys me (and basically everyone else who has seen the movie) is that the ending is horrendous!!! For those who don't know, it goes like this: It's John Tucker's HUGE birthday party, Kate is John's date, the other three girls are there but they are keeping their distant away from Kate because they are mad at each other. John is talking about how great Kate is to hundreds of people. Then a video plays of Kate saying how ""There are many guys in the world but John Tucker, you ain't one of them"" (or something along those lines) and John looks at Kate with a ""WHAT?! I'M SO CONFUSED!"" expression on his face. Kate cracks and tells about how herself and his three ex girlfriends plotted to make him fall in love with Kate and then ""yank it away from him!"". John looks like he wants to either shoot Kate in the face for lying to him or run away like a little baby because he was embarrassed in front of basically everyone in town. So what does he do?! What does John Tucker do to the girl who made him fall in love with her and break his heart?! WHAT DOES HE DO TO THE GIRLS WHO LIED TO HIM AND MADE HIS LIFE HORRIBLE?!!? He throws cake. They have one huge cake fight. Everyone joins in. John, the girls, everyone is laughing and giggling and throwing birthday cake. When I saw this, I could not believe my eyes. WHAT IN THE WORLD!?!?! Are you KIDDING me?! At that moment I could of thought of about 7 other perfect endings for the movie. I was extremely disappointed and frankly, it ticked me off.But the movie IS great! It has really funny moments and scenes. So don't give up on it just because the ending is stupid. The dynamics between the characters is humorous and classic.

Maybe the character John Tucker is a bit unrealistic but he seems to fit and is hilarious to watch!! Of course there is still somewhat of a cliché so if you're not in to the teen kind of movies don't see it. But if you love a laugh and a laid-back comedy, go right ahead!!

If I was one of them he wouldn't live to see the day, but that's the warrior princess in me speaking. I would consider boys would probably stay clear of this unless you are one of those strange types who loves girlie fun like Mean Girls. John Tucker Must Die and Mean Girls have said to be rivals as they are so similar but everyone will say the John Tucker is better only because by now we have all seen Mean Girls so many times we're glad for a change, but with a slightly wittier a plot John Tucker would probably win my vote even if they had both come out at the same time.",John Tucker Must Die

161,BladeTheMovieGuy,Worst Movie Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1,6 April 2008,"I absolutely hated this movie. It was the worst movie Ever made. heres 5 reasons why I hated this movie.1. You know how movie titles fit in with the plot of the movie, like the Alien series was about an Alien killing people, well this movie should have been called John Tucker Gets Humiliated. If you wanted to call it John Tucker Must Die you should have made it an action movie.2. The direction was horrible.3. The acting was poor. That was the worst acting I have ever seen in a movie. Brittany Snow, Ashanti, Sophia Bush, and Jesse Metcalfe were bad in this movie.4. It wasn't funny for one second. Well I did laugh once but it was because this movie was horrible.5. I had to watch it in school. That is also why I hated it. I had to watch a bad movie in school.Those are 5 reasons John Tucker Must Die is the worst movie ever made.1/10 - Poor acting, Bad Direction, Not Funny, Had to watch it in school.",John Tucker Must Die
162,bssyboo,Laugh Out Loud Teen Comedy,8,29 May 2008,"OK...So it wasn't exactly ""American Pie"" but its a good film to watch on a Friday night when there's nothing on t.v and you and a few mates just want to chill out in front of the t.v and have a laugh. The acting in it is alright, there no ""Julia Roberts"", but there decent and all the cast look like there enjoying themselves. John (Jesse Metcalfe) plays the typical, hot, popular all American high school boy who's head of the basket ball team and obvious man candy. Whilst Kate (Brittany Snow) is the hopeless and clumsy, invisible, new girl.John is a player. He's got three girls on the go; Heather(Ashanti), Head cheerleader and the hottest girl in the school, Beth (Sophia Bush), Actavist and Carrie (Arielle Kebbel), Know it all and student body president,...all from different cliques so that the other, wont find out. He tells them that his dad won't let him date during basket ball season so no-one can know about them secretly seeing each other. But when a violent, but very hilarious, volley ball match leads to them finding out that he's dating all three of them, they want to get even...So it's not th best film i've ever seen, but it will definitely leave you laughing and with a few unexpected surprises in store its the perfect chick flick for a night in with the girls!",John Tucker Must Die
163,claneggsaladperson,This film had a little touch to it...,8,12 November 2011,"I don't honestly want to say this is the best movie in the world, but I will admit that the movie had a kind of ""touchy-feely"" effect. It had some heart in it. It was not just another crappy teen comedy/drama film. The acting is pretty good, and the characters are good too. The movie came off to me as a good film, nothing less. It touched me, made me actually feel, and it even made me smile. It is genuinely a good film. I recommend this movie to people. This is definitely not the kind of movie you'd sit through and feel like time was wasted at the end, at least for most people I'd assume. It has comedy, drama, crude humor, and it's definitely not ""cheap.""8/10 rating for me. Definitely an enjoyable-worthy film. :)",John Tucker Must Die
164,mo-8975,sometimes weak but extremely funny,6,4 November 2010,"I thought this film was a genuinely funny, daft teen comedy. While there are parts of the film that the plot weakens and this is covered by the attractive cast members (Metcalfe taking his shirt off for example) there are also many moments that are really laugh-out-loud funny. It is quite clearly aimed at teenagers and may not appeal to people outside this age bracket but personally i thought that it accepted it was only a daft teen comedy and didn't try to take itself too seriously and become anymore than what it is. I found this hilarious and still do when re-watching it. I would recommend it, but only to people who aren't looking for anything serious or deep and just want a good laugh.",John Tucker Must Die
165,ameriefan19,Great Date Movie!,8,28 July 2006,"""John Tucker Must Die"" is a great movie to go out with friends to see or to go on a date for. Comparisons to ""Mean Girls"" will be inevitable though. From the voice overs, to the change of Kate's character, to the way the girls try to sabotage John, you will see a lot of it drew inspiration for that movie. Brittany Snow is likable as Kate and the rest of the girls flow together well. Teens will definitely enjoy it and parents dragged along will find that movie moves fast and is over soon enough (although as a caution to any parents reading this-there is definitely a reason this movie is rated PG-13 and most of it has to do with sexual content.) Some of the funniest scenes involve John being sabatoged-whether its his emotional breakdown while playing basketball or having to strip down to a thong, they got the most laughs. ""John Tucker Must Die"" is a cut above teen movies that are normally made- the characters seem real and the dialogue is funny. This movie is viciously funny.",John Tucker Must Die
166,LifeEqualsCheese,Cute.,4,6 August 2006,"I walked into this movie not expecting much, and I wasn't disappointed. I enjoyed it because it was entertaining and even funny at times. What I found most appealing, though, was that I could match up some of these characters to my own high school peers: The star athlete who's a jerk, but treated like a God; the popular girls who fawn over the guy for the title of being their boyfriend. I liked that they really hit it close to home on the characterization.The acting was nothing spectacular, but it was decent. Brittany Snow played the cute innocent girl well, and I could relate to her character as the 'invisible' girl. Jesse Metcalf wasn't bad at being 'the reformed jerk', and Penn Badgley was a convincing overshadowed little brother. Ashanti, Sophia Bush, and Arielle Kebble were okay, and although their voices could be a little irritating at times, they played the manipulation well.If you're looking for a cinematic hit that'll win awards and make you think, this is definitely not it. But if you just want something cute and entertaining, or if you just like the 'happily-ever-after' fairy tale aspect of teen movies, it's not a bad pick.",John Tucker Must Die
167,epurdles,"Cute funny movie, see for yourself",8,30 July 2006,"Not as bad as people would have you believe. No, it won't win any awards but its a cute movie and clean as far as teen movies go these days. I took my 14 year old daughter and never felt the need to cover her eyes or ears, not the case with most PG-13 movies nowadays. Some of them make ME blush.I will say that Ashanti is ill cast here, she does not look like a teenage girl by any stretch of the imagination, nor does she look like she would remotely be the love interest of the title character, there was zero chemistry. Not to mention she had on a ton of makeup and wearing a horrendous wig. That's my biggest gripe, they could have chosen any of several pretty young AA actresses that would have done a better job.It had a great message too, so don't let bad reviews stop you from seeing it. I really enjoyed it and I was totally prepared not to.",John Tucker Must Die
168,courts1993,Fab movie but disappointing ending,8,4 October 2006,"Hey everyone! For a teen flick this was really good! It had an interesting plot and had very defined characters. The movie kept me entertained and i could relate to it very easily, however some parts were far fetched.Its a real heart warmer but the ending could've been a lot better. I didn't understand the ending as they got really close. Although we hate girl meets boy they get married, this movie could've played that up more. I went and saw this with my cousin and she really enjoyed it as well because we are both teens and we thought the girls emotions were portrayed very truthfully and it had very different characters in it. A hilarious movie all-in-all, and i wouldn't mind a sequel.",John Tucker Must Die
169,Sarbear1192-1,John Tucker= Fabulous Movie,8,28 July 2006,"I don't know what you guys are talking about. I think that this was a great movie! It was funny and true. It showed us just how life can be. I mean the movie had some interesting parts EX. The part in the jeep. But you can clearly see they weren't lesbians. And I actually found that part in the movie quite funny. Plus, I have heard nothing bad about it until I read all these bogus comments from you mindless people. When I left the theater everyone was raving about how good they thought it was. I also ran into some friends and they said ""Didn't you think it was really good? Oh I loved it!!"" So don't go bad talking it. I'd like to see you make a movie losers.",John Tucker Must Die
170,sarah_turner85,"Take Revenge on Summer Heat by Seeing ""Tucker""",6,7 August 2006,"I just saw ""John Tucker Must Die"" today, and although I will probably not buy this on DVD, I didn't mind buying a matinée-priced ticket to see this teen flick. The main cast, Jesse Metcalfe (John Tucker), Brittany Snow (Kate), Ashanti (Heather), Sophia Bush (Beth) and Arielle Kebbel (Carrie) are a solid ensemble who bring much energy to the film. I particularly enjoyed Metcalfe, who managed to make me hate and love him simultaneously. Stepping away from her typical over-the-top roles, Jenny McCarthy plays Kate's mother and gives a subdued performance. I also enjoyed the performance of Penn Badgley, who plays John Tucker's brother, the opposite of everything his brother is. This film contains several themes common in teen flicks: individuality is more important than popularity, honesty is the foundation to every relationship, revenge is more trouble than it's worth, it is always better to air out your problems on stage in front of the entire school with a microphone...OK, I'm kidding with that one. All of these themes seem to slap the audience in the face repeatedly yet are never realistically actualized. But most teen flicks (aside from ""Mean Girls"") have no chance of actually accomplishing any great message: they are simply about entertaining an audience for one-and-a-half to two hours, and in this ""Tucker"" does not fail. Guys will enjoy this film for all the delicious eye candy (look out for the much publicized kiss between Snow and Bush), and girls will enjoy this film for every man who has broken their hearts (look out for the scene where Metcalfe is caught pants-down sporting women's underwear). While it may not win any awards, it is a decent way to spend a summer afternoon otherwise spent sweating in the heat.",John Tucker Must Die
171,bigredflipperAM,"John Tucker isn't great, but a movie about seeking revenge on him is excellent.",8,29 July 2006,"John Tucker Must Die is one of the best movies in its genre in awhile. This movie is so adorable and full of All-American girl charm and teenage girl hormonal rages. I loved every minute of it and my expression were clear to the 5 other people in the theater with me (small town).The two young guys who attended seemed to be into the hot chicks. Another pair of people behind me did not see interested and seemed to be hoping for more of an American Pie sort of thing instead of Mean Girls rendezvous. My friend found the movie entertaining and more than she expected.The acting was novel and at time I wondered if they were my friends. The characters were so relatable. Scott Tucker was so captivating and definitely more of a heartthrob than John Tucker. The main female character Brittany Snow was perfect for the role of Kate. She was so fun to watch on screen. Ashanti, in the movie, was too cocky and mean if though she was playing the head cheerleader. Sophia Bush was promiscuous, yet had a somewhat innocent flair.This movie was well worth my time. Now I want to find someone to see it again with me.",John Tucker Must Die
172,Soccermimi08,this movie is..,9,29 July 2006,"oh my goodness! this movie is great! the preview looked so entertaining right from the start i was in watching click when it came on and i turned to my friend and was like we have to see that i saw it opening night and fell in love what better way to show how some guys really act? you may think this guy is all that but if u really look at him you see that he is not. its very realistic. the girls have great minds. Brittany snow played a very good part she was definitely right for it. Jesse metcalfe did amazing. this movie was very good and u definitely did laugh out loud, its not only made for girls but guys too. you will love this movie. i am buying it the moment it hits DVD.",John Tucker Must Die
173,greatbuffy,Good entertainment,10,2 October 2006,"Just want to say that I am 22 years old, but I (and also my friend) think that in my head I'm always 15. That's may be why I think it is a very good movie. It is a very good entertainment because it has a quite good scenario, a very good cast (everyone is beautiful), and a very good chemistry between the actors. The truth is that I didn't know what was the movie about when I went to see it, but I really had a good time when I watched it. It may be not the smartest or the funniest but personally, I really enjoy the movie, and I think that is all this movie is about : just to have fun while watching it. So thank you the cast and of course the writers and producers.",John Tucker Must Die
174,kimberlyvogel,SOOOOO Good!!,10,7 August 2006,"I thought that this movie was excellent. It was funny and romantic and I recommend it highly. The characters were well thought out and I thought that the writing was witty. It would be good for teenagers of any age maybe not so much the young ones but I sure did like it. I remember laughing out loud many times throughout the movie and so was everyone else in the theater. I personally think you are crazy if you think that this is a bad movie but that is my personal opinion. But before you think to criticize I think you should watch it first then decide that you hate it. Plus there are hot guys in it and how can you go wrong there, right? Go see it!!",John Tucker Must Die
175,annarust,I love this movie! The best I've seen in a LONG time!,10,21 January 2007,"I saw this movie with my two friends - a perfect girly night, popcorn, shopping, cinema - and we were laughing our way through the whole movie. some people could call it a ""rom-com"" yeah yeah - OK, it was one - but a really funny one.I loved it so much - Brittany was great, Ashanti - all the rest - a really funny movie! I liked the fact it wasn't a ""Hollywood Ending"" when John & (Brittany) end up not staying together. When you see this movie, wait till the end of the credits, trust me, you'll be happy you stayed :) Altogether - REALLY FUNNY AND BRILLIANT MOVIE!!!!",John Tucker Must Die
176,nemo-61,A great film and a great laugh,10,12 September 2006,"People who have rated this film badly don't know what they're talking about. I went ans watched it and it is the best and the funniest film I've seen in ages. Many of my friends have seen it too (most separately to me) and have agreed that it is a great film.It is about teenagers and for teenagers, so maybe it is best if it's a teenager (like me) who rates it? The cast is amazing and the storyline is believable. Jesse Metcliffe pulls off being the sort of guy who girls don't mind if they're not him only girl friend, and looks totally cute whilst doing it.How COULD this be a bad film??????",John Tucker Must Die
177,lieslrene1,Teenage Movie Formula,3,28 July 2006,"Its the typical teenager movie. Unpopular girl becomes popular, snobby girls become unpopular girls friend just to crush the unpopular girl in the end leading to the feel good fairytale ending! PLEASE spare me! I honestly wasn't totally turned off while watching it, there were some funny parts I could laugh at and the story moved pretty quick. But there were some parts that were really unrealistic. First of all the fact that a girl like Kate(Brittany Snow) didn't have any friends was pretty phony! The fact that the head cheerleader HAS to date the basketball captain is just so cliché. The thing that I really couldn't get past was the stupid Boom Mic!!! It was in so many scenes it was almost laughable. Who ever edited this movie might be in the wrong career! If I was staring in this movie I would have been humiliated at the premier!",John Tucker Must Die
178,qt_nessa_numba1,GOOD...until the ending !!,6,28 July 2006,"I laughed and smiled throughout the whole movie!! John Tucker Must Die was a pretty good movie,not the best though. The kind of movie that you go see with your pals on a Saturday night. The kind of movie that you rent when you throw a pajama party or that you watch when it's a rainy day. I'd give this move an 9 out of 10 but the ending was so bad and cliché that the whole movie became a 6 out of 10, and I'm being generous (because of Jessie Metcalfe=)). First off, the documentary that the girls have been filming about John Tucker hasn't had been showed entirely at his birthday party, because Kate came to her senses her stopped it. STUPID. At least, the whole documentary could've been showed... And secondly, PLEASE!! Don't tell me that John fell in love Cate, and after Kate revealed her lies to him, he decides all of sudden (i mean it, all of a sudden) to become honest about dating girl and whatnot. SURE... Anyway, the movie is pretty good and entertaining, i just wished i had the brilliant idea of getting out of the theater before the cheesy ending lol!!!",John Tucker Must Die
179,sternsuks1997,John Tucker cracked us up,10,5 August 2006,"I just saw this movie tonight in the theaters and we had a fantastic time. I haven't been to a great movie in a while - John Tucker Must Die was funny, charming and well made. Jesse Metcalfe, who is delicious, (an NYU grad!) and Brittany Snow were great - believable characters in an exaggerated high school environment (more realistic than the high school times of The OC). I also enjoyed Ashanti (surprisingly good), Sophia Bush (spirited), Penn Badgley (unbelievable as Metcalfe's brother...I mean, come on), and the other actress as supporting cast members. My friend and I (and the rest of the theater)laughed hysterically every few minutes. The decibel level of our laughter almost cracked my glasses. The plot was smart, never imposing, and completely charming, so watch this and reminisce about high school, or enjoy this light and cheery showcase of young talent!",John Tucker Must Die
180,greekgodess444,i've seen better,5,5 October 2007,"John Tucker Must Die was an OK film....and unfortunately no more... Like most teen flicks today it was mediocre....I will not deny that there were some funny moments in the film but that was pretty much it....it was made passable by the performances of the ensemble which i must admit was a really good cast!however the film, particularly the last 1/2 hour was average...the climax was not a climax at all......just a few moments of drama and humiliation and thats it.....the ending was a MAJOR let down.... i will not spoil anything but you are left sitting there thinking thats it!!!!overall it was an average movie........and so it receives and average mark of 5/10",John Tucker Must Die

My brother who is 17 enjoyed it. I enjoyed it the most however and I am 14 nearing 15. The central plot of John Tucker (Jesse) cheating on these girls was something that is possible and many movies don't really show it from both sides. All the actors were great and it was a great movie for all ages. The director and writer did a great job on this movie but especially the writer. The script was amazing, I am really amazed at the writers ability. I have bought this movie and definitely recommend everyone to watch the commentary. It's amazing.",John Tucker Must Die

A girl sees a guy who cheats on his girlfriends, and tries to destroy him. They all band together and come up with an outrageous plan to destroy his reputation. Has to be good... right? No. After about the first ten minutes the movie goes downhill, as the plot doesn't hold water. The 3 scenes in the movie that will make you laugh aren't worth the hour and a half. And when you take all that away, you've got a film about a teenager having a food fight at his birthday, taking estrogen, and wearing panties.Stay away from this film.",John Tucker Must Die
