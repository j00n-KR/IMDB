0,kosmasp,And the Dead,9,26 June 2021,"I do not know the book this is based on - so I can't compare how faithful it is to the book. It does seem to take certain characters and manages to put them in the film though - I can imagine that the hotel owner is in the book too ... and what a fine casting they did on him - and all the other people too of course. Eric Banas father in this ... I could see him as his real father (judging from the last names it does not seem to be the case though).So great actors and a really good story to say the least. It may start off quite dry ... and it does take its sweet time. But it uses the time to introduce us to the people involved and makes us second guess every move, every word and everyone we see ... is there more to him or her? Very likely ... a town/village full of lies ... lies to protect oneself or a loved one ... secrets that haunt almost everyone. Secrets that seem laughable, but could hurt someones reputation ... and other sins (not just from the father(s)) ... a really well done, dry movie, with a powerhouse performance by Eric Bana, but also anyone else that is on screen at any given time!",The Dry
1,grantss,Interesting crime drama,7,4 October 2021,"A policeman, Aaron Falk, returns to his small home town for a funeral. Three people from the same family died in what appears to be a murder-suicide. Falk was best friends at school with Luke, the husband accused of the murders. The return, his first in over 20 years is not a happy one, bringing up memories of and anger from another death, one he was accused of.Interesting Australian crime drama. Decent plot and reasonably engaging. The whodunnit side is not obvious, making for an intriguing journey.Solid performance from Eric Bana in the lead role and decent supporting performances.Not brilliant though: is a bit long-winded and the plot isn't entirely watertight. While reasonably intriguing, the tension is lacking, giving the feeling that things are happening in a vacuum. The drawn-out nature of proceedings doesn't help the momentum or tension.Still very watchable though.",The Dry
2,ferguson-6,not a dry Aussie whodunit,7,20 May 2021,"Greetings again from the darkness. Remember when an exonerated OJ Simpson vowed to dedicate his time to finding ""the real killer"" of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman? For some reason that memory came back in the early stages of this film as a Melbourne-based Australian Federal Police agent returns to his isolated hometown after his childhood friend is implicated in a murder-suicide. See, that agent left town as a teenager when he was suspected of being involved in the murder of a local teenage girl.Eric Bana (MUNICH, 2005) stars as that AFP agent Aaron Falk. He's been gone for 20 years, but agrees to return for the funeral of his friend Luke (Martin Dingall Wall) at the request of Luke's parents (Bruce Spence, Julia Blake). The parents don't believe Luke would have killed his wife and one of his two kids and then committed suicide, and they want Luke to investigate. Of course, the rest of the town believes Luke did it, and most are none too happy that Aaron has returned, as they haven't forgotten the suspicion tied to him for the tragedy that took the life of his friend Ellie (BeBe Bettencourt) so many years ago.The stark contrast of glass and steel Melbourne towers and the drought-stricken cracked soil of (fictional) Kiewarra are as distinct as the comparison of today's Kiewarra with Aaron's flashbacks to those carefree days of swimming in the river with Ellie, Luke and their friend Gretchen - who is now a single mom played by Genevieve O'Reilly, and one of the few to welcome Aaron back. The film is based on the 2016 international best-selling novel by Jane Harper, and there is a lot to keep up with, despite a pace that never feels rushed. The two cases may be separated by twenty years, but they seem connected, even though we aren't sure how murder and suicide and a slew of suspects all fit together. Aaron works with local police officer Greg Raco (an excellent Keir O'Donnell) in an attempt to make sense of what's happened.There are angry and suspicious people throughout the town. William Zappa plays Mal, Ellie's grudge-bearing father, while Matt Nable plays her obnoxious and quick-to-accuse cousin Grant. James Frecheville (ANIMAL KINGDOM, 2010) is local farmer with a motive Jamie Sullivan, while John Polson plays school Principal Scott Whitlam who isn't quite as put together as he'd like everyone to believe. Farmer Sullivan remarks (with the film's best line), ""You think you're gonna get the truth in a town like this?"" And by that time, we know exactly what he means.The flashbacks to Aaron's teenage years provide much of the context to the story and his character, and they are handled beautifully. It's a small town whose residents hold an abundance of secrets, rumors, and grudges, creating a web of misinformation that challenges Aaron and Officer Raco. The two cases (past and present) collide, and cinematographer Stefan Duscio does terrific work with the vast, dusty landscape, as well as the many interior shots where the characters reveal their true selves. Writer-director Robert Connolly (a heavy TV workload recently) co-wrote the script with Harry Cripps and Samantha Strauss, and they have created a suspenseful and entertaining whodunit. With the heavy dose of crime shows on TV these days, it's a pleasure to see a well done film with high production value and a cohesive story. Just remember to use an alibi other than ""shooting rabbits"", if you are ever working on a cover story.Opening in theaters and on VOD on May 21, 2021.",The Dry
3,bombersflyup,"""Good stuff.""",7,5 November 2021,"The Dry engages throughout, though turns everything on its head after some time.Bana solid in the lead role, his character takes leaps though and seems certain of them. Can only assume he'll let it be known in the end, as he takes the bag with him. It shouldn't really have ended there though, as it fails to fully resonate. Unusual to have consistent flashbacks with half those in the flashbacks dead and one of those depicted as the villain all the way. A tad PC, it is however one of the best film's of the year and worthwhile.",The Dry
4,MOscarbradley,Serviceable but hardly original.,6,18 October 2021,"I'm sure the Australian outback isn't quite as bad as it's painted in the movies but in film after film it seems to be a landscape full of ignorant rednecks, or whatever the Aussie equivalent is, who are capable of the most extreme violence at the drop of a wide-brimmed hat. The latest addition to what is now almost a genre in its own right is Robert Connolly's ""The Dry"" which begins with an apparent murder/suicide and continues with the subsequent investigation by city cop and friend of the family involved, Eric Bana, still looking remarkably fresh-faced at fifty-two. It's an investigation that's tied up with the death of another girl years before and in which Bana may have been involved.It's a slow-paced, reasonably well-acted movie, beautifully shot by Stefan Duscio. The problem is we've been here before. I know there's nothing new under the sun but a good murder mystery needs originality and a bit of a kick and this doesn't really have either. It's certainly very watchable and it never insults our intelligence; it's just never very exciting. The title, ""The Dry"", refers to the fact that it hasn't rained in almost a year.",The Dry
5,A_Different_Drummer,Delivers,8,6 April 2021,Bana has never given a bad performance and Connelly has an almost poetic touch on the visuals. A throwback to the days when half the job of a good film was to keep the viewer's attention.,The Dry
6,The-Sarkologist,Dark Secrets in Small Town Australia,8,4 January 2021,"I guess the main reason that I ended up going and seeing this film was simply because of Eric Bana. Then again, he does happen to have that sort of pulling power. Okay, it was also an Australian film, but honestly, I generally don't go and see films simply because they are Australian because, well, Australian films simply don't seem to have that much of a pulling power to me. However, I will admit that the trailers did catch me, so I guess that is why I ended up watching it.Well, it turned out to be pretty good. In fact, what surprised me was that this was one of the most packed theatres that I have seen since Theatres reopened in Melbourne. Half the time it was just me and a couple of other people, but I guess Australian films, and Eric Bana, really do have that ability to get people back into the cinemas. I guess it is also a tribute to the fact that Australians will actually go and see Australian films, and there were even people in the cinema who commented that it was good.The film deals with two mysteries (and is based on a book), one that was recent, and another that occurred twenty years previously (which suggests that the action is set around 2011 or something like that). The setting is Western Victoria, and we are in the middle of an unprecedented drought (something that really wasn't the case back then, but then again the date isn't specifically mentioned, only implied), and of course Western Victoria has been hit pretty hard. Thus, when our protagonist's childhood friend is implicated in a murder/suicide, and his friend's parents pressure Aaron to look into it a bit more, he decides that he will extend his leave.I guess what this film does is that it does capture the life of a dying Australian town in the middle of a drought. Like, people comment on how in small towns everybody knows everybody else, but what this film seeks to capture is the darker side of this in that even though people know everybody, the reality is that there are a lot of dark secrets under the surface, secrets that will no doubt explode if they come to life. As one of the characters states, if you lie for long enough, you start to believe your lie. However, there is also this element of people simply looking the other way and not asking questions, which is why when an AFP officer, and one who has been implicated in the death of a young woman years ago, rocks up and starts asking questions, things start to get volatile.This is probably why it was set during a drought because in Australia droughts inevitably lead to bushfires, and the longer the land is dry, the more danger there is for a bushfire to start up. This is very much the analogy of the small town in that the secrets start to pile up, and eventually there will be a spark that will simply set everything off. Yet there is also this element of simply turning the other way, and taking the simplest explanation, even if it is just to prevent a conflagration.I guess the only part where this film fell down is that the ending seemed to be a bit lackluster, but I guess that is the case with many mystery movies. Things work really well when there is an element of mystery, and you are trying to work things out, and determine where things are going to go. However, once the truth is revealed, it is sort of somewhat disappointing. Still, for an Australian flick, it was pretty good and it is certainly well worth watching.",The Dry
7,Thanos_Alfie,Just watch it...,6,29 September 2021,"""The Dry"" is a Drama - Mystery movie in which we watch a man returning to his hometown after many years for a funeral. There he will face his past and he will have to deal with his old friends and a situation that isn't as it was presented.I liked this movie because it had a very interesting plot until the end of it, filled with some plot twists that I did not expect and some very good interpretations. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, Eric Bana who played as Aaron Falk was simply amazing and his interpretation made the difference. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Keir O'Donnell's who played as Raco, Genevieve O'Reilly's who played as Gretchen and John Polson's who played as Whitlam. All in all, I have to say that ""The Dry"" is a nice, mysterious movie that combines very well mystery with drama so, I strongly recommend you to watch it.",The Dry
8,eddie_baggins,A top class Australian mystery,7,4 January 2021,"A name that perfectly encapsulates both its setting and also the appearance of Robert Connolly's Australian film in the midst of a significant drought of good quality Australian productions, new local drama The Dry is one of the more memorable home grown feature films to appear in recent memory and a product that is likely to translate well overseas as its two for one whodunit mystery offers universal appeal.Adapting author Jane Harper's novel of the same name alongside co-screenwriter Harry Cripps, Balibo and Paper Planes director Connolly embeds the tale of Eric Bana's big city federal police officer Aaron Falk return to his barren hometown of Kiewarra with a strong sense of feeling and place, as the unforgiving dust strewn lands hide mysteries relating to Falk's past life in the community and the more recent tragic demise of his old friend Luke who is said to have committed suicide after murdering his wife and son.There aren't too many Australian films that could claim to have captured the small town rural community vibe better than Connolly does with The Dry, similarities could be made to classic Australian films like Wake in Fright or Red Dog and the town of Kiewarra (in reality communities filmed in the Wimmera region of the Australian state Victoria) and it's one of the films biggest wins as Falk and in turn the audience get acquainted with the various locals and mysteries that seemingly lie in wait at every corner he takes.Centre throughout most of this is the well-liked Bana who returns to the big screens in a strong way here in what's his first local performance since Romulus My Father back in 2007 and his Hollywood expertise and experience's certainly help add bite to Falk as a character, a quietly spoken and introverted thinker who slowly but surely morphs into someone we are rooting for along the way as his past becomes more apparent and future more desperate than ever.Accompanied with some stunning cinematography from Stefan Duscio (making this a film worth the big screen treatment) and a haunting score from Peter Raeburn as the films slowly paced plot unfolds, The Dry is as polished of a film as you're ever likely to get from a local production which makes it a shame some of its storytelling elements and supporting turns leave a little to be desired in an otherwise above average affair.The joys of films of this ilk is feeling a sense of unease and unknowing about who to trust and who may be hiding potentially nefarious motivations but The Dry can't seem to help itself from signposting big reveals that intended to surprise us later in the piece and there are a few performances within the film that commit the cardinal overacting sin that plagues most Australian features with the return of actor/director John Polson as the towns local principal most noteworthy in this regard, a shame as so much else within The Dry feels far more well-rounded.Final Say -A solid Australian offering that has global appeal and some fantastic elements, The Dry is one of the best local products to emerge in some time and a surefire winner for those seeking Aussie tinged dramatic mysteries.3 1/2 Tripadviser reviews out of 5",The Dry

11,jtindahouse,A plot that had me invested,8,27 April 2021,"'The Dry' was one of the first movies to come back into theatres in New Zealand after they closed for COVID-19 and it sat in theatres for months as basically the only thing they had to offer. Somehow though I never got around to going to it, even though I planned to on multiple occasions. It's not the type of movie that demands to be seen in a theatre. Nothing visually about it is special and the story isn't full of action by any means. But in terms of quality it would justify a cinema watch I would suggest.I commented back when the film came out that it was fitting that Eric Bana would do a film called 'The Dry' because I find him to be one of the driest actors working today. I was pleasantly surprised with his performance here however. He was still pretty understated to be fair, but I found him a good lead and very watchable. It's possible that this had more to do with how his character was written than anything else though to be fair.I liked the mystery elements to the film. I found myself very invested in the story and needing to know the conclusion. The mysteries are well disguised, however they are also a little underwhelming when they are finally revealed unfortunately. Nonetheless I had a very good time with 'The Dry' and would recommend you check it out when it becomes available in your region.",The Dry
12,billcr12,Silly Plot,3,21 May 2021,Eric Bana plays a 37 year old who returns to his hometown to investigate the death of his high school buddy from 20 years earlier. Mistake number one as the actor is 53. The flashbacks to the death of a girlfriend are maddening. The plot holes are huge and the two endings are just plain silly. There is no logic to the supposed reasons for the murders or the girls mysterious death. Save yourself the two hours of this slow and tedious film.,The Dry

14,henry8-3,The Dry,7,9 August 2021,"Eric Bana plays a federal cop drawn back to his home town where he is persuaded to investigate the massacre of a family apparently by an old friend. His presence is largely unwelcome though as he is believed to be responsible for the death of a girl 20 years earlier.Set in a tinder dry Australian township, this is an assured, solid mystery thriller which cleverly displays possible suspects so you never really sure what the answer is and where it lies as it twists and weaves as Bana finds new pieces of evidence. Bana is sharp and relatively reserved throughout with a good supporting cast rekindling old romances or wanting him gone for the crime he allegedly committed. It is all set in this dry world - you can almost feel the heat - reminiscent of the seventies Australian film renaissance films and particularly of course Picnic at Hanging Rock. I was particularly pleased as well that in the end the solutions to both crimes are laid properly bare, with the main crime featuring a particularly impressive piece of stunt / effects work to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion. Good film.",The Dry

17,arungeorge13,An Australian mystery crime drama that's well worth your time and attention! [+71%],7,8 May 2021,"The Dry, directed by Robert Connolly, is a compelling mystery drama thriller set in a desiccated Australian town. The film opens with the harrowing visuals of blood-soaked corpses and barren wastelands, indicating early on that there are quite a few secrets to unfurl. Aaron Falk (Eric Bana, who seems to be ageing gracefully) returns to his hometown to attend the funeral of his childhood friend Luke, who has apparently murdered his family before killing himself. On the insistence of Luke's parents, Aaron commences investigating the incident.A slow-burn whodunnit that effectively melds the past with the present, The Dry offers mysteries surrounding two separate incidents. It is entirely plot-driven, filled with intriguing exposition, and locales that serve as metaphorical subtext. Adapted from the 2016 novel by Jane Harper, the writers (Harry Cripps and Robert Connolly) fully trust the source material and its threaded nuances. The non-linear storytelling style totally befits the narrative here, divulging the intricacies of Aaron, Luke, Gretchen, and Ellie in an unhurried manner. I liked how the threads start to cohesively connect, with multiple characters (whom audiences can suspect) entering the picture.The town isn't kind to Aaron as they believe he's connected to the death of Ellie. Bana brings a great deal of restraint in his performance, maintaining a stoic vibe all through. His expressions and movements are what one could deem minimal-yet-effective. The flashback portions are well-acted and executed, further adding riveting layers. Peter Raeburn's score and Stefan Duscio's cinematography are worthy of mention. Marshland is a film that immediately came to mind after watching The Dry, for its narrative style and aesthetics.There's plenty to admire here, except for a super-late twist that comes off as a little too straightforward (for my taste). It's one of those journal-entry-reveals that would have worked fine in a more generic thriller, but here it feels like a rather convenient trope. Nevertheless, The Dry is still a recommended watch if you enjoy slow-paced, textured (crime drama) thrillers.",The Dry
18,omendata,Two rules for good movie-making - Does it evoke emotion from the viewer? and would you watch it again?,7,7 June 2021,"I have to admit, it is very rare that i watch an Aussie movie and find it is a bad one and this is no exception to the rule!This film literally drips with atmosphere and a pervading sense of sadness mixed with regret and soupçon of futility but with superb acting from all the cast weaving a rather languorous but stylish web of intrigue to hold the viewers gaze. Great photography and spellbinding music score that really conjures up the dry dustbowl that is the archetypal, central Australia backwater town, with its hidden dark secrets and creepy bill-hilly descendants of Botany Bay; so much so you can almost feel the oppressive heat and stifling atmosphere hemming you into your seat; just like PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK (1975) did all those year ago and with the same serious aplomb.It is a basic whodunnit story and not for the crash, bang , wallop brigade but
for those who like to sit back and be absorbed into the landscape and watch from a distance and it unfolds so methodically and with such a well paced, directed, photographed and acted ensemble that it is hard to stop watching. With a masterful performance and perfect casting of the always on form Eric Bana. I actually had a tear in my eye at the final denouement; always a great sign that a movie has done its job well. It made a superb nights viewing and a film I could watch again - for me that is another sign of a good movie!!!Highly recommended, one of the best films this year and anyone who has read Jan Harper's book will be happy as it has not been hacked to death as usually happens in the Hollywood movie-zone!",The Dry

Draught is really worrying and with the sun scorched vast fields with very scarce vegetation, the little town looked spooky. The bad locals doing heinous things in a little town feels so southern gothic. I really enjoyed it except for young Aaron didn't look like Aaron at all and it could have been about 20 minutes shorter.The motive was very infuriating. The principal was a gambler and he owed money to some dangerous people so he killed Luke, his son and his wife who worked as an account at the school. And Ellie didn't commit suicide and none of her friends were responsible, either. It was his father who killed her. Aaron found her bad in the crack between the rock tree by the lake. He read her diary and made sure it was her father. They kept blaming Aaron for her death when he came back for investigation the deaths.

24,tm-sheehan,Really 7.5 Good Australian Cinema impressive performances,7,16 January 2021,"My Review - The Dry
My Rating 7.5 /10The Dry is a very good Australian movie I haven't read the novel it's based on by Jane Harper so can't comment if it's a good adaptation of her book or not.
Eric Bana in one of the most subdued performances I've seen him give as Aaron Falk is very effective as the brooding Detective who returns to his childhood town Kiewarra to attend a tragic event.
Aaron Falk has been summoned by his childhood friend Luke's father Gerry (Bruce Spence ) to attend his son ,daughter in law and Grandsons funeral . Luke is the prime suspect in a suspected murder suicide that mercifully spared his young baby.
At the funeral wake Luke's mother (Julia Blake) asks Aaron to investigate the circumstances of her son and family's death,she refuses to believe Luke could kill himself and family.
That's enough of this complex plot no spoilers from me but as the story develops the pieces of the jigsaw concerning the mystery of what brings Aaron home but also another tragedy that haunts the Detective concerning a young girls drowning fall into place. The scorched town of Kiewarra is full of secrets and lies including the lie that has haunted Aaron since he left.
This film was sad to watch especially while yesterday's shocking murder suicide in Melbourne was fresh in our minds.
Jane Harper's ""The Dry"" is set in a parched Australian farming community within a day's drive of Melbourne. It's a region that hasn't seen rain in two years the films cinematographer Stephan Duscio has done a splendid job in capturing this arid dustbowl of Aaron's hometown .
There are some very impressive performances in The Dry and the Director and Screenplay writer Robert Connolly has done a good job in bringing The Dry to the screen . Readers of Jane Harper's book can judge if the screenplay does justice to the novel I suspect some of the unanswered questions I had at the end of the film are answered in the novel.",The Dry

28,MrDHWong,A haunting slow-burner that cleverly leads the audience along until its final reveal,8,15 July 2021,"""The Dry"" is a crime drama film based on the novel of the same name by Jane Harper. Starring Eric Bana in the lead role, it is a haunting slow-burner that cleverly leads the audience along until its final reveal.After more than twenty-years, federal agent Aaron Falk (Eric Bana) returns to his childhood hometown of Kiewarra, Victoria to attend the funeral of his old friend Luke (Martin Dingle-Wall), who is thought to have killed his wife and young son in a murder-suicide. Not believing their son is capable of such a crime, Luke's parents persuade a hesitant Aaron to stay in town to help them investigate the situation further. Aaron's research is frequently hampered not only by a seemingly never-ending drought but also from harassment by the townsfolk who still accuse him of murdering his high school girlfriend Ellie (BeBe Bettencourt) several decades earlier.Murder mysteries set in small towns are practically their own individual genre in both print and screen-related media. This is due to the fact that people in such a tight-knit community where everybody knows your name are bound to be keeping some secrets so as not to upset the harmony they have all created. Usually stories like these take place in locations such as landlocked US states, green English villages, or Scandinavian seaside towns lit by the midnight sun. Here in ""The Dry"", however, the setting is a harsh, drought-stricken Australian farming settlement, and this works well in the film's favour.Living near a rural area in Australia myself, I can understand how frustrating it is for small communities not receiving rain for extended periods of time, especially when there seems to be no relief in sight. Having this film's story take place in amongst this bleak atmosphere is a great way to show off the feelings of sadness and resentment its citizens are experiencing during these trying times. From the moment he arrives, Aaron feels he is not welcome here, receiving a great deal of hostility from some of the people he passes in the streets. Of course, as the film goes on, it is clear that not everyone hates him, with a select few offering their assistance whenever he may need it, which leads us to believe that there's more to his past than what we initially know. Although, this doesn't become evident until about one third of the way through, so it is quite disheartening to watch Aaron constantly put up with so much verbal abuse from others when all he is trying to do is offer some help.This film is also very well shot thanks to director Robert Connolly's choices in cinematography. The wide Australian landscape stretches as far as the eye can see with nothing but burnt yellow fields and parched cracked roads due to a lack of rain. Scenery like this helps establish the heated attitudes of Kiewarra's residents treating one of their former inhabitants with such disdain. In addition to this, I also liked scenes that took place during Aaron's flashbacks to his childhood, where he would be hanging out with his friends by a river surrounded by rocks. These are later juxtaposed with the modern day river being completely dried up because of the drought, symbolising that Aaron's positive memories of this place have succumbed to the harsh passages of time. While Connolly succeeds in conveying this to the audience, I feel where he fall short is in the film's pacing. The first act does tend to drag as he tries to show the importance of Aaron's return to his hometown. This is thankfully rectified later on, but it doesn't draw you into the story right away like how a mystery should.It's nice to see Eric Bana return to his Australian roots to act in a movie like this. I've always considered him to be an underappreciated actor, at least by international standards, capable of playing both comedic and dramatic roles effectively. Here, Bana portrays Aaron as a quiet, reserved man still haunted by events that took place over twenty years prior, and even in the delivery in his lines you can tell he is still hurt over what happened. I definitely felt sorry for him as the film progressed, which is one of the main reasons I stayed invested in the plot. As for the rest of the cast, I suppose Genevieve O'Reilly stood out the most to me as Gretchen, Aaron's only surviving childhood friend who is also one of the few people in Kiewarra who still trusts him. I don't really have much else to say about anyone else except that I think they all did a nice enough job playing off Bana. All of the townsfolk are made to look like they are hiding something and in a crime mystery this is important, especially during this film's final moments.In conclusion, thanks to the solid performance of its main star and an intriguing enough premise to hold my attention, I consider ""The Dry"" to be a fine example of recent Australian cinema and indeed crime mysteries in general. The unusual setting of somewhere hot as opposed to the gloomy cold locations of other small town murder stories works well, possibly leaving the door open for other works in this style. It certainly makes for an interesting shake-up to that formula we've come to associate with Europe and the Americas and I'm all for this kind of change.I rate it 8/10.",The Dry

The pub was authentic (down to the clientele being in their fluoro PPE) but the premise that an FBI agent, even an ex-local, can influence a murder investigation (where were the detectives from the nearest larger town???) was a bit of a stretch.

62,waltermwilliams,Confronting Aussie Murder Mystery,8,21 December 2020,"There's something very confronting about just how dry parts of Victoria are as seen graphically in the movie adaptation of Jane Harpers novel, ""The Dry"".
Once flowing rivers are now dry barren creek beds.
Lush farming paddocks are reduced to dust bowls where the only thing that grows now is whirly winds.
It's like a moon scape, but it's real and at the heart of this new Aussie movie starring Eric Bana.
The former stand up comedian delivers a full frontal dramatic performance along with Genevieve O'Reilly, Bruce Spence, Matt Nable, Miranda Tapsell, Jon Polson plus all the young actors who support them admirably in the flashbacks.
Only one thing troubles me about this crime, drama, murder mystery is why no one did their math.
The filming location is Horsham and its set 20 years since the unsolved death of a local 17 year old girl.
However all its stars playing older versions of themselves are in their 40's or 50's and none look 37 years young.
Otherwise this is a world class movie about a now Australian Federal Police officer returning to his drought-stricken hometown to say goodbye to his lifelong mate at a funeral of him, his wife and son.
Is it a murder-suicide brought on by the years long Dry spell or something far more sinister?
You'll know the answer after nearly two hours of watching this mystery unravel on the Big Screen...no stone is left unturned.
Thank goodness because I despise open endings with lots of conjecture.
""The Dry"" has shades of Picnic at Hanging Rock and will keep you guessing.

No ""pay off"" whatsoever; I was shocked to read the stellar reviews.A quick note to my Australian 9/10 reviewers: When you rate something ridiculously high simply because it comes from your country means others will read that and expect a phenomenal film! Great Australian films such as Rover or Animal Kingdom have excellent reviews from fellow Aussies however the film backs up the reviews.Now guess what happens the next time I see an extremely well-rated Australian film? I will most likely skip it simply because of the inherent bias I have encountered from reviews such as yours on The Dry!I adore Australia, it's people, and film & tv series. I hate see all the great work watered down just so because some Australians put out a half-baked film and encourage their friends/families/crew to pump up the reviews. These guys are dislocating their shoulders patting themselves on the back & congratulating each other but it's fake.With regards to this film:+ The lead's acting was... problematic. His female friend/romantic interest should return to those acting classes again too!+ Why did the principal/teacher character have such a ridiculous wig? Seriously, why did they make him wear that thing? It must have been very hot!+ Did the actress who randomly sang for a few minutes pay the filmmakers to have this kick start her singing career? Did that work for her? If not, who is she related to with regards to production?+ Who genuinely wrote this script and thought ""yeah, this will work out great!""? Are you hiring?+ How did the lead actor hurt only his lil' ears and hand whilst putting out a giant village-threatening fire? Will there be a superhero movie tie-in?+ Who were the detectives that missed the BRAND-NEW GIANT BACKPACK 20 years before?+ Why did the married guys in this film pick those *particular* brides?Tl;dr - If you rate your show obscenely high (because it's from your country) and it's not good people will begin discounting your country's well-rated films!

Eric Bana, an amazing talent, puts in a nicely understated performance.
The rest of the cast are great.
As another reviewer said, there is a subtle homage to Picnic at Hanging Rock in this film and it has that same haunting quality.
The harsh, dry landscape is also one of the stars of this film.

Despite that, it's a solid mystery of two murders both surrounded by the lies and secrets of a small town. The mystery holds well until the end so it's not completely obviously in the first 10 minutes, I hate movies that do the latter. Cast is mostly lesser known with Bana as the only ""big"" name, though some may recognise Bruce Spence. I'm glad I watched it. Both murders are solved by Falk (Eric Bana). So there is closure.Watch it if you liked Kenneth Branagh's Wallander series.",The Dry
105,peterm1,"A bit like the ""Curate's egg.""",6,10 May 2021,"The Curate's egg reference is a reference to an old joke in ""Punch"" magazine in which a Church of England Bishop, having breakfast with a very junior member of the church, a Curate, says ""I am afraid that your breakfast egg is bad"". The humble Curate replies, ""Oh no my Lord, parts of it are excellent"".That is a bit like this movie.I thought the settings and the filming were excellent as were the actors - I could not really find any fault with any of them. Neither would I take issue with the fact that the story is really, for the most part very slow paced - I am a fan of slow paced movies, after all in real life most things do run at a slow pace and if it works, I think this somehow can elevate the story above the normal fast paced, action packed ""chewing gum for the eyes"" type of film that seem to be the every day offerings of film makers. A crime drama that is slowing evolving can engage the viewer but must find ways of doing so throughout that do not detract from the story by introducing obvious irrelevancies or contrivances. Somehow this movie did not quite manage that.There were other things in the story that also lacked something and perhaps this is because the movie was not strongly character driven - which could have been the glue which held it together. It is hard to feel strongly for Eric Bana's character for example - we know little about him except that he was implicated in the death of a teen friend 20 years before and now he is single and solitary. Perhaps more could have been made of how the first thing led to the other and his present state of mind. Much the same could be said for other characters who mostly flit through the movie without much depth or background to their character. Although it is not a bad technique, the constant flashbacks also demanded close concentration throughout the movie and even with concentration it was sometimes hard to work out what was going on and who was who.Who were the characters who were so hostile to him and exactly why - OK we know in general terms why but exactly why were these people so aggressive? This was worked out as the movie evolved but they entered the movie with little introduction, making it less cogent and harder to follow till eventually it became apparent later. And why were they so openly hostile after 20 years - that is not exactly true to life. Aussies tend not to be so ""in your face"" hostile, and more commonly hold simmering grudges (if any) and tend not to confront people directly. I found this and other things to be somewhat too artificial - an obvious ploy to inject drama where there was none otherwise. Neither did I like the grand finale action scene which played out a bit dumb and not very believable. Though the absolute ending (trying not to give anything away here) was well done and emotionally affecting.On a more positive side I thought the film was reasonably reminiscent of the first season of the ""Mystery Road"" miniseries on TV. Which is a good thing - that drama held my interest throughout the season and a strong engagement with the characters. (Though there was less engagement with characters in this movie). Another comparison can be made with the ""Rain Shadow"" miniseries of a few years ago. It also succeeded a little better than this movie in my view. Both were strongly character driven. So, all in all - the Curate's egg!",The Dry
106,umchinagirard,Sons still dominate family farming inheritance,10,31 December 2020,"This movie resonates and rings true, individuals, families and communities will find it healing. Not because of validating the drought. But because it validates, the Cruel Fractured legacy of patriarchal or greed of farming families practices. Owning land is power. There's a lot of heritage and history involved, anything in relation to that property is loaded with emotional meanings. In juxtaposition to connection and healthy farming family relationships, the family farm or owning the farm becomes a ruthless goal for power. This is The Game of Thrones in rural Australia. The images of rural vistas, the ""ownership"" of land was part of what made this a fraught, a subject seldom discussed or most often ignored when it came to farmers daughters.
The farming culture has a mythological focus on men's attachment to the land and by assumption, that women girls can't be attached to the land. For girls in rural towns everywhere, this is a lesson in how limited, oppressed, precarious and dangerous your role is.",The Dry

118,LisaLR1,"Eric Bana Captivates in Tense Aussie Crime Drama, ""The Dry""",8,28 May 2021,"Eric Bana (Aaron Falk) Captivates in Tense Aussie Crime Drama, ""The Dry,"" co-written and directed by Robert Connolly (""The Slap,"" ""Balibo,"" ""The Bank""), based on the novel by Jane Harper. Bana plays a policeman in Melbourne, Australia who goes back to his rural hometown of Kiewarra, in the midst of a long, lingering drought, to attend the funeral of childhood friend, Luke, whose wife and son were brutally murdered. Falk stays and works with the Town Sergeant to try and solve the case of the three deaths. Falk also learns to come to terms with his own role in the unsolved death of a girl from the town that he befriended when he was a teenager, reopening old wounds. The movie offers twists-and-turns, suspense and a few suspects, with an ending that's a complete surprise, especially for those who haven't read the novel.",The Dry
119,Donnie_Quixotic,Despairingly Dry Drama,3,23 April 2021,"Tip of the hat to Keir O'Donnell for being the only actor to rise above what was a completely uninspired, and adolescent script. Unfortunately for Bana, he wasn't able to achieve the same feat, and his character, Aaron Falk, will go down in cinematic history as one of the most boring and banal detectives - no, make that boring and banal characters - ever.Bana, who I love for his performance in ""Chopper,"" produces his most emotive moment in this film when the water pressure fails in the shower. (I know it was supposed to represent his anger and frustration at his investigation and predicament, but some of that emotion could have been used in character interactions.)Most of the other actors - just like Bana - always look like they're acting - there's just no verisimilitude in the film whatsoever. The amount of time wasted in eye-rolling dialogue scenes by greetings like ""G'day mate, how are you?"" etc., etc. Or repetitive dinner scenes in which the same rhetorical, insipid social mores are repeated and we learn nothing interesting about the characters... well, with the exception that we're told O'Donnell's local policeman character hasn't slept since the murders, which does offer some insight into how he's been affected by the events of the film.I thought the script doctrine for scenes was, cut to the scene late (i.e., partway through a conversation or piece of action), and leave early (i.e., when the audience has the necessary plot and character information). In ""The Dry"" they seem to say, screw the scene doctrine, we'll arrive unfashionably early and leave annoyingly late. Of course you can ignore these cinematic rules if you fill the extra scene-time with snappy, punchy, witticisms and action... ""The Dry"" eschews this convention of cinema, too, instead offering up nothing but trite social colloquialisms, inevitably punctuated by some investigative questions delivered in a forced-acting emotional style (which comes across as unemotional).The portentous music in the film sets the scene for a far more moody thriller, but neither the lighting nor the cinematography - not to mention the script - deliver on that thematic quality. The shadows needed to be darker to contrast with the dry, sun-drenched environment. There needed to be more intense closeups when conveying emotional scenes (not that the script could provide the adequate dialogue to do this, but the camera hanging back all the time reduced the emotional impact even more - which, to me, is a total filmic error for this type of emotional drama/thriller. It's not like there was any beautiful production design with amazingly detailed sets that they just had to capture within the frame and therefore keep the camera further back). Bana should have had sweat dripping from his brow and on the armpits of his shirt, and not so neatly coiffed and pressed - just something to symbolise his angst at this horrific family murder and the demons of his past (which we boringly flash back to time and time again). I understand he's supposed to be a cleanskin city-slicker to contrast with the sweaty rural rabble, but some kind of a character arc could have been achieved - at least visually. Anyway, he basically leaves as he came in, unchanged, albeit with the investigations of the both the past and present resolved.Anyway, in keeping with ""The Dry's"" on-the-nose sensibilities, it can be summed up in on-the-nose fashion: ""The Dry"" is drought-ridden of any genuine plot thrills; scorched of any interesting characters; and burnt of any intellectual ideas. Conversely it's flooded with empty and insipid dialogue; achieves a burst dam of overacting combined with underperformance; and presents a torrent of emotionally inefficient camerawork, combined with a tidal wave of ineffective lighting. It's soap opera-ish, and just doesn't have the necessary filmic rhythm (peaks, troughs, escalating stakes, high tension, relief of tension, witty dialogue, character growth/contraction) to sustain its running time.",The Dry

Our local movie critics are also incapable of judging local films without bias. They too, get overexcited and rave on about a film like ""The Dry"". This is not a boring film, or am awful experience, however, it's really not that great. Of course, we all get sentimental when we see the Australian landscape photographed in a movie, it's close to our hearts and we get touched by it. This film has all the ingredients to potentially have been a great film, but that opportunity was missed. The story has many holes, the constant flashbacks get confusing, the performances are not that great, Eric Bana has no chemistry with anyone on the screen, the soundtrack is nonstop and aimless, and annoying. The dialogue is also poorly done. Very basic screenwriting, nothing sophisticated, very much on-the-nose. I understand the desire to portray the simplicity of the characters being a country/rural setting, however, films like Coen Brothers' ""Fargo"" achieve this without compromising the integrity of the dialogue.

just nowPosturing, empty, immature, this film pretends to be something when it's never more than an extended episode of any faceless, Australian crime series. It's not the kind of film which could handle themes as you would expect of a movie as opposed to yet another a series episode, nor could present some kind of human interest. It all felt very fake and shallow.I think it's supposed to have atmosphere. Actually that amounts to just a lot of aerial drone scenes of not much, and for example someone driving to eerie music, in between really plodding formulaic development of the crime plot.I had guessed who the killer was for much of the film though hadn't worked out the whys exactly, as everything was connected to an historical murder.The end was a major anticlimax, and would still have been whether or not you had any idea who the killer was. The reasons behind the murders had not been developed or suggested until close to the very end, so it's a case of not really giving a damn.On the whole, the impression is that the actors thought they were something more than their written characters and skills allow. Also the film tries to seem more than the sum of its parts, but unsuccessfully. The screenplay is unimpressive. Even when there is occasional good acting, like from a potential love interest later in the film, I wondered by that stage why she was bothering. A real character suddenly? That doesn't really fit in.Maybe the book was a whole lot better but dry is an understatement for this dull film.It's a little scammy also by leading you along through it, not exactly with suspense but because you may suppose there's something to learn. The best way would be to give up but it seems that the film knows that and is keeping you hanging on cynically.I found that it's really difficult to care for any of the characters at all, or the place or whodunnit in the end. I just wished I hadn't been drawn to watch the worid of that film by adverts for it.",The Dry

The land needs the fire, not to harm people to regenerate. The land needs its native animals not hicks with guns.It's a crying shame this movie could absolutely be a true story. The actors did such a wonderful job there were times I had to remind myself it wasn't.Would have loved to have seen a closing scene with the rapist father being locked up for good, the birth of the cops baby and maybe a happier ending for the bubs.

Luke's wife and son have been killed and it is assumed that Luke is the culprit, but Luke's parents ask Aaron (who is now a police officer in Melbourne) to do some unofficial investigating. Aaron teams up with the young local policeman to come with some unexpected solutions. The acting of Eric Bana and others make this an intriguing film.

162,shampyon,"A good murder mystery, and a shining example of Australian storytelling",9,22 January 2021,"On top of being a damn good murder mystery, it was wonderful to see an Australian movie that doesn't try to play down the specificity of life in this country. Many Australian films could very easily be set in any other country - designed to be universally appealing, with a thin layer of ocker seasoning. But this story, the range of characters in it, their personalities and quirks, are very specifically of this time and place.Matt Nable continues to be a pleasant surprise for those of us first introduced to him as a football player. He brings a level of realism to his performance that is completely familiar; I could almost believe the filmmakers had been spying on people I grew up alongside. He made such interesting character choices. Injecting vulnerability where a lesser actor may have chosen hardness. Portraying that vulnerability with a sincerity that in another's hands may have been laughable, but in his became a full realised multi-dimensional human being.Indeed, all of the main characters feel multidimensional. Not a one is a simple one-note character. All have flaws and contradictions that just feel real.In other words, this feels like the world I've lived in. Given the saturation of American media in our cinemas and on our small screens, occasionally punctuated by a UK comedy or Nordic crime drama, that is a very rare and very welcome feeling indeed.",The Dry

I had read the book which did a great job painting a distressed town in the grip of a devastating drought. In the book one could feel the heat and hear the desiccated undergrowth crackle. Emotional conflicts were also handled nicely. The writing and the way the book paints the landscape and the people masks the weakness in the plot and the poorly developed unveiling of the perpetrator
Sadly the movie fails to show any emotional depth in any characters. The town is greener and far less bleak than shown in the book.
To make matters worse the way the crime is solved is even more abbreviated than in the book.

The pacing was perfect in my opinion, an excellent match of the feel of a dry spell and allowed time to draw out a few of the important characters. The ending of neither mystery was a big surprise, but I thought they were handled well, especially the one from the past.

Exceptional soundtrack, the music really works to build an intensity - the only lull in the pacing of the film comes with the final denouement when plot has to take precedence over character and musical themes.

This great piece of murder mystery set in the Australian countryside is a very fitting story to see on a hot summer day inside a chilled cinema - you will not regret it.
Both the cast and Robert Connelly as the director excelled in presenting the story that needed a little bit to ""get into"" as the timeline of the old mystery is somewhat unclear at the start. However, once the pieces start falling together and the plot twists make it take a few turns you will get mesmerised by the scenery and the characters.
The movie is both emotional and graphic towards the end as the secrets are revealed. By that time you might be well immersed in the the movie and might end up leaving a bit shaken up by the injustice of it all for the main character who is walking away from the scene of the original murder - with a deep feeling of loss but also with the answers he searched for all his life.",The Dry

214,matchocassidy,"Amazed at another unique Aussie movie, this may will become a classic they look back on (Minor Spoilers, nothing really said,)",9,1 January 2021,"You might say that it's predictable.
But this film doesn't intend to be a mystery film, just a thriller where you're set on the search for truth in a town where intentions are hidden through the common biases of misinterpreted justice. Set in a remote somewhat serene small town of Kiewarra (which doesn't actually exist). A bond between townsfolk that gives you country like small town vibes of sharing that same chip on the shoulder when it comes to city folk and communal carrying of the burden of drought.Eric Banners performance gracefully carries the movie through the emotional balance of being a tough cop that has a lot of invested feelings to connected characters throughout the film, displaying holding back emotions through heart wrenching scenes and nostalgic flashbacks in a face that says it all.This film may not be praised in it's time but will age well, when people understand it's purpose of what the film is really trying to say between the plot.The romanticism of highlighting townsfolk within desperate measures is what cued me to know who the killer or what happened to the girl straight away, although most won't pick up on the reveal until the end. It's as if they made it so obvious and then just to play with us, rewrite the killer and make us think for a second we could be wrong. That people become so desperate or greedy, that there's barely any certainty until there's direct evidence, that the process of police work can be misinterpreted or justice can be manipulated, that almost any of us can become lost in hopelessness if we allow ourselves to slip and blame god that the whether is too damn hot and dry.I believe that at the end of the film, when the credits played the rain would have swept the town, even though it wasn't in the movie, a part of me envisions that in the fictional town of Kiewarra where the mysteries of unjustified deaths had burnt into the light of day, that the dry land and it's people would have lifted the curse and became moist with rain and hope once again.",The Dry

I don't recall a bad performance in the film at, which is often the Achilles heel of an Aussie flick. Connolly takes you on a masterful journey of story telling with enough twists to keep you both guessing and engaged.Whilst Eric Bana is perfectly cast in the lead, the entire cast makes the story believable, and as such despite being 2 hours, you want to be there for the entire journey, never once thinking to yourself they need to hurry this along.",The Dry

However i was very happy to have been proven wrong, the acting and the eeriness of the filming is exactly how i imagined it would be, the music creates a great layer of thrill and buildup, also brining your emotions into play. The only reason i haven't rated this a 10/10 is because of the constant jump from scene to scene with no context, like in the book there were more conversations leading to certain scenes playing out but within the film at times it could be confusing. Non the less they did a fantastic job and i highly recommend this movie to any anyone.",The Dry

230,jschirmer-56241,Captivating murder mystery that keeps you guessing till the very end,10,26 January 2021,"Just watched this movie so it's still quite raw in my head, but some of these reviews saying it's not captivating without explanation are just not indicative of this movies true greatness.The Dry will have you guessing till the end, and its use of clever implication and foreshadowing make you wonder how you couldn't pick it from the beginning. I believe it's use of flashbacks don't take away from the mystery of the movie, as many have said in reviews, and if anything provides further tension to what was already built in the present day story. The flashbacks do give the viewers with the small amount of closure that you will have been begging for when they arrive, as this movie does, as any good movie, leave the viewers with that empty feeling of ""hang on, that's it? We aren't going to get the fairy tale ending?"".The score is fantastic, it's chilling, enough to send a chill down your spine. The way that the beautiful soundtrack merges with the visuals of the Barron and drought-ridden Australian outback will leave you with an eerie feeling deep down that just won't let go.The climax of the movie is enough to bring a tear to your eye, and at the very least leave you speechless for quite some time as you think over it.If this movie is still available for watching on the big screen I cannot suggest it more, you will not regret viewing it.",The Dry

I read a number of positive reviews for The Dry, but the reviews simply didn't match the movie. The acting was terrible, the dialogue cliched and the plot twists absurd. (SPOLIER ALERT:) The idea that the teacher, simply murdered three people including a young boy, over pokie gambling debts was just inane and silly. Only matched by the ""finding,"" of the backpack TWENTY YEARS LATER in the nook of the tree, with the diary in pristine readable condition. I am amazed Eric Bana starred in such a dreadful movie.",The Dry
232,davidmurray-01136,Could Have Been A Blockbuster,6,2 February 2021,Firstly I have not read the book. All of the hype that I have heard around this film I expected more than what was delivered. The cinematography and acting was great although I did not get fully immersed in this film. The film did not fully establish the characters and flashback scenes confused me to who was who and what their relationships were. The soundtrack was not existent and so did not build or accentuate the mood in the film. Also the director did not use the camera to emphasise the dry of the area and the effects it has on all aspects of life for example. An opportunity lost for a film that could have been a classic.,The Dry

234,marciabaila-80101,Promising build-up ruined by weak plot twist,4,6 February 2021,"'The Dry' had the stage to tell a really difficult and important story in our society about gendered violence and it baulked and chose a limp red herring murder narrative.For three quarters of the film I was compelled and drawn into the small town environment and the people within it. It was beautiful to see Victorian rivers, gums and dirt roads on the big screen. The settings of the carpet pub corridors, the rusted school fly-wire doors, cane chairs on the porch and yellow crockery behind glass cabinets all felt expressive and lived-in.I felt the parallel narratives were nicely developing a ratcheting moral tension for Aaron; comparing his inability to accept that his friend Luke killed his family and the suggestion that for years he had lied about Luke's murder of their friend Ellie. These suggestions were drawn from the flashback narrative portraying the young Luke as acting callous and insensitive to Ellie (dunking under the water dangerously) and the guilt that Aaron expressed when the past incident was brought up.I felt the funeral in the small town hall was an emotionally charged moment with the people having the difficulty of holding both a cruel murder and the loss of a liked community member, grief and judgment in the same space. At this point, I felt that Luke's mother Barb clearly demonstrated how the idea that there was an alternate killer was acting as a protection from the pain of having to consider Luke's culpability.Murder-suicide family violence is a part of our culture that is very difficult to acknowledge and more common than we accept. The family man is the fulcrum of our domestic imagination and struggles to be outcast as immoral. This has been demonstrated repeatedly by the way these men are portrayed as 'good blokes' in the ensuing media coverage.I felt that as Aaron's fixation on uncovering the investigation was building, and once the red herrings of various town secrets had been revealed as irrelevant, he would reach a moment of catharsis having to face what his friend had done and his complicity in protecting him from consequences of the murder of Ellie. As Luke's father suggests, if there had been accountability earlier, would Karen and Billie have had their lives taken from them. I felt that it would have been an interesting subverting of the righteous law-enforcer being shown to not be uncovering truth but to be losing his grip on what is right; his behavior becoming desperate as he manipulates the investigation and trespasses in Gretchen's house.Instead, the narrative chose to completely extinguish the moral tension and create an insipid twist that places all the moral blame on a side character who was 'just trying to save his family'. This shift places Aaron's character into the easily digestible role of virtuous hero who is able to act assertively and literally 'save the town' from fire. In the neat wrap up, Aaron no longer has to contend with moral ambivalence and Luke's character dissolves into irrelevance.It should be noted that Ellie's father Mal was revealed as being sexually abusive as well as being her murderer. This narrative arc was suggested earlier with some of Ellie's confusion with intimacy. During the film Mal was presented as a gnarled outsider and not given much on an internal narrative to allow space for the meaty moral greyness that I had hoped that Australian films would be interested in depicting.I felt viscerally betrayed by what I thought was a weak decision to avoid sitting with the reality of male violence and how a friend processes their role in contributing to a lack of accountability. Given that the Dry was so beautifully made, I felt it was really disappointing that the depiction of gendered violence in a film which such popular reach was only used as a red herring for a lifeless plot twist. In some ways, by validating the disbelief at the existence of a father killing his wife and child, this film contributes to the very social collusion that it hinted it would rawly lay open with an unflinching gaze.",The Dry

It is a satisfying whodunnit movie with a solid and real plot. Actually there are 2 whodunnit plots, one that happens simultaneously as the movie and the other 20 years ago with the main actor to be the protagonist of both of them! But I won't say any more! You won't see any action or dynamic scenes, but slowly you will be absorbed in the fantastic scenery of rural Australia. The characters may not be developed as deep as the book, but I think this is something that many similar adapted films can encounter. I totally enjoyed the 2 hours of watching it, and I wished, there was a sequel!",The Dry

240,severussnape-91184,Quintessentially Australian,8,13 October 2021,"'The Dry' (2021), is a captivating murder mystery film made by a more than competent cast and crew. Eric Bana's performance perfectly embodies Aaron Falk and is perfectly contrasted with the supporting cast and the dynamic repertoire of characters.What really sets 'The Dry' apart however, is its setting. The feature was filmed entirely within the Australian state of Victoria in both lush and barren landscapes, perfectly encapsulating the imagery provided by Jane Harper in her novel of the same name. Additionally, the fictional town of Kiewarra is perfectly reflective of real Australian rural towns and despite its physical emptiness, feels full of life and secrets. As a Victorian, watching 'The Dry' felt like a much needed revision of typical representation of rural Australia in that no red dirt or deserts are included in the film. The film's dry paddocks and evaporated creeks are a much more accurate representation of Australian landscapes, and their prominence in the film consequently ground the whole story in reality instead of being yet another stereotype.Another thing to note is the music. Peter Raeburn's score perfectly encapsulates the haunting themes of both main storylines and really works in establishing the setting whilst putting viewers on edge. Additionally, Bebe Bettencourt's performance of The Church's 'Under the Milky Way' fits her character perfectly and really works to add to the nostalgia, melancholia and sadness underlying the film's events.The film is also one of the best I've seen in terms of remaining true to the source material. The film doesn't include everything within the 2016 novel - however, every part of the film comes directly from the book.I would normally write a section dedicated to potential flaws that the film has but I cannot think of any. This film to me is a perfect insight into Australian rural farming culture and as a Victorian, I appreciate it immensely .Overall, 'The Dry' is a well produced and perfectly paced mystery film, injected with comedic moments and Australian nostalgia, which perfectly encapsulates farming life in Victoria. The film's two main plotlines are entertaining and its adherence to the source material helps it in its authenticity. This film is a much needed step into Australia during the COVID-19 pandemic and is thoroughly entertaining after multiple viewings. I would highly recommend this to anyone, Australian or not.",The Dry

Cinematography was amazing , it showcased the arid and harsh conditions that engulf remote Australia when it's in full fledged drought. Acting was great, again showing the complexities yet simplicities of the community in a typical remote Australian town. The reason I gave it a six is because the story line was overly predictable and the pace was just a tad too slow. I'm sure the pace was intentional to again reflect what it's like to live in a remote community, no hustle, no bustle, no commute, but for a two cinema experience it somehow took away from the story.",The Dry
252,freekngr8,Taught and terrific Aussie drama,9,17 January 2021,"Gripping drama-mystery which captures the harsh Australian drought and the difficult lives of those who try to live and love in such difficult conditions.
The typically parochial small bush town is captured perfectly without any sentimentality.
Eric Bana is fantastic in the lead role and Genevieve O'Reilly excellent but the younger Ellie played by Bebe Battencourt and younger Aaron played by Joe Klocek steal the show.
The characters are all so complex and grey with hidden motives, psychological dysfunction and layered masks to create wonderful tight and gripping drama.
The filming is beautiful but it's not the environment that is predatory, rather is the characters that move and circle one another that creates the tension and unease.
Would have given it 10/10 but feel it could have been a little tighter in length - 10-15minutes taken off would have been beneficial.",The Dry
