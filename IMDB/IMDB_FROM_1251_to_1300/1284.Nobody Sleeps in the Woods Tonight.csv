0,nogodnomasters,Just like Terminator,5,18 November 2020,"The is a Polish Horror film dubbed in English. It is in part a spoof of the common formula of the slasher genre as explained by one of the campers. A group of teens go camping as therapy to stay away from cell phones and technology. The woods contains two deformed cannibals.We know the formula, sex kills, the ugly guy gets it and the virgin is the final girl always introduced first, but in this case it was 35 minutes into the film.The production had its fun moments like placing a body in a wood chipper and axing someone in half.Guide: F-word, sex, nudity (Wiktoria Gasiewska)",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight
1,kosmasp,"Another day, another slasher",6,5 November 2020,"But not from America this time around, but from Poland, Europe. The thing is though, if you accuse the movie of being cliche and predictable (all valid), you can't judge this differently than all those movies coming from the old US of A! The new ones and the old ones (though I reckon the old ones should be given some leeway, depending if they were first there or just copying).Having said all that, if you are into slasher movies and their tropes ... well you probably will like this. So yes, tropes, cliches and sometimes even bad choices all amount to a ... I would say decent horror movie! Well shot and the tension is there ... even if you know most of the time what's coming ...",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight
2,Sleepin_Dragon,Enjoyable.,7,6 November 2020,"Thanks to Netflix I've gotten to watch several Polish films, admittedly all horrors, and of the ones I've seen, I've enjoyed them all. Nobody Sleeps in the woods (to be lazy, and use the translation,) is really rather good.It's true, there isn't really any new material here, but what is done, is done well. Very much a Polish Wrong Turn, with a bit of Cabin in The Woods mixed in. It takes a bizarre twist, when we learn how things came to be, and there are enough shocking moments.A few times we hear points about how it is for people in Poland, being gay etc. It seems that the writer and producer wanted to make a few points.Clichés apart, rather good. 7/10.",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight
3,Tweekums,Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight,8,19 September 2021,"This Polish slasher film is centred on a group of internet addicted youths who are attending a tech-free camp deep in the woods. Shortly after they arrive they are divided into smaller groups and we observe one group, two girls and three boys led by a woman, as they head off for a three day hike. They find the remains of a stag which suggests a large predator is in the area but continue. After their first night in the wilderness one of the boys is missing... the viewer gets to see that he has been battered and taken by a mutated person. They split it to look for him and things rapidly get worse as more and more of them meet sticky ends.If you are a fan of the slasher genre this film has a lot to commend it. The set-up is what you'd expect; a group of young adults going into woodland with no means of communication and no idea that danger awaits them followed by a series of increasingly gory deaths. There aren't too many surprises but that doesn't matter to much as it managed to ramp up the tension nicely and featured some genuinely scary moments. Of course there were some weak points; we didn't really need to know the backstory of the two killer mutants, this exposition slowed to pace of the film a bit too much at a moment when it should have been building. The cast did a solid job; most obviously Julia Wieniawa who played Zosia. The makers are clearly fans of the genre with clear similarities to films like 'Friday the 13th' and 'The Hills Have Eyes'... some may find this lazy and unoriginal but I rather liked it; certain tropes become cliché because they are effective; and its possible they were thinking about Polish viewers who may be less familiar with such films than those in English speaking countries... even if characters can quote 'The Terminator' in English which suggests some knowledge. Overall I'd certainly recommend it to fans of the genre.These comments are based on watching the film in Polish with English subtitles.",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight
4,paul_haakonsen,A generic and predictable Polish foray into the slasher genre...,4,14 August 2021,"I stumbled upon the 2020 Polish horror movie titled ""Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight"" (aka ""W lesie dzis nie zasnie nikt""), as it was available on Netflix. And of course, with it being a movie that I hadn't already seen and also being a horror movie, of course I sat down to watch it.Well, at least writers Bartosz M. Kowalski, Jan Kwiecinski and Mirella Zaradkiewicz were on to something here, but they sort of resorted to fall into the slump of using tropes already seen and done countless times before.Now, I am not familiar with Polish cinema, so whether or nothing 2020 slasher flick was a milestone in Polish horror cinema, I have no idea. But in comparison to a worldwide slasher genre, then ""Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight"" just wasn't outstanding.Sure, ""Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight"" was watchable, but it was predictable and generic. If you think ""The Hills Have Eyes"" mixed with ""Hatchet"", then you essentially have ""Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight"". And if you have seen the aforementioned two American slasher flicks, then you can actually just skip on ""Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight"", because you will already have seen it. Trust me.There simply wasn't enough of original material to be seen throughout the course of ""Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight"". And certain elements were just blatantly copied from movies such as ""Friday the 13th"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes"", for example.""Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight"" is plagued by having an insanely mundane and forgettable character gallery. You will remember two of the main characters, and trust me, when someone shows up dead, you'll go 'oh yeah, he/she was also in the movie'. Yep, the characters were that forgettable and plain.I will say that the make-up and prosthetics on the two deranged killers was actually good. Nothing memorable or outstanding, but it looked pretty good. And the special effects for the violence and murders was actually also quite good, although not really enough to lift up the movie and put all of its shortcomings behind it.The storyline told in ""Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight"" was straight forward, albeit very, very generic.For a slasher flick, then ""Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight"" didn't manage to make itself outstanding or memorable. So director Bartosz M. Kowalski just didn't delivered where it mattered.My rating of ""Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight"" lands on a very generous four out of ten stars. This is the type of movie you will watch once, then forget about it entirely and never return to watch it a second time.",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight
5,BandSAboutMovies,A good modern slasher!,5,28 October 2021,"Never go home again and never go to an abandoned tropical island with a coke-using film crew and never swim in the ocean and never go to camp. This camp has a reason, I guess, as the kids are addicted to the internet and must go phone free, which is a great way to future proof this slasher, as so many times you just wonder, ""Why not just use your phone?""So while there's Iza, the character that knows the rules of horror movies, no one else listens and has sex in the woods, as they always do, and then a set of massive twin meteorite mutated monsters start killing people, as these things happen, and then everyone is really in for it.The film has some beautiful locations while planting its soul firmly in the 80s slasher world, although the science fiction backstory for the killers is really fun, as is the makeup.Since this got added to Netflix - and did quite well - its been confirmed that a sequel is coming, reuniting director Bartosz M. Kowalski and most of the crew the film's lone survivor.Someone said to me the other day, ""What did you expect, it's a slasher,"" and then I was like, ""You realize that's like slapping me and not expecting me to fight, right?"" And that was about a bad slasher. This is a decent one.",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight
6,Calicodreamin,Just kind of ends,5,28 October 2020,"Overall not too bad, good effects and horror makeup, acting was decent. Storyline though was a bit weird and the end came rather suddenly.",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight
7,Edvis-1997,3,3,25 December 2020,"Text: That was one of the worst movies of 2020 so far. In the beginning blood stains on the wall looked so fake,it seemed to be like 2000-2005 CGI but it's nowhere good for 2020, like come on. Then it started with casual,bland camp with kids who go to forest. Nothing new, everything we saw before. Why the girl(whose age we don't know,I hope she's 18) acting like that, is a mistery. The next aspect was the death of teacher,campus woman, I don't know how to call her. Her head moulage was so bad. It looked like a mannequin from clothes shop. There are so many mistakes and cliques, such as, when they run for help and found that cabin, the man told it would take at least 2 day walk to the nearest camp but in fact i took only 1 day whole trip from the camp to forest, how that even makes sense. Another episode when the girl(who survived) and a boy(who liked gaming) get in the basement. Girl took a phone and she needed to unlock the phone to call police. You don't need to unlock a phone to call emergency, how directors didn't know this simple thing. Why those ""creepy monsters"" didn't kill girl and left her in the basement when they're killing everyone without mercy. It's just surprises me how Polish directors can create masterpieces in 2020, such as ""The Hater"", and somehow come up with this. It's just sad, I don't recommend to watch it.",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight
8,ops-52535,amazing gore ...,7,1 November 2020,"For them who like that , but there are stories within the story that strains out in nothingness, like where or what happened to the rest of the camp kids filling up a bus in the start of the film...well its a typical rural polish horror drama with archtypes of the polish wood farmer and friends, that lives in close connection to the wilderness, and unfortunate hits from an abroadcoming asteroid, and what frights may come out of addiction to digital media etc.the plot could have been a gold mine of opportunities, you just get small portions of gutsy action here and there, the acting are quite good, and as always in horror slasher movies sticks to the 6 golden rules-what they are youll learn if watching..productionwise its a colourenhanced and pretty strong filmproduct, that may entertain many, but keep it away from the minors, because the swordblades have two sides, and it usually cuts things apart, so glory gory halleluwah to you all with a recommend from his jubilleing review nr 1000 by the grumpy old man",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight

11,jadavix,The first Polish slasher is also one of the best,7,14 January 2021,"The ""first Polish slasher movie"" is definitely better than most of the others. I can't believe how much better shot this movie was than most slashers, how much better the special effects, make-up and costumes are. Even the acting is better, crafting a few decent characters, and a great final girl.The movie also has some genuinely suspenseful moments. How many slashers have that? You can watch a hundred without feeling your pulse rise. This one did it to me a few times.The only real problem is structural. The movie lagged in places, and occasionally I found myself losing interest, and sometimes I had to skip back to see something I had missed. Now I believe this may have been intentional, however: the movie lulls you into a false sense of complacency so that it may shock you.I say check it out. The rating on IMDB, 4.8 at last count, is ridiculously low.",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight
12,kevin_robbins,I do recommend giving it a viewing but with limited expectations,5,13 May 2021,"Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight (2020) was released on Netflix on October 28, 2020 and tells the story of a group of technology dependent children who are forced to go to a camp to get them away from their technology. They go on a hiking trip without any technology and run into some locals that wouldn't mind having some hikers as a snack. This movie is directed by Bartosz M. Kowalski (Playground and A Dream in the Making) and stars Julia Wieniawa-Narkiewicz (The Hater), Wiktoria Gasiewska (Katyn) and Stanislaw Cywka (Strawberry Days). The premise, characters and kill scenes are pretty good. I did enjoy the villains for the most part; however, for the characters to be set up as smart and fairly hip to what they're walking into, they do a lot of stupid sequences to set up the kill scenes (in classic slasher fashion). Some of the storyline seemed a bit forced and predictable and there isn't much new here other than some cool villains in terms of their appearance. I do recommend giving it a viewing but with limited expectations going in. Overall, this is another one I'd give a 5-5.5/10.",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight
13,joiningjt,Extremely fun slasher film ignore the hater!! Comedy as well!!,8,13 November 2020,It's just your basic slasher movie but the villians are fun and unique and there's plenty of decent kill scenes so why all the hate?? People are just to critical anymore it's not suppose to be a great movie it's a homage to 1980s slasher films if you want a fun comedy horror this is for you. Excellent cast and great villians and throw in some great cinematography from the forests of poland.,Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight
14,Pairic,No Teddy Bears Picnic,7,30 October 2020,"Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight : Polish horror film.A Bootcamp for teens addicted to social media, gaming, no phones, tablets, laptops are allowed. A priest even exorcises the devices. The camp is in the midst of a forest and the teens are split into teams. A group of five led by a counselor head into the woods to go camping. Even in daylight the trees look sinister. Nearby a woman keeps her ogre-like son in the basement, feeding him with deer carcasses, she slips and is killed by the monster who escapes. The creature sets about killing the teens and naturally they split up. A boy in his sleeping bag is swung against a tree trunk, another teen is impaled through the head with a tree branch. Other forest dwellers are slain, including being woodchipped alive. Some pretty gruesome and violent scenes throughout the film with a few jump scares. The monster is well imagined and has an interesting origin story. Some interesting and odd characters pop up but the story isn't particularly original. It is helped though by a vein of dark humour which permeates even the most horrific sequences. !02 minutes running time. it would have worked better at 90 minutes. Directed and Co-written by Bartosz M. Kowalski. On Netflix. 7/10.",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight
15,TdSmth5,A slow slasher,6,2 November 2021,"A whole bunch of kids are sent to tech-free camp to get back in touch with nature and so on. There's an intro scene of something or someone out there in the woods killing people. Five of the kids go hiking with their leader--there's the jock, the slutty girl, the closeted gay guy, the fat horror movie buff, and the silent final girl. After the jock and slutty girl have sex, the killing begins. We meet the two very obese killers who are covered in boils and learn how they came to be this way. After the first killing, the group splits much to the protest of fat guy who knows that's a horror movie cliche that has dire consequences. And it does of course. For some reason no one thinks of going back to camp. Instead they are out there putting themselves in the path of our killers, sometimes confronting them. And of course there will be a final confrontation.This movie is technically very well made. For better or worse, it avoids the the typical 2 scenario mode of most horror movies: peace and partying; and crisis, madness, and running. Overall the movie is pretty flat throughout, no matter what is going on people behave the same, and the movie's tone remains the same. While they tried to give every character a bit of a background, it really hinders the pace of the movie. Things never really pick up. The characters too are not particularly engaging. Slutty girl is the most interesting, but you can imagine her fate. For a horror movie, its very ambivalent about gore. Sometimes it's very gory, at other times the violence happens off-camera, which I always find puzzling and infuriating in horror movies.Overall, I appreciate the effort and the spirit of this movie, a pretty straightforward ""nice"" slasher without politics and whatever other agenda Hollywood is trying to push. It could have been trimmed a bit time-wise and to allow it to flow better. But it's worth a watch, there aren't a whole lot of recent movies like these out there.",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight
16,s3276169,A middling Polish retread of horror cult classics......,5,13 November 2020,"""Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight"" draws inspiration from horror cult classics but fails to offer up anything even a little new or terribly creative.That's not to say this is a bad little Polish horror film. No. Its a just an ""unoriginal"" one. Echoes of ""Friday 13th"", ""Halloween"", ""Deliverance"", ""Wrong Turn"", and other's in a similar vein, are everywhere to be seen. Indeed, it even admits as much, so its not taking itself too seriously.Acting and pacing are on target. The setting works too. Where more attention was needed, was in the creative fright department. The build up of existential threat and menace, is pretty nominal and the inevitable deaths, when they occur, feel pedestrian. This film is more gory than anything else. A fact which, on its own, soon gets a little predictable and at times, tiresome.So yes, this film does have just enough to be passable as a functioning horror. That said, I felt it could have done better, has it taken a little more time to research, what made some of its counterparts, cult classics.5/10.",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight

18,Kamurai25,"""Wicked Woods of Poland""",7,6 November 2020,"Mostly good watch, could watch again, and can recommend, especially for a Bad Movie Night.Another movie from the land of bad dubs, and it doesn't look like a 2020 movie, but it is Polish (?) so the production value is forgivable. I'm honestly unfamiliar with what the standards are for European studios, so this is comparative other movies I've seen from American studios.While I think the cast did a great job, and the story is basically solid. Surprisingly the villains are the odd part in this one. Usually the villains make the movie, especially in horror, but they sort of phoned in the origin story for this one.They could have just left out the space rock and it would have been fine. The look of the villains is more gross than scary, and they don't play up traditional horror setups to raise anxiety in the audience.Despite the failures and lack of personalities in the villains, the cast picks up some of the slack, with Julia Wieniawa-Narkiewicz carrying most of the movie.",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight
19,arungeorge13,A generic slasher film set in Poland! [+42%],4,26 December 2020,"Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight is a Polish slasher film that's crafted the Hollywood guidebook way. It even borrows a few gruesome kills from Friday the 13th and Wrong Turn series. If someone randomly tells you that Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight is simply the Polish version of either of those films, I'd say they're not wrong. The soundtrack and the lush Polish locales are probably the only intriguing aspects. The plot is filled with clichés and the protagonists are modelled as textbook-slasher-templates. The cannibal killers look like a nastier version of Victor Crowley from Hatchet. Their backstory was also poorly done. The film just doesn't have enough to be deemed memorable overall.",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight

Great achievement.

25,acedj,Good low budget horror,7,2 December 2020,"I found this on Netflix and since it has been a while since I last saw a decent horror, I decided to give it a go. The story is centralized on five teens and their counselor at a camp where parents send their tech addicted kids for a forced detox. On the first night of them camping in the woods away from the larger group they are besieged by a pair of unnaturally large and deformed men that are driven by the need to kill.This is described as a slasher film, but it is more along the lines of Wrong Turn or The Hills Have Eyes.So the positives; First the gore factor is pretty high for a newer movie and the effects are all definitely practical. This being the first Polish produced film I have ever seen, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the acting. Over all the effects are good, though there were some issues with a severed head and the prosthetics that the killers wear.The negatives; The movie is like every other horror that has come before, the groups is slowly killed until there is but one lone survivor, and you can tell who that will be pretty much from the beginning. The only other negative I could see was the afore mentioned issues with the effects, up and until the ending. There is a scene at the end after you think the movie is done. I would say that you should skip watching that scene as it detracts from the rest of the movieAll in all this was an enjoyable entry into the horror franchise.",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight

Unnecessary sexual scenes.

His story is a rehash of many films already seen: there is an extraterrestrial origin for the deformation and immortality of the villains, there is a bit of tragedy with his mother who was finally eaten by them, there is a camp near a lake where young people addicted to internet are sent to unplug. Nothing that happens is plausible and yet we accept the premise to give meaning to that hour and a half of our lives that we will throw away with this film. We ardently wish the death of all of them and here we find a problem: Villains have no charisma and neither do young people. It is impossible for us to identify with someone and it is the worst that can happen. The deaths are unimaginative and the only thing that redeems this film is photography. It's a mediocre movie.

32,tfminfl,Friday the 13th meets Texas Chainsaw meets X-Files...,10,22 November 2020,"476. Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight. Well, I loved it! I mean the title is a total lie, everyone sleeps the night this takes place, well, except for two, but we will get back to them later. The main premise is this, a bunch of tech addicted teenagers are sent off to a camp called Adrenaline to detox. We follow a smaller group comprised of: Hot girl, hot guy, gay guy, fat nerd video game guy, the girl that doesn't quite fit in with the rest and in the lead an outdoorsy looking counselor, and off they go for a several days long journey into the woods, tech free. As nighttime falls and they start to set up their tents and stuff things seem to be going rather well... until... light spoilers ahead... Hot guy can't sleep, so he heads down to the lake to, oh no, to use his forbidden cell phone he snuck in, and even worse... a marijuana cigarette!! Suddenly out of the darkness he's startled by Hot girl, she partakes in the marijuana cigarette as well, and through some casual flirting she discovers Hot guy is a virgin! So, she quickly remedies that and heads back off to her tent. Hot guy now with a smile on his face settles down in his sleeping bag, when he's startled once again, only this time it's a local man, a large grotesque local man, who, in a very Jason Voorhees-esque move, picks up the sleeping bag and slams it against a tree and drags the body away. The next morning when the gang discovers Hot guy missing and start freaking out, Hot girl confesses to their deed and they go to check things out. That is when, Girl who doesn't quite fit in with the others notices blood on a tree, and thus begins the race out of the woods to stay alive!! First half of the movie has definite Friday the 13th vibes. But this one adds a little something extra to the backstory of the killer, which I enjoyed as an interesting little twist to a familiar tale. The soundtrack and the cinematography in this one is really great. The Girl who doesn't quite fit in with the others, Zosia, was great. Earlier on, Fat Nerd guy, Jurek, compares her to Sarah Connor at one point and as the movie goes on the comparisons keep growing. Jurek also seems to be a fan of the horror movie genre, much like Randy from Scream, he seems to aware of the rules they are breaking if they were in a horror movie. So if you put Friday the 13th, Texas Chainsaw Massacre and a bit of X-Files: 'Home' into a blender, you'd get something like this. A super fun gory slasher flick!!

34,richardwworkman,A decent horror flick.,4,17 November 2020,"On one level this is a bog standard ""kids get murdered in the woods by monster"", slasher movie and it could have been a dreadful pastiche but there are elements to this film that saved it from being a complete clichéd catastrophe.The back story bit adds a folktale element to the story which is told well but on the whole the lack of mystery means it falls somewhere between a conventional slasher flick and a zombie horror.It's a decent enough film but in my opinion lets itself down by revealing itself too quickly. I couldn't help thinking that more could of been made of the woods itself and the plot develops too quickly. The whole feeling from the film was a bit too matter of fact which detracts from the horror.On the whole it's worth watching.

It's like a cross between Dead End, The loved ones and The blob. I watched it with subtitles as I hate dubbing",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight

42,jangu,"Not bad, but not really good either",6,29 October 2020,"Do you wish for a horror movie that's not a silly spoof, but instead a mix of ""The Blob"", ""The Texas chainsaw massacre"", ""Wrong turn"" and ""Scream"" (the meta-references)? Longing for a frights in a setting (summer camp) that is copied from ""Friday the 13th""?
Look no further than to this Polish slasher-movie! It has taken all these elements and baked them together. So we get all the stereotypes as well among the potential victims, however this time a few of them actually have interesting character-traits so you feel for them and want them to survive.
The story is filled with gaping holes (what's wrong with that priest and what is that liquid oozing out of the meteor!?), but involving anyway and tries also to blend in a bit of criticism against certain things in the current situation in Poland. These jabs are maybe a bit clumsy at times, but seem sincere. And having evil twins as monsters is probably pointing a finger towards the political twins Lech and Jaroslaw Kaczynski!
Even though that the movie at times is a bit slow-moving, I was actually hooked from beginning to end. The gore-effects, when they come, are good and will satisfy gore-hounds. The acting is okay, but make sure not to watch the english-dubbed version, the voices are terrible and make the actors seem worse than they are!
All in all, it's a decent slasher that pays hommage to many other (and many times better) movies. It's not ground-breaking in any way, but it will entertain while it lasts.",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight

Very cliché. Group of teens in a wood with gruesome killers.Predictable. You know exactly what's coming up, what will happen and it will attempt to have a twist at the end.While it hovers close to the realms of dreadful, its doesn't go into Them. Despite the cliché and predictable outcomes, I watched it to the end.Horror standards are all in this movie, including: The pretty girl, the 'fat kid', attempts at recognising the 'already done genre', ""don't split up, people always die when they split up"", a cabin in the wood and the classic 'policeman is killed'.The film feels like a Polish attempt at trying to make a horror and wrongly using the American format.

At one point, however, the humor noticeably vanished, and it transitioned to something more akin to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, a set of films I think the history of cinema could do without. Then, towards the conclusion of the story, the humor starting bouncing back at various points. In short, the problem here is an inconsistent tone.

The story takes place in a camp in the woods of Poland while trying to rehabilitate technology addicted teens. Simple premise. The acting is good IMO. The standout being Julia Wieniawa as Zosia. A few others on top of being cliché were just downright annoying, but not enough to deter my score. The music cues were a nice touch. The cinematography was splendid tbh. Great shots and angles. The violence was wonderful with awesome kills and genuinely creepy, but dope monster/creature designs that I haven't seen in a few years.

I get the idea where the makers are paying tribute to all the slasher movies of the 80s and I kinda liked the idea but the execution is a big let down. The plot is the same old where you have a group of teenagers getting lost in a forest and you have someone chasing them.There are plenty of violence and gore scenes. Cutting, chopping...all in. Mind you, there is no problem with the bloodfest but adds nothing scary or exciting. The story is a dull affair too where you are stuck with plenty of cliche scenes and cliche acting. The villain or the monster here is cringy and looks really-really stupid.The background music plays a very important role in a horror movie and this is where the makers have gone wrong by adding a music score that is more cringy and less spooky or chilly.If you just need a slasher or bloodfest kinda screen time then go ahead and enjoy it. Just in case you need a movie with some storyline and an engaging plot with some cool twists to spook you out then please stay away from this title.",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight

The main value to this movie comes from its soundtrack. I would usually give a slasher this generic either a 3 or a 4. However, the soundtrack really sticks out and helps bump this slasher up to a 5. At times, there will be music that sounds straight out of a 1950s UFO movie. It appears as a quixotic choice at first, but will make sense as the movie develops. Other than the music, the movie scores points for protagonists I found myself caring about as well as decent kills. However, the killers in this movie are very unmemorable and this criticism applies to the entire plot too. On the whole, there are better slasher in the woods options to watch. Most notably, I would recommend the 1984 season of American Horror Story before watching this movie.Pros: Great soundtrack, decent protagonists, interesting goreCons: uninteresting killers with terrible backstory, plot severely lacks originality, last third of the movie drags on",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight

71,Kamil_An,Another mediocre movie!,6,29 October 2020,"There are some ups and downs in this movie. Let's begin with the pros, well, the setting of the movie is a real bullseye! You can feel the nostalgia while watching a movie that takes place in a forest, especially in the area of a lake. It's as if you were part of that movie, pulls you into it, perhaps. Moreover, the actors (I'm quite familiar with both main female protagonists of this movie) performed really well, maybe lost the pace here and there, but overall, it was quite pleasant watching them. What's more, the dubbing was spot on, really well done!Let's move on to the cons, the first one is the actual storyline, it is focusing on a group of kids in the middle of nowhere; cut off from the entire world and 2 ""human"" creatures that are hunting them down, one by one. The ""human"" type creatures sort of resemble the fat green monster that lives in a swamp, yes, shrek. Really disappointed with such antagonists, they aren't interesting whatsoever. If instead of those creatures we saw a killer on the loose, I'd be hitting that 8 or even 9/10. In addition, some of the secondary protagonists are just flat characters, nothing special and quite boring! Last but not least, most scenes are very predictable, so there is no wow factor.To sum up, I do recommend this movie for the nostalgia that it builds and the setting, but definitely not for the storyline. Therefore, we are having another mediocre movie at the end of the day.6/10",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight

it is just one horror movie stereotype after the next. I don't think there was a single thing I hadn't seen a billion times before.

It's really predictable and full of clichés, which is even pointed out by one the characters in the plot of the film. Actually, it's really similar to Wrong Turn and some themes are literally taken straight out of The Ritual and The Cabin. It's like you're watching horror movies that you already know, so the whole thing is hardly surprising and definitely not creative.
What is surprising, though, is the soundtrack - suffice it to say that it's weird... Reminds me of The Goonies from 1985. And the 'monsters' were created quite well.
I was really glad to see a lot of new faces on the screen. Surely, this wasn't the debut for some of the young actors, but still it was entertaining to see new talents.
I quite enjoyed it, although there were two or three moments when I couldn't help laughing out loud since the scene was so predictable or out of common sense. Watching this film you really need to stop analysing and thinking - just enjoy what you're served.

I guess the supernatural part is how the brothers can't be killed but they also threw in a sci fi meteorite that could explain this. I came to the reviews to see if anyone understood how Bartek got away from one of the mutants only to be killed by the mailman but then I remembered they never explained how the mailman lived either. I even went to the wiki which goes from Bartek being discovered by the killer then jumps to him killed by the mailman as if the killer only wanted to play hide and seek. It also never explained why the mutant brothers were allowed to continue living in their house after taking the mailman's legs 30 years earlier.

Characters volunteer themselves in to situations any normal human would 100% avoid such as:Not taking a 2 day hike out the forest and opting to try and retrieve a phone from the murderers house whilst they are there.Hiding in the confession booth! Literally the only place where you cannot escape from.Car doesn't start.....dumb, lazy move!Reversing said car over the killer when you had a clear run to safety!There is so much wrong with this movie, I imagine the film makers thought watching episodes of goosebumps make for good horror research!!Character backstories have zero relevance on anything going on, they are used as filler for the weak plot linesAfter the movie finished my only comment was ""my kid could have directed a more consice movie than this trash""There's a sequel.....you won't see a review of it from me!!",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight
94,wyrzykowskikajetan,Ill-conceived story with multiple genre tropes and plotholes,3,23 May 2020,"Bartosz Kowalski's W Lesie Dzis Nic Zasnie Nikt (2020) works neither as a proper homage to the vintage, nor an inventive satire on its themes. Sadly, it's not even remotely entertaining either.Admittedly, horror has been the domain of American and Asian cinema. Indeed, the argument could be made that European moviegoers were spoiled by the foreign influx. That, however, shouldn't mean that in-house productions are all trash. Thanks to people such as Robert Eggers, Ari Aster, Julia Ducournau and Ben Wheatley, horror fans in Europe begin to get choosy too. So, in order to make the headlines, you really have to push the envelope. Polish director Bartosz Kowalski couldn't stray further away from that goal.Kowalski's anchor is an almost mute character Zosia. She's played by Polish juvenile celebrity Julia Wieniawa-Narkiewicz, whose bland, uninterested face speaks volumes about the whole film. Furthermore, it's also her poorly developed arch, which doesn't help the inexperienced actress build a role worth investing in. And since that's the only emotional leverage up Bartosz Kowalski's sleeve, you get the picture.Let's be honest - nobody watches slashers for agitated debates on the meaning of life or character development. If anything, it's the bloodshed that counts.The gore and scares in W Lesie Dzis Nic Zasnie Nikt (2020) are stylistically close to the Wrong Turn movies. It's largely over-the-top, with bodies cut in two, beaten up against a tree and minced. So, the blood's there, but style isn't.That too leaves W Lesie Dzis Nic Zasnie Nikt (2020) far from modern masterpieces. Thee visible budget constraints play their part here, yet a few horrors succeeded despite facing similar issues. Look at Creep (2015), and the legendary The Blair Witch project (1999) to grasp what I'm getting there. These films were brilliant in avoiding the formulaic paths. For Bartosz Kowalski, sticking his head out means leaving his comfort zone. And the director is clearly not ready for that kind of commitment.Eventually, this entire effort is just as fruitless as this camp that tries to convert kids from online to offline. One tedious slasher won't change the European horror game. But in the of W Lesie Dzis Nic Zasnie Nikt (2020) case, that actually may be a good thing.",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight

I found the start interesting enough, and having a low budget I stayed with it. I don't mind the same old story with slasher films, as I find it fun. Also the scene where the chap is explaining to a very attractive girl how he finds it hard being gay, then wonders why she hasn't responded...........made me laugh my head off, because I didn't expect it. Also the weirdo priest being murdered horribly made me giggle. And as I said before, a film made in Poland on a low budget deserves so much respect to you guys. But deep down I found the story a little silly, especially with why the boys turned violent in the first place. Too many ideas and genres can spoil something which should be simple.

The trailer and opening had the late 70s/ 80s style of horror music on which grabbed me. There are some funny parts that I'm not sure if it was meant to be funny, or it's just my sense of humour. I'll just say this without saying too much. It's a camp where teens are sent to because they're addicted to technology and their devices. Funny enough premise? I think so. The movie is from Poland and is dubbed into English or at least the version I watched. I normally prefer subtitles but for an old school style horror film, the English dub made it that much more fun.

114,dqfkxykd,A true homage and well worth your time!,9,31 October 2021,"""Nobody sleeps in the woods tonight"" plays like a textbook horror/slasher. But being conscious of every trope it follows, it manages to become something much more than generic. It's a festive, well made, and joyous homage to 70's non-apologetic movie making. Script is witty, self-indulgent and thought provoking. Cinematography is on point. The characters feel grounded, the suspense is real, and the gore and body horror is top-notch.Movie feels like if ""Slither"" and ""The Cabin in the woods"" made an abhorrent love child, with the guise of ""Halloween"", and a pinch of ""Chainsaw Massacre"".Don't go into this expecting a revelation or a new wave of horror, it's not necessarily a prodigy in the genre. But what it is, is unusually well-made homage that manages to stand on its own.Why this movie is rated so low is beyond me.

The cinematography and framework should be a case study for any indiefilmmakers wanting to delve into the horror genre.The direction, and effort from cast and crew are to be commended. This is a fun ride and delivers on all fronts in terms of what audiences want from what I would call a ""Monster in the House"" genre .1. You have the monster(s) 2. the house, being some remote teen camp and forest area in poland where kids go to get free from their addiction to technology.
3. The Sin - which maybe the story is trying to take a look at peoples addictionsI like the protagonist a young girl who has lost her parents in a car accident, and her sidekick successful gamer/streamer who has amassed a huge following but needs to grower braver in the real world.I loved following these characters as they get deeper into trouble.My real criticism with the story is more around the origin story of the Monsters.
Its a little too close to the Venom origin story ... hopefully it doesnt end it a lawsuit.

A priest who slaps then restrains a kid for reasons never revealed. The priest then leaves the kid in church and wanders outside, just to be killed by one of the twins and fed into a wood chipper.This movie just doesn't know what it wants to be.

You can easily guess that they, along with their camp guide, are going to die one by one except for Zosia who has a deeper backstory. Some of the characters do evolve, but they lack depth.Also, there are some plot holes/inconsistencies that I felt make the movie rather complete. My questions:1. What happened to the twins' father? I see a picture of him and his wife, but there is no mention of him.
2. How does the postman make it out alive?
3. What is the context of the meteorite, and what about the black goo coming out of it?
4. How does Barket survive that deformed monster?
5. What becomes of Zosia?
6. What about the suspicious priest?
7. What happened to the rest of the camp participants?I'm not a big fan of gore and killings, but I feel like they should make a sequel to answer all these questions.

152,dalethomson,Its sucking my will to live!,2,29 December 2020,"I really wanted to have a good experience with this film, a lot of ""foreign language"" films get looked over simply because they're different, however this film is probably deserving of the ignorance.First, I'll preface this by saying I watched this on Netflix, so I don't know if this a fault on their behalf, but the SUBTITLES, oh the subtitles! Though they're mostly in the same ballpark, they're often quite different from what's being said, which for someone with partial deafness, is both distracting and confusing. As for what's being said, the dubbing is wild. The ""bimbo"" character uses the word ""shag"" to refer to herself, and the one shining example of the LGBTQ community refers to himself solely as a ""f*g"" which in 2020 is just wrong.The acting has stilted and unnatural flow, a brings about the cringe-inducing s*x scene. The two characters involved discover they have similar names, which leads to... intercourse somehow? Like that's effectively the lead up, with the scene itself being absmally awkward, a very out-of-place song playing as these teens bump uglies.Right after that scene, the girl walks off and the boy, for SOME REASON, decides to sleep on the sandy ground that he'd previously left his tent to visit for some herbal refreshment, sleeping bag and all. This leads to the scene that made me dislike this movie firmly, the ""monster"" finds this character, obviously, and decides to rip off an iconic scene from Friday the 13th, wherein he is slammed against a tree whilst trapped in a sleeping bag.The film had been rather uninspired from the start, with its cheap jumpscares that failed to even evoke the slightest movement when they flopped onto the screen. But that took the cake, or so I thought.From the fat kid saying ""game over man, game over"" to the guide just straight up killing herself by not moving, to the ham-fisted wood chipper scene, this movie just alludes to better films that I could be watching instead of this giant cliche, I could respect the nods to them, and the unoriginal premise, if it simply did something new, or presented itself as a parody.
But it doesn't.It's just a meh movie with less than average watchabilty, at least films like ""the room"" and ""troll 2"" had a campy fun atmosphere and quotable lines, this film surpasses the ""so bad it's good"" line and just goes back into bad.The only (small) saving grace of the movies is the gore and monster makeup, most of which appears to be practical. They show a decent measure of quality that only highlights how much potential this movie had, only to be drove into the ground by its failures. I also kinda liked some of the music, although it was totally unsuitable for the scenes they were in.TL;DR:
Maybe a laugh if you're getting intoxicated with some friends, but if you're looking for a decent horror movie, be it fun and campy, or genuinely scary, look elsewhere.",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight

157,gmn1,Impressive and very entertaining Backwoods Horror like it should be!,8,30 October 2020,"Saw this movie on Netflix yesterday and thought at first that it is some comedy movie (because of the title and cover) but it turned out to be a perfectly well dont horror movie. I was even more excited after knowing it was shot in poland (i am from germany) because there are not many horrormovies made in the EU in the last decades.the actors are professional troughout the movie. i dont see a difference to any hollywood or big budget independent movie at all.The writing is - especially in the first third of the movie - very original. You think about some clichè but the writing goes in another direction just at the right moment. for example, in every american slasher movie, the muscular dude is a bully. hes not a bully in this one. in fact hes a virgin and he dies first (clichè would be that virgins die last). There are many more examples like this where i thought that it seems that the writer intentionally broke clichè and i likethat very much about the movie.color grading, sfx, music, camera and so on, are all top level. Creature design, too and i really liked it. Music has ben done very well and i wonder which track they used sometimes throughout the movie that seems uplifting and joyful, really like this melody.As for comparisons, i would put this movie higher than any friday the 13th movie.
this movie could easily be in the same row as the hills have eyes remake or wrong turn (the first part) which i really really like, but it has a few (and really only a few) downsides....Once you let the horror start, never let it stop again! This is something, every horror director has to learn (including myself, i made 2 movies up to now (FPS : First Person Shooter and Hellstone). I appreciate the background story of the two mutants but thought it was a bit too detailed. Regarding the alien ""infection"" this reminded me of the x-files or venom (the black stuff) and i think it would have been way better if the asteroid had just glowed or maybe released some radiation or dust. After all, pace is everything and there are 2 ways to pin people to their seats. 1. slow and steady suspension (like in shining or high tension from alexandre aja 2. a explosion of horror that does not stop til the movie is over like in evil dead. Those are just some suggestions to the writer, though he really did a great job on the movie.All in all, i was really happy that i found this movie on netflix and i think that mr. kowalski (and the team involved) has got great talent and i hope that he will pursue filmmaking further and i look forward to future movies of him and the team.Great work !!!",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight
158,glpv8485,I fell asleep in the woods sometimes,5,1 April 2021,"It's an entertaining movie, but not the best slasher movie I've ever seen. Sometimes it got extremely annoying and predictable, but, not the worst thing I've ever seen, gore was really good.About the final girl: I understood that her family died, but why was she sent to that camp? Was she addicted to technology? The death of his family have to do with that? So many things unsolved.",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight

161,belleinpastel,"If you're new to horror/slashers and it's clichés or don't mind them, this is the movie for you. Otherwise, maybe stay clear.",3,14 September 2021,"Having just watched it, there were so many odd decisions within the movie that I just had to add my two cents. Spoilers ahead!Starting the movie, I was a big fan of the setting and premise they established: campers who're there to overcome their technology addiction go on a three-day hike and start getting killed one by one by a slasher monster dude. I'm always a sucker for a camp setting, and the idea that they all have their own reasons for being addicted to technology and have to overcome it throughout the movie as a nice idea. But it was just that, and idea. The movie never actually went ANYWHERE with it, instead just unsing it as an excuse to get all these kids together at camp, but like any other regular camp will do, so I really have no idea why they introduced the idea of tech dependency and overcoming it when it wasn't explored AT ALL. Well, I won't say ""at all"" since we did get a taste of it when they were at the campfire and Julek tells us his backstory, but I'm serious when I say that's genuinely IT. That's all we get in relation to the tech dependency plot, then it's completely forgotten. You could argue that it's also used to explore Zosia's backstory, but it really isn't. We never see her being dependent on tech after the tragic accident of her parents (or even at all), so the tech idea could have been written out of the plot entirely and her backstory would have still worked scene for scene.Then there was the music, which was a choice. I personally didn't care for it or thought it was even jarring or clashed with the scene at times as if the music was trying to push for a more comedic or light tone, but the scene itself didn't convey that at all (the priest getting grinded in the wood chipper for example), but I also recognize that that's a matter of personal taste.And finally, there were many, MANY times in the movie where a character did something completely baffling and just like, ""why???"". It felt less like the characters being stupid, and more like the writers absolutely HAVING to get them killed, so they wrote them doing something completely out of character and idiotic and left field. For example, with Miss Iza. She's shown throughout her screen time to be a dependable leader to the children, having a strong mental head on her shoulders, able to perform first aid, and able to keep calm under pressure. But then they all just waltz into the killer's house (I don't blame the character, mostly just the writing and cliché of horror in general), but when they're inevitably cornered by the monster and the others have climbed out the window and she has ample amount of time to do so as well, she hears the phone on a dead corpse ring, and instead of doing the sensible thing of going out the window (guaranteed survival), she instead decides to go for the phone, but also not really?? It's written under that guise of that decision yeah, but instead all she does is actually just pick up a stick and try to whack the monster with it. So in the end, she chose not to escape, but decided to go for the phone, but then I guess just forgot the moment she turned around???? Like it genuinely made no sense logic-wise, ESPECIALLY for a character like hers.There were many scenes like this throughout the WHOLE film that just left me frustrated with it's writing for the sake of convenience (in having these characters killed off). Such as:-Aniela's death, where she sat and TOLD us (not showed us) all about her character and her true feelings (ppl see me as the dumb slutty blonde, but I want to find true love some day), but like literally the whole movie they only showed her being the dumb slutty blonde, then right after her confession of her wanting to find true love and the potential to SHOW character development, they kill her off. Like literally RIGHT AFTER. It made me think how such a waste of a character she was and what she could have been had they started her development earlier in the film.-Bartek's death, where he somehow escaped one of the monsters in the church?? It should NOT have been possible, and it was never explained, then suddenly he shows up at the mailman's door (who also hadn't been explained how he survived), WITHOUT KNOCKING, and gets shot. Overall just an avoidable death (or like, they could have just had him killed by the monster in the church, would have been less confusing and just out of nowhere for no reason).-The plan with Zosia and Julek to get the monster out of the house, where they had agreed for Julek to get the monster's attention and lure it away for Zosia to get the phone in the basement. So Julek knocks on the front door with the intention of having it come and run after him, but like mid scene as Zosia's digging for the phone, Julek just stops knocking on the door for some god damn unexplained reason???? Which obviously gets Zosia attacked and ends up getting Julek killed. But again, the movie gives literally NO reason as to why he just stops their agreed upon plan mid way, and it just really felt like it was simply the writers writing it that way for a convenient conflict, but they forgot to add logic.It wasn't the worst movie I've seen, and the premise and setting were very promising, but overall the holes in the writing just left too big of an unpleasant experience for me to rate this higher.",Nobody Sleeps in the Woods Tonight
