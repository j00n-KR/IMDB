0,MartinHafer,A rather dumb movie with some very funny moments...,4,6 May 2011,"You do not watch ""Old School"" if you are looking for intellectual stimulation. Also, while it's got some very funny moments (such as the CPR scene), it really isn't a very good film, as the plot really makes no sense and the movie is wildly uneven.Three irresponsible jerks (Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell) have lives that are either a mess or they're about to make a mess. All three characters (especially Wilson and Vaughn) REALLY make no sense--like their characters are only about 50% written. For example, Wilson is supposed to be a really nice and decent guy--so why does he always agree to do such immoral things?! Vaughn is married and spends most of the film being a major jerk and encouraging his friends to be man-whores---like he's vicariously living through these guys. Huh?! Well, the three WHO ARE NOT STUDENTS decide to start a fraternity(?!) but Dean Wormer (or whoever) is a kill-joy who wants to shut down this den of debauchery. And the rest of the film is basically ""Animal House"" and ""Revenge of the Nerds""--just not as original and not as good.What is good about the film? Well, a few bits here and there are quite funny--and most involve Will Ferrell. In fact, Ferrell came off best in the film because his character was purely comic relief and didn't need to make sense! So, when Ferrell runs naked through the campus, it is funny because it is appealing to a low-brow and primal sense of humor. 'Blue' was also quite funny, as this character was purely for comic relief. But as for the rest of the cast, they often tried to bounce between comedy and drama--and it just didn't work. They came off as incomplete and clichéd. Not a bad movie if you just want brainless raunchy comedy but it could have been so much better...easily.",Old School
1,SnoopyStyle,Will Ferrell and Todd Phillips break out,8,16 February 2014,"Mitch (Luke Wilson) tries to move on with his life after his girlfriend (Juliette Lewis) cheats on him. When he buys a house after a professor died, the college dean Gordon Pritchard (Jeremy Piven) rezones the house for campus use only. So Mitch's buddies Mitch (Will Ferrell) and Beanie (Vince Vaughn) decide to start a fraternity at the house. That doesn't stop the dean from trying to kick Mitch out.This is the break out movie role for Will Ferrell. It's always funny to have a drunk naked white guy on the loose. It's also a break out for director Todd Phillips. It's charming. It's hilarious. It's stupid, and it's got its heart in the right place. The three guys have great fraternal chemistry. That's what this is all about.",Old School
2,claudio_carvalho,Very Silly,6,22 November 2004,"Mitch Martin (Luke Wilson) returns home earlier from a seminar and finds his mate Heidi (Juliette Lewis) in a gangbang. He quits his relationship and moves to a comfortable house in the campus of a university. However, the foolish Dean Gordon Pritchard (Jeremy Piven), who studied in the same high school as him, tries to make him leave the place since he is not a student anymore. Mitch's friends Bernard Campbell (Vince Vaugh) and Frank Ricard (Will Ferrell) convince him to transform his place in a fraternity, giving loud parties to the community. Frank has just got married, but he is not living with his wife anymore because he saw him drunk and running naked on the street a few days after their marriage. Beanie is married, has a successful business and moves everywhere with his baby. Mitch meets his former crush Nicole (Ellen Pompeo) and falls in love with her again. This movie is very silly. There are some laughable parts, but the story is very absurd. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): 'Dias Incríveis' ('Incredible Days')",Old School
3,gavin6942,Probably the Quintessential Will Ferrell Film,7,12 June 2006,"Sure, you could watch ""Anchorman"" or ""Elf"" or ""Wedding Crashers""... but if you want real Luke Wilson and Will Ferrell action, you want to see ""Old School"".A group of 30-year old men turn a house into a fraternity to recapture their days of beer-drinking and women-catching. But once the dean finds out, it becomes an all out war between these men and the establishment.The cast is perfect: besides Wilson and Ferrell, you have Vince Vaughn, Elisha Cuthbert, that girl from ""Rushmore"", Jeremy Piven, and a variety of other cameos. Even James Carville, who is just about the last person you expect to appear in a sophomoric comedy of this type. Well, second to last: Robert Novak would have been stranger.I have no complaints to make about this film. If you're familiar with the work of these gentlemen, you know what you're getting already. And this is the cream of the crop. If you like their other movies and not this one, I think you're probably out of your mind or on some mind-altering drug like Ketamine. Because how can you not appreciate this? Oh, and it has Terry O'Quinn and Snoop Dogg. Seriously, watch it.",Old School
4,jboothmillard,Old School,5,11 September 2008,"Although EuroTrip is more the same territory, this is a good natured and almost as funny follow-up to Road Trip from same director Todd Phillips. Basically Mitch Martin (Luke Wilson, Owen's brother) has his nymphomaniac girlfriend Heidi (Juliette Lewis) cheat on him, Frank Ricard (Will Ferrell) gets married but can't let go of his party animal life, and Bernard 'Beanie' Campbell (Vince Vaughn) is a bored family man, so all three are disillusioned by their normal lives. Beanie suggests they from their own fraternity (male organisation) in Mitch's new house on college campus to relive their glory days bringing together a variety of misfit college students, and all ages and sizes are welcome. After a while though the new student Dean, Gordon 'Cheese' Pritchard (Scary Movie 3's Jeremy Piven) threatens to evict Mitch and his friends, who has a grudge against, from his house, unless they can prove themselves worthy college student material (or whatever), by taking some tests, physical and mental. Also starring Ellen Pompeo as Nicole, Leah Remini as Lara Campbell, Perrey Reeves as Marissa Jones, Craig Kilborn as Mark, The Girl Next Door's Elisha Cuthbert as Darcie, American Pie and Road Trip's Seann William Scott as Peppers, Snoop Dogg, Warren G. and Lost's Terry O'Quinn as Goldberg. Wilson isn't as laid back or fun-loving apart from at the parties, so Ferrell and Vaughn are the two that steal the show and create most laughs in this pretty good comedy. Worth watching!",Old School
5,Quinoa1984,ehh...wait till cable,6,8 May 2003,"Here lies the college party movie of the season, from the director of the successful and uproarious Road Trip, but for some reason Old School never seems to have the energy or humor that could be expected.  The premise has promise of course- Wilson plays Mitch, a guy who comes home to find his girlfriend hosting an orgy.  When his big-time, speaker store friend Beanie (Vaughn) hears of this development, he dutifully encourages him, along with their friend Frank (Ferrell) to start up a fraternity in Wilson's new house which is right next to campus and has everything to with partying and nothing to do with studying.  Soon their pledges come from all walks of life; even a ninety-year old joins in on the fun.  The laughs come in spurts, but a problem is that the film rests most of its laughs on the shoulders of Ferrell.  And while he's dependable throughout with his style (two highlights include when he's drunk running through the streets and another is when he burns out at a party following an end to his marriage), Wilson acts like he usually does in the B comedies he stars in that only appear to be on the shelves at blockbuster, and Vaughn's character comes off as the rather obnoxious thirty-something businessman turned party dude not many want to associate with after five minutes.  Jeremy Piven also comes up short-changes as he tries to pull a 180 from his role in PCU.  It wasn't a waste of a comedy, but less than I expected; Snoop Dogg makes such a brief cameo he doesn't have time to mouth a shizzel before exiting. C+",Old School
6,ComedyFan2010,A fun and easy comedy,8,13 May 2015,"The movie is not very original but it fulfills its purpose as a comedy, since one just can't stop laughing through it.It is based on the common fraternity comedies, but with a little twist that the main characters are now in their 30's. The movie doesn't go too much into detail, but it isn't supposed to be believable either.We get a bunch of different kinds of characters who all are funny in their own way. Besides the main characters I really liked to see well known actors playing small parts, such as Simon Helberg, Juliette Lewis and Jeremy Piven.I like how this movie mainly sticks to the comedy and keeps the dramatic, learning moments to a minimum. Just as I love that at the end not all of them decided to ""grow up"" but Will Ferrel's character keeps on having his fun. I was a bit worried they will make it look as if boring married life is for everybody.",Old School
7,edwagreen,Old School- Same Nonsense *,1,3 January 2008,"I would expect this film being created by lower functioning junior high school students.The premise of three guys opening up a fraternity home near the school where they graduated from is absolutely ridiculous to begin with.The only good thing here is Jeremy Piven, who has personal reasons for wanting to break up this nonsense. As the dean of the school, he tries but the writing is so bad and inane that his reasoning soon falls off the charts.The film also follows the love lives of these 3 jerks-Vince Vaughn, Will Ferrell and Luke Wilson. Each story is more absurd than the other. Well, Wilson falls for the boss's daughter. That could have been played up more as far as the reaction of the boss finding out. The boss doesn't even find out that his daughter has been sleeping with the Wilson character.The picture defies logic. Having an 89 year old frat member dropping dead in the middle of exercise is just too stupid to discuss. At his funeral, Vaughn's comments that all old people die, said in front of an elderly woman is heartless and in poor taste.How much longer must we be subjected to Hollywood's goal of trying to satisfy the youth by coming up with films that lack sanity?",Old School
8,wes-connors,More Fun Than an Assassination,1,1 February 2010,"Luke Wilson (as Mitch), Will Ferrell (as Frank), and Vince Vaughn (as Beanie) star as three dumb old dudes who open a ""frat house"" and act stupid. But, this is no ""Animal House"". Think frat, fat, and fag jokes. And, they're not even funny. Snoop Dogg and James Carville appear as lame versions of themselves. If that's not enough to turn you off, be forewarned - the performers you'd least like to see naked take off the most clothes, with Mr. Ferrell's bare ass hanging around for an interminable length of time. Apologies are in order. Director/co-writer/co-producer Todd Phillips may have taken it the wrong way when someone told him, ""This movie should be shot."" * Old School (2/13/03) Todd Phillips ~ Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, Jeremy Piven",Old School
9,Coventry,Average slapstick...good soundtrack!,5,1 February 2004,"Instead of horny teenagers like in Phillips' last film Road Trip, we're introduced here to a bunch of horny men in their early 30's. Married, trapped in routine jobs and longing for their collage days. The three of them carefully select a larger group of losers and they start their own fraternity. Old School perfectly fits in the popular category of 'sex and booze'-comedies. Will Ferell is cast best as the former party animal who suffers from an early midlife crisis. His career contains multiple low-brained comedies already but Old School is easily one of the best. Vince Vaughn doesn't really belong in a cast like this but he makes the best out of it. So does Luke Wilson...that guy is a lot better than his overrated brother Owen, in my opinion. There are many gorgeous looking girls walking through the screen, nice cameo's ( by Sean William Scott for example ), there's a terrible forced happy ending and we even get to see a little bit of ravishing female flesh...what more do you want? Oh yeah, the film has a really good soundtrack! The best aspect about the entire film is the terrific use of catchy songs at the right moment! The best sequences are supported by songs like 'Master of Puppets' by Metallica, 'The Sound of Silence' by Simon & Garfunkel and 'Here I go again' by Whitesnake. Paying attention to the soundtrack is definitely recommended when you're watching this average comedy.",Old School
10,sunwarrior13,All About Escapism,7,4 November 2011,"Old School is a comedy that stars stars Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, and Will Ferrell as three thirty-somethings who seek to re-live their college days by starting a fraternity, and the tribulations they encounter in doing so in order to avoid the problems of the present.The story was written by Court Crandall and directed by Todd Phillips.Old School has a premise wherein three men relive their carefree college years by killing off as many brain cells as possible in this movie. Mitch returns home from a less-than-pleasant business trip one evening to discover his wife, Heidi is involved in a threesome with two blindfolded strangers. Feeling less than welcome at home after this, Mitch rents a house near the campus of a nearby college.Two of his old college buddies,Beanie and Frank, stop by to cheer him up. They soon become regular guests at Mitch's place, despite the fact that Frank only recently wed Marissa,while Beanie and his wife, Lara, are busy with two kids. Beanie decides to throw a housewarming party for Mitch, and since Beanie sells audio equipment for a living, he's able to trick out the big bash with a massive PA system and an appearance by Snoop Dogg. Mitch soon finds he's the not-entirely-willing proprietor of the school's leading party spot, which raises the ire of Mr.Pritchard, a dean at the college who was the target of Mitch, Frank, and Beanie's abuse when they were all students.Mr.Pritchard arranges to have Mitch's neighborhood zoned into a student housing district, but Beanie and Frank respond by forming a fraternity and making Mitch's home their headquarters. Mitch, however, is not enthusiastic about the idea, especially as he's trying to impress Nicole, a beautiful divorcée who is less than enchanted with Frank and Beanie's ""care-free"" lifestyle. Old School is an definitely an over-the-top comedy that is not totally hilarious although it had some funny moments.The theme about escapism was somewhat not really that impressed me about the movie since the premise about the trio of buds who yearn to go back to the past in order to avoid the present only brings them to more problems.Aside from that,most of the humor involved is that's somewhere below the belt.And most of all,it became an exercise of laughs,whether funny or not,in the course of the film.Overall,Old School is a comedy that tries to help you escape from the present troubles of life but it nevertheless fails to deliver.",Old School
11,Boba_Fett1138,Great fun simple comedy.,6,6 October 2007,"Basically this is a great comedy to watch late at night. It's nothing too fancy or original but it's basically good quality entertainment, from a great genre director and a real solid cast, filled with some of the best actors currently active in the genre.The real most surprising thing about ""Old School"" is its cast. It's not only filled with some great leading actors but also lots of famous faces in small roles and cameos, such as Juliette Lewis, Elisha Cuthbert, Seann William Scott and Harve Presnell, among others. But of course the movie gets carried by the three main leading men; Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn. Will Ferrell is such a show stealer! He has the best moments and lines in the movie. And Vince Vaughn once again shows that he is a great actor actually.Perhaps the concept of the movie called for some more and better thought of jokes but nevertheless the movie doesn't feel as if it's not entertaining enough already now. In the end not all of the plot-lines get wrapped up properly or satisfactorily but you know, in a comedy you just tend to forgive this sort of storytelling flaws.What I liked about the movie is that it greatly mixes the comical and the more dramatic and personal elements of the movie. The one doesn't distract from the other, which is I think due to the professional genre directing of genre specialist Todd Phillips, who also directed movies such as ""Road Trip"" and ""Starsky & Hutch"". It's probably not a comedy that will go in the books as the most hilarious or best one of all time but the movie serves its purpose and that's to simply entertaining the viewer, with more than a couple of good laughs.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Old School
12,view_and_review,Silly Fun,7,21 February 2021,"""Old School"" is a nutty comedy about three friends starting a fraternity. It's a comedy in the same vein as ""Animal House,"" ""Porky's Revenge,"" or ""Road Trip,"" which are about hormonal young males drinking, partying, and having sex, except the hormonal males in ""Old School"" aren't exactly young---which makes it all the more hilarious. By all rights, they shouldn't have a fraternity nor should they be in one. Beanie (Vince Vaughn) was married with two kids, Frank (Will Ferrell) was a newlywed, and Mitch (Luke Wilson) just got out of a committed relationship. They were all 30+ and their partying days should've been behind them. Yet they started a fraternity in Mitch's new home as a means of making sure that the house, that was near the college campus, remained committed to campus related activities.Necessity is the mother of all inventions.Their fraternity was unique in that it was a blend of students at the nearby college and adult non-students of varying ages. Blue (Patrick Cranshaw) was close to 90!!The whole thing was a gas. This was just silly fun you couldn't help but laugh at.",Old School
13,anaconda-40658,Let's Go Streaking!,7,11 May 2015,"Old School (2003): Dir: Todd Phillips / Cast: Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Will Ferrell, Juliette Lewis, Jeremy Piven: Plays like a followup to the superior National Lampoon's Animal House celebrating the decay of human decency. It is a comedy about carefree memories of generations gone by. Luke Wilson arrives home from a business trip and discovers his girlfriend engaged in an orgy. He moves out and finds a place near university campus. Vince Vaughn runs a stereo store and believes that he has the answers to their problems. They will start a fraternity and relive years gone by. Will Ferrell is their recently married friend who streaks naked through the neighbourhood after a drunken celebration at the frat house. Directed by Todd Phillips in the same vein as his Road Trip. Wilson plays off the doormat disposition while Vaughn throws out one-liners. Ferrell steals the film with a hilarious performance but we sympathize as he gradually wrecks his marriage. Juliette Lewis plays Wilson's ex girlfriend in a role that is hardly broad. Jeremy Piven plays the young snotty Dean but he has none of the comic conviction of a Dean Wormer. The humour drains when the climax involves settling down and studying. In National Lampoon's Animal House the fraternity is kicked off campus and they wreck the home coming parade. Recalling past events deserves more than a hopeless outlook on life. Score: 7 ½ / 10",Old School
14,Sylviastel,"Fill it up again! Fill it up again! Once it hits your lips, it's so good!",5,14 May 2020,"I am usually fine with Will Ferrell movies but this isn't one of my favorites. An all star cast can't keep the film up to comedic standards. The film is like a modern day Animal House with thirty year olds. Yes, there are lot of gross and uncomfortable parts in watching this film. There is vulgarity, profanity and some unsuitable material for anybody really.

This film will not age well, and become forgotten like most of this party type films."" Boy, was I wrong Old School ages well and is a time honoured classic. Well written, directed, with the perfect cast. All the actors became stars in the own films. Everyone was at the right age to make this film. I am happy they never made an Old School 2! This film is so great I repeat lines from it. ""Going to the home depot"" is one I use all the time. If I am asked what I am doing over the weekend. I give Old School a ten out of ten.",Old School
16,StevePulaski,An inferior recipe for a good comedy,5,17 July 2012,"There are comedies that rely on cleverly placed wit, comedies that rely on characters, raunchy comedies that try to construct a new set up with likable characters, or ones with a familiar set up with likable characters. Then there are ones that simply compile caricatures to aimlessly wander around their screenplay of odds and ends. This is the primary formula for Todd Phillips' Old School.Mitch Martin (Luke Wilson) is a successful attorney, who is perhaps too consumed in his work. This becomes evident to him when he returns home to discover his girlfriend takes part in wild sex orgies. They obviously break up, Mitch is upset, and then goes house-hunting before closing the deal on a house not too far away from Harrison University. His best friends, Frank (Will Ferrell) and Bernard (Vince Vaughn) get the ingenious idea to relive their college days, reelect themselves at the top of the social circuit, and drink, party, and have sex as much as possible. This, of course, becomes crucial to their already well-constructed home-lives, where Frank has just gotten married and Bernard runs a successful chain of electronic stores.While its main characters are adults, Phillips' gives the screenplay of Old School a ""frat-boy comedy"" injection with frat-boy comedy humor. There's a distinct lack of humanity within the characters, who talk mostly to service the vague plot and not at leisure, and for that matter, they are so dense and unsatisfying one questions whether or not they are the ideal kind you would like to see in a comedy in the first place.Old School is yet another modern-day clone of a more successful seventies comedy that doesn't need to be named. It's the kind of movie that was amazing in its heyday, still relatively holds up today, but has been done so many times by inferior works that some jokes may seems tired and worn. That film is a great work of comedic timing and characters. Old School is just a vague guide on the recipe for a good comedy.Starring: Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, Jeremy Piven, and Elisha Cuthbert. Directed by: Todd Phillips.",Old School
17,Smells_Like_Cheese,Has it's very funny moments,7,15 June 2006,"This is like a new Animal House per say for a new generation. I normally don't get too much into the fraternity movies, they are mostly guy humor that I really don't get into. While I wasn't too into the movie, I have got to admit that Will Ferrel's character just made me laugh so hard and out loud. He was just so crazy but very funny. There is no cheesy lovey dovey moments and I think this movie evened itself out pretty well. Although, I didn't get the love story, it was way too quick and frankly, not needed. I would recommend Old School for a good laugh. We have Will, Luke, and Vince, some of today's greatest comedic performers who give their all in a comedy. So, grab the popcorn and get ready to laugh! 7/10",Old School
18,=G=,Marginal,6,14 June 2003,"""Old School"" is a marginal attempt a campus comedy which tells of some thirty-something guys who try to start a Frat house near their alma mater...etc. The film begins with some promising fresh material but peaks early and fizzles after morphing into just more of the same old stuff as it grinds to its conclusion. The human story of alumni camaraderie and love/like relationships don't work on any level,  the casting is questionable save the principal players, and the screen play lacks continuity and doesn't build. Taken as a whole, the film is passable stuff which will play best with couch potatoes in need of some mindless humor which doesn't get too gross. (C+)",Old School
19,MovieAddict2016,Animals of the House,6,7 July 2003,"""Old School"" is as funny as it is an homage to ""Animal House."" It is about three guys who try to relive their college glory days by starting a college fraternity off-campus, where anyone who likes to party can join. But to understand why this happens, you must understand the stick-skinny plot.Luke Wilson plays Mitch, a lawyer who wanders home from a seminar one night to find his wife with two naked strangers. After his divorce, Mitch moves into a house near a college campus...only to find out that the house is to be repossessed by the college unless it is turned into a fraternity. So Mitch and his two friends, Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and Frank ""The Tank"" (Will Ferrell, the funniest guy in the film), start a fraternity, where their initiation is a method of trust. Those interested in joining the fraternity must drop a cement block (which is tied to a...""sensitive area"") from a twenty foot drop, hoping the line doesn't pick up any slack. One of the most hilarious segments is this scene, which had me on the floor in laughter.But trouble ensues when Frank's favorite fraternity member, ""Blue,"" an eighty-nine-year-old-man, dies in the house, causing everyone in school to be booted from college and causing Mitch to lose his house. Unless they can prove to the college board that they have a meaningful existence as a fraternity. ""Old School"" is at its best when it is cruel. ""Old School"" is the ""Animal House"" for today's generation. It comes as no surprise that its creators also made the rude, crude film ""Road Trip,"" a film I have yet to see but hear isn't all that great. To tell you the truth, ""Old School"" isn't great, either, but it has a cruel streak running through it that is hilarious. It's like a person not afraid to speak their mind. It had me in tears, and at other times, glancing at my watch.For example, take the scene where a fat college-goer drops a cement block from his sensitive area to join the college, only to have it fall through a pot-hole and suck him through. Or when the same guy has to do gymnastics to demonstrate athleticism to the college board. Or when Frank gets shot by a tranquilizer dart at a birthday party, and falls into the pool and wrecks the little boy's party. Or the running gag about a kitchen device Mitch bought Frank for his wedding (Frank tries to give it away numerous times, including to Mitch and the boy at the birthday party). Or when Frank dresses up as a mascot and tries to jump through a hoop of fire. Or the second-best scene in the movie, when Frank is at a party and is asked to drink from a beer bong. ""No, I promised my wife I wouldn't drink. I have a big day tomorrow."" He goes on to explain that his big day consists of going to home supply stores. ""Maybe Bed Bath & Beyond. I don't know. We may not have enough time."" After being pressured to drink, he finally gives in, and goes completely wild; he ends up stripping down and streaking across town, until his wife and her band of friends find him on the street at night, yelling and hollering, completely naked. Will Ferrell is the screen-stealer here. I've liked him since I saw him on ""Saturday Night Live"" years ago. He recently left the show to start a film career. ""Old School"" marks his first film away from ""SNL."" It is also his funniest. I like the way he talks. I remember a gag on ""SNL"" where Will played an NBC executive greenlighting a new television show called ""...And a Pizza Place."" He said, ""I see tables. Some cheese. Some pizza. I don't know, I'm not a writer."" He sounds exactly the same when he says, ""Maybe Bed Bath & Beyond. I don't know. We might not have enough time.""This could be the sign of an actor with a promising career, or an actor who people will soon find repetitive in his roles and expressions. I sure hope not, because though he sounds exactly the same as other characters on occasion, it's just his personality, just like Bill Murray was such a smart-aleck and Chevy Chase smacked his face on the floor all the time. Although, those actors lost their careers pretty much recently, so I wish Ferrell the best of luck, because he is one uproarious guy.In conclusion, ""Old School"" is a funny movie with some funny scenes, some of which are extremely hilarious. But the problem is the long stretches in between. It's got the formula. It's got the actors. It's got the cameos (Craig Kilborn, Sean William Scott), but it just fails to be consistently hilarious. I still had a fun time watching it, though, and I like these kinds of comedies once and a while. The kind that don't promise anything in particular, but give a whole lot back, whether in terms of laughter, or just ninety minutes of a big fat smile on your face. The script doesn't have to be too witty for me as long as I'm having fun, and I had a fun time watching this movie. I just hope that the sequel(s) manages to make the audience laugh on a consistent basis.",Old School

Will Ferrell is hilarious for the most part, his streaking scene really cracked me up, as he did his usual goofy stuff, and it really worked here, he really blended in with the film well, and had a cool character, I liked him a lot, and i'm not a big fan of his but he's great sometimes, and here he proved that to me!. Vince Vaughn is funny as always and did just great here, I loved his sense of humor, as he really cracked me up!. Jeremy Piven is excellent as the asshole, I hated him but he really excels at these roles here is no different. Ellen Pompeo is decent here as the love interest and did what she had to do adequately, not too hard to look at either. Juliette Lewis is usually amazing in anything, however not here because she only has one scene!, she did good in it though, and it was great to see her again! (Juliette Rules!!!!!!). Elisha Cuthbert is incredibly gorgeous!, and did very well with what she had to do, which unfortunately was not much, as i would have loved to seen more of her! (Elisha Rules!!!!!!!!!). Craig Kilborn is convincing as the cheating asshole, he did his job well. Seann William Scott is very funny in his scene but that's all he had, I wished he had more! (Scott Rules!!!!!). Leah Remini and Perrey Reeves both do what they have to do well. Rest of the cast do fine. Overall well worth the watch!. *** out of 5",Old School
24,UniqueParticle,So much fun!,9,19 September 2021,"I must say I love all of Todd Phillips films and this one is an ultimate delight! The comedy is pretty solid even if it's not the characters are all entertaining. It's mostly about a adult fraternity and wild behavior. I love Old School for what it is especially the music, the glow with many aspects, and the direction of everything. There's so many hilarious bits that are perfect I'd easily recommend it.",Old School
25,Floated2,Great comedy,7,5 October 2008,"Old School promises viewers all the fun of college and none of the education. Thanks in large part to Will Ferrell, that's exactly what they get: nonstop laughter and many memorable moments. As mid-life crisis hits them, Mitch (Luke Wilson), Frank (Will Ferrell), and Beanie (Vince Vaughn) try to put their troubles behind them and recapture their college days by starting an all-ages fraternity. Wilson's character is questionable, and yet funny in an awkward way. In the group he works very well, but alone he is uninteresting. However, Will Ferrell is a comic genius and propels the movie into greatness. Old School may not have an involving story or a lesson to teach, but it succeeds on almost every level as a free-for-all comedy. Although many people said this was really funny, I didn't quite feel that way. IMO, it could have been much funnier (maybe its because there were some deleted scenes when I watched it on TV), but altogether Old School is a great movie...Go cheCk it out! 7 out of 10",Old School

Actually it was pretty annoying and dull .The story isn't very relevant ,it is just a bad clone of ""Animal House "" Of John Landis . Many of the scenes don't have any relationship with the plot ,and all are just to show the stupidity of the characters . For example , when Will Ferrell removes all his clothes in the party when he is drunk , and many other similar things .And like many other movies of the same genre ,it is very sexist ,and the way how it portrait the women it is just repulsive . Now you can say ""it is just a movie "" , but there are some jokes that probably would offend some women .This one is pretty over-rated .Seriouslly ,it wasn't that good .",Old School

29,funkyfry,OK collegiate comedy,5,3 April 2003,"Following in a long tradition of college comedies that stretches back, believe it or not, beyond the memory of pretty much anyone living, comes this movie which has a pretty good concept but doesn't exploit the comedic or filmic possibilities enough to make it a good film.  My friend and I saw this movie at the drive-in theater in Sacramento, CA, and we were in a proper state of mind for a film of this type, so it did sustain our interest fairly well.  There were one or two really funny scenes, mostly thanks to Ferrell.  Artie Lang -- were you really in this movie?  I think you had, like, one line.There were a lot of people in this movie -- Vince Vaughn, Juliette Lewis, Craig Kilborn -- who I could really say ""what are you doing in this movie?"" I know what Artie Lang and Jeremy Piven are doing in this movie, they have nothing else to do!To be fair, Piven is a genre pro, having appeared to somewhat equal effect in a similar movie, ""P.C.U."", in which David Spade played the role he plays in ""Old School"".  Better luck next time, guys, but thanks for the memories.  fans of this genre will have to wait for next time for a really good movie.....",Old School
30,Anonymous_Maxine,"If you've always wanted to see Will Farrell naked, now's your chance.",6,5 April 2003,"The tagline of the movie, `All the fun of college, none of the education,' is surprisingly more descriptive than the usual movie tagline. The movie does manage to eek by at a higher level than it's idiotic colleagues, the American Pies and Road Trip and The New Guy, Not Another Teen Movie, etc etc etc etc etc etc etc etc. These are kinds of movies that we are flogged with more in the last five years or so than we ever have in the history of the movies, and they seem to be going downhill, as though filmmakers are conducting morbid experiments on the moral and intellectual depths of their viewing audience. While Old School certainly contains all of the ingredients of one of these experimental films, it manages to escape being yet another vicious insult to the general intelligence of moviegoers as a whole, although just barely.Vince Vaughn single-handedly saves this movie from a fate that it was almost sure to suffer. This is a tremendously talented actor who is distantly above doing movies like this (although other actors in the movie, like Farrell (and probably no one else) are hugely talented as well but are famous for this type of comedy), but who takes on the role with a smile and with the right frame of mind and who, mostly with a straight face, delivers all of the funniest lines in the movie.If you go to the home page for Old School on the IMDb, there is a message at the bottom where someone asks people what their favorite line from Old School is, and if you click on that there is a huge page of people's quotes, which just shows how packed this movie is with hilarious scenes and bits of dialogue. I'll be the first to admit that there is plenty of cheesy crap in the movie (since I tend to look for stuff like that when I watch a movie like this), but there is also a huge amount of great comedy that more than makes up for it. There are tons and tons of scenes and pieces of dialogue that are unexpected and hilarious but not unexpected in that they were just thrown in for a laugh or for shock value.And besides that, Master of Puppets was on the soundtrack! How can you POSSIBLY go wrong?? When was the last time you saw a movie that was brave enough to use a Metallica song on the soundtrack? BRAVO!!",Old School
31,jtindahouse,Just good fun,9,27 February 2009,"Old School is full of hilarious scenarios and lines. It's a film which lets you be a part of the fun because of the way the actors just seem to be having such a good time. The story doesn't flow perfectly, but this almost works to the films favor. It tends to make the craziness of some of the scenes work better, in that they come from almost nowhere.The three leads are perfectly cast. Will Ferrell plays one of his most realistic characters to date and still manages to put his unique stamp on it brilliantly. Vaughn is his usual sarcastic, bitter but likable, self. He plays it well and it works in bringing a nice touch to his films. Luke Wilson wasn't quite as likable as he usually manages to come off and this was off-putting to an extent. He doesn't cause huge laughs either but holds his own between two giants of the comedic acting world. Seann William Scott is a nice addition to the film and steals the scene in his one and only.Old School doesn't stand out from other comedies, but you get the impression it never intended to. It is simply another great chance for this fine team of filmmakers to put a different scenario out there for these talented comedians to work with. If all you're looking for is a lot of laughs then this is a film for you.",Old School

Lots of cameos and clever secondary roles or bit parts as well. Well Ferrell actually made me cry I was laughing so hard.The plot is pretty good for a comedy and follows 3 mid twenty-ish guys trying to postpone adulthood (responsibility, wives, families) in favour of recapturing the irresponsible fun of their college years by starting their own off-campus frat house.

35,aidanratesmovies,About what you would expect,9,27 August 2020,"Funny, amusing, and nostalgic- Old School may take a little while to get into gear, but once it does, it makes for quite a enjoyable ride. The film is led by comedic stars Will Ferrell, Luke Wilson, and Vince Vaughn. Many will leave the film remembering some iconic scenes with Will Ferrell's Frank in mind, but the true underdog performance here, I have to say is Vaughn, who never lets up on his comedic chops from the moment he first hits the screen, and continues through and through throughout the film entirely. Luke Wilson's character is rather basic, and Wilson doesn't have much to do with the film until later, but once he gets a bit out of the mold of his standard character, he becomes a notable enough presence on screen. The film is full of laughs, and well comedic timing. Like I said previously, it does take a while to get started and into the groove of things. It finds its footing maybe 20 or so minutes in. That isn't to say the beginning of the film is bad, rather, just the rest of the film is much stronger. It also has a handful of cliches throughout that are bound to make you roll your eyes, but luckily it takes away focus from those parts sooner than later, and proves to be much better than its flaws. In the end, Old School is an enjoyable comedy that is pretty much what you expected it to be. It will make you laugh quite a bit, and if your a fan of Ferrell and Vaughn, than it will be an evermore fulfilling experience.
My Rating: 8.75/10",Old School
36,Agent10,Raunch Supreme,7,14 March 2003,"Much like the tradition of the raunchy flicks of the 80s, Old School encompasses the age old tradition of tactless and tasteless film creation. Buy the oddity of the situation, this is one of those films I can tolerate. Mid-life malaise couldn't have been drawn better in the lives of Mitch, Frank and Beanie. Men who serve no purpose in society, especially to their significant others. But that's the significance of the frat house. No, it isn't about being drunk and hitting on 19-year-old girls, its about reaffirming your role in society and making the inner soul feel good and relaxed. So, say what you want about the random nudity and cussing, this film is a life affirming film for all men hitting their 30s.",Old School
37,rosscinema,Animal House this isn't!,5,20 April 2004,"I'm entertained by juvenile gross-out comedies as much as the next guy but the story here is so familiar that I actually started to roll my eyes. Story is about Mitch Martin (Luke Wilson) who is in his early 30's and one night he catches his girlfriend Heidi (Juliette Lewis) having orgies. He moves out and lives in a house near the University and when his best friend Bernard (Vince Vaughn) finds out he convinces him to start a fraternity so that they can party every night and meet girls. They throw a wild party one night and Mitch's buddy Frank (Will Ferrell) gets wasted and goes streaking but is caught by his wife who throws him out of the house. Frank ends up living with Mitch and the three of them quickly become legends on campus.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Mitch is infatuated with Nicole (Ellen Pompeo) but she has an obnoxious boyfriend Mark (Craig Kilborn) who constantly flirts with other women. The head of the university Dean Pritchard (Jeremy Piven) will stop at nothing to get them out of the house and finally challenges their fraternity to a bevy of tests. This film is directed by Todd Phillips who is slowly becoming one of the better comedic directors around and one has to figure that he was influenced by films such as ""Animal House"" and ""Bachelor Party"" but that's where the similarity ends. The story for this film is so familiar that it comes across as very tired and there was never any real flow or rhythm to the way it was presented. Scenes just seem to bump into each other and this film is really not edited well at all. Also, the abundance of cliche's hurts the story as well and how can you have a college comedy without the obligatory nasty Dean trying to spoil their fun? And of course Pompeo's boyfriend is a jerk, how else is the star of the film suppose to get her? When the film finally ends their really isn't any wrap-up to what you have just watched and I'm not sure Wilson even gets the girl. The film just kind of ends and everyone seemingly just moves on. Did I miss something? The only reason I didn't rate this lower is because of the talent of Ferrell who is genuinely funny in certain scenes and Andy Dick pops up in an amusing cameo but these scenes seem few and far between. Phillips is a talented director and I believe he's still learning but he has a way to go before he becomes the next John Landis or Neal Israel.",Old School
38,RainDogJr,"""You forgot your birthday, didn't you?""; This party is overrated",5,16 June 2009,"Todd Phillips' most recent movie, The Hangover, has been getting really positive reviews (Roger Ebert gave it ***1/2), is already for the IMDb users one of the top 250 movies of all time and well for me it looks quite attractive (liked a lot the stuff with Mike Tyson from the trailer) and thankfully it will be released in my country just some months after its release in the US (not sure but I think it's coming in August). So I will be seeing The Hangover on the big screen, meanwhile I decided to give a shot to this Todd Phillip movie, the 2003 Old School. I always see the Old School R4 DVD on offer, I liked the other two movies from Todd I saw before (I have desires to re-watch Starsky & Hutch and I hope it is still really good for me and School for Scoundrels was a good if not special entertainment) and it has Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell starring so yes, it was about time to check this movie, I bought its cheap DVD and saw it just todayOld School is never hilarious, quite a disappointing (and overrated – it has 7.0 in the IMDb user rating) party. Wilson, Vaughn and Ferrell stars as Mitch, Bernard and Frank the tank respectively, the first of them just discovered his girlfriend (sexy Juliette Lewis) in the middle of not her very first orgy, Frank the tank just got married and Bernard, well he has already a family. These three will be partying as soon as the silliest stuff begins, I mean as soon as Mitch gets a new place rapper Snoop Dog will be there, the tank will be running naked through the neighborhood, etc. Both Ferrell and Vaughn have some funny bits (as the movies goes on Vaughn's funny stuff is less and less) but there's nothing really memorable about the fraternity, and in consequence the fraternity vs. the dean stuff doesn't delivers a damn memorable thing. So I saw Old School and I can say it is not something I would like to see again, still Sean William Scott has a cool look as Peppers.",Old School

42,baumer,Animal House for adults,9,18 April 2007,"Old School is cut from the same cloth as film like Animal House and Porky's. It's unapologetic, raunchy, hilarious and made for guys. My wife just doesn't get it. She doesn't see the humour in the film. but every guy I have spoken to about the film can relate to it, and they love it. The movie speaks to men who perhaps are married and sometimes yearn for the younger days when they had little responsibility and could go through life in a daze of a hangover. Will Ferrel, Vince Vaughn and Luke Wilson are those guys.Will Ferrel again plays the funniest of the three characters and although he is played for laughs, he might also be the most relatable character. There is one exchange between him and some frat boys at a college campus party that many of us married men can relate to. Just before some of the rowdy boys are going to chug their beer, they ask Frank The Tank to participate. He replies that he can't because he has a big day the next day. He is going to Home Depot to pick out some paint and some blinds for the living room. The guys just look at him and laugh. In a movie like American Beauty, this could have been played for a serious look at men yearning for their younger days and missing out on life as it gets too serious. But in Old School, it is played for yuks. Frank the Tank begins funneling the beer and soon he is streaking on the streets of his hometown. This is very reminiscent of the scene in Porky's where PeeWee is running down the county road and pulled over by the local police.Another funny and poignant scene in the film is where Frank and his wife are in marriage counseling and the shrink tells Frank he is in a happy place and nothing can hurt him here and he can say anything. Anything? Frank replies? Anything, the counselor replies. What ensues is something Ron Burgundy would say:Anything? Well, uh I guess I, deep down, am feeling a little confused. I mean, suddenly, you get married, and you're supposed to be this entirely different guy. I don't feel different. I mean, take yesterday for example. We were out at the Olive Garden for dinner, which was lovely. And uh, I happen to look over at a certain point during the meal and see a waitress taking an order, and I found myself wondering what color her underpants might be. Her panties. Uh, odds are they are probably basic white, cotton, underpants. But I sort of think well maybe they're silk panties, maybe it's a thong. Maybe it's something really cool that I don't even know about. You know, and uh, and I started feeling... what? what I thought we were in the trust tree in the nest, were we not?This scene is painfully honest, and honestly painful, because it rings so true.I read on IMDb that this was actually an homage to Fight Club. The first rule of the fraternity is that you don't talk about the fraternity. The second rule of the fraternity is that you don't talk about the fraternity. There is even a scene where Blue is about to wrestle the two naked women, where Mitch is dressed like Brad Pitt from Fight Club. It's kind of funny to look for some of the similarities.Old School is one of the funniest films of our generation. The situations the three men go through are painful in some ways, but they are played for pure comedy. Vince Vaughn scores another winning and classic performance here as Beanie, the rich playboy of the bunch who likes to spend his money on extravagant things like hiring Snoop Dog to play at his party, and buying hundreds of packages of KJ jelly so that one of his fraternity members can wrestle in it with some hot college girls. He might as well be Joe Francis of Girls Gone Wild fame. Also making a cameo appearance is Elisha Cuthbert who plays a highschool girl that ""befriends"" Mitch. And she very nice to look at in the film.Old School is raunchy and unapologetic. It has a keen ear for detail and this may have been the film that proved to the studios that Ferrel could carry a movie on his own. He really is hilarious in Old School.This is a 9/10 and one of the funniest films of the decade. It will go on to be a classic.9/10",Old School

44,blott2319-1,Awful people behaving awfully...what a laugh!,2,11 August 2021,"Being faced with watching Old School, I was of two minds. On the one hand, I utterly despise movies where grown men act extremely immature. However, the one exception to that rule has almost always been Will Ferrell. He has an ability to bring a childlike innocence that I find hilarious when juxtaposed with his massive physical presence. But this wasn't that magical mix. Instead of acting innocent, he just acts like a drunk loser. Of course that makes him fit in with the rest of the cast of this film. Everyone is celebrating the disgusting frat boy lifestyle as if it is something to aspire to for some reason. The humor is found in grown men crapping on life's responsibilities and living it up as if their existence is only enjoyable if they're drunk and stupid. That seems to be the lesson of this film, because they constantly expect us to root for the alcoholic rapists.Oh, did I forget to mention that little chestnut? Yeah, the ""likable"" protagonist of Old School basically starts things off by committing statutory rape while in a drunken stupor. Isn't that funny!! The characters are all despicable and unpleasant, but we're constantly expected to laugh at it all. I am willing to admit, there were a couple scenes where I genuinely laughed, and most of it was when WIll Ferrell was being his own goofy self. Those few moments were the only bright spot in an otherwise dismal film. Old School is just a series of scenes that feel like they were brainstormed in a lousy SNL writer's room, and they compiled the sketches into a movie. Even when I thought the plot was going to take a smart turn and change from what you'd expect, it still ends up devolving into more lame humor about sex and drugs. Comedy is subjective to the extreme, so I will try not to judge those who love this movie, but it kind of made me sick to my stomach.",Old School
45,Beta_Gallinger,"It seems the more I see this, the less I like it",5,16 March 2008,"I have now seen this film three times. The first time I saw it was in 2005, and I know that was a good first viewing, even though I later realized I could barely remember any of it! The second time I saw it, I could remember a bit more in the end (not that much more, mind you), even though I didn't find it quite as amusing this time. Finally, I just watched it for the third time last night, and I think that was also my last time. I think I can remember most of it now (some parts still didn't ring any bells the third time, even though I had seen them twice before!), but overall, I didn't find it too amusing this time, so what good is that?Mitch Martin, Frank Ricard, and Bernard ""Beanie"" Campbell are three friends, all currently in their thirties, who are not currently having the best of luck. One night, when Mitch comes home from work, he finds out his girlfriend, Heidi, is playing a sex game with another couple, and that's the end of their relationship. Shortly after this incident, Frank gets married, but giving up his partying lifestyle will not be easy. Beanie has been married for a while now, and has kids of his own, but longs for his old partying lifestyle. Mitch has moved into a house on a local university campus, and the three friends start a fraternity there to relive their past! Many people join them, including students, as well as others of different ages, the oldest one 89. However, Gordon Pritchard, whom Mitch, Frank, and Beanie knew in their childhood and liked to pull pranks on, is now the dean of this university! Still holding a grudge against them, he plans to shut down this fraternity of theirs! Two scenes I COULD remember from my first viewing of ""Old School"" are Frank (played by polarizing comedian Will Ferrell) enthusiastically running naked down the street, and one of the fraternity members (a student) being accidentally pulled off a bridge when the brick attached to his genitals with a rope falls down a sewer hole. From what I remember, I found both of these gags highly amusing the first time I saw them. However, the last time I watched the film, I found the former only mildly amusing, and thought the latter was pretty lame. I don't know exactly why I found that one so funny in the first place! Some parts definitely did make me laugh during my latest viewing, some probably slightly more so than the public nudity scene. However, I didn't find most of the film too amusing, found a lot of it boring, and definitely found more than one lame joke. In fact, I think the scene where Frank walks around with a bullet in his neck before falling into the pool was just a tad disturbing to me! The first time I watched this movie, I knew it was pretty silly, but that's not always a bad thing. (I like ""Dumb & Dumber"".) However, the last time I saw it, it DID seem like a bad thing. Maybe it's because I now have higher standards than I did back when I first watched it, or it's a film that wears thin with later viewings. Maybe it's a combination of the two. Well, whatever it is, it's clear that I don't care much for ""Old School"" anymore. Like I said, I could barely remember the film after seeing it once, and I assure you, I was sober at the time. I don't take any illegal drugs and don't usually drink. I think this proves that it's certainly not the most memorable comedy ever made. This 2003 comedy could be amusing if you like extremely silly, crude humour, the kind that appeals MOSTLY to guys (like me), this might be worth checking out, but I highly doubt it will be widely remembered as a classic decades from now.",Old School
46,Stampsfightclub,"Different, but not funny or deep enough",7,13 April 2008,"Renowned comedy actors Will Ferrell (Blades of Glory) Luke Wilson (Blue Streak) and Vince Vaughn (Wedding Crashers) star in this comedy drama about a couple of middle aged men trying to recapture their college days.When reading the back of the DVD I thought I knew what would happen and knew the kind of genre but I was wrong.Though the film follows many conventions such as love, embarrassing situations, stereotypes and a basic plot, there were still many surprises in stall to make it an interesting watch.As in most comedies, the central character has to overcome various obstacles to find himself. Wilson's character Mitch is struggling with relationships after coming home to find his girlfriend caught up in a bizarre sex situation. On moving out he starts to realize how hard life is being single. With an ounce of predictability, this storyline is slow moving, focusing on the character, which was good enough but the situations could have been stronger and longer to give the character more depth.Vince Vaughn's character is very annoying and selfish and is frustrating to watch at points. Ferrell's character is good to watch as he is the funniest out of the free, especially the streak scene.With a strong focus upon sex, there are a few humorous moments involving carrots, streaking, dolls and naked wrestling this film is focused towards an older more mature audience.The plot is average.

So what they do is start a fraternity at the local college, and use Mitch's new house as headquarters. They have many pledges, some from the college, and some are just guys wanting to have fun. The fraternity starts out well, but is compromised by the dean, an old rival of the trios from when they were younger.The dean, Pritchard (played by Jeremy Piven), gives the boys an ultimatum. They must take a test to see whether their frat house is able to stay or go. In the meanwhile, one of their pledges dies in a KY wrestling match. Because of that unfortunate event, they do not receive the percentile they need to stay.A scandal erupts! Dean Pritchard, it turns out, has bribed the student government president to revoke the fraternity's status. In the end though, good prevails and Dean Pritchard is fired. The trio find a new location at Dean Pritchard's former residence.A great film.

It was incredibly labored and seemed to affectionately long for frat days, which just seemed violent and stupid. I can't say I hated this movie because for that I'd have to actually have cared one way or the other about it. it was just dumb (and not in a good way like dumb and dumber) and ultimately a boring waste of a couple of good hours.

53,movieguy1021,Old School: 3/10,3,9 February 2003,"Haven't we seen this all before? Old School, from the director of Road Trip, is basically Animal House for the new generation. Except for the fact that Old School is very rarely funny, and is basically just stupid, with idiotic sex jokes thrown in.The plot is nothing, there's no reason to throw it in. Mitch (Luke Wilson) just broke up with his girlfriend, so he starts an off-campus fraternity. It's a throwaway plot, just like the rest of the movie. There is not one redeeming quality of this picture. If it was a mindless comedy that was FUNNY, I might be able to give it some slack. But a mindless motion picture comedy that isn't funny, I just feel sorry for. The whole theater was cracking up. I was about the only one with a stone face.This type of broad comedy I can usually handle, but I couldn't when watching Old School. It has basically zero laughs and minor characters that we don't know about! It's a mean-spirited fest that is just horrible. The supporting characters, such as the people in the fraternity, have zero depth and nothing that makes us care about them. Plus, there were some fat jokes I didn't think were funny. If you think that people with a cinder block tied around their genetalia is funny, you should see Old School. Everyone else, if you are dragged, at least you can witness a humorous (not funny, humorous) parody of The Graduate.Wilson, who, along with his brother Owen, I like a lot, was OK, but it isn't his fault that he got stuck with such a stupid movie. I'm not really sure how many times I can reiterate that this movie was horrible.

He's got the nice guy routine down pat but it must be kind of stifling. Will Ferrell gets to go completely insane but you don't mind it as much because it is counterbalanced by the fact that he is basically playing a more realistic person and not some sort of parody like he did in Anchorman.Vince Vaugn is actually why you should at least look at this as a quite successful comedy. He gets to play all variables, the motor-mouth, the guy who says the most inappropriate things and ultimately the brains of the outfit. Like him or not, he does make an impression.The movie in itself is pretty tame, as I thought that it would be a tribute to all things apolitically correct. The first half hour is hilarious but it gets a little watered down by the end, where you get the obligatory underdog vs. evil plot that is as old as the frat movie itself. There is surprisingly little explicit sexual situations in the movie as well, although a sequence with Andy Dick, some women and root vegetables almost made me wanna say: Oh, come on!

60,willcundallreview,An OK comedy near being kind of good,6,9 April 2014,"Rating-6/10Old school is a funny movie with a funny cast, maybe not the funniest movie ever but with a nice plot and a film that doesn't have to make you laugh to be good, this is worth a watch. I did think maybe I overrated this at first but the film is actually pretty good with some nice jokes added into an ever revealing storyline, and with some physical comedy actors to go, this is film has quality. I felt the film was Solidly OK and here below is why I felt that about it all.The story is a college fraternity type film, and you may be thinking "" we have had this all before"" ,but this has a twist, the main characters aren't college students, they have jobs, families and they never get to party, well until now. The pacing is good, the movie not too long and the although the jokes aren't a plenty and takes along time for the first funny thing to be said, it still manages to be kind of funny by the end. The story end's in a smart way as well with hints of more high school films coming in but it still remains the working dad's and there house.Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn are the main guys in this and without them I would have rated this poor, although none of them are at comedy best, they still manage to churn out a respectfully funny performance. I did enjoy there support too and the characters that hang around there house are all fun guys, I didn't quite appreciate the acting of the Dean Jeremy Piven, but he doesn't ruin it too much at all.Todd Phillips in a sense runs the whole thing and contributes to the script but also directs, and I felt without the firm direction of Phillips, the film would suffer more so hats off to his contribution to the film. Some funny stunts they do can be hilarious and make you genuinely chuckle, one such part is at Vince Vaughn's sons birthday party when Ferrell(MAYBE A SPOILER HERE FOR SOME) get's well, darted by a zoo keeper and I won't ruin the sequence but it made me laugh more than at any other time in the movie.The film's main bad point is that it isn't all THAT funny and jokes do occasionally miss the mark badly, it doesn't make this film bad at all but contributes to it's lower mark. I also felt maybe the characters could have put more back into it as although they are funny, people such as Ferrell should be much more funny and do a lot more of what we have seen before of him. Finally the script isn't all so solid but I won't mention too much about it because that would just drag it right down, which is doesn't deserve.I think those into these kind of early 2000's college comedies should enjoy and although it is a different type crudeness wise to things like American Pie and such (mainly because they main characters are mature adults), it may not please everyone, but should overall. Same again for people who shouldn't watch, the film isn't afraid of being itself and letting it's hormones go so if you dislike crude, better stay away.Overall I give it a 6/10 meaning it is Solidly a OK movie but offers very little more than this, my rating is stretching it to it's highest point, maybe I felt nice on the day. If you a teen watch it because it has all the hallmarks of teen moves today, but another thing is if you were a teen or in college in the early 2000's, it should be a massive nostalgic trip back to them day's, oh and might make you laugh.",Old School
61,Coffee_in_the_Clink,"Very flat, at times funny, but overall an uninspired comedy",4,29 March 2020,"Arriving home early from a business trip, Mitch (Luke Wilson) walks in on his partner in the middle of an orgy. When she admits to regularly taking part in them and that their relationship is practically nulled, he breaks up with her and moves upstate, renting a house near a university campus. His two best friends, newlywed Frank (Will Ferrell) and bored, dad-of-one retail-manager Bernard (Vince Vaughan) land at his doorstep and throw a house-warming party, inviting all the students on campus, giving the impression that Mitch's home is the new frat-house on the block. The first party is a success and Mitch blows off a little steam, but when word gets around campus of what a great night it was, and Frank goes on a temporary break from his wife and ends up living with Mitch, and Bernard hatches a scheme to relieve his college days, the party is just beginning.Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughan are two comedy heavyweights and they are fairly good here, and lend some credit to a script that is uninspired and just does not live up to the potential that its premise, and pedigree of cast, has. The frat-house initiation scenes are very funny and the cast of misfits who aspire to be members are entertaining. Look out for a very Simon Helberg (Big Bang Theory's Howard Wolowitz) in the crew. This film has garnered something of a cult following over the years, owing to the cast, but honestly I wouldn't give it the time or day.

Yet bizarrely Hollywood, year after year seems to think the rest of the world has an interest in either the American Police force, or in this case the Amercian College system. We don't.Luke Wilson's character made little, if any sense at all, his potential romance added nothing, Vince Vaughan is a great actor but to put it bluntly - isn't funny and hampered by starring in some of the most painfully lame films imaginable and Ferrell appears to also have some talent but no scripts that come close to reflecting it - one or two mildly amusing scenes here, when drunk but his character seemed completely lost & still in the first draft. The rest of the cast had such minimal air-time they were doing nothing more than making up the numbers.This is marginally funnier than the likes of Dodgeball & Anchorman (which really isn't saying that much) as there are one or two scenes that ... I wouldn't go as far as make you laugh or even smile, but at least make your lip twitch slightly.The plot (if you can call it that) moves fairly quickly at the beginning and what with the ridiculous & amateurish tangents it goes off at, it's pointless thinking to yourself ""why is this happening"" or ""how did we end up here.""

67,Mr_Censored,Old School Will,7,30 December 2008,"""Old School"" is a 2003 comedy from writer/director Todd Phillips (""Road Trip"") about a group of middle-aged men who open their own fraternity in hopes of reconnecting with their youth, via copious amounts of booze and girls. It's got a cast that, today, reads like a ""Who's Who"" of the so-called frat-pack. Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn, namely, re-invent their respective careers by appearing in this movie. Andy Dick shows that he has even less self-respect that we could have ever imagined, but is gut-bustingly hilarious, never-the-less. About a year prior to fading away, Seann William-Scott has a brief role as a pony-wrangler, giving way to one of the most memorable scenes of the movie. Leah Remini actually does something besides ""King Of Queens"". And Elisha Cuthbert looks really nice in boy-cut underwear.But no one in this film can match the intensity or the sheer hilarity of Will Ferrell. To say the character of Frank -- ""The Tank"" -- stole the show would be an understatement. Ferrell single-handedly makes the movie worthwhile. Before you could count on him to churn out film after film -- all varying in quality -- every few months, he was still just that guy from ""Saturday Night Live"" who was relegated to peripheral character status in movies such as ""Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery"" and ""The Ladies Man"". That all changed when he stepped into the role of Frank ""The Tank"" and made ""Old School"" the hit it was, and the millennial comedic milestone it is today. It's no coincidence, then, that the film just drags without him. Each scene that is missing him, makes you miss him. Really, everyone is playing themselves, but Ferrell is the only one who seems to be willing to go to the limits to deliver. And the great thing about his kind of humor is that it isn't polarizing. no matter who you are, it's hard not to at least snicker a bit at his rambling or antics. His out-of-control boozing, therapy-session outbursts, drug-induced hallucinations and knack for streaking account for 99.99% of the humor in ""Old School"". What could have been just another throwaway, ""Animal House"" rip-off, college film, is elevated to classic status thanks to this one character and the actor portraying him. If you want to see Will Ferrell in his prime, where he really started gaining momentum, this is the place to start. I suppose since this is a review of ""Old School"", I should go a bit more in-depth about the movie itself. But why bother? I already told you about the best part.",Old School

Maybe it could have had more party scenes, since it was a movie about a high school fraternity made by 3 grown men after all, but nonetheless the movie is a great watch if you like Will Ferell and comedies in general.

He is the loudest talker in the movie Old School, an ""Animal House for our generation"" type movie that is mildly amusing, but not as funny as it maybe could have been. Maybe because Ferrell is so over the top, the lower key performers I found funnier, such as I found Luke Wilson's character to be the funniest and Vince Vaughn does another solid job. The movie revolves around Luke Wilson being evicted from his home because it is on the local college's campus' property. His friends (Vaughn and Ferrell) get the idea to turn his house into a fraternity, allowing Wilson's character to stay. The rest of the film is a look at how grown men relive their college days and how, I guess, you too can go back to your college days where you streak through the streets or watch jello wrestling. The film is what it is. Nothing profound, and at only 91 minutes, it knows when to end. It is funny at times, though I didn't find Ferrell to be as funny as I remembered him on Saturday Night Live.

The story is easy to follow, simple, and full of funny jokes and hilarious gags. I thought this film was genuinely funny and I truly enjoyed it. The characters are all funny and are all likeable.The acting is very good. Luke Wilson is by far the best. He is a likeable, funny, and good-hearted man looking for a fresh start. Vince Vaughn is also hilarious. 
His one-liners are always well timed. Will Ferrell plays a weird and sometime socially awkward man who at times can be very funny. I found his character to be the weakest and at times he was really annoying. Jeremy Piven's character is not well developed and very, very annoying.The pacing is a little slow and the runtime is overlong.Pros: Hilarious story, good jokes, Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn are both hilarious, and most the characters are likeableCons: Some slow pacing, an overlong runtime, Jeremy Piven and his bad performance, and Will Ferrell's character is a little annoyingOverall Rating: 7.0",Old School

It was a elam (you can unscramble the letters - and no, it isn't male or meal) attempt at a carbon copy of the classic Animal House.The amazing thing to me is just how subjective comedy is. I like situation comedy like Married With Children, but I don't like slapstick - too simplistic - and a lot of this movie was just that. The pie in the face idea is so old and worn out. I guess I just want to be surprised by intelligent wit and humor rather than just bombarded with physical gags.Not surprisingly, IMBD shows the older you are, the less likely you are to rate this movie highly. What is surprising to me is that the group that I watched this movie with was largely 30-50 years old and they seemed to laugh their asses off. I just don't get it.

I had a hard time figuring all what was the point of this, 4 guys trying to go back to the college life... sounded like the right idea for a comedy, but it doesnt work at all.  the only humorous part that i like (**SPOILER**) was when will gets drunk and wants to lead the streaking, and then the wife is driving past with her friends when will is running around naked screaming!  that was funny, the rest is not.  luke wilson, what were you thinking?  you are comedy material, just check the 70's show work you did and the legally blonde movies.  he was trying to get into the gross teen movie screens, like american pie and scary movies. that isnt your sort of funny, the legally blonde ideas were your ticket, and you could probably make this movie go away with a thriller or an another comedy, but not as bad as this.  will, stay with the roles in which you are somewhat close to your age.

He has a way of stealing every scene that he is in, and this movie is no different. Together with mr ""i talk all the time"" Vince Vaughn and ""i look insecure no matter what"" Luke Wilson they are a very good comedic gang. I watched the unrated edition on dvd and of course they have tried to put as many pairs of breasts they can get away with :) But this is a simple and funny movie. Will Ferrel goes streaking through the city, Sean William Scott does a small role as an abusive animal trainer and Snoop does a cameo. All in all i think people will enjoy this movie. Although it is not exceptionally good, it is good enough to have a few laughs and enjoy yourself. I rate this movie 7/10",Old School

It's the breakthrough movie of the comedy legend Will Ferrell; wasn't his best but undoubtedly one of his outrageous roles. I don't know why I haven't watched this one until now the reason seems to be beyond me. I thought that Luke Wilson was the most off-putting character here but that's what his role is meant to seem. So, the movie is about grown guys who decided to put off responsibility by reliving old college days it is not consistently funny but amusing most of the time. I like the fantastic cast they had the best chemistry, each and every oe of them played his role brilliantly. Will Ferrell definitely the funniest with his off-the-wall personality.

Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, and Vince Vaugn are buddies that decide to open their own fraternity...in this one you don't have to be a student to be a member. There are a lot of predictable comedic moments and a fair amount of nudity (a bit more than most would probably want).

83,stevetseitz,Parts of this movie are laugh-out-loud funny,7,12 March 2003,"There are certain scenes in this film where Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn were so funny that I was surprised that I didn't enjoy the movie more. Luke Wilson is the a straight man to Ferrell's abominable frat guy routine and Vaughn's incessant wise-cracking, but Wilson tends to rely on the ""slightly stunned"" look in this film more than actually emote. Not unlike ""The Sweetest Thing"", ""Old School"" was uneven in tone. That must be the hardest thing about doing comedy. You must strive to keep the tone the same throughout the whole film to be truly successful. At times in the movie issues of getting older, marriage, domestication, and infidelity were treated  quasi-seriously, the closest comparison was ""Peter's Friends"" and then suddenly we drop back into the ""Animal House"" level or worse the ""Revenge of the Nerds"" level. To really let your audience laugh you must be specific and consistent in your own sensibility of what's funny. Too many cooks spoil the soup. I wished the film had skipped the higher aspirations altogether and stayed above the ""Revenge of the Nerds"" level. The funniest parts of the film were not intentionally written. The humor was derived from Will Ferrell's and Vince Vaughn's reactions to the scenes.",Old School
84,MovieLuvaMatt,"Could've been funnier, but still a good comedy",7,7 August 2003,"Another ""Animal-House-type"" guy comedy filled with guy humor.  Does it work? For the most part.  There were moments where I felt like I was forcing myself to laugh to prevent myself from feeling cheated, but there are some genuinely funny moments.  Will Ferrell is almost always funny, being one of the greatest recent SNL alums.  For some reason, there's something about Vince Vaughn that always cracks me up--when he does comedy, of course.  In ""Swingers"" he steals every scene with his hilarious portrayal of Trent, and does the same in this movie.  It's funny to see Jeremy Piven playing a dorky dean, playing against type, since he'd usually be cast as one of the party animals.  Todd Phillips also directed ""Road Trip,"" and though this isn't as funny as that previous effort, it works.  And he was able to fit in the obligatory boob shot, during the KY wrestling scene.  I actually felt like this film was too short.  It should've at least ended with a final party scene, instead of fading to black leaving you with a ""That's it"" feeling.

Characters are mostly boring, the story is downright stupid, absolutely unbelievable, cheesy and predictable. I almost felt insulted by the stupidity of the movie. Everything is totally constructed, like, the 08/15 happy end and the obligatory love story. And not only is the story stupid, it also is absolutely uninteresting. It bored the hell out of me. The reason why I managed to watch the movie till the cheesy end, has been the decent humor, and the good cast. But my god, 7.0 points! - I don't get how this has been possible.

88,boondocksaint20,"Surprisingly, disapointing...",3,17 June 2003,"First, I want to say that even though I appreciate all forms of cinema, I have always had a soft spot for comedies.  Some are good movies AND are hysterical, like Office Space for instance.  Some are lame but genuinely funny because they are silly, and still are fun because if we can lighten up, we can laugh our butts off.  And some are just completely lame, make no sense and have few if any redeeming qualities.  Old School, to my greatest disapointment, falls smack dab into the LAME category.Now, I'm a college student, and to further my 'credibility', I love the silliest of movies like Deuce Bigalow, Van Wilder, Kingpin, Porky's...etc, b\c to me, though I can acknowledge that they aren't 'oscar caliber' that isn't what I watched them for...I watched them to laugh, and when I want to laugh at a good movie, I am usually laid back enough to enjoy them, and appreciate the comedy, no matter how sick/juvenile, and enjoy being in stitches.  The comedies I find good all have redeeming qualities and are hilarious in their own right...but when I really think about it, most of them also had 'purposes' too.  What I mean by that is, though they are not why we are watching them, the fact that they have plots, and have some type of moral or triumph in the end makes them not only worthwhile, but also satisfying. If they didn't have them, then all I'd need is to watch a movie that was nothing but scene after scene of sketch comedy for the same effect.Old School looked so funny from the trailers, plus it has Will Ferrell in it...streaking!  That right there sold me, I think he is one of the funniest guys out there right now, and since I love movies with the Animal House spirit, I decided to give this one a shot.  I can't believe how disapointed I was towards the end.I will say that there are about 3 or 4 good laughs, mainly around the beginning, 1 of which had me rolling on the floor, and maybe a couple more chuckles here and there...but I was shocked at how boring this film was in between.  Not that plot really matters that much in a movie like this, but this film didn't have one, and it's attempt at one was not convincing nor did it make any sense.  So these guys create a frat for any age with no school, but all of the parties...great idea.  But, for a movie about partying and whatnot, after the 'Mitchapalooza' that went on during the first 20 min, there was a severe lack of 'partyage' going on.  Sure, we see a scene here and there of partying, mischief or hazing of pledges, but unlike Animal House, Van Wilder, or even American Pie, there is absolutely no feeling of camaraderie shown between the cast, nor does the script allow us to really feel for the characters or their situation.  We see all of these random supporting actors who play pledges to the fraternity, but not one of them is developed so we frankly don't care about anyone.  I'm being completely honest here, I wanted to laugh when I saw this one...I ended up trying so hard to chuckle at the slightest things...but the last half of the movie seriously DRAGS.  Me, and everyone I saw it with agreed, even the person who spent the money to rent it, who was more excited to see it than anyone else fell asleep during it.  And this comes as a shock too, I usually love movies like these...I think this is the first time I have ever ripped on a college movie, but I just can't help it with this one...it is way too lame for its own good.  The actors have no chemistry together, and utterly go nowhere with the script.  It also has way too many sappy subplots that seriously get in the way of the comedy, and in the end, amount to nothing, because like I said, Vaughn, nor Ferrell, nor Wilson, though all great actors/comedians, really did not do anything on the screen to evoke any empathy for the audience.  Now, I loved Will Ferrell's scenes where he is 'Frank the Tank', chasing down beer bongs and screaming his head off at pledges, but after a while, those scenes got old, especially after seeing that this was the best the movie could come up with.
Anyways, this is waaayyyy too long of an analysis over a movie like this, so I will sum it all up like this.  This movie had so much potential, and because of that, it makes everything negative about it suck even more. Sure, there are a few pretty funny parts here and there, and they will make you laugh out loud, but they are so few and far between that I cannot give this movie any type of good review.  This is, to the record, the first college movie that I have seen, even with the aid of about 10 beers, that instead of finding as another comic gem, I found it to be...rather...boring. I'm not talking mandatory sappy plot segments that are needed to make a 'plot' for this type of movie, I'm talking joke after joke that doesn't work, promising setups with punchlines that fail to deliver, and of course, periods of total, complete boredom...in 10 minute intervals at least, where absolutely nothing funny happens.  But then again, before I had seen it, I had heard of friends say that their friends loved this movie, so I guess to each their own.  I give it 4/10 stars.",Old School

Unless you're a college administrator, in which case you may feel the need to hide any indication that you are before the lights come back on.So how does it compare to classic college frat movies?  The best I can remember (yes, including Animal House), possibly the best.  As comic and cartoonish as it is, it simply is closer to the truth than most.  Except for the Snoop Dogg house concert.Will and Vince carry the movie with their acting, and Juliette Lewis does a great job with her roll as well.  Then there is Andy Dick, but I'm not sure how much acting was really required.  The casting person deserves a lot of credit for picking the right people.Finally, the soundtrack is extremely fitting.

They can rip off (or pay homage to) the original all they want, but they just can't recapture the spirit. Animal House worked because it was fresh and new, but this movie, made 25 years (and countless other college/party animal movies) later, just reeks of staleness and recycled ideas. In addition to swiping the central plot from ""Animal House"" (uptight Dean resorts to dirty tricks to drive wild fraternity off campus), it also borrows shamelessly from ""Revenge of the Nerds"", ""Back to School"", and a ton of other movies, such that there's barely a single scene that isn't borrowed in some form from an earlier movie. Take, for example, Will Ferrell shooting himself with a tranquilizer dart, which is similar to a scene where he is shot in the butt with a tranquilizer by a monkey in ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"". It was, to put it bluntly, a lot funnier the first time around. And that applies to pretty much the entire movie.

His character was the driving force behind the movie.  I think Leah Remini is just wonderful and wish she had more opportunity to break out of the hard-nosed 'wifey' character that she has been typecast into.Not exactly a deep plot, but great slapstick, irreverent, and very funny.

Boy oh boy, after watching that film, I felt like I made a pretty bad mistake.What OLD SCHOOL is about is that it's about three guys named Mitch (Luke Wilson), Frank (Will Ferell) and Beanie (Vince Vaughn) who are now living their normal adult lives decide to re-live college days by forming a fraternity filled with various people including friends, college students, lowlifes, middle-aged men and old retirees. However, Dean (Jeremy Piven) holds a strong personal grudge against Mitch, Frank and Beanie and their fraternity that they had created.OLD SCHOOL could've been a rather funny and enjoyable film with a fine casting about a group of adults forming a fraternity, especially if it's got Will Ferrel in it, but unfortunately, it failed.

He breaks up with her and moves in a bachelor pad near a campus.  His friends throw him a party.  There is even a cameo with Snoop Dog.  Mitch's friend, Frank 'The Tank', played by Will Ferrel, gets kicked out of his house for getting busted by his wife running the streets naked. Frank ends up moving in with Mitch.It starts getting formulaic when the evil Dean gets the house for campus use.  Mitch is told he has to vacate the house.  His friends find a loophole and decide to start a fraternity to keep the house.  The rest of the movie is spent trying to keep the house from getting taken, and YAWN it's too bad. It would have been better if the movie was just about a bunch of 30 year olds getting a house and partying.  But it turned into an Animal House rip-off.

Their energy permeates the movie.  From their delivery to body language to timing, all three are on target.  The supporting cast of unusual characters adds to the joy.My favorite is Vaughn.  Though the movie revolves around Wilson's character, Vaughn is the glue that keeps it all together.  Leah Remini has a too brief turn as Vaughn's wife and steals her few scenes.  Jeremy Piven is a wonderfully hateful Dean.Lewis' character was the only weak point.

First off Will Ferrell steals every scene he is in and pushed this movie from very good to great. The comedy ranges from outrageous to (rarely) subtle. The wedding singer is an example of the simple, subtle, but genius comedic moments. Why is it so funny and why hasn't somebody thought of it before? As for the big laughs there are too many to mention from the bosses daughter, to the streaking scene, the tranquilizer scene etc etc etc. The three main cast members (Vaughn, Ferrell, and L.Wilson) make a great team each bringing their own different comedic style to their respective roles. Lets be honest every 30 something male wishes he could live in this ""fraternity"" and relive wild days gone by if only for a brief time. If this movie doesn't make you laugh at least a few times you may be dead, and if you're not dead there's a good chance your cheeks could hurt from laughing and smiling for an hour and a half. My only complaint is that Jeremy Piven is a great comedic actor and misused as the dean who wants the frat shut down.

In main characters, you've got the typical 'nice' guy who actually thinks and cares. We have the party guy, who likes to have a lot of fun but now has a family which has sobered him up a bit. We have the somewhat retarded guy who's responsible for most of the 'funny'. The only thing different about the movie compared to other teen movies are the main characters as they're not teens, but fully grown adults. For the bad guy, we have the nerd who, for lack of a better word, is a complete a**hole. Sound familiar? As for the content of the movie, here's what we have. Partying, pointless nudity, swearing, sexual references, pseudo-drama, more partying, dumb antics and 'intense' moments (e.g a really fat kid trying to pass a gym test). I don't particularly have a problem with any of these but the cold, hard truth is that they're NOT funny at all. There isn't any kind of brains applied to the humour and the way it's presented is very typical and watered down. Random nude chicks, ha ha, hilarious. Guy hit with tranquilizer and falls into a pool, ha ha, very funny. Guy gets drunk and runs on street naked, ha ha, I can't stop laughing. Oh wait, that's because I'm not laughing.The story structure is again rehashed and very weak. You know how you have a typical 'verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus' structure in most songs? Same thing with teen comedies. It can be summarized as 'happy parts, more happy parts, sad parts, everything comes together part, happy parts'. The ending is your typical 'everything's fine and dandy' and is insanely annoying.Just avoid this movie unless you're a fan of the traits I mentioned. That is all.",Old School
111,shawny11_2001,Good for a laugh on a lonely saturday...,7,28 February 2003,"This isn't the same type of comedy that John Belushi put up before he passed away, but it is still funny.Ferrel does a good job as Frank the Tank, even with shots of his white butt and his...er-hemm. When he's on screen though he's the funniest of the bunch.Vaughn does a good job indeed. He's most amusing with his kid and the whole ""earmuffs"" gag. Very funny stuff.Wilson does a good job as basically a character like himself. Though the whole subplot with the boss' daughter is iffy, it's still amusing.Nudity...always good in a college flick such as this. All in all, just worth the 4.50 on a saturday afternoon.",Old School
112,redbirds525,GOOD AND FUNNY!,7,5 August 2003,"I first saw OLD SCHOOL in a Holiday Inn while I was debating whether to order that movie or re-watch GANGS OF NEW YORK to see if it got better the second time. I'm glad I chose OLD SCHOOL. This was one of those movies that came out and I said I was going to see, but never got around to it. Definitely one of the funniest movies of 2003, right behind AMERICAN WEDDING and BRUCE ALMIGHTY.The Will Ferrell streaking scene is worth the price of a rental at the video store. If you want a good laugh, check out OLD SCHOOL. Vince Vaughn is great in it, especially when he covers his baby's ears before he swears.",Old School
113,Headbiscuit,Old Material makes a mixed bag,5,1 March 2003,"Humorous to some extent, this film was so up in the air that I never was quite certain whether to enjoy it or not.  No doubt, there were some funny parts, but often they were so few and far between that the film really lagged on me.  The start of the film was especially slow before we really get introduced to the characters.  I didn't out loud laugh until about 20-25 minutes into the film.  After that point there were some real good moments, but the editing of the film was pretty poor with bad leadins, and no continuation of humor.  Therefore, the humor derived from mainly one-liners and odd sexual situations.  Andy Dick was annoying - I loathed the parts that he was in.  The wife's character should have been dumped as well because she seemed to just pop up in scenes from time to time with no real contribution to the humor.  Sure the carrot was kinda humorous, but with Andy Dick in the scene, it was basically no good.  Along those lines, a host of others characters were underdeveloped.  Most obvious to me was the teenage girl played by Elisha Cuthberg.  At the beginning of the flick, it appears she'll be a regular character, but then she just kinda flops out and the movie ends without explaining anything.  I would have rated the film a 4/10, but the scenes during the credits definately bumped it up to a 5/10.  The film was enjoyable at times, but the lack of orginal material and funny gags left a bad taste in my mouth. Will was great in his scenes, but he couldn't lift the rest of the misplaced cast to great heights.  If some better actors had replaced Andy Dick, Craig Kilborn, and a few more of the slumping cast, this could have been better. Overall though, the plot was weak, and even crazy gross out humor didn't provide enough entertainment for me to not miss the $7.50 that I paid for the ticket.  If you want some good college style humor films, I'd recommend sticking with some of the classics like Animal House.",Old School

116,Mr_Vai,Hit and Miss Comedy,6,2 September 2004,"This film does have some of the funniest scenes of any movie I have seen in awhile. Moreover, it has some major heavyweight talent, with Farrell, Vaughn and Wilson. Heck, the Dan Band alone is worth paying the rental fee. HOWEVER, there are some real duds sprinkled into this work. All parts dealing with Andy Dick should have been left on the cutting room floor. Craig Kilborn is also wasted in a ridiculous role. It just makes for an uneven film. You laugh your head off at one crazy segment and then you kind of roll your eyes at some of the other stuff that is so forced. This movie could have been great, had the story been tightened up a bit. However, some of the subplots are just tacked on for attempted laughs and do not enhance the story. In fact, they really detract from the film. I am sure that younger generations will claim this movie as their generation's ""Animal House"" and I guess that is OK, but it could have been better.",Old School
117,jediduck95,Frat Pack climax,7,10 July 2005,"This is one of the better if the not the funniest of the 'frat pack' movies. I love 'animal house', and this movie basically pays tribute to it. It's probably the closest thing to a sequel to 'animal house that we're ever going to get. It's definitely a great movie to watch with your college friends even if you hate fraternities. The movie starts out funny but it loses steam. Most of the characters are funny, and Will Farrell is probably the funniest of the cast. Cuthbert is smoking hot with her cameo which is alright by me.The director has some funny jokes but it's not enough to reach a full potential (like 'road trip'). If he took more time with the jokes and the plot then this movie could of been a classic 'frat pack' movie.This is definitely a guilty pleasure with some laugh out loud jokes and funny situations. The movie loses steam when the plot balances itself between being serious and being funny.",Old School
118,Phrankster163,"Fun, but we've seen it before",6,4 June 2006,"Old School is the Animal House and Revenge of the Nerds of the new millennium, and like those movies you know pretty much what to expect. Plenty of raunchy physical comedy, bare breasts a-plenty and a dean you're meant to hate. What is supposed to set this one aside from the others, is that it's about three guys in their early thirties, who are trying to get in touch with their youth again. In some ways it does accomplish that, but to me it's just not original enough to stand alone, and thus becomes just another one in the genre. Vince Vaughn plays the same character we've seen him play in pretty much every comedy he's been in, Luke Wilson does well as the straight guy among them and Will Ferrell gets to be Will Ferrell like we know and love him. The cameos are well done, but Sean William Scott's character IS Steve Stiffler, just with a really bad haircut. It's not really a ""Laugh out loud"" movie, but it has it's moments, that's for sure.",Old School

Although i found that the previews took some of the bite out of the funnier bits---I know i would have laughed harder if i didn't already know the punch lines. While I recommend watching this one, i'm pleading: for the love of god, don't make a sequel to it. The ending to Old School sets up uncomfortably well for a sequel, and that left me with a bad taste in my mouth. What with all the HORRIBLE sequels that came out and are due out, I think it would be a nice gesture to just let a movie stand by itself for once. Just my 2 cents. Peace :o)",Old School

I went to see this movie in the theater with my fraternity ""brothers"", who all thought that it would be a good film to watch, because no one loves stereotypical frat movies more than frat boys themselves. Ill admit that I wanted to see this movie because it looked funny initially, and I really wanted to like it, but the jokes were just not funny. The writers tried so hard to make the audience laugh, but they failed miserably. Will Farrel showed an utter lack of talent by embarrassing himself in front of national audiences. I really feel bad for the guy, Ill never  look at him in the same way again. Overall, there were good intentions, but the film makers failed to deliver resulting in a huge disappointment.

Only 1 of the 3 leads has any comic sensibility and his part (will ferrell) is played so over the top that it's almost pathetic. Vaughn and Wilson prove again they have no business in a comedy, Piven, usually funny is also wasted.The plot and screenplay, if you can call it that is something a 6th grade lunchroom could've come up with. But it's obvious that this movie is not about plot, but about jokes. The only problem is the premise is so pathetic and just down right stupid that the jokes fail.I know I am in the majority here, but I have seen the movie 3 times now, and have not so much as chuckled once, let alone laugh.

I had to give it a 7, because it's not a 10. It's not like Animal House, or is it? Old School starts out funny, but ends kind of dull. Where is Vince Vaughn in the last 20 something minutes of the film? The plot is easy to the eye, but funny to the brain. The most funniest scenes are the ones that have dirty humor. But, I love Old School. Frank the Tank, played by Will Ferral is the funniest guy in the movie. It has a funny base, but like I said the last part of it doesn't really match up to the beginning. Sure, it's an all around film, but the plot could be a little bit more in depth. If you laughing, rent it. If you like frats and colleges, borrow it. If you like Animal House, buy it.",Old School

I generally enjoy American comedies and Old School does have it's comical moments, but didn't really make me laugh much. Maybe because I'm not an American, I don't know. There are some interesting characters here, but the story is a bit too wacky for me and gets boring at times. Will Ferrel is great though and the funniest scene is actually during the end credits, so be sure to stick around for that.Some people here say this is the funniest movie ever made, and I'm sure they think so. It basically boils down to what kind of humor you like, so if the story here appeals to you the humor might too.",Old School

Of the actors Vince Vaughn I think stole the show with some creative, smooth talking of his lines that blended quite well with his character. Luke Wilson was the one weakness this movie had in its actors and they should have looked elsewhere to another actor for this role. Overall a watchable film but nothing really to write home about.",Old School

I laughed or smiled pretty much continuously for the whole film. It was only a 7/10 because it isn't going to go down as a fantastic comedy and I probably won't go out of my way to watch it again. It was a light hearted comedy, very typical of Will Ferrell.Although the film was funny, it wasn't good enough to stand out from the crowd, as did American Pie amongst others.

128,sthapns247,Have you ever seen one of those movies?,8,20 June 2003,"Have you ever seen one of those movies with one of your friends that was supposed to be really funny, but there was really only one good scene in the whole movie?  But that one scene was SO funny that you and your friend came up with little jokes and about it and quoted it when you're together and stuff?  Well, for this movie at least, the scene is about 4 minutes into the movie and it's only about 1 hour and 28 minutes long... and if you count the videos during the credits that may add another 3 or 4 minutes to it.  So obviously this movie isn't that funny.. IT'S F*****' HILARIOUS!!! I'm serious, this movie is hilarious from the beginning to the end... sure it has it's slow points, but I've yet to see a movie that didn't have at least one boring part in it.  There are cheap jokes and some stuff that has been seen in other movies, but there are also plenty of original moments and Will Ferrell really makes the movie what it is.  Vince Vaughn could have had a much bigger part, but what he does have he plays perfectly.  And Luke Wilson... well he plays his role good, but it's really not what makes the movie funny. Unfortunately this movie also has the same weak points, as do other movies that could have been way better.  As far as I'm concerned a comedy and romance do not mix.  Love is not funny no matter what you do and the stupid little thing goin' on between Mitch and the girl I can't even remember... the movie would have been just as funny with out it, but then I guess Craig Kilborn wouldn't have been in it and that would have been a shame because I think he is one of the best late night hosts ever.

After seeing it, I should have just listened to my instincts. While Vince Vaughn turned in another fine comedic performance, the rest of the cast was subpar. Luke Wilson did not have one funny moment, Andy Dick's cameo was insanely stupid, and Will Farrell was below his normally high standards. Farrell actually goes a little too overboard here. Except for Vaughn's ability to make any scene he's in have some sort of comedic value, the rest of the movie rely's on cheap laughs that will soon be forgotten. A man running naked? Someone sleeping with his boss's high school daughter? Andy Dick playing a flamboyant gay man? All of these got laughs from the crowd, but nobody will remember these lame thrills the day after. Other than Vaughn, the only value I obtained from watching this movie was seeing about 8 insanely gorgeous women.

I didn't like the main idea at all, i.e. some fraternity for older people, and their fight to keep on going. However, there are some ingenious bits, such as Will Farrell running along naked thinking he had others following him, and many more. One brilliant sequence deserves special mention: when Will Farrell has fallen into a swimming pool, messed up on tranquilizer, and has a fantasy on a beach dreaming up an ex. Which of course turns out to be a drug-created dream, but the sequence is amazing. And then there is Elisha Cuthbert. Her role is relatively small, but memorable.

Basically it relates to men because we all want to be part of something like an Army platoon, sports team, Elks Club or other male bonding fraternity. Like most guys over 30 we don't have that anymore as we are wrapped up in jobs and family but these guys were able to create a place where men could be men.

First came the occasionally funny Porkys then the surprisingly good Police Academy and a string of duds that I don't care to remember. Since the sometimes talented Will Farrell has starred in some of the worst movies ever made, it was no surprise that Old School should have been as equally unfunny.Will, I TAKE IT BACK! I came into the theater expecting a disappointment, and found myself laughing all the way through it and Farrell gives a performance that would almost equal that of the late John Belushi (of whom there was nobody better).Mitch (Luke Wilson) returns home to discover his girlfriend in the middle of a threesome. Realizing that her excuses are like a butt (everybody's got one) he almost buys into her lies until a knock at the door from a gentleman (no, not a Jehovah's Witness or Mormom) announces that he is hear for the gang bang.Meanwhile Will Farrell (Frank Richard) is getting married despite warnings at the alter from Vince Vaughn who whispers ""this is the last vagina for the rest of your life."" This leads some very funny moments in particular the wedding singer who at the reception has his own version of a famous love song. Mitch eventually moves into a house on a college dorm and funny guy Vaughn (Bernard Campbell) shows his friendship by throwing a party to ""ease the pain"" of his failed relationship. Frank assures his wife that he will behave and that lasts about 1 minute after he arrives.The next morning, the dean (four eyed geek Jeremy Piven) cocks up an idea to have them kicked off campus unless they are able to form an actual fraternity. While the idea seems impossible, the Three Stooges find a way to pull it off.One of the nice things in a movie is to see the co-star provide most of the laughs like Steve Martin did in Little Shop Of Horrors and Kevin Kline In A Fish Called Wanda. While Farrell is billed third on the credits, he is the star. This is not an exaggeration especially when Farell shoots himself in the neck with a tranquilizer and the rest, you just have to see. Even critic Roger Ebert (who awarded the film one star) admitted that Will Farrell had some nice scenes.Like all comedies, the laughs aren't always there but there are a lot of them in Old School that makes you just want to stand up and yell, ""lets party""!",Old School

It came out on DVD and ran to the local video store to rent it, love it, then buy the DVD.It just did not work out that way.Don't get me wrong.  This IS a funny film.  Will Farrell is spectacular and Vince Vaughn plays his ""Swingers"" character as an older married parent, and is very good as well.  I laughed out loud on numerous occassions - and there are many quality ""quotes"" (the measurement of a comedy for guys).My beef with the film is that it could have been much better.  The premise is fantastic, and they do not capitalize enough on the squareness that becomes your life as you grow older.  There is less party and goofy scenarios as the older guys try to relate to the younger guys (Will Farrell's explanation of his 'big' Saturday not withstanding), and too much of Luke Wilson's love story and dopey ""gross out scenes"".

139,thewholebrevitything,Ferrel & Vaughan shine in this bland unfunny turkey,5,28 March 2005,"I like Will Ferrel and Vince Vaughan is an excellent actor (watch him in swingers he is awesome). Unfortunately they are wasted in this movie, a very bland attempt at re hashing tired clichés for other movies (fightclub, animal house, porkys, van wilder, American pie, billy Madison). Todd Philips directs very amateurishly. The camera work is very sloppy with no sense of rhythm which is incredibly important in a comedy to underpin the flow of the jokes. It is badly edited spoiling what jokes there are (And there are some good ones). Some of them however are incredibly pathetic and predictable - for instance the re-occurrence of the toaster gift. When Vince Vaughans son receives a gift you just know what it s going to be based on its size. Its sits there for about 20 seconds before its revealed - thats bad camera work, a good director would hide its size until the last moment thus adding an affectation of surprise to the albeit obvious punch line. Not to mention the fact that this is the third time someone receives it as a gift - Just to make sure we really really had no chance of seeing that one coming. A joke is good once, three times it just starts to get old.Todd Philips isn't that great a writer of comedy either. What writer with any ability has to bilk jokes and scenes from other films ?For instance there's the painfully bad homage to fight club with the waiter and colleague wanting to be part of the fraternity and then toward the end of the film it descends into an exact copy of the last 30 minutes of billy Madison - IE. hero has to prove oneself before the academic community in adebate/sporting/qu iz type scenario before villain self-destructs. If that wasn't bad enough just before the final credits roll we see the old man 'blue' dressed as an angel singing at a piano just like we saw carl weathers do it at the end of 'happy gilmore'. Then you have Juliette Lewis who's performance at the start was so badly acted you realize why she was so good at playing trailer trash whores - because thats what comes naturally, but even here she fails.A Message to Todd Philips. 2 things.1) Next time let Vince Vaughan and Will Ferrel write and direct. 2) Sit back, pay attention and LEARN how real talented people operate.5/10",Old School

And it didn't take me long to figure out why I enjoy this movie so much: with its Whitesnake references and silly college setting, it reeks of a nostalgia that I can personally identify with.  Additionally, I was watching this with my roomies that I've known since grade school, and concluded that the three main characters are us in about 3-5 years.  8/10 (this is a subjective assessment)",Old School
141,puckbond007,"Old School-7/10 is a fun, crude comedy...",7,14 March 2003,"Possible SpoilersOld School is a fun, crude comedy in the style of National Lampoon's Animal House. The plot is silly and the characters are pretty one dimensonal, but this movie is consistently funny throughout. It made me smile and it made me laugh and I certainly enjoyed it for what it is. Luke Wilson plays Mitch Martin aka The Godfather, who comes home from his dreary job to find his girlfriend played by Juliette Lewis mixed up in some wild orgy. Will Ferrell is very funny as Frank a man who is just getting married to the wrong woman and Vince Vaughn is also very good as Beanie, a sarcastic, witty guy who spends no time with his woman, but looks after their son. Mitch tries to move on with his life by moving into a new house that happens to be on a college campus. Vince Vaughn sees this as an opportunity to rekindle his youth by moving in and starting a fraternity. Ferrell, after being on the outs with his wife needs a place to crash and joins the other two. Mitch is rather conservative and resists the idea of a fraternity at first...a fraternity which gets mostly old guys who are trying to find ways to still have some fun...and none of these guys go to the school. Of course they are a hit with the students as the fraternity throws wild parties, and gets into all sorts of trouble etc. and basically do what fraternities do. The always fun Jeremy Piven plays Dean Pritchard, who naturally disapproves of the unorthodox fraternity and tries to get them kicked out of the house...he wants to put them on ""double secret probation!"" Anyway I found it rather amusing that Piven was in this cliche role going against type of roles he usually does as in the character he played in the college comedy PCU(1994). The fun of this movie just comes from guys like Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn and the absurd and funny situations everbody gets in to. It's a comedy that doesn't hold back on the crude humor, but it never really is gross-out type stuff which is a good thing. Mitch's love interest Nicole is played by Ellen Pompeo, who is very sweet and while watching her I realized she reminds me of Renee Zellweger. There are also appearances in this film by Late Night talk show host Craig Kilborn, rapper Snoop Dogg, 24 sweetie Elisha Cuthbert, King of Queens' Leah Remini and American Pie's Stiffler aka Sean William Scott, who appears in a very funny scene. Overall, Old School is what it is...a funny, uproarious comedy about having all the fun of college without having to go to school.

This has got to be one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. My only problem is that it wasn't straight to video so I could watch it again. How could a movie be more perfect? Ivan Reitman and Joe Medjuck straight outta Ghostbusters working on it, an AWESOME cast, it all falls into some of the funniest movie moments ever. SO funny it's insane. See it. Then see it again!!

144,natport19,"one of the funnier ""college"" films of all time",6,12 March 2003,"What National Lampoon wouldn't give to get their name preceding this one instead of last year's Van Wilder.  Comparable to Animal House, Old School offers the gross out humor and stupidity without being too gross or too stupid.  Including all-around great performances by, just about, the entire cast (Craig, stick to late night), this is likely to be remembered as one of the funnier `college' films of all time.Although only a handful of the fraternity members are actually enrolled at the college in which their frat house lies on campus, the expression `guys will be guys' reigns supreme.  If you do not think Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, and Vince Vaughn grasping for yesteryear is pathetically hilarious, then do not see Old School.  On the other hand, if you enjoy the straight faced humor of Wilson, the outrageous style of Ferrell, or even the show stealing subtlety of Vaughn, then you can afford to miss it as much as you can afford a ticket to an evening admittance.  In other words, stick to the matinee just in case.This marks the second straight success from director Todd Phillips.  His Road Trip proved to be funny even if you dismissed the few scenes starring Tom Green, which seemed to be edited in last minute anyway.  It is sad when a movie's sole purpose is to make you laugh, and it does not even succeed in doing so.  Unlike too many movies already this year, Old School is an absolute riot from start to finish.  Just make sure it is actually over before you leave.*** out of ****",Old School

I wasn't overly enthusiastic at first; it looked to be the typical american slap-stick/bottom-humour comedy which is so typical of hollywood - completely moronic and unappealling.

Piven as the evil dean...its great to see him play the exact opposite of his role in PCU.  Plus Craig Kilborn as an arrogant jerk (it flows so easily for him).  Finally, Ferrell, now I usually don't find him that funny on saturday night live....but in this movie he is HILARIOUS! Much credit has to be given to the writers for giving the Frank character such great lines (even subtle ones like fitting in the lame white guy expression ""good stuff"", just wonderful writing), and Ferrell nails each and every line!It isn't winning any oscars, but hey, 'Shakespeare in love' and 'Chicago' won a bunch of them so that shows that oscars aren't worth very much. *** (out of 4)",Old School

Luke Wilson arrives home and finds his girlfriend getting ready to have a massive orgy with a bunch of blindfolded, closet-hidden strangers and he realizes= ""Why should I have to deal with this?"" So he moves back into a college neighborhood and without even joining the school, starts a fraternity in a house with some friends. Will Ferrell has just gotten married and realizes that he will indeed only have ""one vagina for the rest of his life"". He decides to have some fun and join the frat, where kidnapping new students to bring to the frat is the norm. Vince Vaughn is also among the frat-house dwellers, bringing many laughs to this picture.This was an entertaining piece of movie= it had a good cast, lots of laughs (nude lubricant jelly wrestling, tie-a-brick-to-your-thing frat initiation, and tranquilizer gunshots to Ferrell's neck as he falls and sinks into a pool to the tune of Simon and Garfunkel's ""Sound of Silence"") and also a motivation factor: I plan to join the Sigma Chi fraternity when I move into my college this fall.

And Wilson plays the straight man very well.  Yes Old School is in the same Genre as Animal House, and no it is probably not as good, but why should it have to be. It is a comedy, it made me laugh, it fulfilled its purpose.

The idea of 3 older men moving onto campus is original but the jokes are pretty similar to what we have all seen before. However that does not mean its not funny, because it is a major laugh out loud film that will have you sniggering away like a 6 year old that just heard the word ""sex"". The humour is daft, characters like 'Frank the Tank' are silly but hilarious. What makes the film just that little bit different is the perspective of the older man re-living his youth in such a blunt and brash way.

Why is it that nowadays good humor movies are ruined by filling half the movie with nude people and dirty jokes? It's not necessary to do that in order to make a successful funny movie.If all that stuff is cut out, you only have half the movie left. Really it's bad taste.

As some others criticize Old School for its lack of story and exaggeration of sub plots, I didn't have a problem with it. Some of the funniest scenes were scenes that were not vital to simply the core of the story. In a movie like Old School, viewers are concerned with the story so much as the humor. Therefore I don't see a problem with the straying from the storyline. All in all Old School is very funny. Perhaps not the most original or artistic film, Old School accomplishes what it is meant to do, make the viewer laugh out loud.7/10",Old School

157,greymumster,Where 'the child within' remains buoyant into middle age and beyond,8,14 March 2005,"Look I don't know if anyone else does this? When I rent movies, what I like to do is choose two or three films to watch back to back, in a sort of film-binge. I take quite a bit of care to choose films that will 'work' together in a symbiotic resonance with each and my particular mood. It might be mono-genre fest, a world cinema whammy, old film/new remake combo or a mix and match melange. Whatever! When I'm watching with anyone else I prefer to do a quirky pairing that will promote a full on post-pleasure chin-wag. This explains why I watched OLD SCHOOL and SIDEWAYS at the same sitting. What an interesting pairing! They are both Men Behaving Badly/ Buddy Rites de Passage vehicles. They are both variants of very funny, they are both cast with known and admired funny-men, they both have comparatively young new directors, they both feature weddings and boys downtime antics.etc.etc. I love sniffing out blossoming social trend in movies (used to be in fashion forecasting). For me watching from a female perspective, the most notable thing was how both scripts constructed a scenario that allows the juvenile phase of manhood to be extended way into middle age and far beyond. the thirties are new forties and I don't think it is entirely because the bestest funny guys are that age and need continuity of work! I maybe wrong here but the film industry doesn't seem to be providing the same comedic opportunities to female actors. There have been offerings in the grey spinster/old girls genre, but they are usually serious emotional dramas. It seems so unfair that the chaps are allowed to keep their child within buoyant for ever and us women are doomed to a bitter croneship getting continually cosmetically upgraded to deny our age.I do realise films are not real life but I think you will agree there is an audience/ film interaction going on that informs society?. Old bags have a sense of lightweight fun as well, so where are all the youthful girly directors prepared to have a laugh at their own expense???

160,phrosty20,Too old for much fun...,5,12 March 2003,"""Old School"" disappointed me.  I've been a fan of Will Ferrell for a while, and he was hilarious.  Unfortunately, he's the only redeeming factor in this film, a good waste of the rest of the people involved.The characters are all classic cliches of college frat movies (only older): the lovable/aloof kind of dorky guy with a heart of gold, the indominable, obnoxious, lady killer/party guy, the blissfully dumb guy who everybody loves, the anal retentive dean who can find nothing more important to do than try and shut the fraternity down, etc. (played respectively by Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn, Will Ferrell, and Jeremy Piven), the latter in an in-joke role reversal to anyone who's ever seen ""PCU"" (airing daily on Comedy Central at 3 p.m....seriously).Mitch, played by Luke Wilson, is the main character, having recently divorced his wife after finding her involved in her kinky antics.  To make a long story short, Mitch and his fellow buddies in their early 30s decide to form a fraternity to alleviate their relative crisises, and invite a wide variety of guys from all age groups to join (from 18 up to 90).  Wild and crazy hijinks ensue, the dean gives them a hard time, the frat eventually prevails, ya, ya, ya...you know the drill.  But then I don't expect many people going to see ""Old School"" wanting (or expecting) a great plot.
There's also a pointless sub-plot involving Luke Wilson, a former girl friend, and her jerky boyfriend (played by Craig Kilborn).  Snoop Dogg makes a cameo near the beginning of the movie in a scene that feels like it should've been at the end of the movie rather than in the first 20 minutes (as it was probably the funniest).  If you're a fan of the TV show ""24"", you'll recognize a couple of faces, including Elisha Cuthbert and Matthew Carey, the former in a role as Mitch's boss' daughter and the latter as one of the fraternity brothers.Since I knew who was working the box office at the time, I got in to see ""Old School"" for free.  I wouldn't recommend seeing it unless you happen to be in a similar situation, in which case it isn't a bad way to blow an hour and a half.

This courage inspires the small ammount of fear in the audience that is required for real humour. It took guts to put the blowjob class in this film. It took producorial mox to have the KY jelly fight.This film was outrageous, and it worked.

Vince Vaughn (coolest actor of the new generation) carries this film with great help from will Ferrell and a so-so lead from Luke Wilson. Elisha Cuthbert's small role oozes the sexuality that she awesomely possesses (marry me please), a sexuality that made her pretty outstanding in The Girl Next Door.This film is heavily quotable (especially Vaughn's character) and appeals to both sexes, if your looking for a Saturday night riot of a movie, with awesome belly laughs, look no further than Old School. 9/10",Old School

I'll get back to that in a minute.This is probably the first movie in a long while to make me laugh as much as it did.  It's also the first in a long while that makes me want to buy it when it comes out on DVD.  I'll spare you the redundant plot summary to say that Old School is not the thinking man's comedy - if you want that, go rent a Woody Allen movie.  Will Farrell, while not the main character manages to deftly steal almost every scene he is in.  Vince Vaughan gives a great performance as a very jaded, cynical person who's blind to his own hypocrisy.  Finally, in the lead role, Luke Wilson cemented his growing reputation as a formidable comedic actor.  He is one to be watched, as well as his brother Owen (i.e. ""The Royal Tenenbaums"").  But the great cast doesn't end there - look for great turns by Andy Dick, Craig Kilborn, and Elisha Cuthbert (rrrow!).Getting back to the Animal House comparison (which is everywhere I look for reviews or any kind of movie information about Old School), I argue that this is the better movie.  Perhaps it's just my own opinion, but I never found Animal House as funny as people claimed it to be.  In addition, it's outdated (released in 1978, set in the year 1962), and Old School is a better reflection of today's college campuses and today's greek houses.  In the end, maybe I prefer Snoop Dogg to Otis Day and the Knights, but I give this movie 4 stars out of 4 stars (obviously this is not the same scale that I'd put The Godfather on, but you get the idea).",Old School

Wilson's character is questionable. In the group he works very well, but alone he is uninteresting. However, Will Ferrell is a comic genius and propels the movie into greatness. Old School may not have an involving story or a lesson to teach, but it succeeds on almost every level as a free-for-all comedy and may end up becoming the Animal House for a new generation.

The best way to describe it is that this movie is for the very immature and self centered losers who peaked in high school and couldn't climb out of being a kid and actually become a REAL Adult who is successful personally as parents and REAL Adults.

When will filmmakers finally realize that when we go to see movies like this, we're not looking for a compelling story? I don't really care whether or not a group of slackers are able to make good and create a counter 'Greek' movement of their own, thereby redeeming all geeks, freaks and outcasts for generations to come.

You don't start with a bland script, and hope they'll infuse a little life into it. These funnymen obviously did the best they could with decidedly lackluster material. Big disappointment.",Old School

I was laughing so hard that my body couldn't take it anymore. My wife and I went to see this movie this weekend and we haven't stopped talking about it. There are so many memorable moments in the movie that we just laugh for no reason when thinking about it. One memory is the therapist-waitress-underwear scene. If you've seen it, you know what I'm talking about. I guess if you have no sense of humor, you won't like this movie. That's probably the reason that critics haven't blessed this movie. None of those guys have any sense of humor. This is irrelevant, but Will was back on SNL this weekend 2/22/03. If you didn't see it, you missed a great Will cameo!",Old School

The Rush Initiation was something Animal House did not do, such as cinder blocks to...yea. However the scene with the blow up doll was much like the crashing manequin in animal house.  the dean closing the fraternity obviously a reference to dean wormer in animal house, yet comes up with its own brand of humor.  the KY Jelly wrestling for example.  pure genius.  all in all 7*'s out of 10*'s",Old School

Yet another film where will ferrell steals the show, just as he did in zoolander and starsky and hutch (thats no disrespect to stiller, vaughn or the Wilson boys!). This film has so many wee lines and scenes which you may not even notice the first time you see it but become hilarious and unforgettable after several viewings with your friends over a few beers. One example is the way Ferrell reacts after (SPOILER?) taking his first beer at the party and there is of course the well known brilliant consequences of these beers, not to mention the scene with the tranquilizer dart! A great show which fans of ferrell, Wilson and co. will love and anyone who enjoys dumb, entertaining comedies about grown men acting like complete idiots!!!",Old School
183,Valley_Of_Fire,"Several funny parts, but Wilson is mis-cast",6,23 February 2003,"I wasn't prepared for how vulgar Old School was. Not that I minded, mind you, but some of it was so frank (for lack of a better word) that I was thankful many times that I went to see it with a friend, and not with my parents.That being said, let me say that there are several big laughs in Old School, along with some that don't work, some that are missed, and some jokes that are drawn out too long.The best thing about Old School is that the characters don't mature, or learn life lessons in it. It saves time, and allows for more jokes. The plot in a nutshell: A man (Luke Wilson) arrives at his house to find his girlfriend cheating on him (with two guys), so he moves away, near a university (so close he's practically on it). His friends (Will Ferrell and Vince Vaughn) decide that it would be a good idea to turn his house into a frat house, and hold wild parties, etc etc etc. But then, the dean, who the guy and his friends had mocked in college decides to try and kick them out.What I like about the plot is that everyone likes the idea of a frat house, except the dean. Wilson's character, who we would expect to hold out for a while, is among the first in the jelly tub wrestling with nude women. The problem with the film is the casting of Wilson. He is a talented actor, as seen in films written by his brother Owen (Rushmore etc.). He is above the gross out material in this film. He never really makes us believe his character's actions. He does stuff, but we just don't feel his character's heart is into it. The other actors, on the other hand, are perfectly chosen.Mr. Vaughn shows that he is good in all kinds of comedy, from low-brow humor like this to higher-brow like Swingers. He doesn't have a lot of the best scenes, but he makes what he's given work. His character is always seen with his child, and many jokes are made when he has his child cover his ears (""earmuffs!"") so he can swear. I can imagine a guy doing this, so its funny. Far funnier than movies where the kids scream out profanity for laughs.But Will Ferrell is the major find. Almost everything he does creates a laugh in this film, and even if this movie doesn't make a lot of money, he'll be in demand. He does do some gross stuff, the scene where he streaks, for example, is played out too long, and is too graphic.I said earlier that there are missed jokes. Some of them are so obvious that they're practically on the tip of the actor's tongues. For example, there's a scene when Ferrell's character is debating how he should dress up his adult blow up doll. A little girl and her mother are standing outside the house, everyone is embarrassed when they hear him. Doesn't take a genius to have the little girl cry out ""I wanna play with the dolly!"" or something like that. I'm going too in depth into the film. For the most part, its very funny. There are a few scenes that are unneeded (the previously mentioned streaking scene is funny, but goes too close to full frontal nudity)- the orgy scene at the beginning could do without the showing of hard-core porn. And the scene where topless girls wrestle is sexy, but isn't needed as well. And the class where women are instructed on how to do a certain sexual move wasn't funny. Sometimes its much funnier to imply something than to show it. That's something the filmmakers needs to learn.If you like low-brow humor, you'll find a lot to find in this film. It will not be up for any awards, it will probably not be remembered in 10 years. But if what I said earlier, about graphic sexual situations and the like, doesn't bother you, then you'll probably like it a lot. But if you don't like sick humor, you won't like it. If you like anyone in the cast you'll probably like it- keeping in mind that this isn't like Wilson's more mature work. I debated between giving it a 6 & a 7. If you laughed at the preview, you'll laugh in the film. Just don't go see it with your parents.",Old School

So the main characters are not spotty teenagers and early 20s undergraduates but 30 somethings looking to recapture a part of their lives where the days were spontaneous and unpredictable, the nights long (with you awake), and the parties drunken.Will Ferrell is awesome in this!

It should have a higher rating but I guess some people thought it was average. but to tell the truth it kicked some major comedy's to the curve. Not using so much of a teenage scene they conquered the mix of adulthood with college students forming a fan base for both a younger and older audience. By younger I mean 16 and up but usually movies either aim for 16 to 25 years of age. But this movie provides an entertainment that everyone can enjoy yes even your grandma.

Maybe not a film for everyone, and a bit predictable, but it's a comedy!  To me, the laughs are more important than the story, so don't be too picky about it, and try to have fun when you watch it.

It's not a great movie, but it does have its moments and in some respects it surprised me.My expectations were low. I had expected this to be another comedy with too many bathroom jokes.  At this point, I can't recall a single mindless bathroom joke.  Mind you there is a ""streaking"" scene, which I thought was very funny.  I believe it's in the trailer for this movie.I still can't figure out why this was rated ""R"".. There was one very quick, gratuitous breast scene which probably got this movie the ""R"" rating. However, it's as if that scene were thrown into the movie just to ensure it did get a ""R"" rating.  There are no ""sex"" scenes, no violence and little bad language.  I wouldn't be bothered if my 12 year old daughter saw this movie.Now the premise of the movie is very unrealistic.. older friends ban together to create a new fraternity on campus.. a fraternity with students and non-students, with younger and older men.Maybe the best part of this movie is that it's only 1.5 hours.  After seeing ""God and Generals"".. (almost 4 hours) it was nice to go to a movie edited into a 1.5 hour format, a movie that deals up mindless entertainment in a silly, but tasteful way.",Old School

If you want something that is both funny and original you are best suited to stick with things that confront life from the gallows, where it was once observed the only true humor exists.  That is, see Kill Bill, Dr. Strangelove or American Psycho for a unique and thrilling movie that is hilarious.  The importance of this movie is evident by the way that it has invaded our current lexicon.  I dare say all of you have heard someone at a party or on the street shout out something of the nature of ""frank the tank"" or ""your my boy blue, your my boy"" etc... My suggestion is to watch this movie with beer and friends and try to enjoy hilarious actors having fun (my guess is that much of the movie was filmed a high degree of improv). Ferrell and Vaughn are hilarious and the movie never claimed originality, so why should it be critiqued for not attaining something to which it never aspired in the first place?  Watching this movie with a light heart and being prepared to accept it for what it is/what it was intended to be, can make it a truly enjoyable experience.",Old School

As they try to relive their college glory days, they have to convince the Dean of the school (Jeremy Piven) that they are qualified enough to start their own chapter.

But if you live overseas, be cautious with your children (if you have) because the movie was allowed to all audiences (in most of European countries). Prevent them from watching this awful and very vulgar recipe. All you will find in it is rubbish at all levels. Not even a piece of laughter.

My only problem is that the plot is nearly an exact copy of the far superior Animal House,with comic genius John Belushi. You would think they could come up with something a bit more original. Still, it makes for a good viewing if you want Will Ferrel's outrageous brand of comedy. I have to admit he does a great job here, partial nudity seems to be a sort of specialty of his, apparent since SNL days. A good movie in a dumb way in all, but see Animal House too.",Old School

It seems like the director & writers took a drama about a group of 30-somethings trying to come to terms with their age, and then added some ridiculous scenes and a poorly written villain character in an attempt to make it funny.The result is a movie that isn't good at either -- there aren't enough funny scenes to make it good comedy, nor is the story developed enough to make it a good drama (or even romantic-comedy).  Instead, it just floats somewhere in between, moving from forced wackiness to schmaltzy romantic-comedy scenes, and following non-believable plot lines.There are a few funny moments (the emergence of Frank the Tank at their first party is my favourite), but not enough to make me ever sit through it a second time.",Old School

237,johnsjacobsen,Almost as good as modern comedies get,10,26 February 2003,"Great movie, although the second half drags down the stellar first half. The movie is about 15-25 minutes too short, and needs more scenes involving the fraternity and parties.  The ending seems kind of abrubt, but other than that no complaints.  The front three of Luke Wilson, Will Ferrell, and Vince Vaughn all are excellent, especially Ferrell.  Funny actions and very quotable lines.  Wilson suprised me, because usually the lead/straight man is not funny, but he was.  Ferrell's performance is reminiscent of the immortal Senator John Blutarski (he was influenced and payed tribute to the great belushi, without ripping him off or trying to recreate him).
While the movie falls short of the pantheon of great guy comedies (fletch, animal house, caddyshack, swingers,), it is solidly entrenched in the level below (revenge of the nerds, tommy boy, stripes).  Great movie, cant wait till the DVD comes out, i hope it has extra footage worked into the movie.",Old School
238,johnsjacobsen,"Great Movie, but why did they take out all the extras?",10,11 June 2003,"Old School is about 90 minutes, which is the standard for dumb comedies (which i love).  However, despite all of the great parts in this movie, the last 20 minutes felt rushed and choppy, and really hurt the overall product. I left the theatre slightly disapointed, thinking about what could have been.  I bought the unrated DVD the first day it came out, and when i watched the deleted scenes, i was shocked.  THey were fantastic, funny, and ke to the movie.  I cannot figure out why they were cut.  My only hope is that the producers produce an extended version, that has all these scenes in the movie, plus anything else they cut.  Usually deleted scenes are left out for a good reason, they either suck, or mess with the flow too much.  Had the movie included the extra 20-30 minutes i saw on the DVD, i would have walked out comparing it to the other masterpieces like Caddyshack, trading places, and dumb and dumber.  I can't believe they had something so good and screwed it up so badly.  This is a movie about a fraternity, and that part is sorely neglected.  Also the ending is really weird, unexplained, and hard to believe.  Had they beefed it up and left in the many funny lines, the weirdness and plausibility would have been overlooked, like in most other classic stupid movies.Bottom line, great movie, kept out of the pantheon because of poor editing.",Old School

240,four_calendar_cafe,Lame and pointlessly vulgar,1,1 January 2010,"To start with, why make a comedy that is for the most of it not even funny? If your idea of a good laugh is Will Ferrel showing off his white fat ass running naked in the streets this film may be promising. But something is really wrong in this screaming advertisement of ""male freedom"" of brainless vulgarities parading as ""real men, untamed and free"" to go get ass drunk and something really wrong with imposing the idea that for men to have a good time must exclude marriage and children and certainly should include blow jobs as the utmost desirable form of sex.This is not a comedy; this is mental birth control with the target audience being the white race already on its way to extinction.I may give this movie more than it deserves on its own right, I might have tolerated it a bit better if this was the first of this kind, but then again, it was such a condensed ""piece"" that it definitely blew the fuse with me.I simply refuse to be manipulated by something this unoriginal and tediously forced.

241,CowboysGuy2824,This Millenium's ANIMAL HOUSE! A laugh-out-loud riot.....,10,19 February 2003,"Director Todd Phillips began his major filmmaking career with the teen hit ROAD TRIP, which is still one of the few teen sex comedies to be fairly respected, since it is one of the best ones of the new millenium. Even though filled with stereotypical characters (Sean William Scott's E.L. is exactly like American Pie's Stifler, Breckin Meyer is the regular straight man). Even so, the gross out effect wasn't at an ultimate high like today's Van Wilder and Slackers, but was similar to its role model film ANIMAL HOUSE.Phillips second attempt rejoins him with producer/Ghostbuster director Ivan Reitman and the familiar territory of the college grounds( Like ROAD TRIP and his independent film FRAT HOUSE). This time around, three thirty-year-olds are the swingers. Usually, these type of films are easy money making schemes for film companies. Though anytime three very well known actors are put into the same film, you can make a good bet someone cares about the dying genre. Phillips certainly does, and he takes his ability to tell a good joke to new lengths in the hilarious new film OLD SCHOOL.Luke Wilson (The Royal Tenenbaums, Charlie's Angels) is Mitch Martin, the typical straight man who recently broke up with his girlfriend Heidi, due to a weekly ""gang bang"" she has at their house when he is out on business. Not only did he lose the girl, but he also lost the house, forcing him to move into a house loacted on college campus. As a housewarming present, his friends Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and Frank (Will Ferrell) throw a party which changed the threes lives forever. The party inspires Beanie to open a fraternity (with people from eighteen to ninety years old) and Mitch will become the Godfather. The party also reintroduces Frank to his alter-ego (Frank the Tank) and addicted to alchohol for that moment on (resulting in a hilarious streaking incident).The Dean of the college technically controls the house, and forces the fraternity to move out. This act of revenge (the Dean and the main three were high school friends) causes everyone to act against him until the main event occurs: the Fraternity tests.Usually, any sex film released in the January to March slot is instant death from it. Look at 2002: Sorority Boys, Van Wilder, Slackers, and Crossroads were panned by the critics and audiences alike. Dreamworks must not feel very confident that the film will sell well, because its quality is in place. As a film of this genre, it rises as the best of the new millenium, surprising since it isn't a summer or winter release. Maybe the competition against GODS AND GENERALS is its best chance at success. Who knows? This film will no doubt be a success with the general audience, and the critics may very well give this film good ratings. Don't let the release date fool you.OLD SCHOOL doesn't require top notch acting, nor a lead with the talent of Luke Wilson. He did a great job in the intelligent comedy THE ROYAL TENENBAUMS, but after watching his most recent, one will finally realize how much of a flexible actor he really is. Within one or two films time, he can go from serious to having a blast, but most impressively however, is how easily he makes it look. He doesn't try to overact a simple role, and with his excellent line delivery and well acted facial expressions, he plays the straight man very well.Vince Vaughn is one of a few comedic actors I haven't had the pleasure of seeing in other films. Not that it is a huge deal, but a little regretful nevertheless. Within the first fifteen minutes of the film, mainly during Frank's wedding (his pleas are priceless), the audience gets the feeling he will be the big laugh getter of the film. Even though this reviewer is happy that he isn't the funniest part of the movie, there is no denying he is very good at making nearly any line funny.And, without further ado, is the ex-Saturday Night Live star. Starring in bombs like The Ladies Man, A Night at the Roxbury, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (the film itself bombed) and a hit with Zoolander, I always felt he was restricted to do what he does best: make people laugh. He never had a part overly hilarious or show stealing. May OLD SCHOOL be his first. Ferrell sure agreed to do a lot for his ""Frank the Tank"" character, and the risks sure payed off. Not only do we get the first of major laughs at the opening party, but his character is from beginning to end through the roof hilarious, especially during a scene with Seann William Scott as the owner of a powerful tranquilizer gun used for animals. The film should be seen for the fact is is just flat out entertaining, but two words should be enough to encourage another viewing: Will Ferrell. He is probably the most memorable character in these films since Stifler in American Pie.OLD SCHOOL is no Best Picture film. Nor is it a highly intelligent or original film. Those descriptions don't make it stupid, and surprisingly, not gross out and not fill of toilet humor and dick and fart jokes. The previews may be decieveing, as it shows it looks to be a gross out film. There is only one scene involving any bodily humor. When these jokes are done right, they're funny. It's done right. The rest is all physical humor and good, funny dialogue.Early word on this film has been very positive from a few critics and almost all of its main audience. It isn't necesarily a teen movie, since its main characters are thirty years old. The average age should be from college up, not the American Pie audience. The film is by far more intelligent than the average sex comedy, more witty, has better dialogue, and doesn't rely on the gross out affect. Great job by Phillips and co. for making one of the better raunchy comedies in a long time.***1/2 out of ****",Old School
242,gatorahab,a quasi-intelligent montage of animal house and sandler themes,9,23 February 2003,"I read a review in the Tampa Tribune that recommended watching Animal House for the 100th time rather than screening this movie.  Although Animal House will forever be the yardstick by which all fraternity comedies are measured, I would have to disagree with the Trib. This movie is definitely worth a screening.What critics often fail to understand (or at least ignore in order to remain marketable) is that a comedy is what it is.  Since moving pictures have existed for approximately a century (and the same basic formula for all comedic plots has persisted since antiquity), folks need not expect that a comedy be original. folks need only hope that a comedy refreshingly tweak old themes in order to induce frequent bouts of belly laughter, which is exactly what this flick does.The combination of will farrell, luke wilson, and vince vaughan is sheer genius.  farrell's frat-boy throwback rants are priceless, and the tranquilizer dart scene featuring ""stiffler,"" a pony, and a zany allusion to The Graduate is singlehandedly worth the price of admission.  True to form, every word out of Vince Vaughan's mouth is hilarious, not necessarily for the substance but for the sheer obnoxious self-assuredness of vaughan's delivery.  Just picture him standing on a diner table spouting off about Favreau being ""All Growed's Up"" and you know what I mean.  And Luke Wilson once again works his quirky straight man magic.  My only misgiving concerns the casting of Jeremy Piven as the evil dean.  Not that he didn't perform adequately, but in my opinion his performances in Singles, PCU, and Grosse Pointe Blanke necessitate the casting of Piven as a somewhat ""cooler"" character in a movie of this genre, despite his middle age.
In any event, ignore the naysayers.  this movie kicks the crap out of van wilder, and is worth the price of admission, notwithstanding it's unsubtle borrowings from animal house and its progeny.",Old School

I basically rent this crap movie just to see the hot women who were in it, but even that didn't save this film. Basically I am have nothing to add that others who panned this movie didn't except that your not missing much if you didn't see it. Same goes with anything with Will is in and he seems to be doing like 8 films a year. If Adam Sandler was the worst actor out of SNL in the 90s, well Will has taken over where he left off. At Least some Adam material has been watchable in recent years. But Will and the rest of the buffoons in this movie just get worse and worse see Wedding Crashers, Talledaga Nights, The Girl Next Door, and The Break Up. I basically just rent bad films like American Wedding and this one to see the hot women. Also this movie like oh about 50 that have come out since 1994 ripoff 70s and 80s films. This one stole things from Swingers, Stripes, Animal House, Gotcha, and Fast Times at Ridgemont High.",Old School

Just recently though i saw a copy of National Lampoons ""Animal House"" with John Belushi. Another funny movie. Watching this made me think that Old School is almost a remake, (albeit a bit better even) of this old 1978 movie. Both are good, and both worth watching.Lots of breasts out in Animal House - you blokes will love it. Too funny seeing the ""underwear"" of the girls back in the late 70's!In fact i think that Animal House has spawned a lot of copies over the years... road trips, frat houses, - this is almost the blue print for teen and early adult comedies!!!Dan.",Old School

No cussing around Vaughn's kid without them and Ferrell takes full advantage. That scene alone makes me laugh out loud! The seat-belt scene in the cab got me off to hysterically laughing! If you haven't seen this movie you really need to. Don't ask me why just watch it! Trust me! Will Ferrell is great and Vaughn is even better.

262,brian_coty,A Decent Flick....It has its moments,6,21 June 2007,"Old School is a solid college-themed comedy. The catch is that the main characters are all grown men in their 30's seeking to relive their hard-partying days. If you're not a big ""Frat Pack"" fan (I'm Not), you probably won't consider ""Old School"" a classic, but it's still worth watching. This film has all the raunch required by its genre, but it doesn't go overboard, as many films of its kind tend to do. ""Old School"" will make you chuckle quite a bit, and even laugh-out-loud a few times, but it falls quite a bit short of ""Animal House.""Will Farrell is very good as Frank, a newly-married former party boy having a tough time adjusting to the domestic life. Most of the truly funny moments in ""Old School"" belong to Farrell. Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn also contribute good performances. Craig Kilborn and Leah Reminiare both great in more minor roles.",Old School

This movie almost touched every aspect of my life and the life of my friends. We watched it over and over again, and I would see it yet again. What I think made this movie a breakthrough in all teenage/stupid comedy was the combination of greatest actors (Will Ferrell, Luke Wilson, Vince Vaughn) and their superb play which fits together ""like a gloooove"". The main plot is interesting and somewhere original, the dialogs are smooth, we still use jokes and phrases. When watched second, third or fourth time - it's just getting better. In other words, you get the best of ""Saturday Night Live"" in one movie. I would recommend everyone to see this movie.

Farrell plays a man who suffers marital problems because he isn't mature enough, making the college life perfect for him. Vaughn is a very successful business man and refuses to fail. He takes running a fraternity very seriously which puts his marriage in jeopardy as well. The movie shows you a very stereotypical view of what college and fraternity life is. The three main characters, Wilson, Farrell, and Vaughn, start up their own fraternity so they can continue living in a house on campus. The entire process is hilarious. They have a very racially and age mixed pledge class. In order to remain as a fraternity, they are forced to pass a series of tests. This just caps the movie off and makes in immensely fun to watch.

275,JacksLackOfFaith,"Worth plenty of laughs, but falls short of greatness.",7,18 February 2003,"I saw Old School this past weekend at a sneak preview.  Personally, I was looking forward to seeing the film as I find Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn to be ""money"".  Old School turned out to be worth quite a few laughs, but it never reached what seemed like its full potential.  The story is fairly simple and follows three aging friends (Wilson, Vaugh, and WIll Ferrell) through troubled times in their lives.  To ease the suffering of middle-age the trio starts a fraternity of sorts.  The film is at its best when dealing with all the crazy stereo-typical college hijinks.  It is at its lowest when it deals with the personal lives of the three.  This does, however, help the film resonate at a more personal level, but weighs down the lighter, funnier moments.  On the big plus side there are plenty of cameos and a ROCKIN' 80's soundtrack.  Overall a good time for you and your friends. So go, have fun, see Wilson, Vaughn, and Ferrell (at the top of his game) have a blast, and put your brain on cruise. (7/10)",Old School

I honestly believe that it was cut short right in the midst of the climax. The timing in this movie was horrible as everything seemed to be coming at you at the wrong time. The main guy (Wilson, I think)... Seemed uncomfortable in his role and didn't really fit in at all, but then again nothing in this movie really 'fit'. The movie was great until they started doing what they promised they would in the previews, act like total idiots. It was something along the lines of 'The Little Rascals'-for grown-ups.

283,hangtime79,Your New Animal House,10,17 February 2003,"It seems fitting that 25 years ago we were introduced to the Delts and it took that long for a movie to equal the pure riotous laughter of the original Animal House.  Will Old School win any Oscar's or be nominated for that matter H**L No, will this film make you laugh so hard that you can't breath and make your side feel splitting pain ABSOLUTELY!  As you can probably tell from the trailers and commercials, Old School doesn't have a lot of story or character development, in fact, the story is there just to keep the gags, lines, and jokes flowing.  Oh but do the laughs come, like a busted 36 inch water main you are inundated with laughs and they don't stop. My fiancée and I were laughing so hard we couldn't catch all the dialogue so were going back to see it again.Ferrell or Vaughn steal every scene there are in, Ferrell with his brand of physical and `crazy' dude humor and Vaughn with his quick wit and one-liners.  Vaughn brings his unique fast talking, dialogue style humor to the part of Beanie, the owner of six SpeakerCitys and the father of two. Mark my words: the word `Muffs' will enter the pop culture lexicon very quickly based solely on this film and what Vaughn did with it.  Ferrell is in top form as well and fortunately for us, doesn't have the handcuffs on his performance that he has had while doing other films and SNL. Therefore you get the full Ferrell.both figuratively and literally.  Afterwards I found myself thinking that when this story was written, the roles of Frank and Beanie were written specifically for Ferrell and Vaughn because I don't believe anyone could have played them better.I chose not to include any of the jokes in this review because I cannot do them justice; you must see them for yourself.  Do I recommend this movie.ABSOLUTELY!  Will you see a funnier film this year.only if Bubbahotep from Bruce Campbell gets released, otherwise, this is the funniest thing you have ever seen.

This movie wasn't meant to be this spectacular acting performance by the actors... it's just a movie that is funny!

In all seriousness, this is just a movie that relies on silly puns, one-liners, and all that jazz that makes MOST movies funny and VERY easy to watch over and over cause there's NO plot to really follow, just one quotable joke after another.

I'm not going to say I was laughing ALL the way through it, as I don't believe any comedy does this, because like scary movies it's best to time or buildup to the funny/scary scenes.SPOILER =========================Frank the tank is just a legend, little parts like where the wedding singer blurts out the first cursing word infront of their family and friends, Franks face of amazement ""did he just say what I think he said"" type of look is awesome.END ============================Hope you enjoy the movie.",Old School

303,Kim_Vanholm,Great one!,10,4 October 2004,"Hi,I have seen the movie six times and i'm still not bored of it, every time you see it, you discover other funny things you didn't notice before.Every time when friends come to my flat, i show them old school and one of them saw it 5 times by now, i know it sounds crazy, but it's all the time laughing time if you see the movie with some friends.Character to watch is surely Frank the Tank, one of the best i ever saw. He is funny like hell, even watch he's marriage picture, streaking, frank the tank movements, the presents he give...This is must see!",Old School
304,brendanrroberts,Alright we are 9 years on and still great,10,27 July 2012,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. So when I am in Antarctica hanging out with Kiwi's and one of them shouts ""You're my boy Blue!"" after downing a shot, you know this movie is great. We didn't make it to streaking through the quad, but we talked about it. :) See it if you haven't. Also there is a 10 line minimum, which means I will tell you about a boondoggle. So it is Saturday night and I am at the bar because it is cloudy out. So I get to talking to Phil and he works in the fire department. He has never seen aurora so he wants to drive out of town to see them. But the thing is, you need a permit to get to the cool areas over the hill and see some real aurora. I actually have a permit and can take guests, so I say, yeah sure lets go. It is cloudy so I don't think we will see much. So everyone is tipsy but Phil so he drives, we get a flat tire on the way up. Have to go fix that...which was a PITA, multiple stops, like an hour in -20deg F, then we get up there, like a 2 mile drive on volcanic rock and everyone is speechless it is so amazing.",Old School
305,lyandra_hobson,The Greatest of All Time,10,13 May 2004,"This was the greatest comedy I've ever seen. Thank you Hollywood, cuz after watching such weak acts as Sweet Home Alabama, Dumb & Dumberer, LB2, etc. I was just about to turn in my comedy tastes to trade for action. But alas here came OLD SCHOOL, it was completely funny!!! and  the old dude and the fat guy in it was great icing on the cake. All the other actors were funny also, and I enjoy the streaking while Snoop Dogg was singing. I recommend EVERYONE to watch it. Its hilarious!!!!!",Old School
306,jean_mach,An hilarious comedy,10,20 May 2005,"I saw Old School yesterday night on a french channel completely by chance. I knew nothing about it. It's a wonderful movie. I hadn't laughed like this since years. The main characters are caricatures but hilarious (especially Franck the tank...), the story is completely stupid (but fantastic) and the parties these thirty year old men who don't want to grow up organize are contagious and push you to go back to university with a good beer... Some celebrities make successful appearances (Juliette Lewis, Sean William Scott...) playing completely deranged characters, adding energy and fun to this well rhythmic comedy.Old School reminds me Fight Club for the notorious ""Godfather"" as famous in this high school as Tyler Durden and a lot of incredibly funny sequences of this movie would be adopted by Monty Python themselves.And above all, Old Scholl spares us an horrible ending like : ""Well, I was a child, making mistakes, but now I understand a lot of things, honey, and I want to go back with you, our house, kids, dogs, canaries and God knows what else..."". This film remains faithful to its principles and THAT'S GREAT!! What else can I say : see this movie and be in a good mood for the rest of the day; I'm gonna see it once more now.Thank you Todd Phillips.",Old School
307,bdowney-1,Search for the Holy Grail,7,15 March 2005,"Will Ferrell typifies most middle aged men in this movie. He tries to conform with what he thinks society expects from him by getting married and buying a house and generally acting in a responsible way. Unfortunately his will persists and like a child he finds it impossible to resist temptations that we have to assume plagued his youth, hence the nickname.At times the situation comedy reaches Laurel & Hardy proportion with excellent use of sound/music and imagery. Have to say, it happens occasionally, when you see a scene in a film that causes you to double up in pain of laughter, so much so that you wonder if the scene will hold its power on repeated viewings. This film contains a scene that I continue to watch, it acts as an instant pick me up from the nonsense that can be life. Highly recommend this film for adults, its addictive like all Will Ferrells films - He has the X factor when it comes to Comedy - Good stuff Team",Old School
308,jbardal,You're my boy Blue!,8,23 September 2005,"Three friends start a fraternity to help Mitch (Luke Wilson) save his house, and even more so they can party like collage kids again. Will Farrell is great as the can't do anything right Frank 'The Tank' Richard. I loved it. Great break from any kind of thought. Vince Vaughn is easily one of the funniest men in Hollywood. Vince, Will and Luke play off each other perfectly as well as each delivering some soon to be classic lines. Even Jeremy Piven as the dean is a great addition to this movie. All the collage kids and business men in the fraternity play a big part of what makes this movie so funny. Well worth your while if you need a good laugh a real gut busting laugh.",Old School
309,shawn-hinkle71,One of the Best Comedies,10,25 January 2014,"This a classic comedy that needs to be in everyone's collection. Will and Vince are excellent in their supporting roles. From office environment to off campus life, this movie appeals to all level of society. With a bunch of cameos as well, this is a very funny and entertaining movie.Spoiler alert!One of the best screens is where Frank (Will) gets shot in the neck by Shawn Michael Scott and he stumbles around his friends daughter birthday with the dart in his neck. Ending isn't satisfying as I would like. This is one movie that deserves a sequel.",Old School
310,echv57,Funny the 10th time.,9,26 September 2018,"Will Farrell at his peak. In this day and age, it's a great return to the fun part of the recent past.",Old School
311,tadow92,"Real life ""Blue"" passed away....",10,1 January 2006,"Sad news...the actor who played 'Blue' in the movie, Patrick Cranshaw, died recently at 86. Here is the link to the article: http://entertainment.yahoo.com/entnews/ap/20051231/113609904000.html""YOU'RE MY BOY, BLUE!!!""Old School is one my favorite movies. I crack up every time I hear Will Ferrell's character singing ""Dust in the Wind"" during Blue's funeral scene. It's a damn silly movie, but funny nonetheless. Def. recommend to those looking for a good laugh without having to use their brain...just kidding...seriously, the casting is right on, and the jokes hit more times than they miss. Deserves to be mentioned w/ animal house",Old School
312,saucysteve22,Ab-Fab,10,3 July 2005,"When i first heard of this film i thought, ""oh great another piece of American teen crap with an unfunny story line and a gag an hour."" I was wrong. Not just a little wrong, but so wrong it hurts. A fantastic cast, and a storyline which had me laughing from the start to the end. Ferrell had me in stitches as usual and Vaughn and Willson were the icing on the cake. My view on this film is to watch it right now if you haven't already, and if you have, watch it again! Other films to watch: AnchormanStarsky & Hutch Zoolander",Old School
313,philstephenson175,"All the fun of college, none of the education!!",10,19 September 2005,"When Mitch (Luke Wilson Legally Blonde) catches the early flight home to surprise his girlfriend, he is the one that is surprised to find her in bed with a room full of naked strangers. Together with his two best friends Frank 'the Tank' (Will Ferrell, Saturday night live) and beanie (Vince Vaughn, Dodge Ball) they turn Mitch's new house into their very own none discriminate fraternity full of misfits and middle age dropouts. After some raging out of control antics they find themselves fighting the student dean, Pritchard, for their right to stay a fraternity.Although frank is not the main character the film you through the heart ache of frank's life and his looser style of tackling everyday life. I think that will Ferrell plays the part of frank exceptionally and so comfortably just like that is how he used to be before his big break in film. The film includes the wedding party of Frank's wedding where there is an amazingly funny rendition of 'Total Eclipse of the Heart' by an unconventional wedding singer which truly makes the song his own by adding in a few extra words for example ""when I see the f*****g look in your eye."" Also a few non-choreographed dance moves, which consist of pelvic trusts and the brandishing of the middle finger at the bride! This film takes its interest from 'Animal House' but gives the twist of the main characters being middle age. Teen is a typical teen style 'gross-out movie' that focuses on wild parties and nudity, which is also how the trouble starts for the unofficial fraternity.The way the director (Todd Philips road trip) shows that the endangered fraternity means business is by; having a shot of the stairs to the university looking up them with just the heads of the members poking over the top and walking forwards with the music gradually getting faster the camera cuts to a closer shot where most of the fraternity now in view and looking bigger. Again the camera cuts in to a close mid shot (CMS) where some of the fraternity are cut away, and again it cuts now with a close up (CU) of Mitch's head in the middle of the screen and Beanie to the left of him. Throughout this sequence the whole group are wearing the same clothes and Mitch, frank and beanie are in the centre. This achieves the desired effect because they are looking serious and not joking around.One of the most memorable scenes for me is the KY jelly-wrestling match. It gives the viewer a sense of familiarity because we have all watched wrestling at the same point or another. The oldest member of the fraternity (Blue) is faced with wrestling two very attractive top less women, in light of his age he doesn't move while the women close in on him saying 'what's up old man?' with that he collapses backwards with his feet in the air and suddenly the whole room is silent and taken by a huge gasp of disbelief. Todd Philips makes this scene funny yet shocking by having the mood lightened when the topless women stat to taunt Blue and just before he dies the camera zooms in on his face showing the fear he was feeling. The music 'dust in the wind' being sung by frank, fades in and then the picture fading while the camera slowly lowers to reveal frank in his suit singing in the graveyard with a united states Navy wreath saying Blue, and a black and white photo of a very handsome Youngman. The camera slowly zooms out and pans left showing the people that attended his funeral. The scene cuts to Mitch and beanie, beanie giving words of wisdom quietly to Mitch, the camera then cuts to the view we just left and the camera slow zooms back into frank as he finishes the song and shouts 'you're my boy Blue' which he says at the start of the fraternity.One of the 5 tasks they have to complete is an athletics competition, where the dean chooses 3 events and 3 random people to take part. In the vault event he chooses Todd. The way that director Todd Philips builds up the tension is by lining up the members of the fraternity along the run up mat, and also after inspiring words from Mitch and beanie the camera slows down just as soon as beanie slaps Todd's backside which prolongs him reach on the board the music gets stronger and faster when he hits the board it suddenly stops and all we hear is the screams of Todd as he flies through the air.Director Todd Philips thought of this movie as a comedy version of 'fight club' there (1999), and as such there are several references to fight club in the movie. References include (but are not limited to) the basement-wrestling match, the photocopying of club propaganda at work, the restaurant scene and Vince Vaughn's out fit during the initiation scene is to mimic Tyler Durden.To any one who loves to laugh this is a film that you have to see! Do what ever you can to get the chance. Get together with a group of friends and watch it, you wont regret it! 'Old School' provided me with more laughs than I've had in a long time and it never gets boring however many times I watch it. It is chock full of hilarious moments mainly at the expense of grown successful men living their wildest frat fantasies. This film is worth watching once if not more times, as it takes you through a roller-coaster of emotions each and every time, as well as making you chuckle and roll about in laughter.",Old School
314,chefnelson,Still holds up,9,12 November 2021,"Old School still holds up in my book. I was curious after so long if the jokes would still land, but Will Ferrell is on another level in this movie. The trio of Ferrell, Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn is amazing. Great flick.",Old School
315,scottjluby,0/tasteless millions found the following review useful,1,7 June 2017,"To be honest I am writing this for the (like minded) people who didn't find this movie entertaining. I sat thru this movie for a simple reason. I watched lots of films at that time. I was attending college and drank heavily, this film's key demographic. I found the whole timbre of this movie most disturbing. Most people, although yearning for their own youth, would not wish to play the naive part over again. The lead characters of this movie are strikingly unrealistic in their success despite almost no effort. They all live in nice homes, drive new cars (except for the smoking trans am, the films only good performance) and have stable lives many on this earth could only dream of. Yet we are to believe that this existence is some sort of torture for them because they can't act like drunken buffoons and belong to a fraternity? Have you ever met a women even remotely resembling this movie's stereotypes? It's as though they are trying to justify the poor treatment of them. Much comedy is based on people having the wrong reaction to normal situations. The (clearly misogynistic) writers seem to have purposely eschewed clever in favor of obnoxious. The personas portrayed are really nasty, vindictive sadists terrified of the implications of adulthood. In particular the divorce scene is beyond obtuse. The funeral scene was no picnic either. Best avoided.",Old School
316,stiles9,Best Comedy in the past 5 years.,10,15 November 2005,"This is the best comedy since Tommy Boy. Every college educated male between the ages of 25-50 knows someone just like Frank and Beanie. Absolutely hilarious. Will Farrell is perfect as Frank but Vince Vaughn steals the show. Half of everything Beanie says in this movie is just classic. The plot goes a little off towards the end, but it doesn't matter because my friends and I have been repeating some of the lines for the last 2 years. With all the really lame comedies that have come out in the past 5 years it is nice to see something that will stand the test of time- a modern Animal House. A little too cheesy towards the end but still a top 10 comedy of all time and a must own on DVD.",Old School
