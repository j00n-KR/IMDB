0,Leofwine_draca,Superficial,3,5 May 2021,"Just a pretentious art movie for me, nothing more, nothing less. Gaspar Noe is acclaimed as some kind of maverick genius but I'm failing to see that on the strength of this. A group of annoying young hedonists gather in a warehouse to dance and take a great deal of drugs, with sex and violence inevitably following. I didn't care about any of them, and the film's power to shock is lost amid the over-stylisation and superficiality of it all.",Climax
1,SnoopyStyle,experimental French dance party,6,4 February 2021,"A group of dancers has a party in an empty school. Things turn bad when their punch gets spiked. I love the energy of the dancers. There is great exuberance and they dance with abandon. It took about fifteen minutes before I realized that the movie isn't cutting. I assumed it for the rest of the movie and then it changed again. I wish they go for broke and do the movie in one take.It's hard to concentrate on any main character. Sofia Boutella is probably the only noteworthy actor. Some of the others could do more. It's the filming style. They're not allowed to hold the screen and being non-actors, they can't grab it for themselves. Maybe they are better off as an amorphous mob. Again, that would work better as a single take.",Climax
2,Horst_In_Translation,"As in your face as always with the director, deep down into the artistic abyss",6,13 December 2018,"""Climax"" is an award-winning 2018 film and the newest work by writer and director Gaspar Noé from Argentina, but yeah his works are almost always in the French language and so is this one here. French film buffs will probably recognize more cast members than I did during these almost 100 minutes. The only name familiar to me is Sofia Boutella and she plays also the character that is closest to be a main protagonist and probably has more screen time than everybody else in here. But it is an ensemble piece for sure. This is about a group of young dancers practicing in a snowed-in house in no man's land somewhere, but quickly ending the practice and moving on to party hard afterward after a bit of talk. And this is where the film gains steam really and becomes as excessive as you would expect it from a Noé movie. It is very graphic again, this time more in terms of violence than in terms of sexuality. For example we have a relatively young child take a drink from sangria that is laced with acid and we hear him suffer afterward, perhaps die even. It is not 100% clear as we only hear him behind a thick wall. And a young pregnant woman is kicked and punched several times in the stomach, which was most painful for me to watch. Still, there are some boobs visible, but yeah that is all really apart from some making out. We also see said woman cutting herself deep with a knife in her arms and also her face, which I found surprising as I could have expected this reaction had she taken from the LSD drink too, but she didn't, so yeah did not make that much sense to me. Then again, what is supposed to make sense in a Noé movie!?It is all about the style and the immediate reactions you are experiencing to what you see on screen. Which can be extreme. And if you have seen some stuff from Noé like ""Irréversible"" of course, then you will know that he is not a great fan of chronology and this is also true here, especially very early on, even if it is more chronological than most other stuff from him. Tough to watch at times for sure with the scenes I mentioned earlier, but if you manage to stomach them and sit through them, then you will be rewarded with a pretty good film. It's not my favorite film by Noé, but I enjoyed it. The longer the film goes, the less important it also becomes who laced the LSD in fact, so it is never really a crime movie, even if there are indicators it could have been Boutella's character at the very end. I liked the reference back to the beginning when we see somebody drugging herself through her eyes, something another character has described very early in the movie and yeah watching it is far more intense than just hearing it. Besides, pay attention to the films shown very early on when we hear those interviews with all the characters. Anyway, another aspect I finally want to mention is how this film can be seen as a parallel to sex, with how it all starts and moves slowly towards the ecstatic (drug-induced) climax before at the very end, there is the silence, the calming down, the resting, even the (little) death for one, no two characters I believe. I don't think this is a coincidence, but it is something you may want to experience yourself and think about it. While I did enjoy the film for the most part, it is not one I would want to watch soon again in the near future. But I do give it a thumbs-up and recommend checking it out. To grown-ups only though. Noé delivered again, even if I did not like it as much as the raters here on imdb did and also not as much as critics loved it, even if it certainly oozes creativity frequently. Go see it, preferably on the big screen.",Climax
3,kosmasp,Influenced by ...,8,12 February 2019,"This is not an easy watch. And while Climax may suggest this to be very sexual or at least sensual, you might be dissapointed if you're looking for that kind of ""satisfaction"". The choreography of the dancing is really good, the cinematography is something to behold too. If you don't mind long uninterrupted shots that is of course.This is about addiction, about people driven to go the extra mile and about people hoarded in a secluded location going ""nuts"" as some might describe it. And as a different reviewer wrote: this is an experience. It will split a lot of people as it did at the various festivals it played. This is not an ordinary movie, but when has Noe done that? So if you are aware of his body of work, you at least know not to expect something ""normal"". Now some have stated, that if you had experience with certain drugs, you may understand or ""enjoy"" this experience more than others. I can't talk to that, not having had that experience. I can say though that this is quite rough to watch. Especially when things spiral downwards ...Still very enticing and tension filled. Technically almost flawless it will depend what you make of the ""story"" or rather the excuse of one to get the viewer to go on a ... well ""trip""!",Climax
4,jboothmillard,Climax,7,11 March 2021,"I found this French scary movie when it was shown on Film4, I found it was rated the full five out of five stars, I had never heard of it before, but I was intrigued to see what it would be like, directed by Gaspar Noé (Irreversible, Love). Basically, it opens with a series of audition tapes of interviewed potential future members of a dance troupe being created by choreographer Selva (Sofia Boutella) and DJ Daddy (Kiddy Smile). They discuss topics like dancing, their fears, relationships, sex, and drug experiences. One night during the winter season in 1996, in an abandoned school, the chosen dancers rehearse an elaborate routine. They then start an after-party, with further dancing and they drink sangria made by the troupe manager, Emmanuelle (Claude Gajan Maull). The diverse group of dancers have several personal issues and gossip about each other during the celebration. As the party continues, the dancers become increasingly agitated and confused. Someone realises that the sangria has been spiked with LSD. Initially, Emmanuelle is accused as she made the drink. Taylor (Taylor Kastle), who is resentful towards Omar (Adrien Sissoko) for dating his sister Gazelle (Giselle Palmer), then accuses non-drinker Omar of being the one responsible. The group gets angry and locks him outside the building in freezing conditions. Emmanuelle sees her young son Tito (Vince Galliot Cumant), who is present, drinking the sangria and locks him in an electric room for his protection from the others. Selva takes her friend Lou (Souheila Yacoub) into a room where she admits to not drinking because she is pregnant. Other members of the group soon become aggressive, including Dom (Mounia Nassangar) who kicks Lou in the stomach, accusing her of spiking the drink. There is in altercation between Alaia (Alaïa Alsafir) and Jennifer (Sarah Belala), during which Jennifer's hair is set on fire and she is physically hurt by Alaia for not sharing cocaine. A frenzied Lou grabs a knife, the group turns on her, accusing her of spiking the drink, until she suffers a breakdown and cuts herself on the face and arm with the knife after the group encourage her to kill herself. Emmanuelle, who has accidentally locked Tito in the electric room, and realises he has electrocuted himself, when the school's power suddenly cuts off. Ivana (Sharleen Temple) and a heavily hallucinating Selva enter a room to take shelter and have sex. David (Romain Guillermic) discovers the two and is kicked out and is also kicked out of a room by DJ Daddy. Rejected, David encounters Gazelle as her brother, Taylor, attempts to have sex with her. Gazelle flees from Taylor and stumbles into the central hall where the remaining dancers have truly lost their minds, dancing, writhing on the floor, chanting in tongues, having sex with one another, or beating each other up. Taylor catches up to Gazelle and while David is attacked by another dancer who slams his head against the floor. When police arrive the next morning, they find most of the dancers unconscious. Omar has frozen to death outside while Emmanuelle has killed herself grieving the death of her son. Gazelle wakes up next to Taylor, seemingly having forgotten the evening. A bloody Lou exits the building, and steps outside in snow laughing uncontrollably. As the police search the building, it is revealed that Psyché (Thea Carla Schøtt)) spiked the drink, as she has books related to hallucinogens in her bag, is seen dropping drugs into her eyes. The cast of mostly unknowns all do fine, the dance routines are brilliantly choreographed, I liked the frank discussions in the script, the camerawork is inventive, the use of lighting and colour adds to the ever-increasingly dark atmosphere at the controversial disco, the visuals with moments of violence and sex are eye-catching, and the soundtrack of songs (including Daft Punk and Soft Cell) is good, overall, it is a fairly chilling and intriguing psychological horror. Very good!",Climax
5,ferguson-6,hypnotic or horrific depending on your taste,5,15 March 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. A wounded, bleeding, hysterical woman is seen crawling through the snow. She's not dressed appropriately for the weather, and it's apparent she's suffered some type of trauma. This opening shot is from a bird's eye view, and it's the way provocative filmmaker Gaspar Noe (LOVE, ENTER THE VOID) opens his latest film. This vivid visual sticks with us as we flashback to the progression of events that led to this woman's unfortunate circumstance ... her situation being the conclusion to what we are about to watch.The initial dance sequence is shown in full and it is quite stunning in its energy and physicality and athleticism. As best I could tell, it was a single long take with dancers writhing and music thumping, both in frenetic mode. Much of each dancer's personality is depicted in their movements, and the video interviews we see as part of their audition reveal a culturally diverse group of young adults unsure of where this is headed. We are watching a troupe of mid-1990's French dancers rehearsing in a large, otherwise empty facility on a snowy night, and we too are unprepared for what's about to unfold.After that initial performance, the dancers begin mingling as the camera takes us inside the various conversations. Lust, jealousy, and insecurities fill the air as the choreographed energy we first watched in awe slowly disintegrates into a bizarre type of hand-to-hand combat ... some psychological, some more physical/violent in nature. The dancers are slipping from sanity, unsure if it's temporary or possibly deadly. One of them traces their spinning head (not literal) and unexplained sensations to the Sangria punch - leading to some angry confrontations and outrageous behavior.While none of the individual performances really stand out ... this is not a film about certain interesting characters ... it should be noted that Sofia Boutella (HOTEL ARTEMIS) plays Selva, the dance company's choreographer, and Kiddy Smile plays Daddy, the DJ who keeps the music pumping. Watching the movie is truly like observing a group acid trip through the eyes of someone on an acid trip. The camera is sometimes invading intimate moments, while other times hovering or wildly spinning above or below. Sometimes it felt like a GoPro was strapped to a frantic parakeet that had just been set free from its cage.Combining the camera work with the constant thundering of music, some might describe the film as hypnotic and hallucinatory (I prefer horrific).
While most of the dancers seem to lose all sense of reality, some react more violently than others. Hysterics run rampant, especially in a sequence where a young boy is locked in a utility closet by his mother. Whether the scene was for shock value or merely in keeping with the filmmaker's demented approach is unclear - either way, this came across as too much on top of too much. Simply put, the film is a relentless assault on the eyes and ears and all sense of decency ... just as Gaspar Noe likely intended.",Climax
6,deloudelouvain,"Gaspar Noé, a name you won't forget once you watched one of his movies.",7,14 February 2019,"Climax is not a movie for everyone, and that becomes clear when you read the reviews that go from excellent to bad, but you got to give it to director Gaspar Noé, he can make provocative movies like no one else can. But not only the provocative aspect of the movie is interesting but also and mostly the way of filming his subjects. It's all very weird and special, a visual fest for the eyes. The story is quite simple but effective and that's all due to the strange ambiance that reigns throughout the whole movie. Seul Contre Tous is still Gaspar Noé's best work, at least to me, but with Irréversible and now Climax he showed everybody that he's a natural talent and that his movies make people talk about it. I can't wait for the next Gaspar Noé movie, as I'm always curious what it will be this time.",Climax
7,christopher-underwood,I am not part of the intended audience,6,13 April 2019,"I find that the brutal and garish style of Gasper Noe has little appeal and I have thus far only watched some excerpts and a couple of early shorts. Understanding that this might have a greater appeal, I gave it a watch. The confrontational beginning with unappealing youths was not a promising start and though the subsequent dance routines were impressive I couldn't help feeling that combined with the thunderous 90s dance music accompaniment this was my idea of hell. An hour later into this plotless extravaganza, those same 'dance' routines are replayed as death throes in an, admittedly very well filmed, modern version of Dante's Inferno. There is considerable directorial skill here but clearly I am not part of the intended audience. My only pleasurable moment, ironically, was when the police arrive to poke about the dead bodies and we have an instrumental version of the Rolling Stones, Angie. A moment of bliss amidst a mass of agonised death wish.",Climax
8,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - Climax (2018) 6.2/10,6,16 December 2020,"""In CLIMAX, Noé the enfant terrible again goes to extremes in mapping out his psychedelic nightmare, the plot is simple, 20 or so dancers are rehearsing in an abandon school, after drinking the sangria spiked with LSD (a supposition is never confirmed and the perpetrator is never divulged, or only implied in the end, but for what intention? Perhaps just for the hell of it?). Again substances are frugal but Noé's visual and sonic outpourings are all over the place. Anyone of those swaggering, krumping, twerking and contorting dancers (inclusivity is well handled) can justly get a cattle call in a STEP UP movie and its umpteenth copy cats, only their terpsichorean aptitude cannot take the edge off their feather-headedness, and their small talks (again improvised) are monotonous (all sex-oriented), inconsequential and exhausting, any attempt of characterization is foiled by the wooden performances of these professional danseurs and danseuses. The only exception is Sofia Boutella, who nerves herself to do a hysterical tribute to Isabelle Adjani in Andrzej Zulawski's POSSESSION (1981), only her madness remains skin deep.""read my full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",Climax
9,thesar-2,"Dance, Drugs and Dialogue",4,19 October 2019,"(Quickie Review.) This very indie arthouse film reminds me a lot of Nicolas Cage's Mandy, in which, it's wacko, I didn't fully absorb it this first time and I absolutely need to see it again. Maybe, with a lot less alcohol.
It starts off with an extreme amount of DANCING (which, truthfully, I really enjoyed) and then follows with LONG dialogue scenes between multiple parties (the dancers) in a dance studio on day three of their training. ANNND repeat. It was Dance, Dialogue, Dance, Dialogue, over and over. But, mercifully, someone remembered there had to a plot inserted and it got interesting. I do understand this movie, as crazy as it was, but admittedly, some day I'm going to have to do a double feature between this and Mandy to fully embrace the ""art.""",Climax

11,nairtejas,MAMI Review: Climax (7 Stars),7,1 November 2018,"There is so much energy in Gaspar Noe's Climax that I wanted to jump out of my seat and start dancing to the beats of the continuously humming techno soundtrack. Sadly, my fellow audience wouldn't have let me, but deep inside I believe that if I actually did, they would have only joined me. Such is the power of Noe's beautiful, philosophical, and insane techno-dance thriller that hypnotizes from the first frame itself through its immensely talented actors to the anti-climactic credits placement and shots of textual philosophical one-liners to eventually the conveyance of the moral of the short story. The story about a group of French dancers practicing in an old abandoned school premises for an upcoming tournament so that they can compete with the Yankees and show who rules the dancing world takes an ugly turn when the idiosyncratic characters - not one as same as the other - find out that their cocktail was laced with LSD by someone. Who? Why? These questions is in everyone's mind, but the music never stops and no one is in their right mind to sit and think and investigate. And by the time director Noe ends the shots - most of which are single takes - you realize that what you are seeing in front of you is the definition of intoxication and its consequences in its purest form. Climax is true madness and it will blow you away with its truthfulness. TN.(Watched and reviewed at its India premiere at the MAMI Mumbai Film Festival.)",Climax
12,The-Sarkologist,Who Spiked the Punch?,9,16 October 2020,"Okay, it's not punch, it's sangria, which means that it is already alcoholic, and it isn't like somebody pours a bottle of vodka into it just to get everybody drunk, it is more like somebody decides to pour a whole heap of LSD into it, and sits back and watches what happens. Well, not quite, and I'm sort of wondering if you can actually do that, but a quick search reveals that people do, and get into trouble doing it as well. Well, let's just say that everybody at the party ends up having a really, really bad trip, which is probably what happens when you end up taking LSD and not realising that you are taking it.Look, this film is certainly not everybody's cup of tea, and it is pretty horrific in places actually. Then again I think that is the point that the director is trying to make - the whole idea about losing control of your mind, and being incapable of taking control of it again, which is apparently one of the side effects of LSD. In fact Noe does a pretty awesome job of capturing the psychological horror of the situation, and he makes it even more intense by literally filming half of the film in one shot, which means that you will be following different people around, and when they interact with another person the camera will start following them.So, we have this dance troupe which is rehearsing for a production that they plan on putting on, and the first part of the film has them performing, and I must admit that the performance is nothing short of awesome. There are also scenes where we are introduced to each of the characters, and there are quite a few of them, and then we have conversations between them, and an interesting thing is that a lot of these conversations were ad-libbed. In fact, apparently most of the cast had no acting ability whatsoever (though they were all dancers).Then somebody realises that something is wrong, and they also realise that the sangria has been spiked, and suspect that it is LSD. This is where pretty much everything descends in to utter chaos. It is as if pretty much everybody loses control of themselves, and either dive into an orgy of sexuality, recriminations, and violence. The picture Noe paints is not a pretty picture, and as the madness deepens, so does the chaos of the situation, until you reach a point where you really don't know what is going on. In a way, Noe seems to be trying to draw us, the viewer, into the madness, and I feel that he does so very successfully. In fact, the swaying of the camera in part is designed to capture some nausea that no doubt comes about from drug induced hazes.Is there a body count? Yep, there certainly is, though we generally don't know who has died and who hasn't. Some we are pretty certain of, others we are quite unsure. We do know who ended up sleeping together, though of course there is some ambiguity about that as well. This is intentional. It is also interesting to see how people make snap decisions, and are then unable to see the repercussions of their actions - it is as if the drug has taken control of their minds, and once they decide on something, they cannot see reason, and then cannot move from the point of view that they had adopted.One could say that this is a microcosm of our society, and the recriminations that abound, as baseless as they are, mimic the recriminations that we as people make, and the blindness that we have to the other viewpoints. In a way it is as if somebody has spiked our drinks, and once we have made a decision, we are incapable of saying that we are wrong, and as such we push through to the inevitable conclusion.Yeah, this film was pretty awesome, and pretty disturbing, yet a part of me feels that it is definitely rewatchable.",Climax
13,ops-52535,get engulfed by the madness,6,7 February 2019,"Climax is one of the film i wish i had turned of, because it draws you through the wide spectre of human emotions. there are no coherence in what you see and may expect. its light ,its music,its hysteria,its madness,its dance,its movements, its noise ,its grief, it sucks you in by mesmerizing dancing, then youre turmoiled in the washing machine, then trown in the drier, and thereafter youre squezed trough the clothing roller, and you come out clean and plain , promising never to use LSD once again......its a french production, and french is kauderwelsh to me, so i feel like missing out some of the nuances that languageunderstanding gives.what really lured me in was the extreme dancing parts, especially the ensemble set up in the start of the film. i think i will replay that 6 minute section again and again just to analyse and to absorbe every movement done by the actors, because you get tunnelvision when watching it ,drawing the attention to the centerpart of the screen.at this point the film is worth 100 stars.but from there it starts to implode and end up with 6 stars as my final rating. i may insult those who admire ''a clockwork orange'', but '' climax'' is a film that makes the same level of sense , its senseless and weird. i will recommend it for its first half, because it made the grumpy old man dance on the sofa......",Climax

15,eddie_baggins,A headtrip of a movie unlike anything else,6,23 June 2019,"Renowned for his uncomfortable viewing experiences and boundary pushing narratives, Argentinian filmmaker Gaspar Noé is undoubtedly one of the most unique directors working in the industry today, with his bizarre and off-putting Climax well and truly likely to please diehard fans of the auteur.Arguably his most accessible film yet (not a hard task when up against Love, Irreversible and Enter the Void) but also entirely the opposite to mainstream film-making, Climax may be billed as some type of horror experience and while there are horrific moments of shock value and unexpected occurrences, Climax is more of a fever dream of a film, that when combined with its off-putting structure and often dizzying feats of camerawork, creates an experience that is hard to pin down in words.Confined in its duration to a French dance school that is hosting a collection of bright up and coming stars, who after days of hard work are looking to party the night away, only to find that their Sangria punch may not be the wisest choice of beverage, Climax takes its time to unravel its true identity as Noé feels no need to rush to get to the craziness that lays in wait, eager to take us off our guard and open our eyes.There's a large group of performers for us to meet here, with Sofia Boutella's Selva what you'd call the films lead and all performers acquit themselves well to Noé's kooky affair, that's highlights include a number of impressive dance sequences that are both energetic and hypnotic while oddly terrifying and the films opening 40 - 50 minutes allows us to spend our time getting to observe and overhear these various characters interact with one another, blissfully unaware of what lays in store for them.The horror, oddities and general all-round craziness that does come as the film rockets along to its ""climax"" is what lets Noé's experience down, as while things are constantly keeping you wrong-footed and second guessing, there's no genuine amazing revelations or sequences that bring what's come before to full circle.In some weird way it feels as though Climax could've gone further with some of its half-baked scenarios, plot-threads and horrors as you keep expecting the ""big"" moment to come but with all that had come before, including its quite thrilling opening segment, Climax ends with a whimper not with a bang.Final Say -Hard to describe in words, Climax is a totally unique and often dizzying experience that once more confirms Noé's stature as a one-off talent but despite all its promise and teases, Climax never quite gets to payoff we think is coming our way.3 power supply boxes out of 5",Climax

20,paul-allaer,"Truly ""way out there"" experimental film",6,18 March 2019,"""Climax"" (2018 release from France; 96 min.) brings the story of a dance troupe. As the movie opens, a choreographer is interviewing each of them to get more personal background information. We then switch to a rehearsal, where we see the dancers perform as classic dance tunes of Cerrone and Patrick Hernandez are thundering. As the rehearsal concludes, the dancers start talking to one another, while most of them drink lots of sangria. The stories become gossipy rather quickly... At this point we are less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from noted experimental French director/editor Gaspar Noe. Here he brings to the big screen a story inspired by true events that took place in France in 1996, as we are reminded by the movie's opening credits. When I see the term ""inspired"", I translate that as ""very loosely based on, with lots of artistic licensing, just because"". The movie is really two films in one: the rehearsal and its immediate aftermath, and then the transition into personal hell for these dancers. The film was made on a very small budget and with little to no prior dancing experience by the cast. Oh, and did I mention that the movie's opening dance rehearsal and subsequent conversation comes in one long shot of about 15 min.? And that there are subsequent single shots that run even longer? Yea, it's kinda like that. The contrast between the movie's opening scenes and the last 15 min. or so couldn't be further apart mood-wise (and screaming-wise). There is a ferocity in these acting performances that are bound to unsettle some (they sure did unsettle me). Bottom line: this is a movie that is truly ""way out there"", but not without its merits (I don't really want to use the word ""charming"" as that is really the exact opposite of what this movie is). Last but not least, there is a ton of great dance music featured throughout the movie (Cerrone, Patrick Hernandez, Giorgio Moroder, Soft Cell, and on and on).""Climax"" premiered at last year's Cannes film festival and finally opened in US theaters this month. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at my art-house theater here in Cincinnati, was attended dismally (5 people, including myself), and I'd be surprised if this plays more than one week. If you are in the mood for a weird cocktail of dance and talk and all hell breaks loose, all with a French twist, then by all means I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater (not very likely at this point), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",Climax
21,subxerogravity,It was a spectacular movie with a great beat.,7,15 March 2019,"It was that beat that made everything consistent as Climax successfully attempts to mix up the format of a narrative and toss us off a bit.(For some reason) set in the mid-90s (Maybe because this type of House music was really popular during this time),a dance troop being assembled for some music event are getting their groove on when someone spikes the punch with some LSD, which has a bizarre variety of effects on the group. It's like an Urban Legend come true.Surprisingly, there is not as many dance segments in the film as I would think, tidbits here and there but not flooded with it, but that score was impressive, and had me bumping. It's like the film composer was a DJ just spinning the sounds of Daft Punk (and a few other dudes from that house era that I'm not going to pretend to know). Maybe that is what happen because that's what it overall felt like.I think the movie was cast with french dancers (Not actors). The only one I knew was Sofia Boutella, who had supporting roles in some great action movies like the Kingsmen and Atomic Blonde (She was also in Star Trek Beyond) Not much acting was needed, the filmmaker just turned the camera on some of these kids and just let them talk naturally (or at least that's what it seems like cause, you know, I don't speak french). There was actually more talk than there was dance, before the movie got really odd with the heavy trip.I've never done LSD myself and in fairness, these kids seem to have done so much in one dose that I'm surprise the film was not far more crazy than it actually was.A simple story made interesting by a kinetic flow to the narrative, sexy people in motion, and a full proof plan to make sure you cannot just up an leave without sitting though the list of everyone credited in making the film.Nice!",Climax
22,jadavix,They should have spiked it sooner,7,11 March 2019,"Gaspar Noé's ""Climax"" is a rarity in that it is a movie that does exactly what it says it will, and really nothing more, nothing less. If you are reading this you probably already know what it's about, even if you haven't seen it yet: a group of French dancers meet in a remote location to rehearse, and realise too late that the ""sangria"" they have all been drinking is spiked with LSD.Their behaviour gets increasingly crazy, in some cases attacking each other and themselves. In one instance a woman is accidentally set on fire, though typically Noé's camera doesn't follow her.Eventually they all just end up gibbering wrecks on the floor.If the movie has any serious problem, however, it's how long it takes to get going. More than half the movie is spent with these characters just talking, and their conversations are dull. It's not until over half way in that the drugs start to take hold. Before that, these characters aren't interesting enough. I don't know if you're supposed to care about them or not, but I certainly didn't.",Climax
23,Stevieboy666,Barf bag recommended,6,12 February 2021,"A group of dancers are gathered in a former school in 1996, they dance and party but the Sangria has been spiked with LSD and a horrible nightmare unfolds. I really enjoy modern French cinema, the films often push the boundaries and Climax is one such movie. I found it to be clever and very well made, but at the same time it was also hard to watch, not a pleasant experience. The camerawork is fantastic, the camera flows and uses many angles, including upside down giving the impression that people are walking on the ceiling. This, plus the dance music, is a relentless assault on the senses. The dancing is very good and I felt that the actors put a lot into their performances, both on and off the dance floor. There is a great deal of very explicit sex talk, I felt that this was unnecessary, we have some incest too just to add to the shock value, plus a girl urinates whilst stood on the dance floor in front of everybody. Add to that drug taking, violence and some explicit self harm, this isn't exactly family entertainment! Difficult movie for me to review, I was both impressed and repulsed at the same time. In my younger days when I went out drinking some nights my head would start spinning in bed as soon as I shut my eyes to go to sleep, not a nice sensation - watching Climax had a similar effect!",Climax
24,drownnnsoda,A funhouse of horrors,9,24 October 2021,"In 1996 France, a dance troupe gathers for a rehearsal in abandoned school, practicing for an upcoming performance. After the rehearsal is complete, they hold an after-party that descends into complete madness when the dancers find their celebratory sangria has been spiked with LSD.With ""Irreversible"" as my only point of reference for Gaspar Noé, I was bracing myself for something extraordinary, and ""Climax"" delivered. What is perhaps so interesting about it is that Noé takes a simple (albeit odd) premise and blows it up to extreme proportions. That no ordinary mind would ever cultivate. Dance enthusiasts will find the first twenty minutes particularly enthralling, though I personally found the interpersonal drama that follows to be much more involving.Stylistically, the film is made up of long, continuous takes that follow the characters as they begin to descend into their own personal drug-induced hells. The interchange between them happens as they pass one another while ambling around the abandoned school, and there is a naturalistic flow to how this is all presented. What is particularly harrowing is that the audience sees this all unfold from an objective point of view, and we are never allowed the characters' warped, hallucinogenic perspective--we simply see anxieties and tensions rise, resulting in dire consequences. The abandoned school, which is already atmospheres enough, morphs into a complete and utter funhouse of horrors.Made up of mostly non-actors, the cast delivers realistic performances that are likely successful because of the improvisational nature of the production, and the cinematography is appropriately mind-bending. Those who have derided this film for having ""no plot"" are truly missing the point. This is not your typical narrative film--it is more a fleeting snapshot of the world crashing down on a group of people. There is a tangible sense of helplessness here, leaving the film feeling, at times, like a meditation on the tenuous grasp we have on our lives. We are in control, of course, until we are not. 9/10.",Climax
25,kluseba,Homo homini lupus,9,13 March 2019,"Caspar Noé's latest movie Climax is an experimental combination of a musical, drama and horror film.Climax is a musical because it revolves around a group of young French dancers who get prepared for their new show over the course of three days in an abandoned school building. The movie starts with interview sections as the different dancers talk about their motivations to join the group. The second scene shows the elaborate dance choreography. The third scene is the party after the last practice when you can see the characters dance to electronic music. The entire first quarter of the film focuses on dance moves and electronic music to portray how the characters express themselves artistically.The movie slowly shifts towards a drama. Someone has poisoned the sangria with LSD and the dancers start acting erratically, emotionally and aggressively. We observe a brother who overprotects his younger sister who is longing for more independence. We get to know that one of the female dancers is pregnant and she doesn't know who the father of her child could be. We come across a nervous mother who is desperately trying to protect her son from the dancers.The film ends as a horror movie as the situation escalates. Prejudice, rape and murder occur as the drugs bring out the worst in each and every single character. The film's second half and especially its final third are certainly hard to digest. This movie should only be watched by adults with an open mind and a strong stomach.The cinematography of the film needs to be pointed out. There are almost no cuts as the camera randomly follows characters throughout the fateful night which gives the movie a quite fluid vibe. The fact that the movie values music and movements over an actual plot or even dialogues is also particularly outstanding. The film starts with the credits, introduces chapters like silent movies used to do and the camera sometimes turns around to portray a world that has been shaken upside down.As nightmarish as the film might seem, Climax is actually based upon true events. Without pointing fingers, the movie certainly includes a lot of social criticism. It shows how partners, friends and even family members turn against each other once a drug has eliminated their self-control. The film also uses a lot of stereotypes that may be shocking at first contact but that turn out being more realistic that one might be willing to admit. It leads the viewers to question their societies and their values.In the end, Climax is a mindblowing experience unlike any other film. It's not easy to digest because of its explicit violence, thin plot and absence of dialogues but the aesthetic aspect, vibrant atmosphere and underlying messages pardon for its minor flaws. If you are an adult, have an open mind and strong stomach and like experimental cinema, this might become one of your very favourite movies.",Climax

29,Agent10,"Toxic, wild and visceral",7,24 September 2021,"Having been an admirer of Gaspar Noe's work, this has to be the most accessible of his work. So yeah, if this movie did not really appeal to you, you are probably not gonna like his other work.Noe is quite a polarizing figure in cinema, for you will either find his work interesting or find it banal....and this is a film by film basis. Critics will have a hard time judging this against Noe's other films, pro-drug advocates will hate the unfair representation of LSD, and of course identity politics gatekeepers will accuse the film of portraying toxic homosexual characters as no different than toxic heterosexual people. Regardless, not everything is uniform in this world.Anyway, what makes this film unique amongst the current pantheon of cinema is the fact Noe once again heavily relied on non-professional actors, scant scripting and even fewer camera movements and cuts. It has all the hallmarks of his past work, only this story took an incredibly dark turn and we were also going to witness the aftermath.I don't recommend Gaspar Noe's films to people unless they are used to watching this type of cinema. So yeah, if you want to expand your mind....start with this one in Noe's library. If you wanna keep watching simple comic book movies, this might not be for you.",Climax
30,Reviews_of_the_Dead,"Wild, Hallucinatory Nightmare",8,15 March 2019,"This was a film that I heard about when it was making its festival rounds and it had me intrigued. Podcasts I listen to gave some non-spoiler reviews and from what I gathered, it had been kind of hit or miss with those I listen to. That first viewing was in the theater where I thought it was solid. I'm now giving it a second viewing as part of the Summer Series for The Podcast Under the Stairs. To get into this, the synopsis is French dancers gather in a remote, empty school building to rehearse on a wintry night. The all-night celebration morphs into a hallucinatory nightmare when they learn their sangria is laced with LSD.We kick this off with a woman walking through what looks to be snow. She is screaming and the film then informs us that this is based on real events that happened in France back in 1996. The film also interestingly enough follows this up with the full credits before shifting to interviews of all of the dancers that are in the film. They are asked similar questions and it is quite quick, but we really get an idea of each of their characters. This is further done when we see them breaking off into pairs to tell more about themselves or to make comments about other dancers.In between the television interviews and them breaking off is an impressive performance. This is actually the rehearsal they are there for. I'll be the first to admit, I'm not great at dancing and I really don't understand how people can move this way, but this was fun to watch. At the end of the performance, there is food and drinks for everyone to unwind and celebrate. The problem is that the sangria is laced with LSD. We then see the people as they start to experience their trip as they go for their carnal desires, blame those around them for spiking the drink and a lot of madness. We see the truth of each of the characters as this becomes a psychedelic nightmare.I wanted to keep this recap short as this film doesn't really have a lot to it without spoiling different things. What I mean there is that I'd be going through different 'events' piece by piece. I found it interesting that I read this film really didn't have a script. What they had was about 5 pages to start it off and the rest of it was improvised. I do find this to be quite impressive. The film also feels very Hitchcockian as it has extremely long takes and it feels like it all one continuous shot at different times. It is able to do this as characters move around the perspective as it jumps to follow what the next person is doing. This involves some good rehearsal and interesting camera work.This film has an arthouse way of telling this story as well. The issue of abortion is raised as a character thinks they could be pregnant. We see that this bothers Selva (Sofia Boutella). I believe she is talking to Lou (Souheila Yacoub). There is a flash of a message that birth is a miracle. There are a couple more of these that existence is a fleeting illusion and death is also a magical thing as well. This commentary plays out later in a horrific way. Lou is bullied and we also see something happen with Emmanuelle (Claude-Emmanuelle Gajan-Maull) and her son Tito (Vince Galliot Cumant).We also get a lot about sexuality. David (Romain Guillermic) is a player and he admits to it. Others around him know it too, but he still on the prowl. He his sights set on Selva, who he claims to have hooked up with before, as well as a lesbian couple of Psyche (Thea Carla Scott) and Ivana (Sharleen Temple). He does admit he would hook up with any of the women that are there. There are a couple of guys who also talk about how they work as a team to hook-up with women. I know one goes by Cyborg (Alexandre Moreau) and I think his cousin is Naab (Naab). I find this interesting that they are open about their sexuality and what they are looking for. It is misogynistic though in some of the things they say. Along with the lesbian couple, there are also some gay men as well, which their plight I found intriguing with the other men around. One of them is named Daddy (Kiddy Smile) and I think the other is Taylor (Taylor Kastle). On top of that, there is the concept of rape, incest and a horrible parent as well that is explored.I will admit though, I did have some issues with the pacing of the film. It takes entirely took long in my opinion before we get into it. I'm come to realize that we need it though. We get the two sections of interviews to get an idea of the characters before things go wild. I thought it was solid once the LSD starts to kick in and we see the craziness happening. Part of this is the amount of characters and the director trying to introduce and let us get to know everyone. I'll be honest that I don't know the names of most of the cast and it took this second viewing to piece this together. I did like how things end up once we get to the climax of this film.Despite me not being able to tell you who all of the characters are, I thought the acting was good. I was a big fan of Boutella and I liked when her character was the focus. I should point out; this film doesn't have a star per say we follow. It shifts around to everyone in this film at one point or another. I'd say that the movie does well in giving us enough of each and following different interactions to build tension. We have enough different personalities to make this film work.This brings me to the effects. For the most part, there aren't a lot used. I wasn't sure since I know that Gaspar Noé films I've seen in the past can be quite brutal. We do get some of that. There is a scene with someone being set on fire that I liked. I think the bigger thing would be the camera work. We don't get the screen going too crazy to show the effects of the drugs, but there is some good lighting. We also get the camera showing us things upside down, which is a solid allegory to what the drug is doing to them. I have to give credit for these aspects.Next would be the score of the film. I thought the music selections were amazing for this film. It isn't necessarily my type of music, but it fits the film in multiple ways. First is the dance performance, which matches perfectly. Then once everything starts to go crazy, the music becomes haunting. When characters leave the room it is playing, it is quieter, but that almost makes it a bit unnerving. I have to give a lot of credit for the soundtrack for this film, especially since it got my heart rate going with anxiety.Now with that said, during our set-up of the movie, it can feel a bit boring. That is needed though to get you introduced to our players. Once we get to the craziness, I was locked in and there might have been more than once that I was shocked by something I saw. I thought this film had good acting and it does have a solid build up once we really get into it. The effects, how it was shot and soundtrack were great. There were some choices by Noé that weren't necessarily needed in the film, but this is a solid hallucinatory nightmare like the synopsis said. I found this film to be above average after this both viewings though.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10.",Climax

' Love ' was bad enough, but ' Climax ' is perhaps the most horrible film I have ever seen, and that is not a come on for those who want to see life as horror, but to warn viewers that this film could hurt the mind and the senses badly. It is, it is said, based on real events; a dance event that starts off with the usual frenzy of youthful bodies frantically dancing to the limit and ending up due to a spiced drink in separate worlds of unspeakable terror. Is it even good as film ? In my opinion, no, but others have the right to believe otherwise. I feel sick at heart that cinema has sunk so low, and Noe in this new wave at what I call ' atrocity cinema ' is not alone in France at making such nihilistic films. It is the sort of film that makes me want to cease reviewing film and I never thought I would say that.",Climax
33,aciessi,Art House Party,7,14 October 2020,"I have a love-hate relationship with Gaspar Noe. Actually, it's more like a tolerate-hate relationship. As an art house filmmaker, his visuals are stunning to look at. But the films themselves have offered very little meaning to me. They range from pretentious, to downright unwatchable. Climax, however, is an exception. This is Gasper Noe's best film. Despite having a completely minimal story, it sets it's goal and achieves it brilliantly. A group of dancers meet up one night and overdose on LSD after drinking laced sangria. That's it. That's the film. It doesn't beat around the bush, or tries to be something it isn't. It's exactly how you'd imagine a situation like this would go down. What starts as a fun night of dancing and flirting turns into a screaming, bloody horror as the entire dance troupe implodes in on themselves. The final 30 minutes play like a bad nightmare. The commitment to it was really impressive. I also didn't mind the set up characters early on as it ultimately ended up helping us understand their decisions, irrational as they may be, during their respective bad trips. One criticism I have were some of the visual decisions. Turning shots upside down can be effective, but not every time. Also, allegorical onscreen texts are really unnecessary, but telling that to Gaspar Noe is a fool's errand. I say, see it.",Climax

The dance moves of the actors were pretty awesome, very high energy dance moves.But wow, when the craziness begins, it just blew my mind. Gaspar Noé has an amazing talent for capturing the bizarre and psychedlic drug high on film like no other director I have seen. This film and his other, Enter The Void (2009) are just incredible films that will have you thinking ""WTF did I see?"" Both of those films had me thinking days after watching the film past.

Everyone is moving, and the scenes flow into each other as if it was one long continuous take. The photography is colorful and spellbinding. I was pleased that the cinematographer from Enter the Void (which is one of my favorite films) joined with Gaspar again. The dancers are remarkable for their talent, clothing (or lack thereof), fitness and freestyle movements.

If ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"" were choreographed, with a lot of hand jive - you might be on the trajectory to this. Meanwhile the horror here, well I think horror fans might have that as the champion....The film certainly is different, and I wondered if the director is also a Club DJ (perhaps so, looking at his directing history with musicians?). It's not a bad thing, in fact I think the strident in-your-face (or in-your-ears) is crucial to help with the disorienting feeling to help the audience feel the unreal reeling in the film.

42,garethcrook,When the party's over.,7,16 May 2021,"This starts with our cast, all dancers being interviewed. Their VHS recordings played back on an old CRT TV framed with DVDs and books. It's impossible not to pick out titles like Suspiria, Un Chien Andalou, Possession and books from Kafka, Fritz Lang and Nietzsche and not begin to expect a wild ride. Gaspar Noé is at the helm, so expect the unexpected. To be honest, it's hard to get a handle on to start. The group is large and have a habit of dancing everywhere so you have to keep up. Everyone's getting to know one another at a party after rehearsal. The music loud, the camera moving fluidly through long takes, sweeping around as they drink sangria and complement each other's dance moves. Before it morphs into a series of confessional vignettes, two characters at a time in corners of the room, amplifying the brewing tension, mostly sexual and setting the dynamic of the group. The setting is some abandon theatre space. It's not rundown, but it has character and along with the frenetic choreography and camera work, it's a heady mix. Something is going to go wrong. The first half is a swirling messy set up, punctuated at the half way point by the credits in the now typical Noé graphic style. It's a bit jarring, but works well for what's about to come. The room is reset. The party dwindling. Our dancers exhausted. The tone muted and menacing. The sangria is spiked with LSD, the messy narrative is about to be usurped by murderous nightmarish rampage that spirals far beyond any semblance of control. The one take long shot returns with a devastating sequence that runs unfathomably long, a magnificent piece of hellish choreography in itself, soundtracked by Aphex Twin, M/A/R/R/S, Daft Punk and screaming... a lot of screaming. There's a lot asked of these actors and they all deliver. Totally believable in their debauched craziness. The whole thing is magnificent though, from the obvious to the less so. The lighting crew for instance, bloody phenomenal. I have to be honest though, despite its successes. It's structural mess makes it hard to enjoy and for all the chaos, it's oddly linear. That said, it's certainly one to be seen by anyone who appreciates challenging cinema. It's not my favourite Noé, but it certainly is a wild ride.",Climax
43,ronakkotian,One word: INSANE!,8,11 July 2019,"I've been wanting to see Climax after hearing all the buzz surrounding it. After a few months, I finally got the chance to view it and it was the MOST INSANE EXPERIENCE EVER!By the end of it I was just in awe at what I just witnessed. This film was like no other. Climax was helmed by director Gaspar Noé who is known for the controversial films Irréversible and Enter the Void. He has a style for making very disturbing films that will be polarising between audiences. Climax goes through the same treatment. NOT EVERYONE WILL LIKE THIS MOVIE.First of all, I have to praise Gaspar Noé on his direction because it was shot masterfully. The camerawork on this film is one of the best I've ever seen. The way the camera moves in the small location it's set in, especially in the second half where it gets crazy, makes The movie feel more anxiety inducing than what it already is. The camera lingers on the scene for long periods of time, one lasting over 40 minutes. I find it a huge achievement for everyone involved to stay in character for that long.The music creates a fearful and disturbing atmosphere which suits the overall tone. The cinematography and choice of colours also intensifies what's going on.The acting is top-notch. Considering that this film is most of the dancers' first film is incredible. Everyone did an incredible job especially when they all get drugged. All of them had great chemistry with each other as shown when they have conversations with one another. Their reactions to the situation felt so real that it made the film so much more engrossing and hard to watch.The only problem I have was the story. At times, during the film, I wondered how will the story progress and by the end it didn't progress much. If the story was tighter then this film would have been perfect.Overall, Climax is an experience that's worth watching. It may be a film that will haunt and disturb you for days and make you feel extremely anxious by the end of it but you should watch it just to appreciate the amount of effort put into its craft as well the praising the outcome.",Climax

48,MovieCriticOnline,Bizarre mess,1,1 March 2019,"There are no spoilers to give because the trailer pretty much summed up the movie. Too bad because I like some of what A24 is putting out.Literally 10 minutes of interviews for the opening. Then a 5 min dance montage, followed by another 5 min music montage peppered with superfluous dialogue.
Only at 23 minutes do you see a break from music and dancing, to quickly get back to more music and gibberish.The music and dancing were okay, but does this make a film? I don't think so. Should films have rules? Maybe not, but guides. If you are going to make a movie why not do something that hasn't been done before? Paris is Burning comes to mind, but this is no Paris is Burning.This was total bizarro land... and not in any interesting, unique or groundbreaking way. Imagine the trailer, but then just 90 minutes of that trailer, ie. a 90-minute music video. Someone, please explain the point of this disaster?SKIP!",Climax
49,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,The ultimate conglomeration of all that is Noe,10,4 March 2019,"It is incredible that by taking all the boldest signature elements of his other films and ramming them all into one movie, while ceasing to do much experimentation and instead just delivering a no-holds-barred assault of everything that makes a Gaspar Noe movie what it is, he has crafted what I perceive to be his most accessible film and what many may see as his best (for me, it's my 2nd favorite right behind Enter The Void - but unlike the atmospheric spiritual journey that ETV brings a viewer on, Climax is ""all killer, no filler"").As far as I know, this is the world's first true TECHNO-HORROR film. Full-on techno culture crossed with full-on psychological horror. It's completely one-of-a-kind. I had a massive smile painted on my face through the majority of the film. This made me feel so much more than Luca Guadagnino's recent Suspiria remake, especially through it's incredible dance sequences - I couldn't help but groove in my seat during the majority of them. The soundtrack was fully up my alley, from Dopplereffekt to Legowelt to Aphex Twin to Giorgio Moroder - all the best in techno/electro. The diversity of the ensemble cast was impossible not to admire - so much personality to take in. The cinematography was absurdly impressive as always with Noe, functioning like you're watching through the eyes of a wandering ghost or almost another voiceless character in the room, effectively making you feel like the majority of the film is happening in ONE shot, without cutting.If you're a fan of film as an art form, or simply put, really INTENSE movies - you NEED to go see this ASAP, in the theater. This is a theater movie, not a watch-at-home movie! I will absolutely be seeing it a second time in the theater!Avoid this movie if you can't handle relentless psychological horror. Though it made me incredibly happy, this is the kind of movie that could trigger a certain claustrophobia for those who suffer from certain anxieties.It's MINDBLOWING! Noe has done it again. I can't say any more!",Climax
50,eagandersongil,ollective Hysteria,8,8 February 2019,"""Clímax"", new film by the illustrious, technical and accurate Gaspar Noé does not have the same impact and power of his previous works, but continues with a very clear technique and keeps his signature present, the objective of moving the viewer, what is displayed, and that goal is reaching to perfection.
The film tells the story of a dance group that goes to an abandoned room to do their last rehearsal, and they end up being drugged, and during that trip they find their inner self, their real beings come up without the re-usation of social reins, your inner monsters come along with your fears. Will I be a good mother? Will someone ever relate to me? Love me? Who I am? I feel forbidden desires. These are questions that arise in each character. Even so, this is a depth of script that exists but is not quite as deep, but works, it works to contextualize the real meaning of the long, cinematic immersion.
We have a camera that starts behaving, with wonderful sequences sequences aligned to good and uncomfortable choreographies, but that with the passing of the film, it gains a life of its own and goes into the habit of each character, and thus, if lost completely, The camera rotates 360 It gives jumps, closed planes, medium planes, aerial planes, we do not have a pattern. We have only one focus that is to cause the viewer to immerse, so we need more technical devices such as photography and games of lights, dark and reddish, that shine according to the state of the film's spirit, its strong and vibrant colors bother, such which is a kind of classical music, electronic and urban, is exquisite, it has a cool touch and at the same time is long and nauseating, it is uncomfortable and at the same time attractive, such a junction of technical aspects added to the delirious and ungovernable performances culminate in a film difficult to digest, but rewarding.
Because Gaspar Noe can again fulfill his goal as a director, we are sucked into another dimension during the film, a dark and dangerous dimension, it is tense. like every movie, it seems that life is always on the line and that we are going to die due to insanity and our inner monstrosity. ""Climax"" is far from perfect, with some gruesome performances and repetitions of the idea. Gaspar Noe's new film takes on and perfectly fulfills the promise (despite the exaggerated marketing).",Climax
51,fciocca,"A cinema experiment that has its moments, but ends up to be very confusing and inconclusive",5,4 November 2020,"I love when directors experiment and try to push boundaries. I often search for strange and different movies that separate from the most ""conventional"" and commercial cinema, but unfortunately not all experiment are good and ""Climax"" is the perfect example of a failed trial.First of all, it is too long and the buildup is too slow. I was almost giving up after 35 minutes of absolute nothing, just a bunch of people dancing and speaking about dirty and trivial stuff. This goes on for half of the movie. In the other half finally things start to move: we see characters tripping and while we go on, the situation gets worse and worse. There are a few scenes that are really uncomfortable, especially when drugs start to kick in, but then the movie becomes crazy. I understand that the director wanted to give a sense of confusion and he manages to do it at the beginning, by rotating the camera, or with unusual shootings, but then he decided to randomly panning and zooming, and I was completely lost. I don't even know what I watched in the last 20 minutes, because it was impossible to understand what was going on.Actors scream and panic for the whole time, and while this at first is effective because it creates a sense of discomfort, if does not evolve into something else, it is annoying. This is exactly what happened in ""Climax"". There is no evolution, there is no character development and this means that I don't really care about what is happening. Sure, we learn something at the beginning, but it is not enough to bound with them, because information given are vague as they speak only about superficial stuff, as already stated.Cinema is plenty of unconventional movies that are way much better such as ""Enter the Void"" or ""The Neon Demon"", just to make a couple of examples. ""Climax"" had potential, but it completely wasted it. This could have been a really nice short movie of about 1 hour. It would have been much better.",Climax

54,noahgibbobaker,Intoxicating and brilliant,9,7 June 2020,"Climax is a story about a group of dancers who have their drink spiked with LSD, the night only goes downhill from there. I loved watching these people change and begin behaving extremely irrationally. These people go from being mostly friendly with each other to very aggressive towards other becoming extremely violent and making people do completely insane things as the film gets more insane as well. Everything about Climax becomes crazy by the 40 minute mark, the camera does not stop moving at all from this point, it is upside-down for very long periods of time. Even when the camera is not filming upside-down every shot is still very interesting, whether it's showing impressive dancing for following someone around as the mingle with the crowd something interesting is always happening. Every performance is great, so good In fact I could not pick out a best or worst performance. Having so many long takes and pulling off some very difficult dance moves in pretty much all of them along with acting high on LSD would have been a nightmare but as I said the cast was great and pulled this off flawlessly. There are so many unique aspects shown in this film that just don't come up that often, like the Birdman esq long takes or the completely original dance choreography. All the technical aspects were also brilliant, I could not point out an obvious problem with these either. I should also mention there are some quite horrifying sequences in this film that personally tend to enjoy but these may put some viewers off. Despite all of this praise, there are a couple of things I did not enjoy . I first being some of the convocations felt a bit pointless. Second even though I loved the dancing in this film there was a lot of it at the start of the movie and it got a bit repetitive at a point, it became much more entertaining once the film picked up, but I feel a couple minutes of dancing could have been cut. Other than these two minor issues I loved the rest of this film and highly recommend you watch it.",Climax
55,amgee-89551,Very bizarre!!,2,25 January 2019,Climax is one of the most weirdest film I have ever seen. The plot was terrible. The acting was all over the place.

56,TheVictoriousV,Unequivocally the best film of 2019 (already),10,3 March 2019,"Gaspar Noé is one of the boldest, most unmistakable artists of all time. His films are so relentlessly horrifying, on visual, emotional, and even auditory levels, that they oft induce literal nausea (but still impress). Their colors are stark, their actors show authentic agony, and their camera work is ambitiously executed, including takes that last upwards of 30 minutes. His camera has its own life, even if we don't always feel as if we're on the mortal plane.Climax, his latest piece of French extremism, is not as hallucinatory as you may expect; it never lets us see that which is seen by its drugged protagonists, but simply observing their gradual descent into madness and anarchy in an isolated space via the hovering camera is still an outlandish experience. This is, of course, largely due to the acting. Even when the shots are seemingly endless and contain 20-ish actors doing things at once and several subplots intertwining, no-one in the cast or camera crew ever miss a beat. Or the special effects crew for that matter.It may qualify as one of the most flawlessly coordinated movies of the past 20 years, although I must note that many scenes (excluding the early, astonishing dance number) are improvised - so many, in fact, that in spite of its intricacies, Climax proved a relatively brisk production. The horrific intro in the snow was only added because, well, it had been snowing.The plot concerns a diverse class of dancers who, on a cold and dark night in the year 1996, gather in an abandoned school to celebrate a succesful rehearsal, only to find that the alcohol has been spiked with LSD and things go to Hell and beyond. There are some nods here to the works of Noe's old friend and fellow filmmaker Dario Argento, including a clearly visible Suspiria case during the prologue (I also spotted ""Labyrinth Man"", The Possession, and something by Fritz Lang).Most famous on the cast list is probably Sofia Boutella, known to overseas filmgoers for Star Trek Beyond (i.e. the one film from the new batch that actually feels like Star Trek) and the infinitely insipid Mummy reboot. I want this to be the film that truly opens the door for her and showcases her skill. But then, the acting all-around is unthinkably good.The setting, as I wrote above, is tight and isolated, and the music played in this place is perfectly selected. Trippy songs by the likes of Aphex Twin, Coh, and Wild Planet go well with the unnerving sounds of frequent Noe collaborator Thomas Bangalter.Noe has previously made Irreversible (which I found too disorienting on my first viewing and need to finish) and Enter the Void, which I've only seen a handful of times but confidently include amongst my favorite movies of all time. People weren't too hot on Love, but this is no doubt a return to form.I saw someone call Climax an anti-drug film, irately so. I believe it is only anti drugs in the same way that Requiem for a Dream is an ""anti-drug film"". If straightforwardly depicting the effects of acid makes a film ""anti drugs"", take it up with the drugs. Noe has first-hand experience with illegal substances; they inspired him to master the hallucinogenic imagery of Enter the Void and Irreversible. He seems the right man to portray their users.I don't care that we are only 3 months in. This is, unequivocally, my favorite movie of the entire year and may yet become even more than that. It is directed, shot, acted, and presented without fault, creating an experience that (despite, again, lacking outright surreal images) make nightmares seem escapist. I expected to utterly love it and it still went beyond. If it was mathematically possible for me to give it more than a 10/10 and place it higher on my list than number 1, I would. My God, Noe, you absolute madman!",Climax
57,Bertaut,"A disgusting, morally reprehensible piece of insane genius",9,8 October 2018,"Climax, the latest film from Argentinian-French provocateur Gaspar Noé, is a disturbing, depraved, disgusting, and debauched piece of absolute insane genius that I thoroughly adored from beginning to end, and which I never, ever, want to see again. Lord of the Flies by way of Heronimus Bosch or Zdzislaw Beksinski, Climax is what you might get if you mashed-up Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma (1975), Mother! (2017), and Step Up (2006); a dance movie that morphs into a horror film, which then attempts to show the audience a literal hell on Earth. With Climax, Noe takes the audience and characters further than ever before. Granted, there's nothing here to rival The Butcher's sickening attack on his pregnant wife from Seul contre tous (1998), or the near-unwatchable rape and fire extinguisher scenes from Irréversible (2002). However, whereas those films feature sudden moments of barbaric violence punctuating (relatively) quotidian narratives, in Climax, the oppressive feeling of dread is unrelenting. So even though the acts of violence are not, in themselves, as extreme as some of those in Noé's back-catalogue, the cumulative effect is far worse. Obviously, this makes the film something of an endurance test, even at only 96 minutes, but this is precisely the point - Noé wants the audience to be utterly exhausted by the end, and he employs numerous confrontational and disorientating techniques to achieve such.Set in the winter of 1996, and allegedly based on a real incident in France that year, the film focuses on a dance troupe putting the finishing touches to a performance before embarking on a national tour, to be followed by a series of dates in the US. Apart from the opening shot, and a couple of quick shots towards the end, the entire film is set in the rehearsal space; an isolated and unoccupied hall. Upon finishing rehearsals, the troupe starts to party, as we primarily follow Selva (Sofia Boutella), the group's choreographer. As the night wears on, it becomes apparent that one of their members has spiked the sangria with powerful LSD, with each of the troupe descending into their own personal Hades of paranoia, aggression, and/or uninhibited sexuality.In lieu of any kind of title card or opening credits, Climax begins with an abstract and non-descript shot of pure white. So visually indeterminate is the image (it could literally be anything) that at the screening I attended, most people (myself included) didn't even realise the film had begun. It is only as a girl staggers into shot from the top of the frame that it becomes apparent we are looking directly downwards onto a snowfield. The girl is in great distress, leaving a trail of blood in her wake. After a moment, she collapses onto the snow, her body convulsing, unable to go any further. The camera then revolves upwards along the vertical-axis through 360 degrees, a shot anyone familiar with Noé's work will immediately recognise. Revealing the bare branches of a few nearby threadbare trees, the movement immediately establishes that we are in an isolated location in the dead of winter. By the time the frame returns to its starting position, the girl's struggles have fashioned a hideously disproportioned and asymmetrical red-tinted snow angel. Theoretically, this could be the cliched opening scene to any generic slasher movie. However, the striking composition and the economy with which the shot conveys so much information serve to betray the fact that this is not the work of an anonymous journeyman for hire, but is instead the meticulously composed opening salvo of an auteur who knows precisely what he's doing.A moment later, the entire closing credits roll (upwards, obviously), right to the copyright information. With no closing credits at the end, the audience is allowed no transition from the film to reality. As the film ended, the lights immediately popped on, with no music to play us out, no darkened theatre to recompose ourselves. Indeed, to enhance the sense of discombobulation for which Noé is obviously striving, the last 15 minutes or so of the film are literally upside-down. The audience is thus placed in the same position as the characters - the absence of closing credits and the inverted image create a sense of confusion and discomfort, just as the film is depicting the surviving dancers coming out of their drug-induced mania and back to the real world. As he attempts to do throughout the film, Noé places the audience directly into the psychological reality of the characters.After the opening scene, the film then cuts to a TV screen showing the dancers' audition interviews, which do a terrific job of establishing the differing characters, as do the dialogue scenes after the rehearsal but before the LSD has kicked in. The third scene is the dance number, which is easily the best dance sequence I've ever seen on film. Shot in a continuous 20 minute take, this grants the scene a sense of real-time immediacy and in-camera verisimilitude which one can usually only acquire from a live performance - this isn't something constructed by an editor from a series of individual set-ups, this is something literally happening before our eyes.Thus ends the first section of the film. The second, and much shorter, section is the dancers engaged in conversation with one another (and, in contrast to the first section, is made up of a multitude of edits eschewing any sense of match-cutting). The third, and longest, section sees them realise the sangria is spiked, attempt to find out who did it, and the chaos that ensues when the drugs take hold. These three sections (dance, conversations, and drugs) roughly correspond to the three books of the Divina Commedia - Paradiso, Purgatorio, and Inferno. However, in the poem, the order is Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso, charting the ascension of the soul from the Inferno of Hades to the Paradiso of heaven. In the film, the movement is in the opposite direction, as the Paradiso of the harmonious and unified perfection in the dance sequence gives way to the calm Purgatorio after the consumption of the LSD, but before it has taken over their reason. Finally, they descend to the Inferno. In charting this allegorical journey, one of the most immediately interesting things is the obvious visual contrast to the dance sequence. Whilst the dance sees the group acting in unison, all of a single mind, the third section of the film shows them fragmented and in disarray, each individual driving towards their own purpose, whether it be paranoia, hedonism, or what they believe they need to do to survive. The harmony of the troupe has given way to the horror of individualised disintegration and psychological collapse.We then witness a girl's head being set on fire, a pregnant girl being kicked repeatedly in the stomach, a girl slashing her own arm and face, a contortionist contorting to the point where he literally splinters his own bones, a child locked in a room full of cockroaches, a man scratching his chest to the point that it turns into four red bloody streaks, public urination, lesbian rape, incest, and suicide. As the veneer of civilisation is stripped away, the characters devolve before our eyes; some become concerned only with sex, others with violence.It would certainly be easy to dismiss Climax as thematically empty, arguing that the brilliant camerawork and pumping soundtrack serve only to cover up the vapidity at its core, to argue that the depravity and excess is not in the service of any grand universal point, but simply to show attractive young people tearing one another apart. However, there is some kind of political point buried beneath the carnage; the dance sequence takes place in front of a massive French flag, whilst the credits declare, ""A French Film. And proud of it."" Perhaps related to this, the troupe is made up of a cross-section of Europeans, and in the explosion of excess hedonism and hysterical mayhem, does this cross-section of ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations come to represent European multiculturalism tearing itself apart? Is Noé saying that if France continues to accommodate such a diversity of disparate cultures, chaos will ensue?In relation to this, perhaps tellingly, Omar (Adrien Sissoko), the person who is initially blamed for spiking the sangria, is Muslim. So, is Noé saying that in such a multicultural milieu, with fear of Islam at a high, it's very easy to blame everything on the Islamic ""Other"". Additionally, Noé depicts the dance scene with such reverence and awe that this kind of social critique, barely straddling the line between patriotism and xenophobia, doesn't seem to sit especially comfortably. Not to mention that Noé himself is an immigrant - he was born in Argentina, moving to France when he was 13.The fact is, I don't have a clue what Climax is about. Nor do I care. Nor is it important. I take it for what it appears on the surface; an incredibly technically proficient depiction of a contemporary Inferno, as aesthetically impressive as it is morally questionable, as enthralling as it is disturbing, a film of unparalleled barbarism, that also stands as one of the most extraordinary cinematic achievements in recent years. It's a work of genius. Twisted, sick, depraved genius, but genius nonetheless. It disturbed me like no film in at least a decade, and I couldn't get it out of my head for days afterwards. I absolutely loved every single crazy minute of it. And I don't ever wish to see it again.",Climax
58,scb_coldsteel,One of the most immersive experiences I've had from a film.,6,17 March 2019,"So I saw Climax a few days ago at the theater. I literally have not stopped thinking about the movie and the overall experience the film provided. Casper Noe is a master provocateur and he certainly made a film that will stay with you for days. I can't say it was an enjoyable experience, but I don't think it was supposed to be. It was an incredibly unique and jarring film that should be experienced though.The plot of the movie can be summed up easy enough without spoiling anything. ""Drugs are bad M'Kay"". The film follows a diverse group of dancers as they finish up an intricate and well choreographed dance routine. After a long and tedious introduction the film descends into a nightmare fever dream that is designed to provoke emotions and make you as uncomfortable as possible. The film certainly was a success in that regard.The movie was populated with acts of violence and depravity that will leave many in shock. One of the most terrifying aspects of the film being it was grounded in reality. All these depraved and shocking moments on screen were not exaggerated, but gritty and raw. This only further added to the experience the film provided.I'm having a hard time really classifying this film under any given genre. It certainly had elements of psychological terror and put forward a number of disturbing scenes, but it's not quite horror. Hell it's almost hard to classify this as a film in the first place in the traditional sense. This feels more like an interactive art project than a coherent story.Like the best abstract art this movie acts as a Rorschach test designed to push viewers experiences. I normally don't read other reviews before writing my own, but I had to see how other people interpreted the film. Is it a philosophical meditation on human nature? An allegorical masterpiece? A product of insanity or genius? Is it pretentious nonsense? Or is it simply exploitive trash? It can be all those things and much more. It was an experience that demands to be felt. I can't say I enjoyed the film, but it was one of the most immersive experiences I've had from a film.Climax asks the audience a complex question. Is art designed to be enjoyed or experienced? In the case of Climax the movie is designed specifically to provoke an emotion. Climax wants you to feel something as a viewer. Something primal, uncomfortable, and anxiety inducing. It's the kind of jarring experience that will leave you in shock for day. It was the kind of experience that will really make you think about the movie. Climax demands that you are an active viewer. It really pushes the boundaries of what it means to be a film.From a purely technical point this movie should be seen anyway. The cinematography and choreography were outstanding. Of course all of the dance numbers were intricate and well done, but the most impressive aspect being how they were shot. The film utilizes single takes for long stretches of time all the while the camera seamlessly floats around capturing some truly wonderful scenes. There's almost a 20 minute stretch without a single cut all the while the camera acts as an omnipresent viewer following different characters and their drug-induced stupor. Plus the color and lighting of the film were perfect to push the changes that occurred in the narrative of the film. It's not my genre of music, but the techno dance soundtrack was also perfectly incorporated. The technical aspects were the best part of the film and really stand out.That all being said Climax was not what I would call a good movie in any traditional way. While the film is relatively short, around 40 minutes of the movie was literally nothing but mindless dialogue and dancing. This wasn't a case of a slow burn start to build suspense. It was a tedious and mind-numbing experience just to make you feel uncomfortable. There simply was no driving plot for the bulk of the film. All of your expectations as a viewer ultimately fall flat as the movie never really delivers on its promise providing terror. I will also add that while yes, the scenes were designed to be provocative, I have certainly seen worse in film. The content didn't make me feel uncomfortable as much as the movie itself did.I also have to mention how utterly terrible the acting and dialogue was. All of the dialogue felt utterly pointless and added nothing to the film. It would be one thing if the actors delivered their lines in a believable manner, but they all failed to do so. The whole thing felt far more like a College term project instead of a major film. I will also mention that the abstract and allegorical aspects of the film were purely unintentional on the directors behalf. He has gone on record saying the film is not a allegory and ultimately he wasn't making a social or political statement. Sometimes viewers read into things that simply aren't there.So Climax was one of the most disturbing experiences I've had since Salo. In both cases the films weren't truly scary, but they were uncomfortable and anxiety inducing. Climax is less of a coherent film and more of an art project. It is the kind of ultimately pretentious content that will have critics raving. I did not enjoy Climax as a movie. I enjoyed the technical aspects of the film and I liked that they tried to make an immersive and powerful experience. The film was very successful in that regard. As far as crafting an intricate psychological thriller this movie falls flat and will leave many bored and scratching their head wondering what the hype was about.This is an incredibly difficult film to try and rank numerically. It succeeded in everything it was trying to accomplish, still it had too many glaring issues for me to call it a good movie. I would still highly recommend everyone watch it though for a unique and powerful experience. Climax will certainly make you feel something as a viewer and if that is enough for you the film is sure to wow. For me it was just a muddled nightmare that tried way too hard to be cool. 6 out of 10.",Climax

There are 3 types of amazing films, Those that keep you highly entertained, Those that expand your mind on what's possible and Those that shake you to the core and invoke disturbing emotions carving out a little piece in your mind that will never allow you to forget what you're eyes reluctantly seen. ""CLIMAX"" By all accounts doesn't just embody all of those traits it pushes the limits of those attributes and dares to raise the bar. When you first begin the film it kind of whispers as you watch slowly creeping along as the characters ramble and speak giving you a glimpse of what they're mind may percieve. But all bets are off once the stage is set and after 5 mins. Of revving the engines the gas peddle is smashed and like a rocket the film blasts off. The dialogue of this film is so jaded and amazingly fresh. As you watch a lifestyle to most that's absolutely foreign and yet each scene reveals elements you can relate. The beauty of the characters dancing and the videography form such an amazing connection you never lose step of what is seen. And as the movie unfolds so does the camera angles bringing you the viewer and the characters to a climactic embrace you literally feel the effects that they are portraying on screen. The realism of this film is terrifyingly unmatched and it doesn't take the peasant road of filming it through found footage to try and fake feeling real.. No it's authenticity is the dance group who some are admittedly just meeting each other so as there relationship grows the viewers grow along with it amplifying a feel that's genuinely real and not rehearsed. There are so many characters to meet at once it may seem hard to distinguish on first glance but every character is tied to a specific style of dance and you get acquainted by watching them move. With amazing talent that everyone of them possess you feel an admiration and respect regardless of how much your really into dancing yourself. To say Gaspar Noe is a great director and writer would be a pitiful label to thrust upon his film that ignites a magnificence rarely achieved by the best filmmakers of all time. It may be compared to other films I really loved like ""SUSPIRIA"" to name one and I'm ok with that, It's fair game to compare but the feeling I got when the final shot turned white is way past and above any of those compared films whether it's the remake or original... 10 stars means one thing..

65,pere-25366,Absolute mayhem and destined to be misunderstood - 8/10 ⭐,8,24 December 2019,"Holy cow! This was the first film by Gaspar Noé I had seen and I'm currently struggling to put into words exactly what I experienced. What starts as a fun, underground dance party quickly spirals into a nightmarish descent that is better left seen than explained. For people who don't vibe with this, all I can say is that cinema was initially created to provoke the senses and elicit our deepest primal emotions. Think the cinema of Luis Buñuel and Salvador Dali. This is what cinema can feel like. I'm speechless. Say Yes to Noe!",Climax

67,torrascotia,More French Arty Garbage.,1,7 March 2019,"This is an extraordinarily bad movie experience.
This is from same director who made Irreversible, the movie which prompted mass walk outs and for good reason. He seems to enjoy disgusting people with violence most would not class as entertainment. We yet again are subjected to extended discussions about anal sex which seems to be a theme in this directors work, to what purpose? It seems its all about intentionally trying to provoke disgust ""in the name of art"". In Climax we see pregnant women being kicked in the stomach, small children drugged and electrocuted and incest between siblings.
That is the tone of the movie and it beggars belief that this has any high ratings on here at all, or it says alot about the moral compass of those who enjoyed this trash. Its basically aimed at a pretentious audience who believe they have superior taste to others because they think ""enjoy"" things the majority rightly ignore or that because the movie is in French its somehow above critique. If this had come from Hollywood or if more people knew about its content it would have been slated.
The film itself doesn't amount to much. Its based around a group of dancers, we initially see them being interviewed then it moves to the dancefloor. An extended stylised dance sequence takes place before a party where most the dancers drink a sangria spiked with LSD. The remainder of the film is basically each dancer having a bad LSD trip and the final act is just plain nonsense with everyone writhing around on the floor while a red strobe flashes and camera is shot upside down. Oooh arty.
The odd thing is that none of the dancers seem to have any clue as to how LSD affects individuals, they all have the same reaction which is negative. This rings hollow. Anyone who has attended a rave or music festival where hundreds if not thousands of people may be on drugs do not all decide to try and kill each other. Its not a realistic premise. Nor is the premise that despite bad things happening they would all decide to hang around in the same room. Its difficult to make a movie about being trapped with others when the doors are all unlocked. Fail.
There really isn't anything about this which is positive, its odd that quite a few well know electronic musicians agreed to have their music attached to such a bad movie. That being said the musical choices of each artists don't exactly fit well with the scenes they are used in. Although the soundtrack is probably what attracts some of the audience.
Oh yeah the closing credits of the movie are at the start and some of them are written upside down or backwards. If you think thats ""edgy"" then you may like but if you just find it tedious trying to read upside down or backwards then head for the exit because it just gets worse,way worse after the credits roll.",Climax
68,babyjaguar,"CLIMAX OR DANSE MACABRE: ""RAVING"" UP THE VIOLENCE!",5,20 March 2019,"This Gaspar Noe film is purely an artistic attempt, nonetheless not original, maybe completely unintentional its reminiscence of an old story from the classic 70s exploitative film, ""I Drink Your Blood"". Another film that explores a group of free-spirited (and drug-induced) people but are fed rabid-infested food. They end up going mad and doing violent acts toward each other.The film is supposed to be set in the mid 90s but the French slang, dance moves and DJ music tracks is completely off. Maybe it was a 90s ""Rave"" party in a multiverse location? Its definitely the ""Party Monster"" film reinvented but if you love dancing, this film delivers.It rivals the recent ""Suspiria"" remake's attempt to re-imagined its original filmmaker Dario Argento's planned 1978 dance scene that was never filmed. That being said it borrows Argento's upside-down camera shots from his 1996 film, ""Stendahl Syndrome"". Another Argento reference is that the one of the DJ tracks sounded like a song from Argento's 80s ""Phenomena"" film.It takes awhile for the ""climax"" to fully happen as a notable attempt to deconstruct ""dancing"" and experimental drug culture (acid, bathsalts, LSD, etc.) but falls weak.

72,cappiethadog,Rock on,9,26 March 2019,"The woman will die from hypothermia if no one on a snowmobile passes by soon. She needs a St. Bernard, stat; and make sure that dog has a barrel filled with a good stiff brandy. Is she a dancer who got left behind at some bus pit stop? No. At the derelict old building that houses the dance repertoire, every performer is accounted for. The contemporary dance routine, fully staffed, goes off without a hitch. The choreographer seems pleased. So who is she then, this dislocated female in distress, screaming for help? The woman sees imported from another genre, a survival film; a plan crash survivor who went rogue from ""Alive"" in search of another diegesis, a parallel oasis with food and water. ""Climax"" isn't a survival film, is it? She's not the dancer who came in from the cold; she has no affiliation with this makeshift school for the performing arts. Right? ""Climax"" is not your father's ""Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo"". Form-wise, because of the disparateness between the opening scene and the first interior shot, the film could be construed as having the potentiality of being ""Blazing Saddles"" in slow-motion, but instead of a western, it's an adventure film that finds itself on a collision course with the musical. The woman's survival is of no consequence. The filmmaker forgets about her. If you forget about her, too, filmmaker Gaspar Noe will be pleased. ""Climax"" is a meta-commentary on American film. Noe's latest provocation, with its long uninterrupted takes is the antithesis of ""Flashdance"", whose editing style, informed and inspired by MTV, gave audiences short memories and made it harder for people to follow multiple narratives. The woman outside is an inconvenience. The woman's storyline; her progress towards the sanctuary of that derelict old building, gets discarded. She's a red herring. ""To dance right through your life,"" to pursue your dreams of dancing on Broadway, ""what a feeling"" that must be when you're young and your whole life is ahead of you. ""Climax"" never leaves the warehouse. No cutaways to feet in decline, dragging across the snow; feet do what do best, keep the dancer, vertical. It's the final rehearsal, a graduation day without the pomp and ceremony of a gown and cap. The French dance company is taking their show overseas where the lights are brighter and the stakes are higher. Clapping Americans are the most important clappers. The dancers know this. A little fame may be in store for them. But ""Climax"" gets off on the wrong foot, so to speak. Get rescued or die. That is not a pertinent question. Peel away the same old rags to riches storyline that's been told since a young hayseed with stars in his eyes said: ""Hey, my uncle has a barn. Let's put on a show."" More or less, ""Climax"" is Busby Berkeley's ""Babes in Arms"", set to Daft Punk and Aphex Twin.Dance or die? It's not the question the choreographer asks, but it might as well be. ""What would you do without dance in your life,"" is the actual question posed to a candidate. ""Suicide,"" the female dancer answers to the off-camera voice, Lou(Soufelia Yahoub), the aforementioned choreographer, captured for posterity on VHS tape, during the sit-down part of the audition. Hyperbolic, a little, this patented response, meant to impress the interviewer, but not by much. When the talking head is finally attached the body in perpetual motion, Selva(Sofia Boutella) dances as if her life depended on it. It's the same psychical surgery for the others, as well. Do these young people have a contingency plan should their dreams not go according to their liking? Probably not. They are living in the moment, sweaty day to sweaty day, and party all night, every night. The goal is to be seen by the right people who can propel them from obscurity to stardom. The lights in their rehearsal space doesn't have a lot of wattage. Only the lights in their eyes are bright. The people who populate ""Climax"" are living in an Irene Cara fever dream. So which one is Cara's alter-ego Coco? They're all Coco; both the girls and the boys want to be the confident young woman with talent to burn, who sang, ""I'm going to live forever,"" in the 1980 Alan Parker film. ""Fame"" is fleeting, however, and so is life itself. What will Coco do if her embryonic career as a popular singer doesn't pan out? Alex(Jennifer Beals), the flash dancer, has a trade to fall back on. ""What a feeling,"" it must be to know that you can weld. Soldering copper pipes can wait. Hard hat, blow torch, lunch pail, thermos; the accoutrements of a blue-collar worker can stay where it is, untouched, posing for a still life. It's New York or bust; it's time to get out of Pittsburgh. But in Coco's case, Parker suggests, fame may potentially be of the infamous kind. People won't remember her name; they'll remember her alias' name, if even that. At the performance arts high school, Coco has friends and associates. Doris, Ralph and Leroy are her friends, but her collaborator, Bruno Martelli(Lee Curreri) is her associate. Bruno, the portrait of an iconoclast as a young man, arrives at the performing arts school with his synthesizers; his futurist mindset, an affront to establishment types such as Professor Shorofsky(Albert Hague), a proponent of baroque instruments. The proto-EDM artist, in some respects, can be characterized as a forerunner to Daddy(Kiddy Smile), the commonwealth dancers' deejay. Both are part of the vanguard, revolutionaries who make traditional musical outfits ranging from orchestras to four-piece bands obsolete. But whereas Daddy can be a band, who not only spins and manipulates vinyl records, and most importantly, ingratiates himself within the collective whole, as when he leaves his exalted perch behind the turntable to bust a few moves of his own, crossing the boundary between master and servant; Bruno, conversely, likes the concentrated ascendancy that comes with rewriting the rules in his own image, telling Shorofsky: ""Who needs an orchestrar? You can do it all with a keyboard, an amp, and enough power,"" as a member of the new order. He doesn't need sheet music of the old masters. He doesn't need a conductor. He broke the baton in two. The sheet music is in tatters; the old masters are granules of putrescent dust in a coffin. He writes the songs, alone. Fast-forward to 1996. Oh, no, the DJ is on acid. Somebody spiked the sangria. Daddy lost control. The techno music playing over the PA system has no oversight. The Prodigy has unchecked power.No one from this group would be caught dead with a Rolling Stones album. The woman in the snow; the woman who is ""Out Here On My Own"" crashes the mis-en-scene with her survival narrative in tow, turning ""Climax"" into a survival film, after all, a tragi-comic Mel Brooks mash-up. Instead of two soundstages, it's the settings of the single interior and single exterior that converge. The woman who came in from the cold transfixed the cocktails with acid. Unbeknownst to Psyche(Thea Carla Schott), she tracked down her Berlin roommate. The woman in the snow is named, we surmise, is ""Angie"", like the song, a rock song, an outlier on the EDM-heavy soundtrack. In Pablo Pier Passolini's ""Salo"", the Ennio Morricone score competes with the Frederick Chopin piano pieces that the fascists use as an anesthetizing backdrop for the base and amoral tales they unspool to their young prisoners. Bruno, in a sense, avenges these fascists, theoretically, when he enacts a hegemonic shift from classical to popular. The idealism of a new music language, however, over time, can curdle into demagoguery. Bruno won the fight, the usurpation is complete, the old masters has lost its relevancy, but EDM, the end-result of the young American's pioneering work, turns into music of the ruling class. Angie, in a fight for rock's proletarian soul, co-opts electronica, the music of debauchery; the music of the people that Passolini condemned. She's no fascist; she's an Englishman in drag. Mick Jagger fighting Keith Flynt, or rather, an imitation of Flynt, alive in the grooves of a record that the deejay spins on his turntable.Angie goes through Cara's inferno and comes out the other side, and lives to fight another day, undoing the damage that new traditionalists like Bruno had unleased on the world. Rock music is no longer at the center of youth culture.To rock, is to be a revolutionary.",Climax

It generates interest and then surprises with the increase in horror it projects.As a dancer I say that this work has the best choreography and opening of all time. As the dance is accompanied by the play of lights, the camera approaches, the theatricality, the presence of the voice and reaching the maximum physical states makes it transcend as a creepy contemporary piece.I could say many thousand things but the idea is not to go around the bush, it is undoubtedly one of my favorites of all time and I consider this tape of those that I can see a thousand times and it will always generate the same thing from the same desire to be in that grand opening dancing to that despair and claustrophobia at the end.Gaspar Noe is a damn genius.",Climax
75,ccamp89,Weak 3.5 // Mostly succeeds as viscera,7,6 April 2019,"As an exercise in pure viscera, Argentine provocateur Gaspar Noé mostly pleases with Climax. A group of dancers unknowingly drink spiked sangria which slowly warps their afterparty into an LSD-soaked nightmare. With a premise like that, it may be evident that this is a film meant to be experienced rather than thought about. The pleasures of Climax come nearly entirely from its sheer audiovisual power: the ceaselessly pulsating score, the fluid one-shot takes, the lurid colors. It's closer to performance art than what most people would characterize as a ""movie"" and should be approached with that mindset if you're to enjoy it. However, as enjoyable as its best sequences are, the lack of nearly any thematic depth imbues much of the film with a subtly nagging tediousness. And even when viewed purely from an experiential perspective, it is far from watertight in its pacing and flow. Still, there is a cumulative power in its sound, visuals, and theatrics that's hard to deny.Weak 3.5/5",Climax

80,ianwagnerwatches,A Great Experiment,6,13 August 2020,"This film is a lot. The film is composed of very long takes with fun, disorienting camerawork; the dialogue and many of the events themselves were entirely improvised; there are a lot of fascinating things going on here. The first half of the film is magnetic: there's some great improvised dialogue, a really well shot dancing segment that felt totally natural, a great title sequence that was clearly a labor of love, and a lot of intriguing and shockingly good performances, considering there's only one professional actor in this film. Very good beginnings.However, as the film progressed, the long takes start to feel longer and the characters, as they descend into madness, somehow become terribly boring to watch. The story flatlines partway through the second act, and it becomes more of a show than a story. TLDR, the latter half of the film is mostly just people screaming, and it's a bit tiresome.I admire this film, and I admire its director and his vision, but it lost me in the 3rd act. I recommend this film to anyone that wants to see something strange, or if you're high and want to go for a ride.

(tomato thrown at screen),2,26 May 2019,"Ok, if you were expecting something like Irreversible or Enter the Void then you will be very very disappointed.I don't think Noe is trying hard enough here. This feels like a student film made in a weekend. It may well have been made in only a few hours. It's quick and crude.It appears that an actual dance troupe was hired and encouraged to ""act"". There appears to have been no script whatsoever.The best parts of the movie are some very long dance routines. They take up almost half the movie, it's quite impressive but during the second one I found myself reaching for the fast forward button.The second half of the film is incredibly boring. The contrast with the beginning is clunky. It's an entire group of twenty people acting randomly and violently, without any story. It goes on and on... there's a rough concept about a sangria spiked with LSD but that's about as much story as we get. Why did the dancers become so violent and horrible? Not explained. There's some cheap camera stunts and then the film ends.It's super embarrassing that Noe turned this out.Also note, I am a huge fan of electronic music, and the soundtrack really wasn't all that hot in my opinion. The long tracks played in the dance scenes are super repetitive and become tedious. The film seems to be attempting to be set in the 1990s but the music is evidently not from that time period, which contributes to the cheap quick and nasty vibe of this production.",Climax

83,jmerlino,Maybe it's better if you're French,6,18 August 2020,"There's no denying that Gaspar Noe has developed a unique and arresting visual language. The camera is as much a character in his movies as any of the people. In the service of a great idea, this can make for a stunning film, and Noe did that very adroitly in Enter the Void.In this film, however, his visual innovations are largely wasted, as they contribute mostly disorientation without any seeming reason for it.So, the plot in a nutshell: A bunch of French dancers get together for a rehearsal. Someone spikes the sangria with LSD. They all go nuts in an orgy of sex, violence, and general screaming and confusion.There are certainly references to Dante's inferno, and I would imagine that there's a good bit of commentary on French politics, in as much as there's a big red white and blue curtain that forms a giant French flag. One of the characters even remarks on it, in case you don't catch it.I will say that I did not find this movie nearly as disturbing as some of the other reviewers here. Yes, some of the violence was pretty nasty, but I was expecting something much much worse.The camera goes a little nutty during the acid sequence, and while I suppose the effect is meant to be hallucinatory, it really just makes the scene confusing.This is clearly meant to be an allegorical movie that's not meant to be taken literally, but even taking that into account, I can't get over my main beef with this film: To the best of my knowledge, LSD has NEVER made a group of people act like that. One might thing that Gaspar has no knowledge of LSD whatsoever, apart from war-on-drugs propaganda, but having seen Enter the Void, that doesn't seem possible.I'm giving this movie six stars mostly for technical excellence. There are some arresting images, and some of the camera effects couldn't have been easy to pull off.

84,xmdbx,It's Not That Deep,5,26 August 2019,"The idea of Climax is an interesting one. It follows the same structure as a found-footage film if the found footage was shot professionally with a full crew. The events in the film follow a narrative but they are not leading towards anything. It's simply a progression of what might happen next in relation to preceding events. The film's problems come not from this unconventional style of storytelling but from the ""story"" itself. Nothing in the film matters any more than anything else. The film keeps the viewers interested through shock-value more than anything else which, to me, comes off as cheap. There's not much to enjoy during the movie since it's mostly unpleasant. I think I understand that it's trying to forego the need for anything other than a climax but other than the atypical structure and some of the displeasing scenes, this film isn't memorable for much.",Climax

 Gaspar Noe plays with your mind and your emotions in every way possible. The nightmarish cineatography, the unsetting colours apperaing in the screen, the horryfiyng soundtrack ( Supernature is spectacular!), the the non-stop movement of the camera and the incredible work by the cast- which mainly consists of kids between 18 to 23 years old who only do sorts of krump dance-offs or voguing balls mash up in a 1 and a half hour film which is as electrifiyng as hell. 
I really admire such films, that are able to make you part of their universe, even if it is totally odd and ablnormal, and force you to feel one of with the situation, thus creating a completely genuine cinematic expericence.
 I also love the filrst dance scene, which is actually a single shot and you can actually see the amount of effort that the actors put to take you by the hand and pull you in their own world filled with fleeting plesures. And this is what CLIMAX really is.

92,RaulFerreiraZem,Climax,5,21 October 2019,"Climax, to me can be defined by 30 or so minutes of ostentatious film making, with its long takes and its gogard-ian stylized texts,etc. Plus about 60 or so minutes of empty sensationalism.One must wonder, how can Noe at the same time romanticize and aestheticize this semi bohemian, recreational drug taking lifestyle while being such a moralistic tool? ( all the adulterous people in his films end up being punished in one way or another, in his films drugs lead to alienation and death.) The only answer i can think of is this; Aestheticizing and problematizing and most importantly, making it seem counter cultural and dangerous to live such a lifestyle he essentially is making himself a martyr and a hero for despite of such dangers indulging himself in drugs and sex.Despite all of that, the film is not a failure since all of its artifices work quite well.
The long introduction works as a premonitory character investigation and can give you early hints on where the movie is going. One weird thing worth pointing out however is the way the movie depicts black people. So early on we have a really long and uncomfortable scene where two black men discuss raping one of their colleagues. Not only that but later in the film in the lynching scene we see a white woman as innocent and fragile while black men and women ignorantly accuse her and literally ask her to kill herself. Not only that but the only one person who stands up for her is a white woman.Quite alike to the first minutes of Irreversible, the last 20 or so minutes of Climax use some of the same camera effects to disorient to build suspense. All of that works really well, but like the rest of the film seem gratuitous. In love with nihilist catchphrases Noe almost at the end of the film says to us that Living is a collective impossibility. It might be so, but it seems like a bit of a exaggeration coming from a film that depicts a tragedy that could be so easily avoided. The sole fact that he had to go as far as digging some urban legend from 20 years ago just to make his audience feel like people are awful and untrustworthy makes me realize how much people are great and trustworthy. I don't think that living is a collective impossibility, i think that Noe's films try really hard to depict collective cases of bad faith.",Climax

All that aside though you're having fun. Sure it's not perfect but maybe you've been too negative about the whole thing. There's something oddly mesmerizing about it and you feel like your in some euphoric trance. Then sometimes there's that clutch moment where everything goes 180.

He is clearly trying so hard to shock the audience and make everyone hate the movie to such a degree that I don't see a point in indulging in his twisted fantasies that have no ultimate payoff. The film is just mindless violence and stupid shock value with terrible characters,plot and sub-par acting.Noe might say he draws inspiration from Kubrick but he's just an art-house version of Eli Roth.

99,lumieretrain,Climax by Gaspar Noé,8,25 December 2019,"The stories about a group of people who are having fun in any kind of places, to celebrate a party or even to prepare for the next days rehearsal, are one of the most unexpected stories to tell. As these parties are surrounded by loud rhythmic songs, with more or less choreographed dancers, who express all of their emotions through the dance as body language. Until something unexpected would happen to the main characters, who would live in a nightmare which they cannot escape. Some of these stories would end with the main characters who survive from the nightmare, while other stories would end with the main characters who die from the nightmare. The auteur filmmaker Gaspar Noé seems intrigued to explore this theme, in the most unexpected way and unforgettable way. As the shooting of the movie took only 15 days, which is unusual to shoot a film with that brief time, in 2018 came out Climax by Gaspar Noé with Sofia Boutella, Kiddy Smile, Romain Guillermic, Souheila Yacoub, Claude Gajan Maull, Giselle Palmer, Taylor Kastle and Thea Carla Schott. The movie's plot: In the mid 1990s, a group of dancers join in a boarding school, for three day rehearsal with a DJ, their choreographer and her little son. All of them are having fun, until they would realize in the drink sangria is filled with LSD, which everyone is going to live in an irreversible nightmare. The movie would capture the audience attention from the beginning to the end, without letting them be distracted by anything. The camera and the lightings work to be compatible, in every single angle shots and in every camera movements, especially to see what would happen to the main characters. As most of the long takes help to capture the audience attention, to see how much the nightmare would go far. The editing was specifically elaborated to create scary atmospheres filled with suspense, without ruining the narration's rhythm, needed to see what the main characters would go through. Each of the actors, especially the ones who play the dancers, did an excellent performance as some of them have initially a bond with each other. Until the nightmare would cause them to not have anymore trust with anybody, as they would be unprepared with what is going to happen with all of them. Each of the actors who play the dancers have done an extraordinary choreography, as the main characters would communicate their feelings only through dancing. Especially in the dance sequences surrounded by the rhythmic songs, which can be felt their rhythm in their movements. Climax is one of the most thrilling and unexpected movies of all time, as well as one of the best Gaspar Noé's movies.",Climax

101,achmoye,"Drugs, again ?",3,7 February 2019,"I really hated this movie. I don't care about drugs, and this movie made me care even less.
This movie tries so hard to be politically incorrect, it's beyond depicable.I love the IMDB game that occurs with these controversial movies :
People who appreciate will be like ""don't listen to bad reviews"" and vice-versa. Lol.
Hey, listen to what you want to listen. This is just my review, for God's sake.What Gaspar Noé should understand is that filming people on drugs doesn't make either a story or a good movie.
Or maybe with less that 20 characters, like Blow or Fear and loathing in Las Vegas, or his own movie Enter the Void...
Why would spend time with characters if we won't follow them again ? Why filming 5 minutes of random people instead of creating good characters and follow them ?
Have you ever heard of character development ? Of course you did Noe, because Enter the Void is amazing, so what in the hell happened here ???My 3 stars belong to the director of photography. The camera roams around the characters and gives a surreal, dreamy atmosphere which relates to the drugs.
It's the only interesting thing in this movie. Camera work.Acting is hysterical and really tiring.Structure is like this :
20mn dance
Some credits (???)
2-hours unwanted drug meltdown.
Fun fact : I wrote 2-hours but I just verified and it's actually 1h36. That's how boring it is !
And all of this interrupted by weird statements on black screens, which add nothing to the movie except satisfying artsy weirdos from cinema critique.I like the esthetics of dance in cinema...but this one is grotesque. It lasts like 20mn and you will feel every one of them.Basically we follow a dance club doing a party after a rehearsal. They like sex and drugs...like in every Noé movie. I liked to discover this kind of atmospheric cinema but the story is really getting old at this point.
It feels like Noe is really struggling to renew his work, and find new ideas.
Not only it's still about sex and drugs, but it's not even as good as the previous movies like Enter the Void.This movie is too experimental to be a good story, and yet it's still a movie with a story and characters.
He should have done either a 100% experimental movie or not. This movie is an in-between, awkard attempt at being artsy enough to go to Cannes festival and still get enough production funds to be released worldwide.There is no climax, at the end they just get to sleep after their psychotic drug effect, and police come. It's ridiculous.

But it turned out to be very different.In addition to horror, I love dance and the first dance scene was energetic and enjoyable to watch, then the LSD-laced sangria kicked in for the characters and there isn't much more to say, other than it became bizarre, dark and very disturbing. Nightmarish and graphic in a psychotic kind of way, not an ""enjoyable"" horror film kind of way.I found the acting to be believable. After all, these people are intentionally weirdos and on the far fringes of society. I don't think they are meant to be relatable. And there is certainly nothing likable about any of them (or the plot, direction, production etc).Some have called this movie pretentious or avant-garde.

I recall reading somewhere that this movie is ""shocking"" and somewhere in the review words like ""it will change you forever"" was underlined and bolded. That grabbed my attention and I put on my watch list.
Yawn, what a bore. No zombies, no vampires, no demons. Not even a serial killer in sight. Someone kicks a pregnant girl, another gives herself paper cut with a blunt knife and there is some semi suggestive sexual dialogue and scenes. These days Disney movies include more sex and violence than this watered down trash. FFS Bambi's mom was butchered right before his eyes.....

Like Lars Von Trier, I'm in a polarizing category of cinephiles where some of Noe's comes off pretentious and over ambitious where his other films are hypnotic and captivating. Fortunately, Climax ranks as the most white-knuckle film experience I've had in a very long time.Climax has a formula that is very, very difficult to achieve: being groundbreaking in its stylization; a phantom-esque style of the camera just floating around. The shots are less like Into the Void and more like Birdman. Additionally, the film feels very organic. These are characters that don't need to be ""fleshed out"" because they feel like real characters. I was a skeptic when I heard that trippy visuals were not going to be utilized, but I am so glad Noe took the approach of focusing on the characters and how their madness unfolds on screen. If you're having trouble finding a movie that scares you, Climax might be ""the one"" that will finally make your palms sweat. The movie knows how to instill angst in the viewer. I can't remember the last time I let out a huge laugh after a film was over because I was so freaked out. Watch this movie but be warned it might make you feel strange for a few days after.

I generally don't mind slow-burns or potboilers, but this movie goes absolutely nowhere. Much of the problem is the large cast involved (20+) and but none of them are actually captivating to care.The film starts off with each dancer's ""interview"" where they discuss various life goals which goes on forever since they have to go through everybody. Then they break into a remarkable uncut extended ensemble dance routine which is the absolute highlight of the movie and worth 1 solid star.Then they sit and talk. And chat. And discuss. And gossip. And banter. And gab. And confer. And parley. And argue. And converse. And babble. And spout. And prattle. And jabber. And vent. And whine. And cluck. And yak. And yap. And yammer. And yarn. For over a brain-mushingly half-hour!I should've followed my instincts and just left. The supposed upcoming ""climax"" was an empty promise; you would see better drug trips by drawing circles on paper.After another, less spectacular dance-off, people realize they've been drugged and a brief confrontation while trying to figure out who spiked the punch ensues. For the rest of the time, everyone is either wandering around aimlessly or continuing to dance (which the camera spends an obnoxious amount of time focusing on). There's some interpersonal relationship drama that pokes its head out once in a while (earning a couple more points) but nothing worth sitting around for.Don't be fooled by the title or tagline of ""Horror"", there is nothing scary, suspenseful, or rewarding. Violence is minuscule and tame. Nothing gets resolved in the end because there was nothing put forth in the first place. Go outside and stare at the sun instead.",Climax
108,briefexistance,masterful cinematography,9,27 October 2019,"As many others have said, this is a movie I don't ever want to see again. At some point, when the craze its at the highest; you became claustrophobic and anxious, where the director purposefully makes you part of the madness. Nonetheless, their harsh themes, terrifying camerawork, alarming relationships, subtext charged with political/sociological critiques and frightening dance choreographies, made me appreciate quite a lot this film. More than a film, this is a unique experience you will never see in another work, like, NEVER; the lens throughout we're driven in this hellish pseudo-high school dance is dominative, eats-it-all in a kind of magisterial way.I really admire and praise the technical skill and intensity poured into this artwork. Without hesitation I would say this is a horror movie. idk why, people in the US are very accustomed to ""horror"" in a tacky format; with dull plot lines, one dimensional characters, lacking soul, full of cliches and cringy psychopaths (without its honorable exceptions, obviously). THIS, is another thing. Like, it shows the degradation of the human soul in a traumatic, terrifying and very scary format. This is real horror, citing Sartre: ""Hell is others"".Gaspar Noe gives us here not what we want, or what we knew we want, but what it's needed. Art and more specifically, cinema needs to keep pushing the boundaries of storytelling, and this is a masterful example.I understand not everyone will see it in a objective lens; but if you do, prepare to be thrilled, shocked, amazed and terrified.

""Slow build up to ending"".IntroductionClimax is a 2018, Drama and Horror movie, according to IMDb. It's produced in France, which mandates watching with subtitles on, if indeed you only speak English like me.StorylineFrom the word go, horror and music themes are suggested casually. Voices and temperaments are clearly engaging, from the opening instant. A clever beginning.
Ideas to be taken further, are quickly introduced, giving you a clear sense of the main movie themes. This provides a hook to retain the viewer. Introduction is slightly too long however.
Following this, things retain interest and intensity, but the plot is slow to progress, which after a time makes things appear tiresome.
Following a slightly mediocre centre, the film progresses towards the ending nicely. Themes such as gore were well implemented here, with despair, stress, profound sadness, fear, and anger. Labelling sections with title pages throughout, also adds something. Not many films feature this.GenreThe progression of horror vibes after the opening was too slow. It took far too long for anything shocking to occur. In parts, the film was more Drama or Adventure focused than Horror, sadly.
From the middle though, the genre became more and more of a Horror, until it actually earned it's reputation as a great film. It was very unusual in it's set of themes, but eventually lived up to it's name. It was in fact, difficult to tell exactly when it became a true horror, but once the whole film had elapsed, it almost certainly did.CharactersCharacters quickly differentiated themselves by their responses to questions asked. This allowed the viewer a way into their personalities, which emotionally seemed nicely variable.
The character emotions were tested hugely from middle to end. As the film name suggests, it does build up to a ""Climax"". It's a shame that the beginning half an hour, didn't provide sufficient horror themes, leaving the viewer only partly engaged. Thankfully though, from this point onwards: Pleasure, satisfaction, fear, despair, grief and turmoil, all ensued. Characters were well portrayed throughout, and really sculpted a distinctive signature for the film. It's one you'll struggle to forget.MusicEerie music from the word go, ramping up to more sinister tones. Contrast used well. Music was a central theme throughout, helping its variability.
From middle to end, the music really develops into it's own. Becoming a haunting backdrop for the horror themes that develop. The overall soundtrack is a real triumph, and very cleverly created and selected.Summary""Fabulous conclusion and profoundly unique"".Follow us: Reasea dot orgTags:Comedy, horror, thriller, horror movie review, monster, monster party, 2018 horror review, gory horror, monsters, clowns, clown horror, dungeons, Micky, reaseaorg, benandthegang, Fossafitness, followus, moviefans, reasonedandseasoned, hey Micky, Mickytheclown, adrift, open water, open water 2, no sharks ?, climax, french movies,",Climax

123,Lockout_Salties,A mixed bag,4,5 April 2020,"Climax follows a dance troupe who spend a night in a secluded, abandoned school in the middle of a snowstorm. When the troupe's sangria is spiked with LSD, the group must find a way to survive the night.Let me start off by saying that this film, on a technical level, is very impressive. While the first half of the movie has relatively standard cinematography, the second half is done almost entirely in one take. It really makes you feel like you're there and witnessing all of these disturbing things right along with the characters. And the dancing in Climax is also excellent. It's engaging, inventive, and of course really solid.However, whilst these are big strengths of the film, it has some big issues as well. Namely, that the first half is quite dull. It's supposed to be building up the eventual madness in the second half, but frankly the film isn't insane enough to warrant sitting through what feels like half an hour of just watching people gossip. Perhaps these scenes would be more interesting if I had some emotional attachment to any of the characters. The opening tries to do this; right after the credits (yes, this film starts with credits for no real reason), we cut to footage of the dancers being interviewed about their passions, vices, regrets, etc. But there are simply far too many for me to keep track of. As a result, most of the insanity of the later half of the film wasn't engaging because I was unsure of everyone's connections to each other, aside from the fact that they were all in a dance troupe. So stuff like the attempted incest later in the movie was completely lost on me, since for all I know the characters involved don't even know each other.Another problem I had with Climax was that it really didn't have any meaningful point or purpose behind it. Honestly, if a film is going to put me through 45 minutes of boredom followed by 45 minutes of chaotic, incoherent madness, I should at least be rewarded with something that makes it even a little worth it. But no. The film ends with police arriving the morning after everything happens, and we see the various states the characters are in. We see this one lady put acid into her eye, which I guess implies that she was the one who spiked the sangria and sent everything into chaos. But since we barely know this character at all, and there isn't any explanation for why she spiked the drinks. We see her with this book on how LSD affects people psychologically, but come on. Nobody on earth would put all of their friends in danger by sending them on an acid trip just for some sort of experiment. Don't get me wrong, an ambiguous ending is fine, but a lack of reasoning behind the main event of the movie is not.The director of Climax, Gaspar Noe, in an interview with Candid Magazine stated that the theme of the film was ""a group of people creating something together and then collapsing."" This, I think, showcases the true intentions of Climax. It is not a movie meant to say anything. Rather, it is supposed to shock and disgust and that's it. After all, I don't even know what Gaspar is on about with the supposed ""theme"" of the movie. It isn't a statement on society/life lesson like a theme is, nor is it even a bare bones description of the plot. A group of people do not create the sangria; it's the mother and the mother alone who makes it. Asking Gaspar Noe the theme of Climax is like asking Stephenie Myer about the symbolism in Twilight. There is none.As far as Climax is in the scariness department, it falls flat because the entire second is a balancing act between being disturbing and tiresome. Whilst the film does succeed in some places, it falls flat far more often. If you want a better movie about crazy things happening to people who take drugs, go watch Requiem for a Dream, a movie that actually bothers with basic storytelling devices like theme and motivation. Just... don't watch Climax.Final Score: 43/100.",Climax

126,ethantoy,A Drug-Induced Nightmare,8,14 August 2021,"Climax is a bizarre film. It's something akin to that of a snuff/acid/horror film. Everything from the first 30-minutes up until the end scene is just pure, chaotic bewilderment. I found myself invested into the film as soon as the title card played out, and sat through it, immensely disturbed yet intrigued. This film is way too abstract for a standard audience, but from what I have gathered on my research with the director; he could care less what the audience thinks- this film makes that clear.I honestly believe that this film provides the most accurate representation of what people are experiencing during a bad trip, or just drug use in general. To turn a topic of drugs and alcohol into a horror film is quite superb and vastly unique. The effects of what LSD or Acid (I don't know if it is specified what drug was used) can do to someone's mentality and behavior is demonstrated quite realistically in this movie. I can say without a doubt, this should scare off eager users from touching these things.Of course, what we're viewing in this film is a far exaggerated 'what if?' situation where no one has experienced these drugs before- except one. All of these people end up on the worst nightmares of their lives; some even losing them. It's a very, very disturbing film introducing the concepts of what drug use and trips can be like for a newcomer. I, myself, will never touch those substances ever- and this film expands on that idea of usage.TL;DR
This is a bizarre take on bad trips. With multiple newcomers tripping out and all Hell breaks loose. Takes about 30-minutes for the ball to get rolling. It isn't terrifying, but it's going to disturb you tremendously.",Climax

Beautiful and brutal.Technically and artistically it is splendid, it borders on perfection, but, the argument does not go that far. Presents a choral cast and then focus on a single character. We know the motivations and fears of the characters through a brief interview at the beginning of the film and through the psychotropic trip.

There is no plot, nothing makes any sense, the acting isn't particularly good, and neither is the dancing. And it's especially disgusting to watch some odd looking woman urinate on the floor.

Climax is sure one of those movies but not in a good way I'll tell you that. The thing is the pace is terrible and by that I mean that the first half of the movie is so unbelievably boring and meaningless, full of scenes of people dancing and talking about sex, drugs and gossip that it makes you angry. I felt so tempted to give up on the movie during the first 45 minutes but I decided to stick on it since I was assuming that some action was building up and I was right. The second half is full of desturbing scenes of people doing crazy and violent stuff, blaming eachother, dancing (again), screaming (all in all it's a complete mess). I really enjoy intense movies but this is something else. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone for the simple reason that the first half is boring and the second half is so disturbing that it's impossible to go through without cringing to the whole craziness of it all. If you hate yourself and you want to watch something that is going to make you feel terrible and empty then watch this movie.

That's pretty much all one can say without giving away the hallucinatory horrors that await anyone who decides to watch this movie.At first, the film was so sexualized that it seemed to be building into some gigantic group orgy or something. Much to my surprise, it goes the complete opposite direction and goes into full-on nightmarish horror land where people are locked outside in the freezing snow, women are forced to miscarry, fights break out, children are electrocuted, and people's hair catches on fire.The real star of the film is the cinematography. Bathed in colored lights, Climax is told within a series of just a few seemingly unbroken shots, giving the film a dreamlike and claustrophobic feeling.

Every little story in this sloppy and gross pastiche is the most simple take on every LSD cliché ever told. Nancy Reagan would be proud of our little French director, here.I loved ENTER THE VOID. The ""artistic license"" he's taken, since, to create half-assed student films from underdeveloped scripts is a complete joke.If this is his first shot across the bow in his declared (yes, actually declared at the start of this movie) war against American Art, he may as well tie his warship up to the docks, now.

It just never stops. Absolutely astonishing, one is left wondering how many times they had to take this scene in order to get it so perfect. Everytime you think it cannot possible get better, another dancer one-ups what was just done before. Indescribable, a must see.Thereafter we watch our protagonist party and talk to each other mostly about who sleeps with whom, a piece that is probably impromptu, and comes across entertaining and interesting in regards to the group dynamics involved.Then we get another absolutly breathtaking dance choreography, this time mostly viewed from top down. Not a single shot this time, but again one can only watch with an open mouth as it gets more and more impressive. Just stunning.Well, and after this it's best just to turn off the movie, or go watch Irreversible if you haven't yet.Because what follows is a forced bad trip where everything that can possibly go wrong goes wrong in a way that ends up feeling artificial, like Noe just tried to shove as many disgusting and shocking tropes into the night as possible. Dead kids locked in the basement? Check. Pregnant girls getting kicked in the stomach? Check. People murdering each other and talking each other into suicide? Check. Incest? Check.We also never really get the promised Climax, instead, the movie goes on for too long (although not as overly long as Enter the Void), before reaching a completely unfulfilling conclusion.Extremely unique movie, worth watching for the first half, just forget about the rest.7/10",Climax

150,etmachina,Drug-shaming conservative garbage.,2,16 March 2019,"This movie is ridiculously stupid and pretentious. The good reviews are baffling.This is ham-handed poser arthouse cinema.Marketed as based on a true story -- which is a lie. After some digging you can find an interview where Noe reveals the ""real life"" incident involved a ""much smaller"" dance party where drinks were spiked and things ""went sour...BUT NOTHING BAD HAPPENED"". OH OK! Noe decided to make club goers into drug-crazed raping incestual violent simpletons completely and totally as artistic license. In most interviews he asserts he just took some artistic license to avoid dealing with the real people involved. That is nothing but BS considering ""nothing bad happened"". This movie is based on Noe hearing about drinks being spiked at some party sometime. With a foundation that vague, it's no wonder the movie comes across like a performer who didn't prepare before they took the stage.It ranks up there with Reefer Madness in the portrayal of LSD and drugs. If you have ever taken LSD or been around people who are on it, you will be confused. It's absolutely preposterous. They act like they are on some combination of bath salts and PCP.The characters are terrible and nasty people. The gay characters act with the same toxic masculinity as the straight characters. Just wrong. It's over the top to the point of of ridiculousness. All the characters act like nihilistic young Republicans, carelessly offensive and unashamedly selfish. These are supposed to be professional dancers deep in the club/dance music scene -- it's preposterous. This is nothing like what the dance music world is like.I was hoping for at least some cool psychedelic scenes to simulate the LSD use, but there's none. Noe turns the camera upside down for the last 10 minutes of the movie. No reason. Ohhhh cooool.Three times during the movie he blasts boring, asinine, glib phrases onto the screen, like ""death is an amazing experience"" or ""birth is a unique opportunity"" -- oh really, Mr Noe? Tell us more you wise, wise man. The birth statement comes across as an anti-abortion message -- it follows characters discussing abortions, unemotionally and unflinchingly, y'know, cus that's how people who have abortions are like. Cold and heartless and open to talk about it with virtual strangers.Midway thru the movie Mr Noe flashes his own name on the screen repeatedly, each time imitating a classic dance music label logo. It's incredibly egotistical and appropriative.The movie has a great soundtrack with real quality electronic music, like Dopplereffekt and Aphex Twin. Someone who really understands and loves club culture curated the soundtrack. And the dance scenes before things ""go sour"" are cool.Mr Noe however does not understand club culture. He made a movie that is an insult to club culture and comes across as a deeply stereotypical, conservative anti-drug movie. The only way it could halfway fly is if there was some nightmare unbelievable-but-true event that inspired it, but there's not..at all. You have to buy the idea that LSD does this to people and that club culture is just a druggy nightmare filled with hostile and dangerous people, which is how it's almost always presented.

In my opinion, Climax must be the second or third best film I watched in 2018. Once again, Gaspar Noe has reinvented his very characteristic style to create another unconventional arthouse film. As most of Noe's films, Climax is disturbing, polarising and highly controversial. Meaning that it's not a film for everyone. Having said that, for the ones that appreciate experimental cinema, this is a must-see.Climax is an absolute audio-visual feast. The dance sequences, beats and long shots are beautifully assembled, creating a hypnotising and electrifying spectacle. As the film unfolds, the characters all fall into a frightening atmosphere of tension and death. Climax represents the multiplicity of human emotions at the same time: euphoria, joy, sadness, surprise and fear. Every frame of this film is composed with amazing cinematography and perfect editing.

Unfortunately, in Climax Gaspar Noé has no story to tell, no message to deliver, just a poor, weak excuse of a remotely imaginative concept to let loose on the screen an increasingly annoying collection of sexual graphic scenes, violent imagery and deranged acts that feel out of place even in the context of the movie. It's just a lazy effort to get all avant-garde critics to come out of their shells and claim it's a bold take from a brave director, a raw experience showing the true nature of humans and whatnot.

154,PeaceGuard,"Modern, long, visually impressive version of ""your brain on drugs"" brainwashing propaganda.",3,19 June 2020,"So first.. anyone who has experience with LSD knows that reactions of characters within this movie have nothing to do with reactions on LSD. In fact, they're a whole much closer to the exact opposite.
Maybe it could happen on scopolamine (deliriant) or on large doses of dissociatives (especially arylcyclohexylamines such as PCP and analogs) or as a result of some stimulant psychosis (large doses of amphetamines, cathinones, cocaine - cocaine is present in the movie, but only few people take it).
So the question arises.. what exactly is the point of Noe to make such an extreme brainwashing propaganda? He has done multiple drugs featuring films... oh wait, or is it multiple films featuring drugs (and sex, of course, he has an undeniable unhealthy obsession with both) and I assume he has at least elementary knowledge about their effects (although does he really? maybe he's just this ignorant/unintelligent). So he does it fully consciously. Why? Because he assumes the general public knows sh.t about the topic anyway?His previous movie, Enter The Void, was better, and, if not for the last 20 minutes, it could've deserved even a 9. If only it would conclude that most of the film was a hallucination, not a Buddhist pseudo-philosophy.
Since then, with ""Love"" and ""Climax"" he has only deteriorated.The general public actually knows how people act of LSD. Crowds of hippies during large concerts in the 60s showed that. People relax, chill, get dreamy, talk, seek closeness (this is the one and only remotely close aspect compared to the reactions in this movie), concentrate on what's going on within their heads without much external activity, sometimes do dancing or singing or just perform normal day-to-day actions.
Here you just have a mass psychosis/hysteria. Nonsensical.

For those unfamiliar with his 2003 film Irréversible-Roger Ebert called it ""a movie so violent and cruel that most people will find it unwatchable.""As for Climax, the extreme violence we have come to associate Noé, is shed for a less tactile subject furthering his experimental style while exploring drug use. This is not to say the horror of incessant screams won't make the person in the next room over wonder what the hell you are watching.Climax begins with an interview of a group of professional dancers. They are introduced through an open-ended format of questioning then a rough cut transports us to the next scene, a dance studio where we linger for the remainder of the film. It is here we witness a dance so chaotic and energetic it can only be said to mesmerize.This is the best of Climax. And once it is over the best is gone too.At the completion of the dance, the members hang around to celebrate their successful choreography with a sangria punch, lewd conversation and more dancing. Unbeknown to anyone or most anyone-the sangria is spiked with a ferocious hallucinogenic.For the summation of the film we witness the effects of the drug and its unraveling of the dancers making them paranoid, belligerent and even dangerous to themselves and others.You will find buried messages throughout the film-messages that are an important part of the dialog today. Credit where credit is due, Gaspar Noé is not afraid of experimenting with intriguing concepts even in the face of failure. But sometimes it is the failure staring us down at the end. That does not mean we should ever stop trying.",Climax
162,kcsariano,"If you've tripped b4, watch this. If not, don't review it.",7,26 July 2020,"Reading these low reviews, it makes one thing clear: these reviewers never experienced LSD before. Or else they would understand the art and depth of this film.After seeing and enjoying Enter The Void, I wanted to give this a go. I knew the premise of the film and was curious to watch it. The interviews in the opening really gave us a good idea of whom we were about to watch in the film. Dance students willing to do anything for dance. (Did anyone else notice the ""Suspiria"" DVD to the right of the tv?)I loved the opening dance sequence. I don't care that it was long AND one single shot. Brilliant in my opinion. The juxtaposition of the dancers being their normal, happy selves enjoying the party, to the slow (slow) build up of tripping their balls out. THAT'S HOW ACID WORKS. It can take a solid hour to kick in. I personally have never had THIS bad of a trip, but have seen people have them. I'm not sure if the amount of screaming in this film was necessary, especially since all of them had a bad trip and not a single one had a good trip makes me wonder. But again, it could happen. I've always wondered ""what would we look like if sober people fake in and watched us rolling around on the floor""... this. This movie IS what people look like tripping. It is a front row seat to a bad trip.Is it horror? Not in my opinion. But the horror of a bad trip and the events that take place? Yes.
Is it drama? Yes.
Is it art? Yes.
Thriller? Eh.I see why Climax can be annoying. The camera angles did get a little too much for me at times, but that's the style of this film so be it.Give it a go if you want to see a movie that goes from zero to a hundred.",Climax
163,kim_smoltz,Bonkers,9,9 March 2019,"""Climax"" is less of a film than it is a visceral experience, and that will immediately turn off a good population of moviegoers who will invariable dismiss it as ""artsy garbage."" If you're one of these people who can't stand films made by ""artsy"" directors, what are you even doing going to see a Gaspar Noé movie?But whew. If you appreciate film or dance, you are going to be blown away by this masterpiece. This is ""Step Up"" on crack cocaine.A group of young people who subscribe to an underground dance culture meet for a three-day weekend of intense rehearsal. On the final night, during their closing party, someone spikes the sangria, and well....best not to say much more.The first 45-60 minutes of the film are made up of impeccably choreographed dance sequences that had my eyes glued to the screen like I had just rail-lined a bunch of Ritalin. Some may call this ""boring"" but I found it to be electrifying and mesmerizing. The music in the film is constant, like you're watching it in a nightclub instead of a theater. Electronic powerhouses such as Thomas Bangalter, Giorgio Moroder, and Aphex Twin contribute to the dazzling soundtrack. After the first dance sequence, which lasts about 10-15 minutes, I wanted to stand up and applaud. Then I forgot that I was in a movie theater.I especially enjoyed the cast of characters, which reminded me so much of my days doing musical theater in high school. If you've done performing arts in either high school or college, you will appreciate ""Climax"" on an entirely different level. The awkward politics of being in such a troupe come out in full force -- while everyone is generally nice to one another, rivalries and furious envy exist in the shadows, in addition to cutthroat attitudes and the occasional best friend / power couple dynamic. When things go wrong after the sangria is spiked, these politics are blown up into a larger than life spectacle. It was a neurotic joy to watch unfold.And boy do things get wild. The key theme once the action begins is pure, unadulterated panic. Gaspar Noé's trademark direction brings us back to the chaotic, irregularly lit sequences seen in ""Irreversible."" The action is so dense. Some keep dancing. Some commit acts of violence. Some have passionate sex on the dance floor. Your eyes and senses are overwhelmed and you have no idea where to look, until a fast camera pan takes you to a completely different part of the room.Speaking of which, the cinematography is top notch (although that's a running theme in Noé's repertoire). You've got all kinds of shots here -- dutch angles, long cuts that contribute to the chaos, even slow inversions that make you feel as if you are in a fun house at the Jersey Shore. It's incredibly disorienting, nauseating, and a whole lot of fun.While watching, I also noticed a lot of similarities to Aronofsky's ""Black Swan."" If you enjoyed that one, definitely check out ""Climax.""The ending of the film seems less complete than it should, but it's really no big deal, and does not spoil or ruin the rest of the film.This is one roller coaster I'd happily ride again, and I'd say it is destined to become a midnight cult classic. Keep on dancing.",Climax
164,sossevarvo,"Shocking, dazzling, extraordinary filmmaking",10,18 June 2018,"Gaspar Noe is an infamous filmic provocateur, who has inspired the kind of aggressive derision and accordant lofty praise that would be the envy of most other directors. With Climax, he is as dynamic, acerbic and occasionally pretentious as ever, resulting in a film that could be made by no one else, and an experience that is utterly harrowing and genuinely original. 
His ensemble is uniformly believable, giving the scenes of utter chaos a sense of gruelling horror the likes of which I haven't quite experienced in any other film. The soundtrack is booming, the cinematography dizzying, the narrative utterly insane and brazen... an absolute must see, albeit not for the faint of heart.",Climax

Tho i liked the second half of the movie, it was interesting ,colours were good and was able to make audience feel like theyre in that place.

So basically, nothing happens.Second half, everyone finds out they have been drugged and it gets chaotic, but again, nothing really happens. There is lots of screaming and writhing on the floor with spinning cameras and neon room colors. The End. I also found the drug depictions really annoying. I don't think the people who made this movie had ever tried LSD because it is NOTHING like this movie. You don't run around rending your clothes and screaming for no reason. You don't suddenly stop listening to reason (the ""who drugged us"" incident). You don't turn into a raging violent lunatic. Their behavior was more akin to bath salts.There are SO many characters, and we know almost nothing about them and the things that we do know about them isn't interesting (mostly they talk of sex). When any of them got hurt, traumatized, or SPOILER killed, I didn't care because I didn't know them.I get that the movie was supposed to be oppressive and like doom is coming but you don't know when and blah blah blah. I was so BORED. I was not ""exhausted"", as some have suggested happened to them. I wish I had that hour and half back so I could watch a better movie.

Unfortunately it is UTTERLY flawed from the start as the director obviously has no idea what it is like to be on LSD. I do and it is NOTHING IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM how it is portrayed in the movie. Ok so if it was 100% it would just be loads of teenagers lying on a floor looking at a ceiling going ""wow"" every 10 minutes but EVERY SINGLE character DOES not act like they are on LSD. Simple as. I therefore spent the whole movie just shaking my head and shouting NO at everyone. And Gaspar.

191,originalchc,Clearly most people reviewing this have not taken LSD in significant amounts.,8,29 May 2020,"I have. And the movie is the epitome of a bad trip which could easily happen. You see, human society is the convergence of many people that have egoistical concerns. It's amazing that we manage to keep this world together despite all the differences. A lot of it is due to law and moral values that are based in major religions but not everything. There is a social contract every step of the way which is crucial for the world to work.LSD is a dissociative. At certain concentration it makes your ego separate from your perception of reality and throws in a decent amount of visual and audial hallucinations. You no longer are you and the world is no longer what it seemed to be. A very real notion that the world might never be the same again visits you time and time again. This can be a very positive introspective experience where you realize the socially acceptable limits of your ego but it can also be a frightening one if you have not been the best person you are. We live in a ""me, me, me"" age where over the top exhibitionism of our accomplishments or just vanity is looked up upon (thanks to popular media for that). LSD cuts right through this mirage. And the movie shows just how horrible it might be if every single person realized this at once, in fear of it forever staying the same. A true nightmare, if you will.Overall, I think that it has both artistic and real-life value but it succeeds in only portraying the negative side of dissociative use. To put things into perspective, there should be a diametrically opposite movie that would show the other side of the coin (inherently positive experience) and, thus, the waking life of our realities would be smack in the middle.",Climax

A group of dancers is recruited (I think) to take part in some kind of dance...thing. I dunno. The establishing part of the story was lost on me but it didn't matter.The first main scene (or set of scenes) are brief interviews with each of the dancers. What might seem tedious isn't as each of the actors is compelling in their own right. They were all naturals.Then we cut to a truly mesmerizing dance sequence that was shot uncut. For once a contemporary director shoots a dance sequence the way they should be: straight on with no cutaways. This is how big dance numbers were shot back during the golden age of movie musicals (the 30s, 40s and 50s). The effect is enthralling, enchanting and truly mesmerizing. Then we get to hear conversations among the various dancers where we get a glimpse of their personalities. Then there's another dance sequence (shot from above!) that, while not as good as the first, is still fantastic.Then something happens. There's a discernible shift in the film's tone and the characters attitudes. Where before they were pleasant and encouraging to each other now they are hostile. Things go from bad to worse to nightmarish. What could have caused this to happen? A force from outside? Were they drugged?Some of the scenes during the ""nightmare"" portion of the film bordered on being silly but I still could not NOT watch. Amazingly the film actually reveals the cause of the disturbing behavior and it is a solid resolution.

However, to those of us who are not so easily mesmerized by gyrating bodies, this movie is quite a bore. If you take away the alluring French accents, I'm quite sure that you will agree with me that the dialogue is the equivalent of eavesdropping on someone's post-party ruminations on a urine soaked subway car at night. There is no horror. There is no plot. There is just an abundance of stupidity masked by bodies and an array of uninteresting relationships, where everyone acts as if they are so liberated, but surprise, surprise-- once some mayhem interferes, suddenly everyone's shadow self comes out to play, and then the audience finally gets to see who's an actual dancer, and who is just a poser.Don't get me wrong. Some of Gaspar Noe's work is brilliant. But this film just wasn't one of them. And someone needs to change the genre, because nothing in this film resembled horror in the least. You know what's even scarier than a bunch of delusional, semi-repressed dancers on LSD?

Unconventional in almost every way, and unflinchingly disturbing as soon as the group realizes what's wrong. Gasper Noe is no stranger to off putting filmmaking techniques, and if you've seen any of his previous work you know what you're in store for.When it comes to the colours, performances (especially the dancing) and immersive tone; Climax has plenty to offer if you're up for the challenge. However, like Noe's other films, the amount of people that laud this as a masterpiece or a disaster will likely be even.The largest aspect that bothers me with this film, similar with Noe's other works, is what is his point with a story like this? Is he just enjoying reveling in disturbing material? There are already filmmakers making much more disturbing films so I can't judge him. However I can't help but wonder what his intent is in telling a story like this.Still I can't help but respect a filmmaker that time and time again makes films that are so deliberately inaccessible and, depending on who you ask, unnecessarily disturbing. But with such incredible visuals and performances, I can't ignore the talent that's on display.",Climax
203,cairnst-94911,Disappointing.,5,8 November 2020,"I had only previously seen 'Irréversible' by Noé - which is a brilliant film despite its repellent subject matter.
'Climax', by comparison, doesn't compel the viewer in-the-same-way to seriously consider human nature in its most degraded form. The dance scenes are well handled, and there are many striking audio-visual elements. But the movie lacks any depth of humanity. It left me somewhat numb - weary, even - with regard to the escalating, depraved behaviour on view. Disappointing.",Climax

The ""Opening Dance Choreography"" is the best one which grabs the viewers attention quickly.
The conversation between the dancers after the opening dance gives a pace to the film's plot.
And Lastly, the 42 minutes continuous long take (half movie) till the end is the horror of the human's.

Gaspar accurately captures that complete unmooring of a bad acid trip, with visceral intensity. Using the camera as observer and an incessant dance beat, he never attempts to replicate the visual experience of tripping (because you can't). What he does do superbly is to capture the utter horror of being stuck in a raw, real, timeless, insanity, where there are no handholds of anything familiar and everyone is reduced to characters acting out of their most fundamental fears.",Climax

With the current events in the world, I thought I could use some artful escapism.. I've been meaning to see this for a while and I remember enjoying Gaspard Noe's intense and disturbing Irreversible.. BUT unfortunately Noe's Climax is an absolute waste. A couple of interesting angles and talented dancers does not a good film make. The possible takeaway of a plot or a message might be drugs are bad...Beyond that there is no sign of a plot. It's mind boggling anyone backed this film.. A24 has made some of my favorite films in recent memory (Uncut Gems, Under The Skin, A Ghost Story, Eighth Grade, It Comes At Night..), all challenging and artful in their own way, but Climax is completely empty trash. The opening dance was enthralling, I thought it might get interesting but only spiraled from there.. Watching people freaking out on drugs is way less interesting than the filmmakers must have thought it was. I almost wish I had left on the ugly world news than watch this dreck.

216,sam-519,Control is an illusion,8,22 September 2019,"Climax doesn't deviate from the standards that Noé has set himself since his feature-length début Seul Contre Tous in 1998. A typically extreme, harrowing and depressing affair, Climax, on the surface, tells the story of a troupe of young French dance students who party overnight in their studio and fall prey to one of their number who spikes the punch with LSD. This results in a number of shockingly horrific situations for the students and what starts out as a fun, innocent evening celebrating their craft and achievements turns into an irreversible catastrophe involving rape, abuse, self-harm and death. But beyond that, like many of Noé's films, Climax is a warning of the transient brevity of life's gifts and of not falling prey to the dark temptations of unchecked hedonism.Climax is directed in a typically disorienting style both in its chronology and its camerawork. The film starts at the end point, rolling the end credits at the start and showing the agonised death of one of the students before going back to the beginning of the evening to present how things got to this point. In this film, as with many others of Noé's, there is a strong focus on camera motion and long takes. After the audition tapes for the troupe, in which we are shown the promising, excited interviewees on a CRT set literally bookended by various tomes and VHS tapes relating to psychosis/psychopathy, the film cuts to the dance hall showing the students practicing their impressive new dance act in its entirety before running on to the start of the party itself all in the same take. In between the interview tapes and the dance routine Noé flashes onscreen one of his trademark blocks of text, this one telling us that EXISTENCE IS A FLEETING ILLUSION. This is a time-honoured warning (for example, in Hinduism the universe itself is thought to be an illusion/maya) but Noé's focus here is on the word 'fleeting'. The good things in life can be short-lived and worth treasuring, and the long dance sequence, which is stunningly choreographed, seems to end too quickly in spite of being a technically and temporally long take. It's so well done that as an audience we don't want it to end.Noé presents multiple themes in the films and this 'bookending' is just one of them, likely alluding to the bookending of life with birth and death. The dance sequence at the start is long but enjoyable whereas, at the end of the film, when the LSD has taken its full toll and the students all 'freak out' in a bad trip, the sequence is painfully long, but this is a sequence which we do want to end but which drags on. Noé often concentrates on the victims' situation and here, just like the dance students, we experience their mania along with them, wanting the scene to end as it draws itself out with the swirling camera movements showing that everything is 'out of step' - as an audience we have as little control over the film's grip as the students have over their situation. But control is also an illusion, and sometimes terrible unforeseen things happen to us, further reminding us that we should make the most of life's benefits.The film is split into several sections of long takes, each one with their own distinct camera style. In the opening dance scene the camerawork is as 'controlled' as the dance students themselves, moving with them, allowing them to display their form fully, not missing a moment, it's almost as if the camera has its own choreography. As the situation in the party deteriorates the camera style changes, and at one point, after a few drinks, when the students have an impromptu dance-off, the camera shows the scene from above, constantly rotating, warning us of the chaos soon to come. By the end of the film, the camera cannot hold a straight shot, rotating upside down, tumbling back and forth, with all order, planning and organisation at the whim of the tragedy we see unfolding.Like with many of his films, Noé uses the significance of colour to full effect. As with Love, he is particularly fond of using red and green, red being of special import in Climax. Whether it's the red of the dance studio floor, the red of the sangria or the red of the emergency lighting, this colour seems to represent a start and end point (motionlessness), the precious blood of life and death, whereas he uses green to show points of transition (motion) between physical and psychological locales. Blue seems to represent a rare environment of safety, like the blue room where two of the girl students make out and calmly fall asleep within, locking out the madness of the dance hall and their partners. When the power in the hall trips out, the lights flash green-blue-green, again representing a transitional state and the end of any safe point where the evening could have been salvaged. White is the bringer of death, and this can come in the form of the snow of the winter outside which slowly envelops and kills a number of the students, or Psyche who spikes the LSD, a tall blonde wearing a short white dress who effectively acts as the orchestrating angel of death. Indeed, as we see her dropping liquid LSD into the whites of her own eyes at the end of the film (which in her interview she mentions her 'flatmate' doing. and the kind of thing which she wants to ""get away"" from), Noé reminds us that DEATH IS AN EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE before the screens 'whites out' and the movie ends. White, a colour often associated with madness, has fully taken control of and put to rest the events of the film. But it's no mercy kill.One of the most important aspects of Climax is the emphasis on the choices we make in life. Emmanuelle is the only member of the troupe to have a child who goes everywhere with her, mentioning early in the film that her dancing life has changed as a result of his existence (another theme in Love). Her son Tito ends up representing her own failing to make the right choices, and signifies her self-resentment. Later in the film when she locks Tito in the transformer room she is fully aware of the danger she is putting him in, and when she loses the key (ambiguously intentionally) she has sealed his death warrant. When he electrocutes himself, wearing the significant red of a situational victim, Emmanuelle can't live with her guilt any longer and slits her wrists, but this is not just the guilt of killing her son, but the guilt of not being true to herself. Locking her self-resentment away doesn't work, and it comes back to kill her because she refuses to face it in spite of her earlier protestations that with Tito in tow, she is trying to make the best of a bad situation. Her words are noble, but they are betrayed by her actions which reflect what she really feels. This is where 'pro choice' and 'pro life' come to have equal significance beyond just having kids. Noé tells us that BIRTH IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY and it's one that Emmanuelle has squandered both for herself and her child. We cannot escape ourselves or our true nature and this is just as applicable for Emmanuelle as it is for Psyche, who escaped from Berlin but was ultimately unable to escape from herself.For those who are well versed in the works of Noé, Climax doesn't offer anything that new: it's Noé in typically extreme fashion exploring themes of life death, pain, suffering and all the ways in which these influence our lives. What's most important is the storytelling and symbolism which Noé injects into the film, showing us that there are signs and warnings all around us in our daily lives telling us to enjoy and savour the positivity of existence. The long dance take at the beginning is similarly savoured by the camera, and us as viewers, and in giving us this indulgence Noé shows us both how fantastic and impressive life can be, but also how much there is to waste if we're not careful or thankful enough.",Climax

However, without cohesion, the special cinematography, lighting and strange behavior did little more than irritate me, as if watching a director who can't decide in what direction he'd like to go. The first act was too long and the transition into the second act was nonexistent. Sofia Boutella shines wherever she is, so perhaps her skills were the saving grace of Noe's jumbled mess of a movie.",Climax

220,darnthatdream,Best one of 2018 and one of the best Horror Films ever made,9,30 January 2019,"Watch first read laterI did not expect this. Fantastic, nearly unbearable. Realistic characters and dialogue. At around the one hour mark, it started to get almost unbearable for me. A mix of consideration for my set row neighbors and laziness kept me seated. Making the experience all the more intense, while, in retrospect, for the rest of the film not adding much more info about the story and development as I had already picked up.In his last films ""Love 3D"", ""Enter the Void"" and ""Irreversible"", G.N. moves around from and between different states of extremes. Which gives you time to catch a breath. He tends to move between pain and harmony. This time, its practically one continuos spiral downhill into some of the worst human actions. ""Climax"" is right to the point for the most part and starts of with a breathtakingly engaging dancing performance. Making most of the characters to be professional or -to be dancers was a brilliant choice, since it allowed to tell let them portray so many emotions, behaviors and experiences in a very special yet authentic and realistic, physical and often non verbal way. Always captured with beautiful and organic camera movements and a great but never ending soundtrack, that contributes to pull you in further, leaving no escape. A real horror trip. Relying neither on the supernatural or expensive effects. All we see is pure human behavior at some of its worst, sometimes tragic sometimes sadistic, under the involuntary influence of some very heavy substances.
They all had their demons (issues and worse) inside themselves right form the start. Definitely one of the best Horror films ever.It is a shame, that it wasn't filmed stereoscopically, at the same time I doubt that in that event I would have stayed in my seat until the end of the movie.I do not want to see it again in a very long time if ever.

I have purposefully chosen not to watch Noe before now. Noe is who Lars Von Trier wishes he could be: dark, subversive, and shocking to the core without cheap gimmicks or an ego visible in every frame.

244,petewentos,Unscripted and Uninhibited Art,10,23 December 2020,"I've always been really interested in Gaspar Noé's divisive use of surreal and unorthodox filmmaking techniques. Climax is no different, and I've come to the realization that it's one of my favorite films of all time. The usage of continual tracking shots lasting minutes on end throughout the film documenting the dance troupe's spiral into madness as the effects of the LSD kick in was just beautiful.One of the film's standout moments was definitely the uninhibited dance scene after the title card. When I initially saw it, I was just mesmerized; I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. The raw energy that oozed from the dancers really came through to the viewer and I can confidently say that it's one of the best scenes that I'd ever seen in any film.I usually favor works that are scrutinized down to the smallest detail, but the spontaneity and grittiness of Climax are what make it stand out to me. If it were to be more structured, I don't think that I would have enjoyed it as much as I did. Overall, the unscripted nature of this film was something I was wary of before I'd watched it, but I'm glad that I gave it a chance because that particular aspect was exactly what made it such a different and compelling experience for me.",Climax

This looks to be a mix of bath salts, meth, mdma and psychedelics with a shot of adrenaline and a violence-inducing substance of some sort.

255,esuriens,Incredibly dull,2,9 June 2019,"I expected an erotically charged fever dream full of twisting paranoia, complex choreography and intermingled expressions of lighting, sound, and visual excellence. You know, something that would live up to the simple yet potentially good premise, and serve as an appropriate vehicle for a movie using dance to explore themes of decadence, loss of control, and fear, all of which can be skewed as inherently sexual.What I got was a poorly paced, repetitive, and above all painfully tedious soup of mediocre and messy choreography, bad acting that was neither compelling or 'authentically' real, some very lazy stereotyping (now with extra by-the-numbers racism, misogyny, and homophobia!) in place of any actual characters or psychological avatars, and some relentlessly boring shots of the same group of people doing the same thing over and over and over again.There are some relatively committed performances, and some very tired 'enfant terrible' tricks that one would assume Noe would have grown out of by now (flipping the camera upside down, putting the end credits first, and flicking up trite little title cards about the enormity of birth and death are just some of them), but nothing really makes up for the sense of wasted opportunity and, frankly, wasted time.The best thing in this film is the lighting, and even that - by minute thirteen of a red- or green-drenched shot of the same hallway - wears its welcome very very thin. For those who can get an interesting experience out of this movie, I salute you. Well done.",Climax

As usual I knew I would get a well shot twisted raw film, and that's what this film is although throughout it gradually gets more intense and feels as if it becomes a dark horror film.The movie starts introducing you to all the characters giving their character traits and qualitys, like a clingy or overprotective brother, a lady who wants to get out of the world of drugs and so on, the way 'climax' manages to, well build it's climax is impeccable! Conducting a utterly unsettling and a beautiful work of art.'Climax' backtracks on its introduction of its characters by twisting them in ways, when spiked their vicious side and true emotions come out, like a clingy brother being in love with his sister and not to mention a mother who's son drinks the spiked alcohol then is forced into the electrical room, to later die to the fuse box, this scene was probably the movies most intense and real scenes with its constant building of anxiety and intensity 'climax' never slows it's pace down, gradually getting more nauseating and fast pasted.My eyes were peeled from start to finish, i couldn't believe this cinematic experience, whether it's the dance choreography and it's weird gripping enthusiasm or unusual style of directing even it's dark realism everything is perfected especially with the last twenty minutes or so managing to feel like a rollercoaster of emotions, visuals, styles and genre.

I saw Enter the Void in theatres and it was an very enjoyable but the sound in this film is as key as to the visuals were in ETV. As I said, it's an experience, into madness, trauma, and horror.

263,ludicroustrumpet,A terrifyingly mesmerising experience,9,6 February 2019,"This film is not for the faint of heart. A truely terrifying glance into a party gone wrong, Gaspar Noe's Climax is as beautiful as it is disturbing. The interlocking storylines flow from one another with ease, the smooth camera work guiding it slowly down a darkly disorienting path. Every change of angle and every movement seemed to have purpose to the visuals and characters, and created a nightmareish sense of dread that continued until the end. Similar to Enter the Void, the drawn out sequences of people dancing around and screaming added to the feeling that the film would never stop, which only but added to the horror of the events unfolding on screen.A truely anxiety-inducing film, it's an experience that I expect most fans of Gaspar Noe will highly enjoy.

In the beginning you put your seatbelts on and you see the thrilling ride (opening scene in the snow) and you get frightened. Then the ride starts (first scene starts). You are going up and you see the beautiful view from out the ride (watching the dancing scene). This takes a while to actually get to the point where you are going down. After a while you go down and go through multiple inversions (some camera shots) and you get dizzy and nauseous (the lsd in the drink are the people now feeling) The rollercoaster gets even scarier and scarier and scarier (just like in the movie it gets terrifier). At the end of the rollercoaster we felt the climax of death. And let's us sink in what just had happened.

269,arlosanchezofficial,A Beautiful and Brutal Experience,10,21 March 2019,"Wow.I've been a massive Gaspar Noe fan since I first watched 'Irreversible' at age 11 (I sure regretted that experience), and was crazy excited to hear he was working on a new movie. A group of dancers drinking sangria laced with potent LSD? And their slow descent into madness is shown through their dance moves? Sign me up!Then I watched it. And there was honestly nothing that could have fully prepared me for the ride this took me on. I haven't been so disturbed by a movie since 'Hereditary,' and honestly, this is kind of on the same level as that movie (for me, at least).From a technical standpoint alone, this movie is a masterpiece. The camerawork is inventive and often hypnotic, and even the sound design and subtle CGI elevate the moods and frenetic energy of the dancers. Speaking of, the dancers all do an amazing job; their dialogue is almost entirely improvised, which makes their conversations feel so natural and real. The soundtrack, of course, is the main star of the film and will entertain you at first, then utterly disturb you when you see how the characters act (particularly the Giorgio Moroder song near the end).Any emotions Noe wanted to convey, he succeeded in doing so. While not every character gets as much screen time as the next, they are all interesting and add something to the film. Every time a character takes a sip of sangria, you get a bigger pit in your stomach. When everyone realizes what's going on, everything goes off the rails and we're subjected to an absolutely horrific and chill-inducing experience unlike any other. This movie blew my mind, I really don't know what to say. I've seen a lot of negative reviews for this movie, and I kind of understand why. This is 100% not a movie for everyone. The dialogue gets graphic at times, there are a few scenes of really shocking violence that some might not be able to handle and there are no moments that alleviate the constant tension once the going gets good. But for those familiar with Noe's works and those who are willing to take a wild ride, Climax is one of the best films you'll ever experience.",Climax

The contrast of the colors and the way the camera was moving made me think of the Ancient Greek literature, especially Plato's symposium.

273,davidepresciuttini,I rarely find something this pointless,3,6 March 2021,"This is a clear example of what I dislike about a certain tendency in contemporary art (not just cinema, high brow institutional art at large), that is, the idea that being crude and brutal, rubbing salt in the wound, can already be considered a form of creativity (if you want an example, search Cattelan's hanged children puppets). I personally don't think so, unconscious darkness and the horror of existence are by now something trivial, we live in a desacralised visual world in which they have become ordinary, part of pop culture, and it's been so for some time too (think of the series Andy Warhol on car accident, that by the way, was exactly pointing to the trivialisation of violence).
In Climax you will experience exactly this empty visualisation of a descent into amorality and darkness, as if going down into a hell where no hope was left. There is some symbolism, here and there, given randomly away, like the huge french flag behind the stage (are we looking at the darkness hidden behind the good appearances of a country? If so, it is a vague and populist stance).
I've read that in an interview that the director wanted to portray the fear and rage people experience when someone imposes them something (in this movie, a psychedelic trip). Well, I personally don't find the idea itself that compelling and I don't even think that many viewers would get it. Instead, I know that many people like it because it's a raw and rough experience, my point is, it's shallow and it's hard for me not to think that it works simply because it draws the viewers' attention with something strong and dark (let me call it a pornography of darkness and violence).
Just to clarify, I'm fine with films that don't have a strong meaning, but I expect them to be truly creative and to bring me to another ""level of consciousness"", think of David Lynch, his movies are not meant to make ""sense"", they can be random and obscure but their eerie atmospheres and distortion of reality are worthwhile watching.

I really tried to focus and absorb everything but the two long (all in one take!) shots of dancing were too difficult for me to understand/stay focused. I see that they really tried to convey an entire vibe, which worked well for the other parts, but the dancing was a bit too much.I also didn't really get the credits in the middle of the film as well as the prologue with the interviews. I mean, it's fine, but I feel it wasn't really 'used' in order to achieve a particular emotion in the viewer. It felt more like ""why don't we put interviews in the beginning"".The rest, i.e. The long shot(s), walking around in the party area and confusedly changing perspective and angles (great cinematography!) was really good. The film 'climaxed' for me early in the last shot when the pregnant girl got mistaken for the one that spiked the drinks. It was really heart-wrenching and the bad trip was extremely palpable. Towards the end it got a bit out of hand and lost a bit of suspension of disbelief (even though it was still well within the possible; I suppose it just happened due to the extremely believable first bit).",Climax

The take home message seems to be a scare tactic against drugs, but these drugs aren't LSD. Really weak and counter effective to what's meant to be a progressive style.The opening dance was alright for a 90s homage, the third act got old real fast.Edit- would've been better with edited character development and story progression than a real time party. It could've combined both and switched styles when the drugs take effect. I felt like I was stuck at a party, wanting to leave.",Climax
281,james-re,"An intense, exhilarating, exciting and terrifying experience.",9,25 June 2018,"I always feel excited and a little bit anxious watching a new film by French director Gaspar Noe. His past films have have included the controversial ""Irreversible"" known for its unflinching and brutal portrayal of sexual violence, the mind bending and psychedelic trip that is ""Enter the Void"" and the erotic drama ""Love"" which features unsimulated sex presented in 3D.
Noe is pushing the limits for not only what Is allowed to be shown in a film but also for what the film medium is capabale of. Unconventional narrative structures, mind bending visuals and camera angles you wouldn't even dream of. These are just a few things that can be found in his films.I am happy to say that Climax may be Noe's tamest film in terms of its sex and violence. And I am very excited to say that it may also be the best film he has made yet. I feel that it's best to know as little as possible about the film before seeing it to have the best possible experience. What I will say though is that the film grips you from the start, and only tightens that grip throughout the running time. The film makes use of one location and one situation and one set of characters to put you in the moment. The excitement and exuberance that you feel during the first dance sequence which is shot entirely in one take will change and evolve throughout the film into sequences that are much more frightening and intense. Go along for the ride though because it is a unique work of filmmaking worth seeing in a cinema and if you hold on tight, you may experience something that is close to an outer body experience.",Climax

284,ethancarmanmoore,Climax (2018): Review,9,24 September 2018,"A group of dancers practising for their American tour celebrate while unknowingly drinking LSD-laced Sangria; what could go wrong? Gaspar Noé is back with his newest, and possibly most accessible, film. Noé has been on a list of directors that I would label 'watch cautiously' ever since I originally saw his film Irréversible (2002) years ago. It was, and still is, one of the most emotionally detrimental films I had ever seen. With his use of amazingly unique cinematography, lighting, and camera movements, Noé immediately peaked my interest. I thought he knocked it out of the park with that film and hasn't matched up to it since. While Enter the Void (2009) is an extremely interesting film visually and conceptually, the characters and story just did not work for me. The same can be said for his film Love (2015).Climax is an extravaganza of dance, sex, chaos, and, the most importantly, panic. It is comparable to one long, 96 minute, looming panic attack. But in a good way. The film reels you in with a wicked-long dance number with blaring synth music and it is honestly enthralling to watch. It is one long beautiful take and it prepares you for the style that encompasses the rest of the film. Noé can make a shot last 10-15 minutes without it coming across as if he is showing off. It takes real skill to set up these complex shots that last for so long and to pull them off flawlessly without having the actors mess up a line or having the continuity be broken. His long takes simply engage you as an audience member and make you feel as if you are part of the situation. It feels natural.Seriously though, beware. This film is emotionally exhausting. It has a way of sticking a horrible feeling in your gut and keeping it there until long after the movie is over. It is a spectacle of a bad acid trip. The actors, camera work, and storytelling make it feel as if you are a witness to this chaotic event that is taking place. Sofia Boutella is fantastic in the film and so is the rest of the cast. Every character feels so believable and honest. There is a lot of information given about the characters within the first 20 minutes or through dialogue which can be a bit confusing considering there is a lot of them and we do not immediately learn all of their names. However, I think that this will make for rewarding rewatches.'Climax' is much more accessible compared to any of Noe's previous works. It is not ultra-violent, nor is it an excess in experimental filmmaking. It is a fairly straightforward story with fantastic performances, beautiful cinematography, and unbelievable camera work. It is by far his best film since Irréversible and may be his best film, period. Although multiple viewings will have to confirm this. It is enthralling in every regard and should be seen for the first time in a theatre if possible. I cannot wait to see this one for the second time.",Climax
285,antimog,Masterpiece,10,23 April 2019,"The cinema of Gaspar Noé reconfirms itself as a unique visual experience, its long-awaited return has not disappointed expectations and brings us back to the world of psychedelics as only he can do.
We are in the 90s and a dance company meets in an abandoned building to practice and have fun. The title is clear, it is a real ascendant climax, everything flows in the right direction until they start one at a time to feel bad and the atmosphere becomes more and more anxious. The reason is discovered shortly after, in the buffet next to the improvised dance floor LSD is placed in the sangria, creating panic, death and destruction among the dancers.Gaspar Noé is a provocateur, a director from whom you never know what to expect exactly, but you know he will be able to enchant you and horrify you. Trying to make comparisons with his filmography we can say that he has extreme scenes that can be traced back to Seoul Contre Tous and Irreversible, which remain his cinematographic apex, and Enter the Void as use of the video camera and theme, so he places himself in the middle. As for the cinema in general, it is a fusion of Salò by Pasolini and Step Up, a crazy combination that works.I think the purpose of this film is to disorient, starting with the credits that appear first on the screen, followed by the opening credits 10 minutes later. I particularly appreciated the fusion of psychedelics and the fully articulated dancers, I am not kidding about hypnosis, anyone who has seen that Enter the Void trip will know what I mean. The physical skill of the actors and their naturalness make their mental failure caused by drugs very credible, regressing in a few minutes to primitive beings and making the climax explode in all its delicious violence. For the rest there is not much to say, we have the usual long and wonderful sequence plans that follow the actors, we have an omnipresent care for the lights and colors, in particular the red, in short everything that was expected from the genius of Noah.

There is no character development after the little intro with each dancer. Only serves to show a few obvious connections or other obvious intentions.The beginning dance sequence- Just these random idiots dancing with almost no choreography or matching styles. Just looked like a mash-up of sidewalk breakdancers or night club hood rats that had no footwork and just flapped their arms around way too much. I was literally thinking, ""Jesus, is this how people dance in France?""The next part got me...someone drugged them with LSD, apparently. But why? Who? You will never know. Nothing happened except some freaked out to the point of insanity and some just kept dancing even though other people were running around hurting themselves or attacking others. The general reaction (exp) would be to sit down and not move and just think endlessly, probably with paranoia, but just finding a safe quiet place to think. Instead, they never stopped the music after realizing someone drugged them. Just kept dancing and screaming and attacking themselves and others.Huge let down. I've already given away the whole movie.Personally, seeing people screaming for help in an involuntarily drug induced state of psychosis and delusion, and seeing the people they plead to just keep dancing to the same beat for the entire movie made me so angry I had to lay down and count to ten once I realized nothing else was happening.",Climax

289,frankparnell,"Intense and effecting, it needs to be experienced to be believed, a truly visceral film",7,18 June 2020,"CLIMAX is written and directed by Gaspar Noé (Irreversible, Enter The Void) and tells the story of a French dance group who's sangria is spiked with LSD during a party after rehearsals, what proceeds is a night of increasingly intense, disturbing and cringe inducing events as the friends slowly become effected by the drugs.I had never heard of this film until it was recommended to me online, and as a lover of the horror genre as well as low budget independent films I was eager to see this film. It's been a few days since I watched it and it is still in my head, this film is above all else an experience, not just a piece of media that demands viewing but a film that is so unrelenting in its violence and disturbing content that it deserves recognition from fans of the genre. The slow burn nature of the film eases its audience into its intense subject matter and only becomes an outright Horror/Thriller around the 40-50 minute mark. What proceeded this was largely getting to know each individual character though conversations with each other or though interview format (how the film is opened), and long, unbroken takes of choreographed dance sequences. This really was not what I expected but it got us familiar with each person's role in the group as well as giving the film a character and personality that many films, especially one from this genre lacks. So that must be the biggest positive of this film, the production design from sound to lighting, chorography to camera work, this film excels. Great wide shots displaying a variety of characters and the repeat shots to show the juxtaposition before and after they have been spiked is truly something to marvel. The final act (the CLIMAX of the film) uses sound, lighting and unconventional camera angles to unnerve, unease and discombobulate the audience, although I was uncomfortable with what was on screen I found myself truly effected and when the film ended it had, and still is having, a lasting effect on me.The slow burn nature of the film however is something that results in a negative for the overall quality of the film as the films plot doesn't really ""get going"" till around the 40-50 minute mark resulting in the film feeling inconsistent and struggling to decide on a tone. This is not always a negative, films like the Nicolas Winding Refn's DRIVE (2011) slowly puts our protagonist into the uncomfortable situation in a way that doesn't make the films tone feel confused, something that CLIMAX don't get so clearly. Although the end result is an exciting and visceral final act and a pay off that is truly spectacular this is proof of the director fully presenting his stylistic flare and unique ability to position his actors and the camera to create a film unlike anything I have seen. To me however, tones clash before the hour mark and I wasn't sure if I was watching a horror/Thriller or a French remake of STEP UP.Every actor who appears in this film really shines in their respective roles; each actor has something exciting to do throughout each act. The actor who really stood out from the ensemble cast is Sofia Boutella (THE MUMMY), who though her scenes interacting with other actors or performing alone really brings her A-game, making me suspend my disbelief and act as if I was witnessing a night that is truly traumatic for each character involved, as a performer this is where she, and everyone, truly shone. The scene in which Boutella is alone in the red lit room, dancing to sitting in agonising fear to climbing the wall made me fear for the characters involved, I later learned that a lot of the film (bar the choreographed dance) was improvised by the actors and cementing Boutella as a born, natural performer.Overall, CLIMAX is unnerving, brutal, and in the end devastating for everyone involved, including the audience, as a film that sets out for that outcome I cannot praise this film enough. Although it does have issues with pacing and tone towards the beginning of the film, the latter half is an explosive look at the effect of drugs on a unknowing group of people with expert camera work, performances and choreography elevating the content, that results in what can only be described in a unique experience and notable addition to the genre. Just be sure to take a walk when its finished.",Climax
290,ejwarring,Best Headache Ever,10,28 January 2020,This entire movie was an acid trip of pure adrenaline. I can't describe it as anything else other than a teen version of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas turned up to 11. Very intense and realistic with plenty of mindblowing long takes and shocking preferences even from the child. The movie never for a second overstated its welcome but this definitly is not for everyone and be prepared for a headache afterwards,Climax

IMDB reports a budget of 2.6 million... Which is absolutely hilarious considering the whole thing could have been done with a couple of iphones and a handful of volunteers, in less then a week, on a budget of like 78 dollars....2.6 Million... haha, what a complete and utter waste of money.The acting is not just bland, or necessarily awful... it was all just pointless grunting, screaming and crying... I can imagine the director yelling "" Ok, I want to see giant, mindless and Violent babies""It was like watching a bunch victims of severe brain truama try to act as unintelligent as they could muster.And as icing on this cake of writhing poor quality and mental illness indulged, the producers were keen to make sure they included some female homosexual sex action, complete with a solid scene a boyfriend being humiliated, emasculated and locked out of the room... the trendy man hating was splattered on heavy.As was the obvious racial bias, with several scenes depicting peaceful timid white people being not just attacked, but brutalized and, taunted and ridiculed... or just attacked by a group and brutally beat down..These types of films are not art, they are not social commentaries they are more like pornography for those with violent, racially biased and obviously very skewed ideas of social justice.While I would never suggest that people not be allowed to produce these sorts of shamefully transparent .... things, nor would I deny any individual's right to watch them if that is what brings them joy, additionally I wouldn't deny that I found this film worse then bad, worse then ""in poor taste"" ...It was like a low budget, student film effort attempting to combine some Reefer Madness era ""cautionary"" propaganda fueled hysteria with extremely far left Social Justice ideas... only it has nothing to do with justice, and everything to do the indulgence of violent fantasies and an attempt to make some sort of social/political statement based on what are apparently severely skewed and wildly perverse ideas and/or opinions.Don't waste you time on this ""movie"" unless you enjoy subjecting yourself to poorly produced attempts at suggestive ""programming"".

Group of dancers having their final rehersal and get into an unwilling LSD trip. The movie start with the probably the best dance performance I've seen in film so far, incredibly well executed, the camera and acting just transitions you so smoothly through that beautiful one-take and together with the music gets you in the mood for what's about the happen. The trip starts and it quickly gets ugly and gets worse from there. The camera work and scenery does a good jon of putting you into that feeling of panic and anxiety, you can feel the man has been through all of that himself. Here and there you got some over the top cruelty, but not the Irreversible or Seul contre tous type of things. If you got this movie on your watchlist you know what you' ll get in this department anyways, so nothing too hard to take. The main girls does a good job, the other ones you can see they are more dancers than actors but that doesn't kill any vibe here, fits the gritty mood.

I have always disagreed, until I watched this movie.I expected some sort of horror show. Instead I got a slow (very slow) descent into madness. While I think the movie could have lost 20-40 minutes easy, I did enjoy it more than I expected. Losing control of my mind is much scarier than an intruder. There's bottomless horror there that you can do nothing about but endure and hope to retain your sanity.The cinematography is never boring. Most shots are long and mesmerizing.

The lighting, camera angles, and long shots are among some of the most effective I've seen in cinema, leaving the audience brutally disoriented.However, that disorientation flows over into the rest of the experience, leaving little more than primal fear and confusion for the viewer. I think that Noe has the technical chops to be among the greatest horror directors in this decade, but needs to connect these cinematic tools to a narrative and message that are as compelling as the execution themselves.If you were to consider that half of a rating is for execution and technical considerations, and the other half for storytelling and narrative, then Climax has a perfect half of the former and falls flat in the latter.It's worth a watch if you enjoy indie horror, french experimental film, or liked Raw (Julia Ducournau, 2016) but felt like it was too linear in its message.If that last part applies to you, please message me.

Take for example the first 45 minutes which is basically one big dance scene - - at this point I would like to note that the dance performed by the actors is easily one of the best group dance I 've ever seen in a movie - - Also here you get to know the characters, the relationships between them and you can hear and see some realistically written and performed dialogues.
Interestingly the inciting incident happens at the middle of the movie, and then all hell brakes loose... paranoia, fear, violence, madness. Gaspar Noé brings us the living nightmare which stands till the ending of the movie. These scenes are like we just watchng the neverending videolog from Hell of the Event Horizon. That's a little exaggerated I know, but that's what I thought while I was watching the movie. The camera scans around the location's every half-lighted corridors and dark corners, and thanks to the director's clear and definite direction, it finds something interesting and scary thing everywhere.

What could go wrong???Let me tell you that this film is not for everyone. Fans of Gaspar Noe will be very impressed! This is a very experimental film with no traditional narrative. If you give this film a chance and watch this with an open mind, you will be impressed with the amazing preformences and the amazing direction and cinematography. If you like films that do something different and experimental I think you will enjoy this film. If you want to watch a relaxing movie this is not for you.There is many interesting character dynamics that the film sets up at the beginning that we get to see unfold throughout the entire film. The film contain a lot of uncut conversations between the dancers which is a very different approach. This film reveals its themes slowly and gradually as the film progresses and begins to become more insane and this film does not spoon feed you. The audience has to figure out what the film truly means and what is actually happening.The never-ending soundtrack is the heart beat of the entire film It is very loud and intrusive that accentuates the very insane mood of the film. The cinematography mirrors the effect of the LSD that it is having on the dancers as it gets more interesting and insane before it reaches its climax at the end of the film. If nothing else, watch this film for the impressive visuals and choreography and because this is technically stunning!This film was amazing!! I would see this film if you like experimental films and if not, stay far away from this film and from Gaspar Noe.",Climax

Plus, there's not much to break down in Climax.Meat and potatoes: Should you watch? I think the dancing is the best part from a visual perspective. The dialogue was very simple and plain. You only get minimum insight into some of the characters, others you won't get any information on. After a while, the camera angles were annoying. I can understand attempting to provide the perspective of someone under the influence of drugs and alcohol but I've seen it done better in some TV shows. Climax didn't seem to really have a climax. You just randomly followed each character through their episodes with only your interpretations of the underlying issues the characters may have been dealing with in their personal lives previously, then it ends. It lacked a thoroughly developed back story and characters development. I didn't connect with any of characters. I will say as a positive, Climax did hold my interest. Mainly, because I was waiting for something exciting to happen that ultimately, didn't transpire.Verdict: Climax reminded me of my college days, when I used to party hardy several nights a week with kids that didn't go to class. Not much different happened in the movie from what I've experienced in those days, but we did know what intoxicants we were consuming (not clear what drug was actually used).

325,dmb-34280,"Simple, Visceral Cinema",7,18 January 2021,"I'll start with saying that I thoroughly enjoyed 'Enter The Void' and found 'Love' to be long and draining. So I went into Climax with mixed expectations.Considering the other two Gaspar Noe movies I've seen, I expected lots of unique camera angles and long cuts. And Noe definitely delivered on that front. The cinematic style lends itself well to the many hypnotic dance scenes in the first half of the movie as well as the emotional breakdowns experienced from some of the more prominent characters in the second half. The music being played for the all-night dance party doubles as the pulsating soundtrack that adds to the overall visceral feel to the film. Two thumbs up for the music.The plot is very straightforward with no perceivable depth which works just fine for what I believe it's trying to be-a cinematic portrayal of a night's descent into chaos. A group of French dancers practice their choreography at a wintry cabin somewhere in rural France before leaving for some sort of international dance competition. Once they finish up their last practice session, the dancers waste no time getting the party started after a long few days of choreography. They jump right into the sangria that, unbeknownst to them, has been spiked with LSD by an unknown culprit. The rest of the movie is mostly hysterical screaming, more dancing, some fighting, and did I say hysterical screaming? Don't let that elementary breakdown fool you. Some might find this stylish take on accidental group LSD consumption rather entertaining. I certainly did.In terms of the acting, I'd score it as average with no major standouts (good or bad) which is a pleasant surprise given that most of the performers are apparently professional dancers as opposed to professional actors.Climax may not be Noe's best work but it's a (subjectively) fun and chaotic, albeit simple cinematic experience unlike too many others.",Climax

330,AhmadAbabaei,From paradise to hell,10,1 March 2019,"Climax is a French-Belgian movie written and directed by Argentinian-French filmmaker Gaspar Noé. It is apparently based on real event that date back to mid-90s. Climax is the insanity, hallucination, and fear of using acid; it has an ordered chaos; it's a cocktail of panic and music that starts with dancing, then reaches terror, and finally collapses into frenzy; it is aesthetically admirable and ethically questionable; it's migration from paradise to hell; it's the downfall of human civilization; it's the realization of savagery. Climax is dance-inducing, dizziness-causing, headache-giving, nauseating, annoying, exhausting, musical, breathtaking, unharnessed, excessive, inhuman, filthy, harsh, bloodstained, colorful, high-contrasted, noisy, thrilling, crowded, torturing, revenge-seeking, nightmarish, abusive, intruding, shameful, horror, inverse, obscure, frosty and hot; it takes you to death.

334,allaman-george,Not For Everyone,10,5 January 2020,"At last I have to review this film. Let me start by saying that it is the most engrossing film I have ever seen. I saw Noe's ""Enter the Void"" and I've seen plenty of disturbing films, but none quite as raw as this. I thought I could never watch this again, after the first viewing, but I love the opening dance scene so much (I've watched it at least a dozen times and it never gets old) that recently again I was compelled to watch to the end with my jaw on the floor. It was as insanely gripping as the first time.I judge films primarily by how well they allow me to suspend disbelief. ""Climax"" - after the puzzling but still disturbing opening scene before credits - starts a little banal, straight up interviews with dancers, predictable questions, mostly predictable answers, but stay with it because it is integral to how the film develops. Then at about 9m is the amazing dance scene. My son is a break dancer so I love this kind of dance. The dance is quintessentially French - unrefined, raw, sexy, chaotic, dirty, sweaty, unbelievably talented. The whole film has that French feel to it - the women don't give a damn and are all the sexier for it. Only Ebert's review notes that this entire 6 minute dance sequence is shot in one take, no cuts to make it more energetic. It is quite energetic enough. But this is an important distinction. This film was made with uncompromising devotion.By this time I adore all the dancers, but now we hear them talking to each other privately and revealing shocking attitudes that they usually keep private. There is no filter here and no moral compunction. I start to lose my affection for most of them, but now they are human, not just dancing paragons. I also start to get sucked in and forget I am sitting in darkness watching a film. By the time ""something is kicking in"" I am completely lost in the film, no trace of disbelief, and I remain rapt until last frame.I did a lot of acid back in the 60's and had some really bad trips but none this bad because I did not overdose. How do you behave when you are completely disoriented, terrified, and confused? The worst in you sometimes comes out. There are scenes where a character sees another character in severe physical and/or emotional distress but the watcher simply cannot handle it and moves on. Sober, any of them would have stopped to sympathize and help, but not in this hellish dystopia. They have lost all ability to connect cause with effect.I've been there. A bad trip is as ugly as it gets, and this film portrays it perfectly. I can completely understand if a viewer who has never tripped doesn't get it, but I do, and I think I am Noe's target audience. Still, the educated viewer who can't appreciate the attention to detail about the bad trip can appreciate the detail and love with which this film was shot, and the talent of the dancers.I felt that most reviews I read missed the point. This is not a film to be analyzed. It is not aimed at the left cortex. Observations about the camera work and acting are helpful but don't address the end effect the film has on the watcher. Bottom line: how did it make you feel? For me - severely disturbed, captivated, grief-filled, horrified, sad. To me that is the mark of a great film.Other reviewers praise Sofia Boutella, who is amazing, but I think Romain Guillermic steals the show. There are scenes where those eyebrows are positively evil and sexy at the same time. But it is hard to pick a favorite, they are all so remarkable in this film.Do I recommend it? I don't know. Noe is known for disturbing films and they are not for everybody. I hope you will watch it simply because something crafted this beautifully deserves to be appreciated.",Climax

For 15 minutes straight. I almost threw up.Overall, this movie is just a pretentious attempt at making an art movie, but really it's just a waste of time and money.

343,buster75219,"Take the ""trip""",9,27 May 2019,"If you made your way through Gaspar Noe's film ""Irreversible""(congratulations are in order if you did) then you'll most likely be able to ""take a trip"" (literally) along with ""Climax's hip, slick and cool French dance company as they spiral their way down a ""rabbit hole"" the size of the San Andreas Fault.
You'll find yourself wanting to immediately compare ""Climax"" to ""Susperia"" (at least I found myself doing) which is quite understandable as Noe' uses the same ""eye popping"", brilliantly shot, red, yellow and green palate from which to use, as well as both film's protagonist(s) encompassing the same paranoiac behaviors as they search for any form of elucidation for the mania/hysteria that engulfs them.
Both directors use the setting of a dancer's dormitory-studio where thing are ""not always as they seem"" where their surroundings are meant to provide a ""safe space"" for each films' characters to dwell in, as well as for the audience to feel a sense of familiar comfort which is, ultimately shattered, to say the least.
Noe' frames his opening ""video"" interviews between what appears to be his favorite books, films, scripts which give hints (if we are paying close attention) to many of the film's cinematic ""winks and nods"" to such directors (Noe's influences?) as Godard, Lynch, Bunuel and Argento-just to name a few!
One of the many videos stacked surrounding ""Climax""s opening ""video"" interview sequence is Zulawski's ""Possession"" (1971). Remember, I said to watch very carefully for the various Easter eggs, hints and homages. It is as if Noe' is begging us to notice his knowledge/expertise of film history and aesthetics as if to say, ""Look here! Did you catch that?""! We begrudgingly witness (Argentinian dancer/actress) Sofia Boutella's descent into madness that rivals Isabelle Adjani's (1981) Palme d'Or best actress win/performance. Boutella thrashes herself, not unlike Adjani, into the claustrophobic barriers of a hellish corridor that even the likes of Dante' would appreciate. I found myself hypnotized (drugged?) not unlike the character's, while viewing most of the film's somewhat relentless harrowing and hideous sequences that are strategically juxtaposed to the Electro-industrial, Hip Hop and Disco soundtrack (download on Spotify-great for cardio!).
Keep your eyes peeled (no pun intended) for the director's insertion, amongst the video stack, of Bunuel's ""Un Chien Andalou"" which serves as a thematic warning that we, like those who originally viewed the 1929 masterpiece, will have our eyes opened ""literally"" to a new way of viewing cinema. Like a Siren's splendidly abhorrent cry luring sailors towards the rocks, we too are seduced by ""Climax""s psychedelic call towards our cinematic gorgeous demise.",Climax

Needless to say not all acid trips need to be dark, they can easily be toward the light given the right environment.
Gaspar Noé tackles a story under Vice Studios about a school of french dance students who don't know how much LSD they have taken because one of the students has laced the sangria bowls with the drug. We learn at the start of the film that most of the students have little to no experience with hallucinatory substances setting the perfect stage for a film about paranoia, madness, and sex. Noé evokes ""bad trip"" drug abuse similar to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas but without the visuals. The approach to the story here is direct as we often see now when the characters are interviewed by the camera and then their stories continue. No CGI in this film to capture the effects of the drug, it is all actors giving their all, which I'm sure was a monumental challenge. Great acting and excellent cinematography keeps the viewer engaged for its 90 minute running time. good luck watching this one. Noé has done it again.",Climax

However a bunch of pro dancers on acid does sound like the start of a nightmare so it sets a tone. About an hour in I started to love it. Then I thought maybe love is too strong a word but I definitely like it. This movie really captured the feeling of experiencing a bad trip without relying on cringey filters or camera tricks. As I left the theater to mixed reactions (a couple talking through out gave the credits the middle finger and booed, such rebels) I felt disoriented ""is this a dream? Am I awake??""

He knows nothing about drugs but it is obvious to me that someone in his life has died of an overdose and he blames drugs. It is only an art piece but it is a fear-mongering art piece. This movie was so misogynistic, so gratuitously violent and anti woman that it is obvious to me that he is kind of a right-wing nut.

The cinematography is captivating. The music is fantastic. The characters are defined. It's a visual and audio spectacle, an exploration of mass hysteria.The plot is a kind of character study, the unraveling and disintegration of who this people try to be. Perhaps it's even a microcosm of modern France with a metaphor for her future.Negative - The acting is not the best but it's believable enough, the actors had passion for the project and you can feel it.

At the beginning it was difficult for me to understand this movie ... at first I found the way of dancing of each character interesting, the context in which the party is located ... and I really loved the soundtrack, the costumes and the lighting of the movie; however, in general, this movie made me feel a bit of discomfort that I liked, i don't know why. It was the first movie I saw of this style, which caused me a not so comfortable feeling, but I liked to understand that this is part of our human nature and, if it weren't for some trigger we wouldn't show hidden parts of our interior.

Acting - It's like these people were pulled form midday soap operas. Insane over-acting and unfortunate dialogue that the actors had to work with.
2. Dancing - Some moves are alright, but for the most part none of them can actually dance.

4. Story - After a quick google, this never happened. Not even close - I won't ruin it for you but check on the internet and prepare to be amazed at how far the original story was blown out of proportion. Mind-boggling.
5. Music - Absolutely no audio techniques to create change of pace or mood, just constant generic techno drivel, maybe to create a tense atmosphere but instead resulting in a terrible headache. My ears are ringing 30 minutes after viewing.

I would say that I think its a very good film, but would be hard-pressed to recommend it to most of my friends because I'm afraid that a good portion of them would be traumatized by watching it. There is certainly some kind of draw to his movies but they are very hard to forget and again are hard to recommend to my lighthearted friends lest they have anxiety attacks and/or seizures while watching it.

I guess we all get soft, to some degree, when we age. Just please don't let your next film be an animated children's film or a superhero movie.

Visuals are pretty interesting and the emotions he wants to create to the viewer work their way through, respect to that. The actors and the approach is pretty awesome as well. Everything is in very high level until the drug frenzy kicks in... This part is so pretentious and so ""made to shock"" and ""made to discomfort"" and trying to make a difference, that it actually turns out to feel baddly thought and fake. Such a shame, it could have been a nice movie. Even the whole concept idea is off.
YOU CAN'T MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT A CERTAIN THEME WITHOUT HAVING LIFE EXPERIENCE ON IT. Clearly Gaspar has no idea or experience on LSD. There is no type of LSD that would have those effects... And what's with the upside down thing... seriously...?
Make some upside down shots, make some upside down transitions, I get what he is trying to do..., ok we got it, you want to depict a hell-like situation, but my friend don't do half the movie upside down just to supposedly create fake tension to the viewer. This shit is unwatchable. It reminds me when amateur filmmakers shake the camera on purpose to make an explosion feel more powerful.. hahahahha... which is always an absolute fail.

For me, the soundtrack is on the nose for electronic music fans, but hearing the last few minutes of Aphex Twins 'Windowlicker' swim in and out of the chaotic action so nonchalantly is just, so dope. He treats the rest of the soundtrack with such gravity. You barley even notice seminal tunes over what you are being subjected to visually, yet they are driving.To keep it brief, it hurts, (it's obviously not LSD), it's great and what I hope this guy can be able to continue to push, as he is of few in the position to keep cinema dangerous.On a side note, the intro interviews framed in the television and surrounding films are great fan service, because I believe it's one of the more subtle of Noe's infamous warning tableaus.Cheers!",Climax

The intro had nothing to do with what happened next in the movie (I was expecting at least some kind of connection).

402,jah298,Shocked by how bad this was,2,17 March 2019,"I think this may be the first IMDB review I've ever written. But I am so baffled by the high praise for this movie, I have to give my opinion on this movie.First off, I saw Irreversible by this director over 10 years ago, and that movie was somewhat traumatizing to me. I actually had to look away during a couple different scenes and I never feel so repulsed by something in a movie that I have to look away, so that's saying something.I heard only great things about Climax, and was cautiously excited to see it, mostly looking forward to how crazy it seemed it would be but also mentally preparing myself for anything that could possibly happen.Then nothing happened. The very first (really last I guess) scene with the snow and person writhing around was the most interesting part of this movie, and we see that scene in the trailer. The dancing was cool, but gets tedious after awhile. It took forever for whatever the drug was (they mention LSD I think? But the way it makes them act doesn't really make sense) to kick in, and when it does, it's still tedious and just silly. I was hoping Gaspar Noe, the director, was going to film it in a way that made the audience almost feel the effect of the drug too, but his upside shots and shoddy handheld camerawork didn't bring me into the trip at all. I felt like I was watching mostly bad actors who've never done any drugs try to act like they were on drugs. The violence was very tame compared to what I was anticipating.When it was over, I actually apologized to my husband for asking him to see it with me. We were both really shocked how bad and boring it was. I should have learned by now that review aggregators are not to be trusted, yet I still believed the baffling hype.",Climax

408,jbtank-583-732416,Psychedelic Dance Horror Shouldn't be Boring,3,16 September 2019,"I love Enter the Void, and generally respect Noe for taking chances and getting out there, but this was mostly bad. Dance sequences are well done. I wondered if the dialogue was improvised, because some of it seemed really forced and unnatural. It turns out I was correct and much of it was improvised. Was expecting to be able to identify a protagonist, but even that was hard to do for sure. The film's depiction of what lsd does to people and how they'd react in a scenario like this is way off and there's just so much behavior in it that doesn't really makes sense or stays unexplained. It never feels scary or horrific or terrifying, just confusing as to what the characters' motivations are at any given moment.The cinematography is well done, but some of the creative choices visually seemed amateurish and unnecessary-a very long shot done upside down for no apparent reason, for example. Whereas Enter the Void-same DP-had profoundly unique and original shots that made sense in the context of the story AND were visually spectacular. Not having more interesting psychedelic visuals in the context of a plot wherein everyone is on acid seems like a lot of missed opportunities and may have made it more interesting since there's not a lot of plot to go on. Music is solid, but it seems they could've used it better to reinforce the action of the scene, while in this case it's basically just playing along. Could've gone with some deeper and weirder tunes that'd be more indicative of the time and place, while these are all fairly mainstream and well known songs.Overall, it's pretty boring and lacking in plot. There's no real reason to care about any characters except for maybe the kid. Seems like it could've benefitted from a real script and just more effort put in in every department.",Climax
409,specialkrp,Another heck of a trip by French auteur Gaspar Noe,7,3 March 2019,"I was glad to hear when Gaspar Noe released a horror film finally last year in 2018. His previous titles with the exception of Love were almost in the horror genre at times, especially his first 3 films. To me his third film, Irreversible is a genre bender of horror, suspense, drama, and romantic genres all rolled in 1 with an artistic flair that was inventive and most definitely a unique 1 of a kind film. So I was very eager to see what he had in store with Climax since most of the early reviews classified the film as horror, and I'm a horror fanatic. Climax is a psychological horror film to me with a simple storyline. A dance crews party goes from partying, fun, and dancing to a trip through hell after lsd spiked sangria is ingested by everyone there. The first half of the film is mostly dance numbers with little character introduction. What ensues in the second half is nightmarish and unsettling at times especially if the viewer has ever had a bad experience or a bad trip with use of drugs. The film is nowhere near Noe's more violent films in the past, but still has a feeling of dread especially in the second half of the film. The film is supposedly based on a true instance from 1996 in France so is said in the opening credits. Climax has a few similar like scenes that Hint of 2 of his previous films throughout that I've found. The trippy visuals that hints of Enter The Void , and a few scenes of a character walking down a red tunnel that can only remind the viewer of the most haunting red subway tunnel rape scene from his masterpiece in my opinion, Irreversible. The film is not one of Gaspar Noes best by far but it is still a film to experience just like the rest of his body of work.",Climax

414,drakospanagiotiss,I was hoping for more...a little bit disappointed.,4,4 May 2019,"First of all, at the first hearing of the scenario and idea, was looking very interesting.
I was anticipating to see Gaspar Noe's view of such an intriguing story.
The results was far from good, unfortunately.
I believe that we can see the result of a 4 pages script, full improvisation and a professional dancers cast.
Lot of dancing, sometimes was good, most of the times was boring and waited to see where it was leading. Unfortunately nowhere.
The worst thing is that the whole acid trip experience was badly given. Over reactions, exaggerations etc. I know that he wanted to give the chaos, and the return to raw human instincts, This is what I also wanted to experience, but I'm sorry with no success.
I am curious, if this movie is accepted better from people that never had substances experience, and watch it from a clean perspective.
Also one more thought is, if the negativity about this movie from people that had experience with hallucinogenic substances, is coming from the fear of a bad trip for themselves (in the past experiences).
But again these two are just philosophical/psychological questions,
the result was not good.
I'm sorry Gaspar, I am here to support you on your future movies!!!",Climax
415,kwaiglindsay,"Impressive, bold and deliberately uncomfortable.",8,26 February 2019,"From start to finish the film was thematically impeccable but perhaps too uninteresting. A hell-on-Earth scenario that highlights how easily humanity can get complete chaos with the simplest of changes. It's not a film I'm ever going to watch again as there is no subtlety in the way it was made, but am glad I experienced it. It is literally a story told in two 45-minute halves; the first a character build up with solid editing, cinematography and choreography. The second half a terrifyingly exaggerated experience which, whilst competently filmed, deliberately relies on tension that the film expertly dishes out in a very gradual way. An extremely enjoyable but uncomfortable watch. Not for everyone.Other notes: Glad that the film wasn't too explicitly sexual as it would have seemed gimmicky. The violence is definitely tamed down from this director and it's good to see he doesn't need it to make a great film. The overhead shots were the best scenes. The wardrobe seemed really fitting to the individual personalities. The sound editing actually stood out as the music could have been droning but it wasn't.",Climax

Climax, for me, was dull and predictable. on first discovering Noe, I was invigorated by his fearless approach to filmmaking, his choices in content and texture were exciting and straddled the realms of decency and the taboo. I would always seek out his newest creation, until now. Climax seemed like a lazy and confirmative tick box exercise that never really gets out of the gates. It neither disturbs or delights, or tackles anything that I would normally flinch at, this is what I expect to see when buying a ticket to a Noe film. Red backdrops are now boring, I get it, red means danger, love, sex, blood etc etc. pumping pulsing soundtracks are there to disorientate and unsettle, boring, next, move along. drugs drugs drugs, erect dicks and maturbation, need I go on.

It manifests itself as a disturbing thriller but in fact it's a horror musical. The film incorporates many different elements of the musical genre to extenuate the psychedelic effect that is experienced by the characters.Much like your typical musical there are extended sequences of dancing to music, in creative ways which is the actual appeal of the scene in addition to bringing characterization to each character with their own unique way of dancing.Although the film has an extra narrative appeal, the film takes place over a crazy night with a bunch of crazy people high on LSD, and about a few minutes in someone dies. so it gains that feeling of a battle royale psychological narrative of trying to manipulate the group. where each character ends their story is one of the most interesting elements of the story, with everyone by dawn having a very different experience but the viewer getting to see what each of them got by the end.climax is awesome go see it",Climax

Dancers aka bad actors(so much overacting here) taking acid and freaking out in a bad trip....Oh and quirky lighting and rotating camera angles that's all. Supposedly an experience rather than a movie but believe me Noe and sooo many others have done so much better at delivering an experience rather than some dark lighting and the classic upside down camera... It would've been better if he just gave some E or acid to the actors and just observe and tape the reactions.

But what starts as the night they will never forget turns into the one i wouldnt wish on my enemies. Climax starts with interviews with everyone involved; which shows they all relatively have ulterior motives into and absolute descent to madness and a nightmare all in its own. The last 30 mins will leave you speechless as its shot dark and mostly upside down with way more than most people would care to see. But my girth of horror films would be a testament to that.

Through atypical technique which he masters terribly good, with psychedelic visuals and a heavy but dynamic load of suspense, succeeds to put in image the violent creeps of the world hidden in the human mind at certain moments of implacable delusion.
Important in this film is the hue - the contrast between the white of snow outside and the wild colour inside, the neon cinema which spread shades of reddish darkness (like a bleeding nightmare running through the hallways), the racial and sexual diversity. The whole dance floor looks like a sangria - the drink that represented the center point, the mechanism that made everything spin in a chaotic circle of dementia.
The eye of the camera reveals incredible dance skills, a hypnotizing choreography and the paranoia that grows in intensity to climax.
Life and death presented as terrifying experiences and the endless music that maintains an exhausting atmosphere, make you remember this movie a long time, make you live with it, love it, but did not want to see it again.

And also make you feel part of the movie with a camera focus everytime of the film. It was a uncomfortable movie to watch but is part of a genre that is not for everyone.The photography reminds me Dario Argento, and the psycho to Darren Aronofsky.",Climax
445,scottpslater,Horror for the X-Factor generation,3,2 March 2019,"With Climax Noe injects all his trademarks with good effect, such as 'out of the comfort zone' themes and stunning cinematography and effects. However, where these are used to great effect with titles such as 'Irreversible' and 'Enter the Void', with Climax they are the only elements worth mentioning. The afore mentioned films had a lot more going for them, where Cilmax, seems to me, to fall flat. The first hour of the film is full on ITV Saturday night mainstream entertainment. Great fun for the lovers of X Factor etc, no doubt. The characters are also 2 dimensional and not very likeable, were the only topic and conversation seems to be about sex. Now I know most of the characters are young and they are placed in a party scenario, but this doesn't lead to a very engaging script or narrative. If you like your horrors full of dull (in my opinion) street dancing, this is the one for you....just dont expect much depth....",Climax
446,maciek4,Terrible film,1,29 October 2018,"I understand that this film is for certain type of audience. Perhaps you have to view it on LSD to enjoy it. To me it was simply boring. You go to the cinema to be entertained, not bored. At the end of the film I could hear people laughing and asking ""what was that all about?"".",Climax

448,50m31,Boring movie with embarrassing dialogues and unsympathetic characters,2,9 April 2021,"The movie begins with footage of interviews from the movie characters about dancing been shown on an old crt-tv. Then a long scene of them dancing is shown.The rest of the first half the characters are basically talking about who they had sex with and who they want to have sex with. These dialogues would even be embarrassing for movies like American Pie.Then after around 45 minutes into the movie the effects of the drugs begin to show. But apart from aggressive and stupid behavior of the characters nothing really happens. They just argue and fight with each other until the movie ends.Not a single one of the characters was sympathetic in any way, most of them are completely unsympathetic.",Climax
449,thevenom-78014,The most fantastic sensory overload you could watch,10,23 September 2018,A movie filled with an extreme vision of what being on drugs is like and what can happen when a group of people dont trust eachother and how they all deal with being high. Gaspar Noes best film for sure. If you like movies that give you a feeling of being uncomfortable and also intrigued this movie is perfect for you.,Climax
450,cbrune-21369,Climax is a climax,10,9 March 2019,"It's pretty sad, that only a couple of theatres in Germany showed this film. For me it was the most excellent and entertaining movie experience in 2018. Choreography, camera, music, lighting and story meshed in perfect harmony to drag you into a thrilling horror-trip. It actually feels like you are tripping along, knowing things will get worse and more intense with no chance of coming down. Each of the characters can be found at any party in real life and their feelings are portrayed in an authentic way. The fact that the actors are more professional dancers than actors plus the short script make it so realistic. Especially the camera seems to move like it's intoxicated as we know from 'Enter the Void'. The soundtrack is well chosen, with songs which makes you wanna dance, but also get more and more terrifying. The songs recorded on vinyl and the volume decreasing when we move away from the speakers add to the atmosphere. All in all this film is disturbing, a classic Noé. Not as morally shocking as 'Seul contre tous' or 'Irreversible', thus way scarier. It was a pleasure to watch such a piece of cinematic perfection. Can't wait for the BluRay to come out!",Climax
451,yiotah,A subjective love/hate(er)... but could have been sublime!,4,29 January 2019,"Whilst as I can completely appreciate the cinematography, direction and (most impressive) the choreography this had the potential to be a truly well rounded and rather original horror movie. Unfortunately for me, even before trying to realistically portray something that is so personally subjective as a bad reaction to a hallucinogen, there's the strong argument against having actors spend excessive amounts of screentime screaming and moaning at the camera... All in all, worth a watch if you can make it past someone losing the plot and screaming for what feels like ten minutes.",Climax
452,uteuweberndt,Bad Trash Movie,1,20 February 2019,"This movie is useless and the cost would have been better donated to cancer research. The actors all come over as if they can not count to three. You can not even call this movie a B-movie. this is certainly located at the end of the alphabet. Again, a fil for the Mülltonne.Die actors in the beginning hop around there, what should that be? If something is called dance the duden and wikipedia have to revise the definition of dance. So I have not even moved in a frenzy like these idiots there, probably find themselves doing even the best in the world. Impossible to produce such a thing, but as everyone knows, the film industry suffers from a lack of taste.",Climax
