0,Leofwine_draca,A noisy and satisfying piece of entertainment,7,22 October 2013,"DREDD is the second adaptation of the cult comic book series Judge Dredd, following on from a poorly-received Stallone flick in the '90s (for the record, I thought that version was passable but weak in places, as is the case with a lot of mid-'90s cinema). This one's a lot more gutsy and compelling, thanks to the lean script and emphasis throughout on bloody action and adult entertainment. No pandering to the teenage crowd here.Karl Urban, long since a favourite of mine (since his excellent turn as the Russian assassin in THE BOURNE SUPREMACY) headlines as Dredd, never taking his helmet off throughout the film. Thus he's reduced to acting via his chin and gravely voice, and the surprise is that it works, to a degree. The helmet serves to distance the viewer from warming to the character, but then that's the point. I did like him though, and enjoyed his totalitarian attitude towards keeping crime off the streets.Many reviewers have commented on the movie's similarity in plot to the Indonesian action epic THE RAID, and it's clear the two films share plenty. However, I think there's space for both of them in the market; DREDD is an unashamed shoot-em-up while THE RAID is an unashamed martial arts movie. They cater to different markets, and both are equally good.DREDD's grim, claustrophobic setting is a strong one (bringing to mind the likes of '80s nihilist cinema like TENEMENT and DEATH WISH 3) and the action never lets up from start to finish. The scene with the huge guns is the stand-out, of course, but there's plenty of good minor stuff along the way, where encounters between Dredd and various bad guys are well directed and choreographed. Lena Headey's villain is utterly imposing and my only disappointment was with the ultra-slow-motion sequences, which are a bit pretentious and overused; thankfully they virtually disappear once the novelty wears off. I watched the 3D version of this movie, and while it's not the most visually impressive 3D film I've seen, it does make the film feel more immersive as a whole.",Dredd
1,SnoopyStyle,Perfect Dredd,8,11 August 2013,"In a dystopian future, the world is devastated. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is the last word in Law & Order within Mega-City One. Judge Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) is his junior partner. They are battling drug lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) who is operating out of a massive apartment block.The previous version of Judge Dredd (1995) starring Sly is a campy affair. Consider that it had Rob Schneider in it. 'nuff said. This one brings us into the comics once again but this time, they drop the camp. It is well written probably because they had Alex Garland who also wrote 28 Days Later... and Sunshine among others. Karl Urban is not as imposing as Sly but he does a solid job. Most importantly, he's not impersonating Sly. Olivia Thirlby is great as a foil or conscience to Dredd. Their relationship is the heart of the movie. Lena Headey does a good job as the baddie. It's an interesting unusual choice. It's certainly not your average muscle bound villain.I did have 2 problems. First, Slo-Mo happens too many times. The first couple of times are interesting. I'm sure it's cool 3D fun, but even that would get tiresome. It's a balancing act between pace and cool and the climax needs pace more than cool. Second problem is the ending. The final fight with Lena Headey is not as climatic as needed. It's a bit of a letdown. Overall, this is super-fun despite the minor problems.",Dredd
2,Prismark10,Urban raider,5,5 August 2016,"Dredd forgoes the colourful big budget art direction of the 1995 Judge Dredd film. Instead it is a film set mainly in the interior of one of the Mega Cities, a cesspit where law and order is attempted to be maintained by the all powerful Judges who act like judge, jury and executioner.Karl Urban is the best known and the most feared Judge Dredd, the always helmeted lawman assigned to evaluate a rookie Judge Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) who has psychic abilities.They go out to apprehend evil drug empress Ma-Ma (Lena Headley) who skinned three men and threw them off an high rise while induced with a slo-mo drugged which means they experience the fall in a slowed down reality. However when Dredd and Anderson go to the 200 storey complex, it is locked down and they are trapped inside as various bad guys go after them.After that you realise he film is an inferior version of The Raid without the nifty martial arts despite some good visual effects which is delivered in a modest budget. The film is ultra violent and bloody, there are grotesque sequences of corpses falling slowly to the ground but the film has a thin plot, is slightly repetitive and lacking the grim, dark humour of the comics.",Dredd
3,claudio_carvalho,Bringing Justice in the Future,7,12 January 2013,"In the future, the overpopulated and chaotic Mega City One with 800 million inhabitants occupies the former territory between Boston and Washington and is surrounded by desert. Justice is brought by the judges, who have the power to judge and execute the sentence against those who break the law.The incorruptible Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is summoned by the Chief Judge (Rakie Ayola) to evaluate the rookie Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), who has failed the test for judge but is a mutant with psychic abilities. They witness a murder and chase the killer in a 200-floor building. However the laboratory of slo-mo of the drug lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) is located in the 200th floor and she seals the building, trapping the two judges inside. Then she orders her clan to kill Dredd and Anderson in the beginning of a gore manhunt. ""Dredd"" is an above average and full of action sci-fi movie. The story is very simple, but supported by a great cast and excellent action scenes. The result is a great movie. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Dredd, O Juiz do Apocalipse"" (""Dredd, The Judge from the Apocalypse"")",Dredd
4,nogodnomasters,"JUDGE, JURY, AND EXECUTIONER",8,5 August 2018,"The film takes place in a futuristic society after much has been destroyed with atomic radiation. Law enforcement officers are called Judges as they act as judge, jury and executioner. Society is attempting to regain law and order, but is losing. Drugs compromise the largest aspect of law enforcement. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) whose face we never see, is cold, calculating, and strictly by the book enforcer. He is assigned a rookie (Olivia Thirlby) who is a mutant and has special mind reading powers.When a triple homicide happens at a block high rise, our duo goes to investigate only to uncover a large scale drug operation. The drug is called ""slo-mo"" and gives one a slow motion sensation which adds to the special effects as we get to see plenty of slow motion killings.At this point the feature becomes akin to a video game where our two judges must ascend a a locked down high rise clearing out levels in order to reach Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) the leader.There is plenty of action. In fact the film is almost all action. The sound track was fast paced. Along with the heavy action and blood, one could claim this was similar to a Tarantino grindhouse. Parental Guide: F-bombs, brief sex, brief distant nudity (?), lots and lots of blood and some brain splatter.",Dredd
5,kosmasp,Not Dredd-ing around,7,3 August 2015,"Maybe this helped wipe the first Judge Dredd movie out of my head, but I really don't remember that anymore. I just came around watching this, because I wanted to watch this in 3D. And it has some very nice effects in it (also very violent and some graphic scenes too). So it really was a joy to watch, though having seen it, I don't quite get why people would confuse or compare this with The Raid movie. Apart from the one location deal and the good versus bad, the shooting style is very different and both movies can exist and be seen.Having said all that, apart from the visual joy you'll be having, you might be surprised a bit by the performance of Karl Urban. He apparently insisted on ""not being seen"" (helmet), which should make comic book fans very happy. And although it didn't make much money initially it did good business when it came out for the home video market. Unfortunately still nothing on a sequel to this ...",Dredd
6,classicsoncall,"""I am the Law....You have been warned.""",7,16 March 2019,"It's been a couple years since I watched the Stallone version from 1995, but just as with that picture, I didn't think this one was too bad. Can't say one was better than the other, although ""Judge Dredd"" had a more stellar cast with Armand Assante, Jurgen Prochnow, Max von Sydow and Diane Lane in principal roles, whereas I wasn't familiar with anyone in this picture, except for Karl Urban from appearances in some of the recent Star Trek films. Funny, but because Urban didn't remove his helmet at any time during the picture, it almost looked like it could have been Stallone under there, what with the square jaw and somber disposition twisting into a snarl every now and then. There was something almost mechanical about Olivia Thirlby as rookie judge in training Cassandra Anderson; can't really put my finger on it though she looked like she was in a mental zone of her own a lot of the time. I didn't think the story needed her to be a mutant for the psychic ability she had, as there are people who've demonstrated such as regular human beings. The filming style is notable, and because I didn't watch this fitted for 3D, I was baffled by the cinematography of some scenes, but now I understand what they were about. There was some real neat calligraphy involved with the opening credits as well which appeared quite unique, so a fair amount of creativity went into this project. What's curious to me is how much this version of Dredd outdistances the Stallone picture in a lot of key metrics here on IMDb, ie, almost double the number of viewer votes as I write this, 641 viewer reviews against 240, and a 7.1 rating against Judge Dredd's 5.5. You would think this was a far better picture, and for some it would be, as the violence appears more graphic and twisted. Either way, for fans of this stuff, I don't think you can go wrong with either version.",Dredd
7,gavin6942,Surprisingly Good,7,1 April 2014,"In a violent, futuristic city where the police have the authority to act as judge, jury and executioner, a cop teams with a trainee to take down a gang that deals the reality-altering drug, SLO-MO.I have seen the cheesy yet fun ""Judge Dredd"" (1995) and the legendary ""RoboCop"" that was sort of a detour from what they had envisioned ""Dredd"" to be decades ago... and I thought there was no way this could compare to them. I was half right.There is no matching ""RoboCop"", and I will pretend it was not remade. But this ""Dredd"" has some very likable things to it, and makes the Judge out to be more than just an assassin with a gun. There is still some cheese (though much darker cheese than in the Stallone version). But somehow it all seems to work.",Dredd
8,jboothmillard,Dredd,8,13 February 2013,"I had obviously seen the 1995 version starring Sylvester Stallone, but most of the fans of the comic book must have been a little disappointed, I may not have heard or seen much about it during release, but I was looking forward to a reversion, from director Pete Travis (Vantage Point). Basically in the future America has become a near baron wasteland called Cursed Earth, eradicated by radiation, and between New York and Boston the area is Mega City, a crime-ridden place with 800 million people surviving, away from the desert surrounding the tall skyscrapers. 17,000 crimes are reported daily, and keeping the peace for the innocent citizens is the new kind of police force, those who act as judge, jury and executioner, the Judges, and the most feared throughout the city is the tough and immovable Judge Dredd (Karl Urban). His latest assignment is to train and evaluate new recruit and powerful psychic Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) who did not pass all of her previous tests, he warns her about all the things that will cause an automatic fail, such as losing a weapon and not following direct orders, and they are sent together into a known drug territory. Peach Trees is a 200-storey slum tower block, and there apparently the addictive drug called ""Slow-Mo"", which causes a user's perception of time to slow to 1% of normal, and three rogue drug dealers have been murdered after being skinned, given the drug and thrown from the top floor, so the building is to be raided. Anderson using her mind abilities identifies thug Kay (Wood Harris) as the one who murdered the drug dealers and he is arrested, and he is to be taken away and questioned, but the tower is locked down and sealed with the blast doors and the forces of drug lord Madeline Madrigal, better known as Ma-Ma (300's Lena Headey), stopping anyone from getting out, and the Judges from getting help. Ma-Ma announces to the whole building that the people, innocent and criminal, inside will only be let out when the Judges are killed, so all Dredd and Anderson can do is fight their way against the armed thugs to get the top of the tower to Ma-Ma and carry out justice, and reaching the76th floor the men are armed with Vulcan cannons that rip through the walls, killing numerous residents. While the Judges are able to get back up from other officers breaching an outer wall, henchman Caleb (Warrick Grier) is sent to confirm that they are dead, but obviously they are not and Dredd catches him and with justice meaning that he would be sentenced to death he is thrown from the tower for Ma-Ma to watch. Kay is beaten by the determined officer for information about Ma-Ma's empire, but when he fails Anderson uses her psychic ability to go deep into his mind and extract the facts, that Peach Trees is the source for the production and distribution of Slow-Mo, they could wait for back up but continue climbing the tower. Judges Volt and Guthrie from outside have come to respond to the call from the officers, but they are sent away after being convinced it was a security drill, and meanwhile the two in the tower are confronted by a pair of teenagers armed who manage to take Anderson hostage and take her to the base in the top floor of the tower. Dredd carries on making his way toward her and the criminal mastermind, and corrupt Judges Lex (Langley Kirkwood), Alvarez (Edwin Perry), Chan (Karl Thaning) and Kaplan (Michele Levin) relieve Volt and Guthrie to enter the building, but Dredd gets suspicious when one of them doesn't mention Anderson, so he knows these Judges are not on his side. Kay meanwhile tries to execute the trainee with her own weapon, but her DNA scanner is coded onto the pistol, and his arm is blown off, so she escapes and kills more criminals, while all the corrupt Judges have been killed, apart from Kaplan who shoots Dredd in the abdomen, but he is stalled long enough for Anderson to kill him. Reloading his weapon with ammunition the two Judges finally reach the apartment where the drug lord is hiding, and enter the code to enter, but then entering Ma-Ma warns the Judge that she has a device that will blow up the tower if her heartbeat stops. Dredd is sure though that the signal will be lost if she reached the ground floor, so he forces Ma-Ma to inhale the Slow-Mo drug, and in her mind she very slowly falls to her death, cracking her skull on the ground, the two Judges and innocents are able to leave the tower, Anderson accepts her failure from her evaluation, but Dredd tells the Chief Judge (Rakie Ayola) she has passed. Urban is a fantastic choice as the leading no-nonsense dark hero, and it is much better that he is never seen taking off his helmet, Thrilby is engaging as the new recruit who can read and go inside minds, and Headey with the large scar on her face and completely ruthlessness is the perfect evil bitch. I agree the story is very similar to the plot of The Raid, going into a building, guns blazing to get to the criminal, but it has plenty of original material as well, especially the brilliant special effects enhanced by slow-motion hallucinations, you actually see bullets go through skulls and heads crack on floors with blood spewing all over, it is so violent and so much fun, a brilliant science-fiction fantasy action adventure. Very good!",Dredd
9,Tweekums,Gritty '18' certificate action,9,25 February 2017,"Set in a future where most of North America is a radioactive wasteland eight hundred million people are crammed into the vast Mega City One. Here justice is dispensed by the Judges who pass sentence on the spot. Judge Dredd is a veteran who has been ordered to evaluate rookie judge Anderson; she just failed her exams but Dredd's superior wants to give her a chance as she is a telepath. When they are called to a triple death in one of the city's two hundred story tower blocks they think it will be routine it is anything but. The dead men had made the mistake of crossing Madeline Madrigal, AKA Ma-Ma, the drug lord responsible for the supply of Slo-mo, a new drug. The dead men had taken the drug so Dredd and Anderson investigate the nearest drug den; here they arrest a man named Kay. Anderson is almost certain that he was the killer so they arrest him to take back for interrogation. He knows far too much about Ma-Ma's operation so she seals the building and orders her killers to eliminate the two judges. Unable to get out Dredd and Anderson are forced to take Ma-Ma's forces head on.Anybody who watched the Sylvester Stallone film 'Judge Dredd' may think they know what to expect; they'd be wrong. This is an altogether grittier story; the action is more intense and a lot more brutal and there definitely isn't a 'comedy' sidekick. If one must compare it to another film I'd say it was most like a slightly toned down version of 'The Raid' than any other film I've seen. The setting is suitably grimy and once the building is put in lock down there is a decent sense of claustrophobia. Karl Urban does a great job in the title role; he brings an intensity to the character without showing any obvious emotion. He is ably supported by Olivia Thirlby who impresses as rookie Judge Anderson; a character who develops nicely as she undergoes the intense ordeal in the tower block. Lena Headey also impresses as the villainous Ma-Ma; an unpleasant character who, for the most part, doesn't tip over to become a pantomime villain. There is lots of impressive action from start to finish as well as a real sense of danger while I didn't doubt for one second that Dredd would survive I was less certain about Anderson. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to anybody looking for solid '18' certificate action.",Dredd

The Planet Earth has changed into a virtually uninhabitable place . All of the Earth's population have crowded into the cities across the planet , now known as ""Mega Cities¨ . In a standard comic book dystopian near-future , on its East Coast, running from Boston to Washington DC, lies Mega City One . It is a violent, futuristic city where a new Justice System came from the ashes , the police has the authority to act as judge, jury and executioner, they were called ""Judges"" and dispense justice on the riot-torn streets and buildings of Mega City . The crimes in this ""Mega city"" became so violent and so powerful, that the regular justice system was powerless to contain, then it collapsed completely .

Dredd and Anderson must confront the odds and engage in the relentless battle for their survival .This slam-bang film packs noisy action , thrills , chills , suspense , high body count and lots of violence and gore . Some interesting plotting is partially lost in a sea of hard-edge violence , overripe acting , exaggerated explosions and exccessive shots . The picture is a crossover between ¨Die hard¨ by John McTiernan , ¨Doom¨ video game/film by Andrzej Bartkowiak and first version ¨Silvester Stallone's Judge Dredd¨ by Danny Cannon . The exciting screenplay throws in Femme cop , a likable policewoman well played by Olivia Thirlby as a rookie with powerful psychic abilities thanks to a genetic mutation . Karl Urban's iconic presence is good as a helmeted , emotionless future-cop who dispenses the square jaw-lines and a summary justice. Fizzing visuals , video game-like special effects and impressive production design showing a large megalopolis in ¨Blade Runner¨ style . Atmospheric original music by Paul Leonard-Morgan , composed by means of synthesizer . Colorful , though sometimes dark cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle . The precocious technical mastery displayed by Peter Travis (Vantage Point , Omagh , End game) is extraordinary and he delivers narrative fluidity . Rating : 6,5 .

11,BA_Harrison,Karl Urban IS Dredd.,7,7 September 2012,"I've been a Dredd fan for thirty years now, but I'm not about to give this movie adaptation of my favourite comic character a ridiculously high rating purely from some misguided sense of loyalty. Instead, I'm going to give it a deservingly high score because, quite simply, it is a very good film, one that successfully captures the essence of the 2000AD strip, delivering brutal action by the bucket-load, excellent central performances, and inspired direction, all enhanced by breathtaking state-of-the-art 3D special effects.After the debacle that was Stallone's Judge Dredd (1995), the makers of this movie have clearly made their prime directive to please hardcore Dredd fans, and it shows: the screenplay, by Alex Garland, remains very faithful to the spirit of the comic, and in Karl Urban, we now have the perfect Dredd-all raspy voice and humourless grimace, it looks as though the character has jumped straight onto the screen from the pages of 2000AD (helmet intact). Similarly, it would be hard to imagine anyone more suitable than Olivia Thirlby as rookie Psi-Judge Anderson (and believe me, I've tried!).Is Dredd 3D my 'ideal' Dredd movie? Not quite... made for a comparatively meagre budget of $45million, it would be hard pushed to live up to my impossibly high expectations (just realising the Mega-City One of my dreams would require way more money than it cost to make this entire film). That said, it is definitely a massive step in the right direction, and if it is the financial success that it genuinely deserves to be, who knows what treats await us in the future: The Cursed Earth, Judge Cal, Judge Death, The Apocalypse War.... I'm salivating like a Klegg just thinking about it.** EDIT - 5th April 2021 **
Just watched Dredd again, this time without the benefit of 3D, and found it less impressive than I remembered. I was struck more than before by how poorly Mega City One is presented, with vehicles that look like they're from now instead the end of the 21st century. Little effort was spent in making the environment appear futuristic - things like computer keyboards and electric fans are still as they are today. Budget was clearly an issue, and it shows.Also, the whole 'Wait' conversation doesn't work for me. The bad judge would've plugged Dredd in the head instead of allowing him to buy time.I still love Urban's portrayal, and the violence is cool, but I really hope that if there is a next time, they make the film look more like the comics.Old rating: 8/10
New rating: 6.5/10, rounded up to 7. It's still good, just not great.",Dredd
12,paul_haakonsen,Action from start till end...,7,13 January 2013,"I remember reading some of the comic books while I was a young kid, and then the Stallone movie came along, which really wasn't all that great. Then this 2012 ""Dredd"" movie came along and really gave a much needed boost of adrenaline to the ""Dredd"" universe, movie-wise that is.The story in ""Dredd"" is very simple and anyone with even half a mind should be able to keep up with it. Two judges are dispatched to a less than savory complex to investigate some murders. But they are in for something far bigger. As the building becomes sealed off and under lockdown, the two judges find themselves facing a whole gang of hardened criminals ruled by the drug manufacturing Ma Ma.""Dredd"" is basically an action movie spiced up with a hint of storyline to justify all the violence and action. And I must say that the action scenes were really nicely executed and filmed. The way you saw bullets tear through people and the blood splattering was just awesome. Though this might not be suitable for just anyone.The characters in the movie were great, lots of nice details and personal touches. Especially the Dredd character, he was really nicely portrayed, with his permanently dour face and wearing the helmet throughout the entire movie. And as for the gang members, well they were rugged, harsh and really did look like drug-addicted gang members. The universe there was nicely constructed and you really do buy into the atmosphere.As for the costumes, well they nailed it quite nicely. The judges uniforms were great, and not using bright colors which would make them seem too much like cartoon characters.""Dredd"" is a great interpretation of the Dredd comic book universe, and director Pete Travis has done a great movie working on this movie. ""Dredd"" is a movie well worth watching for any fans of pure action movies and bleak futuristic movies.",Dredd
13,BandSAboutMovies,HE IS THE LAW!,8,1 June 2021,"12-year-old me loved Judge Dredd perhaps more than I can convey in words. So you can imagine my excitement when they decided to make a Hollywood blockbuster out of it. What was once a property that existed only in 2000 AD and in songs by Anthrax suddenly had Mattel action figures and a pinball machine in arcades. And then, well, Judge Dredd came out and the only people who cared about it any longer were the ones like me that know what the Cursed Earth is (not to mention stuff like the ABC Warriors and Strontium Dog; I'm not bragging, trust me).Dredd is everything that movie should have been.Directed by Pete Travers (Vantage Point) and starring Karl Urban as a Dredd who never takes his helmet off or shows mercy - so he's pretty much the Judge Dredd we know and love - the film takes place in Mega City One, which is pretty much the East Coast of what's left of the United States. There, 800 million residents commit 17,000 crimes every single day and only the Judges can keep law and order.Dredd and new recruit Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) have come to the Peach Trees block, which is run by drug dealer Madeline ""Ma-Ma"" Madrigal (Lena Headey), the supplier of Slo-Mo, a drug that makes time move at a crawl for its users. She has rogue Judges on her payroll and an entire building in her employ, but Dredd is relentless in his pursuit of justice.Written by Alex Garland (The Beach, the screenplays for 28 Days Later and Sunshine), this is a film that doesn't just understand its subject matter, but completely gets how Dredd is less always meaning more. Dredd co-creator John Wagner also wrote a lot of the dialogue, so that definitely made this movie better.While this has become a cult classic, it deserved so much better. Urban told Den of Geek that the issue was ""zero audience awareness. Nobody knew the movie was being released. Dredd represents a failure in marketing, not filmmaking.""So many of us hold out hope that a sequel or series will happen one day. Watch it and you'll be one of us.",Dredd
14,hitchcockthelegend,Incendiary!,8,27 December 2018,"Dredd is directed by Pete Travis and written by Alex Garland. It stars Karl Urban, Olivia Thirlby, Lena Headey and Wood Harris. Music is by Paul Leonard-Morgan and cinematography by Anthony Dod Mantle.Review for 2D Version Only.Sylvester Stallone'S 1995 attempt at bringing Judge Dredd to the big screen was met with a critical mauling, both professionally and by serious fans of the 2000AD comic books from whence the character came. On its own terms it's a fun popcorn piece, but one that totally missed the fascist grime of the source. Here however, under the guidance of Travis and Garland, Dredd gets the picture the fans and the character deserves.Plot is simple, we are in a dystopian future in a place known as Mega-City One. The only law and order are the Judges who are able to act as judge, jury and executioner. One such feared judge is Judge Dredd (Urban) and when he and his partner in training, Anderson (Thirlby), answer a call to a triple homicide at the multi storey slum tenement known as Peach Trees, they are locked in by crime boss Ma-Ma (Headey) and forced to defend themselves against practically everyone who resides there.This is stripped down to the essence of what makes Judge Dredd such a beloved character in comic book lore. There's no need for backstories, love interests or comedy side-kicks, this is bad ass characters from either side of the law going at it full throttle. The action is unrelenting and explosive in its construction, bloody and brutal into the bargain as well.Dredd the character is rightly kept to a basic level, he's a hard dude in a suit and a helmet, with an arsenal of weapons upon his person and he delivers short sharp shock pieces of dialogue with gruff assertiveness. Anderson is a mutant of sorts, she can read minds, which superbly adds spice to this fight for survival narrative. Ma-Ma is a damaged villain, disgustingly menacing without histrionics, it's her calmness that's so terrifying.At the core of the criminal activities fronted by Ma-Ma is a new drug called Slo-Mo, a drug that reduces the brain's perception to 1% of speed. This allows the makers to bring some dazzling effects into play whilst setting up some blood letting scenarios. The production design is top draw, where Mega-City One has a perfect totalitarianism sheen to it, which in turn is boosted by Dod Mantle's excellent colour lenses.With Urban perfectly cast and his two lady co-stars also firing, Dredd is a thrilling action sci-fi movie. It doesn't push new boundaries and raise the bar per se, but it keeps the fires well and truly burning in the genre whilst simultaneously appeasing the fans wholesale. 8/10",Dredd
15,Theo Robertson,Enjoyably Mean,7,1 April 2015,"I was never really a fan of Judge Dredd . My own favourite strip from 2000 AD was Invasion which told of a Communist conquest Britain by the Volgan Republic . That said I do realise Dredd is one of the legends of British comic strips due to the Judge often dishing out poetic justice to baddies and as a film fan I can also tell you the Stallone version of the mid 1990s was rather disappointing not least because it doesn't really keep to the spirit of the source material What surprised me very much about this version is the producers have resisted the obvious temptation of maximising profits by playing it safe and going for a PG-13 cert . This doesn't happen and we've got a film featuring extreme violence , comic book violence mind you but it's still a little bit nasty and mean . The storyline itself is no great shakes , a reworking of DIE HARD but a simple premise often makes for good cinema and the production know that if you're going to have a film where the title character isn't allowed to take off his helmet under any circumstances then it's a good idea not to spend money on casting a big name star in the role .. Watch out for that poetic justice Dredd dishes out . Conscious that some people might be reminded of the original ROBOCOP the dialogue does give the occasional wink to the audience "" Twenty seconds to comply"" Where DREDD is much less successful is the visuals . As has often been said on this page the expressionistic scenes featuring people under the influence of the slo-mo drug very quickly becomes over used . I haven't double checked but I take it this was filmed in 3-D ? I don't like 3-D . Never have and never will because the camera is always locked on at unnatural angles where objects like bullets and splatters of blood fly out of the screen and I guess that's the reason there's so much slow motion and takes advantage of the 3-D The 3-D is something of a drawback because I found myself enjoying the film much more than I expected due to its mean spirited tone and tongue in cheek violence . It's obviously not an Oscar contender but as a slightly dark action blockbuster that doesn't itself too seriously it is a good film",Dredd
16,Hey_Sweden,Top notch modern action film.,8,5 April 2013,"""Dredd"" is a respectful adaptation of the long running cult comic book created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra, made with nothing but love by a crew including screenwriter / fan Alex Garland (""28 Days Later"") and director Pete Travis (""Vantage Point""). Filmed on a low budget in Cape Town, South Africa, it's just futuristic enough, satirical enough, violent enough, and colourful enough to rate as solid escapism.It's stylish every step of the way, with its creation of a metropolis of the future impressive. Its story is lean and mean and it doesn't fool around; it definitely gives the audience what they want and then some. It's got a perfectly bad ass hero who, while he may come up lacking in the personality department, is absolutely dependable and will do ANYTHING necessary to see that justice is done.Karl Urban is just right as Judge Dredd, one of a group of lawmen in the future who have the ability to serve as judge, jury, and executioner when it comes to dealing with various criminal scum. He's requested to break in a new partner, Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), who's not really cut out to be a judge but is encouraged just the same because of her psychic abilities. The two are assigned to escort a criminal witness back to the station and find that leaving an enormous tower block with their charge will present to them numerous challenges, as they are threatened by the minions of a powerful drug lord named Ma-Ma (Lena Headey).The visuals are stunning and the special effects amazing; the action is fast, furious, and noticeably gory. The pacing never falters and Travis is able to keep us watching and waiting for the next big set piece. Dredd himself may be monotonous as a hero, but that's where Anderson comes in as she adds the humanity to the proceedings; Thirlby is fine in the role. Headey is good, going for nuance in her performance rather than making Ma-Ma your typical foaming-at-the-mouth omnipotent villain.This film comes highly recommended, and is done in the best tradition of the modern action film. It's got humour (derived from the environments in which Dredd and others find themselves), suspense, and grit, and always has another explosion up its sleeve. It gets down to business extremely quickly and rarely lets up until its ultimate confrontation. It would have been nice to have seen some of the crazier characters from the comics, so it's much too bad that it looks like there won't be any sequels.Eight out of 10.",Dredd

18,poolandrews,"Watchable but nothing special, I was a bit disappointed really.",7,21 December 2012,"Dredd 3D is set in the future where America has become a irradiated wasteland, stretching from Boston to Washington one city surrounded by a huge wall known as Mega City One has a population of 800 million people living in fear of the lawless crime & chaos where 17,000 serious crimes are reported every day. To try & combat the crime the Hall of Justice has been created, street Judges are given powers to act as judge, jury & if need be instant executioner. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is just about the toughest Judge out there, with no feeling for anything other than the law he is totally dedicated & fearless. A huge structure known as Peach Trees that houses 75,000 people is a breeding ground for gangs & criminals including the sadistic drug lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) who has developed a new addictive drug called 'Slo-mo', after she skins & kills three rival dealers Judge Dredd & rookie Judge Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) decide to investigate & arrest gang member Kay (Wood Harris) who know's too much so Ma-Ma seals the entire block in order to hunt down & kill the two Judges...This American, English & Indian co-production was directed by Pete Travis & has nothing to do with the Sylvester Stallone starring Judge Dredd (1995) which most people seem to hate but I actually rather enjoyed although I was certainly not against a new harder, more violent & serious take on the character so I was looking forward to Dredd 3D & after having watched it I can only feel somewhat disappointed by a rather average sci-fi action film that offers very little besides lots of shooting. The character of Dredd is wasted, any tough cop character could have replaced Dredd & it wouldn't have made much difference. The script is largely set inside Peach Trees apartment block & the Mega City One is forgotten about, the problems of a future society are forgotten about & the routine script becomes a standard cops against criminals action thriller. The drug aspect of the script also feels clichéd, Ma-Ma as the main villain is very poor & this really needed a good villain against Dredd although I did like rookie Anderson as a character as she adds some humanity to Dredd's intenseness. At just over 90 minutes Dredd 3D has a good pace, the story is basic but alright for what it is although the action is patchy & a bit unimaginative. The issues surrounding the powers that ordinary cops should have are ignored, issues about drug taking are never raised & all the social commentary that could have been included to make a more worthwhile & thought provoking film has been completely bypassed.It's been noted just how similar the basic story of Dredd 3D is to that of The Raid (2011) although apparently both films went into production at the same time & Dredd 3D supposedly finished filming first. Another film Dredd 3D reminded me of was the original Die Hard (1989) set inside that huge building with a maverick cop on his own having to take out the bad guy's against the odds. The action is alright but there's nothing amazing here, there's plenty of shooting, a few fights & actually not much else. There's a fair bit of violence here, there's plenty of blood as well with bullets flying through people's faces, blowing heads off & hands being blown off. The production design is good, the futuristic city is part real recognisable world with added CGI computer attachments to enhance the landscape & turn it into a plausible vision of the future. Unlike in the Stallone film Dredd never removes his helmet during this, am I really the only one who thinks it looks a bit plastic & silly like a child's toy?With a supposed budget of about $50,000,000 this didn't have a huge budget but I would hardly call it low budget like some are saying. The production design & special effects work is certainly more low key, much more restrained & less futuristic than in the Stallone film, just compare the motorbikes Dredd rides in the two films to see what I mean. Shot in Cape Town & Johannesburg in South Africa. This did nothing at the box-office & barely made th top 10 when released in the US, so with Stallone's film & now this both bombing I think this may be the last we see of Dredd on the big screen. The acting is alright, Karl Urban as Dredd has to act with his mouth as the rest of his face is covered up for the entire film, I also thought Olivia Thirlby was really good but I thought Lena Headey was terrible as the villain & simply wasn't imposing or threatening.Dredd 3D is a decent enough sci-fi action thriller that I thought could have been better, it felt rather routine & I thought the Dredd character & universe was wasted. I don't know, it just felt like this Jugde Dredd character was simply placed into a slightly above average action film. I didn't hate it but I didn't love it either, I actually probably like the Stallone one better.",Dredd
19,CinemaSerf,Decent comic book adventure with no airs or graces....,7,5 January 2021,"I used to read the comics when I was young, and they were simple, straightforward shoot 'em ups with ""Dredd"" the epitome of tough, no-nonsense law enforcement in a futuristic environment where crime, violence, poverty and unemployment were pretty normal for many people. This time, Karl Urban takes the title role as the policeman/judge/jury type, and he and his rookie ""Anderson"" (Olivia Thirlby) investigate a few dead bodies in the lobby of an hundred-odd storey building controlled by the drug dealing matriarch ""Ma-Ma"" (Lena Headey) and her menacing henchmen. To begin with, they must find the killer and get out alive - but when some of his own kind arrive and turn against him - and his partner is captured - he sets out to settle this once and for all. Yep, the dialogue is shocking; the acting only little better (Headey is about as menacing as yesterday's creme brûlée) but that's not the point. It's meant to be a brutal action adventure - loads of pyrotechnics, attitude, gun-battles (with some great weapons, btw) that is just aimless fun. That's what is says on the tin, and that's what is does. Never any doubt about the ending, but the route is what it's all about - and for me, anyway, it's just 90 minutes of mindless escapism with a bit of mind-reading thrown in for good measure. Not everything can be Jane Austen - aim low and you ought not to be too disappointed.",Dredd
20,zardoz-13,Dredd-FULL!,1,22 September 2012,"""Vantage Point"" director Pete Travis and ""28 Days Later"" scenarist Alex Garland have conspired to make a hopelessly abysmal reboot of the British ""2000 AD"" comic strip. New Zealand actor Karl Urban steps into the boots that Sylvester Stallone wore in director Danny Cannon's ""Judge Dredd"" that bombed at the box office in 1995. Despite its estimated $50 million production cost, ""Dredd 3-D"" looks like a low-budget, made-for-television movie. Although it takes place in a distant, post-apocalyptic America of the future, this science fiction saga delivers little high octane action and no narrative revelations. Unlike the first ""Judge Dredd"" epic with its flying cars and motorcycles, ""Dredd 3-D"" shuns ""Blade Runner"" airborne automobiles and hovering motorcycles. This shallow, straightforward British/South African co-production confines itself strictly to only a few settings. Most of the low octane action occurs in an enormous skyscraper complex that houses about 60-thousand citizens. Whereas the original ""Judge Dredd"" concerned our hero's efforts to exonerate himself after he was framed for the murder of a journalist on the basis of DNA evidence, the new ""Dredd"" amounts to a pedestrian police procedural set in a sprawling city state. Karl Urban channels ""Dirty Harry"" with his raspy, low-key, monosyllabic dialogue delivery. Indeed, he never removes his helmet during this 95-minute, R-rated outing. Essentially, Urban looks like Beetle Bailey because only his mouth and chin are visible. Granted, this is the way Judge Dredd appears in the comic strip, but ""Dredd 3-D"" is a feature film, not a one-dimensional comic strip.""Dredd 3-D"" unfolds in a post-nuked America. Basically, only one city exists, and it is Mega City, with some 800-thousand residents. Mega City occupies the east coast of the United States, roughly encompassing Boston and Washington, D.C., while everything else that lies beyond its wall consists of scorched wasteland. The Stallone ""Judge Dredd"" occurred in part outside the walls of Mega City,"" while ""Dredd 3-D"" takes place wholly within Mega City. Crime has reached epidemic proportions, with twelve serious crimes occurring every minute, and 17-thousand happening each day. Street judges are so overwhelmed that at best they can only intervene in six percent of all crime. When ""Dredd 3-D"" opens, our helmet-clad hero is crouched over a motorcycle racing after three thugs as they swerve through traffic while abusing a new drug called 'Slo Mo.' Judge Dredd (Karl Urban of ""Star Trek"") has no problem subjugating these three desperadoes. At the Hall of Justice, he learns that he has acquired a new partner, an aptly named Cassandra Johnson (Olivia Thirlby of ""No Strings Attached""), who possesses psychic powers. Earlier, Cassandra failed an aptitude test that would have qualified her to serve as a judge. Street judges exercise the legal authority to sentence criminals on the spot and even execute them if their conduct is depraved enough. The Chief Judge wants to give Cassandra another chance so he assigns her to Judge Dredd so Dredd can reassess her suitability as a judge. ""Dredd 3-D"" is reminiscent of the Dirty Harry police thriller ""The Enforcer"" where Harry wound up with a rookie female detective. Anyhow, these two are dispatched to Peach Trees, a ghetto-like high rise where a major criminal, Madeline Madrigal (Leana Headey of HBO's ""Game of Thrones""), dominates the illegal drug trade. She has three men injected with Slo Mo, skinned alive, and hurled to their deaths from the top of the tower. Dredd and Cassandra are dispatched to investigate. No sooner have they set foot on the premises and arrested one suspect than they find themselves trapped in the tower. The ruthless criminals have shut Peach Trees down and sealed it off completely so nobody else can enter or exit it. What follows is a blood bath with a high body count that our indestructible heroes survive with a close shave or two.""Dredd 3-D"" is as one-dimensional as a cardboard punch-out book. The characters are sketchy, and the actors bring little humanity to them. Whereas ""Judge Dredd"" was a sardonic exercise in mock-heroic action, ""Dredd 3-D"" is as humorless as it is moribund. Leana Headey is looks like a Cosmo model with scars on her right cheek. Actually, all the villains look pretty cool, but they are incredibly incompetent buffoons. At one point, they devastate an entire floor trying to perforate our heroes with three, six-barreled Gatling gun style, General Electric M134 mini-Vulcan machine guns. These weapons can pour out between 2000 and 6000 rounds of 7.62 mm shells a minute. Villains like these dastards constitute little challenge for our heroes. If this weren't lame enough, even Cassandra with her psychic powers cannot divine the thoughts of a suspect that Dredd and she have arrested and who is standing behind her. This villain is able to free himself from his restraints and abduct her! Nothing about this Judge Dredd movie is innovative. A showdown like this between our heroes and an army of hoodlums was depicted with greater savagery in ""Punisher: War Zone"" (2008) and the recent Indonesian movie ""The Raid—Redemption."" As for the 3-D effects, they add nothing to this lackluster exercise in déjà-vu. Originally, 3-D movies were designed to make the audience duck when a flying projectile winged its way toward them. 3-D movies like ""Dredd 3-D"" resemble the images that were once available on those vintage Viewmaster Viewers where you loaded a picture disc into it. Not surprisingly, ""Dredd 3-D"" lives up to its title.",Dredd
21,grantss,Dull and irritating,4,16 December 2015,"Dull and irritating.Not really a remake of the 1995 ""Judge Dredd"", though not sure why it was made anyway. Very one-dimensional, clichéd and predictable plot. Direction bordered on the irritating. The slo-mo shots were appropriate, initially, but then director Pete Travis got slo-mo happy and overused them. Irritation ensues.Performances are so-so. Karl Urban seems to be trying to channel Clint Eastwood / Dirty Harry, and it just seems very unoriginal. Olivia Thirlby is OK in her role. Lena Headey, as the villain, is probably the best of the lot.",Dredd
22,Boba_Fett1138,Simple but great quality entertainment.,8,29 September 2012,"Of course this is not being a perfect movie with an airtight story in it but it absolutely does a great job at providing some great quality entertainment, making ""Dredd 3D"" a perfectly enjoyable genre flick!It was actually quite surprising to find out how simple and straightforward this movie was being. It pretty much jumps right into the action and doesn't ever really take the time to setup its world and characters. It's really a movie without any distractions and moves right toward its goal, without making things ever deep or complicated. It might sound as a complain but it really isn't. After all, as the movie progresses we do learn about its characters and get to understand the futuristic world it is taking place in. So it really doesn't ever feel like the movie is wasting time with anything and every time you think the movie is starting to get deeper, more serious or complicated, it goes right back to its action.And since this movie is taking place in a futuristic world, it has plenty of original elements in it. This also really goes for its action. It allows itself to become really creative with its weaponry and action, which means that the movie often manages to surprise you with stuff and the movie never starts to repeat itself, even though its mostly taking place at one location, with also just an handful of different characters involved.It's foremost the action that makes this movie a worthwhile experience and its handled and shot very well by both its cast and crew. The movie has a good look to it and doesn't ever try to blow you away with one particular special effect shot or action sequences but rather tries to impress you with its whole end product.It of course is also being its main character that lets the movie work out. He's a tough and mysterious person, who walks the fine line of what's considered to be good and bad. Sure, Karl Urban does a good job playing the character but in all honestly, it really didn't mattered who would had played him. After all, you most certainly won't be able to recognize Urban in this movie, mostly due to the reason that he never takes of his helmet, which is actually being a good and effective thing for the movie and its main character in general. Of course when you start nitpicking you could find plenty of flaws to this movie and story but some movies are just made to simply enjoy, without letting you think too much or too long about anything that's happening in it. It might be try that this at the same time makes ""Dredd 3D"" a somewhat forgettable movie but when you watch you'll simply have a great time, regardless of that!8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Dredd
23,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,More like what you'd want,8,30 September 2012,"Set in a dystopian future, regular police is not enough to keep the peace in a mostly charred Earth with huge cities that hold too many people. The justice system is sped up with the so-called Judges also serving as one-person jury and executioner. One of the best is Dredd(portrayed by Urban's chin and his impersonation of Clint Eastwood's voice... the cadence and intonation, that is; and it's spot-on, helmet stays on, he barely changes, he is the face of the law, he is a symbol not a man), and he has to spend the day evaluating the rookie Anderson(Thirlby, whose sweet, more hopeful approach to the job brings the only humanity to this(and it aids them in several situations where the veteran didn't have a good solution), which is great... without her, this would have been intolerable; she matures some over the course of it, and kicks plenty of ass and asserts herself as an authority figure), who has psychic powers... something I feared would be horrible, and I was positively surprised; it's funny, not goofy, useful, and fits into the world they create here, that of gritty, nasty, smothering brutality(at times it's gore and violence as art, as well as gratuitous and glorified(there are bits where this forgets that we're not supposed to be interested in having a police state... it does bring up themes about such... more satire would be fantastic, however)) and tragic fates(plenty of people in this aren't perps, they're human beings, families of criminals, and the like) in the slum(you don't want to live in this place, no matter what), and it would be excessive if it was more than 90 minutes long(this is well balanced, is what I'm getting at). With that, it keeps to a solid(high without overpowering you) pace(with swift, hard-hitting, realistic action, where people run out of bullets and have to take cover to not be hit... there's only one section that has a Hollywood stunt), with the plot well out of the way(there's not a lot of it) and a good set-up: they're trapped in a skyscraper with people living on every floor(a block in one building), with the gang housed there all after them, and them fighting to just survive. The leader of this is Ma-Ma(Headey, always a strong female... and in this, you're terrified of her), who is smart and tactical in the way she deals with these two targets... every situation she encounters, she has prepared for, and it makes it all the more satisfying. She's involved with a drug that is both called, and has the effect of, Slo-Mo... you might think there's too much of that, it's all used well, clearly being the one escape(things look beautiful on it) from the awful situation(you understand that, without it ever being said), and there's a narcotics raid early on, where the nastiness forces itself upon those high off it. This is as cheesy as the Sly take on it(with one-liners(that break the otherwise well-written, natural dialog... except for brief narration, this doesn't ""explain""(save for a briefing scene with exposition), it shows a universe and you deduce how things work and go together) and machoism, that once or twice gets dumb), though definitely the better picture. While you don't need to be a fan, if you are, you'll love it. The look of this is incredible and consistent, and the heavy use of practical FX is much appreciated. 3D is similar to that of Avatar, making things feel closer to you, not gimmicky(if anything is thrown at the viewer, it will be blood pouring out over you). In addition to what I've already mentioned, there is a lot of strong language and some sexuality(uncomfortable, at times rape) in this. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the genre, provided they're not easily offended. 8/10",Dredd
24,view_and_review,Dredd a lot better than Judge Dredd,8,27 January 2014,"Dredd outdid it's predecessor in every facet. That's not saying a lot because it's not like Judge Dredd was a timeless classic. Even still, Dredd was better cinematically, story-wise and even the acting (sorry Sly).Dredd employed some nice special effects that fit the scene as opposed to being thrown in there just because. In this age of digital animation some movies tend to abuse it. Dredd used the effects very creatively and aptly. I even liked the scenery better in this rendition of the comic hero. It was more dark and gritty which was accentuated by the R rating.I particularly liked the story. This story shows that drugs are a problem even in the future. And even though it was the future and some things had changed, still a lot stayed the same... Crime, gangs, drugs and poverty. The story was spun well with a seamless transition into the high drama. It wasn't contrived or manufactured just for the sake of making a battle. Even the ending was very fitting.In a world where bad remakes are the norm, this was a gem. I only worry now about this recent remake of something that is a classic: Robocop.",Dredd
25,neil-476,Completely hollow,7,11 September 2012,"Judge Dredd is carrying out an assessment on borderline rookie (and psychic) cop Cassandra Anderson. On investigating a crime in the Peachtrees megablock they stumble across someone who could inform them about the production of the drug Slo-mo within Peachtrees, so crime boss Ma-Ma shuts down the block and commissions the killing of the two Judges.This is a straightforward action thriller with a mildly sci-fi setting, and a plot which is little more than a video game shoot-'em-up series of impersonal targets trying to shoot you while you blow them away first. This incarnation of Megacity one is much more recognisably derived from the present day, and the effects and look aren't bad. There is no characterisation of any consequence - Karl Urban delivers Dredd's one-note character well, and Olivia Thirlby makes valiant attempts with Anderson but isn't given a great deal to work with. Even Lena Headey's Ma-Ma doesn't have much beyond disfiguring scars and snarling. There is a lot of action, it's well delivered, quite entertaining and extremely bloody in the vein of Simon Bisley's most excessive work. There is moderate bad language. What there isn't is much by way of emotional engagement - it's all very exciting, but you don't really care: why should you? So how does it compare with the Stallone Dredd, widely regarded as a failure? Well, it has clearly made a decision to root Dredd's world in the real world: Stallone's Dredd took pains to emulate the comic, this movie goes the Nolan Batman route of making things gritty and practical. And, as noted elsewhere, Urban eschews face time in favour of keeping the helmet on throughout. This film is perhaps more faithful to the mood of the comic, but it forgets to be fun. It is deadly earnest and, apart from the visual aspect, has little of any substance to hold the interest. It wasn't until afterwards that I realised how disappointed I was that it was, ultimately, so empty.It was pleasing to see Judge Anderson, PSI Division, make her screen debut.The 3D is almost unnoticeable through most of the movie.",Dredd
26,Uriah43,"Judge, Jury and Executioner",7,6 September 2018,"Set in a dystopian future, the law-enforcement apparatus has broken down across the country to the point that ""Judges"" patrol the streets of certain major cities and administer whatever punishment they are allowed to deliver based on a loosely set code of laws. In this film one particular man known as ""Judge Dredd"" (Karl Urban) is given the task of qualifying a new recruit named ""Cassandra Anderson"" (Olivia Thirlby) and the first patrol selected for her concerns a gruesome murder in a public housing high-rise known as Peach Trees. What they don't realize is that this specific building doubles as the headquarters and drug manufacturing center for an extremely vicious drug lord by the name of ""Ma-Ma"" (Lena Headey) who has no tolerance for any organization-legal or otherwise-that might interfere with her operation. And once these two Judges enter her building they become targets for her gang. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a very good science fiction action film which captured the essence of the ""Judge Dredd"" comic book in an excellent manner. Although the action was somewhat fast-paced, the director (Pete Travis) had the expertise to include some decent character development which served to benefit the overall plot to a high degree.

Years later: With having kept a casual interest in 2000AD in the ensuring years,and also having missed Dredd make his movie debut,I decided to make up for lost time by seeing the law get enforced on the big screen.The plot:The future:With being told to put psychic rookie Judge/cop Cassandra Anderson ""through the ropes"",Judge Dredd takes Anderson to investigate a triple murder that has taken place at a drugs and gangs run section of Mega City One called Peach Trees.Arriving to the main block of flats at Peach Trees,Anderson and Dredd find out that each of the three men had recently taken a new street drug called ""Slo-Mo"",that causes the user 's normal perception of speed to slow down to 1%.Bustin doors down,they soon find the dealers who sold the guys the drugs.Just before Dredd calls in to order that all of the criminals be put into ""cryo- jail"",Anderson uses her psychic skills on one of the dealers to discover that the main drug production line of ""Slo-Mo"" is based right at very top of the flats.Initially planning to bust the drug production line with a short,sharp,shock,Dredd and Anderson soon discover that the ""Slo-Mo's"" drug queenpin Madeline Madrigal aka Ma-Ma is going to use her iron fist control on the Peach Trees block of flats,to make sure,that this time,she is judge,jury and executioner.View on the film:Being deeply disappointed with the use of 3D in a number of movies,I was please to witness the technology get a knock out punch to the head!.Opaning with the title exploding on the screen,director Pete Travis and Danny Boyle/Lars Von Trier main cinematography Anthony Dod Mantle deliver truly eye-popping 3D,as blood,smoke,bullets and glass ""jump out"" of the screen to pull the audience deep into the action.Along with the 3D,Travis also shows a real eye for the many tremendous action scenes,by giving the Peach Trees, (named after a building in Shrewsbury UK!) a real seedy atmosphere,whilst also staying away from trigger-happy jump cuttings,to instead allow the viewer to get a real feel of the action taking place.Pulled right from a 40's hard-nosed Gangster movie by Alex Garland's rough'n' ready screenplay,Karl Urban shows the Dredd helmet to be a perfect fit,thanks to being able to deliver the film's adrenalin-rushing,ultra-violence action scenes with a real relish,whilst also keeping the character away from being one dimensional,by cleverly having moments which allow his personality to come through,such as walking to the pounding Industral score by Paul Leonard-Morgan,to delivering one liners that will put a grin on any Action movie fans face, (""Its judgement time"") as they get the chance to witness Judge Dredd deliver some bone crunching hard justice.",Dredd

Urban is fantastic as the Judge, and I had plenty of doubts about him. But seeing him on the bike, and delivering some wonderful lines, faith was restored.The story, while not the most original, is still good, and the used of the slow motion and the 3-D are used to good effect.The is graphic with its depiction of violence, but this is how Dredd is in the comics, so I think some critics (chris tookey of the Daily Mail, I'm talking to you) may have missed the films point.The film never tries to be too funny or comic book-ish, and the character of Ma-Ma is just cool and collected throughout the film, making her a villain to be feared.All in all it's a wonderful Independent movie, with lots of references to Die Hard, Blade Runner, and of course The Raid.Well worth a trip to the movies.",Dredd
30,Aaron1375,Makes one forget the 1995 version rather quickly,9,8 February 2013,"This film came to the theater in September 2012 and pretty much did nothing...grossing only 13 million at the box office. However, I saw a trailer at Expendables 2 and it looked good, just never really got around to seeing it. On DVD, this film apparently found new life as a whole bunch of people I know said this film was very cool and good. I bought it, and I was not disappointed. This was a dark and gritty film with great action and some brutal violence. It is how I picture the world of Dredd and while it had limited locations and such, it made up for it by being extremely fast paced...even with the Slo Mo drug! The story has a new drug on the streets. Dredd and a new rookie he is accessing happen to stumble upon the prime distributor of this drug in a giant housing complex. This person, known as Ma Ma is a crazed psycho with a penchant for violence to the insane degree. She takes control of the building and orders the elimination of the two judges mainly because they have taken one of her people prisoner and if they interrogate him, he will possibly reveal to them that Ma Ma is the main distributor of the drug Slo Mo. Unfortunately, one of the judges is Dredd, a judge who does not rattle easily and can handle himself rather well in a situation such as this. In fact, one gets the feeling he has been through this before. The rookie with him is a mutant and she has psychic powers that will assist both her and Dredd in making it to the top floor for the final confrontation with Ma Ma and her gang.There are a myriad of reasons this film failed at the box office...for one it got a September release, usually reserved for films more geared towards the female movie fan and this film is not a female film. Football season has just begun, baseball is concluding...just not a good time to release a film like this and if it is, most think that the studio put it there because they know it sucks. Then there is the been there done that factor as it is a reboot, and reboots can be successful, but they tend to not perform as well as the original. Then there is the fact the original was not exactly a beloved film. It had a totally different feel than this film as it almost had a Flash Gordon look to it while this one feels more like a dim and dark future society. Still, this one was able to find new life on DVD, and who knows perhaps a sequel could still be made.So this film was a definite upgrade to the 1995 film. I thought Karl Urban's portrayal of Dredd was much more in lines with the character than Stallone's. I also liked the fact that you never saw Dredd without his helmet on in this film. Too often in comic book films the filmmakers want to take off the heroes mask. To the point that they expose the hero to countless people and yet their identity is still somehow kept secret. Here the hero is not even trying to conceal his identity and they keep his 'mask' as it were on. The girl playing the psychic rookie is really cute and does her role well. Ma Ma is also a very good villain, I love how it ends for her! A very good film and it trumps the 1995 film in almost every way!",Dredd
31,zetes,"Okay, but it has the misfortune of following the similar and much better The Raid: Redemption",6,25 December 2012,"Not that bad, ultra-violent action flick. It has two huge strikes against it, though: first, the character of Judge Dredd never takes off his mask. This is straight from the comic books, and I'm aware that the original Judge Dredd, played by Sly Stallone, was heavily criticized because he immediately took off his iconic helmet. The thing is, with his helmet always on, he has zero personality. I had no idea who played him (turns out it's Karl Urban), and, quite frankly, I couldn't care less about the character. Second, and perhaps more damning: the film was totally beaten to the punch by The Raid: Redemption. Like that one, Dredd's plot consists of the protagonist and his rookie partner (a gorgeous Olivia Thirlby - at least the filmmakers weren't so stupid as to ever even once obscuring her lovely face with a helmet) getting locked up in a gang-run skyscraper. The drug-lord ruler of the skyscraper (Lena Heady) orders all her minions to kill the judges, and the two of them have to fight their way up the tower to get Heady. I think this might have one down as a bit of a cult classic if it weren't for the fact that The Raid was both first and much better.",Dredd
32,trashgang,a few mistakes by the marketing boys but what a great flick this is,9,17 January 2013,"Dredd, what can be said about this failure. A lot, first of all it is compared with Sylvester Stallone's Judge Dredd (1995). For so many it was a very good flick but for the die-hard fans of Dredd it was a big failure. So we do have a problem here. The 1995 edition failed and this one failed theatrical. But why? The marketing campaign was rather zero. Over here you only saw the posters at the cinemas itself. No promo whatsoever. On the other hand it was shot in 3D, love or hate it but some film fans doesn't enter into the 3D adventure. Further, based on a comic it is clearly for youth but being rated R youth couldn't enter. In Europe it did had the same problems. The damage was done and it was a big flop. No expectations at all I watched it, sadly not in 3D.From the first ten minutes I immediately saw that this was going to be my thing. Karl Urban could be compared with Sylvester but don't do that, okay, his mouth is a look-a-like but watch the comics, He do has that kind of grimace on his face. And just like Christopher Nolan's Batman he also speaks in a low timbre. But I also liked the other main roles, Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) and Ma-Ma (Lena Headey). But not only that. Quickly you will see why it got a R. Buckets of blood and bullet-shredded flesh ensue. Once we do to know Ma-Ma the brutality comes in Dredd. She do looks sexy but she's lethal and it shows. She's the big boss in Mega City One's Peachtrees and is responsible for the drug slo-mo. And it's just there when the slo-mo works that this flick becomes marvelous. It's captured with digital cameras at 3000 frames per second. In 3D. When bullets are hitting bodies it's a delight to see in slo-mo and be sure in 3D. The blood flies around and there are even some gore involved. When 3 guys are falling from top of a building to the ground we do see smashed faces and skulls, all gore included. And there's a lot of reds stuff here. made me think of the eighties Sci-Fi flicks. And just listen to the score, a return to the eighties and early nineties.Overlooked by many but what a gem this is. Hero against villain. Gore and blood, a lot of. And an excellent performance by Karl Urban. A perfect example what promotion could do to a film. I watched it with fear of being a real flop but if I judge correctly this is the perfect Dredd.Gore 3/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 4/5 comedy 0/5",Dredd
33,deloudelouvain,Predictable,6,16 March 2017,"If you're a big fan of the comic than you will probably love this movie. I thought the movie was okay to watch once, nothing more. Not that it isn't any good or so but it's just that with superheroes you always know how it's going to end. So the element of surprise is never there with movies like this one. The hero always win and that will never change. But if you are over that and you just want to watch a sci-fi action movie than you're at the right place with Dredd. You won't see much of the actor's face though. The only facial expression you see from him is like he just smelled a bad fart. That's about it. Judge Dredd is not a very joyful character, his mission is arrest or kill the bandits. All in all the filming is good, the actors are okay, but the story is just predictable.",Dredd
34,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Dredd,10,22 September 2012,"Fans can take heart that Alex Garland's screenplay, together with Pete Travis' direction, makes this a worthy Dredd film. There's no need to dwell in unnecessary back stories, or go beyond the fleeting introduction to the state of the World in this universe, the rule of the Judges, and the concepts in Mega-City One. It dives straight into the thick of the action, fast forwarding to the main plot of having Dredd (Karl Urban) assigned to assess rookie Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), who is on the fail end of borderline to become a Judge, by throwing her into the deep end of the pool and seeing if she would sink or swim, with a chance given because she's a powerful psychic who can hone her abilities, which naturally come advantageous in a fire fight. Their enemy is Ma Ma (Lena Headey), a prostitute turned drug dealer, buckled down in the Peach Trees Block of 200 floors filled with thugs at every level who do her bidding, whose narcotic Slo-Mo allows a high that's pretty much an opportunity of the filmmakers to experiment with psychedelic slow motion effects that are primed to exploit the 3D version. Drugs, and three skinned, drug pumped bodies thrown over a parapet, goes onto Dredd and Anderson's radar, and with their entrapment in the building during their investigations mean a fight for their way out.Wait a minute! For those who have watched the trailer, admit it, we all thought this was going to be a knock off of The Raid: Redemption's plot. On the surface, yes it does seem so, with highly trained police officers squaring off with thugs at every floor in order to survive and escape a building ruled by a ruthless drug lord, complete with personal quarters and a factory that churns out the narcotic. And what's with those loudspeakers for threat making, and the level of violence in both films? Yes they're fairly similar, and it's fair that one can expect a copy, but by the time Dredd rolls about in his Lawmaster cycle, and fire countless of rounds from his Lawgiver handgun, all notions of a knock off goes flying out the window, because this essentially developed into a Dredd movie, with deadpan humour that you know may be funny, but won't laugh because it's delivered in such grim fashion, and the level of visceral violence in the film makes it one that's rooted in science fiction fantasy, instead of martial arts credibility.And credit to that is Karl Urban's performance, with the actor seeing absolutely no need to lift that helmet like what Stallone did, and delivered a worthy Dredd performance that's a million times better than what Stallone can muster in a lifetime. He's a true bad ass who suffer no fools, cuts a bad mofo figure, and inhibits the spirit of the character through his ultra-serious performance, making you quake if you ever go head up with this judge, jury, and executioner. Stallone had to scream ""I AM THE LAW"" just to make himself heard, but Urban just has to whisper it in a calm and steady tone, and that's enough for one to pee in the pants, as he mows down anyone standing in his way with extreme prejudice, and chalks up the body count.Surprisingly Olivia Thirlby became an essential part of the narrative, as it provided a buddy cop movie perspective in Dredd, but without needless comedy. Put into the film to contrast not only in gender terms but the level of experience besides Dredd, she holds her own against Urban, and formed what would be the quintessential partnership that is truly memorable, and worked very well in the film. Lena Headey didn't have much to do here except snarl behind her made up, heavily scarred face, but had enough venom in her performance to make her Ma Ma convincing as the woman who managed to climb her way to the top of the thug food chain.While the Judges' uniform had its details trimmed down for functional purposes, take heart that the details put into the Lawgiver handgun, is something that will delight fans, together with CG and art direction that combined well to bring out the degree of glean, and rot on both the macro Mega-City One level, and indoors of the Peach Trees block. The soundtrack by Paul Leonard-Morgan also provided an additional punctuation for the set action sequences, as its hard industrial sounds fit right in to the attitude of Dredd, and provided a dark soul for the visuals on screen. It's been quite a while that I've been impressed by a film's score, and Leonard-Morgan's fit right into this movie's like hand in glove.Hopefully this British-South African production would be a sufficient hit at the box office to green light a sequel, because the good work had been set up and it's a pretty shame if it stops here, just like how Punisher War Zone grounded to a halt with the lack of a box office response. These films are options for more adult fare in the action genre complete with in your face violence and gore extremities, yet sticking true to and not insulting their roots by needlessly dumbing them down for a wider audience. For the action junkie in you that is not squeamish when heads get blown off, this is highly recommended!",Dredd
35,Mr-Fusion,Brutally effective,9,23 February 2015,"I'm trying to remember the last time I was this satisfied by an action/comic book movie, and nothing from the last several years is coming to mind. ""Dredd"" came from out of nowhere and just seemed to do everything right. The casting of Urban and Thirlby are ideal, the staging and camera work is refreshingly devoid of shakiness, and the world-building is excellent. We see just enough of Mega City One and learn just enough about Judge Dredd to get us up to speed and plunge right in. It's fast, clean and efficient.I can't say how faithful to the comic it is (alas, I haven't read it), so I can't compare this to the Stallone movie on that basis. But on its own terms, it's fantastic. It screams ""RoboCop"" and ""Mad Max"" (the judges are just the MPF taken to gleefully fascist lengths) and the replay value is off the charts.Something this savagely fun just doesn't come along everyday.",Dredd
36,siderite,"True(r) to the strips, it has a definite French feel to it, but should have been more",8,21 December 2012,"As far as American action movies go, this one is good. The plot is also simple and without the usual Hollywood lame backdrop stories: judges are the law enforcement agency in a huge megacity. They have the power to assess the situation and decide on a punishment; they are judge, jury and executioner. Of course, that wouldn't work anywhere else but in a movie, yet it is not that relevant. The entire flick is two of these supercops being trapped in a building filled with ""uncooperative perps"".I felt that the film resembled more a French action movie, rather than an US one. It is akin to Banlieue 13, with guns instead of Parkour. Lena Headey is as always perfect in the role of the assertive bitch and so the perfect villain of the film. Olivia Thirlby's role was less demanding. Any female actor could have played it. Karl Urban, with no scene in which to see his face - as in the original comics - was spot on as the indomitable Judge Dredd. I wouldn't say his role was very difficult either, but at least it was a well thought role and he acted it well.Yet the thing that bothered me was that the film was supposed to be a violent one and yet when the action was highest, the violence was censored. Red blotches instead of anatomically correct bodies or wounds, flashes of bright light for shocking scenes, etc. And we are talking here multiple bullets headshots at close range, skinned people, blown out hands and complete massacre from high powered Gatling guns. I have to tell you that, even without the US budgets, the French would have filled this film with gore and true horror.Bottom line: a rare type of action film in which some attention is given to script and characters and yet it remains true to action. I will see perfection when this cross breeds with European lack of taboos and shatters the current post-Victorian US media regime.",Dredd
37,Red-Barracuda,Pleasingly uncompromising comic-book adaption that isn't afraid to be nasty,9,11 September 2012,"I never bothered to watch the previous attempt to bring Judge Dredd to the screen. As soon as I heard that it starred a helmet-removing Sylvester Stallone I figured that the film-makers had dropped the ball immediately and unnecessarily. It seemed pretty obvious that the character of Dredd was one pretty clearly unsuited to a movie star vehicle movie. They should just have called it Judge Stallone. So it was with some interest when I heard that this new version was to feature an actor with enough self-confidence to not feel the need to remove his helmet at all; I was also interested to learn that the movie itself was unashamedly 18 certificate and nasty.Well, having seen it, I can happily report that this is exactly how Judge Dredd should be brought to the screen. Karl Urban is a great choice in the lead role; he brings the necessary brutality and amorality to the character. In these days of political correction in the movies, it makes quite a welcome change to just sit back and watch a hero who shoots first and doesn't even bother to ask questions later. Dredd in this film pleasingly – and correctly – has no story arc; he ends the film as he begins, ruthless and remorseless. The narrative itself is pleasingly focused and wastes no time whatsoever. It's effectively a violent action movie set within a tower block. It's very bloody indeed. In fact it's about as close as you could get to a $45,000,000 exploitation movie. But one with solid performances, some decent dialogue and inventive use of slow motion CGI. Aside from Urban there are two excellent female performers, namely Olivia Thirlby as the psychic Judge Anderson and Lena Headey as the villainess Ma-Ma. Thirlby has just the right mix of sex appeal, vulnerability and no nonsense ass-kicking, she also provides the humanity to the tale; while Headey makes for a fascinating and unpredictable choice as the chief baddie.The relatively small budget has possibly been an actual blessing. It's meant the film has a stripped down aesthetic and an effectively claustrophobic story. The denizens of Mega-City One aren't as futuristically attired as they are in the comic. They are more contemporary. This doesn't really harm the film as it gives it a grittier feel. Likewise the tough language and drug dealing villains make this a comic book adaption that has a feel of criminal realism that serves it well. It's science fiction in the vein of a film like Robocop. But, above everything, this movie is fun. Even the 3D was good. Let's hope there are more of these.",Dredd
38,KineticSeoul,"While lacking in story, it has some entertaining and gritty action",7,29 September 2012,"Some critics are saying this is a good action movie worth seeing and that it's way better than the trailer makes it out to be. In my opinion while it's a entertaining action popcorn flick it isn't that great of a movie. Like I said it's a fun action movie that has this quasi video game style and direction going for it. In fact this would have made a great video game but for a movie it's alright. Some scene are great visually while others are just mediocre at best and there is a lot of slow motion parts in this. This has a bit of B movie feel to it, especially when it comes to the violence. But it's a good B movie feel with quite a bit of violence and lots of action. The plot is about Judge Dredd(Karl Urban), who is judge, jury and executioner. And is a mentor and a trainer for Anderson(Olivia Thirlby) who is a psychic and can read people's minds. Anyways this duo gets trapped in a tower building on the first day of training by a drug lord Ma-Ma(Lena Headey) that is in control of the tower they are trapped in. and is in control of the crazy people with guns in the tower as well. Throw in some corrupt judges and you got yourself a fun action movie that while lacks in story is still a entertaining time. This isn't one of the best when it comes to B action movie style but it's still a good one one but just didn't seem great as some critics are claiming it to be.7.2/10",Dredd
39,Hellmant,Hearkens back to the glory days of B action films from the 80s and 90s!,9,27 September 2012,"'DREDD': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)2012 adaptation of the popular comic book about a future where America is overpopulated and riddled with crime and the police now have the power to immediately act as judge, jury and executioner. Karl Urban stars this time around as the title character 'Judge Dredd'. A role previously filled by Sylvester Stallone in a 1995 adaptation (and Urban does appear to be doing an amazing Stallone imitation). This film is not a sequel or a remake to the 1995 film, it's more of a reboot as it bares no relation to the other film at all. It co-stars Olivia Thirlby and Lena Headey and was directed by Pete Travis (who also directed the 2008 thriller 'VANTAGE POINT'). It was written by Alex Garland (who also wrote the excellent science fiction films '28 DAYS LATER', 'SUNSHINE' and 'NEVER LET ME GO' as well as the upcoming 'LOGAN'S RUN' remake and the highly anticipated 'HALO' film adaptation!). The movie is far superior to the 1995 Stallone vehicle and actually hearkens back to the glory days of B action films from the 80s and 90s!The film is set in a future United States (although it was filmed in South Africa) where the East Coast is made up of 800 million citizens and 17,000 crimes are committed each day. It's known as Mega-City One and the only form of law enforcement are police known as judges. They have the power to act as judge, jury and executioner and carry out sentencing immediately. The most notorious judge is Judge Dredd (Urban). He's just been assigned a new rookie recruit to test out, named Anderson (Thirlby), who is actually a mutant with psychic abilities. The two judges first respond to a murder call at a 200-story slum known as Peach Trees. They're ran by a vicious drug lord named Ma-Ma (Headey). When they threaten to expose her immense drug operation, she's running out of Peach Trees, of the drug known as Slo-Mo (which allows users to experience things at 1% their normal perception) she locks down the slum and has her army of enforcers hunt the judges down to kill them. The movie is a lot like the recent Indonesian action film 'THE RAID: REDEMPTION' in premise but it's even more like the classic 80s Sci-Fi action film 'ROBOCOP' in style and feel (it also has elements of other cult classics like 'BLADE RUNNER'). That's what I most love about the film, it's just a great throwback to the movies I loved growing up (most specifically 'ROBOCOP')! From the over the top gratuitous violence to the 80s sounding score, I felt like I was back in my childhood from the very opening scene. I've only seen the movie in 2D (so far) but I've heard the 3D visuals are some of the best ever done and I can't wait to see it that way. The directing was topnotch and the script was clever, funny and nostalgic. Dredd had just enough character development to stay true to the comics and not become overly cheesy. The best single thing about the movie has to be Karl Urban's performance though (who does so much with just his chin and mouth)! I liked Thirlby and especially Headey as the sexy femme fatale villain (she was one of the best parts of the film) but Urban really makes it classic and a film that begs for sequels. I can't wait to see where the franchise hopefully goes from here!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f6cH0dM_QmQ",Dredd
40,thesar-2,Not Even Dreddful,7,22 June 2013,"Admittedly, it's been (almost) decades since I've seen 1995's Judge Dredd with Sylvester Stallone as the title character and I've forgotten everything about it but my middling taste for it and Stallone's mangled ""I am da law!"" line. I have forgotten pretty much everything else about it as I only saw it once, in the theatre in first run theatres and I believe I gave it 2/5 stars.Fast forward 17 years, and the remake/reboot that never took off – sadly, is simply Dredd. Simply, as in, they cut the ""Judge"" out of the title. And, though I dredded to see this, I was thoroughly impressed and had a blast.Nicely cut at 95 minutes, you get all you need and no more out of a simple story of – yet, once again – the bleak future and two upstanding cops against the odds in a slum of a building.Dredd takes rookie and psychic, Anderson, out for a spin only to be trapped by Ma-Ma, who kinda, though un-hilariously, reminded me of ""Mom"" from Futurama by character alone, in her lair of scum and drug labs. Only, the bad guys trapped the absolute worst – to Ma-Ma, that is – ""judges""/cops from the ""Hall of Justice."" (That probably wasn't supposed to be a funny name for their headquarters, but that, too kept my focus on another cartoon: Superfriends' own Hall of Justice.)While the story's nothing new, Lena Headey, whom I will fondly remember as Sarah Connor on TV, did fairly well as Ma-Ma, Karl Urban's Judge Dredd gave me hope for the new Robocop reboot and Olivia Thirlby's rookie Anderson was decent. Also, for such a low budget, the graphics and sets were pretty good.Oh, and lest I forget, DAMN this is one of the goriest, bloodiest, most gruesome and hardest-R movies I've seen in a long time, action or horror or any genre. Kudos to them for not making it PG-13 to draw in the crowds and swaying from their vision of the dark future, though I cannot believe it wasn't NC-17. I've seen Saw sequels that had less carnage.Now, that all said, don't expect much – it's an almost leave-your-brain-at-the-door feature and the slow-motion scenes, though nicely explained, got kind of annoying after awhile. Overall, recommended for a nice Saturday night action film.",Dredd
41,cherold,taught and entertaining; also gory and ludicrous,6,5 January 2014,"There are some things I really like about Dredd. It's fast-paced and stylishly filmed. It's interesting that Dredd keeps his helmet on. The story is told economically.There are some things I have mixed feelings about. Dredd's tough-guy rasp borders on parody. The movie's pornographic approach to violence sometimes results in really striking imagery, but other times it just means way too much blood.And some things I don't like at all, most particularly the lack of sense shown throughout this movie. The head honcho's actions are not those of someone who could create a massive criminal syndicate. The whole idea that she would do all this to keep some information quiet is absurd; what on earth did she think would happen after she succeeded? There are several places where she could have ended everything and didn't for no reason beyond the director's not wanting her to. Exciting, flashy, humorless, effective, and an insult to my intelligence. That, in brief, is Dredd.",Dredd

43,Robert_duder,Just plain dumb. If Stallones version was bad...this must be complete trash,3,4 January 2013,"I know very little about the comic character of Judge Dredd. I have seen the Stallone version but it has been probably a decade or more. I remember it being extremely cheesy. I think I would take cheese over this debacle any day of the week. The worst part is that the film makers are making this under the pretense of being stylish I am sure of it. This was just ridiculous violent stupid crap. There was plenty of action, you won't be bored by the pacing but the plot is so convoluted and stupid that the action is just completely underplayed. The story is one of the weakest I have ever seen in an action film and the characters are so vapid and empty that you don't care about a single one of them. You are constantly barraged with what is supposed to be a stylistic cinematic experience obviously playing up the 3D angle but most of it seems so incredibly out of place. The slow mo blood spattering, and the body parts being exploded and squashed and ripped apart is a cool effect but completely out of place and just serves to remind you how little there is to this film. They could have skipped a script altogether and just spliced together shots of Judge Dredd blowing apart bad guys...oh wait, they did do that.If Karl Urban was supposed to use this as a stepping stone to an action career, he better pull up a booster seat. His portrayal of Dredd is completely vapid and empty. He has zero personality and while violent at times, shows nothing that will make you like him as a character. You don't root for him, you don't laugh at him, you just don't care. He is downright boring. It is probably mostly the scripts fault but either way he fails at it. Olivia Thirlby at least gets a character with some back story and some emotion but just barely. You will attach yourself just a little bit to her as a character but then by the end you don't care about her anymore than Dredd. The two of them together have zero chemistry and as heroes they are downright awful. There are no witty one liners or big heroic moments. Its one giant shootout with not plot and no good characters. Lena Headey (whom I really like) plays our villainess. She certainly looks the part and even has a semi-interesting introduction but they never go anywhere with it. She's basically just heading up one side of the giant shootout. Her special effects are cool but again...vapid character, no development, pointless. The chemistry between villain and hero doesn't exist even a little bit. These are you three main players in the film. The supporting cast doesn't even deserve a brief mention. I mean if they can't give life to their main characters the supporting characters don't have a chance in hell.Director Pete Travis clearly saw this as an opportunity to flex his creative muscles and go gangbusters on style. At first when the violence really starts I thought, okay this is gonna be a good old fashion R Rated Action flick but then the violence became so pointless and gratuitous and overblown that I was turned off by it. Watching a bullet in slow-mo pierce some guys flabby belly and watching it ripple...is not cool...its dumb. Its sort of what John Woo did to Mission Impossible 2...it just doesn't fit. But that isn't the issue with the film. The problem with the film is the absolutely deplorable script. How can you write a movie with absolutely no character development? How can you write anything like that? This is supposed to be an action hero movie and you literally don't even care a little bit about the action hero. Its just really poorly put together. The only reason I gave this any score at all is because the action is non stop, the opening scenes were decent and the special effects at times were interesting but this film is a mess and should be buried even deeper than Stallone's version. Let's just let Dredd stay in the comics. 3/10",Dredd

Dredd (Karl Urban) is one of the more renowned of the clan, and he has been assigned to babysit new recruit Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), a young rookie with inexplicable psychic abilities. They are called to Peach Trees, a crime plagued housing district where two grisly bodies have been found dumped, only to find themselves locked in by female crime boss Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) who offers a hefty reward for whichever gang brings her their heads.Judge Dredd is an old comic book that memorably (for all the wrong reasons, it seems) has already had a big screen outing in 1995 starring Sylvester Stallone, which this new, ultra violent update has brought stirring out the coils of people's memories. Of said memories, most appear to be pretty bad ones, as the film in many people's opinions was pretty disastrous, a memorable turkey, in fact. My abiding memory of it...is just that I don't remember it that well, so I'm not going to wade in to the post traumatic stress it seems to have stirred up in many. I can, however, focus on this new version for the YouTube generation, fast cut, stylistically violent and as instantly forgettable and disposable as most of the other cookie cutter action flicks hashed out nowadays.In a time when regurgitated old franchises are given modern day reboots by the dozen, this is as likely a candidate as any. Taking over from Stallone is Australian Urban, whose delivery is as flat and unemotive as anything the big man could muster. Given it's a role where a mask covers his face the whole time, this really isn't a problem. In the villain role, Headey takes a part you wouldn't expect a woman to play and is fittingly cold and mean. On other fronts, this is just as blatantly, shamelessly style over substance as you'd expect it to be, a threadbare plot the most apathetic excuse for a succession of mindless, blood drenched, slo-mo graphic violence to satisfy the target demographic, all seemingly aimed at those with the attention span of a depressed fly.From an outsider's perspective, it's a throw away and hollow as most action movies nowadays. But for modern, younger audiences, or even Dredd enthusiasts, it will probably serve it's purpose. **",Dredd

This gritty and true-to-the-comics adaptation has plenty of brutal action and sharp dialogue. The characters are relatable, the world is excellently painted and Urban's performance is on-point. The taut pace keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout, and it's this that is perhaps the piece's greatest strength. That, and the fact it is a proper adult science-fiction aimed at the same audience as its source-material. It doesn't compromise and feels almost like a pulpy 80s move in the best way possible, stripped back and bloodthirsty. It's a remarkable achievement considering its budget. 7/10.",Dredd
46,g-bodyl,A Good Dredd Modernization!,8,9 March 2014,"This film, Dredd is the next attempt to bring the beloved comic hero to screen, only seventeen years after the much-aligned Judge Dredd, which I have to yet to see. But by the looks of it, this film looks slick thanks to modern visuals and an updated screenplay. For the film itself, I did not love it, but I liked it enough. It's action-packed, full of creative visuals, and it doesn't rely on hordes of actors to carry the film.Pete Travis's film takes place in the future where the police act as judge, jury, and executioner. Judge Dredd is assigned a rookie cop and he takes her out on an assessment to a complex known as Peach Trees where a new, powerful drug is being developed by the gang and it's leader known as Ma-Ma.As mentioned before, this film does not rely on many actors to carry the film. First off, Karl Urban does a very good job and is totally unrecognizable. But that's the case because he does not take off his helmet, which stays true to the comic. Olivia Thirlby does a good job as well despite some rapid transformations of her psychic character. Lena Headey is a good villain and is hardly recognizable.Overall, Dredd seems to be a faithful adaptation of the comic. I really liked the visuals and makeup. There is no shortage of violence and body counts which will be bound to please people. I thought the use of slo-mo was a bit too much and used too often, but I know others do enjoy that. A crowd-pleasing actioner for sure. I rate this film 8/10.",Dredd

The action sequences are certainly an amazing spectacle, and the performances shine, particularly Karl Urban, who steals the show as Judge Dredd, completely bringing this well known comic book character to life. However, as far as action films go, it is nothing original, the twists and turns throughout are all very predictable, it never blew me away. The cinematography is terrific and succeeds at delivering a dark, gritty tone, but that is not enough to hide the lack of good storytelling, the plot simply moves from one objective to the other, without ever making any real impact. Great cast and stellar action, albeit lacking in depth, Dredd is worth the watch if you are looking for a mindless action, just do not go out of your way to see it. The lawman must fight countless vicious thugs after becoming trapped in a huge building. Best Performance: Karl Urban",Dredd

53,ironhorse_iv,I did not Dredd seeing Dredd. It was surprising a pretty good movie.,7,6 March 2014,"2012's Dredd did enough to help wipe out the memories of the Sylvester Stallone's 1995 film, Judge Dredd. Directed by Pete Travis, written and produced by Alex Garland, this gritty movie is based on the 2000 AD comic strip Judge Dredd created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra. Like the comic book, Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is a law government police officer given the power of judge, jury and executioner in a vast, dystopian overpopulation crime full metropolis called Mega-City One that lies in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Dredd teams up with an apprentice partner, Judge Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) a powerful psychic. Both of them, find themselves trapped in a 200-storey high-rise block of flats call 'Peach Trees' with a ruthless former prostitute turn criminal drug lord, Madeline Madrigal AKA Mama (Lena Headey) whom producing a drug call 'Slo-Mo"" that slows the user's perception of time to 1% of normal. It's never state out, if the drug is harmful or not, but when used, it's beautiful to watch. Great use of phantom camera, combining high-speed photography and color saturation as visuals. It's nice to watch even if the scenes are gory as hell. It's great to watch in 3D. Lot of excessive violence that match the comic book feel, but the movie lacks the satiric British humor elements. Most of the film is humorless. Thank goodness's no Rob Schneider in this movie. Also, the whole scope of the film seem limiting, as the film only keep the action in one area. No scenes in the wasteland. Megacity 1 here, doesn't look like the comic book. It was markedly less futuristic than the comic in order to be believable. I think they did it better here. It's hard to tell where the real slums of Cape Town, South Africa and New York City's landmarks end, and where the CGI fantasy made city began. Future cities less than hundred years might still look like this. The budget limited Mega-City One of such characters as robots and aliens. The Peace Tree building felt like a 1988's Die Hard because of the one area action sequences. The film seem a rip to 2011's The Raid in premise. The movie had a video game-like precision. The lawgiver gun has a lot of different settings like a game ranging from regular bullets to hotshot, incendiary, armor piercing, stun, and high explosive. Lawmaster motorcycle was a bit disappointing. The body count was really high in this film to the point, that I found that to be a bit unrealistic and the judges being untouchable. There is a few cheesy clichés like the speech on the loud speaker than reminds me of other action films like 1982's Rambo: First Blood. Lots of cheesy one liners as well. Dredd seem cool in the film, but I always thought of him as being bulky. Karl Urban is fit, but his body doesn't look like Dredd from the comics. Plus, I think that helmet was a little too big for Karl Urban. He look a bit silly, at times. Still, he does a good job. He never did once in the film, take off his helmet which comic books fans would like. He's supposed to be the faceless representative of the law and I think that works with his appeal. His raspy harsh voice can be go overboard like Christian Bale's Batman at times making it hard to understand what he is saying, but for the most part, he sound like what Dredd is supposed to sound like, Dirty Harry. Dredd did have more epiphany than deadpan that made him more human. In the film that definitely change over the course of the movie such as him joking or stunning some punk kids trying to kill him, instead of killing them. Regardless of his motives, he is also shown using the proper amount of force when needed and doesn't shoot to kill until the other options are expired. I like that Judge Cassandra Anderson can hold up her own, most of the film, and isn't a damsel in distress nor love interest type character. It was 100% professional between them. She give the movie some emotional depth that Dredd is lacking. Lena Headey is great. Before Headey was chosen, the character was described as a heavily made-up, scarred and obese older woman. I really don't see anybody pulling that obese woman off. Still, it would be cool to see the undead Judge Death in the film like one of the earlier draft had. I love all the background Easter eggs references to the comic book, from story lines, including ""Democracy"" (1986), ""Origins"" (2006), "" The Day The Law Died' (1978), (1995) 'The Pit' and (1980) 'Judge Child"". The Judge Dredd comic strips were originally conceived as UK satires of the Thatcher government and its authoritarian police like state. It was then put in a Reagan-era fantasy about the liquidation of the underclass. Many critics may hate the movie due to its incorporating obvious fascism, but it's never mention in the film. The Judge Dredd comics were not really about action or story-telling, but about showing how crappy extremist police states are. I never got that, as it's seem crime and chaos is winning this war. The movie is more anarchism than fascism. Dredd represent fascism/order and Ma-Ma represent anarchism/chaos both resort to fairly brutal means of killing their enemies and finding a way to scare the people for their personal will. To make the metaphor visual: when Ma-Ma get hurt, her blood briefly forms the red pattern that appears on a Judge's helmet. At less, the movie portray female characters great. Anderson as repeatedly shown to have power over men who underestimate her, while Ma-Ma displays more intelligence and sadism than any of her male gang members, and neither woman interacts with the other on the basis of their gender. Overall, my last judgment is that it's a good film.",Dredd

56,tomgillespie2002,Banishes all memory of the 1995 version,6,4 January 2013,"In future America, life is grim. The metropolis Mega-City One is a blur of skyscrapers and slums, overrun completely by violent crime. The only thing that stands in the way are the Judges, a force of justice where the gun-wielding officers play the role of judge, jury and executioner. The most fearsome, Judge Dredd (Karl Urban), is given the task of breaking in a young rookie, Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), a mutant psychic who failed the aptitude test to become a Judge, but still holds promise. Their first investigation, a triple homicide in which the victims were drugged and thrown from a tower block, leads them to Peach Trees, a notorious slum that is run by powerful drug lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey).After the complete disaster of Sylvester Stallone's 1995 depiction of Dredd, it would require bold steps when coming to produce a re-imagining and hopefully diminishing any memories of the previous film. Thankfully, director Pete Travis and actor Karl Urban have managed to create something close to the comic-book source - violent, dirty and over-the- top. The fact that Judge Dredd never removes his helmet requires an actor unconcerned about ego, and Urban, a seemingly humble and talented actor who has been mainly reduced to supporting roles (but proved himself to be a highly credible leading man in the excellent, little- seen thriller Out of the Blue (2006)) is perfect as the Judge - a stoic, bad-ass hero with questionable values who is the embodiment of a future without hope.The pessimistic, dystopian future the film creates is ripe for social and political observation, but the film sadly neglects this possibility in favour of something more simplistic and action-heavy. Sure, we want to see Dredd pump bullets into generic baddies, but without any deeper characterisation or satire, it's difficult to get too involved amongst all the gore and drug abuse. It resorts to a basic idea of Dredd and Anderson being trapped in a closed tower-block, facing an onslaught from Ma-Ma and her cohorts, and if anything, pursues a video-game aesthetic rather than anything comic-book-like. Playing out very much like a futuristic Die Hard (1988), it certainly offers much opportunity for Dredd to use his Lawgiver gun, designed to recognise his palm only, and can be changed to fire in various ways, yet this approach does get slightly repetitive, and offers nothing original or particularly inventive in terms of action cinema.Given it's low budget, the film certainly looks great. The special effects are suitably washed-out, and without that big-budget CGI sheen, give the film are earthier, grimy feel, similar in many ways to the great work done on District 9 (2009). The new drug on Mega-City One's streets that has Dredd and his fellow Judges on alert is known as Slo- Mo, named for the way is slows down the recipient's perception of time. This leads to some visual striking scenes and when watched in high definition, looks wonderful, especially the scene in which we meet Ma-Ma slumped in the bath, casually sucking in Slo-Mo as the smoke swirls around her. Sadly, Dredd's poor box-office will probably mean that there will be no sequel, but it is certainly enough to banish the memory of the 1995 version, and perhaps if DVD and Blu-Ray sales go well, we may yet see Urban don the famous helmet once again. And at least there's no Rob f*****g Schneider.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Dredd

Along came the JUDGE DREDD movie with Sylvester Stallone, and major disappointment. They just didn't get it. (Though the producers of ROBOCOP did, with Nancy Allen as Judge Anderson...) Finally, someone's done DREDD right- and, by so doing, has crafted one of the all-time finest comics-to-movies I've ever seen. Karl Urban is spot on as Dredd, and uber-sexy Olivia Thirlby is the finest Judge Anderson we're ever likely to see. (Note: Dredd never removes his helmet in the movie- in keeping with the comics-, which was a mistake they made in the laughable Stallone version.)

60,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A better '90s action movie than the first 'Dredd',7,5 March 2013,"My how things would be different today if in 1995, instead of getting Sylvester Stallone in ""Judge Dredd,"" we were treated to director Pete Travis' ""Dredd."" And I'm not just talking about visual effects advances in the last 17 years. ""Dredd,"" starring Karl Urban as the helmeted anti- hero, does classic, '80s and '90s-style action better than a lot of films in the '80s and '90s did. Forget needless character development and side plots — writer Alex Garland's (""28 Days Later ...,"" ""Never Let Me Go"") adaptation of the John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra comic drops us straight into the action and executes the plot with video game-like precision. Urban's Dredd is an immediately likable badass, armed with as many great one-liners as he has different kinds of ammunition in his all-in-one handgun-carbine hybrid.""Dredd"" plays out a lot like another of 2012's popular little action movies, ""The Raid: Redemption."" Both use the straightforward premise of a skilled hero trapped in a dangerous slum building controlled by a ruthless crime lord (in this case lady).Dredd is a judge of the Hall of Justice in Mega City One, a concrete jungle stretching from D.C. to Boston built amidst the ruins of the world that we know today. With crime rampant, judges are granted the powers of law enforcement and the legal system all rolled into one — judge, jury and executioner. All we know about Dredd is that he plays everything by the book, but he's far from a softie.The film occurs over the course of just a few hours. Dredd gets assigned to assess a rookie judge named Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), a young woman that that has failed most of the judge tests, but possesses powerful psychic abilities deemed valuable to the Hall. She joins him on patrol, though they both get more than just a test when they respond to a triple homicide call at a 200-story residence called Peach Trees. The building has been gang-controlled for years, but now just one woman rules the whole place, Ma-Ma (Lena Headey), a former prostitute who peddles an inhaled narcotic called Slo-Mo that causes the brain to experience time at a 100th of its normal speed. When Dredd and Anderson threaten her operation, she locks the building down with intentions of killing them. That's the gist of it. No side plots or secondary characters bogging things down, and Travis doesn't overindulge the sci-fi elements of the film either. All the futuristic technology is rather self-explanatory and none of it is integral to understanding the movie. It's all style. Technically, the Slo-Mo drug could have been any kind of drug in terms of fitting the purpose of the story, but it ends up crucial to creating the movie's visual identity..""Dredd"" is an exceptionally bloody film, yet most of it is CGI, so its violence is comparable to the quality of a really graphic video game. Actually, think of the most graphically bloody video game you've played and up the level of gory detail. Lots of smashed in heads and stuff. It would be great if it didn't look as fake, but it fits with the extremely lucid, glossy aesthetic of the movie.Slow motion will usually cheapen the look of a film because it's so overused, but Travis works it in as part of the charm. It's so violent and fast-paced that allowing the audience to experience certain scenes ""under the influence of Slo-Mo"" radically changes the look and feel of what's going on and helps form the film's thumbprint.One-liners will do the same thing as bad slow motion, but a majority of these lines work really well between the context they're used in and Urban's delivery. Most of the time a writer has to completely contrive them, but Garland crafts these zingers exclusively based on what's happening in the film. He only reaches in a couple of instances. ""Dredd"" has a bizarre sense of humor between the dialogue and some of the lewd sequences that occur as the script starts to play around with Anderson's psychic powers. During much of the film, she has captured one of Ma-Ma's men (Wood Harris, ""The Wire"") and he tries to freak her by picturing sexual episodes between them in his head. These scenes can't exactly be deemed necessary, but they at least prove Anderson's psychic powers aren't just about having a convenient way to advance the plot.Despite opportunities for all the actors to chew the scenery, none do. Headey has learned a thing or two about playing villains from ""Game of Thrones"" and Ma-Ma is a sickly subtle villain to be sure, while Urban does a better Christian Bale gruff-voiced Batman than Christian Bale does. The movie doesn't tell you anything about the man behind the helmet, but by the end, you wouldn't mind learning a thing or two if there's ever a sequel.""Dredd"" keeps thing incredibly simple, entertaining and gleefully violent. That's not everyone's cup of tea — the style of the movie could definitely be considered too niche for mainstream tastes — but regardless of how good you might feel it is, there's no question that in executed a stupidly simple story so well, ""Dredd"" makes bad action movies that try to do too much look that much worse. No one will ever label ""Dredd"" an action classic of the early 2010s, but it will stand the test of time better than anyone expects.~Steven CThanks for reading!

62,Vartiainen,Exhilarating violence and a compact story arc,9,17 December 2012,"Now this is more like it! Finally a scifi action film that doesn't play around and is willing to take its audience seriously. No cheap Hollywood clichés or downplaying of violence to lower the age rating. Rather this film reminds me of the grindhouse art style. The focus is on the unbelievably well-shot action scenes, the practical effects and the characters, like it should be.I also absolutely love the storyline here. Some reviewers have complained about the fact that practically the whole film takes place in one megablock, one huge building, and that we don't get to see more of the city or the landscape. Well, I can sort of understand their reasoning, but I actually think that the story here is enough. Besides, the budget of this film was rather tight, so it's perfectly understandable for them to go with this route. Especially when they make it work like this. Because in a way this is a slice of life film. For us this seems like a grandeur war against a major drug cartel, which escalates beyond all belief, but for Dredd it's actually just another day like any other, which just proves to showcase what a badass he is as a character. Anything more sweeping or major would have actually downplayed him as a character.Besides, even within a single building we get pretty much all we need. We have multiple different locations and battlefields. We have various side characters, which all seem to have stories and personalities of their own, which fleshes out the world of Dredd. And we have our villain organization, led by the infamous Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) , though I must admit that she was probably the weakest link in this film. She gets a very nice introduction scene or two, but then her character arc seems to grind to a screeching halt and we don't learn much more about her, which is a shame as she had potential as a villain. She still does her job in the story, but she could have been more.Luckily the two main characters, Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) and Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), don't have the same problem as they're both very good characters and they complement each other very well. Thirlby's Anderson was a topic of much discussion before the film came out as she seemed to be very clichéd rookie character. The kind that always needs saving, is very naive, but eventually learns to stand up for herself without giving up her ""thou shalt not kill"" values. Luckily for us she proved us wrong. She has several aspects of those said clichés, but they're either perfectly justified or given a twist, or even downright ignored. She's a strong character, who feels like a rookie, as she should, but still manages to prove her worth. The best part of the film is by far Karl Urban's Dredd, however. He plays the role perfectly in my opinion. An extremely tough law enforcement machine that still has a sense of justice left in him, an incorruptible legend that's still down to earth and not willing to play anyone's game but his. And... he never takes of his goddamn helmet! I cannot stress enough how important that is. Judge Dredd as a character never takes of his helmet. He doesn't need to. That helmet is his face, and it's an enormous relief that Urban recognized this fact and didn't demand some kind of cheap face time to promote himself.On the technical side of things, this is a surprisingly sleek-looking film, given the budget. The Peach Trees Block looks great with muted colours, rust and towering central space. The same with the judge's armor, which has been given a more realistic spin when compared to the comics, which is a plus in my books. The 3D was also surprisingly effective, partly because it only got really used in the drug-induced SLO-MO scenes, where the vibrant colours and gory bodily fluid explosions really got to shine.I highly recommend this film to all fans of violent action films. It mixes a comic book story arc with grindhouse aesthetic and manages to produce a film that's unforgiving, relentless and filled with great action scenes and characters. One of my favourite films of 2012 and definitely one of my favourite comic book adaptations of all time.",Dredd
63,jtindahouse,Awesome movie!,9,17 January 2014,"'Dredd' is like a combination of a Batman movie where he didn't have his one rule not to kill anybody and a futuristic Die Hard where Bruce Willis wears a mask. The second part may not sound that appealing but the first part certainly does (at least to me). This movie was awesome!The body count is enormous. I love films where the filmmaker isn't under any restrictions on violence levels and this was definitely one of them. There is zero humour from start to finish and this works well. It's not that it takes itself too seriously, just that it is setting a serious tone and atmosphere.Karl Urban is brilliant in his role. He absolutely nails the voice and the jaw acting is some of the finest you'll see. Olivia Thirlby plays her role well but is nothing special. Lena Headey however blew me away. It could be considered a risky move making the main villain a female in a film like this, but she puts any doubters to shame. She was intense, menacing and a worthy foe (albeit mostly strategically) for Dredd.The movie is well written and directed and the story works well. I was skeptical early on about the character of Anderson having psychic powers, but it added an interesting element to a lot of scenes and by the end I was convinced it was a smart attribute to give her. The fake drug used in the film was also a clever addition and allowed for some great shots. Definitely one not be missed, whether you're a comic book fan or not.

64,hellraiser7,Super Cop,10,26 September 2012,"I'm a fan of the comic series ""Judge Dredd"" and this film was one of those films I've been waiting to happen in a long time, and I wasn't disappointed this film was a dream come true for me.It's true the plot and story is straightforward but that's a good thing, it makes the film feel no nonsense let alone we don't have to worry about a bunch of boring melodrama or unnecessary complexity that can grind the story and film to a halt. It also makes sense because most of the stories in the comic series were always straightforward and simple. Let alone the action format, it's pretty much your one or few against the world scenario but that's my favorite kind because it's always fun to think of the possibility of surviving and beating the odds.I like the production value most of it is practical, there's a little CGI but not much and hardly noticeable. I really like the look of the city of the future it feels accurate to the comic books where it is in between both our contemporary present we live in but also futuristic with certain technologies we haven't yet mastered. I even like the concept of the Megablocks which are a city within, they kinda look a bit like a shopping mall, with our malls today this isn't far fetched it feels plausible. The action is great well choreographed, not quite wall to wall but that's a good thing because it actually feels a bit realistic. It's gory and visceral, there are some creative kills, my favorite was seeing Dredd shoot a High Ex round at a perp which takes his head off completely. As well as the music which is reminiscent of John Carpenter's films. But most importantly I just loved the suspense and atmosphere of the film, like in the Carpenter films there is that constant feeling of isolation and dread; as there is that looming threat of a gang of scumbags hiding in the next corner, shadow or even apartment door.Support character Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) she's decent and is useful from her psychic ability. Ma-Ma (Lena Headey)is a worthy opponent, she is unlikable psychotic drug lord that wants things her way but also simply wants to kill for no reason. However, were in this movie for Dredd and the character doesn't disappoint. Karl Urban performance was excellent he is Judge Dredd. He just does everything right, from the fact he never takes the helmet off throughout the whole movie which is his trademark in the comics, to me that is his face because represents the facelessness of the law. But most importantly it just gives Dredd a sense of mystique. The character it's true he doesn't have a great deal of depth, but doesn't need it Dredd is simply the job an all action type. The voice he uses is great it's how I imagined what Dredd would sound like, sort of a Clint Eastwood like tone. He has some great lines my favorite is no surprise, ""Ma-ma's not the law, I'm the law."" He's got charisma, he's kinda funny in an unintentional sense, most importantly tough as nails he makes criminals haul butt. But I simply liked his performance physically some of Karl Urban's training really shows. Most of all just loved seeing him use trademark weapon The Lawgiver which is my favorite fictional weapon of all time. Whatever you think of saying it will discharge, if you said laser then the gun would shoot a laser bolt.Dredd has plenty of fire power.Rating: 4 stars",Dredd
65,BeneCumb,"Externally effective, internally shallow",6,2 January 2013,"The plot has so many clichés and in-the-box thinking, that it becomes annoying at times; beginning with the question that will guns, vehicles, apartment blocks etc etc be really similar-shaped than now? And will IT guys still be long-haired nerds?! In works with sci-fi or futuristic inclination, I would like to see lots of innovative elements and scenes. This Dredd-movie has too few of them. Related movies with more emphasis on ""soul"" have been made.As for the cast, only Karl Urban as Judge Dredd and Lena Headey as Ma-Ma are pleasant to follow, the rest are not memorable at all. Many dialogs are artificial and do not provide any additional value.The movie is not a total flop, but I cannot see any reason why this topic - activities of a single person as judge-jury-executioner - had to be revived. And why it is so popular in world cinemas...",Dredd
66,DarkVulcan29,Puts the 1995 film to shame.,9,23 September 2012,"Ya'll remember the 1995 film Judge Dredd that starred Sylvester Stallone as the title character, not to mention a very annoying Rob Schneider, I'm sure some you would like to forget. Everything that made the comic book popular was totally ignored to make a silly action film, now 17 years later, it gets a reboot and they finally did it right.In a ruined future Judge Dredd(Karl Urban) and rookie Judge named Anderson(Olivia Thirbly) who is also a psychic, become trapped in a high rise after a drug bust, by Ma Ma(Lena Headey) an evil drug lord, in order to keep them from getting out alive,cause they one of her hench men in custody. Will Dredd and Anderson get out alive? Karl Urban is awesome here, he plays the character has he was meant to be portrayed. Olivia Thirlby is also good too. Lena Headey is great as Ma Ma, she is evil to the core. I liked the gritty look at the future, nothing really glorified. And not to mention it did have some great shoot out scenes.

That's really all there is too it.I mean, I could talk about how it lacked the...whatever, that the original had, but the honest fact is that the original didn't really have anything going for it to make it better than the reboot.The first one was bad.The second one was bad but looked better.Ultimately there is nothing to either of them.",Dredd
68,freemantle_uk,I Fought the Law and the Law won,7,18 September 2012,"The new cinematic version of the famous comic book anti-hero Judge Dredd will guarantee the eradication of the memory of the ill-fated Sylvester Stallone version. Director Pete Travis and writer Alex Garland have brought a grim, gritty and violent version of the comic to the screen that will please fans of the 2000 AD creation.The future is hell. The world's population has decreased to 800 million and it is mostly a wasteland. Mega City One spans from Boston to Washington D.C. and it is a chaotic, lawless place where crime, poverty, rioting and unemployment are persistent. Only the Palace of Justice and the Judges bring any form of law and order and the best of them is Judge Dredd (Karl Urban). Dredd is assigned to assess a rookie Judge, Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), who has failed the exams but has psychic abilities. The two have a hell of a first day when both Judges are trapped in the Peach Trees tower block by an intelligent and sadistic crime lord, Ma-Ma (Lena Headey), who controls the distribution of a new drug called Slo-Mo and wants them dead.Travis injects a mixture of styles into Dredd, the brutal violence and action of classic '80s movies, the grim grittiness of both modern sci fi and comic book movies, and hyper-stylised slow-motion that has been constant in action cinema for the past five years. The world created for the movie is bleak, a horrific concrete jungle of tower blocks and highways and most of the vehicles are old, beaten-down cars and vans. Cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle shows a deliberately murky city in a giant, decaying, smog-filled world, and a distinctive score provides a unique tone. The violence itself very gory with an anime quality to it in the way brains and blood get splattered all over the place. Even the 3D works well during the detailed slo-mo scenes.Although Dredd is in set in a gritty world, it is a movie that is accepting of its comic book elements of psychic powers, mutants and technology; there is no holds barred on the violence and sexual content either. The use of Ma-Ma as the villain and the casting of Headey shows the filmmakers' dedication to a villain who is intelligent and deliciously sadistic, someone who enjoys pain and ultra-violence. But her aims and methods are more moderate because she is a crime lord, not some grand sci-fi schemer.Dredd succeeds in setting a dark futuristic gritty tone and look, though the story the film offers is bare bones. The simple plot involves Dredd and Anderson trapped in a tower block trying to take down a crime lord. It's actually easy to compare this one to The Raid from earlier this year, in which the heroes go in to building to take down crime boss but end up having to fight for their survival. The story plays it safe and allows the filmmakers to focus on getting the tone right to please the fans.For a movie with a budget of $45 Million the CGI and special effects were of a high standard, but it was also limited because of majority of the movie takes place in a limited location of a grey, dark, concert tower with lots action set in corridors. There is a fun car chase in the beginning, showcasing the movie's new found violence, but most of the action is internal shootouts. The action is still solid and enjoying and if a sequel is made it will be more expansive.Dredd and Anderson represent two different views on justice in this world. Dredd is hard-boiled and experienced, willing to use violence and torture to fulfil his duty to protect innocent people. Anderson is more compassionate, someone who suffers guilt and has to learn quickly to use force. Both have to learn from else other to issue justice logically in this world.It is great for Urban to finally get a leading action role. He is much better than the Stallone version, and he gives the character the hard-boiled edge he needed. At times, his voice is simply his own with an American accent, while at others he speaks in a gravelly Batman voice. Urban may not have the biggest physical stature, but he felt fitting to the role overall. And while Dredd lacks the satirical edge the comics are known for, Urban makes sure that his character has a dry wit and the script offers some one-liners and occasional moments of dark humour. For die-hard fans, he never takes the helmet off and the most you will see is the back of his head.Dredd will please fans of the comics longing for the more violent incarnation of their favourite character. It earned a rare 18 rating in the UK, which should tell you something about what you are in for. Dredd shows there is still a place in the modern cinematic landscape for R-rated sci-fi movies.Please visit www.playeraffinity.com",Dredd
69,JoeB131,That was Dredd-ful,4,14 December 2014,"Did you see what I did there? Anyway, this movie continues the awful trend of making movies that are barely distinguishable from video games, with the expected result.There's just enough dialog between shooting scenes to move the plot along to the next level.I give this movie a bit of credit for playing the material straight, unlike the Sly Stallone atrocity of a few years ago. It actually respects the source material (which I'm not fan of), so it has that going for it But beyond that, it's just a big dumb action film with a character you don't care about all that much.",Dredd
70,estebangonzalez10,The film Dredd fans were waiting for,7,2 October 2012,"¨Inhabitants of Peach Trees, this is Judge Dredd. In case you have forgotten, this block operates under the same rules as the rest of the city. Ma-Ma is not the law... I am the law. ¨ Judge Dredd is certainly the law in this new attempt at bringing the comic book hero to the big screen. Where the film starring Sylvester Stallone failed miserably in 1995, here it gets everything right from the very beginning. This is the film Dredd fans were waiting for, and they won't be disappointed with Karl Urban's portrayal of him, who loses himself completely in the character. I really had no high expectations for this movie since I'm not a big fan of Dredd or the comics, and I hated the 1995 version as well so I wasn't really looking forward to this. I usually don't like films that are entirely focused on the action and have very little character development, but here the action hooked me completely thanks to some incredible visual effects and a cool premise. A premise that we've seen before (especially for those of us who have seen The Raid Redemption which surprisingly has a very similar storyline to this one although screenwriter Alex Garland {The Beach, Sunshine, 28 Days Later} had written this way back in 2007) but works anyway thanks to some excellent visuals. Dredd 3D isn't as good as The Raid Redemption because there is no martial arts here, but it's still a lot of fun and well worth your time. I really enjoyed this film, the 3D effects are really great (coming from someone who doesn't really enjoy 3D films either) thanks to some slow motion action sequences that are completely justified in the movie. The film works really because Judge Dredd doesn't need any character development, the less we know about him and his past the better because he simply represents the law. More than a character, Dredd is a symbol for justice, and that is exactly what we get.The film directed by Peter Travis (Vantage Point and Endgame) is set in an apocalyptic dark future where America is mostly a waste land due to radiation. Everyone is concentrated in what are called Mega Cities. Mega City One extends from Boston to Washington DC, a highly populated and cemented area where the crime rate is so high that the judges can attend only 6% of the calls. Judges are the police force and also have the power to act as jury and executioners. They are feared by the general public, and among them Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is perhaps the most respected of all. On an ordinary day he's assigned to partner with rookie Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) and evaluate her in order to see if she can be assigned judge. Despite failing her exams, Chief Judge (Rakie Ayola) wants to give Anderson another shot due to her special psychic abilities which might come in handy in the force. Therefore Dredd and Anderson on duty respond to a call in Peach Trees, a 200 story vertical slum where few judges ever dare enter. Once they enter the complex, they discover that it's controlled by a drug lord named Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) who is expanding her business through a new drug called SLO-MO that allows your brain to experience reality at 1% speed. Once the two judges enter the building, they are locked in by Ma-Ma who commands the inhabitants of Peach Trees to eliminate them before they interfere in her business. The odds are against the judges, who must face the hundreds of criminals inside the slum on their own.As I mentioned before, it's good that Judge Dredd has no character arc whatsoever, because he is more of a symbol. Karl Urban plays him masterfully by making the viewers forget they are watching a performance. He wears the mask that covers most of his face for the entire film. All we can see of Urban's face is his mouth and chin. He really is Dredd and makes us forget there is actually an actor behind that mask. Dredd is practically emotionless, his only emotion seems to be anger, and Urban understands that his performance must be as selfless as possible. Who gets to show more emotions is Olivia Thirlby who gives a strong performance as the rookie. We care for her character who unlike Dredd has a lot of emotions and can be sympathetic. She can also be tough, but for the most part she wants to make a change for the better in people's lives. Her character gives the movie a soul. Even ruthless Ma-Ma doesn't seem to show much emotions, so the whole thing kind of centers around Thirlby's performance. The film wouldn't be as good without her. Several things about her character are kind of left untold, hinting as to a possibility that there might be a sequel. I really enjoyed this film, and thought the slow motion effects were done really well. Dredd 3D is a very entertaining film.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",Dredd
71,Fluke_Skywalker,The true spiritual successor to RoboCop,7,11 November 2014,"To the vast majority of the public, the name Judge Dredd conjures up images of the cheesy, overblown Sylvester Stallone action movie from the mid-90s. It's not long into this recent reboot that the stigma of the original film is completely obliterated forever.Feeling like a spiritual successor to Paul Verhoeven's 1987 cult classic 'RoboCop'--certainly more so than its own remake--'Dredd' is an uncompromisingly violent tour de force that is balanced by its subtle, satirical wit.The tightly focused story--the bulk of which takes place in massive nightmare high rise--never stops moving, and the game cast take what could've been cardboard cutouts and breath real life into them.In an age of neutered, CGI-filled PG-13 action films, 'Dredd' is a welcome return to the spirit of the R-rated flicks of yersteryear.",Dredd
72,juneebuggy,a non comic book fan's view,4,21 December 2014,"Well I couldn't get into this at all, which was too bad because its supposed to be a truer rendition than Stallone's fun but cheesy attempt back in 95. Lots to like here in terms of world building, special effects and cool gadgets but completely overshadowed by gratuitous gory violence and endless video game style killings that just go on and on.Karl Urban is also completely wasted in this role (actually I'm not entirely sure it was ever him) because not only does he never show his face, he barely speaks. In fact his character was so vague that it could have played by any random extra on set. And without including any back story (for non comic book fans like myself) I felt zero attachment to his plight. I don't know who he is and I don't care if he makes it out of ""Peachtree"" alive or not.We join (Urban) as some futuristic lawman at another day on the job, dispensing his brand of justice as judge, jury and executioner. After he ventures into an inner city block tenement housing (to the extreme) with a rookie cop, Dredd incurs the wrath of the ruthless drug lord Ma-Ma (played awesomely by a scarred up Lena Headley).Lots of bad guys die in gory ways, Dredd has a cool voice controlled gun, the future looks bleak. 11/30/14",Dredd

This movie is dark & gritty & full of danger,this is the real world of Judge Dredd captured perfectly on screen & it's BEAUTIFUL.Dredd is played perfectly by the EXCELLENT underrated KARL URBAN & he is the best Dredd we will ever have!!! Urban plays Dredd like a pissed off angry as hell CLINT EASTWOOD mixed with the take no crap brutality of CHARLES BRONSON & he's fantastic to watch. This is Urban's best movie & best performance.No need to go into all the story as hundreds already have so all I'm gonna say is this film is AMAZING!!! if you like brutal sci-fi films like the first ROBOCOP (1987) or MAD MAX 2 (1981) or even ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK (1981) you will love this movie!!! DREDD is trapped in An ultra violent crime infested city Tower block with his new trainee & have to fight their way out & it's AWESOME!!!.Anderson is also a fantastic character & new recruit as a rookie Judge partnered with Dredd. She's tough & smart & has mutant powers a fantastic character & performance.Dredd is also one of if not the best remake of all time!!!
Dredd wipes the floor with the ultra cheesy 1995 Stallone film that yes i like it & it's a fun pure 90's film that i grew up watching but Dredd is better in every single way!!!!
The music is also fantastic & has an old school 80's vibe to it like if John Carpenter made a Dredd movie this world be it!!!!!Dredd is a real throwback to 80's gritty futuristic films with in your face brutal violence & bone crunching action & the whole atmosphere is dark,gloomy & gritty & full of danger.
An easy 10/10 for this true cult classic & EASILY deserves a place up there with other futuristic sci-fi Classic's like Blade runner,Robocop,Total Recall, the Terminator & Escape from New York!!!Also i have to add that the world that is portrayed in Dredd isn't that far off from now as the world is only getting much worse & the violence out there is getting out of control along with the ever rising crime rate so dredd is much closer than you may think!!!
I also have to add that i think we need tough cops like dredd for real & i TOTALLY agree with how he handles the scum & thugs out there & i think that's how cops in the future will have to be like to try & get some sort of order in this crime ridden & corrupted world because the justice system doesn't work at all.DREDD is one of the greatest movies ever made in my opinion & is in my top 10 fave movies.",Dredd
74,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Flat out spectacular,10,22 July 2016,"After the floundering absurdity that was 1995's Judge Dredd left a nasty taste in the collective mouths of fans, all went quiet on the cinematic front of Dredd for nearly two decades (I call it the Batman & Robin effect). The clouds parted though, and we finally got one streamlined masterpiece of a flick with 2013's Dredd. Not only is it achingly faithful to the comics right down to Dredd never removing his helmet, but it stands as one of the ballsiest and well made action pictures in recent years. It's never overstuffed or busy, takes the violence seriously, has genuine suspense, a bone deep and super tough performance from a grizzled Karl Urban, a sexy, no nonsense villain and the best original score of 2013 by a country mile. Not too mention it's atmospherics, which are helped by said score of course, to create a sonic mood board of post apocalyptic ruin and urban rot. Dredd is part of an elite department called the Judges, who roam the smoky desolation of Mega City One and act as judge, jury and executioner wherever they see fit. Dredd is a trigger happy juggernaut with no use for scum or criminals and has not a qualm with taking them out like the trash they are, often in brutal, bloody and uncompromising ways. On day he's partnered up with judge in training Cassandra (Olivia Thirlby, perfect), a rookie with blossoming telepathic abilities. A routine call leads them to a gargantuan Mega Block tower called Peach Trees, a sting irony once we see the rampant squalor inside. This tower happens to be controlled by the fiercest criminal overlord in town, Ma Ma, played by a purring, lethal and altogether terrifying Lena Headey. Her tactics go beyond barbaric and she's sitting on the manufacturing of a drug called Slo Mo, which makes the users feel like time is passing at one percent it's normal rate (a gold mine for setting up a scene visually). Ma Ma locks down the tower as the two judges arrive, and decrees that she wants them dead. Now it's a visceral fight for survival against her armies of thugs and miscreants, and a slow ascent towards her penthouse lair, for Dredd to finish her off. The whole film takes place in Peach Trees, so it's a self contained, one location affair, and a goddamn knockout of a movie. There are R rated films that dabble in violence a bit and barely earn their stripes, and then there are R rated films that leap at the chance to show people dying six ways to Sunday. Dredd absolutely decimates Ma Ma's armies in high style and often in super slow motion as they face him while they're high. The slo mo never feels tacky, but has a tactile richness and fluidity that makes the inflicted carnage so satisfying as it unfolds. The score by Paul Leonard Morgan is an uproarious rallying call that drives forward constantly, charging out of the gate in the opening minute as Dredd pursues a van down the highway on his thundering motorbike, and pummelling each scene with heart stopping force until it mellows out for an eerie passage called 'Ma Ma's Requiem' which is my favourite piece in the film and can be listened to on repeat. Pure genius. Thirlby is the voice of reason and the eyes of the audience, experiencing for the first time how ugly this crime fighting business is, and holding her own wickedly. There's a dark sense of danger to the whole thing, a frank and outright lawlessness to the villains, as it's just another day on the job for them. No overacting, no histrionics. Just mellowed out murder and meanness all round. This is the Dredd film that we've been waiting for, and have long deserved after that other mess. Low box office returns means we may never see a sequel (wtf is wrong with people, like, who didn't go see this??), but we'll always have this little blitzkrieg of a flick to re watch time and again. I know I will.",Dredd
75,peterp-450-298716,Bloody unfussy uncensored action ... Perfect !,7,23 March 2014,"""How the f*ck are we gonna stop this guy?"" ""Call 911.""Connoisseurs of the eponymous comic know that Dredd is rough, raw and contains brutal violence scenes in a gray and dark society where there is no future for the average person and crime rules. Judge Dredd reigns in this petty and aggressive society with a strict and ruthless brutal hand. The figure Dredd can be seen as a Robocop-like person with anabolic inflated muscles whose face is covered by his helmet all the time so we can only see a bitter grimace with somewhat frightening-looking razor sharp teeth. He's blunt,rude and there is no room for negotiation. That's my vision on the comic.And this movie corresponds accurately with the description of the comic as described earlier. Compared to this movie, Judge Dredd from 1995 with Sly is the Walt Disney version. The latter is terribly soft, clean, bloodless and suitable to watch with the complete family. This version on the other hand is full of action and straight-in-your-face violence with accompanying gore pictures and bloodshed. I admit, the story isn't really the epitome of subtlety and far-reaching inspiration. Dredd is accompanied by a mutant who is a rookie (the only notable acting performance) and send to a crime haven with three suspicious suicides. Turns out it's actually an ordinary execution in the drug scene where a certain Ma-ma rules.This Ma-ma ensures, with the help of another mutant, a lock-down of the big mega skyscraper Peach Trees, to prevent a gang member being taken for questioning. What follows is a race to the top floor and confrontations with all local gangs (which I thought no longer existed) and eventually ends up in a end-fight with the supreme boss Ma-ma. Nothing earth shattering but the whole film is infused with action and ultra-hardcore violence. The slow motion images look ""stunning"" and gives a clear picture of the impact of the new ""Slow-mo"" drug.The only minuses were:The fact that the corrupt judges knew they were going after the famous Judge Dredd, means that they should have known that he was accompanied by the rookie Anderson who had some psychic powers. The judge who went after rookie Anderson could have figured out that Anderson would know immediately what the plan was. Kind of silly. - The end of Ma-ma could be better portrayed. A Slow-Mo free-fall with a spectacular splashing end. That would fit better into the overall picture of this movie.You can't say much about the acting performance of Karl Urban. Any nitwit with a good posture and grim face could play this part. The only thing shown throughout the movie was the lower part of his face.Amusing Friday night movie with bloody unfussy uncensored action.

77,a_chinn,"Finally, the Judge Dredd film adaptation we were waiting for!",8,25 May 2020,"I'm a huge Judge Dredd fan from way back, so it's great to see a film version that gets it right. The Stallone film was a pretty abysmal experience for 2000AD fans, though I'll say that film's production design is closer to the Mega City 1 of the comics than this new version, who's Mega City 1 looks more like Old Detroit in ""RoboCop"". However, that's not necessarily a bad thing. I loved the grittiness of this version and it totally works. This film is to Stallone's Judge Dredd what Christopher Nolan's Batman is to Adam West's Batman. There's really no comparison. Karl Urban nails the character's hard-as-nails, uncompromising, and grizzled nature. And yes, he keeps the helmet on the entire film. Olivia Thirlby plays rookie Judge Anderson, a significant character in the Dredd universe if you follow the comic, and does a fine job. The story is a pretty stripped down one that has Dredd and Anderson trapped in a mega block, fighting off crime lord Lena Headey's army. Headey doesn't want Dredd and Anderson to leave the block with an underling who might incriminate her and her drug operation. The story bears a strong resemblance to Gareth Edward's ""The Raid"" but manages to hold it's own and feel like it's own film. Director Pete Travis constructs some amazing action sequences and maintains a serious tone compared to the jokey Stallone film. None of Travis' previous work stood out all that much to me, but it's recently come to light recently that Travis was kicked off of the film's post production process and editing was taken over by writer Alex Garland, who's contribution was considered significant enough for him to seek a co-director credit. Urban has said in interviews, ""A huge part of the success of 'Dredd' is in fact due to Alex Garland and what a lot of people don't realize is that Alex Garland actually directed that movie."" Regardless of who gets directing credit, it's a visually stunning film that features some amazing photography from Danny Boyle's regular director of photography, Anthony Dod Mantle. But I remember the first time I saw this film, I walked away from it with even more respect for Garland. He's written smart genre pieces like ""28 Days Later"" and high minded art-house films like ""Never Let Me Go,"" and with ""Dredd"" he's crafted a nearly perfect pulp action flick. Going back to comparisons with the Stallone version, Garland clearly understands the Dredd universe and knows what fans wanted to see. The helmet staying on in this film was indicative of why this film worked and the Stallone film did not. Dredd was never really the star of the comics. What made the comics interesting was Mega City 1 and people who inhabit it. Dredd is essentially a robotic long arm of the law and simply a badass dude (though this has recently changed somewhat in the comics where he's questioned the fascist nature of the Judge's role). I may have been biased towards this film being a big longtime 2000AD fan, but I'm positive this is a film that would easily appeal to a wide audience. A terrific action flick. Boy do I hope there's a sequel!",Dredd
78,robertemerald,"Excellent sci-fi action, but not as grand as Judge Dredd",8,6 June 2019,"I've seen this movie at least twice. It's impressive. There are a few brief landscape horizons that set a tone, and they are very futuristic. But unlike Judge Dredd (1995), a movie that had futuristic written all over it, the action here takes place in a tower block, big and high tech though it is, but to be honest, most of the effect departments on this movie must surely have worked on guns and splatter. The guns and splatter are good, mind-blowing even, and for me that was highly enjoyable. Dredd is unashamedly an action movie, high ballistic and high explosive, with the sci-fi as a sort of window dressing. If anyone from Hollywood is reading this, well, how about a third instalment, the same universe, but something completely different again? If you did that you could have a new and very special franchise on your hands. Just a thought.",Dredd
79,davidmvining,I am the Law,10,20 November 2019,"Picking up the Pieces
The comic Judge Dredd was made into a film once before as an action vehicle for Sylvester Stallone in the 90s. It's not a complete disaster of a film, but it's surprisingly flat, carries a lot of 90s cheese, and has a shocking amount of Rob Schneider in it. It never turned into the franchise that the studio wanted, so the property disappeared from the cineplexes.More than a decade later, DNA Films got the rights to the property and hired Alex Garland, the screenwriter for 28 Days Later, to write the screenplay. Karl Urban, the star of the film, has gone on to say that Garland actually directed the movie instead of the credited director, Pete Travis, although my guess is that Garland and Travis split the duties a bit (ala George Miller and George Ogilvie on Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome). Garland apparently went through a few ideas ranging from deep dives into the mythology of the character to what we finally got: a project of modest scope that leaves out a lot of the larger world building stuff that many comic book fans surely wanted to see.What we, the audience, received from Garland's work, was one of the most rewatchable, enjoyable, and effective action movies of the last couple of decades. And no one went to see it in theaters. Including me.World Building, or Its Near Total AbsenceOne of the things that I think makes the movie work so well is its narrow scope. The comic has been around since the 80s and, like most comic books, has developed a rather large bevy of characters to go along with the intricate history of the universe. Garland eschewed all of that, focused almost solely on the central character, Judge Dredd. We don't get long explanations of how the world dominated by Mega Cities came about. They are simply there. We don't get intricate discussions of the machinations of the police state. It just simply is in control. The movie establishes all that the audience needs to understand about the world (the Mega Cities, the Judges, crime, chaos) in the opening three minutes or so with a voiceover and montage. Essentially, it's the film saying, ""Here's the universe this story takes place in. You can accept it or not, but now let's actually get to the story.""In a movie world where everything remotely close to franchise worthy is trying to lay groundwork for sequels, this is extremely refreshing. I think of The Mummy, the confused and nearly unwatchable Tom Cruise vehicle from last year that spent a solid half of its running time trying to establish the Dark Universe for Universal. Dredd, by sidestepping world-building, gets to spend more time with its characters, plot, style, and theme (the four major elements of narrative) than with stuff that isn't nearly as important to the story at hand.Basic PlotFor those who haven't seen the film, or may have forgotten it, here's the basic plot outline of the film:In Mega City One, a new drug is hitting the streets called Slo-Mo. The manufacturer of the drug, a kingpin named MaMa, publicly executes three rogue dealers in her Mega Block, drawing the attention of Judge Dredd and his trainee Anderson. Once inside, the two judges get trapped and have to fight their way up the two-hundred story structure to confront MaMa, reclaim their freedom, and deliver justice.It's extremely similar to The Raid: Redemption, which has led to some accusations of plagiarism from some fans of The Raid, but Dredd was in production almost a year before The Raid first hit theaters.A Triumph of CharacterWhen most people think of Dredd, I doubt that they think of the film as some great achievement in creating characters. It's all about the exploding heads and weird slow-motion effects, right? Well, the movie's secret is that the violence carries weight because there's very solid character work going into it. It's not that the characters all go through massive changes. In fact, they largely stay the same through it all, but they are so well defined that when they get thrown together, the way they react to each other is what drives the action and makes it compelling.I see that there are three characters that are the most prominent in the film: Dredd, Anderson, and MaMa.DreddDredd himself is shockingly interesting considering the fact that he scowls all the time and we never even see his full face. His first scene is a chase and action sequence where we watch him apply the law in his status as a judge in this dystopian vision. He requires no backup. He pursues his objectives coolly but is unafraid of appropriately raising the stakes when the situation calls for it. He's completely no-nonsense and hardened, efficiently issuing out judgment. He's also willing to end a live in the name of justice. That's the groundwork that leads to everything that comes afterwards.The adventure that Dredd finds himself in takes him through Hell, testing him in every way. Physically, he's beaten down. He's challenged by an army of criminals, turncoat judges, and even his own partner (in a different manner than the others). What we watch is this clearly defined personality navigate the challenges he faces, and since he's so well-drawn as a character, there's a surprising amount of interest generated by him.AndersonJudge Anderson is a trainee who marginally failed her exams to join the force, but has strong psychic powers that allow her to read minds. Because the Judges are losing the battle for the city against the gangs, the Chief Judge assigns her to Dredd to see if her psychic powers add enough to the mix in the field to counteract her marginal fail.Anderson is a polar opposite to Dredd in every way. She's short where he's tall. She's skinny where he's broad. We never see his face, but she only wears her mask once, instead sporting a shocking sprout of blonde hair that contrasts starkly with her black and red uniform. She's also brand new where he's a long-time veteran of the force. The way the two of them play off of each other is great.At the beginning, Anderson largely follows Dredd. He points, she goes. He asks a question, she answers. He demands a judgment, she provides it. It's very much a mentor-mentee relationship at the start, but the desperation of their overall situation (their fight ever-upwards) creates situations where Anderson's psychic ability and her slightly more lax attitude to the application of the law (only in specific circumstances) actually helps the pair to win. Dredd begins the film thinking little of her (""It's not marginal. She failed,"" he explains to the Chief Judge) to finding her worthy of the badge (""She's a pass."").MaMaI'm not the biggest Lena Headey fan, but I absolutely love her as MaMa, the former prostitute who unmanned her pimp, took over his organization, and became so ruthlessly violent that she was able to completely take over Peach Trees, the Mega Block of tens of thousands of people. She plays MaMa really quietly. When she's really angry, her voice rises to a normal level, but most of the time she speaks almost in whispers. And yet, the look in her eye when she wants to do violence is really strong.There's a minor character played by Domhnall Gleeson (above) who runs her tech operation. When he first shuts the block down from the outside world, he's speaking over the phone to someone outside the block, trying to convince them to initiate the lockdown. All the time, MaMa sits quietly in the background, her facial scars red on her face, and her gaze locked coldly onto him. Since she's not actually the focus of the action, her presence is a little easy to miss, but once you see her there, you know that if he screws up and doesn't deliver, she's going to gut him.So, we have this hard as nails (but quiet as a mouse) woman/drug lord who had the misfortune of getting the attention of Judge Dredd with her public execution (with seventeen thousand violent crimes reported every day, Judges respond to four percent total) trying to manage the situation she created. Her penchant for violence comes to the fore early and often as she skins people alive and threatens the lives of every person and the next generation of their family for helping the Judges. When Dredd and MaMa finally face each other at the end, it's obvious that neither will budge. The movie doesn't end with the bad guy dying because that's how action movies end, it ends with Dredd killing MaMa because their personalities and situations are so diametrically opposed to each other that neither can exist at the same time.VisualsSo, that's not why most people say that they love Dredd. They love it for the action. And the action is really good. What gives the action weight is the character stuff accounted for above, but what gives the action its awesomeness are the use of visuals. The most obvious of these is the Slo-Mo effect. It's not just slow-motion, but extremely slow with a bright, glittery effect that sells the idea that this drug is quite the trip. Seeing bullets tear through bodies with the effects going is really quite striking. Here, have a look!
That leads me to mention how bright and colorful the film can be. As an audience, we're used to post-apocalyptic visions of the future turn dour and de-saturated, like every action movie about a dystopia carries the same thematic and intellectual weight as 1984. This isn't a dig on Dredd, but the fact that Garland and Travis weren't afraid of using splashes of color all over the place to help fill the world makes the film simply more interested to simply look at. From the bright reds of gunfire, to the multi-colored ads and computer screens, to the deep blues and greens of the medical bay, and to the neon colors of the smoke Dredd uses to cover his movements, all give the audience just that much more to look at in every moment. Bright colors in a future setting don't do everything (just watch The Zero Theorem to dispel yourself of that notion), but it certain",Dredd
80,TheOneThatYouWanted,Not bad.,7,11 April 2016,"This is my second time watching Dredd. The first time was back when it came out on the big screen. When I first saw it, I honest disappointed because I saw a movie not too many people knew about back then, The Raid about a few months before or so. They more or less have the same plot, but The Raid did it much, much better. Anyway, fast forward to my second viewing many years later, I like it. It is better than I remember and entertaining. Only if it had better marketing and didn't come out around the same time as The Raid. There is a lot of Dredd in this movie but not enough of what I'm going to call Dreddism. Dredd was almost like a background character in his own movie. Not until the very end did we get to see Dredd fully come alive. Another complaint I have is that the movie is too clean. Mega City looks clean, the dirty bad guys look clean. I think this is because this was a low budget movie as far as hero films go but still, it was noticeable. Anyway, the action is good. The acting is outstanding and the story was good enough. More than worth a watch.",Dredd
81,RatedVforVinny,Just an incredible achievement.,8,26 September 2019,"'Dredd' surprisingly is one brilliant Sci-fi movie and at last the comic book anti-hero that has been loved for decades (by many comic book fans), has been done justice (excuse the pun). Forget the previous Stalone debacle, this is the real deal and delivers no less, than complete satisfaction. A great movie on all levels (action/acting) and for once i'd love to see the same director produce another of the same ilk. But to this date still waiting for this ground-breaking sequel. There is no further recommendation needed, than 2000AD fans loved it!",Dredd
82,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Far more entertaining than Stallone's version,9,21 September 2012,"Deciding how a comic book character should be performed on screen can be a difficult task. Then comes the story; how should it involve its main character? In Sylvester Stallone's adaptation of Judge Dredd, his role was interested in the background aspect of the character and how he dealt with that situation. But for some protagonists, the background is not needed or shouldn't be explored. That is unless it's done in a fulfilling way. This version of Judge Dredd fully embraces it's combatant with open arms and displays to its audience what the world of Judge Dredd is truly like.To start off, the atmosphere of this dystopian America is much darker and grittier than that of the 1995 film. Perhaps that's what makes just the introduction itself so different than that of its predecessor. And to boot, various other elements have been changed. Things seem slimmer. The bikes the judges ride don't look like Honda Goldwings. The suits they wear are not big and bulky with enormous metal badges. Even from looking down at the city from a bird's eye view seemed rather spaced out. I criticized this in Stallone's film for feeling that everything seemed cramped, like it was all put in there at the last minute. But it's not like it here and that's good.Now, turning towards Dredd, I felt that Karl Urban played Dredd with high accuracy and precision. When no music was playing, just hearing his leather suit squeaking in the corridors gave me the chills. I would hate to be caught by him in that universe! Making him look even more hard- boiled was that Urban gave Dredd a five o'clock shadow. It's a nice touch actually. It makes the character of Dredd that much more believable as a soldier. Also staying close to it's comic book origins, the film crew decided not to reveal the look of Dredd under his helmet. Another brilliant choice because it creates a sense of perplexity about him as an individual. It's the same thing that was used for Darth Vader in Lucas' first three Star Wars films.And although Urban played Dredd with rather no emotion at all it was because of how he embraced the character that made it entertaining. Stallone, how would you say, messed with the recipe. He wanted to explore Dredd's backgrounds and made him transparent and uninteresting. I also stated in my review of Stallone's version that I enjoyed Rob Schnieder's character more than I did Stallone's. That's because Schnieder had funnier lines and had some sort of dimension. In this alternate film, Urban gives Dredd a lot of good lines. And if the main character is giving better lines than the side characters, that's one step closer to making a better film.As for female characters go, Olivia Thirlby is not only very attractive here but she's also quite fun to see her character learn from Dredd. Seeing her have her way with a baddie is quite satisfying too. Lena Heady, who is more known for playing Sarah Connor in Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles (2008), also gives a good performance. Her portrayal of a violently psychotic ex-prostitute was not only disturbing, but also rather enthralling to how bad she could actually be. As for action, there's not much to be said. There's plenty of it and the gore is happily appealing.My only complaints are of two things: the music and a subplot left unchecked. The subplot left unchecked was about a few characters that had an inside job and this inside job was never given a full explanation of how they snuck under the radar. That got to me a little bit. But oh well, it didn't matter in the end anyway. Music-wise, Paul Leonard- Morgan does create some nice tunes but a lot it is done in a way that doesn't sound engaging enough for an action film. I wanted to hear more but all I got was a bunch of electronic beats. Like can't there be a main theme? Music is important when it comes to film and that was an up- setter. However, overall, this is by far much better than the first Judge Dredd.The reboot of Dredd is intense and far more rich in atmosphere than that of the 1995 movie. Its music is at par level but is overshadowed by Urban's performance as the futuristic cop/judge.",Dredd
83,p-stepien,Judgement is final!,6,20 December 2012,"In the world of 2000 A.D. the world is a radioactive waste land laid in ruins by nuclear warfare. What is left of civilisation has formed a massive habitat Mega City One spanning almost the entire East Coast of North America. Within this vast metropolis law and order has lost to brutal criminal syndicates. With little options left a new type of police is formed - the Judges, a group of privileged individuals with access to high-tech weaponry and with the power to be judge, jury and executioner. Amongs them Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is the ultimate symbol, deadly, just and incorruptible. As the moral backbone of the organisation Dredd is given the task to assess a rookie Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), who failed to pass aptitude tests, but has been given a chance due to her incomparable psychic abilities. The first call has them venture into Peach Trees, a 200-storey vertical slums area, which is home to the Ma-Ma gang, led by deformed ex-prostitute Madeleine Madrigal (Lena Headey), and production epicentre for the Slow-Mo drug. When entering this self-governed community and apprehended a suspect the duo suddenly find themselves locked down within the complex - with Ma-Ma announcing that the Judges must be killed or else...Urban makes for a great Dredd, albeit one that has surprisingly similar facial expressions to his predecessor behind the mask Stallone. A far cry from the comiccy and somewhat ridiculed 1995 version this time around the 2000 A.D. is dark, gritty and unrelenting. With his gruff voice and threatening demeanou Judge Dredd is exactly what he should be, and the R-ratings exactly what the doctor ordered. Also instead of treading down a path of a complex storyline Dredd is initiated by a one-day-storyline, which allows to introduce the world and characters, thus avoiding the overreach, which hampered the 1995 venture. Nonetheless the success of the reboot is only partial as ""Dredd 3D"" comes undone from a somewhat surprising direction. Owed partially to a simplistic, albeit not banal and even somewhat ingenious plot line, ""Dredd 3D"" fails to withstand the comparison with the sleeper hit from Indonesia ""The Raid"", which follows the exact same premise (minus the hi-tech and futuristic setting). Despite the brutality and evident budget superiority the no-holds-barred approach of the Indonesian counterpart outdoes ""Dredd 3D"" in almost every regard - action, fight scenes, dramaturgy, tension and even gore. That left the viewing of ""Dredd 3D"" feel like retreading a somewhat inferior remake of the Asian martial arts power-punch (even more so with the somewhat anti-climatic resolution). Additionally the dark atmosphere sometimes makes the movie drop into an uninteresting greyness, which causes occasional lapses in viewing pleasures.",Dredd
84,Rob_Taylor,"Ironically, a movie about substance abuse that has so little substance of its own.",6,26 December 2012,"Dredd is really not very good. It relies entirely on 3d, CGI effects and explosions and gruesome death scenes for its attraction.The plot is lifted entirely from ""Raid - Redemption"" and Mega-City One looks like some kind of pathetic slum town. For a FUTURE dystopian society, I don't expect to see people driving around in easily identifiably modern vehicles. I also don't expect, in this future, to see villains dressing like henchmen from any drug-related contemporary movie of our time.If you happened to look in on a scene NOT involving the two main characters, then you could quite easily believe you'd wandered into a n episode of Miami Vice.The problem is that not enough imagination went into the writing. The plot is stolen, the sets are just old buildings, the vehicles are modern ones, the bad guys look like any drug gang you've ever seen on film and the Judges themselves look kinda wimpy.Everything looks kind of... modern day. There's very little in the way of futuristic tech, no scenes that make you go ""Wow!"". All that has been deemed unnecessary in the drive to make what is essentially a not terribly interesting action movie with excessively gratuitous violence.Whilst I'm on about violence, what the hell is with this? I don't mind violence. I even found some of the scenes in Dredd to be done rather well, in slow motion. But the thing that stood out for me was when Anderson's character has a mental battle with one of the drug gang's lieutenants. There are hints what he imagines doing to her but it is all rather weak and suggestive, rather than explicit.Considering how much effort went into displaying the violence on screen, the terribly obvious ""We mustn't show boobies!"" attitude towards sexual violence was almost laughable in this instance. The film had an R rating anyway, so why not push the envelope a little? Oh wait, I know why. Violence = good. Sex = bad. At least in any movie that comes out of Hollywood.In any case, Dredd was underwhelming. The entire plot could have played out as an episode of Miami Vice. They could have done so much more with more capable writers. Karl Urban does his best to act with just his mouth on display, but he looks uniformly miserable throughout. Olivia Thirlby conveniently forgets her helmet (read: A movie with two helmeted characters in would be nearly unworkable) and goes through the whole film not wearing it.I like Karl Urban, but he doesn't have the screen presence necessary to pull off this role. He tries his best, but he doesn't make it. If there had been more to his character - oh wait, there was a hint of that near the start that they managed to entirely forget about during the gun-fest - then he might have made something of the part. As it is, Dredd comes across as very one dimensional, and in a 3D movie, that ain't good.SUMMARY: All in all, a poor effort. Sets are poor, costumes are weak, plot is thin to the point of anorexia and violence is extreme. You don't need a brain to enjoy this. In fact, having one is a positive liability here. Stick to the old Stallone version. At least they tried to make it look like the future!",Dredd
85,brando647,Bloody and Unforgiving; DREDD is one of 2012's Best Action Movies,9,19 March 2013,"I am so glad this movie found some love once it hit home video. I was worried that it's poor box office returns might guarantee the end of what could be one of the best potential action/sci-fi/comic franchises. But now, there's still hope. DREDD was criminally under- recognized when it finally made it to theaters, making back only a quarter of its budget before being booted from screens. I've never read the 2000 A.D. comics from which Judge Dredd was spawned but I've always had a passing interest in the character and the world he inhabits. I've read a bit about it all online but, wisely, passed on the 1995 version starring Sylvester Stallone. When the character made his return to the big screen with DREDD, I knew better than to pass on it and the positive early buzz only made me that much more excited. The hype paid off with a killer action film that easily cracks my top ten films of 2012. Judge Dredd is an agent of law enforcement in Mega City One, a post-apocalyptic dystopia when millions of America's remaining inhabitants are crammed within it protective walls. Crime is rampant and the city's Judges are its protectors. Given the power of judge, jury, and executioner, it is the Judges' duty to dispense justice and rid Mega City One of its worst. As the movie opens, Dredd is assigned a rookie officer, Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), to assess in the course of their daily rounds. Not your average Judge fare, she was progressed through the program because her mutant psychic abilities might be of use. Her first mission under the guidance of Dredd: a call from the Peach Trees mega-block regarding three murders. Unfortunately for Dredd and Anderson, Peach Trees is under the rule of drug lord Ma-Ma and they've wandered into a death trap when Ma-Ma puts the block on lockdown, demanding her minions eliminate the Judges.DREDD is unapologetically awesome; a full-on, no-holds barred action film that refuses to pull its punches to cater to the PG-13 crowd. For that alone, it earns my respect. The violence here is brutal and graphic. Bullet hits are bloody, bodies are dropped from immense heights to splatter at the bottom, and people are eviscerated. Ideally, I would've loved for much the violence to be done practically because squibs will hurt more to watch than CG blood any day but I suppose it was probably cheaper to patch a lot of the bloody bullet strikes in digitally. It can be pretty glaring at times too, but I'm willing to forgive the movie and it's decision to go with quantity over quality. There is a lot of action here. From the time the movie opens on a drugged up car chase, the movie kicks into gear and never lets up. There wasn't a single point that I found myself bored. And Karl Urban perfectly embodies the role of Dredd. A man of few words and a permanent sneer, he's cold and calculating and has no problem executing criminals on the spot without so much as a flinch. It did take me a bit to acclimate to his costume, particularly the helmet. But the helmet is the character's defining feature and it didn't take long for the whole character to come together. Urban deserves the opportunity to make Judge Dredd his franchise and bring the character back for future films.Olivia Thirlby is Anderson, Dredd's recruit. Absolutely beautiful and seemingly fragile, she comes off as the last sort of person who should be tossed into an urban war zone. But Anderson is a psychic, a mutant from the outskirts of the city where the radiation from outside the walls gave her a power that the Judges believe might be useful in the field. Anderson is a perfect foil for the cold-hearted Dredd; she doesn't quite have the heart for bloody field executions and doesn't believe every encounter necessarily end in death. Dredd and Anderson's target at the top of Peach Trees megablock is a former prostitute turned drug lord, Ma-Ma. Ma-Ma is played by the beautiful Lena Headey, though you would barely recognize her through the scarred, meth-head style of her character. She can do deranged sociopath surprisingly well and Ma-Ma makes for a pretty cool villain. DREDD is a remake that no one was really waiting for but, now that it's here and it's been done so well, I know I'm hoping the series continues. DREDD is one of the best action movies of the year; I love it's full-blown violence and the gritty future it's set in. My fingers are crossed that we get further chances to dive into the dregs Mega City One with Judge Dredd.",Dredd
86,begob,Almost perfect,8,3 September 2014,"Relentless action - only two pauses, when Dredd meets his rookie and when Dredd leaves his rookie. Everything else powers on to the final showdown.It's kind of Clint Eastwood meets Resident Evil (including music), with a strong-jawed goodie and his sensitive sidekick battling through a confined environment to take on the evil.I was hoping for some reflection on the totalitarian nature of the society. There was a hint of the callousness, when a shopping PA system announces the dining area will re-open in an hour after a brutal shoot out. But you have to wait for an hour before the corruption shows up. So they can do more with the philosophy in future episodes.The actress is a honey - thankfully she throws her helmet away because it interferes with her psychic ability.Finally you have to wonder - if narcotics were legalised would all this violence be necessary?",Dredd
87,moviexclusive,"Grim, intense and delightfully violent, this Dredd reboot goes back to the hard-hitting roots of the comic and delivers an adrenaline-pumping experience fanboys will enjoy",7,18 September 2012,"Comparisons with perhaps this year's best martial arts film 'The Raid: Redemption' are inevitable, given how both movies employ essentially a 'Die Hard' premise to deliver relentlessly brutal action. But despite the similarities, this big-screen reboot of the cult 2000AD comic book icon is every bit as solid a B-action movie as 'Raid' – grim, intense and most importantly, delightfully violent. And yes, if you have to know, it erases all nightmares of Sylvester Stallone and Rob Schneider from our minds.Adapting John Wagner's creation is no easy feat, given Dredd's personality as a dour, laconic, and uncompromising upholder of justice. Yet screenwriter Alex Garland (best known for'28 Days Later') accomplishes the unlikely task of making Dredd engaging – and that is even without Dredd removing his signature helmet. Instead, his Dredd is unexpectedly appealing thanks to some blunt charisma and a dash of deadpan humour, without ever tipping into camp or caricature.The opening sequence where Dredd is seen on his motorbike pursuing a trio of wanted criminals on the run, simultaneously on a drug called Slo-Mo which makes the brain think that time is moving at one per cent its normal speed, establishes unequivocally the Dredd of this adaptation. Fully embracing his role as judge, jury and executioner, Dredd shoots an incendiary flare into a baddie's mouth just five minutes into the film, causing him to combust from within.And the good news for fanboys is – that's just the tip of the iceberg compared to the mega-violence that Garland and director Pete Travis have lined up. Applying a veteran-rookie setup, Dredd is immediately paired with the psychic newbie Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirby) – though the former is none too impressed by her underachievement at the Academy. Both are unwittingly thrust into the field when called to investigate a triple homicide in a 200-storey high-rise slum called Peachtrees, where all manner of lowlifes reside.Their opponent is the ruthless drug lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey), a former prostitute with a sadistic streak that now owns the entire Peachtrees property and runs her narcotics dealings from it. Afraid that Dredd's capture of one of her henchmen might lead to unwanted attention from the authorities, she orders Dredd and Anderson dead. The ensuing war is pure carnage – numerous heads smashed, countless bullets fired and an entire floor of the building levelled by an almost unrelenting stream of gunfire for five minutes – and Paul Leonard-Morgan's throbbing bass score makes the destruction even cooler.By now, you can see why 'Dredd' was branded a futuristic copy of 'The Raid' – though the subsequent dismissal by some was rather unfair in our opinion. Despite the structural similarities in both stories – including the chief villain's use of a building-wide intercom –the phenomenon is really mere coincidence. For one, while 'Raid' opted for an ultra- realistic tone to its violence, Travis and his British cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle (who also worked on Danny Boyle's 'Slumdog Millionnaire') goes for a more stylistic approach, exploiting the powers of the narcotic drug to create dreamy hallucinatory sequences punctuated by slo-mo shots of bullets ripping through flesh - which when viewed in 3D makes it even more dazzling.Garland's pairing of Dredd and Anderson also proves different from the sibling duo in 'Raid' – while Dredd remains from start to finish a man of few words not unlike what a 'Dirty Harry' of the future would be, Anderson is shown wrestling between the cold-hearted justice required of her profession and the compassionate empathy needed for her psychic gift. Though not played up, it's clear that both the impartial Dredd and the merciful Anderson actually complement each other – and the ending is a particularly sweet reminder of that dynamic.As Dredd and Anderson respectively, Karl Urban and Olivia Thirby are nicely matched. Urban goes for a minimalist portrayal, staying grim and appropriately badass all the way as the upright law enforcer. Thirby brings as much heart into the movie as she can, but a nice touch is when her Anderson reveals herself to have just as much inside her to take out the bad guys one by one. Headey is suitably diabolical as Ma-Ma, and together the triumvirate of Urban, Thirby and Headey pretty much carry the entire movie through its brisk duration.And within that one half hours, 'Dredd' essentially delivers what the fanboys have been looking for in a big-screen incarnation of their beloved character. Indeed, this Dredd is as much removed from the campy cartoonish Stallone version as can be – terse, tough and no-nonsense like how the books have made him out to be. It is also just as graphically violent, perhaps even more enhanced in 3D, so if you're one of the squeamish ones, then you're probably better off checking out the 1995 dud. For everyone else, this delivers the hard-hitting goods as it promises, the effect of which on your mind and heart is ironically just the opposite to that of the drug Slo-Mo in the movie.",Dredd

90,valadas,Two unequal parts,5,3 October 2012,"This is a stunning story that takes place in the futurist Mega City One a huge city that goes from Washington to Boston in an America devastated by nuclear war, a city closed within walls to avoid the radiation that comes from the surrounding ground. In this city the criminal gangs make the law and run an enormous drug trafficking. The only force that fights them is a body of policemen curiously called The Judges because they have got the legal power of arresting criminals and of accusing, trying, sentencing and executing them, everything on the spot and after the arrest mainly when they are caught red-handed. The whole story practically takes place in a huge tower inhabited by common families but where also a powerful gang led by Ma-Ma a tough and cruel ex-prostitute (a role admirably done by Lena Heady) has its headquarters. Two Judges (one of them a recruit one, a girl who has psychic extrasensory and medium powers) go there to arrest a few murderers and become the object of an organized attack by the gang which develops itself in amazing and terrible scenes of unprecedented violence. This movie could be one of the best of its kind if it could have kept the originality and inventiveness of the first part along the second one. But after having shown great visual quality and impact in the first half and also a remarkable introduction of characters and an original scheme of the action location and the plot itself, swerves into a succession of shooting galore not very brilliant and somewhat boring till the end.

After the 90's interpretation of the material, one of the worst films of all time and than the trailers and TV spots which just made it all seem unintentionally funny I just had no interest. But with all the great reviews and recommendations from people I decided to give it a chance. Well I'm disappointed... In myself. For not seeing this in 3D in theaters in must have been an amazing experience and for not supporting it at the box office because I defiantly want to see sequels. I'm not well versed in the material so I'm not sure how it measures up but this is a bleak, brutal, ultra stylish , kick ass sci-fi action movie. Set in the future when our police force consists of Judges. Like cops they answer calls and on the spot make their determination on your sentencing. Called to a very bad part of town a rookie and Judge Dredd find themselves under attack from the city's biggest crime boss as they are caged in a concealed mega structure. What could have come across as a cheesy excursion into silliness instead beefs up the plotting with so many cool things. for instance the rookie is a psychic and uses her gift in the most creative ways, The movie expertly avoids clichés as it explodes through the generic into something fresh and original. Exciting action sequences aside the film takes a moment so that you feel something for the two leads and some of the victims as well. The director executes the material cleverly in combining the films narrative and entertainment value beautifully. Some light pacing issues and a mediocre villain performance from Lena Headey aside this film sets a benchmark for it's genre and stands as one of the best of 2012 and most of the most exciting thrill rides ever made. 4.5/5",Dredd
94,Screen_Blitz,"Bloody, gun-blazing dystopian actioner is nothing extraordinary, but it is wildly entertaining",7,5 May 2017,"In a world dominated by comic-book entries based on Marvel Comics and the DC Universe, this action offers a take on a perhaps lesser known comic-book series, and that is the 'Judge Dredd'. Marking the second adaptation after the first critically-panned endeavor with Sylvestor Stallone in the title role, this film boasts Karl Urban as the titular costume crusader facing off the bad guys in a violent, blood-gushing showdown slapped with a fresh visual flair and adrenaline-fueled action scenes that rarely disappoint. By no means is this film a game- changer, nor does master with any compelling ideas revolving around the dystopian themes. While it excels in the visual department, the characterization perhaps could use more than an ounce of improvement. But for those who pursuing a basic popcorn flick with little more to root for than the lead character seeking justice in a crime-ridden wasteland, this one certainly delivers. Directed by Pete Travis, this film is set in the near-future where the crime has risen an all-time high and the law enforcement is now permitted as ""judge, jury, and executioner"". Costume-suited Judge Dredd (played by Karl Urban) and his naive trainee with psychic abilities Cassandra Anderson (played by Olivia Thirlby) are assigned on a mission inside a high-rise building where vicious drug dealer Ma-Ma (played by Lena Headly) is running a drug trafficking ring for a mind-altering substance known as 'Slo-Mo'. It is action-packed, it is visually stunning, and it meets just about everything in the criteria for a solid action thrill ride. As it is based on a series of comic books and follows a man seeking for justice against the gang of law-breaking minions, it does fall in the category of a superhero flick. Unlike most superheroes, Judge Dredd is the your average-guy who holds back from violent action when capturing his enemies. As the story is set in a dystopian society, he along his trainee exercise their authority to execute their enemies in a brutal fashion. That is where the action comes in. This movie sets the character on a long stretch of action sequences that spew more than enough blood and gore set stone to its R-rating. With heads torn apart about bullets and bodies dismembered in a gruesome fashion, this scenes have more than a fair capacity to leave the sensitive moviegoers sick to their stomach. Nonetheless, these scenes are the primary source of excitement to handed here. If there is anything plagues these sequences, it would most certainly the overuse slow-motion CGI effects that paint the action more often than not. And if the visual style feels somewhat reminiscent (particularly in the mind-altering sequences), that is because the action is shot by Anthony Dod Mantle who complete the cinematography for Danny Boyle's 'Slumdog Millionaire'. As for the performance department, Karl Urban is fine in the role, but his performance is greatly limited to stoic dialogue with facial expressions are mostly obscured by his helmet that only shows his mouth and lower chin. Olivia Thirlby and Lena Headly are decent as well, the severe underdevelopment of the latter's villainous characters leads to a rather disappointing villain that falls short of memorability.Dredd is a bloody, brutal, yet visually captivating action thrill ride that captures just enough thrills and energy to sustain a spectacular, if not mind-blowing actioner. The film does shows some flaws in terms of its script and overuse slow-motion, it nonetheless delivers enough energy and spectacle to please the action junkies on more than one level. As a result, it is wildly entertaining.",Dredd
95,Troy_Campbell,Bloody excellent.,9,26 October 2012,"I've never read the comics, I've never seen Sly's Judge Dredd (although know about it all too well) and I didn't go into this reboot with overly high expectations. Well, I bloody loved it. The action is hard-hitting, the violence is gleefully over the top - and in large supply - and the slow motion moments are breathtaking; all of which form a wonderfully gruesome, high-octane concoction of adult blockbuster thrills. The storyline is simplistic without being lazy and the ostensible similarities to The Raid are forgotten within moments thanks to the relentless pace filmmaker Pete Travis maintains. The dirty set design and art direction enhance the grungy atmosphere superbly; it's clear from the very beginning that this universe - aka Mega City One - has an infestation of irredeemable filth, making the Judges' determination to clean it up even more compelling. As for the cast: Karl Urban's chin is awesomely epic and with the help of the rest of his body he swiftly dispels any memories of Stallone's helmet-removing version of the lawman, whilst Olivia Thirlby does a nice job in the less flashy role of rookie Judge Anderson and Lena Headey is bad-ass as villainess Ma-Ma. I'm now officially a Dredd fan.",Dredd

There is no place to mine metal and materials for concrete, yet there are all these huge buildings (to house 800 million people) made of metal and concrete. This is impossible.

97,Joxerlives,Like to see a fusion of this and Stallone's Dredd,7,12 September 2012,"Watched this last night and it was interesting although not terrific. More gritty and less futuristic than Stallone's Dredd, good for the former, not so good for the latter.Karl Urban is very good in the role although I think I might have preferred Michael Biehn. The rest of the cast are good especially Lena Headly who is mesmerisingly sexy even with her scars (and insanity). Mega-City One is much more realistic which is something of a shame, I'd have preferred it a little more sci-fi. It's interesting to see all the drones flying about which seemed science fiction in the late 70s but now is reality. Back then of course we all thought crime would rise uncontrollably in the decades to come as in 'Escape from New York' but actually it keeps going down and down which must be distressing for sci-fi writers. Interesting scene when Anderson is in Kay's head and she allows him to 'mentally undress her', in fact she willingly undresses herself and falls to her knees for him, it's all very sexy yet largely implied, not all Judges the chaste automatons we thought they might be. Terrific scene where Anderson and Dredd are aided by a civilian only for Anderson to realise her husband is the man she summarily executed minutes earlier (much truer to the comics than Stallone's Dredd). The scenes with the miniguns and Dredd taking revenge with his incendiary round are magnificent. Ma-ma's death scene is both horrible yet strangely beautiful. The plot twist with the corrupt judges was entirely unexpected, the corrupt Judge's speech to Dredd actually realistic as opposed to Dredd's hard bitten idealism. It's nice to see Anderson give some mercy to Ma-ma's tech guy, that the Judge's aren't just ultra-authoritarian robots. One thing I think they got wrong was Dredd's inner humanity. Without being able to see his thoughts as in the comic he comes across as far less human than we know him to be, he cares for people, loves Mega-City one and risks his life to protect both. He only stuns the gun-toting kids when he could legitimately have killed both to his benefit. A bit more humour from him (which he DOES have in the comics) and use of the typical Dredd language such as 'Stomm!' and 'Drokk!' would also be welcome. So, good stuff, I'd like to see a sequel.",Dredd
98,reddiemurf81,Why did this NOT get a sequel?!?,7,3 July 2020,"Karl Urban (imo) is Dredd. This is a 7.5, at least, imo.Judge Dredd gets teamed up with a rookie named Anderson. During their day together, Dredd will assess Anderson to determine whether she will become a Judge or not.
They get called to investigate a murder at a high rise called Peach Tree in Mega City One. Peach Tree is filled with gang violence and drugs, especially a new drug dubbed Slo Mo.
This new drug is manufactured and sold by the Ma Ma clan,, ruled over by the ruthless, former prostitute Ma Ma.Besides a great performance by Urban, Olivia Thirlby (Anderson) and Lena Headey (Ma Ma) both bring a lot to the screen in this action adaptation.So go watch it!!",Dredd
99,one9eighty,"Judging, jurying and executing other lame BS comic book films",9,12 February 2020,"A great film; and one that has surely reignited comic fans passion for the hard-faced lawman's return to the big screen, after Stallone's 90's limp version almost ruined everything. Karl Urban dons the law enforcement helmet and delivers a gritty performance which feels right - big credit go to him for wearing a helmet for nearly 100 minutes that obscure everything other than his mouth, but that IS Dredd. Urban manages to deliver a performance with very little development, hardly any emotion, and very little passion - but that IS Dredd!! Lena Headey is equally brilliant with her performance of Ma-Ma, prostitute turned drug lord. Olivia Thirlby, although only credited as 'also starring', could be argued to have a bigger role than both - the character development arc focusses on her - starting as a rookie with psychic powers as she goes about adapting to life as a judge and the decisions and actions that shape who she is and how she'll be in the future.Judge Dredd (Urban) and rookie recruit Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) are called to Peach Tree's - an 200+ story building. On realizing that the judge of all judges is knocking at the door of a building her crime empire controls and has investment within, Ma-Ma orders a lock-down. Judge Dredd and Anderson are forced to defend themselves and fight for their lives, while performing the job, against all the odds. To make matters worse Ma-Ma uses every trick in the book, including calling in help from frightened residents and corrupt judges on her payroll.Rather than feeling and looking like a comic book turned film this feels grittier and dirtier - it's more R-rated graphic novel brought to life. It's simple but has enough complexity to entertain; it has a linear plot, but still throws in twists, turns and cliff hangers. If ""Die Hard"" had a sci-fi theme, then this film wouldn't be too far off how it would look - and getting compared to that film has to be a compliment. Visually this film is amazing, from the characters and landscapes, to the effects of the ""Slo-Mo"" or the psychic mindscape - everything is on point! The writing seems tight and there aren't many throw away narrative sequences that acts as buffer of filler. The action is brilliant and the pace of the film is great - it's a constant chase, hide, hunt and fight - high octane thrill ride.This is a modern day cult classic which will (hopefully) receive a lot of praise - and despite being done on a relatively low budget, with very little hope of success, has delivered a highly impacting action film. There will be fans clamoring for a sequel - myself included, but I'd also be equally happy if a sequel doesn't and in case it doesn't live up to what I've seen in this film. Without a doubt, despite my apprehension to aware high ratings to the films I write about, this is close to the top of the pile, and a firm 9 out of 10.",Dredd
100,adamscastlevania2,The Dredd movie you've been waiting for,8,23 August 2014,"(75%) A movie worthy of the character, filled with action, and a surprising amount of quite brilliant visual effects that sadly hardly anyone went to see when it hit cinemas, which was partly the studios fault as they limited 2D screenings. And that's besides the fact that I thought it worked quite well as a 3D movie, better than many others anyway. Unlike most comic book movies this isn't 3 hours and 45 minutes long, the budget isn't $300 million, and this doesn't have a watered down PG-13 rating, which maybe explains why it lost money, but it's still a damn good action flick. It does have similarities with the Raid, and that's fine by me because the Raid was also one of the better movies of that year, so who cares? Urban makes for a great Dredd as he pouts his lips in almost comical fashion throughout, and Olivia Thirlby's rookie character thankfully isn't utterly useless, yet still very much a vulnerable person trapped within this futuristic crime-ridden hell-hole. There's an element of the first two Robocop movies, with the future drugs and the violent gangs, and maybe there isn't quite so much depth here, but this is still a simple, very entertaining 90 min B-movie that I hope gets a decent sequel because it deserves one.",Dredd
101,gilgongo1980,Excellent,9,29 April 2019,"Karl Urban played dredd very well (extremely cool).

103,Bob-45,"Best produced US action film since ""Crank""",8,20 January 2013,"""Dredd"" is a textbook example of the importance of visionary producers, as not one element of the production and post production does not enhance the plot and mood. The flawless use of ultra slow motion photography, color tint, art direction, set decoration, makeup, and costumes perfectly captures the mood. Expert editing and sound enhances the action and advances the story at a perfect pace. The only weak element is the script, as Judge Dredd misses two clear opportunity to replenish his dwindling supply of ammunition and a hostage situation involving Dredd's rookie partner, both of which are contrived simply for suspense.The plot is similar to ""The Raid: Redemption,"" in that Judge Dredd and his rookie partner must fight their way out of a multi-story building (in this case, a huge one), when the criminal organization controlling the building drafts the tenants to help kill Dredd and his partner or face lethal consequences.Casting is equally perfect, especially Karl Urban as Judge Dredd. Urban, whose helmeted face reveals only his mouth and chin, is remarkable at expressing his feelings using only the muscles in his mouth and chin, since neither his words nor his voice ever express anything but an unflinching dedication to his mission to dispense justice.The violence, sex, drug use and brief nudity in ""Dredd"" is just graphic enough and is as uncompromising as Judge Dredd's mission.As a writer, all I can say is that it would be a privilege to work with this production team and I hope I am some day given an opportunity to do so.I give ""Dredd"" an ""8"".",Dredd

It really captures a live action comic book well and has super high production values and a perfect atmosphere; however, I can see why it didn't succeed in theaters, because it really doesn't fit in neatly into any market. The story itself could easily be PG-13, but the extreme level of graphic violence, while it is well-done and seems appropriate, just blasts this thing out of any reasonable kid- friendly realm. I'm not really into comic book movies much, but this one just grabbed me at the start and never let go.

105,ivo-cobra8,The Best Comic Action Adaptation movie of the year! It's Judgment Time!,10,7 November 2015,"Dredd (2012 is one of the best science fiction action film adapted by comic book 2000 AD. It is one of my personal favorite movies. This is the character that kicks ass! This movie is so much better than original Stallone film. Stallone's Judge Dredd did not kicks ass, Karl Urban's Dredd did! I love this film to death I love it so much and it is better than Judge Dredd (1995) and it always will be! Dredd kills like 50 people in here, there are 100 of bodies everywhere I love this action film to death! Lena Headey is such a bad ass, I told you the woman can kick ass and she would kick Emilia Clarke's ass anytime. Lena was such a bad ass playing beautiful Sarah Connor in Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles TV Series (2008). This movie is a lot of fun. Ma-Ma is not the law... I am the law. Dredd was a better comic adaptation of not only the story of Mega City One but also of Judge Dredd the character. If you were left with a bad taste in your mouth from Judge Dredd 1995 movie then this is the perfect flavor. Tons of action and gore to keep any guy entertained and before you realize it you are at the end. A must see not only for Judge Dredd fans but action fans also. The darkness and violence of the movie is how its suppose to be and the action just keeps building up throughout the movie. Action is well paced and believable. Not a dull moment.It is very violent, which I enjoy, but others may find it too much. This film is such a bad ass, he shots a bullet to the guys face and it melts his face off, that's awesome!!! There's a lot of slow-motion in here, but let me tell you something: Slow-Motions in here works, there is the reason for the Slow-Motion okay. Soon as he kicks the door in and he starts shooting people and in slow-motion you can see the bullets cut in the people's up and that is great, awesome! Lena Headey plays a good ass villain, man you want to see her ass kicked! You want to see that Judge Dredd takes her up in the air, ""Your going down, your going down real good."" I love this movie I had a great time seen it, it is a solid Rater R reboot movie for an adults and not a children. You can see people cut in a half for a true 80's throwback kick ass Science Ficton/Action new wave classic I'm glad I enjoyed this film. It deserves much more respect than it garnered in the press and ticket sales. The acting is top-notch, a simple yet elegant plot device, and amazing cinematography. It may not have made a lot of money or been given the respect it deserves at this time, but I have a feeling that subsequent generations will find a hidden gem in this masterpiece. Personally I love Dredd, like any other comic character or real person witch stays true to his honor and values of life or society without making himself the exception of his own rules. That's true ideology. Any other thing is propaganda or personality problem. The world has irradiated itself from nuclear war. The earth is all but a barren wasteland, with its remaining inhabitants crowded into Mega-Cities. Mega-City One's population is 800 million, with its territory stretching from Boston to Washington D.C. Amongst the crowded chaos stands one force to bring order; a force that serves as jury, executioner, and Judge. On a day when Dredd (Karl Urban) is assigned rookie, Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), for assessment, they would get more than they bargained for on her first day. In response to an initial homicide call at the city block of Peach Trees, they also discover a drug ring run by a woman called Ma-Ma (Lena Heady). But she won't have the Judges taking one of her men into custody. And in an attempt to thwart them, she seals the block's blast doors, leaving the Judges to fend for themselves as they battle to survive. In the future, America is a dystopian wasteland. The latest scourge is Ma-Ma, a prostitute-turned-drug pusher with a dangerous new drug and aims to take over the city. The only possibility of stopping her is an elite group of urban police called Judges, who combine the duties of judge, jury and executioner to deliver a brutal brand of swift justice. But even the top-ranking Judge, Dredd (Karl Urban), discovers that taking down Ma-Ma isn't as easy as it seems in this explosive adaptation of the hugely popular comic series.That is your basic plot it is a lot of interesting titles that make this movie the bleak and desolate sci-fi actioner that it is. It is a dystopian Science Fiction action flick similar to Robocop (1987). This film works while Robocop (2014) reboot failed! Dredd is a 2012 science fiction action film directed by Pete Travis and written and produced by Alex Garland. It is based on the 2000 AD comic strip Judge Dredd and its eponymous character created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra. I am giving this film A 10/10 because it deserves it!

109,joebloggscity,Dredd reboot - as violent and as dryly humorous as you'd want,8,8 January 2013,"Forget the Stallone hash that was made all those years back. This is a complete reboot, and should be taken on its own. More faithful to the actual graphic novels & comics, this is a take that doesn't water down the graphic element of the original source material and in return we are taken on a roller coaster.Our hero ends up locked up with Judge Anderson (a rookie) in a 200 storey tower block run by gangster ""Mama"". It's a mad wild place and our heroes, dragging along their arrestee, are plotting to get out.For those au fait with the character, they will know his uncompromising attitude and darkly dry humour (a kind of futuristic Dirty Harry) and its been adapted to the film very well, being as faithful as possible. Judge Anderson is great here too, and Lena Headey as the big villain, is suitably brilliant as the beautiful mad leader of the house in this tower block from hell.Gripes? Some might see parts of it as too similar to other films, such as The Raid, but that's probably coincidence in that sense. Prince Charles Cinema (London) showed this film with The Raid & Robocop as a triple bill and it was excellent. You can enjoy them all.Could have had a lot more satire in it. One of the great aspects to the comics was the social satire, seemed to be lacking here.Maybe the lead actor wasn't perfect for the role. Did okay but seemed to not carry the weight of the voice, but you'll get used to it.A good violent film with a good graphic novel story.

110,jrarichards,"Nice dystopia, shame about the realisation...",4,30 June 2019,"I come to ""Dredd"" (from the British pairing of Alex Garland and Pete Davis) hardly versed at all in Judge Dredd ""lore""; and find it disappointingly in line with (limited) expectation that the film is premised primarily on squeezing as much graphic violence out of its 95 minutes as possible. Interestingly then, ""Dredd"" lacks the subtlety to even get much extra gore, cruelty or sadism out of its astronomical body count, merely being content to have characters blast(ed) away again and again and again and again. The law is being dispensed here by the titular character, who is actually played by Karl Urban, though it might as well have been me (I'm cheaper after all), since the face is never seen and no acting is involved here. (Almost) the same can be said of Olivia Thurlby as rookie Cassandra Anderson, but she is certainly a more sympathetic and nuanced character. On a good day, Lena Headey would have been quite capable of giving more to her villainous role, but in the event this too proves extremely one-dimensional.I watched primarily out of potential interest in the dystopian vision that lies at the heart of this imagined world. It's intriguing and at moments even interestingly or impressively portrayed, but far more inventiveness could have gone into even that, which is a shame given Garland's considerable capabilities in this area. The fusion of old and new tech that Dredd refers to at the start and end of the film has its fascinations, but since the Judges get the full benefit of the new (leaving them highly capable and almost indestructable), the logic of the dystopia is undermined when so much crime is still seen to flourish. Likewise, real-life crime groups as merciless as that of Headey's character ""Ma Ma"" do not last long as even cowed people simply will not tolerate the unending presence of grinding poverty, hardship, instability and terror. So it would prove here too, and all the more so given the toughness and resourcefulness of those apparently working in the service of law and order.It would be wrong to dismiss ""Dredd"" as a mess or even a Turkey, since it has its vision and its measure of cohesion, and is certainly made with some care and respect. But ultimately it all comes over as lowest-common-deniminator film-making neither innovative nor visually arresting nor witty enough to really make the grade.",Dredd

Like those other Japanese films, ""Dredd"" is relentless in its pursuit of blood and carnage. Generally, the acting was kind of so-so, but movies like these know they're not in contention for thespian Academy Awards.

112,Superunknovvn,"Old school, brutal action flick",7,25 November 2012,"It doesn't happen all too often anymore that I go to watch a movie without having checked its rating on IMDb before. With ""Dredd"" I thought I had checked the rating and that it was somewhere around 6.6. So when I went to the movies I pretty much expected this to be mildly entertaining, but utterly forgettable.The first ten minutes of ""Dredd"" did little to alter this expectation. The 3D is awfully done and distracting. We learn about a drug called Slow-Mo and its effects don't translate too well to the screen. Everything just happens really slowly (as you would expect) and that's it. It is as gripping as it sounds. A car chase comes and goes, and I was ready to be bored for the rest of the movie.However, as soon as Judge Dredd and his female co-star Anderson go to investigate three murders in an apartment building things pick up. The two Judges get locked in with thousands of thugs who want to kill them. To survive the two must fight their way to the top of the skyscraper and kill the Überboss (a somewhat underwhelming character played by Lena Headey).Anybody who has seen the Korean action film ""The Raid"" will be reminded of that movie's plot from here on in. The similarity is an unfortunate coincidence. Apparently ""Dredd""'s screenplay had been finished before that of ""The Raid"", but seeing how the American movie was released later, it unjustly seems like a rip off now. Also, most people seem to prefer ""The Raid"". Not me. I find the highly choreographed Korean movie tiring after 10 minutes, ""Dredd"", on the other hand, is entertaining and enjoyably old school in its ultra brutal depiction of violence.It's not a politically correct movie. In fact, its morals are downright rotten, but that's in the nature of the main character. I have never read the original comics (which is probably also why i didn't think the Sylvester Stallone movie from 1995 was all that horrible), but from what I've heard the movie is rather faithful to the spirit of its source material. If you find fault with it, you should blame the character's creators John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra, not the makers of this movie.""Dredd"" is the closest thing to an old school action flick, much ballsier and better than ""The Expendables"" and its sequel that tried to be the real deal. Unfortunately, audiences didn't requite the effort. That way ""Dredd"" will probably be a last reminder of a time when action movies actually seemed dangerous and forbidden.",Dredd
113,Movie-Misfit,"Stylish, Entertaining, and Total Dredd!",7,29 December 2014,"It took me a while to get watching this. I was put off by the fact that Karl Urban was the star and that it was pretty much a rip-off of The Raid just before its production.But eventually, I got there, and yes I thought it was fantastic!I enjoyed reading a lot of Dredd growing up, and more so Rouge Trooper and the ABC Warriors in editions of 2000AD.That is why the Stallone version of Dredd is a guilty pleasure of mine. I loved it, and thought Stallones voice was a lot more connected. But maybe I'm just used to that.I've never been a fan of Urban, but in this, I tried to get past that. He seems to have nailed the emotionless and fish faced Dredd to a tee, with certain expressions and comments that set me back in the pages.Visually the film was brilliant. The slow motion effect added a bit more excitement, with the violence and action never shying away from the camera!It hits hard with a number of cringe moments without being too much. Dredd seems to have worked, so here's hoping we see more from the same team in the near future.",Dredd
114,jessegehrig,I forgive you,7,7 September 2013,"Not a good movie. It is very watchable- I watch the sh*t out of Dredd. It gives me what I want. Gore, gun-violence, crappy dystopian overpopulated post-apocalyptic future. People are mutilated and dehumanized and I don't know what that says about me that I enjoy that, but you win some you lose some as I like to think. Want to get drunk or substance abuse, hey, this movie is perfect for those sad lonely hours, I mean, I'm certainly not going to judge anybody, you do what you gotta do to get through the night. I don't need to waste your time with the plot, its a Judge Dredd movie, figure it out for yourself. That this movie keeps it simple is what separates it from the Stallone Judge Dredd, I mean what the hell was Stallone thinking putting all that plot crap in his movie in the first place, point gun shoot cue blood pack squib- its an easy formula.",Dredd
115,ersinkdotcom,"""Dredd"" delivers a satisfying and uniquely stylish film adaptation of the classic comic book hero",8,9 January 2013,"Let's get one thing out of the way up front. The only thing 2012's ""Dredd"" and 1995's ""Judge Dredd"" have in common is a name. For those who have somehow escaped seeing a trailer for the new take on the futuristic lawman, let me just say there's no comparison between the two. Sylvester Stallone's adaptation of the character boasted stylish clothing, props, and special effects. Karl Urban's has style, but it's in the form of an interesting combination of artsy cinematography and violent grit.The America of the future has been reduced to a desolate wasteland known as the Cursed Earth. The only civilizations left are overcrowded metropolitan areas called Mega Cities. Inside each of their walls, hundreds of thousands of citizens fight for some semblance of a life amongst the decay and crime.The only thing standing in the way of the gangs and other lawbreakers taking over the cities are the Judges. They act as judge, jury, and executioner when they encounter ""Perps."" Joseph Dredd is the most notorious Judge in Mega City One. His skills are put to the ultimate test as he and his new partner, a psychic named Anderson, are commissioned to take down a drug kingpin housed atop a sealed-up tenement where everyone is on the hunt for them.Screenwriter Alex Garland and director Pete Travis did a bang-up (literally) job of delivering a satisfying vision of 2000AD's legendary comic book character. I don't think Dredd fans could have asked for more. All the graphic violence and cynicism readers came to enjoy on the printed page is brought to vivid life with plenty of splashes of bright red to quench the bloodthirsty hordes.I'm extremely impressed with director of photography Anthony Dodd Mantle's work. He creates a beautiful balance between gut-level grime, realism, and a hyper-colored drug-induced world of art house / indie film glitz. It's a unique mash-up that works effectively within the confines of ""Dredd.""Alex Garland's screenplay is simple and to the point while staying engrossing. Everything moves along quite well until the last ten or fifteen minutes. Unfortunately, we run into some action / cop movie clichés which don't completely ruin the experience but come dangerously close to tainting it. A simpler ending might have brought the film to a close quicker, but would have served it better in the long run.Longtime enthusiasts and action movie fans will delight in the gory ultra-violence of ""Dredd."" It delivers on every level and only meanders into overly familiar territory momentarily. Great cinematography and a simple-yet-satisfying story make this recommended viewing.http://contributor.yahoo.com/user/849014/eric_shirey.html",Dredd
116,Likes_Ninjas90,"It's a fascist movie, solely interested in seeing its tattooed, scar-riddled baddies mowed down, one level after another",3,21 October 2012,"In the future, a violent city known as 'Mega-City One' is in disarray due to the number of criminals and lowlifes that rule its streets. Combating their influence are the 'Judges', futuristic police who control crime faster by acting as the judge, jury and executioner at the scene of an incident. The best of these judges is Judge Dredd (Karl Urban), a super cop who never removes his helmet and isn't afraid to pull the trigger. Dredd is paired up with a rookie named Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), who wasn't able to pass her first test but is being considered as a Judge because she is actually a mutant with psychic powers. She can be used to anticipate what baddies are going to do or to steal important information from their minds. Together, Dredd and Anderson investigate a homicide case where some bodies have been thrown down from a tower block called Peach Trees. One of the first criminals the Judges pick up is Kay (Wood Harris) and they try escort him out of the building for interrogation. However, this is overseen by the crime boss Ma-Ma (Lena Headey), who opts to have the building locked down, trapping the Judges and Kay inside because she doesn't want her narcotics operation and her SLO-MO drugs uncovered. By using a variety of different weapons and gadgets, Dredd and Anderson work through the building to take down Ma-Ma and her heavily armed goons. Dredd (3D) lacks the sophistication to problematise the synonymous material of its comic book source, opting to be loud, ugly and super violent, without a definitive reason for its existence. It's a film that looks to extend upon Hollywood's plethora of comic book adaptations, the highly bankable but increasingly laboured subgenre, which presses the politically conservative view that one person can save the world. The very best comic book films though have also been forged with a moral compass, addressing ideas of justice and vigilantism (The Dark Knight, 2008), or appropriated to capture the euphoric personality and energy levels of various zany heroes (Iron Man, the Spider-Man films). Dredd, directed by Pete Travis, is the second attempt to adapt the character Judge Dredd from the 2000 AD comic book, and it's not only well short of the aforementioned movies but also the Sylvester Stallone misfire. The 1995 movie is not particularly impressive, and apparently, not entirely true to the comics either. But critically, it was willing to challenge the meaning of justice. Dredd was deeply inscribed in the law, until he was convicted of something he knew he didn't do. Does that mean the law can be wrong one percent of the time? Forwarding seventeen years later, and the same questions of authoritarianism and fascism are diluted by Dredd's reliance on special effects and shootouts. After a brief opening, the remainder of the film largely takes place in one setting for the entire movie. It's a very different look and feel to the original movie, highly atmospheric and gory, but not appropriate for younger children. The world, including this block, is defined by dark, gritty urban slums, where the effects of violence and drugs are publicly displayed. The corniness and cheese of the Stallone film is replaced by moroseness and nihilism so Dredd can posture as being mature or 'adult,' when really it isn't.The film's narrative is dully reduced to a series of gunfights, which means that there is no time spent on critiquing Dredd's methods of authority. He's a faceless, witless killing machine that spouts lines like ""She's guilty and we're Judges,"" and ""Its judgement time"". This is apparently what the character is like in the comics, as insipid as I found it, but the film doesn't make enough of a point of it. The comic's social criticism is deeply weakened by Travis's insistence on celebrating the violence so that the film becomes the very issue it's supposed to be addressing: it's a fascist movie, solely interested in seeing its tattooed, scar-riddled baddies mowed down, one level after another. Anderson is supposed to represent an alternate, pragmatic form of policing, which sees Dredd taser two young kids pointing guns instead of killing them, and her letting a computer whiz go after reading his mind to steal a code. But miniscule events like this have the impossible task of competing with huge set pieces that simply romanticise Dredd's brutality. The film's narcotics thread for example, exists only to justify the inclusion of gratuitous amounts of slow-motion effects. We have to endure close-ups of bullets breaking through the skin of a man's cheek or a baddie being thrown out of a window by Dredd, as they glide to their death. Is there any point other than to pander to the video game fans that might actually be too young to watch this anyway? As a character, Dredd has been compared to Dirty Harry Callahan. The difference is this though: the big guy fought against an unfair justice system that let guilty criminals walk free and his films didn't linger or glorify how he punished thugs. The Dredd in this version might say he is the law, but in the words of Dirty Harry himself: ""The law's crazy"".",Dredd

I was skeptical of the movie as most comic book movies are very hit and miss and being that 2000AD is a hyper violent comic series I didn't think they would do it justice I was very wrong.Dredd is an excellent film for both the old and new Judge Dredd fans. The Violence is kept high the visual style of the film is very colorful and dark at the same time. Karl Urban as Dredd is perfect casting Lena Headley as the Villain again amazing if you love a great movie high on violence, great visuals, acting and action watch Dredd comic book fan or not Dredd won't disappoint.",Dredd
118,anselmdaniel,Great action movie,8,18 May 2019,"This review contains spoilers.'Dredd is a 2012 science fiction action movie that is directed Pete Travis. The movie's screenplay is by Alex Garland and is based on the characters Judge Dredd created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra. The movie stars Karl Urban as Judge Dredd and Olivia Thirlby as Cassandra Anderson. Judge Dredd and his partner Anderson investigate an apartment tower and must stop a ruthless crime boss.At 95 minutes of running time, Dredd is a non-stop thrill ride. This movie has so many action scenes littered throughout. It made this movie incredibly enjoyable to watch. A great thing about all of these action scenes is that all of them felt distinct and interesting. For the most part Judge Dredd and the rookie Anderson are up against criminals. When the movie switches to them fighting against corrupt judges the action scenes have a different feel to them. It felt that the characters had to handle the situation with their intelligence rather than superior weaponry. The action scenes with the common criminals are also a treat to watch.Dredd is a movie that earns its 3D release. The 3D in this movie is absolutely impressive and shows the high quality of its visuals. I was impressed with how the slo-mo drug sequences worked and how colorful everything became. I liked the color usage in this movie as everything felt like a comic book and felt distinct. The action scenes especially had a good feel to them. The visuals made each action scene unique.The two leads of Karl Urban and Olivia Thirlby do an excellent job as Judge Dredd and Anderson. I believe this is the best portrayal of Dredd as Karl Urban captures the character incredibly. Dredd is intimidating, intelligent, and ruthless. Anderson plays a nice foil to Judge Dredd being a rookie in Mega City One. The two characters have good interplay as they play out action and drama scenes.The villain of Ma-ma played by Lena Headey does a good job. This gang boss is ruthless in her dealings with the tower of Peach Trees. It made the dynamic with her and Judge Dredd interesting to watch. Likewise all of Ma-ma's assistants felt distinct in some way.I would recommend 'Dredd.' This is a solid action movie.Grade: B",Dredd
119,ThurstonHunger,All Bang Bang...,4,16 October 2021,"Rented this after I learned that Alex Garland has written the screen play as I find his other work captivating and resonant with the risks of our society these days.The film seemingly exceeds the bullet count of Matrix Reloaded. Excessive violence does not deter nor delight me, and in an action film for a dystopian future, one has to expect it. I've not read the comic at all (which in a way is surprising) so I did not come in with any pre-determined and too high expectations.Designer drugs are a problem in our real world, but SLO-MO is a perfectly designed imaginary drug for the reel world. It does allow for excessive gore exploration, but it is oddly beautiful in that manner. The style of the film but in viewing and definitely sound worked well for me. Garish colors and digital snowflaking for either the sake of the drug or as part of the filth of the future certainly catches your eye, while the controlled noise soundtrack does the same for your ear.But ultimately the two-person shooter video game story (and elements of the old vet and the wet behind the flaxen blonde covered ears rookie don't really offer too much.) That blonded Olivia Thirlby is given a good reason to not wear the judicial executioners helmet, and that power of hers could have been used even more to flesh out the story.Well ""flesh"" out, that is the wrong word....plenty of flesh in here.My takeaway is that for Garland fans like myself, you could pretty easily pass on this. If you do watch it, I'd be curious if he is more reviled by emotions, than the horrors man can do to man. Or the horrors that cinema can reflect on the screen for us.I might be wrong about the distrust of humane emotions by Garland, and there is a scene of clemency for an eye-dilating hacker that Alex could point to as the center point of the film. I would disagree, but you be the judge.",Dredd
120,Laakbaar,Extremely violent but gripping,8,16 October 2012,"Dredd is set in a vast walled American mega-city in a radioactive, high-tech post-apocalyptic future. It is a grey, dreadful world devoid of nature, prosperity, beauty, reason, hope. Many of the 800 million people are crammed into monstrously large fortress-like residential towers. Law and order has almost completely collapsed, especially at Peach Trees, the tower where the vicious Ma-Ma Clan rules. Can Judge Dredd stop this menace and restore order? He is assisted by Anderson, a rookie judge whom he is assigned to evaluate. She has a special, useful power, but she is inexperienced, little more than a girl. Will she cut it? I dislike movies structured around violence, shoot outs, car chases and super-human fantasy characters. In this movie, we see all of this in the first five minutes. The violence and gore were extreme and completely gratuitous. Really, this movie is a paean to violence and gore. Be warned.Many of the premises, events and plot developments are not really logical or properly explained. None of it is realistic. It is not enough to merely suspend your disbelief; you'll have to take your disbelief, skin it alive, and push it over the railing of a skyscraper. I won't bore you with the details of the unrealistic aspects. Yes, I know it's based on a comic book.And yet I rather enjoyed this film. I can't really explain why, but it was gripping. I wish I knew more about movie-making to explain it. It was little more than 90 minutes of shooting, cruelty and extreme violence, something I would ordinarily hate in a movie. But it worked for me.None of it was believable, or particularly original, but I enjoyed Travis's rich vision of this horrible future world. It was similar enough to our world for the viewer to latch on. Travis might have to be a little careful in the sequel though, because at one point I started feeling that this entire society was beyond redemption. And a movie needs some kind of redeeming factor. There has to be some reason why we should care about this society enough to think that the violence is undeserved.The interplay between Dredd (Karl Urban) and Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) was minimal, but this was the heart of the movie, I suppose, and what made it also a film for grownups. Thirlby also played her action role well. I'm looking forward to seeing more of her in a sequel. All we saw of Urban was his jaw and mouth--but that was enough for Urban to convey some of the complicated aspects of his black-and-white character. Strangely, by the end of the movie I was desperate to see Dredd's face. The first thing I did when I got home was to google the actor.Dredd is the extreme archetype of a lawman (or any authority figure really): tough, relentless, authoritarian, robotic and ultimately quite insane. Anderson was the only real truly developed character in the movie. Without her, the movie would have been nothing. The original music by Paul Leonard-Morgan was fantastic in a sort of tribal, pounding kind of way. It helped make the movie what it was.I also enjoyed the glittering slo-mo effects. It was unexpectedly beautiful. A nice visual metaphor of what being high on slo-mo is like.I would go see this one.",Dredd
121,billygoat1071,Getting It Right,7,20 September 2012,"The first film adaptation of Judge Dredd is probably made for Sylvester Stallone's career, but it tones down the character by making him a generic hero with a wimpy sidekick and a love interest, fighting a bunch of hammy villains. Much worse is he mostly removes his helmet and shows his entire face which is a horrible sin to the character. This version, Dredd, is a lot darker and has more respect to the source material. The difference is it aims to be a Sci-Fi Noir Thriller than an Adventure Fantasy. Some might think it's just another action film, but it turns out to be one of the most intense action films of the year. Although, the plot isn't quite fresh. The film is still an entertaining ninety minute thrill ride.One thing you should know about Judge Dredd is he is not your average hero. Unlike most heroes, he's faceless, fearless, grim, lawful, and unsympathetic to his enemies. It's an intriguing comic book character that is worth rooting for. The story is straightforward. It doesn't explain anything about the ""Cursed Earth"" or the back story of the main protagonist. The intro briefly explains about the city but the rest is all about the mission. The main plot is quite similar to another action film, The Raid: Redemption. A band of law enforcers trapped inside an apartment building, ambushed by criminals who wanted to kill them. Except, the martial arts is replaced with a sense of Police Detective and Science Fiction with bigger and louder gunfights. That is the interesting part of the film. The plot may not be fresh all in all but the film is clever enough to put things together than just throw some random action set pieces.Karl Urban lives it up to the character. Besides of looking awesome with the helmet, he makes every scene excitingly fun. Olivia Thirlby plays her role pretty well as Dredd's rookie sidekick. Lena Heady is threatening enough as Ma-Ma. The action scenes are mostly gunfights. They are slick and intense. The opening chase scene was the craziest action of the film. The rest is quite stylish and explosive. The slow motion action scenes are pretty cool especially when there's blood and gore exploding on screen. It interestingly shows the overlong slow trippiness of the ""Slow-Mo"" drug. The production design and the special effects are solid. The music score adds the momentum of the action. I don't know what to say about the 3D.The plot is kind of weak but as a whole the film gets it right to its source material. Keeping Dredd's helmet on and setting it on a bleak grim world already makes this a worthy adaptation. I could've enjoyed it more if I saw the full version of the film. The version here in my country censors the best gore of the picture. It's still somewhat gory. The film has the tension and the style. Dredd leaves the generic hero arc behind and let the Judge do what he does best.",Dredd
122,bheadher,A poor imitation of a blockbuster from the 90's...,3,8 March 2021,"Ok ok, so Sylvester's wasn't exactly a blockbuster either...but at least it was fun to watch...This one is not fun to watch...in fact after about 5 minutes you feel like your gonads are in a vice and it's getting tighter by the minute...frankly I have no idea how this got an average rating in the 7's, because honestly it doesn't deserve that high a rating...really low budget too, apparently...",Dredd
123,TheSquiss,"Mildly entertaining, gratuitously violent and INCREDIBLY LOUD!",3,28 September 2012,"If I were a headline writer for a tabloid I might opt for the obvious pun to describe Dredd but it wouldn't be fair. The second film in my double bill was merely poor.My initial opinion, after watching the trailer some weeks ago, was that Dredd would be little more than a weak, pointless, sci-fi variation of The Raid, which was a virtually flawless film and a surprising gem. After the event, my opinion has changed. Slightly.Dredd and I didn't get off to a good start. I resent being forced into a 3D screening because there are no 2D screenings within a two-and-a-half hour drive. Avatar was made for 3D, TT3D: Close to the Edge benefited hugely and last year's Wimbledon men's final was a joy to watch with the extra dimension; not as good as being there but a heck of a lot better than on the TV. The difference is that these films, bar the odd cheesy moment in Avatar, used 3D to give greater depth and not to make the audience duck or squeal at yet another bullet/spear/nose looming towards them. 3D should not be about gimmickry. Alas, that's largely what Hollywood hurls at us with the additional dimension.In the case of Dredd, it frequently didn't work. The multitudinous shots of exploding glass were so soft they more closely resembled clumps of snowflakes and the entire experience was so juddery the magnificence of the digitally constructed set was frequently lost. But the real pain caused by Dredd was to the ears. IT'S JUST SO DAMN LOUD! What is it with action directors (yes, Pete Travis, I'm talking to you!) who think loud means powerful? Deafening explosions, effects, screams and even dialogue do not inspire or excite the audience. They just make our ears bleed. It didn't help that it was the same Cineworld screen and same issue as Monday's screening of Looper (Don't see anything in screen 7 at Cineworld Hengrove until they get their act together!) but perfect speakers would not have solved the issue created by Team Travis.There isn't a great deal of acting on show in Dredd. Karl Urban as the titular Judge is a vast improvement on Stallone, but the same is true of the entire film. He brings a certain gravitas to the role and, placed in the same world as him, you sure as hell wouldn't give him reason to walk towards you. Olivia Thirlby is also more than adequate as the rookie judge, Anderson, but there's nothing in her performance to get excited about. The showier role and the recipient of the best direction (snarl, pull the trigger and hang on until you run out of bullets) is Lena Heady as crime lord Ma-Ma. She has no redeeming features and you know she's one very bad mofo by the jagged scar that adorns her face.So, after all the whinging, what's Dredd about? Well, it's about 15 minutes too long and 40 decibels too loud but other than that, it's about violence in a dystopic world where the cops are judge, jury and executioner all under one helmet. It's all about violence; gratuitous violence. There are more corpses littering a certain tower block in Mega City One at the end of this film than in all the Rambo films combined. Probably. Not that that upset me. I can handle a good gunfight on screen if there's reason, creativity and entertainment involved. What bothers me more is that, in this 18 rated, adult-themed action flick, Travis very pointedly avoided showing a pair of naked tits lest it break the boundaries of decency but had no qualms in showing a head explode across a pavement in vivid, explicit, graphic, bloody slow motion.Well, at least I was protected from anything shocking.It was entertaining, other than the blood trickling down the side of my face, but is Dredd a weak, pointless, sci-fi variation of The Raid? In the future, a cop gets caught in tower block that's become a gang-ruled haven of crime and is locked down so that no-one gets in and no-one gets out until the cop is dead. Everyone with a gun, knife or stick is under orders to kill him and his companion by the big boss and some of the cops are bad guys. You tell me!",Dredd
124,grendelkhan,Excellent adaptation of the iconic comic.,8,10 December 2013,"Judge Dredd is an icon in the UK. It was born in the pages of the new comic magazine 2000 AD, in 1977. Creators John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra delivered something new to comics, especially to British comics. This wasn't the bright future of Dan Dare or a lighthearted tale from the Beano; this was the spirit of Punk brought to comics. Dredd is the ultimate in anarchic satire, hard-hitting action, and in- your-face graphics. It blew the competition off the stands. It was an animal that wouldn't be caged and it eventually grew beyond the bounds of the printed page.Dredd's road to the screen was as filled with as many problems as the average Dredd prog (as the episodes were called in 2000 AD). People have wanted to make a movie since the 80s; but, technology and lack of vision have hampered it along the way. Instead, Robocop beat it to the punch, swiping the biting satire and black comedy and the over-the-top action (though Deathrace 2000 was there earlier). That would prove a problem to future attempts at Dredd, as it would live in the successful shadow of Paul Verhooven's classic. In the 90s, we got the first attempt, with Sylvester Stallone. It suffered from too much comedy, star ego, and a disjointed story that was too smug for its own good. The film didn't do anyone any favors.This time, Dredd has something worthy of its stature, with a smart tale that introduces us to the world of Megacity 1, the beat for Judge Dredd. It's a metroplex that covers nearly half of the Eastern Seaboard of the US. It is a decayed world, with minicities within towering megablocks. Violence and chaos rule, which is met with the strong arm of the law, via the Judges. The greatest of which is Judge Dredd. Dredd is the never-tiring hammer of justice, rung out on the anvil of the city. In this story, he has been tasked to evaluate a special rookie, Judge Anderson, a mediocre student; but, one possessed of immense psychic ability. They head out to investigate a multiple homicide in the Peachtrees megablock. What they find is a world controlled by a vicious gang, who are manufacturing and distributing a drug, Slo-Mo, which causes the world to pass in slow motion to the user. Dredd and Anderson soon find themselves locked in with the gang, as the whole complex is set against them, or terrified into inaction. They are cut off from back-up and the only way is forward.The script captures much of what makes Dredd iconic, while allowing new viewers into the world. There are easter eggs for the fans, but one doesn't have to have read 35 years of comics to comprehend things. If there is anything missing from the script, it's the proportion of dark humor that permeates the comics. It's there is small doses, but not writ as large as on the comic page. This is probably a good thing, since the film seeks to introduce the world. Better to stick to the main thrust and let people get used to this world, before we start turning things on their head. It's probably also a reaction to the previous film, which went too far into the humor and lost the point of the story. Regardless, the script works.Karl Urban deserves great praise. In an industry driven by ego (which crippled the previous film), Urban is willing to forgo having his face on screen and embody Dredd, never seen without his iconic helmet, unless hidden in shadow. Dredd is a character of few words, giving greater weight to those few, and Urban delivers them as they were intended. This is a true character performance.Olivia Thrilby makes for a fine Anderson, a rookie with talent, but one who is on the fence. The film is her baptism of fire. Thrilby captures the fear, curiosity, anger, and confidence in equal measures.Leana Hedey is Ma-Ma, the ganglord who has set off the chain of events that leads the Judges to her domain. Hedey plays the controlled psychopath. She isn't that physically imposing, but she dominates through force of personality and sheer willpower.The filmmakers make smart decisions, using their limited budget in service to the story. By keeping the environment contained, they keep things centered on the plot and don't waste effects for attention- grabbing. Even the 3-D feels organic, rather than tacked-on or in a desperate attempt to call attention to the shot.This is a great intro and one hopes that future films will follow, so we can see more of this world and maybe a bit more of the satire that elevated Dredd beyond just a sci-fi action strip. I, for one, am still waiting for Judge Death and Judge Cal would make for a fun adventure, somewhere down the road.",Dredd
125,cultfilmfreaksdotcom,Episodic & Involving Violent Gusto,6,8 April 2013,"An ultra-violent take on the Judge Dredd comic books, set in a futuristic world where criminals have turned American cities into demilitarized zones, probably wanted to separate itself from the maligned 1990's Sylvester Stallone flick. Although Karl Urban, in Dredd's metallic uniform, does somewhat resemble – at least from the nose down – the action icon as he speaks with a similar guttural growl, leaving most of the dialog to his sidekick, who thankfully isn't Rob Schneider.Enter Olivia Thirlby's Cassandra Anderson, brand new to the force of elite judges who don't sit behind a desk with a gavel, passively passing judgment after the cops have done their work. These roving crime-fighters are the police, the jury and more often than not, the executioner while Cassandra, a doe-eyed rookie partnered with Dredd to investigate a triple homicide within an ominous high rise, has more than one Ace: she's also a ""mutant"" psychic able to find truth with a touch of the hand.While THE AVENGERS successfully garnered a contained ""We got a problem"" storyline, the DREDD protagonists are caught knee-deep inside the problem: Once both judges arrest a drug dealer whose testimony could bust the sinister gang leader Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) a cold, calculating vixen pushing a drug called ""Slow Mo"" giant doors lock everyone within the mazy building interior. Thus 95% of the film has our heroes trying to get out with the perpetrator and more importantly, their lives.The soundtrack, reminiscent of John Carpenter's early compositions, is a dark metronomic heartbeat keeping the action flowing from one shootout to the next. Unfortunately Dredd, although one tough cookie and a fun guy to root for, isn't that much different from his aggressive gun-wielding adversaries, especially when a group of bad judges arrive during the 11th hour. Perhaps his sidekick, who eventually realizes her heart might not be in this brutal occupation, has something to do with his ability to remain alive – since we only get one introductory scene without her assistance, Dredd's a difficult title character to entirely distinguish on his own merit.While Cassandra's visible flashes into other people's thoughts often distract from the steely mainline, she's an effective co-lead who's much more than eye candy, helping the somewhat basic story, feeling like a singular episode of a JUDGE DREDD cable series, be the high-octane motion picture it vehemently strives for.",Dredd
126,osj2507,"Dark, brutal, violent, explosions and action packed films, this is for you",8,16 September 2015,"This is a boys film, or maybe just if you like dark, brutal, violent, explosions and action packed films this is for you.I remember the old one with Sylvester Stalone and that was a very nice action movie when that came out, this is something different, maybe more like the comics (don't know, haven't read them, just heard it was so). I definitely like the whole dark theme, this has to be more brutal and has to have a whole different vibe around it and in that it succeed very well. Karl Urban is also a good choice for Dredd, but he also hides behind the mask all the time, I would have liked to see the man behind the mask a couple of times during the film and not just the hard shell, angry, law abiding judge all the time.But if you like action, lots of bullets flying around, explosions, fast moving, never a dull moment, I properly could go on... this is a movie for you.",Dredd

128,ethanbresnett,Enjoyable but not great,6,6 May 2021,"I had barely even heard of Judge Dredd going into this film, so everything from the character to the concept to the world were alien to me. With this in mind, I thought the film got off to a decent start. There was some much needed but blissfully short and sweet narrative exposition, and then we find ourselves in the midst of an action sequence. Little time was wasted getting stuck in to the action which I enjoyed.From this point on we pretty much get relentless action for the rest of the runtime. The plot is very simple. Our protagonist is trapped in a building with a bunch of criminals. Nothing more complicated than that, and it didn't need to be.The action is the main draw of this film, so that's where I will focus my attention and where my judgement of this film ultimately stemmed from. I did enjoy it, but it didn't blow me away. At times it was a little cartoonish and comic booky, and I wasn't always onboard with the style. It was never boring or bad, but it was far from incredible.Then there are the characters. I love Karl Urban and think he has a great filmography under his belt, but he didn't shine in this film. Wearing a helmet for the entirety didn't help, and neither did the dialogue, but its far from his best. Lena Headey and Domnhall Gleeson were good, as was Olivia Thirlby, but again none of them were amazing.Dredd is definitely one to watch for action lovers. It has a good plot and premise, good pacing, lots of action, and is entertaining. I was expecting slightly more though and it is unlikely to blow you away.",Dredd
129,hellholehorror,Pretty darn good,8,28 September 2021,"I was expecting this to be terrible having associated it with the previous one, Judge Dredd (1995). But it was not! I was actually pretty darn good. It's very violent, has an unexpected story, and interesting characters. It's not too silly and not too serious. The action is exciting and the 3D is relatively well done. Some of the darker shots were a bit grainy but other than that the technical aspects were solid. It is gory which I was not expecting. The drug sequences were well done and memorable.",Dredd
130,nikola17,Awesome everyone should check out Dredd this movie was my favorite movie of (2012),10,27 September 2013,"this movie was so underrated this movie should not be bomb it's not that high budget movie it was $45 Million and box office $36.5 million. i don't know why they put very very very good movies into bomb Dredd 3D, the much-anticipated (in some quarters) action sci-fi, opened at no. 5 on the North American box office chart, with a dismal $2.23 million at 2,506 venues on Friday according to studio estimates found at Box Office Mojo. Directed by Peter Travis and starring Karl Urban in the title role, Dredd will probably bring in around $6-6.5 million for the weekend — despite 3D surcharges. (Photo: Karl Urban Dredd 3D.) That would be a downright abysmal opening — worse than the already dreadful $8 million to $10 million that pundits had predicted — for the much-talked about reboot of the Sylvester Stallone movie Judge Dredd, which debuted with a already-not-that-impressive $12.29 million ($22.6 million adjusted for inflation) back in 1995. A Lionsgate release in North America, the international co-production Dredd has a reported $45-50m budget; the film's only chance of recovering its production budget (of course, not factoring in Pre-sales , etc.) is the international box office, where 3D action movies perform much more strongly than in North America. Box-office hope for Dredd 3D? The good news: Judge Dredd cumed at a weak $34.69 million (approx. $64 million adjusted) in North America, but went on to earn more than twice as much abroad. The bad news: Despite grossing $113.49 million worldwide, Judge Dredd was still flop, as it cost a reported $90m. (Remember: as a rule of thumb distributors / producing companies get about 50-55% of the domestic gross; 40% of the international gross.) The worse news: Dredd will likely cume at $15-18 million in North America, which means it'll need to gross about six times as much internationally so as to break even at the worldwide box office — despite having cost much less than the Stallone original, especially if inflation is taken into account. To date, things don't look all that promising: $4.4 million in the UK and $784k in Spain after ten days (Sept. 16). But we'll see. that is F*CKED UP !!! even this movie was fun and underrated movie yet made why could Hollywood could of bombed Remake of Total Recall (2012) ??? that should be bomb not Dredd there is thousands of Dredd Fans out there waiting for next sequel they should do next sequel for fans to do Dredd on 3D people when the people look at Dredd they no COME ON LOOK AT POSTER FOR CRYING OUT LOUD IT LOOKS AWESOME MOVIE EVER YET MADE !!!!! i love this because it wasn't remake it's like Batman Begins but why this should BOMB this should not bomb Screw Hollywood Pu**y likes Twilight and Hunger Games was the crap i love scene in Dredd when shot guy with gun Dredd Says Hot Shot,shoots the guy in month the guy head is melt like ice-cream the 3D shots was great and action slow motion was awesome when Dredd blow up the Door shooting all guys in head in slow motion the movie used kinda cgi not really more combining high-speed photography and Color saturation if see movie then you will understand this movie is like 80's style with music and Apartment Shooting with Mini guns from Terminator 2 shoot at Dredd blowing up all room out this movie has a lot of non stop Action if you want Action this is Right Movie for you but people who watch drama or another movies says boring i get bored with action movies there are not action fans this is for everybody and Action fans i love original Judge Dredd with Sylvester Stallone this is not Remake this is like Batman Begins Restart movie this 10/10 MAKE DREDD 2!!!!!!",Dredd
131,lagudafuad,Same old action shooting,5,12 October 2012,"When a movie depicts a guy running and moving around like terminator, I get turned off.Judge Dredd has been a comic icon for a long time, the fictional character's comic strip in the British science fiction anthology 2000 AD is the magazine's longest running, since 1977.Dredd is an American law enforcement officer in a violent city of the future where uniformed Judges combine the powers of police, judge, jury and executioner. Dredd and his fellow Judges are empowered to arrest, sentence, and even execute criminals on the spot. IGN ranked him 35th in the Top 100 Comic Book Heroes.The 1995 adaptation of the movie was named Judge Dredd and it earned a Golden Raspberry Award nomination for Sylvester Stallone as Worst Actor.This 2012 remake, is not related to it 1995 release, and it was shot in South Africa over a period of 13 weeks. Written and produced by Alex Garland who I remember from the movies 28 days later, Dredd is a movie for the action freaks. Its story is not bad at all, it is solid and straight forward, which I have to give a salute to Garland for that. But the movie wasn't it for me.The movie plot is about the future America. Mega City One – is a vast, violent metropolis where criminals rule the chaotic streets.The Judges are and feared throughout the city, Dredd (Karl Urban) is the ultimate Judge who has to wipe the city of a scourge which is a dangerous drug called ""Slo-Mo"" which gives users the ability to experience reality at a fraction of its normal speed.Dredd is assigned to train and evaluate Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), a rookie with powerful psychic abilities thanks to a genetic mutation.A crime calls them to a neighborhood where fellow Judges rarely dare to venture - a 200 storey vertical slum controlled by prostitute turned drug lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey).Peter Travis the director (The Jury) to me had minimal work to do, as most of the film location was a 200 story building and the movie was just straight forward no twist or turns, not taking credit from his work as he did a fine job based on what the script provided.Dredd was played by Karl Urban, who was wonderful in the movie RED, he was also in Lord of the rings: The Return of the king, the Bourne Supremacy, Doom and Priest.I won't say don't watch Dredd based in the fact that my idea of a good action movie may differ from yours, but if you are going to go see it www.lagsreviews.com",Dredd
132,blackmamba99971,Not a bad remake,8,2 January 2013,"As far as remakes go, I have to say this one actually was done much closer to the comic than the first one with Sly Stallone. Judge Dredd, a man who's distinct ability to weed out criminals and bring them to justice as Judge Jury and executioner is a fine example of how it really should be. Karl Urban (Dredd) did a great job as the dreaded Dredd himself. This movie showed the gritty, dirty, and down right moral exempt activities to those who do not listen to justice. In the comics, it is displayed as bloody, no remorse actions from any criminal or judge, and this movie provided such content. A rare treat to see, although I wished that the movie went outside Peachtrees block to the rest of the city to keep the story more interesting with different locations or more story content for which the judges are on the run for. Simply encasing the two judges in one building was fine, but it should have went outside to expand where the idea of bought judges from Mama, (lena Heady) could have achieved even more. Mama was of course the ideal evil ex hooker criminal inquisitor, and Lena Heady pulled it off without a hitch. In the middle of the two veterans of crime, is a young girl Psychic Anderson (Olivia Thirlby). Her power is so extensive she can actually peer into the mind of who she ever came across, strong willed or not. And this by the Hall of Justice's point of view, is an incredibly valuable asset. Partnered with Dredd, they can both find and bring in the most violent criminals or execute them on the spot without even breaking a sweat thanks to her gift. I think there might be a sequel in the future, and Urban I hope will take the role again. He does fit the profile much cleaner than sly, in fact, he's definitely made for the role. A great performance all round, bloody, good music, no holds barred action which makes the Judge Dredd series a cult classic. Highly recommended to those above age 17.",Dredd
133,djfrost-46786,Ok,4,9 August 2018,This movie was ok. Nothing what I was expecting cause it's a 7 out of 10 on the ratings. Nothing anything new for an action movie. Just a typical action movie. Only average to me.,Dredd
134,stevenrotherforth,No Rob Schneider insight! Thank god for that!,10,19 March 2017,"DreddHey I'm a big Stallone fan. Rocky, First Blood, Copland! Absolutely awesome movies, but the crimes he and Rob Schneider committed against Judge Dredd in 1995 should have had them both carted off to the Green mile!Thank our lucky stars for this reboot then. Not often do reboots work but this movie is an absolute blast. It's been done properly by people who care. There's no helmet being removed here fans!Dredd is set in a violent futuristic city called Mega City one where Judges have the authority to act as Judge, jury and executioner on the spot. Judge Dredd is the best of them and he's played superbly by Karl Urban. A kind of Dirty Harry crossed with the Wolverine. He takes no sh*t people, absolute zero sh*t! When he is tasked at babysitting a rookie by the name of Anderson played by Olivia Thirlby, a simple call to a crime scene at one of the cities many high rises turns into a Raid esque fight for survival as they become trapped inside the locked down building. As I mentioned anyone who has seen The Raid will recognise this movies storyline. The main villain named Ma-Ma played by Lena Headey is sadistically brutal and gives the super tough Dredd a real foe to take on. If you're an action junkie then this movie is for you. A pumping techno sound track is relentless as it beats along with the sound of rapid gunfire. One liners are delivered with efficiency. Like the one where Anderson tells Dredd that her helmet interferes with her psychic ability. Dredd informs her that a bullet might interfere with it more. Violence is turned all the way up to eleven as windpipes are crushed and bodies are thrown from top storeys. Cinematography is wonderful and a film well worth watching in 3D. Colours pop with Hi-def clarity and sound pummels the senses. The Slo-mo scenes are particularly effective as is the editing. We get to see some serious arse kickery. Not too much annoying shaky cam. No ridiculous rapid edits that cause the audience to lose track of what's going on. Dredd is a revelation in the Action genre. A very simple movie in terms of plot but delivers everything it intends to. Why no sequel is beyond me? This film failed to light up the box office due to the abomination Stallone and his cronies had created years before. However word of mouth did secure a successful home video run for this movie that warrants a sequel. The fans are owed that much. No mega budget is needed. Keep it simple just like this one and the studio will be on to a sure fire winner!",Dredd
135,svader,Worth a Watch,6,5 January 2021,Ok easy going movie.Not much of a plot bust some good action.Worth it for Lena H alone.I found Judge Ds change of accent from Kiwi to British sounding to American sounding quite annoying.,Dredd
136,ronbell-23984,Great version of Dredd,10,30 July 2020,"Excellent version of Dredd, now I can erase that Stallone version from my memory. It's definitely taken hints from the original RoboCop in terms of displaying a grim futuristic world for the mass. Pretty brutal but great.",Dredd
137,peefyn,Interesting choice to avoid back story,7,4 May 2016,"I am a sucker for slow motion, and this movie finds an interesting (and justified) reason to use it, and it looks stunning. Like comic panels come to life. The visuals in general are also pretty good, where nothing stands out as especially dated (yet). Karl Urban is a great choice for Dredd, having both the ""mouth"" and the voice for it. The other actors did a good job too.An interesting aspect of this movie is how completely avoids giving any back story to the Dredd-character at all. You sort of pick up that he has a reputation, and you get a feel of his personality, but there's no attempt to go beyond that. This worked surprisingly well, even though it makes it harder for the audience to see if he has anything to lose. Because the law appears to be everything to him, and we assume that he will live through the movie, there's never any sense of peril, or risk.The psychic abilities of the Anderson-character was interesting when used, but ultimately feels like it was added to the mix just to spice things up a bit. It's not important to the plot, and there are situations where you don't understand why she does not use it. I'm not sure if the movie would have been better without it, but it was definitely not used to its full potential.",Dredd
138,p-jonsson,"Much more ""Dredd"" than the 1995 movie",7,16 February 2013,"I think this adaptation of the Judge Dredd comics books are a much more how most people probably would expect that a Judge Dredd movie should be, especially compared to the rather disappointing 1995 version. That of course means that the movie is quite violent. Anyone who has ever read the comics should not be surprised about the fact that this movie is mostly about taking out the bad guys, and if you cannot take out the bad guys using violence then just use more violence.Except for a few gripes that I will come to I quite liked this movie. The plot is a fairly simple one but it is also a plot that I would not have been surprised to find in one of the 2000 AD comics. It is a quite suitable plot for a Judge Dredd movie. The plot centres around the drug ""Slo-Mo"" which slows down your perception of time. This of course gave the director carte blanche to use extreme slow motion effects which could have been quite annoying if overdone. I think it is used quite well in this movie though. I especially liked the effects on the people standing behind the door that Dredd blew in at the beginning of the movie.Judge Dredd himself is well played by Karl Urban and, thankfully, he does not remove the helmet in this movie. I'm sure it was done to satisfy Stallone's ego in the 1995 movie and it was one of the things that ruined it. Judge Dredd is not supposed to remove his helmet, period. ""Ma-Ma"" is also a quite okay bad guy for this movie. Sufficiently psychopathic yet intelligent and rational enough to make a believable, at least as believable as a Judge Dredd villain can be, adversary to Dredd.I have a few gripes about the movie though. My main gripe is that it is not the ultra-modern city from the comics, at least from the comics that I have read since I have not read them all. It is more of a bunch of mega-scrapers spread out among the city slum that is left from today and still looks very non-futuristic. The initial chase scene is done using an old Volkswagen van for Christ sake. I really did not like that and, as far as I am concerned, it lost a star for that. If I remember the comics correctly MegaCity One was built more or less on top of the old ruins.Another thing that I did not like was the crooked judges. Ii is possible that they used the concept of a bad judge in some of the comics, I do not remember, but I still did not like it. The judges are supposed to be above ""ordinary people"". I am sure that they could have come up with some other plot element than that.Anyway, the bottom line is that I quite enjoyed the movie. The fact that the DTS-HD Master Audio sound on my Blu-ray copy was excellent did add to the enjoyment of course. The surround and LFE effects was quite powerful yet balanced so they did not cause my somewhat weak subwoofer to go into resonance. Very enjoyable movie evening indeed.",Dredd
139,EthanBJones_03,Seriously Overrated; Wouldn't Recommend,6,18 April 2017,"​Plot Overview: In a dystopian future, the new law enforcement called 'Judges' determine the fate of many criminals. When Judge Dredd(Karl Urban) and his protégé Judge Anderson(Olivia Trilby) are trapped in a 200 story building, swarming with guards, they have no choice but to fight up and stop the gang once and for all.Directed by Peter TravisStarring Karl Urban, Olivia Trilby and Lena Headley# NO SPOILERSOverall: While this movie does provide some entertainment, I think it's incredibly overrated and doesn't contain enough meat to make it work. I guess I can understand why people like it due to some okay action and a, from my knowledge of the character, faithful representation of the character. Despite this, I think that 2 of the 3 main actors in this movie did poor jobs and mostly mediocre action bring the movie down and ruins the film. If you enjoy this movie, fine but I cannot say I think it is even remotely good but just a tad above average.The type of people who will like this movie will be fans of the character Judge Dredd.Wouldn't Recommend.# POSSIBLE SPOILERS!Karl Urban provided a good presence as Judge Dredd and I will say he was intimidating and could scare his foes. Lena Headley was OK as Ma-Ma but I still believe that many actors, such as Marion Cottilard, could have pulled it off better. Ma-Ma was an okay villain. Karl Urban's acting was subpar and his voice sounded like the love child of Hank from 'Me, Myself and Irene' and Batman from 'The Dark Knight'. Olivia Trilby was pretty poor as Judge Anderson. I found neither of the two main lead characters to be compelling or even remotely likable.I like the concept of a dystopian future with these 'Judges' ruling the law and would be interested in other movies as part of the universe. The actual story itself was pretty weak and I think that making it a training mission(kind of) was a mistake and took away from the whole film. The ending was pretty weak.The cinematography was pretty good in this movie.The effects were fine. Costume and set design were fine.It's 'mildly' entertaining and I could maybe watch it from time to time. From my pretty limited knowledge, it's a faithful representation of the character. The action could either be pretty good or pretty bad. It wasn't 50/50 split and I think there was more poor action than good but there were some entertaining moments.The music was awesome and including blood was a good call.Personally, I didn't enjoy this movie that much but I do see the appeal in it. I can't say I recommend it but I know that may just be from my limited understanding of the character and lore.6/10",Dredd
140,johnnymacbest,Hands down MUCH better than the Stallone flick.,9,23 September 2012,"After the inferior and critically-panned Stallone film, for years I've been waiting for a film that captures the dark, gritty atmosphere, and spirit of the 2000AD character on which it's based and by far they delivered; especially Karl Urban and Olivia Thirlby in their acting. ""Dredd 3D"" is simply the best representation of the titular character ever. Instead of being overblown with special effects, they instead focus on the characters and that is the most important aspect of the comics and they pulled it off really well. I do wish the characters were more developed, but since this is a reboot, I'm willing to overlook that minor quibble.But no film, whether it be based on a comic book or not is not complete without a villain and Lena Headey is spot on as Ma-Ma, a sadist drug lord and a very nasty creature. With her facial expressions and body language, she's as ruthless as they come and the acting by Ms. Headey is both sexy, scary, and terrifying; like a female version of Alex De Large. She's THAT terrifying.But praise is also giving to the cinematography, which is impressive but even more is the special effects of the Slow-Mo drug, that alters reality, not in real life per se, but rather how the brain perceives moments in life. This gives the film an added sense of uniqueness not seen in any previous iteration of Dredd. The fight scenes are brutal and nasty, superbly reflecting the dark and gritty world that Dredd inhabits, again with the slow-mo effects that lets you savor every moment a perp is gunned down by the rightful hand of Dredd's Lawgiver.So after seeing the film, I must say that all players involved have done a remarkable job of giving us a film that is worthy of the character, much like Christopher Nolan's Batman series, which is also superb. A second and third viewing is definitely not out of the question. For those of you who were unfortunate to see the mediocre Stallone version, see this film. Give it a chance, spread good word-of-mouth about it. Dredd deserves to be back on the big screen. Here's hoping a sequel is made. Dredd IS the law!!!",Dredd
141,xamtaro,The one true law,8,12 October 2012,"The world slows, colors are more vibrant, words are pin sharp, everything is more brilliant. No it is not the ad for the new iPad but the effects of the drug ""Slo-Mo"". One experiences a moment of true beauty and wonder; a fleeting moment that feels like an eternity until the ""Slo-Mo drug wears off and you are snapped back to a harsh painful reality. Reality is a scorched earth with the remnants of humanity crammed into the overpopulated ""Mega-City One"". Reality is rampant crime and chaos; the death of a man is a common occurrence that is treated with as much dignity as taking out the garbage. In this grim reality order is maintained by the Judges: futuristic police given the authority to judgment without trial be it a year in an isolation cell or a death sentence. Most notably among them, is the mysterious Judge Dredd (Karl Urban).Resolute, unwavering, and seemingly devoid of bias, pity or empathy, Dredd represents the strict and uncompromising law that he serves; a law that is just as extreme as the criminals he deals with. On a routine training assessment for rookie Judge Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), Dredd and Anderson end up at the notorious ""Peach Trees"" mega block: 200 floors of slums controlled by a gang run by a sadistic drug lord ""Ma-Ma"" (Lena Headley). When the Judges capture one of Ma-Ma's head henchmen, she locks down the entire block and orders the death of both Dredd and Anderson. The sentence for the attempted murder of a Judge is death; a sentence that Dredd is more than happy to carry out. It is guns-a-blazing action as Dredd and Anderson blast their way up the Mega Block, going up against enemies within and without toward their ultimate goal of dispensing justice.For fans of the original comic, one would say that this movie does to Judge Dredd what Christopher Nolan did for Batman. This ""Nolan-ised"" Judge Dredd sports a uniform more akin to modern day Special Forces gear than his comic book get-up. Gone are the aliens, robots, hover bikes and space ships. This is a future that is grounded in our current reality. Other than the presence of the Mega Blocks, the city wall and the Judges' Hall of Justice, Mega-City One is your standard crowded metropolis of today with familiar architecture.Yet the movie succeeds in remaining true to the spirit, heart and soul of the concept and the character (a lot more so than the 1995 Judge Dredd movie starring Sylvester Stallone). Karl Urban IS Dredd. His mannerisms, body language and voice are a perfect fit for this faceless lawman of the future. All the other roles are played so well that you forget about the actors and just see them as the characters they are. This proves once again that one does not need big name actors to make a good movie, just good actors. .Director Pete Travis and his team manage to find the perfect balance between no-holds-barred action and quiet lulls between the gunfire. At no point does the movie drag; the ""talk time"" serves to flesh out the characters and build up tension which is then released in the many stylish shootouts. Accompanying the carnage is a synth rock soundtrack by composer Paul Leonard Morgan. In this age of loud bass, heavy percussions and grand orchestral movie scores, it is refreshing to hear DREDD's synth soundtrack. The composer weaves a familiar heavy metal and electronic rock sound that is agile beyond belief; going from intense pulse pounding to match the action scenes to an ethereal and surreal feel for the ""Slo-Mo"" scenes.On that note, DREDD is one movie that turns slow motion into a true work of art. Drops of water shimmer like diamonds as they fall, smoke billows like clouds in heaven. This creative cinematography and use of special effects make the slow motion scenes stand out from other abusers of slow motion filming such as Paul WS Anderson's Resident Evil retribution.DREDD is able to prevent itself from being a typical ""all action no brains"" movie. Within its narrative lies unique characters, a frightful vision of our possible future and a small snicker of satire. Its fast paced plot, grim protagonist and gritty violence hearkens back to the golden age of the 80s action films while its creative cinematography matches that of high concept arts films.The bottom line is, everything from the visuals, the story, the music and the characters fit together to produce one magnificent adaptation of the beloved UK comic book.Truly a rare diamond in the rough amidst the run-of-the-mill modern action flicks. And despite critical acclaim, DREDD is no doubt destined to be serverely underrated by box office takings.",Dredd
142,cat_ranchero,Liked it a tad more than the critics did... What do they know anyway?...,8,28 July 2013,"Very well made with some excellent cinematography; particularly the depiction of the effects of the SLO-MO drug; I found this very effective (even in 2D). I liked that this film was much edgier with a much tougher, uncompromising Dredd. Great performances all round with Karl Urban, Olivia Thirlby and Lena Headey standing out. Dredd never takes his helmet off and this is much truer to the original comic books, another thing I liked about this one. The music was good without being outstanding; it complemented the picture pretty well with some nice themes here and there. On the down side, I guess the script could have done with a little more work and they never get the Judges bikes right. They still look like a standard bike with a big faring tacked on; I maybe expected better this time. Loved all the various weapons and tech though! Over all, I enjoyed this one; it didn't fall into cliché too much and had a nice gritty edge to it. I doubt they'll make a sequel, but if they do, I will be in line for a ticket.SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.9/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",Dredd
143,kgprophet,Stylish Comic Book World meets Raid: Redemption,6,17 March 2013,"It is the Blade Runner world, Los Angeles with mega-structures. Dredd is an authorized sheriff. He breaks in a rookie that is out of her league. The villain is a drug lord who has taken over an apartment complex. Not long before this movie came out, a similar scenario happened in the cult action flick, The Raid: Redemption. A gang leader is in a penthouse of an apartment building filled with killers. The hero ends up going it alone with a couple buddies.When you break down both films, it is still the Die-hard formula (which really was the First Blood formula). A lone cop with overwhelming odds uses his wits to defeat bad guys. Toss in the bad apple in the police department. So how to not collapse by the weight of all the clichés? This time the sidekick is an empath. All touchy feely but looks like a hot intergalactic gumshoe in her uniform. Add stylish framing, matching for sure the comic book source that created this science fiction world. There is an elevated level of empty emotions with Dredd. We never know his background (or see his eyes). He makes robotic decisions almost like a terminator, or say a terminator cop, perhaps a ""RoboCop"".Dredd never gets hurts even though he is banged up in several moments in the film. He always is one step ahead in the pursuit as the good guys make their way up to the penthouse. The stylish violence reminded me of perhaps David Fincher in the artistic slow motion of faces being blown apart, and bodies flattening on a concrete surface after plummeting 200 stories. Slo Mo is also the name of the drug that makes life appear to go in slow motion. These scenes succeed in turning the action into a fantastic voyage as we see the minuscule blood drops do an aerial ballet as it splatters a 1000 frames a second.What really won me over with this reboot of the original Judge Dredd back in 1995 was the empath character's arc. Looking like a pixie, Olivia Thirlby literally glows as she floats her mind through the wall and into bad guy's minds. The low budget is not a drawback, as was not The Raid: Redemption. Both had some fresh approaches to presenting the action scenes. Dredd also benefits from competent acting. I'm sure the similar story lines are not deliberate, but it certainly works when done right.",Dredd
144,tankace,Dredd deserved more,9,11 March 2016,"This movie is to put in simple words brutal and beautiful at the same time. Carl Urban owned the role to the point that for a while thought that he was the real judge ,not an actor playing him. Unlike the 1995 movie ,which is one of the worst of its kind, it portraits the environment perfectly,which grounded in realism and the director did not hold back any graphic seen. The real reasons it flopped, was the studio had no idea who to promote this creation and the bad memories from the Stallone's flick. Dredd deserve for good reason its cult status, it has gain the past four years (this review was written in 2016) and every macho man or a person who generally loves action films should watch this movie.",Dredd
145,jamiedarlow-37510,An incredible display of exciting action and insanely fun gore!,9,5 March 2020,"This reboot of Judge Dredd focuses on the titular graphic novel character (coming to life through Karl Urban) teaming up with rookie Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) to take down a gang who are selling and promoting the use of the mind-altering super drug, SLO-MO. Before the release it was being hyped up as being more faithful to the source material than previous big screen outings especially with the character representation. It's awesome to say that they nailed it and Urban does a great job. Visually it is really breathtaking; the use of slow motion is of course used frequently to coincide with the drug's impact on different characters and I think the technique is used very impressively here! The main sequence that stands out for me is when someone falls from the top floor of the apartment block that the film takes place in, ending in a ridiculously squelchy death that is one of the most beautifully filmed shots of gore I have ever seen in cinema! I loved the fact that the majority of screen time takes place inside one building and a lot of the action consists of them fighting their way to the very top to confront the gang leader Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) who is also great as the villain. It's interesting to hear recently that Urban has said the actual director of the film was the screenwriter Alex Garland (Ex Machina, Annihilation) rather than Pete Travis who it was credited as; which actually makes complete sense when you look at the distinctive gorgeous style of Garland's other films and this one! From the opening chase sequence to the ending, it's a real treat to watch and I'd recommend it for any comic book, action film fan or gory film enthusiast; fingers crossed for a sequel!",Dredd
146,dvc5159,He is the law,8,22 September 2012,"I admit I am not familiar with Judge Dredd the comics, but I did see the 1995 film with Sylvester Stallone, and, well... I wouldn't say it wasn't entertaining, but... Now comes the updated ""Dredd"". And it is surprisingly a thrill.Never mind that the story is basically a pastiche of ""Blade Runner"", and this year's ultra-violent ""The Raid"". If ""The Raid"" was ultra-violent, then this is uber-violent. It's rated R? Should be NC-17. It's surprisingly gory. Heads and limbs are smashed, fly off and explode in realistic, bloody detail. Bullet wounds and broken bones look all-too realistic. Dozens of innocents are slaughtered graphically by the sadistic villainness.But why did I enjoy this movie? Because all of those scenes fit within the film's gritty, edgy new atmosphere, courtesy of director Pete Travis (""Vantage Point"") and especially production designer Mark Digby and cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle (both of whom have worked on ""Slumdog Millionaire""). Mantle's very stylish cinematography stands out here: we have nice wide angles to appreciate the special effects and sets, and the violence in all its brutality. Paul Leonard-Morgan's effective and gritty techno bass score cues everything at the right moments, and the editing is paced nice and tight with a cohesive flow throughout, instead of the usual cut-cut-cut and paste job of today.I want to mention a terrific use of slow motion where all four technical aspects combine. The use of slow motion when the crooks take a special drug (appropriately titles SLO-MO) is among the most stylish and positive uses of the editing technique I've seen. Those hallucination sequences are superb and creative visually, it feels all too real (maybe a bit more if you watch the sequences in the good but unspectacular 3D).How about our hero? Karl Urban makes Dredd his own. Echoing Clint Eastwood's own Dirty Harry persona (there's even a scene which reminds me of ""Magnum Force"") - he scowls and growls and dishes out hard brutal justice the only way he knows how. Urban is great in one of his few lead roles - and let's hope the fans agree. Lena Headey really makes a nasty, sadistic and cruel villainness that permeates the film's atmosphere as well, while Olivia Thirlby is a pretty face, doesn't really bring anything new, but yet doesn't stand out from the film. Although I am glad Travis and screenwriter Alex Garland does not force a stupid romance between her character and Dredd. It just doesn't fit.Overall, this is a surprisingly intense thrill ride. It is loud and flashy, and occasinally big, but it is all done right. Pete Travis makes a usual story/screenplay into a stylish, uber-violent futuristic action pic, he goes for ambition and fills the film with more stylistic touches and goes straight for the jugular. More importantly, he is one of the few directors who knows when and especially how to use slow motion. Take that, Michael Bay.If you're looking for blood and carnage, and Karl Urban's great take on Dredd, then this is the movie for you. This makes Stallone's movie look like camp.Overall: 77%",Dredd
147,fciocca,"Basically the ugly copy of The Raid, but on a Cyberpunk world",4,4 November 2020,"Maybe I am going upstream with this ""review"", but even though it is kinda decent as an action movie, it reminded a lot about ""The Raid"" by director Gareth Evans. His movie was even released one year prior than ""Dredd"". For sure screenwriters took a lot of inspiration. Action scenes are entertaining, but honestly on my perspective were pretty mediocre: the CGI is not good at all, you can clearly see that the blood is fake, but let's say that this was made on purpose, as the film is based on a comic book, the problem is that also the rest looks pretty bad. There is violence and sequences are graphic, but there are even more violent movies with better stunt scenes, as The Raid mentioned already above or the latest Robo Cop chapter released more or less in the same period. Stunt sequences also were nothing special.This for sure is not the best Karl Urban performance. I really like the guy, he was way better on ""Priest"". I did not like how he portrayed Dredd, always with that grin on his face and his forced deep voice. The co-worker judge Anderson was even worse, no personality whatsoever, I don't care about her and she was basically useless for the whole movie. The actress did an awful job, and in my opinion she can't act. Not even the villain is decent in this movie, I did not felt menaced by her, and it was portrayed by Lena Headley, not for sure the first person picked up from the street. Well I guess that the cast did not have much to work with a script like this.In 2012 with a 50 million budget just for production costs, creators could come up with something better. We are talking about a blockbuster, this is not an indie project. I give 4 stars, because I've appreciated the cyberpunk world that the director built with digital artists, and there a few action sequences that are actually good and entertaining, but for the rest I did not like it at all.",Dredd
148,jackasstrange,Mindless action film with zero content,4,26 December 2013,"I was really impressed about this film. Not in a good way, of course. It has no character development at all. How someone is supposed to feel interested by a character that just does things like blow people up and throw one liners like 'Judgement Time'? Laughable.The things that happened in the film were so implausible that i honestly almost turn it off. The girl has psych powers but for somewhat reason she just uses her gifts in the end of the film. And when she really needs to use the power, like when she was captured, she simply don't! Unbelievable. Also, how Dredd is able to find so quickly the bandit after all the destruction and confusion made by the 'Ma-Ma's Klan'? The viewer has no clue either. And come on... the slow motion thing was supposed to be cool? Give me a break. I am pretty sure that Slow Motion was a very overused technique even in 2012. Not original or impressive at all. The way it was used in this film was just silly and annoying.The cinematography was the only good thing about this film, alongside with the art direction. Really liked the messed lightning used.Overall, pretty bad film with zero character's depth. 4.0/10",Dredd
149,TheMarwood,Judgment time,7,28 December 2014,"Whatever production problems happened behind the scenes, they aren't apparent in the finished product. That director Pete Travis was removed during editing, writer Alex Garland trying to secure a co-director credit and Keith Urban saying he took most on set direction from Garland and not Travis and hell, even Travis' director credit doesn't even come up after the end credits roll, but billed after most of the cast - and his statements about his collaboration with Garland seem more like the usual contractual disparaging nonsense about never saying a bad word that could damage the film. Whatever it was that went down and whatever egos were hurt, Dredd simply works. The premise that takes place over most of a day, of Dredd and a rookie judge in training that infiltrate a mega high rise building over a drug turf war multi murder and find themselves in over their heads - is simple in its plotting and fantastic in its visuals and execution. Lena Headey makes a terrific villain as Ma-Ma, underplaying her dead inside character and Karl Urban's lower half of his face makes a convincing Judge Dredd. The emotional weight of the film is carried nicely by Olivia Thirlby as a psychic rookie Judge. The first 45 minutes fall together marvelously, as the two judges become trapped inside a hostile mega sky rise, but the film becomes a shoot 'em up with faceless corpses piling up for short period - until the narrative begins to propel forward again with a solid last act. With gore 'o plenty and some beautifully filmed slo-mo carnage, Dredd doesn't have a dull moment. It's a lean film that delivers.http://www.boxofficeflops.com/yearly-breakdowns/2012-2/dredd/",Dredd
150,Meven_Stoffat,Dredd-ful,1,18 September 2012,"Dredd 3D is a loud, ugly, violent, repetitive and boring mess or a sci-fi movie. It thankfully runs a mercifully short 95 minutes, but with how drawn out the plot is, you'll feel like you're in the cinema for 180. Though the concept is interesting, the film never does anything with it and instead of even bothering to even try to be remotely interesting even in the least, just pads its runtime out with... erm, violence, violence, and more violence, and when you think the film has reached its violence limit... there's more violence.Mind you, I haven't read the comic book. While I consider myself a comic book fan, I've never really delved into the ""comic book underground"", my only introduction to Dredd was the 1995 film ""Judge Dredd"", starring Sylvester Stallone. Now mind you, speaking as someone who's not a fan of the comic books, that film is indeed a turkey, but its at least fun to watch (kinda like Batman Forever, whereas its following film is just a big, plundering mess with no entertainment value whatsoever). Yeah, it's corny and cheesy and terrible but I didn't hate it, as it was kind of fun.. And Dredd 3D is likewise... minus the ""fun"" part.  And let's be honest guys. If there's been two rather unsavoury adaptations of the comic, maybe we should just admit that the comic sucks, especially if THIS is the best we can come up with.So I won't lie, the first 20 minutes of the movie are fine. I liked the opening monologue with the shots of America (now a single city torn apart by war and radiation), and our little introduction to Dredd as he takes down a SLO-MO dealer. SLO-MO is a popular illegal narcotic that allows people to slow things down and see things all glittery and pretty. And as predicted, this film has lots of unnecessary scenes of people taking the narcotic, in particular scenes where you get to appreciate the apparent beauty of people being shot in the face and glittery and sparkly CGI blood splurts out like this is some kind of faerie tale. And the setup is nice too. He is assigned a psychic rookie who is a judge-to-be. Judges, like Dredd, are cops who are intelligent enough to determine an appropriate sentence on the spot. They go to bust few SLO-MO sellers in a ghetto apartment block named Peach Trees, and the leader of a superior gang named the ""Mama gang"" (I'm not making this up) close down the block to hire the thugs to try and kill the two.So yeah, that sounds kind of fun, and it is for the first 20 minutes., even despite the stupid name of ""mama gang"". Then... it's just shootout upon shootout upon shootout. And that may sound fun... but it's just not. The first shootout near the opening is fun, as Dredd tosses a gas grenade up a flight of stairs and, with the assistance of his rookie, guns everyone down. Then it gets repetitive and boring. I'm sure immature 14 year old boys will love the movie because it's full of action, but to me... Its just DULL. Mind you, I don't mind if a movie is all action and no story. Watch ""The Raid: Redemption"" if you want a film that manages to pull that off well. But at least that film had some humour and was done in a very tongue-in cheek way. There is no such redemption in Dredd. With maybe one or two chuckles and at least 60 minutes of slow motion and shooting, it's simply a chore to sit through.Thankfully we have a bit of a breather in the middle, as the film takes maybe a 10 minute break. And see, the film is quite interesting at this point, where Mama puts Dredd, the suspect and the psychic in a lockdown to keep them from moving up or down any floors. But then... Another shootout breaks out. And at this point, the film becomes a chore to watch.Fortunately, the performances from Karl Urban (Dredd), Lena Headey (Mama) and the blond chick who plays the psychic are decent.  I mean, they're not going to win any Oscars, but they did what they could with the undeniable  lack of content. They try, and holy spangles, do they ever try with what very little content they're given, but even their impressive performance fail to save this horrid mess of a film. I'm sure this movie appeals to hardcore fanboys of Judge Dredd, and I'm guessing that if I were a fanboy, I'd indeed be raving, but the reality is, Dredd is unfortunately a big and sloppy mess of an overblown, violent film that does very little to redeem the large amount of action with zero substance. There may be lots in store for the fanboys, but for the rest of us, there's just nothing here.",Dredd
151,flingebunt,"Exciting, interesting, but not really Dredd",6,1 March 2013,"In the future, the world is a wasteland and people live in megacities, jammed in together law breaks down and criminals are so rampant that only 6% of serious crimes can even be responded to.So the Judges exist to not police the law by being judge, jury and executioner. The Judge Dredd comics work on many different levels, they are action stories, they are satire, think pieces and commentary about the nature of crime and justice, comedy, and they are tales from a city they we believe will likely to exist some time in the not too distant future.Taking its cue from Batman Begins, this movie tries to put Judge Dredd into the real world. Which is partly disappointing, but enticing. Here our 2 judges, Dredd and Anderson (of course Anderson as she is the only Judge that doesn't wear a helmet) take on a simple drug bust in the world's nastiest city, fighting their way through the levels of a megablock to serve out justice.Sorry guys, it is a fun movie, but doesn't do Dredd the least amount of justice, it becomes an action movie with action heroes, the very thing that Dredd was sending up in the first place.Welcome to judge Dredd light...no imagination or depth, just lots of action...oh well let's see what they do with the second movie.",Dredd
152,Donatien3,"Dark, brutal, violent and brilliant!",9,1 November 2012,"The year 2012 has been another big one for comic book films, led by 'The Avengers', 'The Amazing Spider-Man' and 'The Dark Knight Rises'. The latest comic book hero to make it on screen is a lesser one – Judge Dredd – from the British 2000AD comics. While most fans will be aware of the infamous Sly Stallone film from 1995, the new 'Dredd' reboot distances itself from the previous movie and stays true to the character's gritty style.Set in a bleak, desolate America of the future (Mega City One), Dredd (Karl Urban) is a part of a group of cops called the Judges, who administer punishment to the city's criminals. Dredd is charged with investigating the infiltration of the drug Slo-Mo, which allows users to experience reality at a fraction of its normal speed. While on the case, he is joined by a psychic mutant named Anderson (Olivia Thirby) whom Dredd refers to as ""Rookie"". Their target is Ma-Ma (Lena Headley), a former prostitute turned drug lord. There's a lot to like about this film: the first is the violence – it's brutal, gory, at times over-the-top (it definitely earns its MA rating) and the Slo-Mo drug ensures the 3D is actually used to great effect rather than just as a gimmick. Urban is brilliant as Dredd, wearing a permanent frown and being very direct in his language. His main aim is to administer justice to the criminals of Mega City One. Nothing else matters. While Anderson's psychic abilities seem out of place in such a gritty film, she is able to use her abilities to help Dredd. Another positive for the film is Headley as the main villain. She's quite scary and intimidating and proves you don't need an elaborate costume to be an effective bad guy.The great thing about 'Dredd' is that it keeps its dark and violent tone: there's no awkwardly manufactured happy ending to keep the studio happy and we are spared a forced romantic sub-plot between Dredd and Anderson. Their relationship is strictly professional. At times 'Dredd' makes the more mainstream comic book movies look like harmless kids films.If you're a fan of the original comic book series, you'll be happy with this reboot. Even if you've never heard of Judge Dredd, there's still plenty to enjoy.",Dredd
153,Thrashman88,Soulless at best...,6,3 November 2013,"I never saw Sylvester Stallone's take on this comic book hero, nor ever read a single comic. I know about Judge Dredd because of the Anthrax song ""I Am The Law"". When watching this film last night all I could think of is how wonderful it would've been to include that classic Anthrax song into the soundtrack of DREDD. But even if it had been included, little could it do to enhance an otherwise lifeless movie. Perhaps under a more talented director, DREDD would've fared better. Sure, there's lots of violence and action, but if feels ""hollow"" somehow and only Olvia Thirlby's character is somewhat the more humane one with some decent acting. You never see Karl Urban's (Dredd)face, and I seriously believe anyone could've done his role as the vengeful judge. Very little background is given of all characters so I felt very little attachment to anyone except Judge Anderson (Olvia's character).There's some background about the movie's main villain, Ma-Ma, played unconvincingly by Lena Heady (too nice looking for a ruthless villain, despite having a disfigured face)and what made Judge Dredd the man he is is never address and only hinted at during the first few minutes of the film. Trust me, I like big, dumb, gory violence, like Robocop, but where that movie was over-the-top it also had a damn good story too, not just mindless gore.Maybe I expected too much of DREDD. I did enjoy it, but as the film moved along it seemed that it never went past the first act. I can only suspect that it did well enough at the box office for producers to make a sequel. Maybe the second time around they'll do justice to Judge Dredd.",Dredd
154,jb_campo,Onslaught of a flick - in your face action,7,23 May 2021,"I really like this 2012 Dredd starring Karl Urban (Star Trek films) as Judge Dredd. I saw Urban in another film and thought it sub-B grade at best, but as Dredd, oh he nailed it. You never see his full face throughout because his visor hides his eyes. But what he does with his motions and voice are outstanding. At times, he has that almost Robocop walk and movement. It's fantastic.Dredd gets to train up a rookie and based on his judgment on that day's performance, she either passes or not. The rookie has some special abilities that are helpful thruout the movie. Dredd gets called to a scene at one of the mega-apartment buildings where the bad guy drug overlords rule. It's like Dredd against a 1000 bad guys. No problem.That's about all you need to know. Dredd has to overcome tremendous adversity to get his man or woman. The partners work well together. The bad guys are really bad bad guys, and the good guys, well, expect some twists.Excellent directing kept this moving fast n tight. The overall theme is dark, bloody, violent, and loud. There is excellent use of slow motion camera to accentuate things going on, and it works really well.I never saw the Stallone version of Dredd, but this one with Urban will be hard to beat. Watch this if you want to see a non-stop action movie of good guys against bad guys in a futuristic setting. That's a common theme, but Dredd stands out by having terrific acting and a pretty good plot. Enjoy.",Dredd

I know you might still have a bad taste in your mouth from that Silvester Stallone flick, but this one will make you forget all about that. This film is exactly what it wants to be. The characters are simple, but effectively put together. Dredd (Karl Urban) is an immovable pillar of justice that wields a pistol. The villains he is pitted against are scum of the Earth and need to be eliminated. Does that sound like too little substance for you? Don't worry about it because we've got Dredd's rookie sidekick Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) and a memorable, well written villain in the form of Lena Headey as Ma-ma. Once we have our characters set up, I was excited to see them in a plot that is just like our titular character; straight to the point, with no nonsense or fat to trim. You've got great action, action that is even more exciting because it's set to an awesome electronic score. I saw the movie in 3D and I have to say that looked pretty good too. One minute I was laughing at how awful and over-the-top violent this future is, the next I was genuinely cringing at the bloody mess that's made out of the thugs pitted against our heroes. It's a great time at the movies and you'll be eager to see another installment because this is a lot smarter than your average action movie, even if the plot is as straight forward as a bullet to the head.

160,Quebec_Dragon,Stronger than the sum of its parts,7,28 October 2012,"I was wondering why I liked it so much, even though if you take most of the individual elements, they ""seem"" to be lacking or absent. The character Judge Dredd himself is basically your grim, mostly expressionless anti-hero, without a likable personality, few lines (no wisecracking) and no character depth or development. Yet he works, perhaps because it makes the other characters (especially rookie psychic partner Cassandra) more human. The location is very limited (a humongous building holding a big city's population) for the vast majority of the movie. It's gritty and mostly realistic despite the fact it could could have been wide-ranging and futuristic. Yet it works, because it makes it urban and focused, avoiding corniness. The plot is simple, reaching the top of a quarantined building to arrest a crime lord. Yet it works perhaps because of its narrative drive, isolated ""heroes"" stuck in a desperate situation, and intimate nature.The violent action is not glorified or stylish (with a few slow-mo exceptions). It's usually quick, brutal and efficient. Judge Dredd does not indulge in kung-fu acrobatics or fancy gun-play. Yet it works because violence is not supposed to be spectacular or cheered. It also works because it makes things more realistic and grounded. For a sci-fi movie in the future, there are relatively few special effects or futuristic trappings. Yet, it works because in that world, things did not get better, it's an extrapolation of our current urban cities. It works because it makes the ultra slow-motion sequences (cleverly explained by a drug) even more breathtakingly beautiful and unique. There are actually moments of amazing grace in-between the violent parts or, more disturbingly, part of the violence. The 3d effects really shine in those slow-mo sequences, perhaps because we have time to really look at them. There's not much morale or social commentary here as the greatest sci-fi movies usually do, it's more of an action movie with a few sci-trappings. Yet it works anyways perhaps because its outward shallowness is offset by its sincerity leaving the rest to our imagination.The movie was grim and gritty as it should be, yet the overall vision and impact of the film were greater than any individual facet, especially story and characters. I think the adult rating really helped here, giving it an uncompromising, dangerous feel akin to Robocop. Dredd is not deep, glamorous or politically correct, but it's far from dreadful. I liked it a lot, yet I still have trouble finding and defending its virtues.Rating: 7 out of 10 (very good)",Dredd

They keep the action tight, brutal and extremely bloody. Dredd never takes his helmet off and that helps in representing him more as an emotionless, unstoppable justice dealing machine. The human element is provided by young Olivia Thirlby who is a Judge rookie with psychic powers. She's an excellent fit for Dredd and the filmmakers don't make the mistake of using a comedic sidekick (Rob Schneider in 1995) to make it all more accessible to the general public. Shot in South Africa for a low 50m$ on Red One MX cameras (much like District 9) we get beautiful but gritty imagery and tons of high speed slomo shots intended to give you a detailed look at the gratuitous scifi violence.

So this new take on the character actually feels long overdue instead off being forced upon us.Fans will be happy that Judge Dredd this time doesn't take his helmet off, but does find himself restrained too a large building instead off the entire ""mega"" city. The trailer made the movie look like it had a lower budget and this shows in this futuristic city not looking all that futuristic. The fact that Dredd is locked in this building the whole time makes me think it was a way for the makers too save some money. Or maybe they were just going for a more realistic approach too Mega-city, like they did with Batmans Gotham in Christopher Nolans Batman movies. Either way, Karl Urban Looks the part more than Sylvester Stallone ever did, and the movie feels more faithful too the comics in featuring a character that's a mutant and a villain (though not a particularly interesting one) that could off quite easily appeared in the comics pages.This is actually a stand-out movie from all those other comic book movies. But it has too be. Judge Dredd has never been as well known as Spider-man or the Avengers or the likes, so its mega violence and trendy 3D actually seem justified in trying too get it noticed. Don't know why their was absolutely no 2D showings at my local multi-plex. Can't say I like having the 3D forced upon me. But it was actually pretty good.

Karl Urban, wow he did an amazing job, he was cold-blooded, calculating and sarcastic, he kept his mouth curved all the time and he had (most important) his helmet all the time,(for a good reason - he is a judge, jury and an executioner, do a little research on the executioners) just like in the comics! Great! His cold voice only mean one thing - judgment time! Well, let's see other actors as well, we got Olivia Thirlby as a rookie judge who was assigned to Dredd to evaluate her. She was great. And... we got Lena Headey. Now, forget about Bane (kidding) :) Lena's character Ma-Ma was awesome! She was a real, cold, murdering bitch, and she fires from mini-gun! Arnie, eat your heart out, Lena looks more cool with mini-gun than you! No, really, she did an amazing job. Other actors... well, they were unknown and that was somewhat OK, it's always nice to see some new actors on the field.And for the end... costumes were OK, they were pretty simple, but cool. As you can see Dredd's uniform, it's kinda filthy, which means, the guy had experience in Megacity 1, which looks pretty good here, a fine image of some near future, cinematography was also good, in most moments filled with slow motion scenes, for which I thought it was too much, but, you'll find out why, and not to worry there. The musical score was surprisingly good, really bad ass score. The film holds a pretty small amount of CGI, and that makes me happy, really it is a simple film, the plot is in the one giant building and there's no escape. Hell, you can make a freakin' theater show of this film. Watch it, you won't regret it, it's like reading a comic book on big screen in 3D.And remember... judgment time...",Dredd
165,nesfilmreviews,Visually stunning with video game like violence.,7,27 August 2013,"""Dredd"" has nothing innovative to offer that is new or groundbreaking, but the fusion of familiar elements generates a smartly paced, suspenseful 90 minutes that's a vast improvement over the disastrous 1995 version starring Sylvester Stallone. It has the atmosphere of a shoot 'em up video game, and the only thing that's missing is the wireless controller. Heads splatter and bullets rip through body parts at a relentless and continuous pace. ""Dredd"" is superbly designed and delivered with relentless carnage from all angles, and even more so impressively utilizing 3D. The sprawling ""Slo-Mo"" sequences are equally impressive as well. At a time when most comic book adaptations try to be all things to all people, ""Dredd"" savagely entertains for those with the stomach for it, and more than satisfies its intended base audience.",Dredd
166,Bruce722,Decent film.,6,6 September 2013,"I have never read the comics so I can't judge Dredd from that perspective, no pun intended. I have seen the original film and now this one so I have judged both of them as stand alone movies. The original movie had a few main weaknesses and I thought this one addressed all of those. I thought the weaknesses of Stallone's Dredd were the lazy writing, the cheesy 1980's styling, and the numerous plot holes. Karl Urban's Dredd kept the high entertainment value, well done action sequences, and unique setting that is Mega-City One and with the corrected flaws, you would think it would be a much better movie. Not so much. While it lost the cheesy 1980's effects, it replaced them with possibly worse made-for-3D cinematic effects that do nothing for the movie and only drag out a not-so-interesting plot. The gore factor was also a bit high. While I am never one to have any issues with violence or anything, I thought this movie was overdone and felt unnecessary. An analogy would be profane language versus a little teenage boy who feels like he has to use profanity to look cool. I don't have a problem with profanity but when it feels forced, it's just stupid. The overly graphic nature of some of the scenes in this film are like that. They felt forced at times and took away from the movie. The plot is also very, VERY different from the original. Essentially they kept the setting and the protagonist and stripped everything else away and just expanded upon the initial sequence from the first film enough to make an entire movie out of it. While I think they did a good job with it, the oversimplified approach wasn't entirely engaging. Urban and Olivia Thirlby do a solid job as the main characters, though, and the film is entertaining so I'd still suggest checking it out if you get a chance.",Dredd

168,FairlyAnonymous,Better than expected,6,25 October 2013,"Dredd is one of those movies that very few people saw in theaters, but apparently a LOT of people saw once it hit Netflix and DVD. Why this is, I don't know, but it probably has something to due with the fact that the last Judge Dredd movie was bad.However... this is good.I was pleasantly surprised that this movie was actually well done and entertaining, though it wasn't a masterpiece by any means. I have mixed emotions with it. The action was good, the slow-motion was beautiful, the violence was over-the-top, and all of the standard effects were nice! The only real down-sides of this movie is the fact that the CGI looks a little dated during certain scenes and the premise is extremely simplistic.One of the things that shocked me the most about Dredd was the fact that it was incredibly simplistic. There aren't any real twists, surprises, or any sub-plots/diversions from the main plot. The movie is all about one event that happens over the course of a couple of hours. That's it. A giant living complex is overrun by thugs, Dredd and trainee go in to wipe them out. As soon as the event is over, the movie ends. For some people this might be a big problem. Most comic book movies attempt to have some sort of complex plot or to at least have three acts. This movie is basically a one act film. I will not lie, it is kind of refreshing at the same time. The movie doesn't pretend to be complex so one can simply sit back and just watch the screen. A lot of movies try to have a complex plot with action, but this movie knows what it is: an excuse to watch a Judge wipe out tons of thugs like a total BA.I will praise the movie for its slow motion scenes. These were really gruesome at times and also stunning to watching. Simple things looked dazzling and elegant. Once again, this element isn't really too important to the plot. The drugs really don't change the plot in any ways, they just simply make it nicer to look at. What would've been interesting is that if drugged up people used guns to a much better degree due to the enhanced reflexes, but this is never touched upon.At the end of the day, Dredd is entertaining to watch and that is about it. The whole concept of it being in the future isn't entirely needed except for the fact that it is a Dredd movie. The thugs use guns that are the same as todays', the clothing is virtually the same, the plot could work in any gang area, the drugs don't effect the plot, and the character Dredd only has his name mentioned once or twice. We never even get to see his background or personality. While it is an entertaining film, I feel as if it wasn't using the Dredd license to its fullest extent. It feels held back.",Dredd
169,kevinxirau,A genuinely good superhero movie.,7,26 January 2013,"Meet Judge Dredd. He is the judge. The jury. The executioner. He...is...THE LAW! In the barren future, where crime fills the streets like a plague, he and his fellow judges are the only cure. Now, with psychic recruit Anderson under his wing, Judge Dredd takes on the most infamous crime boss in town, the cold and cruel drug lord Ma-Ma. With his recruit's telepathy, the best guns and equipment money can buy, and an attitude to match, Dredd is about to deliver some brutal justice. Judgement time! With the exception of ""Predator vs Judge Dredd"", I've never really read the comic books starring the title character, but even I can tell that this is a good movie. I've only seen a couple parts and a review of the original film starring Sylvester Stallone and already I think that was, dare I say it, ""dredd-ful"", all the more reason to see this newer one instead. It nails the character and the world he lives in right from the start, the streets all filthy and hardly a good soul in sight. The dynamic between Dredd and Anderson works quite well, leading to a couple of subtle and occasionally humorous moments. Ma-Ma, while not the best villain I've seen, is a cold-hearted killer with no regards for human life, though is a bit cocky to a fault. Plus, the action scenes are really fun to watch.The only thing that really bothered me was the slightly overused slow-motion meant to emphasize the effects of the drug the movie revolves around. The film didn't get me too excited, but I still had some fun with it. Overall, with a simple yet effective story, great casting, nice action scenes, and a few good twists, Dredd is sure to entertain even newcomers to this brutal saga. Worth a rent and if you're a fan, buy it.",Dredd
170,brianberta,This movie is the faithful adaptation that all of the fans were hoping for,8,15 September 2015,"Dredd is an exciting and fast-paced remake which finally gave the audience the faithful adaptation they deserved. It's not perfect, but it is a huge step up from Judge Dredd (1995).The future America is a wasteland and a large group of people live in Mega City 1. The police force consists of ""Judges"" who have the power of a judge, jury, and executioner. Judge Dredd, the ultimate judge, works to take down a drug cartel only to find himself and a rookie he's with trapped inside one of the mega-blocks where they are forced to fight all f the other members of the Ma-Ma clan.Judge Dredd (1995) was a horrible movie. It was very unfaithful and it made a very poor attempt to parody Dredd. However, Pete Travis decided to make a more faithful adaptation and he succeeded in doing so. Dredd does an amazing job capturing the violence and brutality of its source material.Usually when a movie has extreme violence, you expect that it will be distractingly violent. However, I didn't feel that way about this movie at all. I never felt that the action sequences in the movie looked ridiculous or overly-fanciful and the movie did not overstay its welcome. With that being said, it's great that the movie was still able to remain very faithful without being distractingly violent at all.However, this movie is style over substance. It doesn't have too much depth to the characters. However, it did have a little bit of depth to Cassandra Anderson. It showed that this was her last attempt to become a judge as she failed previously. Also, it shows Judge Dredd and her growing to like each other as the movie goes on. However, this still isn't too much character development and the movie is definitely more about its visual effects.Also, I really enjoyed the slow motion effects. They are really well-done. I'm not going to spoil anything but the slow motion scene at the end is clearly the best one in the film. Because of the effects and music, it is both beautiful and unnerving at the same time. It is definitely one of the more memorable slow motion scenes out there. However, there are also a few other great slow motion scenes in the film which are great too.In conclusion, this is a phenomenal movie. It proved to be the faithful adaptation that fans were hoping for. It is light on character development but it is definitely a must-see film for its great visuals. It is also not distractingly violent at all and it doesn't get carried away with itself. This is a must-see film for all the people who waited to see a faithful adaptation.",Dredd
171,manendra-lodhi,Uninteresting in many ways.,5,28 September 2012,"The film is about an alternate city in which only one judicial power is present and they can even kill criminals without any law. The story looked nice on the surface but when you actually see it there are tons of disappointments. That entire slo-mo thing really sucked. The most irritating thing was the character of MA-MA or the lead villain. She was shown very weak and the ending made it worse. The film is good for action freaks (as I was told), but I did not felt that much action as much we can find in a Bond film.PROS: The film is good in the sense of cinematography and I liked the soundtrack a little bit. The idea of the film too was good.CONS: Narrowing down my comments to specific areas, I would first point the charmless suit that was worn by Dredd. I am not criticizing the fact that his face was not shown. The acting by the other cast was below average. The plot seemed to be funny at most times. The ending was too childish. And there are more.Message: ""No one is above law."" Verdict: ""Do not waste your time.""",Dredd
172,rgblakey,Judge Dredd finally gets to deliver the law his way,9,22 September 2012,"When Stallone's 1995 version of Judge Dredd hit theaters it was clear that while they managed to get a bit of the look right it really ended there. The legion of fans clamored for redemption to this brilliant comic property to get the justice it deserved. After almost 20 years Judge Dredd has returned to the big screen led by Karl Urban in Dredd 3D, but will it finally deliver the film fans have been waiting for or will it be the final judgment for a promising series? Dredd follows urban cops with the power to be judge, jury, and executioner known as Judges in the irradiated waste land of future America. When the most feared judge in the city Dredd is trapped inside a 200 story vertical slum controlled by a vicious prostitute turned drug lord, he must engage in a relentless battle alongside his rookie in training psychic judge to get them out alive. For every bad thing that came off the screen of the original cheese fest, Dredd makes up for it in blood and bullets. The story is very simple with no convoluted twists and turns, but instead a straight forward action film. If you thought the story looks like a rip off of The Raid: Redemption, you would be wrong. There are clear aspects of that idea here, but this is a different story completely. Karl Urban was born to play this role as he delivers the serious nature of the character, while still giving him a bit of humanity. The supporting cast do a great job bringing this dark bloody film together and bloody it is. This film takes full advantage of the R rating as it should have to deliver a Dredd film. There are tons of gory creative kills throughout the film that makes you feel like you are really in the world of Dredd. This is a balls to the wall gory action film that works on every level.There are some slow pacing issues here and there, but nothing that hurts the overall film. It was a bit of a bummer that its simplistic location made it feel a bit smaller, but was probably necessary to get it the gritty tone it needs for rebirth. The use of the 3D here was really only effective during the drug induced slow motion sequences, but other than that didn't add a whole lot to the overall film. Urban has a killer character on his hands if the film makes the money it deserves, so get out there and check it out so we can finally get us some Judge Death! http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey",Dredd

It brings us back, even further than that Stalone disaster Judge Dredd, and gives us that classic glimpse of a movie with a singular focus, where everything dosen't need to be wrapped up super neatly with the last 20 minutes showing us how resolved everything has been.Anyways count me in for Dredd 2, if it ever happens and Im there opening night.

174,JaydoDre,Quality action movie but rather forgetful,7,10 July 2015,"Dredd is supposed to be the good version of the Judge Dredd comic book hero, with the bad version being the Stallone's Judge Dredd from 1995. And it is good. It is true to the comic book, it is well shot, well-acted (Karl Urban in the main role). It has a cool action scene with a minigun doing some serious damage. It is quite violent. There is no standard romantic interest to speak of.The thing is, it lacks any charm. The Stallone movie was childish and cheesy but I have a fond memory of it. It was somewhat funny and charismatic. It was bad in a good way. Dredd on the other hand does not have any of that charisma. It is just a dreary professional action movie and it does not leave behind a wish to watch it again. You will pass it by when choosing movies for a movie night and say ""Oh, I remember that, that was a good movie"" and then continue browsing. It is OK though, worth a watch.",Dredd
175,blrnani,This shows what the Stallone version could have been,7,18 February 2018,"If the 1995 film hadn't catered to Roy Schneider idiocy - he managed to be even more irritating than the Joe Pesci character in the Lethal Weapon films (though to be fair to him I believe it was Sly who wanted more comedy, failing to appreciate the dry humour of the comic book series).
As I only know the comics superficially, I appreciated this film as an actioner and there's no shortage of that, although the violence may be too graphic for many audiences (eg: we see a person hitting the ground after falling over a kilometer through the air). What gave it more depth was Dredd's rookie partner, whose use of her mind reading powers was not only a powerful tool in their fight for survival but enabled her to empathise with many of the bad guys who would otherwise be regarded as disposable street trash.
I hope there are sequels, as there is plenty of ground to be explored and the topic of failing justice is topical, given the way the courts are overloaded with delaying tactics and lack of staff to handle the volume, which in turn gives the advantage to those who can afford to wait for as long as it takes. There's also the issue of law enforcement playing by rules coming up against criminals who don't abide by any rules whatsoever. And of course there's the whole notion of quick justice, dispensed by individuals who are judge, jury and executioner; a level of power that may be efficient but has enormous power to corrupt. 
But in a world where many people feel the power has swung too far the other way (how often do we hear the lament that only criminals seem to have rights?), pulling it in this direction is an attractive proposition that can be healthily explored in the cinema.",Dredd
176,thekyles99,Better than the original but it didn't take much,3,31 December 2012,"Well i know how much i loathed the original so i was very sceptical when i started to watch the reboot. Director Pete Travis must've been one of those people who was intrigued by the Stallone original as i thought if i were a director Judge Dredd would've been the last movie i would re-do. Anyhow the reboot has some qualities that make it superior although the storyline in my mind remains dead. Good eye candy i will admit this time round however the acting is 'B' level. And if you love films with constant gratuitous graphic violence then this is definitely for you. Storyline this time around has the action taking place in the far future 2070 as a new drug named 'Slo-mo' has gripped it's citizens and the head gang of 'The Cursed Earth' (Formally the States) lead by their vicious leader Madeline Madrigal (known by her followers simply as Ma-Ma) have taken over one of the low rent high rises and use it for a manufacturing plant for the drug. After Ma-Ma has three of her own drugged first and then thrown from the high rise to their deaths, Judge Dredd has been called in to investigate with new Judge recruit Cassandra Anderson (Who is also a psychic) who is to be tested here to see if she can make it to a full time Judge.It's not long before Ma-Ma learns about this and has the building locked down to avoid Dredd and his partner from escaping with one of her own and having him share everything he knows about her drug op to the other judges. The rest of the film tends to remind me of a video game where you have to battle the evil members of the drug cartel till you get to the top to battle the drug king pin herself.Although better then the original (Didnt take much) i was still not totally captiated by this film at all. It was just so-so in my books.",Dredd

I decided to give this movie a go after a friend recommended it to me and I am so glad I did.I thought it was easy to pick up the storyline and easy to follow. The action was fast paced and visually amazing. Karl Urban was fantastic in the lead role of Dredd and along with Olivia Thirlby as Judge Cassandra Anderson they made a great on screen team.I would recommend this film to anyone, whether you are a fan of Dredd or not.

178,DustinRahksi,Modern action classic.,8,8 March 2014,"The more I watch this film, and the more modern action movies I see, I have to say this film is one of the best in the last ten years. Most action movies now are just dumbed down to a common level, with actors you don't remember, even SLY and Arnold's latest films were terrible. But this film just works, the setting, the visuals, the violent world with no hope for peace, and of course Dredd laying down the law. It's not over the top and goofy or in your face like Fast 5 or something. There's no dumb comedy reliefs, instead it's very subtle, most of which coming from Dredds reactions to his surroundings and his attitude. The action is well paced, the world is dark, the characters are believable, it all fits nicely. And there is no happy ending, just another day on the job, tomorrow will be the same, but Dredd will always lay down the law. This will be remembered as a classic, in time though.",Dredd
179,axlrhodes,"Relax 2000AD fans, he keeps his helmet on and there's no Rob Schneider.",8,7 September 2012,"Seventeen years ago, a Sylvester Stallone sci-fi action vehicle was released into the world under the title 'Judge Dredd'. Based on the character from the popular 2000AD comic book series, the film was a huge disappointment with critics and a source of much heartache for Dredd devotees in the way it seemed to blatantly disregard crucial aspects of the source mythology both in look and tone. Fast forward to present day, a world in which comic book characters mean big money for film studios, surely enough time has passed to give the old Judge another crack of the whip right? I'm happy to say fans of the comic book should be able to relax and enjoy this much darker and tougher representation of their much loved character. Although the film, and it's (permanently) helmeted protagonist is a straightforward and simple beast, it actually works all the better for it. Dredd isn't given a back story or imbued with much in the way of humanity, he's instead portrayed more as the mysterious 'man with no name' whose dialogue is limited to one-liners that usually precedes some serious ass kicking. Where the 1995 Judge film was light and comedic, this version is hardcore and extremely violent with some surprising explosions of brutality meted out in a world that's long since gone to hell. As is pleasingly more and more the case in mainstream action cinema, we have strong female representation in Olvia Thirlby as Dredd's rookie sidekick and a nasty Lena Headey on form and fresh from bad girl duties in the celebrated TV series Game Of Thrones. Dredd 3D can't and won't be considered a classic of the genre, but it's a huge step-up from the Stallone version and should satisfy any and all sci-fi action fans looking for a fun Friday night thrill. Visually arresting and with a sensible running time, Dredd rocks. 3.5/5",Dredd

181,vailsy,"With a budget one quarter of Total Recall, at least twice as good",9,31 March 2013,"That achievement alone merits a perfect 10 score as far as I am concerned, but Dredd has a heck of a lot else going for it The music by Paul-Leonard Morgan is really nice, very bold and in your face throughout. Lots of mangled bass, and future sounding (see his analogsuicide interview to see how it was made) Sound design is very good too, really nice sound effects for the slo-mo drug and Dredd's bike also sounds amazing. The visual fx are extremely good quality too for the budget, and you get to see them in all their minute slowed down detail The choice of Karl Urban for Dredd was extremely inspired, although it must've been rough on him to be the star of a movie in which no one sees his face. Olivier Thirlby and Leana Headey (the wonderful Cersei Lannister from Game of Thrones) put in good performances too The story is pretty simple.. in a post apocalyptic (2000 AD) world, law and order are maintained by the 'Judges'.. basically badasses on bikes who enforce severe punishment on bad citizens. The psychic Anderson (Thirlby), a rookie trainee judge is evaluated on her first assignment by Dredd to see if she makes the grade. Choosing to investigate a crime at the Peach Trees mega tower, they find themselves locked down at the centre of a violent crime ring who are pushing a drug called Slo-Mo on citizens of the city This is a 'super hero' movie for grown ups and thank goodness we have an 18/R rating for a change. Unfortunately because of the budget we don't get to see much of Mega City 1 and spend most time locked down in one building, hopefully in the sequel...Already a cult movie. Highly recommended",Dredd
182,achyutaghosh,Raw and Stylish,8,21 September 2012,"Thank god for the Judge Dredd refresh. The 1995 version starring the mouth of Sylvester Stallone was as horrendous as it gets; a kind of parody of what the original British comic stood for. It had romance, it was cheesy, it had Stallone blabbering and it had Rob Schneider! The 2012 version is the real McCoy- tight, thrilling, along with psychotic villains and gratuitous levels of stylishly executed violence, this is one dimensional fun to the nth level.One of the biggest fallout of nuclear war is real estate- set in a dystopian era where most of the earth's remaining population post nuclear war resides in Mega City One, crime is rampant with 17,000 reported every day. All that stands between this chaos getting out of hand are the elite law enforcement officers- the Judges, who act as judge, jury and executioner. Judge Dredd, played with straightforward ruthlessness and deadpan humor by Karl Urban is a veteran judge- sees things in two colors, good and bad. He has a day out evaluating a rookie Judge Anderson played by Olivia Thirlby who has psychic abilities. While evaluating a grisly homicide replete with spilled brains and flayed skin in a 200 floor complex called Peach Trees, they come up against crazed prostitute turned drug lord Ma-Ma, played by Lena Headey who will not let them take one of her henchmen away, who can expose her underground drug operations. Curiously reminiscent of this year's The Raid Redemption, the rest of the movie is about these two judges fighting their way out through gazillions of henchmen, dispatching justice in creatively bloody ways.Karl Urban as the titular character has nothing much to work with- like in the comics, he never takes off his helmet, and we do not have a back-story on Dredd. This movie is about just another day in his life. However, Urban's portrayal is superb- he is an uber cool killing machine, oozing confidence, delivers his punch-lines well and kicks ass with style. Olivia Thirlby is the movie's emotional quotient- as a psychic, she can delve into the minds of people rendering normal interrogatory techniques archaic. And by the end of the day, she undergoes the transformation from rookie to expert. Lena Headey has portrayed evil in Game of Thrones, here she is utterly ferocious, yet never close to being unhinged. Wire fans will rejoice at Wood ""Avon"" Harris getting a meaty role as Ma-Ma's right hand man. Director Peter Travis keeps things simple- he keeps the plot, the characters, the screenplay, the action, even the running time- simple and cohesive. The trick up his sleeve is the visual depiction of the drug Ma-ma is peddling. Called Slo-Mo, it slows down the user's perception of time, and as a film-maker it lets him explore 3D's boundaries to the extremes- using slow motion capture to make brutal action sequences look dreamy, and visually arresting. The other big thing that works in Dredd's favor and happily so, is the quality of action- no holds barred, bloody- yeaah i like, i like. There isn't too much of hand to hand combat here, but the Lawgiver handgun that the judges have stand up in their own way to the Gatling guns that Ma-Ma unleashes. The Lawgivers are user coded, and voice activated- can through up a variety of projectiles. Technology finally being put to good use, i say. To sum up, Dredd is a movie in the right direction for the comic book hero. This is as R-rated violence as you will get from Hollywood. This is introductory fare i hope- budgetary constraints meant most of the movie happens in a building- it did not explore the decaying environment outside of Mega City, hopefully sequels will address that. Still, Dredd is a lot of movie for action fans- eschewing the recent trend of VFX laden PG13 action, this one is raw, and has got panache too- thats a rarity nowadays, so savor it while you can. 8/10",Dredd

A good film, but not great, but at the end of the day it's just a rip-off of The Raid. A shameless rip-off. I really think they could have been a little more creative with the franchise. My 7 is for the film as a whole. I thought it was pretty well done and Lena Heady was great, as always. My only complaint was that it's kind of weird that you never see Dredd's face. That might have been what was done in the original comic...I don't remember, but it's weird for a film to never see the actor. But I have to give the writer a 3 for just straight up ripping someone else off and being so obvious about it. If you're going to be so shameless, at least try to do a different spin on it so it doesn't scream downright theft. Not to mention, with an established brand I kind of expected there to be a little more going on than the majority of the story being sequestered to one building.

No, it's not a masterpiece. No brilliance in the story, no $200M effects budget, no complex characters. Instead, it reeks of testosterone. It smells like victory. It tastes like the good old times of Robocop and Die Hard. It feels totally uncompromised and rare in today's cinema.I like the simple construct of this movie. When ""Dredd"" begins, you're thrown straight into the story. When the story ends, the movie ends too, no hugs or aftermath. The setting is somewhat contained, smallish in scale and makes the movie intense. The small effects budget is used well, practical visual effects mixed with CGI in an interesting manner. The uniforms are wonderful and the world is bleak in just the right way. This simple story is well-paced and never gets boring. Also, ""Dredd"" doesn't pretend to be anything else, anything more than it is. It's honest and uncompromising, It's merciless and it's solid.Karl Urban has got the perfect voice and chin (with that little frown) for this character. That's right, the helmet stays on. He plays the main character in a certain wooden way that absolutely fits. I don't remember much about the comics, but I remember enough that Urban does the character justice. He's a very convincing Dredd and I loved watching him. My respect for him as an actor skyrocketed. He isn't here to promote himself. He isn't here to just ""play"" Dredd. He is Dredd. Well done, Karl. Olivia Thirlby is Anderson, Dredd's sidekick. Don't worry, because she's not a female version of Rob Schneider, a forced love interest or some useless Megan Fox. No, instead Olivia's character is useful, humane, interesting and brings a perfect contrast to Dredd - the balance is wonderful. Thirlby can act, and yes she is beautiful too. She's simply adorable. Thumbs up.Lena Headey makes an excellent villain. She's not your cardboard cutout villain, she's more like a nihilistic drug addict. The fear she strikes into her minions (especially Domhnall Gleeson's wonderfully played character) is not only believable but exciting to watch. Fine job.This movie works so well because there is nothing in it to distract you from what the movie is really about. There is nothing forced. No sentimentality, no token romance, no questioning of morals, no needless twists. On top of that, ""Dredd"" needed to be a really, really violent movie. And that's exactly what it is. It's brutally unforgiving in just the right way. It doesn't quite turn into a gore fest, but the violence is effective and very satisfying. These things alone warrant a great deal of respect. We live in a time where everything is PG13, bland and full of some moral or political propaganda (of which some people wrongly accuse Dredd). For once, we got the real thing.What are the negatives then? I don't know. I can't find any significant flaws. Perhaps the soundtrack could've been more to my personal taste, perhaps the weapons could've sounded ""bigger"", perhaps some of the CGI blood could've been done in the old-fashioned way...see? I can only think of minor gripes. I wouldn't even ask for a more ambitious storyline or a huge parade of special effects because I like how contained, simple and effective ""Dredd"" is. Director Pete Travis and Karl ""the scowl"" Urban, I owe you a beer.Dredd - no bullshit, just balls. Enjoy.",Dredd
187,troy-manatunga,"If you enjoy blood, action and superheroes; you won't be disappointed with DREDD!",6,18 February 2013,"DREDD is yet another comic book hero that has sprung to life again by the money hungry machine of the filming industry. Starring the Kiwi actor Karl Urban and Olivia Thirbly this movie is the super hero version of the Smith, Lawrence Cop flick BAD BOYS. Set in a distant future DREDD is a cop in a time where they are empowered to pass judgment on criminal offenses and even execute on sight provided it's justified. Judge Dredd first saw its light as a super hero back in the1977. His missions have carried him across many violent and corrupted cities battling corrupt adversaries. Alex Garland who is responsible for the screenplay of DREDD extracts one tower block and sets the whole 95 minutes in this tower block called the Peach Trees. This is the first good move in the screen play. Next is the plot based on the illicit drug SLOW-MO which aids director Peter Travis to explore the computer generated imagery (CGI) and to add a pinch of salt into the blood soaked movie.There indeed is a great balance in the screenplay with the inclusion of the sidekick Anderson (Olivia Thirbly). Since DREDD (Karl Urban) is deprived of an actor's most valued tool; eyes and facial expressions due to the helmet, Urban plays a very rigid cop using his body language and voice. Had it been written with no side kick, I doubt even the best of CGI could have saved DREDD from being box office dead!Yet another aspect that would further entice your entertainment senses is the light used in filming. The glum green filtered lighting settles in a perfect ambiance to the futuristic corrupt world. Each super hero has their own little back yard which elevates their presence. To Spiderman it's a city with sky scrapers, to Batman its Gotham City, to Iron Man once again it's the 21st Century cities and to DREDD it's a Star wars assorted with District 9 and I firmly believe Peter Travis nails it right in the head with his sound stage.The only thing that does not fly with me is the excess blood spillage that makes it sadly look too artificial. It's clear where the CGI team was heading with the extra detailing of gruesome violence since DREDD was released in 3D, however it's the only reason that could negate points off this movies rating. However provided that the recurrence of such artificial bloodiness is seldom seen it will indeed negate a handsome amount in my rating later on.Judge Dredd and Rookie Anderson answer a distress call in the corrupt future in a tower called Peach Trees. As the infiltrate they tower and capture a king pin of a mass drug wave the tower is locked down entrapping them within. The only option for survival is to fight until rescue arrives. Equipped with heavy body armor and once hell of a fancy gun, Dredd and Anderson steps up a notch!If you enjoy blood, action and superheroes; you won't be disappointed with DREDD!TITLE: DREDD DIRECTED BY: PETER TRAVIS STARRING: KARL URBAN, OLIVIA THIRBLY & LENA HEADEY RATED: R RATING: 06/10 RUNTIME: 95 MINUTES",Dredd
188,deastman_uk,All work and no play,6,3 October 2012,"The films job was always to put the past to bed which was never a difficult trick. We were all one in wanting a proper screen Dredd.But in reality, Stallone's Dredd was perfectly serviceable mid 90's fare - it just had few references to its source material.But after our recent massive recession, the stark British apocalyptic vision from the late 70s is somehow easier to bring to the screen.In fact the film does not quite hit all the right notes, because it works too hard to deliver an authentic comic character, and misses out on some of the humour, political playfulness and outright bizarreness.The film was cheap, but this only occasionally harmed the vision. I was reminded of how the original Clerks saved money by filming in a shop at night.I think the franchise can absorb more money and cover more of Mega City One.",Dredd
189,schroeder-gustavo,Transcends your average Action Flick,8,5 June 2015,"It's bloody, bold and has booming colors in awesome SLO-MO..need I say more? Probably. Dredd is more than your average action movie and is a prime example of a remake done right, done justice that is. The characters in this movie, although one dimensional, mostly, are strong and Karl Urban as Judge Dredd: one word: Badass! The action sequences are also performed spectacularly and, although the movie does rely on special effects, a lot, it is really enjoyable in a way most of the time. There were some parts of the movie where it is just like in your face but ultimately it is quite enjoyable. I like the fact that they show us a futuristic broken world that, although different to ours, basically has the same problems we face in society every single day. Problems like poverty, corruption and drug addiction. In the end I really enjoyed Dredd and I think it is definitely worth checking out if you like bloody action movies.",Dredd
190,sam_smithreview,compared to the Stallone version this is.....,7,23 April 2016,"Don't get me wrong, i actually enjoyed Stallone Dredd, as it was just funny, it is one of those films that is so terrible that it just makes you laugh.This Dredd is an efficient and entertaining action movie, with lots of memorable moments, kills and one-liners. I really hope that everyone goes out to see the movie, because how often do we really get an extremely violent, faithful, intelligent science fiction movie in cinemas nowadays. I also want them to make more sequels. There is so much potential for sequels, as this movie has set up the character and the scenario, and we can really get into the more epic storytelling. The story in 'Dredd' is very confined, 85% of the film takes place in one of the huge tower blocks, and I kinda wanted to see more of the city and more of Dredd's world. But for what it is, 'Dredd' is a very good movie. There are lots of action, and some truly breathtaking slow-motion sequences, that almost makes the extra price of the 3D worthwhile.Interestingly enough i feel that Dredd is one of the most complex comic characters. He is a challenging anti-hero and an uncompromising bad-ass. And don't worry, the film does not glamorize violence. People often compare Dredd to 'Dirty Harry', but Dredd is a more heroic character, because he never breaks the rules, like Dirty Harry does. He isn't a hero because he executes bad guys, but because he is incorruptible, and will always fight for what he believes is right, despite the danger of doing it. If it is right or not, the movie leaves to the audience.",Dredd
191,hoernkeem,"Dredd (2012, Pete Travis) Much darker than the Stallone campfest this iteration shows genuine promise",7,19 May 2021,"If you remember the campy Stallone vehicle from the mid 90's that had everybody screaming ""I am the law"" in that trademark Stallone almost lisp, snarl affectation then you should forget it when approaching the 2012 reboot. This film is a far cry from what that film was. This is much more gritty and realistic to a point and oh so violent. It is also very contained to a structure and in that way very reminiscent of 'The Raid' which was released just a year prior. While this film is directed by Pete Travis the real power broker here is Alex Garland who wrote and produced and by some accounts was more the director than Travis. Garland has written some great modern horror science fiction films including '28 Days Later' and 'Sunshine' before he really made a name for himself following 'Dredd' with 'Ex Machina'. Here Karl Urban picks up the role of the titular Judge Dredd with a perma-scowl and disposition to match. Olivia Thirlby stars as a fresh faced new recruit so no cumbersome helmet for the attractive ingenue. Lena Headey co-stars as ""Ma Ma"" Madrigal still channeling her inner Cersei Lannister playing a hard edged crime lord in the dystopian future.The plot here is kind of simple. Dredd is assigned this new recuit to oversee and evaluate for the day. Together they wind up chasing some felons into a megastructure which, once inside, is locked down by drug/crime kingpin Ma Ma so she can have the pesky judges dispached. For the balance of the picture the bullets fly furiously and blood is spilled and sprayed gratuitously as Dredd and charge fight their way up the skyscraper monolith to Ma Ma's doorstep which is the only logical place the fight can end. Urban delivers a solid performance as Dredd but that is not hard as not much is really asked of him as an actor in this instance. Headey proved with GoT she can do diabolically evil easily and her role here continues that trend. The action is fast and furious, and certainly violent which is better in line with the character from the comic books than the 1995 film although this hews very action oriented and steers clear of any satire or societal commentary for the most part. The action is shot well and to add to that they use a clever plot device/trick. It turns out Ma Ma is the key figure in the distribution of a drug called slo-mo which, to the user, makes time appear to slow down to a fraction of actual time thus we get more than a few sequences that are very cool visually while we see them through the eyes of someone on slo-mo. The somewhat head scratching addition here is Thirlby as the recruit Cassandra who is also a psychic. I think perhaps this was throwing out a line at a possible spin off or sequel if this were to do well because while she was utilized her role here was basically nonessential.This movie has more than a few good elements, but ultimately has the feeling of being inconsequential. Do not take that to mean I think this a bad film by any stretch. This is actual a very entertaining movie for what it is and if you enjoy violent action based movies that don't stretch your brain with too much plot then this is a perfect picture. For a thinly plotted and characterized action movie it does about as much as it can do. It lacks a certain panache or elegance throughout to enter terrain like 'John Wick' or 'The Raid' and instead winds up being a decent, but somewhat forgettable feature.Eric's Grade: B-",Dredd

193,TheFilmGuy1,"Not Quite The Raid, But Still Awesome",8,3 January 2015,"I will get the obvious out of the way. This film is obviously very similar to a film that came out earlier the same year, The Raid. While I do see many similarities that make me suspicious of claims that Dredd was written long before The Raid, I will say this film is unique enough to hold it's own. The similarities are there for sure, but it doesn't take away from this film.Dredd is a film based on a comic book that has already had a film made about it, but this film is way better than the pile of crap that is Judge Dredd (1995). It's got a gritty scifi style to it and it doesn't hold back, since its an R rated film instead of a PG 13, which they quite easily could have made it. But I am glad they made it an R rated film, cause it makes the violence more hard hitting. Also, in regards to the comparison to The Raid, this is almost completely gun play, where as The Raid is almost entirely martial arts. The visuals are really cool and unique in this. Though I do have a complaint after watching the Bluray. I noticed many issues where one shot would be nice and clear and clean looking, and when they cut to a different angle, it looked grainy. I have heard they used different cameras, and while I don't know 100%, I think this might be the issue. There were a few shots that were almost unbearably grainy and low quality looking. It felt like they didn't want to take the time to better light the shot and increased the ISO on the digital camera or something, causing the grain. Who know. Luckily when the film got interesting I put it to the back of my mind.I really enjoyed this movie. It was unique and entertaining. I must say I do prefer the Raid, even though this film seems like it had a bigger budget. The Raid is just more off the walls and insane, where as this feels like a toned down version. It's saved by it's visuals, however, and I would recommend it to people who liked The Raid.",Dredd
194,craig-hopton,Amazing but not for me,6,3 August 2014,"A really original (and successful) way of approaching a comic book/action flick - this movie focuses entirely on the events of a single day in the life of Judge Dredd.As a result it is an intense experience - it's gritty, it's detailed, it's nuanced, it speeds along seamlessly and exhilaratingly. It's also visually arresting and unashamedly violent. Dredd is well played by Karl Urban (although I did think Stallone's jawline was better suited to the over-sized helmet the Judges wear) and is accompanied by an OK performance from Olivia Thirlby as his sidekick for the day.All in all this movie is a resounding success.And yet I'm afraid it didn't win me over. Why? To be honest I think it's probably a matter of personal taste. Endless over-the-top violence rarely does it for me unless accompanied by a riveting plot line, even when done as originally and brilliantly as this. And I'm afraid this movie doesn't have a riveting plot line. It's simply a linear 'plot' about Dredd slowly overcoming the odds and closing in on his enemy. There's barely a twist or subplot to be seen.As a result I have rated Dredd 6/10 but don't be put off by that - I'm certain others will enjoy it much more than I did.",Dredd
195,jaxbubba,Better than Stallone's version.,6,28 December 2012,"Ranking #7 on the 2012 Biggest Box Office Flops of the year, 'Dredd' really isn't all that bad. Definitely much better than the 1995 Sylvester Stallone incarnation, this film is grittier, darker, and much more graphic than its predecessor. The bloody splatter factor is off-the-chart. My only complaint being that the Karl Urban Judge Dredd character played more like a 2-dimensional ""Robo-Cop"" caricature.Set in the future where the US population has swelled to 800 million and the last line of defense is the police force, ""the judges"". Instant justice is expelled on the spot. The police force is the judge, jury and executioner; and has the authority to exact sentencing immediately. Dredd (Karl Urban) is a veteran cop. He has been saddled with the responsibility of assessing the abilities of an incoming rookie cop who possesses psychic abilities. Favorite Line from the film: When asked why she wasn't wearing her helmet, Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) responds, ""The helmet can affect my psychic abilities."" Dredd retorts, ""Sure, but I think a bullet may affect them more"".Neighborhoods / communities in this future are relegated to 200-story monolithic dwellings which populate the city skyline, and were erected from the rubble of the cities to contain the overpopulation. Local gangs and drug lords rule these habitations. The unemployment rate is at 96%, and the police force can only effectively address 6% of the daily crime being reported / conducted. When three (3) known local felons are publicly executed at the Peach Trees tenancy, Judge Dredd and Anderson are called upon to investigate.Peach Trees is ruthlessly controlled by the Ma-Ma gang. Ma-Ma played callously by Lena Headey. A former prostitute, Ma-Ma, is a coldhearted killer who does not take kindly to authority, opposition, or failure. She has complete control over the Peach Trees, and she has systematically annihilated all her competitors. Peach Trees is the manufacturing hub for her #1 drug of choice, Slo-Mo. As Dredd and Anderson become aware of Ma-Ma's presence, the Peach Trees is locked down, and a fight to the death of good vs evil ensues.Again, the action sequences in this film are really top notch, and the blood splatter / Slow motion effects are off –the-chain!!! I really anticipate this film doing exceptionally well on DVD, NetFlix, On Demand, etc. I definitely believe the 18-25 male audience that this film is in dire need of finding will most certainly seek out this film on DVD. I absolutely recommend this film. It kept me entertained.See more of my reviews on FB @ ""The Faris Reel""",Dredd
196,quinnox-1,Dark and dreary,4,25 September 2012,"Not sure where the high rating is coming from, I didn't think Dredd was good or even passable. Tediously unrelenting and dreary in its tone, it felt like a long slog to sit through. The movie badly needed some comic relief or lighter moments to lift the mood. The word that most comes to mind about the performance of the main character played by Karl Urban, is ""perfunctory"". The movie felt bland and monotone with constant gunfire every few minutes or so and one dimension characters with no pizazz. Even though its running time is around an hour and a half, it felt a lot longer. The action is mostly point blank gun shots with a lot of slow motion of the bullets hitting, pretty boring and yawn-worthy. The story line is as hollow and uninteresting as the movie itself.",Dredd

198,bushtony,Dreddfully Good,7,21 December 2012,"So, this didn't exactly set the box office alight, got panned by the critics and some of the fans were disappointed. Production budget of 50 mil and worldwide gross of 30 mil marks it down as an inarguable financial flop. That sort of looks like the end of a franchise before it even begins; therefore I'm guessing a sequel is not on the cards any time soon.I'm casually aware of the comic-book character, so from my limited perspective, objectively, the film gets the framing of DREDD right. I stand to be corrected, but Urbans' Dredd is far more authentic than Stallones'. He keeps his helmet on, is not softened or compromised by political correctness or emotional conflict, snarls like Eastwood in a filthy mood and delivers justice by the book of the law without deviation. Urban is a deadpan delight and this seems to me to be the way Dredd should be represented on screen. I'm no expert or fan, but from what I recall of the 2000 AD comics, this is Dredd as Dredd should be. Or at least, as I imagine.The set up is a carbon copy of Gareth Evans' THE RAID no matter what anyone says. I doubt this was deliberate/intentional, but the fact remains that THE RAID got there first and won all the plaudits. In comparison, DREDD looks a bit like a second-stringer.Mega City One is well-realised on screen and the visual FX impress as generally well rendered. There is no skimping on the action and violence. The film makers could have toned down the splatter and gore, but all credit to them they didn't take that route. This is not diluted, neutered or diminished to snag a kiddie-friendly rating (BATMAN, TAKEN 2, JACK REACHER, et al). I appreciate them sticking to their guns and holding true to their vision. But in so doing they may have sacrificed a wider audience. That's the risk you take.The trippy slo-mo effects might be a turn off for some, but I found them extremely compelling and dynamic – like Peckinpah on LSD. Likewise the oppressive and dour tone that pervades throughout. This is, after all, a dystopian future – what did people expect, rainbows and lollipops?Good pulsing pulp sci-fi entertainment that deserved a wider audience, more attention and less whining detraction.",Dredd
199,toqtaqiya2,Impressive action and special effects make Dredd a remake that works.,5,2 October 2012,"Dredd is a straightforward science-fiction action film with Karl Urban in the leading role of the dreaded judge. The film grabs you at the beginning and doesn't let go until the end. No question about it, Dredd is a very entertaining film. In the vast dystopian metropolis of Mega-City One Judge Dredd takes out the criminals like trash. Urban gives it his all in a role in which he didn't take off the helmet for the duration of the film. Paired with him is Olivia Thirlby as Judge Cassandra Anderson, a cute attractive rookie with powerful psychic abilities. Just like Urban Thirlby is in top form here. Placed against them is Lena Headey as Madelaine Madrigal, a seriously vile drug lord. Her antics make the viewer wish that Dredd would take her out as soon as possible. The action here is almost non-stop. Sometimes, when the drug Slo-Mo is used, the action is slowed down for an interesting visual effect. Praise should go to cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle because the visuals alone make the film worth seeing. Despite all this Dredd adds almost nothing new to the action genre. It has a thin plot and the characters are certainly not multi-dimensional. And even though the story takes place in a post-apocalyptic future the sci-fi elements are barely present. Still, Dredd is an exciting actioner with a high body count. I recommend seeing it.",Dredd
200,WatchedAllMovies,an incredible stupid plot hole,4,14 January 2013,"This movie is about cops (or judges) battling drug gangs in a futuristic time frame.To make the story more interesting, a female rookie judge was added who could read minds.The rest of the movie is about how these two judges battle a building full of drug gangs.This is a typical hero type movie where the heroes are never hit by gun fires. Although somewhat predictable, it is interesting enough to watch that I finished the DVD in two sittings without skipping anything.Unfortunately, overall this movie is a failure due to a plot hole -- why didn't the gang members used the slow motion drug before fighting? It would have given them unbeatable reaction time. This plot hole is so big I consider it an insult, and I'm lowering my initial rating.There are other plot holes, like the rookie didn't wear helmet because it interfered with her mind reading power. But how could she read the mind of another people wearing helmet?When mama was threw out of the window, why didn't she immediately detonate the building?",Dredd
201,dharmendrasingh,He hands out death sentences for fun,8,4 October 2012,"Skilfully imagined by director Pete Travis, humorously scripted by Danny Boyle favourite Alex Garland and bleakly (but beautifully) photographed by Oscar winner Anthony Dod Mantle, 'Dredd' is a superb comic book adaptation – one of the best yet. I didn't want to make notes. I put down my pad, stretched out wide in my chair and had my popcorn in easy reach. 'Dredd' is the sort of thrill ride I haven't experienced in a while. A future America, called Mega-City One, is a post-apocalyptic wasteland, a hotbed for crime and disorder. In this drug-ridden dystopia of towering tower blocks and grimy slums, Judges (police officers with on-the-spot judiciary powers) patrol the streets, able to respond to only 6% of felonies. That's hardly scratching the surface when there are 17,000 every day. Karl Urban inherits the role of Judge Dredd from Sylvester Stallone. He plays the role with the same snarling and ruthlessness, but there isn't really much range in a role like this. Except that we're made to sympathise and care for him without knowing his history, or what his motivations for his Sisyphean profession are, or even what he looks like (Urban never once lifts his helmet, ensuring a level of mystique we never had with Sly's portrayal). Dredd is assigned a rookie, Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) to assess for field eligibility. A genuine psychic, Anderson is considered a valuable asset to Mega-City's understaffed police force, but is mistrusted by Dredd for being three points short of the entrance exam pass mark ('Still a fail', as he so impassively puts it). Thirlby contradicts the rookie stereotype by demonstrating an equal readiness to dispense death. Dredd tells Anderson to select which crime they should attend to. She chooses a triple-homicide in a high-rise controlled by vicious prostitute-turned drug lord (lady?) Ma-Ma (Lena Heady), who secured her infamy by doing what Tim Robbins threatened he'd do to the Sisters in 'The Shawshank Redemption'. Ma-Ma is not a villain to be trifled with. The three men were skinned alive, force-fed a new drug called 'slo-mo' which tricks the brain into believing time is moving slower than it does, and thrown over a hundred floors to their deaths. Anderson couldn't have picked a more dangerous case: Ma-Ma locks down her 'megablock' and orders the residents to vanquish them. The violence is stylish; gratuitous but gratifying. There are moments that shock, but noticing the nuances in the manner of deaths is all part of the fun. Dredd has the most versatile gun I've ever seen. All he has to do is whisper a word and it fires like an automatic, or dispenses grenades. The dark and moody atmosphere sustains the tension. If you ever played the controversial video game 'Manhunt', you'll know what I mean. You never know how Dredd and Anderson will make it out of Ma-Ma's 200-storey building, if at all. CGI necessarily abounds, though it is employed assiduously, ensuring that we become completely absorbed in this world without questioning the surroundings. Being a psychic, Anderson could surely predict the outcome of their day. But if she did that, there wouldn't be a film. This is an ultra-violent comic book film. Judge it on visuals and style, nothing else. www.moseleyb13.com",Dredd
202,EmmaDinkins,Chix Chat on Film Review: A new kind of Dredd,6,22 September 2012,"Dredd is a futuristic view of law enforcement where the officers of the courts are judge, jury and executioners. Not unlike Stallone's Judge Dredd which seems to have occurred after the events of this story. I watched intently to try and establish a connection to the two films, and decided that since the landscape was not nearly as dilapidated, this must be some prequel and maybe this Dredd (Karl Urban) was the prototype for the latter. This film shows how when dealing with crime the more things change, the more things stay the same. Dredd has a training day (pun intended) with a rookie judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) who doesn't quite qualify to be a judge but is being evaluated due to special circumstances. As shown in the trailer they are placed in a hostile situation based on responding to crimes committed at a site called Peach Trees, which is home to a megalomaniac with the pseudonym Ma-Ma (Lena Headey). Sersei looked awful, having a son like Joffrey has severely taken its tollno wait, her role here is in Dredd. This whole scenario reminded me of the Nino Brown takeover of the Carter in New Jack City for a number of reasons, but mostly because it was based on crimes focused on a new drug called slow-mo. Remember that new drug of the 80's called crack? The primary difference of course was that the setting was some bleak time in the future that didn't seem that far off, except for the fact that there was a population of 800 million in the city. It would reasonably take generations to get from now to then. This was the most depressing view of the future that I've seen in a while. Law enforcement would have to reinvent itself in a community where people are stacked on top of themselves. Which has to be why the role of executioner seemed to top the list of responsibilities of a judge, the body count and violence was exceedingly high. And speaking of high, the only time the 3-D effects were most prevalent was to emulate the effects of slow-mo with pretty little sparklers slowly wafting off the screen. Honestly, the premium price of 3-D was not necessary to get the full effect of the bullets flying through body parts or for the effects of slow-mo. I did not have real expectations for this film, but it wasn't Dreddful, so I'm giving it an amber light.",Dredd

Needless to say, that didn't matter at all. I enjoyed this action film a lot more than I thought I would.The action is there and the ""slo mo"" was a nice little extra element to the action scenes. It was almost like a video game as far as the story is concerned. Dredd and his rookie who is along for the ride get trapped in a building and have a big price on their heads.There are some funny one liners and the acting isn't bad at all either.

204,HaddonfieldJason,A dangerous precedent,1,3 October 2012,There is an element of comic book fans who see these pulp stories as an outlet of expression for very deranged and violent views. There has to be something subconscious beneath the surface of the comic book. All of them advocate vigilantism and a near fascist interpretation of maintaining law and order and I suppose Judge Dredd is just this theme at it's utmost extremity. Dredd 3D is a depressing movie and the fact that someone tried to pass this as an entertainment is completely irresponsible. This character has no redeeming quality. What ever entertainment comes from this film is from the audiences getting titillated from very gruesome scenes. Why would anyone want to subject themselves to this? There isn't any tongue in cheek quality to Dredd 3D and so the film is composed of brutality and a reprehensible view of the world that it takes way too seriously. I think anyone who would like this has to be mentally ill. I am glad the film tanked at the box office because it shows that there is some hope in what people find in their entertainment. Dredd seems to still be generating a fan base though and that is worrisome.,Dredd
205,maxmages,Judgment is coming. She's a pass.,8,26 April 2018,"Dredd (2012) is a super great movie that really sets itself apart from other action movies in both design and filming. I also think it's great that there is no love interest here.
but have a completely straightforward story with very small clichés and the occurrences are over quickly so we focus on the important thing. The movie stands out from other action movies for both the looks and the violence. I'm glad to finally have a movie for adults and I mean visually as well as physically and psychologically.
I can do without the 3D but the computer effects the slowmotion and the colors are just unique that I would like to immerse in this movie the music goes through my head and leg and the end surprised even me so I thought when I saw the movie I would have to get up to applaud.",Dredd
206,Caleb_Everett,Need More Dredd,8,19 February 2019,"In this remake, we see a lot of over the top action that is absolutely CALLED for.It's rare that I watch a movie where I elate in the action sequences being slow and drawn out, but in Dredd, the sequences involving Slo-Mo are absolutely beautiful. I was almost in awe of every moment and could completely if just for a second, understand why someone would want to partake in that drug. This version takes a more comic book approach to the franchise, having Dredd never take his helmet off and being a sterner ""Judge"".I was originally unsure on how I would feel about this remake, being a large Stallone fan and having loved the first as a child, but after 30 minutes into this film I was completely bought in and loved the change of pace from the first one.This movie is not family friendly, but it's definitely worth watching and I'm sure I'll watch it again.",Dredd

When it came out most of us saw Judge Dredd with Sylvester Stallone and feared that it was going to be the same and we couldn't have been more wrong. It is the complete opposite. At release of both films I had no knowledge of the comics. I do have a little now and understand why the comic fans hated it more than the rest of us. I gave it a 10 because if you're seeing this in 2021 or whenever after and have yet to see Dredd? Maybe that 10 will be what gets you to press play. You'll be happy if you like action, dark, gritty, and violent films.",Dredd

Dredd should be stylish (it is a graphic novel after all), violent (come on, it's Dredd!) and light on dialogue but heavy on action. Voila...Dredd delivers. Sure, the plot is a rip-off from The Raid (a true action classic) but who cares when it's executed this good? The film looks great, especially the so-called Slo Mo shots, and delivers what it needs and expects to do. Plus: Dredd keeps on his helmet.",Dredd
209,InaneSwine,One of the best comic-book-based films this side of the millennium,9,20 February 2016,"Dredd failed at the box office for two reasons: the studio's forcing most cinemas to show it almost exclusively in 3D; and its adult age rating, which cut out a wide section of the audience it was aimed at. Fortunately, as with most box office tallies, the figures are not a reflection of its quality, as it is quite possibly one of the best comic-book-based films this side of the millennium. As opposed to a blah, watered-down, squeaky clean 12A certificate product, Dredd is a bracing, brutal, dark and disturbing action thriller.We are shown a vision of the future that is a frightening parallel to our world, where the poverty-stricken and least-educated are forced into an existence besieged by drugs and violence. While that's clearly the point that Garland's screenplay attempts to make, the darkness and nihilism of Dredd's world is so brilliantly realised on camera that one often forgets that we're looking at another world. Karl Urban is a menacing hulk; Olivia Thirlby unpretentiously confronts Dredd's blind upholding of barbaric laws; Lena Headey's performance makes for an uncomfortable watch, as her maniacal character embodies the lonely, scarred and depressed psychopaths of our world; and Domhnall Gleeson is underrated as the damaged, sympathetic victim.As an action movie, Dredd successfully imitates the riotously fun aspects of 18-rated films from the late 80s and 90s. However, what they lack in character, story and brains, Dredd fully makes up for.",Dredd
210,caseymoviemania,Casey's Movie Mania: DREDD (2012),7,23 September 2012,"Mention the word ""Dredd"" or ""Judge Dredd"", that Stallone's embarrassingly awful movie instantly comes to mind. For decades (17 years, to be exact), no other studios has dared to resurrect the franchise ever since until a new development has finally seen the light of its day when it was first announced on 20 December 2008 as an independent movie project. At the first glance, I was skeptical for the new ""Judge Dredd"" movie, titled as DREDD, when the studio (DNA Films) hired director Pete Travis (2009's VANTAGE POINT) to helm the project. After all, Pete Travis isn't the kind of name that immediately springs to mind for to take over such a beloved comic-book character. But thankfully, Travis and screenwriter Alex Garland has (mostly) succeeded what Stallone has failed back in 1995 -- they get the somber brutality tone right. Just like the comic book itself, DREDD is undeniably gritty and ultra-violent sci-fi actioner that will surely please a lot of fanboys and like-minded audiences who prefers their R-rated genre movie.At the beginning of the movie, we learn that the future America is reduced to an irradiated wasteland known as the ""Cursed Earth"". The only place inhabitable located on the east coast of North America called ""Mega-City One"" -- a vast metropolis that housed 800 million residents and patrolled by members of an all-powerful police force (judge, jury and executioner) known as Judges. These Judges are bestowed with responsibility of executing life-or-death sentence immediately at the scene of a crime. Among the famous Judges of all, is the hard-edged lawman named Judge Dredd (Karl Urban). He is tasked by Chief Judge (Rakie Ayola) to evaluate rookie Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), an Academy underachiever who has an amazing ability of psychic power.When Dredd and Cassandra chooses to investigate a triple-homicide in a high-rise building, they find themselves engaging against a ruthless drug lord nicknamed Ma-Ma (Lena Headey), a former prostitute who rules with an iron fist over the 200-storey slum tower block known as ""Peach Trees"". They also subsequently discover that the three dead bodies are actually being skinned alive before infused by Slo-Mo -- an addictive drug capable of slowing the user's perception of time to 1% -- before being thrown off from the top of the tower. They proceed to investigate the case further, and arrest Kay (Wood Harris), one of Ma-Ma's henchmen, after Anderson psychically detects his involvement with the murders. Before they even manage to remove Kay out of the tower for interrogation, Ma-Ma orders her men to seize the tower's security control room and seal the place using its blast shields under the pretense of a security test. With no way out, the two Judges are trapped inside without outside help and they're on their own. As Ma-Ma demands both Judges to be killed, they have no choice but to fight back all the way up.If the story sounds familiar, it is because Alex Garland's script has (coincidentally -- or is it?) shared the similarity of this year's Indonesian action hit, THE RAID: REDEMPTION. But unlike that movie, the pace in DREDD is surprisingly erratic, especially given its DIE HARD-like premise. Whereas the movie is supposed to be a straightforward and fast-paced actioner, Garland has thrown a lot of fats inside his threadbare script that constantly ruins the momentum.Still, the movie remains entertaining enough, thanks to Karl Urban's perfectly-minimalistic portrayal as Judge Dredd. Unlike Stallone's awkward performance which borderlines into self-parody, Urban spends all the time acting behind his ever-present helmet (at last!). It's really a tough act, but Urban manages to pull it off with genuine flair. His blunt charisma and deadpan humor makes him a perfect Judge Dredd character that reminds me of Clint Eastwood's ""Man With No Name"" and ""Dirty Harry"" character. Elsewhere, Olivia Thirlby, who is primarily known for her acting work in indie movies, fares equally well as Cassandra. She's a perfect balance against the emotionless Judge Dredd, and she also convincing during some of her action-packed moments. However, Lena Headey is quite disappointing as the supposedly vicious Ma-Ma. Sure, she has the ugly scar in her face that makes her intimidating but her portrayal is somewhat undermined. Her final scene, where she confronts Judge Dredd at the top of the tower, is especially a letdown. Considering in the earlier movie where she is depicted how ruthless she is, it's a surprise the way she chooses to fight against Judge Dredd, is -- anticlimactic.On the technical level, the movie is top-notch. Even though it's only blessed with a modest $45 million budget, Travis manages to deliver enough memorable visual feast here to satisfy the genre fans. The ""Slo-Mo"" sequences are especially eye-catching -- e.g. Bullet tears through the faces, blood burst from the wound, and water droplets suspended in the air -- all beautifully executed in balletic slow-motion. Imagine Sam Peckinpah or John Woo, but further enhanced in a precision level, you'll get the idea. Thanks to the surrealistic touch by cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, those sequences are truly a sight to behold. Production designer Mark Digby also does a good job on creating the grungy feel of the 200-storey ""Peach Trees"" tower block. The action, in the meantime, are well-executed that doesn't skimps on gore and violence. Not to forget also, is Paul Leonard-Morgan's throbbing and addictive electronic score that perfectly accompanied the grungy tone of the movie.Overall, it's a huge relief that DREDD is a good, if not perfect antidote that erases the painful memory of Stallone's poor version. A few setbacks aside, I sure hope that Garland's intended trilogy will come true if this first movie manages to make enough money at the box office.",Dredd
211,leoxatzian,Largely unappreciated.,7,28 April 2020,"With a plot that greatly benefits from it's simplicity, gripping characters brought to life through some really spot on performances and action that is just as awesome as it is unapologetically gory, ""Dredd"" delivers on everything it promises viewers. The movie effectively sells you on it's futuristic dystopian world thanks to clever cinematography, imaginatively gritty set design and the fact that both the heroes and the villains feel like two sides of the same coin. Overall, this makes for a gripping, blood drenched and action packed comic book movie that definitely deserves ninety minutes of your time.",Dredd
212,tomrito,"Wow, finally a good 3D Sci-Fi",10,21 September 2012,"This is a very well made Sci-Fi action movie that is both entertaining and visually stimulating. I have not been a fan of the 3D movies that have come out recently, but this one is actually worth the few extra dollars. The action is non-stop and although the budget was not huge, they make the best what they have. I give this movie a ""10"" not because it is a masterpiece, or because the plot or science is brilliant, but because of how well the movie was made in 3D and how believable the acting was. Karl Urban goes through the whole movie without us ever seeing his face. (For an actor that must have been hard. You are going to be the lead actor but no one will ever see your face.) But he does a great job and makes all the macho one-liners sound good. Olivia Thirlby plays the rookie judge, with special powers, very effectively, not over the top but a good contrast to the machine like Dredd. Also, she gets to keep the helmet off, which is a good thing. And although the script is thin, the direction, the action and the 3D visuals, more than make up for it. It is not for kids or the weak of hart, but if you are a Sci-Fi fan, go see this movie now.",Dredd
213,jonnytheshirt,How Dredd-full it flopped at the box office.,8,26 November 2012,"Dredd is an action movie from a comic that has really tried to stick with the source material. In fact the movie plays out like a comic, like an episode of Dredd - the story is limited in its scope but epic in it's action and the characters evolve throughout it (as much as Dredd himself can). I left the movie theatre generally thrilled with what I'd seen, the 3D and Slo-Mo worked better visually than most any other 3D movie I've ever seen (with the exception of Avatar which is on a league of it's own and has been there alone ever since). It's gritty and violent and pretty much down Dredd street and a thousand Miles from the Stallone debacle. The special surprise was Olivia Thirlby, she nailed the role being a cracking opposite Urban's stoic one-liner Dredd. I really think this girl was not marketed more in this movie, and Lena Hedley also put in a star baddie performance. The reason why it flopped in the box office is another tale not for here. The only downside is a bit more of the tech and colour and madness of the comics could have fleshed out a rather gritty depiction but for any comic book movie type fan, Class A movie.",Dredd
214,drew_atreides,"A solid, gritty adaptation of the Judge",7,21 September 2012,"...just got back from seeing this one...I wasn't sure what to expect going in... Was trying to keep my expectations tapered... Have to say I came out having enjoyed the new DREDD 3D (which i must confess i did NOT see in 3D.) The performances and chemistry of the 2 leads is really what wins the day in this otherwise low-budget but well-made production. Karl Urban and Olivia Thirlby really click as the grizzled Dredd and the Rookie Anderson. The relationship there was really fun to watch. Urban really nails the character, and that's really what it's all about. There's some good music, and some nice fx, given the budget.You could definitely do worse, as an action fan!",Dredd

About the sordid, pervasive ugliness of the world, the garish, lurid cinematography, the grinding nihilism, the repetitive video-game plot, the fetishized power-violence, the influx of stupid characters seemingly incapable of expressing themselves in ways that don't involve F-bombs... And the only meager pleasures to be had involving Dredd's admittedly funny lower-facial expressions.It's even worse than Michael Bay, because at least Bay's first foray into science fiction, The Island, was more interesting and even more satirical than this. The violent Arnold/Stallone films of the 80s and 90s, (which this movie is trying to ape), were at least imaginative and engaging (Total Recall, the Running Man, etc) and went full blown into their inherent cheesiness.This is just trash.",Dredd

It's an action flick that gets better with every viewing.Dredd barely slows down for a second throughout yet the characters are developed well. Karl Urban portrays Dredd superbly, Olivia Thrilby plays a believable female action heroine as the rookie Anderson, but for me the scene stealer is Lena Headly as ma-ma. I've often been critical of female heroines and villians not because I have anything against female characters but because more often they simply arent believable. Brie Larsens God awful portrayal of Captain Marvel or Kate Blanchetts Hela being a cases in point.Lena Headlys ma-ma though could not have been played better by anyone, male or female. She is truly menacing, cold and just simply frightening. Any decent action movie needs a good villian to make it work and Dredd works because it has an excellent one.Add in the action sequences, the direction, pacing, music, the 3D visuals and you have for me one of the best action movies in recent years.",Dredd
217,evan_harvey,A poor rip-off of The Raid: Redemption,5,19 November 2012,"The short: better than I thought, but still crap.The long: As the title of my review notes, the story is a complete rip-off of the much better recent Indonesian film ""The Raid: Redemption"".In ""The Raid: Redemption"", a group of police storm an apartment block controlled by a criminal kingpin. In Dredd 3D, a pair of police officers are trapped in an apartment block controlled by a criminal kingpin.In ""The Raid: Redemption"", the criminal kingpin tells the residents of the apartment block to hunt down the police officers. In Dredd 3D, the criminal kingpin tells the residents of the apartment block to hunt down the police officers.""The Raid: Redemption"" managed to create an apartment block full of murderous killers. By contrast, Dredd 3D has an apartment block full of about 50 murderous killers, so I guess that's a difference.There's some embellishments like a rookie cop (also similar to ""The Raid: Redemption"") and a psychic (that really seemed unnecessary), but it hardly makes any difference.Urban appeared to be trying to channel Clint Eastwood, but has neither the voice, charisma, nor the script to pull it off. He mostly just sounded kind of lame. His pithy one-liners were not only dull, but delivered so painfully that one wonders what brain-dead monkey wrote such a crappy script (his name is Alex Garland).Lena Headey seems to be trying to channel some Cersei from Game of Thrones, but fails miserably, as both a killer and a tactician. She just seems to scowl and swear, and you're left wondering who would give their allegiance to such a weak leader.On the upside, while the script is largely devoid of any real substance, it is quite brutal, and Dredd is suitably hardcore. He kills people (although the director chose not to show a lot of it so some bizarre reason), and dispenses justice in the form of on-the-spot executions.The SFX are pretty good. The soundtrack is very good (very moody and industrial). The script is uninspired and devoid of tension. The plot is empty. The acting non-existent. The direction average.So. It was better than I thought, but ultimately only more proof that Hollywood can't even rip off a good film properly. 5 out of 10 for lack of imagination.",Dredd
218,Treyroo,Outshines its predecessor to a startling degree,7,6 December 2012,"You're being hunted, outnumbered, you're unable to escape. To make matters worse, your only ally is inexperienced and you have a prisoner whose safety is your responsibility. What do you do?The majority of the United States is now uninhabitable, thanks to radiation. Those areas are referred to as The Cursed Earth. Mega-City One, one of the habitable areas, is a large violent metropolis containing close to one billion people and suffering 17,000 violent crimes a day. The only bulwark maintaining some semblance of order is the greatly outnumbered Judges. Despite their name, they perform the same tasks as police officers in addition to carrying out the duties of determining guilt and imposing sentence. One such man is Judge Dredd (played by Karl Urban). Dredd (Urban) is well-known among his fellow Judges for his uncompromising nature and stiff sentences. Against his will, Dredd is ordered by his superior to evaluate a young officer who failed her exams but was offered the chance to be a Judge because of her psychic abilities, caused by the radiation and making her part of a societal caste referred to as ""mutants"". The young rookie (played by Olivia Thirlby) is named Cassandra Anderson and, while Dredd wears a helmet throughout the entire film, she elects not to for fear that it will inhibit her psychic abilities. Simultaneously, in a 200- story slum referred to as The Peach Trees, a crime boss named Madeline Madrigal, also known as Ma-Ma, (played by Lena Headey) has three men drugged, skinned, and dropped from a high floor in The Peach Trees. Dredd and Anderson are informed via radio and arrive at the scene to investigate. Anderson's psychic abilities allow her to identify one of the perpetrators almost immediately, causing Dredd to take the man into custody so he can be interrogated back at the Judges' headquarters. Something Ma-Ma cannot allow. And the hunt begins.Now, I have seen the seen the 1995 Sylvester Stallone movie which was inspired by the same source material. In fact, I've seen it many times. I'm not proud of it, but it's true. While this film doesn't explore Dredd's origins or allow the same ""growth"", I'd say Dredd succeeded where its predecessor failed. No, it doesn't have Rob Schneider to offer comic relief or Diane Lane and Joan Chen as strong and attractive female characters, but the cat-and-mouse game Headey's character and the illustration of the drug referred to as Slo-Mo more than compensate. It doesn't break new ground or challenge the actors, save for Headey who is forced to appear unattractive on screen for the first time in her career, but it is highly entertaining and I enjoyed it a great deal.",Dredd
219,moviemaniac008,Dredd,9,11 November 2012,"I checked Dredd out of curiosity one evening. Having never seen the ''Judge Dredd'' with Stallone and having only heard negative stuff about it, I will not compare the two together. But all I can say is that the 2012 Dredd is simply put, an amazing action film.Dredd tells us a story of a violent city in the near-future where cops have the right to kill criminals on the spot depending on the severity of their offences. The main character, ''Dredd'' (Karl Urban), has a rookie for the day, a telepath by the name of Anderson (Olivia Thirlby). On her first training assignment, Dredd and Anderson must inspect a murder scene at a residential sector ran by Ma-Ma (Lena Heady). As soon as they arrive, the building is put on lock down, and the cops must shoot their way to the top if they want to survive.The story of Dredd shares many similarities to ''The Raid: Redemption'', but don't be afraid of paying to see the same film: both shine in their respective ways. The Raid was all about awesomely-choreographed fight scenes, some of which were pretty brutal. Dredd on the other hand, appeals more to a modern American audience who wants a typical point-and-shoot type of action film. Dredd shines in delivering a simple story that still manages to keep the viewer interested in it all movie long.As the lead character, Urban is amazing, while his co-star Thirlby is also very good. The two main leads have a great chemistry together. To all those skeptical of Urban, do not worry, for the Dredd character fits him perfectly. I think that Dredd is probably one of the most epic character I've seen on the big screen this year, slightly behind Tom Hardy's Bane.The action is amazingly shot. Director Pete Travis shows very good usage of slow-motion, which can lead to certain parts to be very intense. Speaking of intensity, Dredd never shys itself of showing blood and gore, and is very worthy of it's R-rating. So if you're sick of all the PG-13 action films like for example, Taken 2, this movie is really for you.I had no choice but to see it in Real D-3D. How was the 3-D you ask? In my opinion, it was pretty good. I probably wouldn't have paid for it if I had the choice, but what I got was pretty solid. The scenes with the drug, SLO-MO in particular are very well made, especially with 3D. As the name of the drug implies, you get those scenes in slow-motion, and those slow-motion scenes are usually largely propelled by 3D. If it's not too late, if Dredd still plays in a local theatre near your house, then do yourself a favour and rush out to go see it. It's very well worth your time and I'm still thinking about it a month after I've seen it. Definitely going to buy the Blu-Ray to watch it again and again.",Dredd

221,akshay-ak-kumar,Dredd Rocks !!,7,8 October 2013,"The trailers of Dredd caught my attention last yr and I was keen to watch it in theatres in India. However, it had a limited release and I was unable to watch it. Most of the critics in India gave it good reviews and I'm not surprised as to why.Dredd set in the future where Judges are law as well as executioners. A no nonsense law enforcer with a frown forever on his face.Dredd and a rookie called Anderson enter a high rise building to resolve on a homicide but it becomes a death trap set by drug lord Ma-Ma. The movie simple plot is how they escape. The best of the movie is the action set pieces which are not over the top. The writing is crisp and whenever there is a moment when we feel the movie might drag, a small twist ensures to keep us hooked. The photography especially when the drug 'Slo Mo' is inhaled is beautifully shot. The only point in the film which I disliked is the depiction of violence. Killing is fine but scenes where people are skinned or blinded was a bit too much. The women are top form. Thirlby and Headey are fine form. Thirlby plays the rookie with psychic powers beautifully and Headey is deliciously as the devil Ma Ma. Karl Urban is impressive as Dredd. His performance reminded me of the early movies of Indian Legend Amitabh Bachchan where he successful portrayed the angry young man. Hope Urban gets better roles in the future and through this movie, he proves that he a capable leading man.Hope there is a sequel of Dredd which I'll await for. And this movie is far far better than the crap starting Stallone.",Dredd
222,twilliams76,Forget that dreadful 1995 adaptation and watch this!,6,7 January 2013,"Visually stylish and thoroughly entertaining in a very good B-movie kind of way, the 2012 film version of Dredd -- based upon the British comic Judge Dredd -- is worlds apart from the disastrously cheesy 1995 film version starring Sylvestor Stallone.In this version (forget the other one!), Karl Urban (Red, Star Trek) dons the futuristic Judge's mask while he takes a new recruit (Olivia Thirlby - Juno, United 93) under his wing as he investigates the source of a new deadly, reality-bending drug called Slo-Mo that might be linked to criminal queenpin Ma-Ma (Lena Headey - ""Game of Thrones"", 300) and her motley crew.While both bloody and very violent, the camera work in Dredd does something quite remarkable by making the gore-y imagery become graphically poetic. Dredd captures some unbelievably beautiful images on screen in some very grisly, slow-motion scenes. I am not one who seeks out violence on screen (although it does NOT bother me) as I will watch anything; but I can see some being turned off by the high level and intensity of some of the action on display in Dredd.As for the acting -- Urban as the stalwart defender never falters and Ma-Ma is one of the slinkiest, most skin-crawl-inducing baddies I have seen on screen in some time (few can leer and sneer as good as Headey).Dredd is not a ""pleasant"" surprise -- as it is very gritty -- but it IS a surprisingly good romp that I would recommend to my friends who like action spectacles.",Dredd

224,stephenstephenbyrne,Simple action done right,7,31 January 2021,"Really into the style of this movie. Most of the risks they take visually pay off well. The brighter spaced out hues of colour, heck even the (usually dreaded) slow-mo works great here. It's just a fun action flick that's also 90 mins long (always a plus) with a decent performance from Lena Headey.Where the film drops the ball a bit though is the satire, or lack of satire should I say, with regards to its characters and world. Given the current world we live in, it's a bit hard to stomach a future where police officers are judge, jury and executioner, presented as straight as this is. And I know people say the original comic is indeed satire but there wasn't much sign of that here. You basically have this abjectly poor facist dystopia, and cops are getting on peoples cases and locking them up for recreational drug use or being homeless? Hell I would probably be doing drugs if I was in that environment. The system of government the Judges enforce and uphold directly rule over this crap world they live in but they never really explore that in any meaningful way. The film never really questions what the Judges do. And I think you need to do that in a film like this, it needs that nuance. That for me would have been the extra dimension that turns this film from a really good movie into a great movie.Sure they hint at the fact that mayyybe the villain might be the way she is due to the world she grew up in but then they make her a murdering sociopath who plows down entire families of innocent people so any sense of nuance or empathy around that point is lost.That criticism withstanding I would still definitely recommend this. On a technical and breezy action level it's really good.",Dredd
225,drawlife,Awesome violence.,8,27 August 2014,"Wow. This movie had awful trailers, but I was still interested because I was aware of the Dredd comic and I thought to myself it can't be worse than the original Dredd film we got, so I should give a chance. I'm happy to report that this movie is great. This film is beautifully violent. I saw this in 3D when it was released and I'm not a giant 3D fan, but the film looked great. Especially the ""Slow-Mo"" scenes. It was quite a surprise that I found myself really entertained by it. Karl Urban, who has previously stood out for his excellent turn as Dr. McCoy in the Star Trek franchise, is not afraid to go through an entire movie with a helmet on, he is spot on as Dredd. He gives us an emotionless machine, a man who cares for nothing but the law, a man who is truly incorruptible, but also a man you want to get behind and cheer on as he splats bad guys left and right. The humanity comes from Anderson, and it helps that Olivia Thirlby doesn't have to wear a helmet herself, with the handy excuse that it interferes with her special abilities. Between them they give us the tired old veteran and a rookie on the streets for the first time, and you sympathize with the life of a Mega City Judge. Lena Headey does a great job in her villainous role as Ma-Ma. She's not too over the top, but she is very despicable in the film. Headey does a great job at being a bitch you just can't wait but to see her get taken down by Dredd. Is this a movie you go for a deep, moving story, no. But I can tell you what this film does well is making you, as the audience care for these two judges. Something typical action, shoot- em-up thrillers almost always lack. It's a shame that this film didn't generate enough buzz and make enough money. I would have loved to see more of Dredd's story continue. It's a well made film that redeems itself while also making you forget about the Slyvester Stallone's take on Dredd. 8.8/10",Dredd

It's one of the most violent films I have ever seen, doesn't pretend to be what is isn't, can be truly funny when it wants to be, and is extremely impressive visually. This is a film meant to entertain, and, as long as you can stomach it, will do exactly that for each of its ninety-six minutes. Dredd (portrayed by Karl Urban's chin wearing the iconic helmet), couldn't embody totalitarianism any more if he tried. The first criminal he ""tries,"" he gives two choices: life in jail or a bullet to the head. He cannot be negotiated with, does not show pity or remorse, and and can kill scores of men without hesitation in the name of the law. This, of course, never changes throughout the film, so it is down to a young psychic (Olivia Thirlby) to be the arc-worthy character. While it is somewhat interesting to see her go from guilt-ridden young girl to killing machine, that's not hat this movie is here for. What it's here for is to provide audiences with some of the most brutally spectacular action ever seen in cinema. The plot is as follows: Dredd and co. vs. an entire skyscraper's worth of bad guys. Said bad guys are in the business of distributing a drug called ""slow-mo,"" which does exactly as its name suggests. This provides a good excuse for some absolutely beautiful slow-mo shots of everything from water splashing to heads exploding. After the first half-hour or so, the film becomes little more than a visually arresting ballet of blood and bullets. This is an action film in the truest sense, and nothing more. There's really not that much left to say about it. If you can't stomach gore, don't even consider going. If you don't find spectacular violence entertaining, don't consider going. If neither of these apply to you, you won't be disappointed.",Dredd
228,cmoyton,Robocop 4,1,2 February 2013,"Probably the best sic fi movie you have seen if you are fourteen years old. Yes it has near identical plot and setting to The Raid. Yes it is somehow even worse than the Danny Cannon/Stallone version, Dredd is a no budget po faced bore complete with cardboard villains and cardboard acting. In fairness in look at least Urban nails Dredd with his perpetually frowning facial expression.A robotic supercop on the trail of a criminal gang intent on flooding the market in a lawless future with a new highly addictive narcotic. Didn't they do this before with Robocop 2? The low budget constraints restrict the action to a tower block. Maintaining suspense inside one building/set takes some doing. Walter Hill pulled it off with Trespass. With Dredd i had more fun watching Ryan Reynolds in Buried and that was awful.",Dredd
229,Marx_Bros_Fan86,Gruesome action,8,27 January 2013,"I meant to see Dredd in theaters but I never got around to it. Now I really regret it. I could tell that this movie was MEANT to be in 3d. Alas, I saw it on DVD. One of these days I have to see it on a 3d TV to really accurately judge it.What I can say though is that I admire the movie's simplicity and lack of pretension. The movie doesn't waste time with character building scenes or origin stories. I'm not saying that movies shouldn't have character development, but this is Judge Dredd, not Shakespeare. Sometimes action movies are a little too self-important for my taste, but not this movie. Dredd knows what it is and it isn't ashamed of it. Dredd takes place in a dystopian future where America was ravaged by nuclear war. The country is now a police state where policemen, called ""Judges,"" are authorized to determine criminals sentences on the spot without a trial, even death sentences. Dredd is the most feared judge of all and he has been paired up with a rookie with psychic abilities named Anderson. Anderson's gift gives her obvious advantages- she can sense guilt without interrogating prisoners and detect when they have malicious intents. Dredd's first mission with Anderson is to investigate a simple crime in a 200 story apartment building in a slum. Little do they know that this apartment building is the headquarters of the crime lord Ma Ma, where she is manufacturing the hottest new drug, SLO MO, a mind altering substance that allows you to perceive time at an extremely slow speed. Dredd and his rookie companion are forced to fight their way out of the slum while learning to work together. The plot reminds me of one of my favorite movies from last year, The Raid. Given that they were made about the same time I think the similarities are a coincidence.Karl Urban pulls off the grimness of Judge Dredd very well and the movie wisely has him keep his helmet on. There's really not much more to say about the acting except that everybody does a competent job. Game of Thrones fans will enjoy Lena Headey as the drug lord Ma Ma and Olivia Thirlby captures the naive student quality required for the role. The star of this movie is the action. To use a cliché, this is a real roller coaster ride. Even though I didn't see this on a 3d TV I can tell that the slow motion must have made the 3d enhance the action scenes instead of being a cheap gimmick. The drug experiences actually gives the film a reason to have slow motion, unlike most action films nowadays. I have never read the Judge Dredd comics, but I think this movie probably captured the essence of its source material. In a compact 95 minute running length, Dredd doesn't waste time getting to the action and doesn't outstay its welcome. For that I admire it very much.",Dredd
230,nodlimax,Simple story but still very well told,9,2 June 2021,"If we look back at the Stalone Judge Dredd movie one of the biggest criticisms there was the convoluted story that didn't really make a lot of sense. We had conspiracies in there and weird stuff with cloning and so on while the central aspect of the judges was kinda in the background.""Dredd"" on the other hand has a straight forward introduction of what the judges do and then we basically follow Dredd on one of his cases in which he mentors a female rookie judge.Within this story there aren't a lot of twists and turns but what is presented within the story is working very well. The rookie cop is likable and Dredd is relatable in his decisions.I like the characters as well as the performance of the actors. The scenery is also working for me. The action and the soundtrack are a lot of fun as well. The use of slow motion is sensible and usually connected to the drug ""slowmo"" in the movie. It's also used to enhance certain gore effects. So please consider that this movie is pretty violent and has quite a bit of blood and other stuff flying around.Let me also mention that the ending is pretty solid with a good payoff. Finally the movie isn't to long neither.Dredd is not a perfect movie but one I wished I could've watched in theatres when it first came out.",Dredd
231,jsucie,Great movie that does Justice....,9,11 January 2021,"This is a terrific movie with great action, the right kind of cheesy dialogue, & terrific effects. Slo-Mo looks like it would be fun too. It's a shame American audiences didn't take to this movie; most likely since Dredd isn't particularly well known in North America besides the Stallone movie. Urban did a good job only being able to use the bottom half of his face for facial expressions. He brought Justice to the Dredd character. This would probably make a good series if someone is willing to put in the money to not make it look like it's cheap.",Dredd
232,boondocksaint20,I love this movie! This is NOT the Stallone Dredd at all.,10,30 June 2013,"After my third viewing of Dredd (in 3d) I have found something that I rarely find nowadays...a movie that I can't get enough of. It is action packed, dark, brutal and oddly poetic in its violence. The perfect guy movie. Karl Urban, as many have said on these boards, IS Dredd...and that is a remarkable feat to pull off, considering half of his face is shielded for the whole movie (just like in the comics). He plays Dredd with a stoic, uncompromising demeanor...someone who lives and breathes justice and the law, who can kick anyone's ass at a moment's notice, but who also has a very slight 'human' side to him that comes out in brief moments of morality. To be honest, I did not see this in the theaters after not really caring for the Stallone version back in the day. The trailer did look very promising, so it was one I waited for the 3d Bluray release. I am so glad I took the chance because this movie is so satisfying in everything you could want in an action movie.The 3d looks fantastic on Bluray. The studio used new 3d cameras that really show up on the screen. Thankfully, there really aren't many 'throw random things at the viewers face' type of gimmicks, but more so, concentrates on closeups of the actors showing their faces in great detail. This is critical for a character like Dredd, who teeth gnawing grimace must be showcased in order to show any type of emotion from the character.I can't say enough good things about this movie and it is becoming the movie I showcase on my home 3d theater. Hopefully, the home video sales more than made up the rather lackluster box-office results to warrant a sequel. Check it out if you want to go through a wild ride through the eyes of a regular day in the life of Dredd.",Dredd
233,I_should_be_reading_a_book,Should only be watched by fans of the comic.,3,9 November 2017,"Save for Charlie Brown and Mafalda, I've never read a comic book or strip since my teens, thus Judge Dredd was an unknown character to me until I had the misfortune of not finding anything worthwhile and to be a sucker for ScyFi. *** possible spoilers ahead ***In the opening scenes, it sorta shocked me the use of 60s/70s technology like the use of VW vans and the totally outdated arms until I understood this was an ""effort"" to replicate the environment of the rag. Being house-locked with a bad flu, I stuck. Then came the anonymity of the Dredd character, the cardboard acting and almost total absence of cinematography, although I cannot say if it was on purpose, again to emulate the comic. For this alone I give the film a 3 rating, instead of the 1 it probably deserves.The plot (was there one? I have to question) is oh-so-poor as to be completely predictable but, then again, it's probably out of necessity to level it with the intended public.The ""film"" (can we really label it that?) should have started with a warning: ""If you are over 15 and/or not an addicted reader of the AD2000 comic publication, you will: a) Not like it. b) Lose your time on it.

235,JamesIan2021,Wow,8,3 May 2015,"Dredd 3D is one of the most violent and entertaining movies of the year! I went into the cinema expecting violence but nowhere near as bloody at this. Packing a tonne of action, an insanely evil baddie and two awesome protagonists, this is a guaranteed good time. America is an irradiated wasteland. 800,000,00 live in the ruin of the old world in MegaCity One. Crime is at an all time high and a new drug called ""Slow-Mo"" is on the streets which allows addicts to experience time at a much slower rate than normal. When Judge Dredd is called out to investigate a homicide in Peachtrees, along with the help of Judge Anderson they end up locked down in the 200 storey tower, filled to the brim with the MaMa clan, a notorious gang leader who is distributing the drug. Now Dredd and Anderson must fight their way to the top and put an end to MaMa's clan and stop the Slow-Mo. The plot unfolds in a spectacular manner, it never slows down it just speeds up, and the bold action sequences get faster and more exciting as the two Judges venture deeper into the tower. The action is brilliant beyond words, there's no messy editing so the camera stays with the action at all times, you are thrown into the deep end and the relentless nature never stops. It has be said that the 3D makes this film even more jaw dropping, the 3D is one of the stand out aspects, it is beautiful. The effects are mesmerising, transcendental, it genuinely feels like you are falling and experiencing part of the slow-mo drug effects. You can literally touch the glimmers of light and particles floating off the screen, and when the title ""Dredd"" appears it crashes into a million pieces and hits hard. Karl Urban is electrifying as Dredd, a Judge who is in a 200 floor tower in lock-down, filled with thugs controlled by Lena Headey who plays Ma-Ma, a vicious and brutal criminal whose trademark is violence, Lena Headey is hands down the best bad guy of the year, forget Bane and Loki, her violence is shocking and the best scene features her echoed voice projecting across the speaker system addressing Peachtrees, the atmosphere kicks in and you know she is not to be messed with. Alongside Dredd is Olivia Thirlby who is excellent as Anderson, who follows Dredd on his mission. The way she develops throughout the movie is great, she starts as a rookie with the lack of confidence to execute, but as events worsen she turns into a full blown bad-ass. DREDD 3D is a knockout 90 minutes of perfectly constructed non stop action, near perfect 3D and a fantastic cast, Dredd is a high recommendation and it gets better every time you watch it, so yes I'd watch it over and over again.",Dredd
236,McFrogg,The helmet,1,19 April 2018,"Once upon a time, there was a big, dumb movie called ""Judge Dredd"". The special effects were good for its time, but fans and hated it, mainly because Judge Dredd took off his magical helmet (that, and Rob Schneider. And the stupid plot. Critics hated it because it wasn't directed by Martin Scorcese). After all, they expected more than a silly Sylvester Stallone movie.
Some years passed, when suddenly, a smaller but even dumber movie called ""Dredd"" popped up and surprised everyone. Fans of Judge Dredd wondered and worried if little Dredd was going to remove his magical helmet. ""No"" said the Dredd. ""I'll keep it on my stupid little head!"" The fans started to dance and sing, and hold hands. They lifted up Lil' Dredd and heaved him up and down, up and down. Suddenly, they heard a blood-curdling scream! The helmet hit the ground with a bang. Silence. One of the men carefully picked up the helmet...it was empty...only the helmet. Only the helmet. Quiet. The fan started to chuckle. Then laugh. Then he roared like crazy. Everyone resumed the silly little dance, and passed the helmet from one fan to the next in a strange, ritualistic way...forever.*closes book*And that's the only reason why Dredd fans like this movie. Forget that this is just a standard, unoriginal, sadistic action movie that happens to have Judge Dredd in it, a movie you have seen a hundred times already. Forget about the pointless sexual content. You see, it's all about the helmet. Oh no...no! The helmet! THE HELL...MmeeeEEERrrrrrgh!!!!",Dredd
237,ChristianUnchained,"Cool and Creative, yet a blatant ripoff",6,23 April 2013,"3.5 - Dredd is a mixed bag of a film. The stalwart performance of Karl Urban is incredibly likable, as he proves himself both humorous and violent. The action is bombastic and not for the squeamish; it makes the deaths of drug pushers an art form. The post-apocalyptic backdrop has been done before, but the world that the film creates, Mega City One, is both minimalist but wildly creative. The gigantic buildings are huge and feel truly unique, and act as the backdrop to this violent crime thriller. The plot is relatively simple, and is strikingly similar to the low budget-yet incredible action power house The Raid: Redemption. It works, but only to an extent. I would have liked to have seen Dredd in multiple locales, but this being a origins story I can see why they took the direction that they did for this first entry. The action here is also really well done. It only permeates the film, rather than engulfing it. What is here, though, is very stylish and different from most action films. Bright neon shootouts, heavily filtered quick kills; it's been done before but Dredd does it a little differently, making it mildly noteworthy. The biggest thing that I came away from was the incredible interesting backdrop that Dredd runs through. The Mega City One truly is a very visually ""cool"" backdrop that I do hope the impending sequels explore. The art direction is, to say the least, very good. It was predictable and the action wasn't memorable (save for the stylish deaths), but it is a thrilling film that does enough right to be solid in it's execution. Whatever the sentence may be, Dredd is a stoic and memorable anti-hero with plenty to say by his actions. The style of DREDD is high, and the direction is really great, it just doesn't go far enough to truly be the game changer many hoped it to be. But I will say this: Dredd is indeed fun, and a little more clever than most meat-head action films. The world of Dredd has been opened wide, and consider me along for the ride for any new addition to this interesting universe. Side Note: Please see this movie in 3D. I didn't. I should've.",Dredd

First off let me jut point out that i have 0, absolutely 0 complaints whatsoever about this movie at all, none and thats pretty rare for me but its dredd, how the hell can you hate it. It has nonstop action violence and its so heart pounding starting from the intro and the score and theme and the whole entire ost in beyond anything that i have ever seen before. This is another one of those movies that i should have known about and i feel like i should have seen this a long, long time ago. The motorcycle chase in the intro after the whole score and suit up scene is just beyond bad ass and this is the better version of robocop hands down. The acting was good and the effects were cool and i also like the fact that you never actually get to see dredds face in the movie but i mean you can look up the actor and see it. This movie really left a mark on me and made me feel great and i even made my own version of a suit and spray painted my Nerf guns. The first dredd was like a mix between robocop and mad max. I was so excited to see this movie and it did not at all disappoint and there was never a dull moment. The whole movie for the most part took place in a building and it was like a video game going through waves of criminals going higher and higher to the top to get to the boss ma ma. It is so cool and bad ass and i love it and i dont really like movies that take place mostly in one place but this one gets a pass because its bad ass and its dredd for crying out loud.

239,James_Denton,One of the most underrated movies ever made. A must watch for anyone.,10,2 April 2018,"One of the most underrated movies in the last few years, Dredd provides an action filled escape from reality by taking you inside the walls of Mega City One, to the ruthless streets & blocks policed the men & women of the halls of justice... The Judges!Directed by Pete Travis, this is a superb film showing how action films can and should be done. Unfortunately, the film tries to make use of 3D technology with the aim of giving a more immersive experience for the viewer and although 3D technology (in film) is now defunct, this doesn't detract from the action sequences in anyway.Karl Urbans performance as Dredd is spot on and fans of Judge Dredd will not be let down.. a calm, resolute, stern and weary character that accurately portrays what years of bringing justice to the streets of Mega City One would feel like.The storyline is relatively simple too, and closely resembles the Indonesian film The Raid (another excellent film). Detractors of Dredd might feel it stole the plot, but Dredd was conceived first and all similarities are most likely down to pure coincidence. If you haven't seen this film, then add it to the top of your list as it's a must!!Here's hoping they eventually make a much deserved sequel with Karl Urban reprising the role.",Dredd

Bad marketing I guess, which is baffling because this is a masterpiece in my opinion.Hats off to Karl Urban as Dredd. Man, talk about an awesome performance where we literally only see his mouth and jaw. He expresses so much ""bad-assery"" in that friggin helmet it's unreal. What a talent.

242,hkauteur,HK Auteur Review - Dredd,7,2 September 2013,"It is an unfortunate coincidence that Dredd is correlated to The Raid: Redemption because they have similar setups. Fortunately, I saw The Raid: Redemption earlier in the summer of 2012 and missed Dredd in theaters, as a result I have enough time in between the two films to mentally separate them. Being unfamiliar with the source material, what I actually ended up comparing Dredd was the 1996 Slyvester Stallone's Judge Dredd. It's a sci-fi movie that I grew up on and entertained me (however Demolition Man is the superior sci-fi Slvyester Stallone movie). It's famously criticized because Sylvester Stallone, at the behest of the producers, plays the latter two-thirds of the film with his helmet off. Judge Dredd in the comics, never takes off his helmet. I never knew what the big deal was with the insistence that the Judge Dredd character must keep his helmet on... till I saw Dredd.Judge Dredd is not a character as more a representation of pure black-and-white law taken to the extreme. That's why he's meant to be faceless. Taking off his mask and trying to find the human backstory behind that character completely shatters what he thematically represents. Yes, I know I sound stupid right now. However, a movie with Judge Dredd alone just shooting criminals would have been boring. The filmmakers understand this, so they have placed in a buddy cop dynamic into the film with the Judge Anderson character. She is more human and more dimensional as a character, and set as a juxtaposition to the stoic Dredd. It can even be argued that the movie is Judge Anderson's story. Both characters had a good working chemistry and the film deeply benefits from their buddy dynamic as it provides something human enough for me to hang onto between the action scenes.As Judge Dredd, Karl Urban manages to communicate a lot under a helmet and has a firm grasp of the material. Playing a character who is that extreme can easily fall into parody very quickly (there are many Youtube videos parodying Stallone's delivery ""I'm the law!"") and Urban doesn't fall into that. Lena Headey is cold and scary without being cartoonish as the film's villain Ma-Ma. The film is over-the-top but there's no 'wink wink', everybody just ""is"" the character they're playing.Slow motion in films have been overdone and viewers have grown used to it now. The way to keep slow motion fresh is to incorporate it into the story. Having a drug that slows down your perception of time is arguably the most blatant way to do this. But you know what? It works! It seems fresh and they take the Slo-Mo drug as a story device and take it to creative places. The films has fun action set pieces. The next set piece tops the last and it moves fast enough for you to ever really ponder about the satirical tones.Dredd is fun and made by a team that understands and loves the material. Their goals with this movie were simple but they accomplish them. It makes me think, as proved by the 1995 film, that perhaps the Judge Dredd property is not meant to be adapted into a vehicle for a big name star. The dark humor combined with ultra-violent tone of it just registers as something kitschier that will fare better for a smaller audience. No one's going to take their whole family to see this movie but more likely a group of guys will cackle over it with a case of beers in their apartment.For the people that want to see Dredd will get it and enjoy it. For the people who don't care that much may just dismiss it as being a lesser version of The Raid: Redemption. I'm not going to get on that bandwagon, Dredd deserves better.",Dredd
243,jaguiar313,Tedious and brutally violent exercise in overkill.,5,21 September 2012,"Dredd is the second attempt at bringing the comic book character of Judge Dredd to the big screen, the first being the failed Sylvester Stallone vehicle from 1995. This time Dredd is played with appropriate growling by Karl Urban and there is thankfully no Rob Schneider in sight. But, unfortunately Dredd 3D in an effort to distance itself from the previous film, goes completely overboard in the opposite direction and becomes so dark and brutally violent that the film is downright depressing. And there is so much violence that a half hour in you are completely numb to it all and just don't care and the rest of the film is just a tedious repeat of the same violence over and over. The story has Dredd and rookie sidekick, Anderson (the cute Olivia Thirlby) investigating a triple homicide in a massive tenement run by Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) a scarred ex-hooker turned drug kingpin. When they capture one of Ma's top soldiers, she locks down the building and Dredd and his rookie charge are left to fight for their lives against a building full of adversaries. While this sounds like a fun ride, director Pete Travis takes the material far too seriously and while he has a nice visual eye, he spatters us with so much blood and brutality from so early on that we become numb within the first act. He brings little or no suspense or energy to a film that should have plenty and paints such a hopeless and dark world around the extreme violence that we get totally weighed down by the nihilism of it all and stop caring. The characters have little or no development and so it's very hard to care about the good guys and all the bad guys look the same so they don't matter much either. Only Headley brings a bit of menace to Ma-Ma but, there is only so much she can do with a thinly written role. As for our hero, he's such a dark and brooding character that we really don't get behind him either. He is just as brutal and cruel in his dispatching of his enemies that he is no different then they except that he has a badge. Then why should we root for him? Thirlby does bring a touch of humanity (the only character who really has any) to the psychic Anderson and that makes her likable but, even she gets lost in all the carnage. And if the blood soaked carnage isn't enough to beat us senseless, the film's pounding techno score will finish the job. Dredd is a brutal and tedious exercise in overkill without the style and substance to turn into entertainment as a master like John Woo has done time and time again. At least the film has some nice production value for a modestly budgeted movie. At least there's that.",Dredd
244,ikrani,This is Not a Movie,3,5 March 2014,"Now, I cannot critique it without inevitably comparing it to its predecessor, ""Judge Dredd"", so here we go.The first problem of ""Dredd"" is Dredd himself, played by Karl Urban. Urban portrays totalitarian law personified as a human being, mindless and 100% dedicated to what he serves. While this is a neat concept on paper, it leads to a very predictable and ultimately boring character, defined only by his occupation and nothing more. While that bit with the children was a good way to throw us off, it lost its appeal in the face of all the predictable outcomes with Dredd's other encounters in the megastructure. By contrast, Stallone played a sort of zealot who was also 100% dedicated to the law he served but still had human qualities about him. Not only that, but it was rather intriguing to see Stallone's character struggle with the idea that the law which he had dedicated his life to serving was flawed and imperfect, something that is never touched upon in this film.The second problem with ""Dredd"" is the villain. While Lena Headey is a talented actress, her character suffers from the same problem as Karl Urban's: she is completely defined by her occupation as a drug lord. While she was a bit more interesting than Dredd due to her psychosis making her less predictable, she was still a bore by the end of it. Armand Assante in Judge Dredd may have been an overacting pile of ham and cheese, but his character was far more complex in his issues with the law and what he viewed as guilt and innocence, as well as being far more entertaining to watch. Plus, in Dredd, nothing would've changed if the villain won. A new drug would've hit the streets of Mega City One and the city would've been just as much a stinking cesspool of corruption and violence as it was before.This is two things, neither of which make it a movie. Firstly, Dredd is fan service, and not the good kind of fan service that's sprinkled throughout the movie for fans to enjoy along with the casual viewers. This movie is a film made solely for the fans and seems to alienate people like me who just want a good movie, be it hammy or serious.The second thing I call this pseudo-movie is the first segment of an actual movie. It has all of two changes to the status quo: Dredd and the cadet are locked in the megastructure, and then the judges sent to help them turn out to be evil. This is what the first part of a movie is supposed to be: establishing the status quo for what constitutes the norm, and then upsetting it at the end to pave way into the events leading up to the climax. Come to think of it, this entire movie is essentially the first 20 minutes of ""Judge Dredd"": there's a problem downtown, Dredd and another Judge (or two) go to take care of it, cue action scene, and at the end we get corrupt Judges.There are a few things that keep this movie from being a 1 out of 10. The futuristic world is interesting and Dredd's gun is always cool to see in its incredibly implausible workings. Cadet Anderson is a decent character with an actual personality, and the tension between her and the lieutenant from the drug gang is interesting. The concept of the evil judges was also a welcome change but came far too late to be of any interest to me.This movie felt so cramped, like it wanted to tell a big, grand story about this brave new world it has but decides to keep us trapped in one setting with Dredd and Anderson. It left me with a bad feeling in my gut like the one I had watching ""The Dark Knight Rises"" or one of M. Night Shyamalan's movies.No, I don't care about the visuals or how cool the slow-mo sequences are. You people complain about James Cameron's Avatar being style over substance and yet this bore fest gets a free pass. Why? Because it's not made for general audiences, it's made exclusively for hardcore fans of the comic. This movie fails because it needs you to be invested in these characters and concepts BEFORE you sit down to watch it, something no movie should require.Come to think of it, they might've been able to afford a wider variety of scenery if they hadn't put so much into the 3D and slo-mo effects. Oh well. Now get to work on that sequel, Hollywood, and this time make it BIG.",Dredd
245,pootc,"A completely, unexpected, gem deserving of cult status!",10,31 August 2015,"Dredd (2012) is not to be confused with much maligned Sylvester Stallone film (from 1995) is an unrelenting, faithful and exciting science fiction actioner complete with a great cast of formidable villains and interesting characters.Karl Urban assumes the titular role of title role of (Judge) Dredd. A growling, humorless, pretty-much anti-character whose only three directives are judge, jury and executioner. By saying he is an anti- character isn't necessarily a bad thing. It's a completely faithful adaptation from the 2000AD comic books. He doesn't grow through the story, or have a personal life or any emotional arc to speak of. Just a black and white sense of duty and devotion to everything serving the almighty law. It's what he was built for, and the only thing holding civilization together.Olivia Thirby plays Judge Cassandra Andersen who is the opposite of Dredd and his new rookie sidekick on her first day of the job and her official evaluation. Its sink or swim for her and she's in way over her head it seems but has a few tricks up her sleeve too. She plays the yin to Dredd's yang, a more human and feeling character which is exactly what's needed to balance out our by the book hero.Lena Headey plays the Ma-Ma. A former prostitute turned brutal drug- lord and the main villain.The future sees earth as a dystopian wasteland called 'Cursed Earth'. On the east coast lies Mega-City One, a violent metropolis and one of the last remaining cities left. To combat the growing rate of violence and despair the only force for order are the Judges, who act as judge, jury and executioner. The story revolves around the Peach Trees, just one of the 200- storey slum towers which make up Mega-City One. Three drug dealers are executed, instilled with a new drug called 'Slo-Mo'. Both Dredd and Andersen are sent into investigate and all hell breaks loose. There are so many stories that can be told in the Judge Dredd universe just like Peach Trees being just one slum-tower of many which makes up Mega-City One - it was a great starting point. The story is very well-executed on a budget of only 45 million. The action is top-notch and the filmmakers didn't shy away from the gore and instead focused on a heavy old-school action movie instead of a kid-friendly affair for a change - a brave choice. Unfortunately this could have been where the filmmakers went wrong by not appealing to that larger market because the advertising for this movie was non-existent, hurting the chances for a sequel which is a massive shame. The movie has so much potential as an appealing franchise. I loved the world created here as said this is just one of the stories inside the metropolis of Mega-City One and I know I am not alone in wanting more. I personally loved this movie and you've got to admire the effort from the designs, characters and action. A completely, unexpected, gem deserving of cult status. Hoping for more!9/10",Dredd
246,pintaxandre,"Dreddfully entertaining, but...",7,9 November 2019,"Mixed bag in here. Some positive and negative.
I loved the visuals and how the film's universe is presented. A very good use of slow-motion.
Good actors to support the main roles, but very little writing and develpment of the characters. The main character, dredd, sometimes doesn't feel like the focus of the story. I sometimes had the feeling it was the rooky's movie.
Good script ideas, but so many plot holes and questions left unanswered. This film would probably have gained to be longer and take more time to develop its universe, its rules, what justice represents and stand for and of course the characters could have had a little more depth.
I feel like this film was very competent in some areas, but very very lazy on other ones. I understand the budget was limited, but when I watch this film, I just see so much untaped potential that could just have been exploited. A pity, but maybe another time...",Dredd
247,hthbrr2,Right to a fair trial? Not needed in this black and white world!!!,1,3 December 2013,"SPOILERS!Wow I can barely express in words how HORRIBLE this movie was. Wow just wow. Conservative propaganda at it's best. Which means caring about human life that is not filthy rich is not necessary.To explain this movie I have to first explain conservative values. Conservatives believe that men know better than everyone else. Specifically the white male. White Anglo Saxon Protestant you get the deal the waspish guys. Women are considered lower than men, stupid and only there to be sexualized/used as a tool by men. As Dredd's side kick and the main female bad guy are constantly used this way. Both are depicted as pleasuring men...disgusting. Also the only reason that this female Anderson is allowed to be Dredd's partner is cuz she is a mutant! Wow, as if 'to make up for' her being a woman.Also funny is that conservatives hate government involvement in THEIR lives. But don't mind at all calling the cops to beat the crap out of the poor. So notice in this movie how ALL the bad guys are MINORITIES!!!! Ma-ma female, her cronies are black men or other minorities. And the tech guy that had his eyes ripped out was allowed to leave cuz he was an innocent victim. Aww, notice how he was a WHITE MALE!!!!NEVER do conservatives portray a white male in a bad light. I mean in ANY movie where YOU are the boss you will portray yourself in a good way. You're not going to make yourself a bad guy! BUT conservatives ALSO show EVERYONE else in a BAD light.In this movie everyone is CLEARLY guilty. It's OK no fair trial needed...what? Umm, wasn't Ma-ma a victim of the system? Driven crazy by a male dominated world that doing this was the ONLY way to break out of a male dominated world. ""Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable."" - John F. Kennedy. Great quote. In the movie they talk about how Ma-ma took over the building and ""in 9 months"" she took over. NINE MONTHS...hmm like how long a pregnancy takes. Wow they are so SUBTLE with their sexism. *rolls eyes* As if to say ""She is a woman she should have made a baby INSTEAD, that is a woman's purpose."" You see this is the conclusion they WANT you to reach. Disgusting. Also a preggo woman was held hostage in the movie and was shown as an innocent victim, since she was 'doing her job as woman.' (Translation carrying children). She was still held at gunpoint and terrorized though, NO woman is off the hook according to conservatives. See how all women who want to not be pregnant and barefoot in the kitchen are shown in a bad light. Also I'm pretty sure the preggo girl as working in a kitchen! Wow so much sexism....we get it you're ignorant! You think women should 'stay in the kitchen'. And all the bootlickers who say ""Oh she was working in a kitchen and just happened to be preggo."" Just shut up we see the messages.Notice how there are NO positive females in this movie. Dredd's boss a black female seems borderline incompetent. Ugh, again the whole idea that whites are superior, as well as females being less than men, disgusting! She seems to be totally oblivious to what's going on. Again another propaganda piece to make people say ""Women they are so cold..."" bla bla bla. So SICK of this crap! Riiight the givers of life, the nurtures are the cruel ones, not the males that start fights.....*rolls eyes*Why not take the bad guys to jail? Oh that's right cuz in this universe EVERYTHING is black and white. NO shades of grey, NO understanding. All bad guys are drug addicts, rapists, violent. Umm what about white collar crime? Oh wait, cops are only meant to interfere in the poor ppls lives! Disgusting. There was one scene where they told a homeless guy to move and stop begging. He did not, and what happened? He was killed by the doors. If only he had moved, wow so sick. He deserved DEATH for sitting somewhere!? WHAT!? REALLY!? Well, damn! As if they are saying ""Take that as a lesson poor people get in line. But us white people we can kill with immunity."" How very sick.All the gratuitous violence leads me to believe that this movie was made for dumb teenagers. The prez of the USA is half-black, and lots of ppl in the USA are STILL racist. Movies like these show a desperate plea for white people to rule with an iron fist again. They just can't get with the program. We are all EQUAL. We are all HUMAN BEINGS. And there are SHADES OF GREY!Should the bad guys done those things, no. But when you are in a system that cares nothing about you what do you expect!? It reminds me of the Zimmerman case where he basically played Judge Jury and Executioner with Travon Martin! He JUDGED that he was 'suspicious' (translation he was a young black male). He RULED that he should be followed (got out of the car AGAINST orders from the cops). And executed him. Well what was Travon supposed to do? Not defend himself!?This movie is SO disgusting and if you see the people who like it they tend to be conservatives.",Dredd
248,reidandgenene,Dreddful,2,16 February 2019,"This movie is a rip off of the excellent Thai movie, 'The Raid', already remade by Hollywood as 'Brick Mansions'. Urban plays Dredd so much like a Robocop that one wonders if that was the original intent but the rights were too expensive.As so often with bad sci fi flicks, the world makes no sense. Everyone in America is in one giant city, with the rest of the continent a desert wasteland. Even with Soylent Green, what do all the teeming millions eat?Don't bother with this movie.",Dredd

250,rorygunn,Kind of standard if you think about it.,6,29 March 2021,You have the rich world of Judge Dredd to draw from and instead of giving us one of the incredible stories that involve Rico or.maybe something involving Hammerstein the filmmakers gave us a standard story that could have been done as part of any action movie and you wouldn't have known the difference. Even Karl Urban is standard. He doesn't really come across from behind the helmet. That's why Peter Weller was so effective as Robocop. He could portay a character who is covered up for most of the film and still bring the character across. Karl Urban for some reason didn't connect as Dredd for me. He wasn't feared like Dredd is supposed to be. Also it ddn't help that they saddled him with a female partner who was also a rookie. Say what you will about the 1995 Dredd but at least Dredd's reputation was well known and they gave him a good adversary in Rico. MeeMaw the drug queen just didn't seem to come across as someone Dredd should be worried about. All in all you could have done this story in a standard action story with different characters and it would have made no difference.,Dredd
251,maxastree,Dredd-ful,3,15 October 2015,"When the pre-release hype for this film appeared, I was pretty enthusiastic initially; the characterization and sets looked dead-on and advance reviews were quite strong, also Karl Urban is a Wellington city local, where I live so I felt supportive at that point, also the original Fleetway comic's were a wellspring of black comedy, anarchy and, well, violence.Actually, the original Dredd stories used violence as a means to an end; part of a cop/crime narrative in a comically dystopian, mega-consumerist future world filled with robots, crime, mutants and overpopulation.Frankly, I disagree with the frequently positive reviews of the movie, and as it turns out, Dredd got practically zero traction in the US film market. Made in South Africa on a modest budget with a lot of the production staff from the movie District Nine, the main problem with Dredd is its garish, tasteless violence, and secondly its lack of plot - save for an initial setup featuring Dredd (law enforcer) trying to get to the top of a tower block where Mama (criminal scum) is dwelling with her henchmen, who are basically a trigger-happy drug cartel that torture and disembowel lesser mortals and threaten everybody in the area via the buildings intercom system.Unfortunately the above paragraph actually explains the entire movie which otherwise consists of, in no particular order: shouting, killing, stair climbing, killing, shouting, stair climbing, close-ups of criminal scum getting shot in the head, or shoulder, or arm, or chest, stair climbing, shouting, poison gas, machine guns, shouting, more stairs, more shooting.The protagonist, Dredd, has zero character, he's intense, but there's no substantial dialogue, no back story, no genuine interaction - the films limited budget is an issue also, as a key shootout scene across two balconies features obvious use of miniatures. Also the slow motion use of graphic bullet wounds is more repulsive and unpleasant than satirical.The film isn't supposed to be a comedy, but it wouldn't be a proper Judge Dredd picture without the punk era sense of future shock and off-kilter humour - there's none here, nor a story development.PS - slow motion shots of peoples guts or heads being torn apart by bullets is GROSS, and this movie didn't warrant a sequel due to poor audience reception. It might be a cult item in the future. As I mentioned, they got the main dudes costume dead on, which is a start.Ugh.",Dredd
252,nexus-37,Most likely best comic-movie i've ever seen.,10,30 December 2012,"I had to watch this 9 times before review.. Actually only once from beginning to an end.This couldn't be much better. I loved those comics in old days, tried to create own ones where also was Dredd, Megacity etc.Its really hard to say much more without spoiling, really interesting movie all through, don't mess with comics much, made little more realistic and thats not bad at all, at least comparing to many movies that relies on comics too much then they got messed up totally. Of course you can use CGI nowadays almost for anything but here its somehow balanced.One cant really compare this to the original ""movie"" where Stallone is, its totally different and funny; silly funny but not too bad....oh one thing more, trailer is no good for you it doesn't show anything you could grab on. If you like comics, scifi, Dredd etc. this is one masterpiece to watch (dont get drunk while watching this one needs some thinking too err) 10/10",Dredd
253,tgooderson,Above Average Action Movie,8,14 September 2012,"I've never read a Dredd comic and was fortunate enough never to see the 1995 Danny Cannon/Sylvester Stallone adaptation so went in completely cold to the story and characters. I understood that there was some sort of big deal about not taking Dredd's helmet off but that was about it. I also understand that it's one of the UK's biggest and best known comics so it's with great pleasure to report that in a summer of incredible comic book adaptations that Dredd is able to mix it up with the American behemoths and come out the other side as a really solid action movie which mixes the best of the 1980s with a modern twist.Mega-City One never feels like it's in America and was actually shot in South Africa. It has a kind of sweaty, tropical feel to it which distances it from the idea that we are on the Atlantic coast of America. This isn't a major problem though as it adds to the dystopian nature of the planet and the film. The city feels rough, run down and lived in and the tower block Peach Trees which is the setting for most of the action feels realistic enough to be believable but far enough away from reality to remain part of science fiction. There are many elements from today's blocks and slums which are mixed with fantasy elements to create a realistic and seedy environment of gangsters, dealers and regular Joes that is very reminiscent of real life inner city areas. The visual design of the tower block is excellent and gives it a grimy feel. The special effects work well on the whole but occasionally the blood spatter looked poor. The violence is quite gruesome at times and the film doesn't shy away from showing it. The impact of some of the more violent scenes is shocking, which in an age of desensitisation shows just how violent it is. In a way though I'm glad it was there. It was needed to show both the lengths that the bad guys will go to stop the Judges and the lengths that the Judges will go to bring them to justice. It also showed how much further the desensitisation to violence has progressed in Mega-City One.The plot is fairly well trodden and predictable but the elements around it make it very enjoyable. This isn't the first time that we've seen an experienced 'cop' take a rookie out on their first job only to get into big trouble and due to an unfortunate coincidence this isn't the first time this year that we've had a plot about law enforcement making their way up through a tower block to face the boss at the top. The plot of The Raid is painfully similar which is a shame because from what I understand, it is purely incidental. Luckily though there are enough genre and action differences that they feel like two completely different movies.I saw the film in 3D (a rare occurrence for me) on the recommendation of a friend and I'm pleased to report that I will continue to call her a friend because the 3D didn't ruin the film. For me that's a bold statement. It felt like the film was designed with 3D in mind instead of it being a gimmick that was introduced in post-production and I have to admit that it added to my enjoyment of several scenes, most notably those which were seen through the eyes of the drug Slo-Mo. There are still problems of light loss and motion blur but these are not as noticeable as in many films I've seen in the medium before. This is one of the few times which for I would recommend seeing the in 3D.The acting is quite good. Karl Urban is excellent as Dredd and I couldn't stop speaking in his gruff voice all the way home, much to the annoyance of my girlfriend. He seems a little emotionless and robotic which I think was intentional and made the character who he was. He was also great in the action scenes, dispensing justice in a cool, unflappable manner. Olivia Thirlby gave the wide eyed newbie performance but was able to alter it as the film progressed. She had a much more emotional approach which worked well with Urban's emotionless role. Game of Thrones resident incestuous Queen Lena Headley was brilliant as the 'big boss' playing the counter to Urban's Dredd. Both were calm killers but Headley allowed some emotion to creep onto her composed exterior towards the end. It's great also that two of the three leads in a major action movie were women and not just that but women who weren't merely wife's, girlfriends or eye candy. Their roles had purpose and were well written and performed. I was also pleased to see The Wire's Wood Harris make an appearance, although his role was limited and Domhnall Gleeson, an actor who is showing great promise, is very good in his small role.Overall Dredd is an above average science fiction/comic book/action movie. It is well made, features great design and cinematography, and has a good cast but a plot which is unremarkable. The soundtrack, featuring a thumping electronic beat works brilliantly with the on screen action I'd be interested in going back to Mega-City One at least once more.www.attheback.blogspot.com",Dredd
254,verminhater,Nothing like the Stallone version and much better for it,8,26 March 2014,"Forget the Stallone version. This is nothing like it at all. There's no cheesy costumes or super villains, just non-stop action.The thing that struck me most was that this Dredd never shows his face at all. On top of that he shows no emotion either. What actor would want such a part? Well Karl Urban did a fantastic job of it. Full marks. His side-kick played by Olivia Thirlby is the perfect rookie. There's no cliché rookie/instructor interplay here, just believable interaction making perfect sense.The villain of the piece is all too believable in the form of Lena Headey (Hollywood loves British villains). No taking over the city plot here, just a large scale villain making their way in the world.The script is great, the direction top notch. The film moves along at a great pace with action all the way. It's all too easy to think the future of real cities lies on this path. I'm not a fan of the comic books and you certainly don't need to be to enjoy this film. If you want a great action movie this is one to add to your watch list. The only way I could see anyone disliking it is if they were a major fan of the comic and enraged at any liberties taken by the film makers in not adhering to some part of the comic. Comics don't always translate well to the screen. Often changes are needed and here is a great example of how to do it. They should make a sequel.",Dredd
255,darksyde-63508,Not sure how to feel about this remake,3,13 January 2018,"The first Judge Dress movie, with Sylvester Stallone, was kind of a joke, a b grade action movie, if you will. This remake, or reboot, or whatever you wanna call it, ups the stakes a little. To keep with the times, it is definitely a LOT more violent and gorier than the Stallone version, with people exploding, getting skinned and thrown out windows, and people getting shot rather graphically. The plot, even though there really isn't much of one, is pretty standard. Dredd and a rookie judge go after the head of a gang who is selling a new drug, and through hacking, the gang traps Dredd and the rookie inside the city . Lots of gunfire and blood ensues.

The tone was gritty and realistic like the comics, the costumes and set designs were larger than life and the characters on both sides of the law were menacing. Urban was way better than Stallone in the lead role and Lena Heady is always decent in whatever she's in. Olivia Thirlby was particularly cool and held her own (Total Badass). The atmosphere of the movie and the world that is portrayed was stylish and terrifying as if Japanese ad culture was integrated with North American society.

I began to get disappointed when I saw the first images from the set, as the costume and bike were all wrong. When I saw the general environment of Meg1 I was even more disappointed, as this was not the world of Judge Dredd. If you want to see the real JD world, see the first (terrible otherwise) movie with the (completely wrong choice for JD) Stallone. I sat down to watch the movie not expecting much, however I was pleasantly surprised to find out that even though the visual aesthetics of the comic were missing, the spirit of the comic was there. It is obvious that the budget was extremely limited for this particular movie, and normally they should stick the idea to the drawer, waiting for a better budget. Regardless, the director did an excellent job, the writers used the budget to their advantage, and the new JD and J Anderson could not be any better.Now, regarding the fact that people were disappointed not to see JD's face. This movie is targeted towards a specific audience - unfortunately. Those who know what JD is about, would consider outrageous revealing his face again. JD is the personification of the law. He is supposed to be an idea. Not a man with a face. JD is not like the marvel movies that are targeted to a wide audience. In this movie, what was the big mistake of the studio, was that it did not make it 100% accurate to the comic in order to hold the faithful audiences, but instead tried to compromise regarding the aesthetics and make it more accessible to new audiences. I did not pay to watch this in the big screen - and I am a huge JD fan ! So, if they could not get me to pay for a movie ticket, this was a huge failure marketing wise. However, I liked it - a lot-, but I would not hold my breath for a sequel - this century...",Dredd

264,jefflouvre-435-77367,Just plain Dredd-ful,3,19 September 2012,"DREDD is 90 minutes of non-stop, violent and inane action that will make Resident Evil: Retribution look like Alice in Wonderland. Two bang-bang movies opening one week after the other will not appease filmgoers.I can't remember anything about the first Dredd starring Slyvester Stallone, but I also don't think I'll remember anything about Karl Urban playing the titular character in director Pete Travis' third movie, which is written by Alex Garland. Garland wrote the book The Beach, made into a movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio.This Dredd is an all-out assault on the senses; it's all style with no substance. Viewers will notice the drained-out colours, the pumped-up disco beats and slow-motion action scenes that are reminiscent of 300, for example, bullets piercing faces and bodies. These are shocking but, at the same time, have a balletic beauty.Once again, the future of Mega City One isn't worth looking forward to as it's overpopulated and rife with crime. The only consolation is the Justice Ministry's judges (cops) who patrol the streets and are the judge, jury and executioner.The baddies are up to no good concocting a new drug and it's up to a tough, robotic-like creature to break up the business and inflict serious damage on them. This is reminiscent of RoboCop (1987), who also had to break up a drug lab run by violent criminals.The opening scene shows judge Dredd's efficiency is dispensing justice and disposing of criminals with unerring accuracy.He is then asked to supervise a newcomer to the force, Anderson (pretty blonde Olivia Thirlby, who appeared in Juno). She barely passed her entrance tests but she's been given special dispensation for one day because she has psychic abilities and looks good in a tight black suit.Since Dredd's face is covered up with only his chin in full sight, it's up to Anderson to show lots of face. She doesn't have to wear a helmet because, as she says, she forgot to bring one along. In this respect, I thought it was wise of the director to have one of the two judges to have a face for the audience to focus on.Viewers should also know that the pairing of a senior cop and a rookie cop is a staple of cop movies.The first order of the day for the duo is to check out a multiple homicide at a block of 200-storey flats. They find out the block has been left to its own devices as no judge dares to venture into this area.They capture a villain, who's an aide of drug baroness Ma-Ma (Lena Heady of Game of Thrones). Ma-Ma must be violent because she sports a nasty scar on her cheek.Now the action picks up and continues relentlessly until the end. Dredd and Anderson find themselves stuck in the flats and must fend for themselves until help arrives. All her breaks loose, with bullets and incendiary devices flying all over the place.Urban is gruff and monotonous in his delivery of lines. Anderson does stand up to him and for herself, as she grows into her job. Her deciding to free Ma-Ma's computer technician shows her ability to make her own judgments.www.jeffleemovies.com (FB and Twitter)",Dredd

268,lethalweapon,"Aptly violent, dark and gritty reboot",7,6 January 2013,"The new and improved take on the British comic book character, Judge Dredd, is part of an elite squad of law enforcers in the post apocalyptic world of Mega-city One. He is a motorcycle riding Judge, authorized to act as judge, jury and executioner, dispensing retail justice on the move. Judge Dredd is one of the top agents, set to evaluate new recruit Cassandra Anderson, a psychic on her first day on probation.They pair up to investigate a gang execution of three dealers, brutally skinned alive and tossed off a high rise building. The building is in control of drug lord Ma-Ma, who is bringing the hot new drug 'slo-mo', which slows down the user's perception to 1% of normal; so the users will experience life in slow motion, while the drug is in effect. When Dredd and Anderson pick up a key suspect, who is likely to testify and bring down Ma-ma's operation, she shuts down the building and starts an all-out war against the two Judges before they can communicate with headquarters.The action is superb, the effects are brilliant - especially how the slo-mo drug effects are shown - and the tone is befittingly dark. Karl Urban is perfect for the title role - serious, to the point, fastidious, methodical; a far cry above Stallone's 1995 interpretation. The movie is graphically violent, though, so I think it may appeal to all.I loved the movie; it was one of the best action movie experiences I've seen in recent times, but I have to nitpick. Firstly, the drug, slo- mo... Slowing down time to 1% normal is just waaay too intense. 1 percent normal would mean that one minute of time would be perceived as one and a half hour. That is far slower than the effects shown. I know that's a weirdly specific point to nitpick on, but that just bugged me. And I have an even more specific nit to pick on - the policing rate. Dredd tells Anderson that the Judges are so understaffed that they can only effectively monitor less than ???% of violent crimes in the city. With such an alarming rate, I would expect any organization to have lower entry thresholds for new recruits. But apparently, they still restrict recruits to extremely stringent standards. I know... Silly nitpicks, but somehow, these things bothered me.Another issue - not a nitpick this time - was the 'talking villain syndrome', the contrived plot device that has the villain talking with the hero before killing him, giving him ample time to escape. While we have accepted this as standard fare for action movies, Dredd takes this bit to comic levels. The extend to which it was used here (in one instance) would have fit a Scary Movie franchise more than a serious film.Despite these issues, the movie gets all my thumbs up. Hope they get to make a sequel and keep the franchise running.",Dredd
269,twbond-00867,"Judge, jury, and a well executed movie!",9,31 January 2021,"Dredd (2012) is a redefined version of the Judge Dredd character, previously played by Sylvester Stallone (Judge Dredd (1995)) in this violent, twisted take with a point A to point B storyline. It's straight to the point on how deathly looking a cruel world can be. And with the 18+ Rating, it's the perfect way to tell the character.Karl Urban plays judge, jury and executioner brilliantly, and gives you everything you would want in a Dredd movie. This is the best Judge Dredd movie to date, and every aspect to the location, to the violence, to the straight-forward story shows you, you wouldn't be disappointed. The attention to detail in Judge Dredd gear is fantastic, due to it's unrealistic, futuristic portrayal makes it more believable due to it's hardcore rating and how characters react to certain situations. The drugs, especially, make it more threateningly exciting, the slowing down special effects make The Matrix (1999) look more like PG-13, something that wasn't intended to use in the 1995 movie.The villain is terrifying, and violent it matches it's genre. It's a fantastic way to make it something worth telling to the audience. Lena Headey portrays the villain spot-on, you wouldn't want to be on her bad side. The rest of the cast really give a show, but Urban and Headey lead the movie. The rookie, played by Olivia Thirlby, however, joins the two stars as she dives into a situation she has never been prepared yet, like Ethan Hawke's Jake Hoyt with higher tech.The movie is outstanding, and it's a well-deserved version of the character. Dredd (2012) is a must watch!

270,DjfunkmasterG,DREDD (2012) - My thoughts and opinion on the 2012 reboot of the failed 1995 film,8,29 August 2013,"DREDD (2012) - My thoughts and opinion on the reboot of the failed 1995 film starring Sylvester Stallone.The original Judge Dredd film was just horrible, not from just a script stand point, but from an execution, direction, and cast. Plagued with more problems than I can list, it became one of Stallone's biggest flops that saw his career go into massive decline for years.The newest entry, a reboot issued in 2012 by director Pete Travis and Lion's Gate, brings Karl Urban (RED) into the title characters role as a futuristic, cop, judge jury and executioner. This update, which is extremely violent and on par with what I would expect of a future that is riddled with crime, is best described as Robocop meets RAID: Redemption.When a notorious gang leader known as Ma Ma (Lena Headey, 300) takes control of a tenant high rise controlling all floors, the judges are brought to the location due to an execution of drug dealers that tampered with the production of the futuristic drug known as Slo-Mo which when taken puts the user into a state of mind that simulates a reality slowed down to 1% of normal time.When Dredd and his rookie dispatch to location they come upon members who are of such high value that it warrants Ma Ma to take extreme measures to prevent Dredd and his trainee from taking the suspect to interrogation, so they must survive lawless individuals floor by floor in hopes of taking down the leader along with surviving the onslaught.This Dredd is just amazing from start to finish, Karl Urban made the perfect Dredd. Ruthless, unforgiving, and just down right bad ass. Urban's performance really brings Dredd to life.While the movie is plagued with a lot of CGI that distracts the viewer, it is made up in a positive way with copious amounts of blood and violence even horror fans would enjoy.This Dredd is the Judge Dredd we all deserved in 1995, but had to wait for until now.Highly recommended, 8.5 out of 10",Dredd
271,dlracer2,Dark Fantasy Extravagance,10,24 March 2021,"Dredd is a masterclass of visual and cinematic artistry. The plot is simple but engrossing with its ability to engage the audience at all levels from start to finish. The acting couldn't be better. This movie deserved to make so much more than it did because its execution is a rare delight. Everything works, and the ride is surreal. Easy 10 out of 10! Marvelous!!!",Dredd

273,plpregent,200 stories of nonstop mayhem.,7,2 October 2012,"After reading several surprisingly positive reviews for Dredd, I decided to give it a shot. After all, so many people compared this film to the excellent The Raid : Redemption, which I loved.Anyone who's seen the latter can confirm: in terms of storyline and non-stop action, the similarities are beyond obvious. A one-building setting with story-by-story carnage unfolding, a lone hero, a ridiculous bodycount, bad guys committing pure savagery, etc. Throw in a futuristic aspect to the story, a particular drug with the lone purpose of providing cool-looking, ultra-violent bloodshed in slow- motion, and a female antagonist, and you've got Dredd, basically.That being said, I don't mean to say Dredd has nothing special to offer or doesn't possess its very own qualities. The Megacity One setting is pretty compelling and immersive: the building called Peach Trees really translates the whole urban decay depicted in this chaotic world. At one point, you've got one character watching another similar building through a window, as this is just one building filled with criminals among many other gigantic towers, and just another (incredibly bloody) day at the office for the main character. It's subtle and quick, but it brings meaning to a storyline that's mainly built on pure action that could be unfolding anywhere else.Dredd doesn't shy away from what it intends to be: pure entertainment with non-stop, stylish violence featuring a stone- faced hero. Every time you think there's about to be a lengthy or clichéd subplot to potentially slow down the ensemble, it gets shot in the face quicker than you can imagine, literally. The pace is relentless.The characters are nothing that'll make you jump out of your seat. Nonetheless, they're efficiently and boldly introduced to the viewer, who quite frankly won't get to know much more about them than what the first two minutes of their respective screen time will show you. You've got Anderson, the psychic recruit, Dredd, the monolithic judge who's definitely not afraid of knocking doors down, and Ma-Ma, a former hooker turned drug-lord, who happens to be controlling the flow of ""Slo-Mo"" (a powerful drug that makes you feels everything in slow motion) in Megacity One. In terms of performances, the highlight is definitely Lena Headey's, Who plays the drug-fueled, blood thirsty, emotionless Ma-Ma.Now, the whole Slo-Mo thing. It is brilliant. It's the first time since The Matrix where they actually made their slow-motion sequences logical. And not only are they logical, they are visually fun, especially with the 3D. I don't even like this 3D technology, but in this case, this was genuinely used, especially with the great direction, which puts a ton of emphasis on depth of field. Direction is very competent. A lot of visual flashiness is deployed (the first-person view when people are dropped from the upper levels of the building, the lurid photography during the Slo-Mo sequences, the numerous vertiginous shots when the camera travels through hundreds of stories in seconds, etc.). The first pursuit sequence at the beginning of the film is also beautifully photographed. Overall, this is a pretty badass, although not very innovative sci- fi action film. Much better than 1995's ""Judge Dredd"" in all aspects too. Worth a watch if you like being entertained and are not faint- hearted.",Dredd
274,blogurious,So...?,4,12 October 2012,"Once again we are back in the middle of a chaotic future where the only means of survival is complying to either the criminal world or the power of a violent system. ""Dredd"" reminds me a lot of ""The Raid"", except for the high technology available where violence is extremely present. I can't understand the need for a 3D approach, however, in a movie that simply deals with the world of drugs and doomed victims who depend on the powers that be. We are all part of a system that is crumbling little by little and we still have to realize that the futility of our actions are the only thing to blame. Nothing fresh and therefore disappointing.",Dredd
275,jackdeth_2006,The box office bank hides the superb quality of Dredd,9,8 September 2020,"As a kid and comic book fan growing up in the 90's, I really wanted to enjoy Sly's original take. Unfortunately it came up well short.Alas this version, while being a massively superior movie, did not see its success reflected very well at the box office.However, it doesn't change the fact that this film is probably the best Dredd adaption one could possibly have hoped for.The sprawling world of Megacity One doesn't lend itself to a standalone movie, there is just too much going on.Luckily they spotted this and wrote a script that absolutely fitted a good Dredd standalone story. Short, to the point and visually impressive.The cast are excellent. Urban nails the role as usual and one could be forgiven for thinking that he's developed the ability to channel even fictional characters now. Its quite a talent to develop a character when only your chin and mouth is visible.Lena Hedey is genuinely quite scary in her portrayal of Mama. Olivia Thirlby does an excellent job of developing a character sandwiched between a very stoic lead and a very stoic villain.She actually does more for this film than she gets credit for...seriously, watch it and then try and imagine the same film without her.The film is excellently paced and gives you exactly what you should want out of a Dredd film. Plenty of action, an interesting story; and one that accepts the world it is set in rather than trying to over complicate matters with moral quandary for the viewer.It's a claustrophobic film that lands perfectly.I genuinely can't say enough good things about this film.Oh...and Dredd keeps his damn helmet on this time.",Dredd
276,aminjacoub,"Plain Dredd, just Dredd",5,26 December 2012,"Dredd is a simple entertainment for the youth mostly, but it is enjoyable for the most audiences in need of a simple, shallow, yet good action relaxing flick, as well. The earlier version of Dredd forced in something as a plot concept with all that characterization, with weak and funny result, but what I like with this new Dredd is a simple product of high tech movie flick served as a simple flick, balanced with todays high tech movie standards, and nothing more. Just simple action, dare to say pop corn action. It is not just stupid action, not stupid kill em all concept, but naive and predictable, yet original in its own, like a comic book reading, only this time in video frames. Dreed stands in need for simple and entertained action with a bouquet of smart moral concept, which put this movie on a positive track. The sequel is guaranteed and is welcomed from my side of view. So get that pop corn and Coke or Beer, and enjoy.",Dredd
277,haosstoposto,Excellent fun in the 80's style,9,24 September 2012,"At the first glance this movie is a police story cliché. We have a rough veteran cop who administers justice mercilessly (read Dirty Harry squared) and a rookie cop who has one day to prove herself. The setting is also nothing new: They are captured in a (ridiculosly large) building, fighting criminals which reminds of original Die Hard. But the movie itself is executed in superb way. Expostition is very short and the viewer finds out everything about this future world in a few first minutes of the movie. The world is a brutal place and penalties for criminal behavior are swift and draconian, which is shown in 3D on screen. Karl Urban looks very good as a (always unsmiling) hardcore judge and Olivia Thirlby's character shows that all her vulnerability aside she really means it to become law enforcer. Lena Headey's Ma-Ma looks like she is always on sedatives and she portrays the dreamy brutality of her character nicely. The movie itself has a very 80's feel to it, with loud music and depressing interiors. The only modern trait are slow motion scenes which reminds of a music video. Even the duration of the movie is like action movies of the 80's - 90 minutes. Fight scenes are excellent and there are no fillers, everything serves the story. See it and enjoy!",Dredd
278,ticket_for_one,One of my films of the year.,8,21 September 2012,"The future America is an irradiated waste land. On its East Coast, running from Boston to Washington DC, lies Mega City One- a vast, violent metropolis where criminals rule the chaotic streets. The only force of order lies with the urban cops called ""Judges"" who possess the combined powers of judge, jury and instant executioner. Known and feared throughout the city, Dredd (Karl Urban) is the ultimate Judge, challenged with ridding the city of its latest scourge – a dangerous drug epidemic that has users of ""Slo-Mo"" experiencing reality at a fraction of its normal speed.During a routine day on the job, Dredd is assigned to train and evaluate Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), a rookie with powerful psychic abilities thanks to a genetic mutation. A heinous crime calls them to a neighborhood where fellow Judges rarely dare to venture- a 200 story vertical slum controlled by prostitute turned drug lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) and her ruthless clan. When they capture one of the clan's inner circle, Ma-Ma overtakes the compound's control center and wages a dirty, vicious war against the Judges that proves she will stop at nothing to protect her empire. With the body count climbing and no way out, Dredd and Anderson must confront the odds and engage in the relentless battle for their survivalAt last, an actual comic book adaptation. I had my reservations about Dredd – The trailer did little to inspire, which made me think this incarnation might actually be worse than Stallone's horrible campy version.But I'm happy to report Dredd is very good. Not only did it put my fears to rest, but banished any memory I had of Danny Cannon's Judge Dredd. Finally, the Judge Dredd I grew up reading in 2000 AD comics has been rightly portrayed. With so many great films yet to come, I may have to extend my yearly list because of films like Dredd.When I heard that Karl Urban was signed on to play Dredd, I knew it was a good move. Urban embodies Dredd, and has his characteristics down to tee. Even the famous Judge Dredd profile looks exactly how 2000 AD artist Carlos Ezquerra used to illustrate the character. Urban is brilliant in this, and I hope he signs on for the upcoming sequels. Oh wait! If they decide to make any sequels! Lena Headey (Game of Thrones) as Mama does a superb job – she's just a nasty piece of work. Just as her Game of Thrones character but with a bit more bite. In a year where we've had loads male villains, Headey holds her own in Dredd, and puts in a memorable turn as the Mama. Olivia Thirlby offers good support as the daisy faced rookie and the reliable Wood Harris puts in a solid performance as the slimy henchman to Mama.The story in Dredd is very similar to that of The Raid: Redemption. The two judges have to battle their way to the top, to get to Mama. Although I saw The Raid earlier this year, Dredd holds its own when it comes to the set pieces, which are fast, furious and very violent – but almost comically violent?Visual effects are stunning. The use of the 3D Phantom camera in the slow mo scenes looks extraordinary. One of the few films this year I would definitely say is worth seeing in 3D. Mega City One looks beautifully Utopian, which is how it should look. I really like the look of this version of Mega City One. Big, tall, monolithic buildings in a harsh, dystopian environment look visually stunning. Mega City One in the original Dredd film had a sort of Blade Runner look to it, which I didn't appreciate as much. Gone and erased are memories of Stallone torturing Dredd's infamous catchphrase ' I AM DA LAAAHH'! Dredd is an exciting, visceral thrill ride of a movie. Karl Urban puts in one of his best performances as Dredd. The reviews for this have been extremely positive. And I hope the box office viewing public are just as generous. Dredd is faithful to comic book and to its main character.I've given it lots of praise, but Dredd isn't perfect. It drags in several places to focus too much on character development. Plus the film is much longer than it needs to be. Other than that Dredd is awesome and will definitely deserve a second viewing.Good performances, action packed and very violent. I recommend you see Dredd, but it may not be for the faint of heart.",Dredd

The sheer dumbness of comments like this -""Horrible acting, main actor doesn't take off the helmet the entire movie.""are beyond flabbergasting, with the reviewer blissfully uncomprehending of the fact that the helmet is everything, and its removal the ultimate, unpardonable taboo that would have instigated mass backlash of the kind the earlier atrocious Stallone Dredd received. So please desist.As for folks like myself, who grew up with 2000AD and still have have milk crates full of them in the basement, this film was a blessed relief, bringing to life the Dredd we groupies know and love *exactly* as he was on the printed page. Karl Urban was simply perfect, as was Olivia Thirlby as Anderson, a more human counterpoint to the relentless machine that is Dredd.For me, as an unrepentant fan-boy of the comics, this film is a true keeper. Here's hoping the same team is kept if there is a sequel, and rewarded with more budget and freedom to tackle something really big - like the Dark Judges.",Dredd

Self-irony: the movie punches light fun at itself several times 2. The movie takes the time to explain apparently small details (eg: why does Dredd wear a helmet and the girl doesn't? they explain it) 3. The violence is rarely pointless: it goes at lengths to show just how cheap life is (see the beggar's death or the execution of the three dealers that sparks the plot) 4. The environment of the huge block that effectively works as an independent state ruled by MaMa 5. MaMa as a character is rather fascinating. A versed sociopath that doesn't shy away from anything, a woman that rules with an iron fist over an army of criminals, mostly men and still commands their fear and respect. 6. Dredd himself is closer to the books than Stallone ever was. 7. The 'rookie' is played competently, it would have made more sense for the story for her to have died, but apparently she had to live and in the end shows a little evolution for the character of Dredd (indeed, a transgression like getting disarmed by a criminal is a fatal mistake in the world of Dredd, but she has a lot of other qualities that make her valuable enough for a second chance).",Dredd

285,welshnew50,stale & borrowed too many directions from other movies,3,30 November 2016,"This very small part of the series / sci-fi-universe is one that was to always involve more-so than only isolation - enclosure-over-the-individual , in after-death like going-into-ground transitions of death, that were to be a staying-true-to-the-series part of the early character development of the Anderson character.BUT ; not only is not enough of the background gone over in the early introduction to the sci-fi-world ... but a lot of time is wasted on the perspective of the drug users.Also there it is far too much of FPS-game-perspective, when a little more explanation of reasons for the characters decisions as they went about the block would've contextualized OPTIONS/CHOICES.For me, in the comic books, were interesting desperate decisions made, and particularly, how technology's utilization can do different things depending on what tech you're talking about.Although, this movie may well've set up a potential for follow on movies about the Anderson character, particularly in relation to dreams & transitions of things like people IN death.The shock for the Anderson character was there, but so too was far too much touting tough talk - the JD comics concentrated on HOW the ministry of justice ... WORKED.not subtleties of style, in order to sell merchandise.*thumbs down*The workings of the hall, and of experience behind reasons, in questions left UNANSWERED. what should and what should not, be kept behind secrecy and procedure - what was ABOVE Dredd - that made you think.Instead of that, this was like Rambo.sure, good for a blast, but similarly with a character you couldn't really empathize WITH(sorry Vets, but the reality IS different, don't mean to be disrespectful )how do you, with a future sci-fi, anyway.things like background plot and reasons for procedure, are above Dredd - not something he wields, fate-determinedly.in this one, UNlike the Rico clone-plot, there is simplicity of choice.while that's OK in terms of scope, its NOT, in terms of introducing or portraying an entire sci fi series.*thumb down*sure, its was MEANT to be a blast, and too much plot... OK.But on the other hand, for the development of the Anderson character, which was by far more the focus ;...( this movie might as well've been called ""Anderson"" - gets my vote ):)... there could've been at least a few scenes relating to differences of procedure / policy , YET to be formed about psychics.If wanting to portray more of why the policies were deficient, and what was meant to be coming together of two worlds of mutation and GE;then MORE should've been added at the start, end, or at moments when reasons for decisions UPON , or FOR, the public, seemed to her with all her sensitivities inappropriate for needs BEYOND THE PHYSICAL.instead of that, her abilities were FPS 'powers', in weapon-slot B.*double thumbs down*instead, there should've been a lot more shock for her.not the PERSONAL, such as happened when she realized she'd shot the husband/father, but more-so GENERALLY - when thinking about planning.in terms of character development there was to be much more happening mentally / non-physically, within her.UNSEEN FORCES, ( pre-PSI comics that expanded on that later), were perhaps not coming together like rivers, but developing, in opportunities of souls - beyond-death themes - for sons/daughters yet to be - in particularly, a womb-capaciative sense - then more perceiveable, unlike, with psychic men, in these dismal oppertunities in the mess of this particular block.dreams...yes... but perhaps also WHERE , people die.All that, was meant to be BEYOND Dredd - where was all that?I'm talking about extra capacity compared to male psychics especially in terms of ORIGINS of a soul, etc.she was meant to be character-developing.she was having to deny existences - killing in practice, not just theory.While much, much more of that came in more freaky supernatural comics, there was to be a little in this one, in terms of human-isms.inescapabilities of these poor, not personality of the gang members *scoff* , 'countered' , by squad-deployments.Visuals, sound, etc ... all quite good, as were real-isms of the sets, and the general gritty look - dirt everywhere!:)too much, on already narrow/psychopathic gang characters,and too much on the DISEMBODIMENT of those within the block consuming the drug.UNLIKE that, the portrayal of the dying-entrapped , part of the bleakness of these poor, was to be much more a part of going-into a slum/block - for instance, there was no iso-cube portrayal.dialogue was sometimes dull/ needing ranges normalized, and re-assessed by someone that hadn't heard the recording version.a little extra production-cares would've could take care of those minor flaws, in what was still a reasonably-well-framed and spatially-portrayed , set-scene.but the difficulty of understanding WHAT ... before even being able to understand WHY ... for many things, for a lot/some of the audience, will continue to make this story less well appreciated beyond its directly subjective topics - drugs, death, mandated-power, etcthe actual comic , was meant to be much more about as i said, the UNSEEN, in Anderson - not just a member with powers.There was meant to be dissatisfaction and disgust - not just expecting to be failed but-still-accepting Dredd's decision - compliance, in other words.she was meant to be dismayed and disenchanted , bleakly disappointed, etc.REW",Dredd
286,cultjones,The Grateful Dredd,7,11 February 2013,"Directed by Pete Travis, Dredd is the second attempt to transfer the cult comic hero to the big screen. In 1995, Sylvester Stallone donned the mantle of the wide jawed crime fighter however, even with the star power, the movie bombed. The 2012 rendition, which was in 3D had a steep hill to climb if it hoped to get out from under the debacle of it's 1995 relative.Dredd and a Mutant Rookie with psychic abilities end up in the Peach Trees Mega Block on a triple homicide call. In apprehending the perpetrators the Judges inadvertently arrest a high ranking lieutenant of the drug cartel. Fearing he would divulge the cartel's secrets, the Mega Block is locked down as the two Judges become targets that can't be allowed to leave at any cost.Karl Urban doesn't have the clout of the veteran, Stallone but he does play the role of the Judge perfectly well. In fact, there are no standouts in the cast as they all perform their roles flawlessly. The clever thing about Dredd is that it doesn't try to be too clever! It tells a story that is filled with action and complimented by well-portrayed characters. There is also some great cinematography, which would've made Dredd one of the few movies worth watching in 3D!Unfortunately Dredd couldn't get out from the 1995 disaster as it bombed at the box office in spite of the positive reviews. It's a shame because Urban and team could've had an unexpected franchise comparable to Guillermo Del Toro's Hellboy. Dredd is definitely worth a watch.",Dredd
287,tarekali-19909,"Dredd hands down deserves a sequel,",10,26 May 2020,"The 'original' Stallone Dredd outing was a fun but goofy take on a serious world. It served a purpose but it felt contrived.
The Karl Urban take on Dredd seems authentic and plausible, a reasonable projection of the world as we know it today, with little fantasy or whimsy.
Urban's Dredd is near perfection as a movie, a pair of ethical, principled cops grinding away at a massive crime organization, one floor at a time.
The brutal simplicity of the Dredd justice, with its instant death sentences, is definitely abhorrent to the current climate of clemency for even the most savage criminals. However Dredd represents a civilization on the edge of collapse, and the punishment fits the crimes. There are many parallels to our times.
As an action movie, the brilliant cat and mouse game played out in mega tower PeachTrees is on the same level as the first Die Hard. Even on rewatching, I appreciate the survival and justice dispensation skills of our 2 protagonists.
Something must be said about Anderson, played so brilliantly by Olivia Thirlby. She does not necessarily represent the kinder, gentler side of the law as might be stereotypical, she represents in a way the smarter and more subtle form of the law, one that uses mind control and manipulation to further the cause. I really related to her embattled, sorrowful character, and her desperate desire to become a Judge.

It may not live up to the very best of its kind, but when, at around the half-way mark, the writers steal an iconic line from Robocop, I had to admit, ""yep, fair play, it's earned the right to do that"".

You might think that they can't do much by basically having the story in one location,but you would be WRONG! How this movie wasn't a blockbuster is beyond me,but if any movie DESERVES A SEQUEL...this one DOES! In the modern era of ""superhero movies"",this movie feels the most realistic and somewhat plausible. HECK...I'm going to fire it up right now for the UMP-TEENTH time. If you HAVEN'T seen it,do yourself a favor and WATCH IT! Toodles.",Dredd
291,ben-798-604758,"Straight to The Point, Well Directed, Really Violent",8,25 September 2013,"This definitely isn't one of those movies with a lot of character development, but its not your typical action flick either. This is a beautiful work of art with a lot of stylized violence, desolate alleys with shady characters and ill intentions. The grungy neon lights of a dystopian future, the scarlet blood and glimmering glass, the hauntingly beautiful slow motion, what makes this movie great is definitely the visual aspects.Dredd himself is very one dimensional, forcedly so. Stern, analytical, gruff, his toughness masking a side of him the audience never actually gets to see. His character is described perfectly in the first few minutes by his new psychic apprentice, which is the last look you get inside of his head before its slammed shut. He is a man who takes his duty seriously to the point that it consumes him, defines him.Ma-ma is sadistically brilliant. Her mob-style domination of peach tree creates a claustrophobic apprehension for a threat far too big to take on in a box far too small to escape. The terror by which she controls the people is believable and vicious. Whats lost in character development is regained by the subtle twisted moments and reactions to the threats imposed on each of the characters.The psychic scenes were perhaps the most well done and paints a very nice psychological battle between the judge in training and her prisoner. I would've actually enjoyed more of these as they were very surreal and artistic. Its also cool to see the way she breaks him down even after he thinks he has the upper hand.Slow mo, the drug this movie centers around, makes for some very awesome fight scenes on par with Sherlock Holmes 2: a Game of Shadows and the Matrix. The visual effects were very well executed and i myself being a visual effects artist, have only one complaint. At some points the blood was a bit oversaturated and toonish, which was likely in attempt to match the comic but draws away from a few scenes.",Dredd
292,jabrbi,Ultra-Violent,6,2 April 2014,"Judge Dredd is a British invention, created in response to the civil unrest in the UK during the 1970's. The world of Dredd is set after a global nuclear holocaust, a dystopian future full of violence, crime, poverty and unemployment. The stories are full of crime fighting, laced with dark humour, irony, and sending up American culture.Since Americans don't get irony, are terrible at dark humour and their pride prevents them from sending themselves up, we're left, in this film, with the ultra violence. And that's no bad thing, as this film manages to capture the world of Dredd, albeit without a single laugh.From the very beginning this film lets loose the dogs of war. There are so many gun shots that the state of California must have been emptied of bullets for a whole month. And the scene where they let loose the big cannons is epic.First, the bad news. The overall look of the Megacity is disappointing. It's not claustrophobic enough, and the level of technology is only a couple of decades in advance of today. However, that said, that's really the only bad news about the film.Luckily most of the action takes place in a Megacity block, so the dirt, filth, and degradation is fully exploited as background to the simple story of taking down a drug gang. The block is a great depiction of the Megacity I expected and wanted; graffiti everywhere, nothing but concrete, dull colours, basic living standards.But the story isn't where the fun is. It's the relentless violence, the instant dispatch of justice, a fast pace, and only seeing Dredd's mouth, never the eyes. If you know Dredd from the comic strip, then you'll love this depiction.Sure, there is character development in the shape of Judge Anderson, seen here as a rookie and not the uber-confident experienced Psi Judge she becomes. There's a villain who doesn't hold back, neither side gives an inch, and political correctness has gone out of the window (along with lots of bodies). And there's the unsmiling Dredd. Everybody else in the film is dispensable.At last we have the type of ultra-violent film that America is loathe to produce - simply because it limits the target audience. This is an adult film, make no mistake, with over-the-top violence and effects, but it hits the spot big time.",Dredd
293,S_dot_M_dot,Awesome Action,8,26 August 2021,"In a futuristic city, where violence reigns supreme, Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) responds to crime and brings rookie Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) for her first day on the job. While inside Mega City Peach Tree, they meet a ruthless gang lead by Ma-Ma (Lena Headey), and a new drug SLO-MO that is sweeping the city.This has graphic novel written all over it. From the production design, cinematography, violence, pacing; it plays as a visual comic. The addition of SLO-MO adds a stylistic element that brings a touch of beauty to the grim landscape. As I mentioned before, this film is action packed and over the top violence so viewer be warned.I enjoyed the entire cast in this film. Urban's portrayal of Dredd brings a believable enforcer to the screen. Thirlby plays the apprehensive rookie who comes into her own and doles out her fair share of justice. As Ma-Ma, Headey brings a laid back vibe to a heartless killer you can root against. The supporting cast also plays a good role in pushing the story when needed.The biggest drawback is not watching in 3-D. Since the film was shot that way, it can leave you with some gimmicky shots that don't translate well. The CGI is fantastic throughout but some aspects seem to not blend as well as others. Being based off a graphic novel, you can overlook these shortcomings.At a 95 minute runtime, Dredd is full throttle from start to finish. A great cast, well thought out set pieces, and a straight forward plot, this is a must watch for any fans of the genre.",Dredd
294,rsj624,B-Rated Bliss at it's Best,9,10 October 2013,"--WARNING: There may be some spoilers ahead for those who haven't seen the film, so just a heads up. In order to accurately review this film, it may be necessary to talk about some key moments.--Dredd is B-rated cyber-punk fluff at it's greatest. This isn't a movie you should be looking for the logic in, or even any stand out performances, aside from Keith Urban, who more than nails the character of Judge Dredd. For anyone familiar with the Silvester Stallone film, this one couldn't be more opposite. It's not aiming for the blockbuster demographic nearly as much as it is the cult audience with a bias towards quirky and trying genre films that excel at ridiculous concepts. Dredd is very episodic in it's brief runtime and centers around Dredd and a rookie Judge attempting to track down Mama, the ring leader of the Peach Tree district who may be linked to the production and dispersion of Slo-Mo, which is rapidly adding to the decay of an already vastly decayed society. The whole film takes place almost entirely in one building.As thin as the plot is, there aren't any complaints I can muster up regarding it. If you look for the loop-holes or the pit falls in logic, you're most likely going to miss all the good stuff happening on screen. One could scrutinize how it is that the effects of slo-mo seem to wear off instantaneously for some the minute something dramatic happens in the film, yet when given to anyone thrown off a ledge, the torment and adrenaline that i'm sure is experienced somehow can't possibly shake slo-mo's effect, at least as far as this films concerned, but, it is pointless to even care.Dredd doesn't have an Oscar in mind, it has a very niche crowd it's playing up to, and more appropriately so given the source material it is based upon. It's rare that a film comes along like this one and is almost as serious a joke towards itself a film could be and still manage to be a respectable experience. Dredd succeeds where few films of it's nature can, it's cheesy, low brow, and even funny in a dark dark way, but as blatantly as it plays up to all these low standards, it can't help but be a great watch.",Dredd
295,jacoblawrence-19058,"Judge, Jury, and Executioner",5,16 November 2021,"Incredibly violent and unnecessarily gory at times, Dredd plays out like a cross between an early 2000s video game and The Raid (although The Raid is a much better film!). Urban plays the part about as well as you can play a role that shows no emotion, not to mention his face.With minimal backstory and character development, I just wasn't sure why I should care. The viewer gets absolutely no setup knowledge outside of a quick voice over at the very beginning. Then we're thrust into the middle of a conflict wondering how we got there and feeling uninvested. If you're a die-hard fan of the original and you need to see how the reboot stacks up, then go ahead. Ultimately though, Dredd feels like a miss.Verdict: Don't Watch.",Dredd
296,alucard_castlevania86,The Law Fits better in Karl Urban's Hands,8,20 September 2012,"Just came back from watching Dredd 3D and I have to say, its a really good film. The story was easy to understand and doesn't try to complicate itselfKarl Urban cements his role as Judge Dredd excellently compared to Sly's version back in the 90's. He makes the character look more mysterious and menacing throughout the entire movie by not taking his helmet off. He is the true Judge Dredd in my opinion. The girl who played Judge Anderson was good too and well as the other characters. The theme music for was the the best score for the film. Its full of adrenaline rush and thats when the action gets underway This is definitely my top rated 5 movie of the year and one I will surely go to see again. Hope that a squeal will follow out from this one because this movie truly deserves one. Overall, an 8 out 10 for me",Dredd

298,gy-att,One of the worst movies of my life,3,12 January 2013,"Im shocked that it got that high rating here. This movie is worst than most low cost B movies on the market. It looks cheap, the fake CGI blood looks awkward and Dredd always make the Grumpy Cat Face. Seriously. Why does he always has to make that face? Stallone wasn't making any faces, his face like that always. Actors acting like amateurs. There is nothing(!) in this movie that could entertain anyone. I thought I won't see worst ""blockbuster"" movie than Total Recall (2012) but Dredd is worst than that. Oh and the whole concept was stolen from the movie called Raid: Redemption (which is FYI a very good movie). 3 points, and I was generous!",Dredd
299,Kolorgasm,Violently Entertaining!,8,28 December 2012,"Dredd is one of my favorite action films of 2012 and it is added on my favorite sci-fi flicks. Full of violence, adventure, action, magic and thrill, this film will definitely open your mind to a whole new world. The whole film is somehow realistic compared to what is happening now, in our present world. The dystopian setting and its bloody nature gives the film a thrilling feel and it makes you somehow afraid of what's going to happen next. In the shortest term, the film is effective. Dredd is one of the smartest action-films I've ever seen. The cluelessness of the audience at what year it is in the film is a good feature because it doesn't give the audience the feeling of being too far from the present time. The small of amount of visual and futuristic effects on the setting (Mega City One) is also a good thing because it sends out the message to the audience that the film is not trying too hard or exaggerated about the future, it just adds to the violent and dark nature of the setting. I love the fact that the design of the whole film isn't too futuristic and it doesn't stray too far from the present time, and that the gadgets and devices from the film are not trying to look very easy to use and somehow a little bit hard to operate, that gives the film the perspective that the future—in the film—is not too advance and that is somehow relatable to the audience. Karl Urban's portrayal of Judge Dredd is so effective that you will think that the character is ruthless and soft at the same time. Olivia Thirlby portrays her role of Cassandra ""Rookie"" Anderson finely; she's inexperienced when it comes to ""judgment"" and yet, she can handle herself even by just being alone. She's tough and unpredictable, and her psychic ability gives you an exciting sense of adventure. Lena Headey portrays Ma-Ma very effectively, for most action films where males are the main antagonists; Ma-Ma turns the table around. I love the fact that the cliché of rumble-between-the-hero-and-the-villain didn't occur in the end and that Judge Dredd went straight for what he's headed for, I think that's a good change, it makes the film even more unpredictable. The elements of the film are balanced; it's not too much and it's not less either. The music is great and spices up the film pretty nicely. Definitely, one of the most entertaining action films in our generation, this film gives you unexpected possibilities and eye-opening scenarios.",Dredd
300,thefilmdiscussion,Dredd 3D is fantastic B-movie fun,7,25 September 2012,"""Dredd 3D"" is one of the best sci-fi actioners I've seen this side of the millennium. Karl Urban plays Judge Dredd, a ruff n' tuff cop in a violent future where his employer, The Hall of Justice, dispatches judges to extract justice on the lawbreakers of Mega City One, a sprawling wasteland of concrete and crime from Boston to the Capitol. These judges have been given the power of judge, jury, and executioner, so you don't cross them. On the day of the film, Dredd takes up a rookie cop (Olivia Thirlby) to train in the ways of 20xx law enforcement. As a bonus, she's a psychic, which comes in handy in quite a few situations, of course. They answer a homicide call at a 200-story futuristic project, where the crime boss Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) has taken complete control. Afraid that the cops will edge in on her drug business (Slo-Mo, which makes the brain fell as if it's experiencing life at 1% normal speed – this allows for some absolutely amazing sequences of slow-motion photography and violence), she hacks the building and locks them in, with one ultimatum over the loudspeaker: The doors won't open til the cops are dead. And that's the rest of the movie, a wonderfully action- packed wallop of stylistic violence and gore that understands it's a high-end B-movie and revels in it. The dialogue is so gruff and packed with machismo that you're guaranteed to grow chest hair by the film's end. What pulls this film up to a higher notch is the care given to the look and gadgets of the players. The judges' armor is incredibly intimidating, and their guns are a marvel that never stops surprising. The violence is intense and in-your-face (literally, if you see it in 3D, which I fully recommend, surprisingly), and the final result is a film that is so much fun you'll forget that it doesn't mean much when it's over.-Thomas Bond, TheFilmDiscussion",Dredd

It brings in one of the most interesting worlds of lore out there: Judge Dredd in Mega City One by 2000AD Comics. Really well casted. If i had to say any shortcomings of this films would be very breifly there are time when it can be considered too graphic. Also as a now huge fan of the Judge Dredd universe, i will say Mega City one has always been its own character (the place, the citizens, the crime). With that said the movie doesnt dive into the character of Mega City one as much as i would like. Amazing film of action, grit, and art.",Dredd
302,richy1024,Futuristic judge doesn't need any jury,4,23 September 2012,"Comic book bonanza Judge Dredd becomes the latest supplementary addition to the list of the multiple remake movies occurring recently as Karl Urban fills the shoes of Sly in this futuristic glamorisation of violence and over elaboration Stalone's ever existent poor performances. By employing Urban we can see the resemblance in how he enjoys towing his jaw to one side, replicating Sylvester's dissatisfaction of felony law breakers. Even staging the dramatics in 3D dimension unfortunately waves a level of dissatisfaction over a poor screenplay that Garland must have wrote whilst in the company of Sly demonstrating his range of 'acting talent'. Unfortunately for Urban he has become the experiment of another monotone tribulation that will leave cinema goers feeling the complete opposite of being flattered by the experience.The only component to give credit to is the film's digitally enhanced capacity. The canvas is quite remarkable; the use of exploitive art gives us a picturesque splatter that will remind parents of their toddler's capabilities with a paint brush. The colour is vibrant and flush, providing us with an eye-catching tone of quality, adding excitement to the tone of the film with an irrevocable stain of vitality. This artistic approach provokes plenty of energy around death and violence with an ample amount of ruby escalating across the screen with the enhanced use of slow motion bullet shots through the cheeks of Dredd's casualties. Although the radiance of blush is particularly eye catching and aggressive, it can only be described as a template that paints over the cracks of the narrative. The only characters who derives pleasure from any progression is Olivia Thirlby's Anderson, as we learn she is a foreign mind reader who exploits the psyche of her dupes by either outlining their next move or understanding the rationale behind their devilish antics. The use slow motion is over-emphasised, although this method highlights the extraordinary nature of high definition it consequently extends the length of a camera shot at an uncomfortable tempo, lengthening the overall time of the show and being unaware of how the audience can only obtain negligence from such techniques as they occur rather frequently in this picture.The story covers literally three pages of scripture; Dredd is partnered with a junior who both become trigger friendly exterminators as they find themselves sheltered within a dodgy complex of 75,000 civilians owned by a glorified underworld aristocrat, former prostitute who lures herself around visceral reliability and disposing of all living 'integrities' of the law. Not once do the judges fulfil an accurate arrest, they tie their only capture up for three quarters of an hour before severing his right hand a placing a pullet through his head. Speaking of bullets, try not to tally these up as not even a pro-bullet mathematician would have the numeric capabilities of counting the quantity of metal projectiles used, so much for handcuffs and truncheons.",Dredd
303,maddog-50,Too colorful,3,10 September 2012,"although this movie is better than the Stallone one, it has some major flaws. Scripting wise it comes much more closer to the true Dredd. The Stallone version was really more like a childish comic adaption, this one obviously was meant to be much more grim, but what you see is a colorful comic-like cinematography again which doesn't fit to Dredd feeling and to the script at all. Karl Urban is a perfect cast for Dredd, his female co's are quite the opposite. Especially soccer mum Lena Headey almost ruins the show. It seems like they couldn't decide if they should make a kids movie or a bad-ass action movie. The action sequences are childish, the satirical undertone and social criticism of the comic, especially given by some over blown brutality, is completely missing. The comic is quite intelligent and deep, this movie is a lightweight. It could have been so much better, unfortunately it isn't.",Dredd

310,gallae,True to the Comics,8,9 November 2012,"Saw DREDD yesterday. Glad I did. Been a DREDD fan since the early 80s. Am so glad this film got made.This film got so much right - not in exact looks of the comics, but in a ""Batman Begins"" style of character and effect. Unlike the Stallone film (which borrowed the plot from Demolition Man) Dredd doesn't talk too much, and doesn't remove his helmet (the only times he did in the strips you either couldn't see his face clearly of he had a disguise on). The plot seems right, having Anderson as a Rookie means that we get to see how the Judges reason and how they behave.If there's anything missing from the film it's any sense of humour. Don't expect to see any ""Ugly Clinics"" or ""Unk's Candy Bars"", or Dredd's robotic butler Walter, but you will see LOTS of violence with people being shot in numerous ways, skinned, defenestrated, stabbed, and otherwise killed in messy ways. Although the 3D effects are a bit gimmicky they're used well, with droplets on intervening window panes, or spraying out into your lap as people get thrown places.I loved Dredd's understatements and reactions throughout the film - he doesn't lose his cool at all. I hope they make lots of $$$ and make a couple of sequels. I've read somewhere that if they do #2 will be THE CURSED EARTH (a 2000AD take on Damnation Alley) and #3 would be JUDGE DEATH (which was likely to have been the plot of a 2nd Stallone film).

312,tyreeewebster,Retro-spective Reviews- Dredd (2012),10,14 September 2012,"Once upon a time, in 1977 a British anthology comic- book was created called '2000AD', featuring a large selection of sci- fi stories, and one of those stories featured Judge Dredd, a grumpy, fascist street judge who can kill or arrest criminals as he wishes. 18 years later, in 1995 a movie was made of it starring Sylvester Stallone and Rob Schneider... we ain't talking about that one.This updated version is dark, gritty, violent and completely insane! The violence in this movie is over the top, yes, but it fits in with the story so well, this is one of those action movies that actually has a reason for the gratuitous blood and guts for the story, and not just to make the guys happy, it has brains and bravado. The story is very simple for a film of its type. Judge Dredd (played to perfection by KARL KURBAN) is assessing a rookie (played by OLIVIA THIRLBY) on her first day as a street judge, but the 2 end up in the wrong place in the wrong time, in this case, a tall building known as Peach Trees, and they must shoot their way to the top of the building to get to the drug ""Lord"" Ma- Ma, who is manufacturing and selling a drug known as Slo- Mo, which makes everything in your world go to cool slow motion. It's basically 'DIE HARD' in a way.The story isn't anything special, and neither are the performances, Karl Urban is really awesome as Dredd, delivering an emotionless character who doesn't change throughout the film, he doesn't learn any life lessons, he just stays the same, which I thought was really different for a hero. Olivia Thirlby was okay as Anderson the Rookie, she didn't offer anything special, but I didn't really expect her to. But the highlight of it all was Leana Headey as the villain, Ma- Ma, she is one of the greatest comic book movie villain of all, in my honest opinion, she was quirky, threatening and mysterious, and that's what made her steal the show for me.If you're a fan of the comic 'Judge Dredd', or even the original movie, I advise you to see this, in 3D, as well. But if you're not a fan of the original source material, and just a sucker for action movies, then see it anyway. You won't be disappointed.'DREDD' Directed by: Pete Travis Written by: Alex Garland Starring: Karl Urban, Olivia Thirlby, Wood Harris and Leana Headey",Dredd
313,Lugodoc,Perfect Dredd,10,7 September 2012,"I'm a huge fan of the comic 2000AD and the character Judge Dredd since 1979, and this film completely satisfied me. They changed all the right things and kept all the right things. Director Pete Travis tackled the problem of filming a comic book by making something that looks nothing like a comic book and more like an action movie shot on location, with a simple linear plot that keeps rolling and never slows down.Megacity 1 is made markedly less futuristic than the comic in order to become so believable that it is hard to tell where the real slums of Cape Town end and the CGI kilometre high city blocks start. I have an uncomfortable feeling that in less than a hundred years cities like this may actually exist.The comic Judge's uniform works on paper but can't in real life - giant golden eagles, shoulder pads and bronze name badges hanging off a leather one-piece body suit would sag, wobble and look daft. The movie gives us body armour that looks like it actually gets used whilst keeping the helmet exactly the same. The effect is striking and believable, like everything else in this film.The plot revolves around a drug which makes time seem to slow down a hundred times, the perfect excuse for scenes of ultra slo-mo explosive bloody (and beautiful) anatomically correct violence that earn this film its 18 rating. Not a kid's movie at all. Every supporting actor looks like they came out of a gang documentary, scarred, nasty, sweaty and mean. Lena Headey totally kicks ass as the ruthless gang lord Ma Ma, calmly relishing the deaths of her enemies, eyes sledging from narcotic addiction.In a way this is Olivia Thirlby's movie, since she gets the character arc, rookie judge Cassandra Anderson assigned to Dredd for evaluation and finding herself on a very steep learning curve. She is vulnerable, spikey and tough as called for, vital to the movie in order to balance Dredd.How do you play Dredd? He is the opposite of a character. He has no personal arc, never changes or grows. He has no sense of humour, the comic finds that by placing utterly deadpan 'ol stony- face in ironic situations that reflect off him. And where do you find an actor prepared to wear a helmet obscuring everything but his mouth and chin for the whole 95 minutes? Karl Urban must be a huge fan himself to play the part so right. One reviewer described his performance as ""ego-free"" and it is. I didn't see Urban anywhere in this movie, all I saw was Dredd.Me and Dredd-heads everywhere thank you Karl. You smashed it.",Dredd
314,bobrandt,The future looks bleak and dull...,1,9 October 2012,"It's always hard with movies based on books. Reading the books, each person creates their own internal images of what they're reading. It's an impossible task for a director to recreate something that is identifiable by everyone. But wait... Dredd is based on a comic book, with pretty darn good drawings of everything. There's even another movie that got it right with the uniforms and the Lawmaster bikes. Was the director unaware of this when choosing how to portray Dredd's world? Just add water! The visuals are given and only needed a bit of polish. Guess they filmed it in the projects down the block? What could have been added was some true dilemma and depth. The director missed on so many count, this movie should have been judged!",Dredd
315,Ben_Horror,Combine the attitude/violence of Robocop with the cityscapes of Bladerunner and you've got DREDD!,9,10 September 2012,"It's surprising that for an iconic comic book legend like Judge Dredd, a tent-pole character in the equally iconic 2000AD comic - which itself has been around since the 1970s - there's been just one movie adaptation: a 1995 vehicle starring Sylvester Stallone, where he famously removed the sacred helmet of the character (a strict no-no in the comic) and spent most of the movie's running time as a fleeing fugitive rather than as a 'Judge' out in Mega City One dispensing brutal justice. It was a flop at the time, not in the least bit helped by someone as famous and larger than life as Stallone playing an equally famous and larger than life character like Judge Dredd.The good news is that Dredd 3D is a massive improvement over the Stallone version. Firstly, Karl Urban makes for a more effective and menacing Dredd. Secondly, the helmet stays ON for the movie's entire running time – a rarity in today's world of celebrity egos that an actor would actually agree to that. The story is way better too: Dredd and a rookie Judge called 'Anderson' are called to a tower block where three people have been skinned alive and thrown to their deaths. Unbeknownst to Dredd and Anderson, this block is run by a major crime lord - 'Ma-ma'(seriously) – who's manufacturing a drug called 'Slo-Mo' there – a narcotic that slows down time for the user. After Dredd and Anderson arrest one of her perps, Ma-ma opts to shut down the entire building rather than letting Dredd and Anderson leave with her stooge, effectively making them prisoners in the block and forcing them to shoot/fight/blow their way out of this hell hole.Although this is meant to be a review of Dredd 3D, it's almost impossible to resist comparing it to the Stallone movie. As mentioned above, Karl Urban is great as the eponymous Dredd and puts in a better interpretation of the character than the Stallone iteration. Witness the delivery of Dredd's iconic and immortal line: whereas in the 1995 release Stallone shouted: ""I am (pause) The Law!""; in this version, Urban growls it more effectively: ""I am the Law!"". Also, in the comics, Dredd sometimes almost came across as being a futuristic Dirty Harry – a fact lost in the 1995 movie, but corrected in this version: here we see Dredd throw people to their deaths/execute/head butt/punch his way out of danger. In essence, it's everything you would expect from the classic comic icon and a lot of that is thanks to Urban's steely portrayal.It may be dark and murky, but it's still a very stylish (and stylized) movie. The effects of the Slo-Mo drug are stylistically rendered, with everything happening at a fraction of the speed of reality. As a comic book adaptation, it even resembles a comic book with its parade of contorted faces, arms and torsos being shot and/or shredded in extreme slow motion and usually in close up. So much so, you could almost imagine it as a panel on a comic page with the accompanying 'Thud!' or 'Ka-pow!' captions.As Anderson the rookie, Olivia Thirlby puts in a good, not too showy performance. Anderson is a mutant possessing psychic powers and there are some effective and imaginative scenes where she utilizes them to full effect. There's also a very poignant moment where the full gravity of being a Judge hits her for the first time, as her psychic powers hammer home a sad realization to her based on her performing the compulsory duties of a judge. It's details like this that make this movie several notches above other comic book movies like it.It also even seems to have been informed by the Christopher Nolan take on Batman/The Dark Knight: everything is gritty and grounded in realism, and Urban's growling delivery of the dialog is not exactly dissimilar to Christian Bale's own take on delivering dialog when in Batman mode. Both also share a similar ruthlessness when trying to 'obtain' a confession/ information from a suspect. There are a few small minuses: the Judge Dredd of the comic was a proud, dedicated lawman, who was committed to his job with military efficiency; therefore it doesn't really make sense that he would show up for duty in a dusty uniform and a beaten, scratched helmet. Similarly, while they may have got the design of the aforementioned helmet right, they've taken some large detours from the original design of the uniform: gone is the eagle from the right shoulder; instead, it's been worked in as a kind of padding. Worse, the iconic bike – the 'Lawmaster' – looks cheap and none too powerful. This was one of the few elements the 1995 version almost got right. And if you really want to nitpick, in one scene, Urban says, ""Sh*t!"" Everyone knows that in that particular scene, he should have actually said ""Stomm!"" or ""Drokk!"" - Dredd's trademark swear words. Even the plot bears an absolutely uncanny resemblance to that of another of this year's releases: The Raid. Just substitute gunfights for the balletic martial arts on display in that film, and you've almost got the same movie. Hell, even the look and the music score are similar. The makers of Dredd must have had sunken spirits when they saw it. As Dredd was made first, the jury's out on exactly what – if anything – is going on, but this has to be the most unbelievable case of psychic plagiarism ever seen. Which is a shame, because if The Raid hadn't existed, this would have been brilliant rather than just great. But don't let that put you off. Dredd is still a super and very noisy comic book movie that will keep you gripped to the very end. If this is the beginning of a trilogy/series, then it's off to a good start. See it now.",Dredd
316,darkraven_109,Close to Action Movie Perfection,8,23 September 2012,"I've never read any of the JUDGE DREDD comics since they're so hard to locate in the country I live in and even if I only had a vague understanding about the Dredd character, I was still able to immensely enjoy DREDD 3D. Any worries about it being as bad as the Sylvester Stallone vehicle way back in the 90's were all shot down in the opening chase scene. The story is simple and it fulfills its purpose as being the foundation for a good action movie. At least unlike most ""action"" movies of this decade, the plot doesn't waste time exploring too many character threads like romance or convoluted government conspiracies that slow down the whole movie. Karl Urban nailed the badass character very well and as others have said before me, Urban is Dredd. The rest of the cast do their job well though Ma-Ma could've used some more screen time. But the main reason why this movie was enjoyable for me was because DREDD 3D is a B-action movie with all upgrades this decade could offer. One-liners, sarcasm, non-stop action, brutality... all of the elements that made the 90's actions movies so great are present here with all of the improvements one could hope for. It's as great a refresher as EXPENDABLES 2 was in a time of PG-13 ""action"" garbage. From start to finish the action is as brutal as one could hope for, though it's a bit sad that there isn't enough of this stuff going around in the movie. Instead, what we have are admittedly great visualizations of the Slo-Mo drug but some of these shots were unnecessary even if they looked cool. The 3D effects weren't utilized to their full potential which was a waste since special effects wise, DREDD 3D has some of the best low-budget effects (estimated movie budget is around $45 million only) I've seen. I just wished that the crew behind the movie decided to use more shootouts than Slo-Mo influenced sequences. DREDD 3D is not the best action movie ever made but so far it's one of the best one one I've seen this year (that and THE RAID). This is how action movies should be and this movie is a godsend. The sad thing is I doubt a sequel will ever be greenlit since by the looks of it, DREDD 3D is going to (at worst) tank at the box office since no matter how cool the movie is, a fanbase dedicated to what some could call a ""cult hero"" won't be able to salvage DREDD's income. Either that or people have bad memories of the Stallone JUDGE DREDD movie. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie.",Dredd
317,reguizar,I know that story,2,1 May 2020,"Great cinematography but the story is so much like ""The raid"" (2011) With different technology with a great performance by Lena Headey the lack of creativity in the script got me of interest",Dredd
318,mockfilmreviews,One of the most entertaining comic book adaptations ever.,9,24 January 2016,"I'm writing this review with a slight ulterior motive in mind. My intentions will soon be revealed. Please be patient.It was a warm September day in the year 2012. Having the day off from work, I decided that it was time to break a rule that I set in place years prior, I was going to see a movie... ALONE! Before then, I scoffed at those lonely folks sitting silently in a theater, not able to scrounge up even a modest acquaintance to accompany them to the cinema. But as time goes by, people change. Tastes change. Beliefs change. And it was on this very day that, I am glad to admit, I grew as a person. Or at least as a film lover.I arrived early, bought my favorite snacks, chose a center seat, not too far, not to close, and got ready to do nothing more than give my full attention to the feature presentation. With nobody there to ask a question about the film or an ear to whisper a witty quip to mid-picture, I was about to have a true movie going experience. And I could not have picked a better movie.Based on the comic series Judge Dredd, Dredd (2012) stars Karl Urban (Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King 2002, Star Trek 2009) in the title role of judge, jury, and executioner in a violence ridden city in the post apocalyptic future. Judges, as they are called, perform swift and deadly justice in order to keep the overcrowded populace from getting out of hand. The landscape of the picture feels both confined and vast, as citizens are housed in Mega Towers, giant slum apartment building, that make up smaller communities, each with their own criminal element.Put in charge of a psychic rookie judge (Olivia Thirlby) on her first day, Dredd and his new partner are called upon to investigate a group of murders in one of the Mega Towers. An obvious gang hit, the judges go after the local drug lord of the tower, Ma-Ma, played sadistically perfect by Lena Headey (Game of Thrones 2011). But she won't go down that easy. Hacking the building security system, she locks our heroes in and announces a bounty on whoever brings them to her.",Dredd
319,asha-albert,Fans of the comic book....rejoice!,7,23 September 2012,"Yay for the much-needed reboot of the Judge Dredd movie. The earlier version starring Sylvester Stallone and horrifyingly enough, Rob Schneider, was a uneasy mashup of sci-fi and comedy...and pretty much bombed at the box-office, as it deserved to.The re-boot is everything that the earlier version was not. Its dark, its gritty, its violent and brutal...and it doesn't even try to be funny. The movie is set in a dystopian vision of the future....the world has been ravaged by nuclear war, and the survivors live in mega-cities, most of which are nothing but vertically-rising slums. Law and order is managed by the Judges, who are a combination of police, judge, jury and sentencer all in one, thereby being all-powerful.Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is the most ruthless of all the judges, and on this particular day, is paired up with a trainee judge who is on probation. She also has psychic powers, and her career will be decided by Dredd at the end of the day. They get into a run-in with Ma-Ma, a powerful ganglord (Lena Headey), who lords it over Peachtrees, a 200-storey slum in the heart of MegaCity 1. She is the main distributor for Slo-Mo, a new drug that slows down your perception of time to 1% of real time.How Dredd and the trainee destroy Ma-Ma and her gang is what forms the basis of the story. Set mainly inside the slum building, and punctuated by scenes of extreme brutality - beheading, skinning, torture, eye-gouging, castration - and of course, plain old exploding bodies, the movie is dark, dingy and claustrophobic. The special effects showing the slo-mo views are amazing, and the 3D is an enhancement. The design of the cities, especially that of the slum, is awesome and actually believable. The overall tone of the movie is so true and close to the spirit of the Judge Dredd comic series.Urban is perfect as the unemotional Dredd, who may or may not be hiding an emotional core - while he does not shy away from killing criminals on the spot, he is unable to tolerate the killing of innocents. Since his face is hidden behind the helmet throughout the movie, he has to rely on his voice, raspy and reminiscent of Clint Eastwood - I AM THE LAW. Olivia Thirby is an effective rookie judge, struggling with her fears and ambitions. Headey is getting better and better at playing ""bad girls"" - Cersei Lannister anyone? Here she is a horribly scarred, psychotic killer, high and strung-out most of the time.The movie was rather short (just under 2 hours) and my interest did not flag even once, considering that most of the movie is set inside one single building. For this, and for being true to the comic series, its a 7/10.",Dredd
320,nikhil-damodaran,Unexpectedly decent,6,22 June 2013,"Into the first ten minutes of the movie and i was thinking it would turn out to be a funny serious movie. A protagonist with a headgear on all the time is going to be no fun! The movie is set in a futuristic world where you have these tall 200 storied sky scrapers where thousands of people inhabit one colony of a sky scraper. Then there are crimes and criminals - involved in drug abuse of a variety which slows down reactions and allows you to feel a minute as if it were a long time. The new drug called slo-mo is made in one of these towers.However, even in such a futuristic setting, there are the good guys known as the judges who prevent things from happening to good people out there. One such judge is Dredd. The fate of the criminal head ma-ma and Dredd gets intertwined when a crime happens in ma-ma's super sky scrapper and judge Dredd goes to investigate it. Amidst a lot of fire power, action, bloodshed and a new mutant rookie cop, Dredd fights crime and buys time till help arrives. The fight sequences are thought carefully and the mutant rookie cop adds in a bit extra to make the plot interesting. The catch is that these two cops have to use there wits to survive and serve justice in the sky scrapper on their own since ma-ma locks down the entire structure. Be prepared for some action sequences. Best is to watch the movie without any expectations and you would end up liking it like i did. I give it a 6 out of 10 for the above content.",Dredd
321,c-conley90,One of the most Overrated movies I have ever seen.,1,15 May 2014,"This movie is so cheap and shallow that it's not even funny. I found out the reason why this movie bombed so badly. It wasn't entertaining or even well made. It's main character is a horrible killing machine with no distinct character traits even. Cheap South African,(And I don't mean disrespect to South African made movies, District 9 is pretty good and well budgeted, as is Chappie) Cannon Like production of an Action movie reminded me of Superman IV nearly. Or one of those other 21st Century Comic Book movies like Captain America from 1990. Obviously the budget was only limited to a few sfx shots of the city that might as well be stolen from Blade Runner. Our hero is no hero, he's a thug and a killer with no sympathy or humanity. It's version of Dredd is Robocop without any of the humanity or background. We are forced to have to sympathize with his partner Anderson who is merely there for titillation and half hearted attempts at humanity. Other wise you get Lena Headey's bored acting, she learned nothing from being equally terrible on Game of Thrones. She reads lines with no energy and with no real characterization but hey evil. The script was written by an Academy Award Winning writer, could have fooled me. It seems written by a teenager in puberty who just learned the art of cussing and who maybe has anger management issues. Our bad guys are even more faceless than the ones in Assault on Precinct 13 and that movie is a freaking masterpiece.It's just so mind boggling how this movie gets praise. It seems more just a movie to rub people's faces in unpleasant violence and shallow, wannabe-cool dialogue. Maybe Garland thinks himself Tarantino. I know The Raid had violence in it, but even it wasn't as laughably bad as this movie. And it's characters didn't need to say shallow, wannabe cool dialogue. They didn't feel the need to dress like cos players taking a break from comic-con. People may think that Evans stole from the script of Dredd. Quite frankly I don't believe this. Evans took an old story device and used it as his own. Same as Dredd did, but The Raid actually made use of it and wasn't really reaching for all this grand, wannabe epic, cool BS. And our main characters in that weren't psychotic killers or thugs with Nazi regalia on. And please, Stallone did more with this material in 96 minutes than this movie could even dream of doing. The writers of the comics just need to get over the precious changes he made. So what about the Helmet. What was that helmet? Important? Not really, it's not like it wasn't featured in the movie. And to further the Robocop allusions, Robocop took off his mask during the last part of his movie to symbolize his humanity the same way Stallone does. Clearly this movie seems not to care about this symbolism. It's hero is a guy who has lost his humanity and shows few hints that we care not to know about in a sequel. In short, this movie is terrible, cheap looking, boring with long scenes of slowmo and drug inhaling. Violence and death is glorified even worse than most movies and I can usually stand some glorification of violence. Not Recommended.PS. Slowmo is one of the lamest drug excuses for doing fancy slow motion shots in your movie I have ever seen. It's stupid, why the heck did you need a drug in the movie to explain why scenes were in slow motion, writer? Just have slow motion in your movie, it doesn't need a drug to explain it being there, it just seems like a excuse for you to have it. And a lame plot device. You couldn't have come up with some special future drug that was like a mixture of heroin,ectasy crack, cocaine, weed or something? No, you had to create something that I'm surprised the actors and actresses could say with a straight face!",Dredd
322,Thomas-Giffin,Happy 2000AD Fan here.,8,11 September 2012,"I must start by getting my Judge Dredd fanboi out of the box so any future words are placed in a proper context. I am a HUGE fan of Judge Dredd, one of the most important and iconic British comic book characters. I have anthologies of his early progs from 2000AD as well as a quick 30 sketch of Judge Dredd by Frazer Irving in glass in my room.Big fan.Stallone's 1995 vehicle, Judge Dredd got some things spot on, despite it being critically destroyed upon release. It looks good, it has several integral elements such as the Cursed Earth wastelands and Stallone looks suitable as Judge Dredd himself. However, it does MANY more things wrong, the 'company' sidekick role provided by Rob Schneider is simply terrible. The villain, Dredd's brother is pretty poorly underwritten and the whole thing fails to satisfy in any way that the source material deserves. It's budget was $90 million.Enter 2012, and Karl Urban fills the famous helmet of Judge Dredd. Cut the budget in half to a reasonably cheap sum of $45 million and get Vantage Point director, Pete Travis to direct and Alex Garland (28 Days Later) to write the script and see what happens..F**king awesome is what happens!This Dredd is a tightly made, tightly scripted, claustrophobic film with a healthy dose of brutal violence and a wicked view as to what makes the comic work so well. For $45 million the director had to make the film enclosed and the production design is exquisite, the Peach Tress block is a marvel of near real highrise coupled with an impossible futuristic scale. Mega City One itself hardly plays a part, only on few occasions does Travis let the camera soak in the whole city, instead teasing us with closer shots which are indicative of the larger city at work. The colours, the framing, the sets are all created beautifully to give this horror of a futuristic life not too far removed from the future to be fantastic. The drug featured in the film 'Slo-mo' is obviously used as a means to get slow motion shots which play out so beautifully. I watched the film in 3D and these scenes are horrible in their violence and beautiful in their movements. The suddenly flooding of colours and the ethereal haze these sequences create is one of the best uses of 3D I've ever seen, take that James Cameron!Speaking of violence, the film does deserve its 18 rating. In fact, film fans, Dredd is the first 18 rated film to open number 1 at the UK box office since 2010 with over £1 million on its opening weekend alone. This is GREAT news because they have hinted at doing further Dredd films if the movie makes double its production costs, that's only $90 million worldwide folks!But yes, the violence. It is violent. Very violent. The violence in the film isn't directed with a voyeuristic approach, instead it is done in a much more matter of fact way. It is as if the violence on the screen, although horrible, is nothing special and that such violence happens in the world of Mega City One all of the time. It's really well played.But the BEST thing about the film and I'm so happy to say this, is Judge Dredd himself as a character. Karl Urban puts in a masterful performance without ego as a man who refuses to change his ways, refuses to compromise in the face of the law and also (crucially), doesn't grow as a character. He is not a person who gains an important lesson or whose character arc is the crux of the film. No, Judge Dredd starts the film as Judge Dredd and ends the film in the same way.It is left to the secondary character of Judge Anderson to give that character progression to the film. Played very well by Olivia Thirlby, Judge Anderson is the rookie cop assigned to Dredd for a performance review and goes through a trial by fire. However, her character is the 'interesting' one, growing, changing and learning as the film progresses. Lena Headey's Ma- Ma is simultaneously clever but terrifying, providing a worthy villain for Dredd's rampage. Add in dealers, vagrants and other Judges and you have a great series of characters for a film.At a well paced 95 minutes, the film is brisk but never dulls whilst also not skipping past details. The main plot starts quickly after a searing introduction to the world and Dredd himself. The rest of the film's pacing goes well, allowing you a slightly slower scene or two just before the unrelenting pace and tone becomes too much. To help counter this is a surprising sense of humour. It's black humour, for sure, mostly from Dredd himself, who's single word here and there regardless of the insanity of the situation is played up well.All in all, I am honestly glad to say that Dredd is a triumph of a film. Fast, well made, funny, violent, everything the much loved 2000AD deserves and that makes me so happy!",Dredd
323,alexdelliott,if you don't want a story but would prefer to see lots of people get shot then it may be worth a look.,2,13 September 2012,"STORY:What story? set in the future where cops (or judges) are permitted to carry out sentences on the spot (in most cases this sentence is death), this film is about one particular judge named Dredd. He and his rookie partner (who is a psychic) get trapped by a gang of drug dealers in a huge apartment tower block and have to fight their way through hordes of enemies. That's it, nothing else, basically Die Hard but not as cool and without any criminal mastermind played by Alan Rickman. The baddies seem to be so well connected that they can lock down an apartment block, bribe several judges, afford high tech military equipment such as mini-guns, and send hordes of people to kill just two judges. There is no realism which I understand isn't the point of this film but there really is no development either. I won't give any spoilers but by the end the characters have achieved nothing and learnt nothing, there are hints at character development which become nothing. People will try to convince me that i just didn't understand it or that I need to read the comics first. But believe me when I say that this is a bad film and the plot has no substance. As a somewhat amateur film critic I felt insulted that my friends actually insist I see it. 1/5EXECUTION:I have little to say about how this film was executed as there was not much that really stood out. The whole film was riddled with clichés from the main character's silent, moody action man character to the gang of swearing loud- mouthed idiots who would put real criminals to shame. Even the rookie was predictable as she gradually lost her innocence throughout the film. There was nothing particularly notable about the directing or the soundtrack apart from the slow-mo effects which were a fun idea but were used far too often and became tiresome quickly. The acting was as one would expect from a B-rated action film. One positive would be the 3D as the type of film really suited the extra effects. On the whole it was a poor idea with a poor story executed poorly. 1/5VERDICT:Need I explain? This really isn't a good film and I have trouble recommending it to anyone. But if you're a fan of ""One man army"" films like Die Hard and if you don't want a story but would prefer to see lots of people get shot then it may be worth a look. If you do see it it's certainly worth seeing in 3D. Sorry that this review was more of a rant but those familiar with my reviews know that I always try to be fair and unbiased by popular opinion which at the moment seems far too high for this film. 1/5 + 1/5 = 2/10",Dredd
324,Batsy1501,Great !,8,23 August 2021,"Much better than i expected ! Of course it was not perfect but i really like it ! The script was simple but good in its own way, just straight to the point and there was no lengthy scene in it.",Dredd
325,gundognc,I AM THE REVIEW! (I'm not but I couldn't resist...),8,9 September 2012,"""Dredd""/""Dredd 3D"" is not the Judge Dredd film that I'd like to have seen but it is an excellent attempt to bring the character back to the big screen (after the disastrous 1995 Stallone vehicle ""Judge Dredd""). It is a simple film in which the titular hero is pitted against merciless enemies in the controlled environment of a locked down super- skyscraper. The genius of the Judge Dredd stories was to make us empathise with Dredd himself and his zero tolerance approach to the law. I can only hope that ""Dredd"" is successful enough for a more nuanced film to be made, there are many superb Dredd stories to work from.PLOT OUTLINE Judge-cadet (and psychic) Cassandra Anderson and her evaluating officer Judge Dredd respond to the scene of a multiple murder in the Peach Trees city block of Mega-City One. They are sealed inside by a ruthless drug- dealing gangster who is determined that they should not escape alive.REVIEW Filmed on significantly less than half the budget of the previous movie, the filmmakers have been forced to create a different, and in many ways more credible, Mega-City One. In ""Dredd"" we see an enormous city dotted here and there with towering, kilometre tall, city blocks. Roads filled with conventional vehicles and everything overshadowed by the towering Hall of Justice with its just-not-quite-fascist eagle emblem. It is a convincing setting that successfully highlights the gritty dystopian nature of Mega-City One.This more practical approach extends to the costumes which take an intelligent approach to combining the iconic elements from the comics (the shield badge and eagle shoulder pad) into something that someone who isn't in a comic might actually wear. One small disappointment for me was the guns. The Judge's sidearms were highly convincing but the villains all appeared to be carrying what one would think would be prized antiques (assuming the time-line to be somewhere between 2070 and 2100). Karl Urban is excellent as Judge Dredd capturing his aggressive and humourless approach toward the rigid application of the law. He looks exactly as Dredd should and speaks his lines with total conviction. Olivia Thirlby as Anderson does a great job of injecting some humanity into the story and providing the audience with someone to identify with. The writer and director (and I suspect Ms Thirlby also) clearly understand that the best Judge Dredd stories are never *about* Dredd but about people who come into contact with him and the circumstances surrounding those events. Lena Hedley has little to do but what she does she does well. The special effects are good, the addition of the time slowing drug offers some good opportunities for slow-mo violence. Despite the ""3D"" tag on the film I'd love to have seen this in good old fashioned 2D as I found the 3D elements distracting and jarring. I will be buying Dredd on Bluray as soon as it comes out. The story is, as detailed above, extremely simple and the film is a series of what have no doubt be described as ""high-octane"" set-pieces with little or nothing else. As several others on IMDb have said, I eagerly await the sequel.NOTES It seems worth providing some information for people who may not be familiar with the character of Judge Joseph ""Joe"" Dredd. Created in the late 1970s for the newly created British weekly comic magazine 2000AD, Dredd is perhaps one of the best examples of a mis-aimed fandom in history. He was, it is said, intended to be a satirical comment on then popular fears of a political descent into fascism (it is worth nothing that ""V for Vendetta"" was written at around the same time). For anyone who is interested in reading a Judge Dredd comic, I recommend the stories ""America"" and ""The Pit"" (both available as self contained graphic novels).",Dredd
326,omahonyjason,DREDD 3D: if you like action movies; you'll love this!,8,19 September 2012,"Your reaction to this movie will depend entirely on where you stand in relation to action movies. If you like high octane movies with anti-heroes talking in gravelly tones; you'll love this movie. If you're a fan of DIE HARD (1988) and the recent THE RAID (2011); you'll love this movie. If you think SIN CITY (2005) rocked and JUDGE DREDD (1995) sucked; you'll love this movie. If you like blood and guts served up with a smattering of humor and cooler than all hell visuals; you'll love this movie. If you enjoy tightly scripted films that stay true to the source material yet are equally accessible to new fans; you'll love this movie. As a matter of fact, if you like action, then there's every chance you'll love this movie!The 2000 AD comic strip, Judge Dredd, and its eponymous character, which is the source for DREDD 3D, was created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra way back in 1977, which, in comic book terms, means it's just about as old as Methuselah. It also means that there's plenty of fans of the original comic book, fans who were bitterly disappointed by Sylvester Stallone's woefully poor JUDGE DREDD (1995).Those fans can relax. I'd bet my bottom dollar that Alex Garland, writer and producer of DREDD 3D is a big-time fan of the comic book and he has penned a movie that stays true to the original, while creating a film that in no way demands viewers are familiar with the comic strip.Garland penned 28 DAYS LATER (2002) and the novels THE BEACH and the far better THE TESSERACT, which were both turned into films with varying degrees of success. He hits all the right notes with DREDD 3D, it's the rarest of things; a comic book film that stays true to the original comic while simultaneously scaling new heights.For those unfamiliar with the comic strip, Judge Dredd is a judge in an America of the not too distant future. On the East Coast of the US, running from Boston to Washington DC, lies Mega City One, a vast, violent metropolis where criminals rule the chaotic streets. The only force of order lies with the urban cops, called ""Judges"", who possess the combined powers of judge, jury and instant executioner. Judge Dredd and his fellow Judges are empowered to arrest, sentence and even execute criminals on the spot. Known and feared throughout the city, Dredd is the ultimate Judge.For DREDD 3D, Dredd is asked to cast a watchful eye over a new recruit, Anderson, to see if she has the makings of a real Judge. Anderson has completed her training but has fallen just short of the grade, Dredd's superiors decide to give her another chance because of her psychic powers but want Dredd to make the final decision after a day of on-the-job training. He and Anderson go on a routine call and end up trapped in a battle with a gang led by Ma- Ma, a ruthless former prostitute and drug dealer, who sells SLO-MO, a new drug that allows users to experience reality at a fraction of its normal speed.So is it any good? Hell, yes it is!Keith Urban does the best gravelly voiced anti-hero since Clint Eastwood. DREDD 3D is a DIRTY HARRY (1971) of the future, while Olivia Thirlby puts in a star making performance as Anderson.Everything about this movie is class; the performances, the script, the action. Even the 3D is amazing. SLO-MO as a drug is a genius plot device, allowing the filmmakers to slow down reality so the viewers can experience 3D in all its depth defying brilliance, while also vicariously experiencing the effects of the drug addled characters.DREDD 3D is a character study fueled by violence and action and, as such, it won't change the world. It won't alter your political view. You won't be touched by its poignance or moved by its emotional core. But so what? Who cares? That's not what you go to action movies for. You go for balls-out confident action. You go for super-violent, well thought out set pieces. You go cos you wanna sit at the edge of your seat, gasping for breath. You go for bombastic thrills and for heroes that fight with a fury that is charmingly diabolical. DREDD 3D does all that and more! If you like action movies, you'll love this film!",Dredd

I've seen the 1995 Dredd, I love it but this was. . .modern day UGH. . .first of all the plot was so loose it could have been a bowel movement. And the MaMa Gang, oh come on.****SPOILER***** you mean to tell me that the dispatch calls in for assistance at the Peach Tree then Dredd and the rookie goes but the nerd behind the desk at the building also calls in a ""testing"" phase or something like so and they allow it to go through knowing or should have knowing that judges are already there on a homicide call? YEP that's make a lot of sense.then we see this supposed psychic who adds no real excitement to the movie except doing what psychics do and get inside ppl heads, however though, if she is such a psychic how come she didn't use her powers before going in to predict that, hmmp IDK, they would attempt to be massacred? And why did MaMa (such a stupid name) decide it was crucial to shut down a whole sector/building all so they wouldn't find out she ran some drug thing when she had cop friends on the inside who could have killed the guy she didn't want interrogated various times throughout his journey back to the holding cell or what have you? didn't MaMa blow up a whole sector of floors? Didn't look that way at the end, not to mention this testing phase they were in really made the cops ignore such a huge blast, in that neighborhood?? UGH so much that annoys me. . so much that is so wrong and so not worth the two stars I gave it which one was for Karl Urban and the other for sexy Olivia Thirlby.",Dredd
328,Forgotten_Conscience_Productions,Should you fear Dredd because he is in 3D?,7,8 September 2012,"You often hear the phrase thrown around in the industry that ""remakes are a dime a dozen in Hollywood these days"" and what a horrible and creatively bankrupt thing that is. But there's an obvious question goes along with that statement which doesn't really get asked all that often, and its ""Is that actually a bad thing?"" Anyone who reads my blog will know that I have gone on record in my dislike for this whole indie versus Hollywood divide which is thrown around in the film industry a lot. Often in the vein of a conversation that says independent is good, Hollywood is bad. I don't really understand that sentiment.Here we have a bit of a different situation though. We have a movie which in some cases is considered a remake of a film made not 15-20 years ago. A movie which I am old enough to have remembered the original release of the film I saw when it did. I can understand people's hesitation in going out to see the film. I went into the film with low expectations of what it might actually do because of the fact that I remember the first Judge Dredd movie starring Sylvester Stallone. There is a case to be made for remaking a film too soon. Much like a mourning process, it's a good idea to wait an appropriate amount of time before trying again. What that waiting period should be is open to interpretation. Personally I think that a minimum of 10 years is required to truly get a film out of someone's mind before taking it on. A person who is a big fan of an adapted work might disagree with that assessment, but like I said that's open for debate. However, suppose for example that something was done badly the first time. Should a shorter waiting period be implemented? Many of the fans of the Judge Dredd comic book weren't very big on the 1990s adaptation to a feature film. Do you listen to them and try again quickly or do you wait until someone who really understands the material comes along and adapts it properly? How does one even find such a person?In the case of Dredd 3D, I think they have found those people. Director Pete Travis and star Karl Urban clearly care about the material they are involved in and they worked together to make it what it is. During the Q&A, the writer said that this was one of the most collaborative projects he had ever worked on. Speaking from personal experience I know that sometimes that can be a drawback in a project, particularly in one where the makers have such strong feelings about the subject in question. But with the right kind of people and the right kind of vision, sometimes it can be a great thing.Dredd 3D is such a project in my opinion. There are people out there who have seen the Judge Dredd from the 90s and will automatically avoid it for fear of another dud. Unfortunately, those people are going to miss out on something that is absolutely worth seeing. Karl Urban's portrayal of the infamous Judge Dredd is worth the watch alone. Olivia Thirlby as Anderson and Lena Headey as the villain Ma-Ma manage to elevate Urban's performance even further if only because a man like Dredd is focused and driven, something that Urban does well, and he needs someone to play off of. Thirlby in particular adds the human element to the story without being a helpless victim for Dredd to constantly save. She can save herself if she has to, and trapped in a 200 floor tower full of criminals? I think it's safe to say that she has to.This kind of story marks a turn in the way people are being portrayed on screen. In some ways it's a return to the good guy versus bad guy storytelling that was common up until the tragic hero and the anti-hero became the popular way to tell a story in recent years, but with one major difference. We have moved beyond the ""hero rescues the girl"" or the ""helpless love interest"" female character that was also common of the pre-tragic hero story and we are looking to do something new with it. Dredd 3D is the beginning of what comes next, and personally, I am glad to see it. SoShould you fear Dredd because he is in 3D? Absolutely not, in fact I think you should cheer him on.You can read more of my reviews at:http://andrew-heard.blogspot.ca/",Dredd
329,poyrazbaklan,not bad...not bad at all,7,1 January 2013,"I remember when the first judge dredd movie came out, it was a big deal. It had stallone, diane lane AND armand assante, a cool storyline and action scenes and pretty good cgi. So when it bombed, people were quite surprised. I personally like that movie very much, it was an ambitious one. All in all, dredd was never this mainstream comic book character people idolized or even knew very much but the post-apocalyptic crime ridden city and the judges kind of impressed me, and mainly because I was ten years old at the time. Now when I heard that they were shooting a new one in 3D, I was not very impressed, Karl Urban, who I consider not built to be portraying action heroes(hear me, DOOM) was going to portray Dredd and it would have a more simplistic story. Then again, I was wrong. It turned out to be quite a nice movie. Sure it doesn't have the set action pieces of its predecessor or even a cool plot that makes you wonder what will happen next, but it is a fun watch. Instead of an over-arching plot that changes the foundations of the franchise, they instead opted for a smaller adventure, within dredd's life, as in a days work. It is a buddy cop movie, much like lethal weapon. Lena Headey is overacting but is admittedly impressive as the hooker-turned-gangboss and dredd is alright as the no-nonsense judge. The movie is chock-full of tie-ins and easter eggs towards the comic, including dredd's never taking his helmet of. Urban's ""I am the law"" is not as iconic as Stallone's laughably over the top impression but playing whole scenes with only your mouth showing is admirable. All in all it is a watch and forget movie, with scenes clearly shot to make use of 3D and slo-mo effects(if you run them on normal speed the movie would be like 50 minutes long)But it is still fun to watch, nevertheless. They could have made the world look a little more grim though, the outside shots look like your ordinary metropolis(it was shot in johannesburg, I read) and not some grim-distant future megacity.",Dredd
330,maue-19674,DREDD - I am the Law!,7,21 March 2020,"I didn't catch this film version of the famous 2000AD character until well after it's cinema release - which was a pity because I expected it to be pretty standard. What I actually got was a first-rate Action Film, no padding, 18 rated and brought with style to the screen. Karl Urban steps into the Judge's boots with bells on - his growling menace eats the scenery, which is what I saw the original Dredd to be like. The Story gives Dredd a 'rookie' to evaluate, only their day goes from bad to, well, HELL! Olivia Thirlby is excellent as Anderson, the mind-reading rookie who has to keep up in a very dangerous situation. Lena Headey's 'Ma Ma' is a credible antagonist and the set pieces are brilliantly done.
Ma Ma is dealing the new drug SLO MO, which allows for some fabulous cinematic visuals depicting how the world must seem through the eyes of people who have been taking the drug.
I found the film to be way better than I expected - entertaining, well acted and extremely well crafted. As for Urban's Dredd, I hope that we see a sequel - he IS the law!",Dredd
331,mrnomore,Dreddfull...,5,22 April 2013,"Let me begin by writing this; this film is a straight ripoff. ""The Raid: Redemption"" came out 2011 and was a punchy success with a fantastic new taste. Apparently too good to be left alone...So it's clear to me all the budget money went to special effects. The characters are weak, the story is a bad ripoff with big holes and missing valid points and there are no surprises whatsoever.It might be entertaining for some but as i already mentioned, it's nothing for those who watched ""The Raid: Redemption"".Shame, i was hoping for some crazy action and nasty twists. Maybe Dredd 2 will deliver better...",Dredd
332,Kelchubordnor,what Dredd should be,8,11 October 2012,"First thing, if you go by the comics you see a few connections such as obviously Anderson (PSI division) and Dredd not removing his helmet. This movie is quite simply superb I loved it. I will apologise however as I have not read 2000AD or Judge Dredd for many years but he never loses his appeal.Dredd as a character is superbly played by Carl Urban (hope I spelt that right) He is a clone of a Chief Justice if I recall as was his brother Rico (no mention of him in the movie that I recall). Dredd is simply told to take the rookie out on her first day for evaluation. Simple as that he pretty much decides if she passes or fails. If only life was that simple. He basically treats this as another day at the office so to speak. He rattles off the stats for Anderson in a very ""this is how it works deal with it how you want"" kind of way. I really enjoyed this aspect of the Dredd character, he's been there seen it done it got the t shirt.Effectively this is two Judges versus a 200 floor block controlled by a former prostitute called Ma Ma. Orders are to kill the Judges, simple as. Building is locked down and no communications at all (so no back up for Judges). The resulting movie is very violent and bloody as well as very close to the comics. The story is weakish but the acting makes up for it. Do enjoy this.",Dredd
333,kyla-72302,"Gory, but satisfying.",7,9 November 2021,"I closed my eyes for a lot of parts, but the story was good and the characters grew. The action, and the acting were all spot on.I thought the filmakers did a good job of humanizing the bystanders who get killed, which I think is really lacking in a lot of action movies.",Dredd
334,macub8,If you read 2000ad you will love this film,9,8 September 2012,"I have long been a fan of Judge Dredd from the comic books originating in 2000AD The makers have done a fantastic job of recreating his robot like character and thank-you for not removing the mask.Judge Dredd never once removed his helmet in the comics just part of his aura. Anderson is a great choice,Judge Dredd is not happy at first with a mutant as his rookie but you see a bond of respect form due to her professionalism and morals. She adds an emotional twist to proceedings. The plot is simple but flies along and the cgi while not too overbearing creates a scene of city life in the future. Good to see the ""lawgiver"" show its different range of ammunition and the judges bikes ""lawmakers""really are great but would have liked some scenes showing off how his bike is also like his partner to a degree in the back up it provides.it has its own persona.I hope we are going to see some more from this team It would be great to do a cursed earth sequel with the larger than life characters like the ""mean machine"" one of the angel brothers coming to mind adding to the mix.The big cgi sets would be great for an Imax Cinema Very happy with this film congratulations to all involved.",Dredd
335,marais-alexander,Watch for the visuals,7,20 September 2013,"This film was very entertaining in terms of Karl Urban keeping a completely straight face and a steady voice when saying some cheesy lines. One of my favorite scenes with him in the movie is when he and his rookie (Olivia Thirlby) are confronted by some kids with guns. But what really makes this movie actually worth a look is the visual imagery. The slo-mo scenes, needless to say, are beautiful and thrilling to watch. The film brilliantly turns gross-out gore into something you can't take your eyes off of. Even when the film isn't in slo-mo, the gore is enjoyable because of how excessive and stylized it is. Very, very artful stuff. A scene where a key character is thrown from a balcony on slo-mo has definitely, on a technical level, got to be one of the coolest scenes filmed since The Matrix. The little of the grit and grime of South Africa, where the film was shot, still in the film not replaced by CGI really suits the picture. It's not like I was blown off my feet thinking Dredd's world was real by any means, but it did help that the design was so elaborate. Overall the performances are solid. Karl is an excellent Dredd (I haven't seen the original, but heard a lot of bad things). Olivia is a good Cassandra Anderson. She's the most empathetic of any of the characters, and plays that well. She balances vulnerability and wide-eyed learning with a kick-butt, do-not-mess-with-me demeanor really well. There are some cool action scenes with her in them. Lena Headey is the highlight of the cast as Ma-Ma. She was great. Her performance out of everyone's was the most subtle, and the most disturbing. All in all Dredd is purely popcorn entertainment. And it's thoroughly fascinating visually.",Dredd
336,votesmall,One of the finest action films I have ever seen and possibly the only reboot that works,8,12 January 2014,"Not many action films get good reviews, much less a reboot. So, I am quite surprised that I liked this one. I also don't usually like comic book adaptations either, as they usually suck. Without further ordue, let's talk about Judge Dredd. Originally the main character of a British comic strip known as 2000 AD, which focused on a lone futuristic cop who has to try and restore order to a violent, vast metropolis known as Mega City One after nuclear fallout caused the rest of the world to become desert. It was dark, gritty and the kids loved it. So, naturally, there was talk to do a movie. A film remained in the works for a while until it was finally approved for production. That movie turned out to be Sylvester Stallone's Judge Dredd, one of the many films Stallone did in the 1990s when his career was in a slump. As you can imagine, the film was absolute garbage. One of the worst superhero movies ever made. There were a number of problems, such as the fact that it focused too much on the visuals rather than getting us introduced to the setting and its characters. It also had Rob Schneider, which kills any movie. Stallone also clearly didn't understand the character and he even admitted that the film was bad. Judge Dredd became a punchline in Hollywood. Nothing more. Even though the fans of the comic were disappointed that they hadn't got a film close to the comics. This dilemma was kind of like the original Batman serials compared with the darker 1989 Batman or The Dark Knight. Years went by with fans asking for another film closer to the source material but the studios saying no, unsure if the film would return a profit. Well, eventually after years of development, Dredd was greenlighted. Sadly, it lost money at the box office, as expected for years, but it was well-received and thought of by fans and Dredd's creator as a great adaptation of the character and his story. Essentially the film's premise is simplistic. The viewer is introduced to Mega City One, which has like, 800 million people and huge government housing projects called Mega Blocks, which basically contain entire cities worth of populations. One of these Mega Blocks, called Peach Trees, is taken over by this drug lord named Madeline Madrigal (Ma-Ma) who reveals a new drug known as Slo-Mo, which does just as the name suggests. Makes viewers perceive time much slower. Judge Dredd is called to investigate this gang killing in the Mega Block and he is also told to take the rookie Judge, Cassandra Anderson (who also has psychic abilities), in with him for evaluation. They arrest one of her enforcers named Kay and Ma-Ma orders the judges killed. The plot is so simple it is almost ridiculous. But Dredd works. The 1995 movie was too focused on the expanse of Mega City one and the Cursed Earth and didn't tell us anything about either. Even though Dredd almost entirely takes place in the 200-story Mega Block, it manages to tell us more about Mega City One and the people in it than the 1995 movie. But how was the film as a whole? I loved it. This is by far one of the grittiest action movies ever made and quite possibly the most gritty comic book movie. Whereas the first Dredd movie was trying to be more of a kid's film, Dredd is not. This one is purely for adults. It's ultraviolent, but the violence isn't exploitative, it's realistic. In this film, you see flares going into people's mouths, bullets penetrating through people's cheeks, heads explode, people being blown apart by miniguns, eyes gouged out, people skinned alive, arms get blown off, people are thrown off buildings and windpipes crushed. So, if blood bothers you, stay away from this film. But if you want a realistic and bleak action film, check this one out. The cast is superb. Karl Urban is the perfect Judge Dredd, and he proves a capable, believable actor for such a difficult part. Olivia Thirlby as Judge Anderson provides a relatable character that we can see an arc develop from. I thought that Lena Headey killed it as Ma-Ma, and I wish I could have seen more of her as the villain, perhaps with some more development also. The script is great, and although there are some pretty cheesy lines on paper, the actors are so great that they come off extremely badass and memorable. As for the effects, I normally don't love 3D effects, but I was surprised to see that they truly worked in this film. I have only seen two 3D movies that worked. Dredd and Gravity. Also, Dredd uses the slo-mo to a great advantage by making it look like a drug trip. The slo-mo scenes are truly great and only enhance the feel of the movie. I wish this film had won some Oscars, because even though it probably didn't fit the Academy's standards, this film deserved more exposure. Hopefully they make a sequel. This film is great. I would suggest that you give it a watch at the very least. Truly underrated.",Dredd
337,ernesto-garcia,A Genuine Review of Dredd,9,28 January 2013,"This Is the 2012 Remake of the 1995 film titled Judge Dredd.I must admit that I am highly impressed by this film.The Story evolves around 2 Judges one a pro, and one a rookie going on a routine drug bust in a large building occupied by the poor and the dangerous.Things spiral out of control from that point on,as the two judges face off against a deadly drug lord. The two judges must escape the building and defeat the drug lord.If I have one problem with this film is that the original Dredd was so bad that it wasn't very hard to best it, and to me at least the remake doesn't feel very special. See this movie if you like lots of action and a smart and witty writing, see this movie.If you hate action films or do not enjoy senseless violence then you might want to skip this one. 3.5/4",Dredd
338,kanenasanonas,Really wanted to like this but...,6,29 December 2012,"As my title states, this turned out to be an average movie. OK, its light-years better that the Sylvester Stallone cr*ppy version, but still not satisfying. The good news: Carl Urban was a good choice for our favorite judge.Olivia Thilby is IMHO gorgeous, not actually fit for the role of Anderson but still manages her role well. It is in general, highly believable The dark ""feel"" of the comic is greatly preserved The drug Slo-mo provides a nice touch.The bad news: Shares too many similarities with ""Serbuan maut"" (aka the Raid Redemption) without any of the incredible action sequences Serbuan maut had. Tremendously claustrophobic, you don't get to see anything (at least Sly took a trip to the cursed earth, even space in his version). And as stated, no action sequences to counteract to that loss.Most peripheral actors, especially the ""other"" judges are far below average in every aspect (speech, action sequences and believability). Especially the single female of the judge quartet (who was that anyway?) should not get another job in Hollywood It could serve as a 36min episode if J.Dredd was a TV series, but we expected something more. Surely this film will satisfy die-hard Dredd fans, but for all others, does not provide more than 6 stars of entertainment",Dredd
339,mrda1981,Ain't no Pity in Mega-City!,9,20 January 2013,"This adaptation of the popular Brit comic strip, whilst not quite as grim, claustrophobic, and constricted in setting as its source material, is nevertheless much, MUCH more faithful to it in spirit and detail than the accidentally hilarious 90s Stallone vehicle.The action set pieces are pleasingly brutal and visceral, with some good, plot-relevant use of slo(w)-mo, but it's the three leads that really shine. Karl Urban plays Dredd stonefaced and curt, capturing the essence of the iconic character (even with his movie-softened edges); Olivia Thirlby portrays telepathic rookie (and popular spin-off character) Judge Anderson with an idealism and empathy which makes the viewer hope she survives her first day on the force; and Lena Heady portrays main villain(ess) Ma-Ma with a cold, predatory world-weariness, making her presence felt formidably.Inevitably, comparisons will be made to The Raid, the Indonesian flick which shares a similar set-up (law officers storming a tower block run by crims) and release time; however, Dredd has enough elements to differentiate it from said flick, its characters and setting being somewhat more distinguished than its (nevertheless esteem-worthy) present-day-set counterpart. The strong world-building that forms the backbone of Dredd leaves open the possibility of future explorations. I'll be interested to see if (and how) Travis integrates characters like Judge Death and the Cursed Earth mutants into his universe, or explores the authoritarian implications of the Judge System via sequels. As things stand, this is THE adaptation of the dystopian comic strip and a brilliant action movie in its own right. My only regret is that I didn't see it in cinematic 3D, what with it being lauded as one of the few flicks to use the gimmick in an integral and effective fashion.",Dredd
340,firstruleofmethclub,A far superior reboot that will probably never see the sequel it deserves,8,17 April 2015,"I really was quite a fan of Dredd, I thought the actors, post-staff, director, writers and cinematographer all did an outstanding job. However, there is one man in the crew who makes the rest look bad. By comparison. Because Paul Leonard-Morgan's soundtrack is by leaps and bounds the standout piece of what was already a decent film by its own right. His work on Dredd is praise enough (he also did spectacular thing's for Limitless in 2011). I never got into the deeper Judge Dredd universe (ie. 2000 AD comics) and almost all of my knowledge comes from cursory internet searches, and that ""Dredd VS Death"" video game. But from what I can gather, Dredd is a more honest depiction of the source material than the Stallone-led Judge Dredd of '95. So the music is outstanding, the Slow-Mo scenes are innovative and spectacularly produced and the specialised ammunition are astounding to watch. These are the three best parts of the film, in descending order, which to be fair, means that the gimmicks of Dredd are its most impressive feature. It's story is not broad (More of a ""day in the life"" than ""save the human race"" deal) and its characters are not greatly explored (though certainly not shallow), and it's mostly held together by these aforementioned ""gimmicks"", but more power to them! Better to have a solid baseline interconnected with deeply original fascination, than to have a boring rehashed piece of crap baseline, loosely stapled together with some poor excuse for dumping the same cliché $100,000 CGI explosions we've already seen four hundred times this quarter. Surprisingly, New Zealender Karl Urban (Star Trek, Star Trek: Into Darkness, LotR trilogy) makes for a better Dredd than I'd anticipated. Having a psychic was something I was initially skeptical of, too, however Olivia Thrilby (Juno, The Darkest Hour) put my concerns to rest after a long enough period to buy her role (about 25 minutes). And Lena Headey (Sarah Connor Chronicles, The Purge, Game of Thrones) I've liked since she played Queen Gorgo from 300 nearly a decade ago, so she""s always a safe bet in my books, particularly in the role of relentless drug-lord Ma-Ma, she really is at home playing ruthless women of power, isn't she? That all said, Dredd is not the best film I've ever seen. It's not even the best action-focused science-fiction film released in 2012 I've ever seen. But it takes risks, and that's nothing to be scoffed at. We need more Dredd's in our film industries, something to break up the monotony of most of Hollywood. Something that doesn't need to go big, or tick x amount of acceptability boxes, it's satisfied just being good. 77%-Gimly",Dredd

I'll bullet-point the rest in a minute; the most beautiful of the lot is that it does not patronise YOU.It's an honest and brilliant adaptation of the 2000AD character and the brutal near-future world he inhabits.However, YOU do not need to be a fanboy. YOU do not need to be versed in the narrative of Mega-city One.WE are almost there - the opening vista of the terrible futuristic sprawl and the soulless characters running wild within it will resonate with everyone.35 years ago Dredd was science-fiction, set in 2020. Today, chillingly, Dredd seems the natural progression of justice and society.Enough grimness. Back to the beauty: * - the 3D. Incredible use of what I previously considered at best a gimmick, at worst an unnecessary irritant. Its deployment is breathtaking and integrates seamlessly with the action.* - the timing of the action (indeed the length of the film entire): Never too long, never monotonous, always carrying an edge and brimming with tension. Superbly implemented, edited and produced.* - Dredd and Anderson/Urban and Thrilby: they absolutely nailed their characters. Urban's Dredd IS Judge Dredd; a fine line between Neitzsche's ubermensch and dystopian fascism embodied. Yet he is ultimately human here, too; and also something else - hinted at by Anderson in the opening scenes. And Thrilby looks so much like the vulnerable, but deadly beauty Judge Anderson I remember from the original artwork it's as if she was designed for the part.35 years ago a disgruntled, bored kid was bought the second edition of 2000AD magazine because there was a free 'space spinner' frisbee on the front.The first episode of Judge Dredd was inside, lurking, waiting to captivate and enthrall with its bewildering anti-hero. Often, the reader was transported through realms of science fiction beyond the dystopian grandeur of earthly mega-cities - across space, into the horror of inter-dimensional entities, parallel universes; Dredd's world expanded to encompass mind-expanding ideas and adventures.They channelled it all via this unyielding, monolithic, mysterious character. Therein lay the irony; Not for them the gaudy, please-all whackos of Marvel/DC comics.Dredd is everyman. Dredd is superman. This film is the perfect introduction.NOTE: Robocop referers - Dredd came FIRST. Robocop was Verhoven's take on Dredd. Robocop's character, his lines - all sourced from the Dredd character of 2000AD. Get it right. The Beatles did not borrow from Justin Beiber....NOTE: The soundtrack; clublike, adrenalin-manipulating.

It wouldn't surprise me, that the sole reason why it didn't make its budget back at the box office, was the 1995 cheese-fest ""Judge Dredd"" starring Sylvester Stallone. This remake is miles ahead of his predecessor and more reminiscent of the early ""Die Hard""-movies.Dredd has the feel of an outstanding 80s- and 90s-action-flick, which happen to have been made in 2013. The story is simple, the characters don't have real depth to them, but the ride is so much fun that you really don't care. Dredd is fast-paced, violent and doesn't cut or turn the camera when a character dies on screen.Although some scenes stick out as ""made for 3D"", they didn't bother my 2D-viewing-experience at all, but rather tempt me to revisit the movie in 3D - which never happened to me before.

345,j-tochtenhagen,"Maybe true to the original, but feels like a computer game",4,27 April 2013,"Yes, indeed, Dredd never puts his helmet off during the complete movie. This version of the comic stays more true to the original, it's colder, completely humorless and unemotional.The plot is extremely thin and feels and looks like one level of a computer game. The characters are pretty much simple with out any depth.Overall this movie is OK, but it never keeps up to the Stallone version, which features much more depth, excellent characters and a good story too. The Stallone version is much more epic and keeps a very good balance, whereas this version lacks almost everything which is needed to be a classic.Obviously the cold and dark style of the comic is not suitable for just being copied to film, and that is why the Stallone version is much better.In the end Judge Dredd 1995 will stay more memorable than this version.",Dredd
346,zaywhat,I like it. I like it a lot.,8,4 September 2014,"The original was a cartoon with human actors. I like it too.The remake is gritty and Lena Headey brings the chops to a character so evil yet competent and strong enough to rule a small world of people.The remake surpassed the original in the complexity of a protégé on the battlefield and yielded the central character in the same, intentionally shallow depth. The city concept, rendering and cgi machine gun devastation were technically superior and relevant. The image of the youth on an exterior service platform was excellent. Hillen Mirren in Reds and Lena Headey in Dredd 2013 both stick in my mind now. What is it about a woman with a high caliber machine gun?",Dredd
347,limoncella-641-42235,Judgment Time,8,7 September 2012,"In 1995 when Judge Dredd starring Sylvester Stallone in the title role hit theatres; critics derided it, audiences dismissed it as ""dumb"" and it failed to achieve commercial success. Even though this film has gained a cult following, it just wasn't the Judge Dredd movie fans wanted. Now a low key British film company has had another crack at bringing Dredd to the silver screen, and the result is a great science fiction action film that holds no punches and gives the audience a gritty, gory and surprisingly relatable take on the comic book hero.Karl Urban plays the titular ""Dredd"", not the most recognisable or bankable actor working, but certainly one of the most versatile. He has a far better hold on the role than Stallone did, Stallone gave a performance that was robotic and almost comical. Stallone would growl and maintain an immovable fanaticism to upholding the law, strutting about in his ostentatious costume. There was very little humanity to the character and it was difficult to relate to him, he was basically playing Robocop.Urban brings more humanity into it, when innocent bystanders get caught in the mayhem he's sombre and vengeful. He treats upholding the law more as a burden, he would rather issue a life sentence than gun a criminal down. Only when the odds are stacked against him and he has to defend himself against armed goons does he act violently. Urban gets as much out this character as possible with half his face covered up. It's not just an improvement on Stallone's take on the character it's an expansion of the comic book character too.The supporting cast are all excellent, and they all give great performances and have strong characters to work with. Olivia Thirlby as rookie judge Anderson deserves praise, playing a character with psychic powers is not easy, her approach on the role makes you believe everything her character can do. She is not a weak female role either she is never once the damsel in distress and there is no attempt and sexualisation. Lena Headey as the villain Ma-Ma steals every scene she's in, a crazy blood crazed woman who almost seems to enjoy going toe-to-toe with someone as lethal as Judge Dredd. She doesn't care who gets in the way she just loves the thrill of it all. An insane villain who is ready to just about pull anything is captivating and intense to watch, i really wish she had been in the film more.The Megacity in this movie is not the Blade-Runner-Esque city seen in the 1995 film, it resembles a modern day overpopulated inner city slum. This gritty realism is one of the films biggest strengths. Dredd himself is not a superhero, he gets shot and bleeds like everyone else this feeling of vulnerability makes it easier to relate to the character.There's no Rob Schneider in this movie, oh no, no desperate comedy at all there's just no laughs to be had whatsoever. This film is gritty to the extreme, people are seen being shot to ribbons, blown up, set alight, crushed, splattered, skinned, tortured etc etc etc. Yet it never feel over exploitative, just the right amount. It's just how this stuff would happen in real life, once again coming back to the films visceral reality.The film is not without its flaws, coming off the heels of The Raid a similar film in premise about law enforcers scaling a tower block to get someone at the top floor makes one draw comparisons watching it. The Raid had amazing martial arts to make up for its slower parts and was consistently upping itself while being as gritty as it could be. Dredd doesn't have anywhere near the impressive stunts featured in The Raid and it makes you wish you had seen The Raid after you saw this, because you keep thinking to yourself: ""this scene was done better in The Raid"".The slow-motion sections showcasing the effects of the ""Slow-Mo Drug"" are a little overused, the colour is over-saturated and these are the only times in the film where the 3D is used to a noticeable degree.Overall it's a far superior Judge Dredd film to the one that came before it, and has enough action and doesn't over-complicate itself to the point where people aren't bored watching it. It takes a comic book that has been tagged as notoriously impossible to adapt, give it a gritty and realistic setting and cast some great actors to give the movie some life. I hope there is a sequel because it would be really great to see more of this version of Dredd, Urban has a better grip on what the character should be and i can see him taking it a long way.",Dredd
348,Caesarboy5,Very Solid Action Movie,8,29 November 2014,"Dredd is a modern day action movie DONE RIGHT. The characters develop, the plot is intriguing, the concept and the world come to life beautifully, and most important of all: quality (the execution of the entire affair) is emphasized over quantity (the run time). This film is short and sweet.THE GOODThe acting is great. The dude playing Dredd is a perfect Dredd: he's rough and efficient. The woman who plays his partner does a great job at conveying a newbie who's able to learn quickly in order to survive. Lena Headey also plays an awesome villain. The script is great. I never read the comics, but from what people tell me about them, the movie has captured the spirit of the comics (although it did miss some stuff, which I will go on about later).The use of special effects is notable. The slow motion effects (when the enemy characters are doing a drug that slows down time) is beautiful and actually makes sense. There's a scene where an enemy guns down a huge amount of living areas with a heavy duty machine gun, which makes a crap-load of explosions occur. While you might be shaking your head going ""how the heck did they survive that?"" , the movie is good enough to let that one slide. This movie has some kick-a$$ action set-pieces, and they work because you care about the characters involved in them.THE BADThe movie, apparently, missed some opportunities to raise some cool moral questions that the comics, apparently, did. While I'm no expert, I do know that some more moral dilemmas would have benefited the movie if done correctly. Either way, Dredd at least dipped it's toes into moral ambiguity, which is more than what most action movies can say.There's also some moments where you're gonna be like ""How the heck did they survive that?"" but you'll ultimately like the heroes enough to let that one slide. A healthy dosage of ""disbelief suspension"" can never hurt, either.VERDICT:This movie is what the generic action movie SHOULD BE. It's short, and it's perfect in what it set out to do. It's a very enjoyable movie, and I recommend it to anyone looking for a well-executed action movie with likable characters. On the other hand, it isn't anything groundbreaking or spectacular, in the sense that it hasn't broke any boundaries in film. It's just a very good movie, and that's why it gets an8.5 / 10",Dredd
349,joelsmith190,Dredd is NOT Robocop,9,29 January 2015,"It's dark, grim, gritty, and action-packed.Unlike Stallone's garbage film that had nothing to do with Judge Dredd, and tried WAY too hard to make him Robocop (a fine character, but these two are on opposite sides of the spectrum, character-wise) this one was simplistic, and you honestly feel like the character was done justice. Take a hint from this movie, Zack Snyder, this is how you do a character justice without copypasting from the source.One fault of this film, however, is that it overuses slow-motion. I heard that it was good in 3-D, but if you watch this on home video, you'll want to fast forward through those scenes.Dredd and the rookie are stuck in the megablock, and must work their way through waves of mobsters and try to call in backup.This movie is so simple,, it's a breath of fresh air.And it's full of action.One could argue it's a bit too gritty, but it's better than the original where no blood was in at all (or if there was, it was like a scratch).And Karl Urban actually knows the character and doesn't have Stallone's ego, and was fine with not having his face shown.It's a movie I can recommend to any comic book fans that want to see a great character done justice, but also want to see some mega badassery.So as much as I want to give this a perfect score, the film is a tad too gritty and overuses slow-motion. And that drops it down some pegs. Definitely a film to watch if you want to see some bodies drop and some dark humored punchlines. The movie nails Dredd as a character as I said before.I can't wait until they do a sequel to this thing.",Dredd
350,johnsim,Should have been a 15.,8,4 March 2013,"An 18 rating for this film confuses me. It might be because I watched the Blu Ray rather than in the cinema, but I'm still scratching my head wondering why it had an 18 rating. However, I digress.Not having been an avid reader of the comics I'll skip over the whole helmet question. Rather I'll say that Karl Urban has once again put in a superb performance. With films based upon comic books / graphic novels you're never sure what you're going to get. This film doesn't go for the comic style but rather a much grittier environment and is the better for it too. Karl plays Dredd with that grittiness and as you watch the film you get sucked in by his performance.New to me was Olivia Thirlby, who played a trainee who has been given to Dredd to assess. As the film progresses she evolves her portrayal of Judge Anderson through not one but several subtle and sometimes more obvious characteristics. In the end you can not imagine any other actress playing this part.But I leave final comment for the few scenes where the film must have blatantly used 3D. Obviously watching in 2D I've missed something, but then shouldn't a well directed film be enhanced by 3D rather than defined by it? Perhaps by not watching in 3D I've missed the point here, and perhaps one day I'll purchase a 3D TV.Overall a thoroughly enjoyable film but leaves small question over the 3D use and more importantly why it was given such a strict 18 rating.",Dredd
351,DavidTL,Dredd Done Well,8,9 September 2012,"Plot was very simple, but good and is exactly what you think it would be from seeing the trailer. What also made the plot cooler is that it seemed like an 'every-day' scenario for them, and even at the end it is referred to as a drug bust gone wrong, just like its a normal thing. The special effects and slow-motion scenes to show characters on drugs were pretty good and the 3D was actually good, but mostly in the slow-motion scenes. It is probably the best movie I've seen that uses slow-motion, unlike King Kong where it wasn't really necessary and especially the last Resident Evil which I'm sure the new one will too. The acting was pretty good and not as cheesy as you think it might be from the trailer. The violence is extremely graphic but well done. Some of it is even like ""wow, did they just do that?"". It is a fun film that doesn't take itself too seriously and is re-watchable. I was hoping though however that the death of the villain Mama would have gone on more with a sort of fight scene, and we then see she isn't as tough as she thinks she is against Dredd. When she was falling in slow motion though, the shot where we see the ground floor I was hoping to see her body splatter all over the floor just for some guilty pleasure. The budget for the film, which was $45 million just seems like 'wow', as it does seem bigger budgeted. If Hollywood can continue making $45 million movies instead of $150 to 200+ then they would save a lot of money. 8/10",Dredd
352,starlimitz2,"Cold-rolled, Raw Dredd",9,13 May 2014,"A very entertaining action flick. Dredd does a very good job in depicting a futuristic city that, while a baron wasteland, it doesn't over-exaggerate how terrible things are. Yes, there was a lot of chaos on the streets, but you can also get a glimpse of what the normal city life was like, and after that, the movie was very easy to relate to. Then things got darker. Lena Headey does a little too well as this movie's antagonist, her performance actually makes you believe she castrated a man to gain power over all of his turf and money. The actual weakness I saw in this movie was Karl Urban. Not that it's anything to do with his acting or his costume (though I did like the original movie's Judge Uniform better) it was more in his presence, he didn't seem to command the same fear or authority that Stallone did when he starred as Dredd in the 90's. Then there's the violent scenes. Graphic, yes, but that's not the problem. The problem was the over-use of computer animated blood, and when it was on the screen, those scenes were slowed down more often than not, and it really just looked sloppy. This is a good example of why practical can beat computer Generated in many, many cases. Still, other than those minor details, the movie kept my interest from beginning to end.",Dredd
353,malcydon,Pure Awesome!,10,15 January 2016,"Everything that an adult excellent film needs is in there! 1, Excitement 2, Darkness 3, Psycho 4, Simplicity 5, Mood 6, Gore1, You are excited for every turn, every new part. Minutes after minutes you just sit there and wow! What is coming up next? Did that guy just died? Wow! Is that.. that, and that is that? It's awesome. The movie keeps you entertained through it's whole length. The dialogues are needed and good, the fightings are also needed, good, and exciting. 2, Darkness. I don't mean that the movie is pitch dark and you can't see just black pixels. The movie tells about the typical things you know - family/living in ghetto, prostitution, human cruelty - and doesn't force it on you. Just shows it. It's just there and thats how the movie operates. It goes beside it, like: Yes, thats a hobbo. 3, Psycho. I mean this in many things. The crazy thoughts, maddening life, the reason and so much more. It makes you think about dark things as a secondary/extended line in the bits/parts when there are no fightings in the moment. It gives you dark viewpoints and feels like a game where you have to choose something on a dialogue tree. This is also just there, not forced. Just lurks here and there. 4, Simplicity. Very important for me. Nowadays they are trying to fool blind you with complicated story lines, either because of plot holes or because they are trying to make the story better, but it's just too much. Here, it's not like that. The story is simple. Complicated, yet simple. No needless twist and such. A simple linear objective, with lesser adds, events and happenings. It's not forced. Something happens and the world reacts, while they try to fulfill their objective. 5, Mood. The mood is the best thing in the whole movie! ..and I don't mean it badly. Every other part of it is awesome, but the mood shines through of it all! The details are good and grim, just like the whole atmosphere of the movie. The buildings are how they should be, the people, the street, the stress on people, the talks. Everything is at it's own well-deserved place. The lights are well done, the camera view is good - not frustrating, not idioticly placed -, the telling and progress is excellent. The people are unique, not just meat bags and they actually show personality even for that 0.6 second for which they live. 6, Gore. This in an action movie. Shoots happen, people die. When someone dies, each death is unique. They get shot, they get a hole somewhere, from which blood comes. People don't just fly around, no stupid fights. Guy is there, lives-> get shot, and dies. The hole is little at the in, and big at the out. Blood is on the ground and walls, realistic and not overwhelming. When you see someone bleed, you know they will die in two minutes.This movie is awesome. Totally worth it.",Dredd
354,robbieclaravall,Dredd is tough and unflinching.,7,21 May 2017,"The future America is an irradiated waste land. In this violent world, police have the authority to act as judge, jury, and executioner. Dredd, a well-known judge, teams up with a trainee to take down a gang that deals with the smuggling of narcotics, ""Slo-Mo"". Dredd is best with its violence. It's brutal, unflinching, and occasionally badass. There is a lot of it, but not exceedingly gratuitous because it truly is the nature of story. The stunts are done decently as well. All of these are complimented by the performances, which in any way aren't outstanding, but enough to be extremely entertaining. Karl Urban is intimidating with a hard-assed, business commercial voice to play someone like Judge Dredd, and Olivia Thirlby has strong spirit and willpower to play Dredd's rookie, Anderson. Lena Headey, the antagonist, is very menacing and thrilling, though it would've been better to see more layers to her character than just the film exhibiting her in a tonally black format, killing people just for sport.The thing with this film, in spite of the well-done violence, is that it feels lazy with its world. It takes place mostly in the compound where they're trapped in, but the futuristic world they live in doesn't feel fully realized. There are explanations here and there, but there's no continuity and connection. They're all loose threads; it takes place in a futuristic America, it's post apocalyptic, it's cyberpunk, but these threads aren't really tied to one another to evoke a great sci-fi setting. The buildings do look great, accompanied by a techno soundtrack (think Refn's Drive) and gorgeous visuals, but for a film with an interesting world, it doesn't fully explore the potentials of its bleak future. Dredd is tough, chaotic, and really brutal. The violence is handled well, the gun shooting and close combats designed and performed with expertise. The visuals are great, the city shots and ""Slo-Mo"" sequences gorgeously looking as well as the electronic score, but for a science fiction thriller movie, the undeveloped futuristic world was quite disappointing to see. Nevertheless, it's still worth a look in spite of the setting and the lukewarm antagonist.",Dredd
355,hopla68,a modern action masterpiece,10,27 January 2013,"for at least the last 2 years, probably longer but with seeing so many crap movies your memory tends to fade a bit, I saw virtually nothing on the screen that got hold my attention, made me feel engaged and - like the good old action films could when we were little- more alive somehow.I remember myself cheering and shadowboxing the screen with Rocky 4 when I was 15 or so, that feeling.There were some highlights, the expendables 1 which floated on nostalgia, guilty pleasures like resident evil but thats about it.The came Dredd. I saw the one with Stallone and it was well.. in those times a movie with Stallone and you went to the cinema.. nothing special.I can honestly say that Dredd is a movie which has about everything right and the sum of the parts makes it even stronger.. Karl Urban is Dredd, he breathes and lives the part, the action is over the top and the music is topnotch. But what this movie makes for me ( and this is the main reason I compared"" The Raid"" to a porn movie..the same again and again,and never a pop shot) this movie is one long pop shot ;everything leads to an almost primal experience. Basically if you are a guy and you have some testosterone somewhere you will feel it if you watch this movie. And yes its a guy ( and/or a tough chick) movie, and sure its pure popcorn but it works.And how many movies can actually make that statement, that you are not googling some guy in spandex with CGI, or robots with CGI or whatever crap - yes twilight series, I am looking at you! - is thrown at you? Not that many..almost none. Thats why its a disgrace that this labor of love ( read in some background of this movie) produced by an independent studio got wasted at the box office. that this great film got its chances blown for a decent sequel and is basically condemned to straight to video hell if there is a sequel somewhere. This is a disgrace and a shame and it says a lot about the current type of viewers that flock the theaters. I can only say to director, actors and writers, thanks guys and girls for having the balls to do something different and to give us - and at least one grumpy viewer from the Netherlands- a chance to see your vision of Dredd.

Although this does help speed the pace along very well. Karl Urban is excellent especially for only showing his mouth and I thought Olivia Thirlby was excellent in her role. Out of that though, their isn't much substance in the story and would like to see a sequel with a more fleshed out world and characters but it was a fun time and what more would you ask on a Saturday night.Rating: B Comment: Doesn't carry much substance in the story but does pace itself well",Dredd

Over the top violence and gore...and the characters and people are so cold or blasé about. Like its normal. To me that's what's it about with the Judge Dredd Universe.And i can't IMO give it a bigger compliment than comparing it to Batman Begins. The difference between Dredd 3D and Stallones Dredd is just as big or even bigger than Nolans Batman and Clooney's Batman.The 3d effects are great and fits the movie perfectly. It was used as a tool to engross you in the movie and enhances the whole feel of the movie. It was all worked out well and it was a long time since I enjoyed 3D so much.When the movie ended...I just couldn't wait for the next installment and hope it will just be as good.To be honest I don't know who is key to this movie. I don't know anyone(director,writers or producers) involved really besides Urban. So hope the team that made this stay together for the next movies.Urban was perfect as Dredd BTW. Oscar worthy. He was so in character.Totally believable. A machine...matter of fact he was more machinelike than Robocop's Murphy. He didn't for one moment deviate from this character.

361,imagineda,Bad day at the office,9,8 February 2013,"""Dredd"" takes place in real time, over the course of a particularly nasty day at the office for a certain law enforcement officer, and his psychic rookie. The whole film takes place within a huge tower block, which has been locked down by the bad guys in an attempt to trap and eliminate Dredd & Co. This, of course, sets the scene for a barrage of very violent action, as Judge shows the bad guys who's boss, and his protégé gets some, uh, on the job experience.This film just works. It's well cast, with Karl Urban mastering the deadpan Dredd delivery, Olivia Thirlby providing a great counterpoint as the psychic, sensitive rookie Anderson (who thankfully isn't wearing a helmet), and Lena Headey getting all dark and nihilistic as gang leader ""Mama"".The confined setting and simple plot actually enhance the action, as we are kept more or less in real time, where the tension is constant and the stakes are high. It's a slow burner .. I usually abhor pointless violence and mindless action, but the gritty visuals and serious (but not too serious) tone are so faithful to the comic series, it really elevates this film above the usual mindless pulp. You could almost step thru the film and see the frames of a comic book unfold.We get to see Dredd and Anderson's relationship develop, as Dredd is tested, Anderson grows in confidence, and Mama slowly implodes. Interestingly though, without Anderson's rookie character, I think Dredd would probably have been a failure. Thirlby is not only a rose among some pretty ugly thorns, but her innocent character kind of grounds a lot of the senseless violence in the film, and her actions at the end speak volumes.Also the few 'slowmo' drug sequences offer a dreamlike change of pace, and are really well shot.",Dredd

The story sees super cop Judge Dredd stuck in a tower block fighting a drugs gang on each floor. Dredd must get to the top floor and fight ''Ma-Ma'', female gang leader who used to be a prostitute, but is now a psychopath willing to kill anybody in the name of business. The future looks bright.The story isn't really important, we expect criminals to be killed, and that's what we get, in a blitz of furious action that features numerous heads exploding and people being skinned alive. Not a film for the family, unless you have a brave warrior family. Pretty much the only thing that sets this apart from every other action film made in the last 20 years is the use of slow-motion effects to painfully detail the brutal deaths of characters in a weirdly artistic way. However, the film lacked any sort of tension, our ''hero'' Dredd had no human qualities, I found myself not actually caring if he defeated the gang or not, and the ending lacked any sort of suspense or originality. Overall, despite the film being the first film in a while that actually earned its 18 rating, it was a disappointing attempt at a remake, I would just go and watch The Raid instead.5/10",Dredd
363,johndavidson-1,Simple and brutal : Dredd is credible but lacks the satirical edge,6,8 September 2012,"First off let me say that I enjoyed this movie as a mid-budget cop/action movie that just happened to be science fiction and just happened to be focused on Judge Dredd (the long running star of British Science Fiction Comic anthology 2000 AD).Also, Karl Urban brings the character to life with only his voice, his posture and his chin available to convey emotion. Olivia Thirlby is equally credible as his psychic sidekick rookie judge Anderson.With a modest running time (95 minutes) and a plot that ticks over at a fair, but not frantic, pace there is little time spent on world building. We are told that Megacity one is a brutal city cut off from a barren post apocalyptic wasteland and that people live in vast Mega Bocks of 75,000 inhabitants but the scale and potential for claustrophobia are barely mentioned far less exploited for plot or atmospheric purposes. OK, so crime is rife and the police are overstretched, but that's hardly new.Design-wise the mega city looks like something out of The Wire or Distict -13 rather than the Minority Report, Blade Runner, The Fifth Element or even the recent Total Recall and this is disappointing. That said there are some nice touches - with references to Chopper & Kenny Who? sneaked in to the graffiti. The story is simple enough as Dredd and Anderson attempt an arrest, before getting caught up in a lengthy game of cat and mouse with Lena Heady's bad-ass gangster Ma-ma. The action is hard edged with some extremely violent gun damage sequences (think Robocop / Saving Private Ryan) but the story misses the most defining quality of Judge Dredd. Over its many years a strong element of social satire has underpinned, counterpointed and just plain made the character work. This version lacks that and consequently lacks the beating heart that could have elevated it above a merely adequate R-rated cops under siege movie.Lastly, the 3D. Beyond a couple of slo-mo scenes this adds nothing to the film. If they'd spent the cash on more ambitious design/world dressing (or indeed almost any aspect) I believe the film would have been improved.",Dredd
364,vicarious_tool,"A movie with a huge loophole, but decent fun nonetheless.",7,22 September 2012,"Its a routine dystopian sci-fi action flick, with not much sci-fi and more concrete action. It's not altogether run of the mill and they try to delve a little into the psyche of the protagonists, but perhaps more will follow in the possible sequel(s). What sets it apart though is the effects(both audio and visual) and cinematography. Plenty of very-slow-motion sequences, where you get to see how intricate and beautiful simple droplets of falling water could turn out to be. That said, there is gaping hole in the plot, since if one takes a narcotic that makes everything around him/her slow (i.e. increases the frequency of the brain's processes) other people will appear slow and sluggish to him/her not the other way round. The person who takes the drug would be like the superhero 'Flash' (if his body also speeds up along wit his brain) for the normal person. During the film however they screw this up often making the ones who have taken the drug look sluggish, when it suits the action sequences(which would mean that the Judges are the ones actually on the drugs!).",Dredd
365,s_imdb-623,Great film but Dredd could have been more menacing,7,8 April 2016,"Love Dredd comic and this was a good portrayal, especially of Anderson. Liked the film. Liked the way things were translated into the real world from the comic but still managed to keep the look & story of the comic. Only criticism is Dredd was not menacing enough for me. In the comic no ordinary citizen wanted to draw the attention of a judge. Dredd particularly. He is basically a Dirty Harry robot. In this portrayal the robot part was good but he could have been harder - not the acting but the portrayal. For example the scene with perp holding hostage - some clever pauses or slo-mo showing emotions on faces & terror of realisation by the perp would have been good.",Dredd
366,Joel-942-144075,Judge Dredd's Son in another city,7,22 December 2012,"For those that read the comic series, neither this nor the 1995 version is a perfect fit. For those who just know the movie, then this is NOT Judge Dredd.This is not the same city, and it's not a convincing repeat of the same character, Judge Dredd.This would have been a GREAT sequel to the 1995 movie if they would have just done 2 things:1) Display the city in the same way as the 1995 city: futuristic buildings and traffic. There was no reason to present a different look, and actually instead of looking 'futuristic' it looked like any run down city with modern traffic (low-budget?). Also, since the bulk of the movie is within the mega apartment block - the change in city-scape was not even a needed 'artistic interpretation'.2) Dredd introduced as 'the son of' would have allowed for any oddities between the two actors, Stallone and Urban. They try to pass him off tho, as the same man, but he comes off as another excellent Judge (possibly of the Dredd clan) but NOT 'THE' Judge Dredd.Final Note: This does seem to be the American version of ""Raid Redemption"", but despite that (and my objections), it was a good movie.",Dredd

And this is one of the best that I've ever seen. It's not perfect, but have many things that good movies have. Good lines, good scenes, style, tension, good effects. It's a pit that the movie doesn't payback in box office because all the involved are very talent people. And courageous too, because it has high rated scenes, but always very stylized. It gives you a impression that the director and writers are very compromised to make a good movie, not only a commercial one. If you give a chance, get involved, this is a ride!",Dredd

The plot was nearly non-existent and it was too bad the director never followed through with the foreshadowing of Dredd's psyche. It was a tiny promise of something more, but never delivered.Once they got locked in the building you knew they would have to get out alive, so it was just a matter of how many bullets and how much blood sputter.The gratuitous violence, the blood, the guts... Is there really any wonder why there is so much violence in our world? Really, what a shame.I expected a lot more from Karl and was sadly disappointed.",Dredd
369,funeralfortheliving,Producers see success of Raid and throw in Dred to make a quick buck.,1,20 March 2014,"Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy! I'm sick of Hollywood making remakes for one people in other countries are not gutless yuppies and thats all Hollywood knows how to produce is gutless yuppie films with unisex lesbian men trying to play tough guys. What happened to all the real men in Hollywood? This script is obviously written by someone who has never seen a real gun, never been in a real fight, never read a single issue of Judge Dred, and who doesn't understand the basic rules of action film making. Rule number 1 the good guy has to be evenly matched even out done by the main antagonist. Dred grabs the skinny tweaker (girl) and throws her over the balcony, does that sound like an even match or a climactic ending to you? Hahaha, this dred is such a wimp his match is a girl? And the henchmen in this movie, if you thought a skinny tweaked out woman with the body of a little boy was weak just wait till you see the burger king window men who fear her and follow her orders. If you see the movie the Raid, that Dred shamelessly rips, you will notice that the bad guys are bad ass, the main character could not defeat most of them alone and he is a bad ass. Also the raid has breath taking martial arts that are break through and realistic, Dred has tons of cgi bullets and gore that make you go, is this a damn cartoon? This movie has two things going for it. One the violence which only is extreme to wussywood film goers who have tired of watching the main characters literally do all but put on a dress and higher an urban cowboy prostitute to finish their transition into woman hood, and two, slow motion photography used as a gimmick like in music videos only existing to fluff up the garbage. So it doesn't have much.Dred himself has no emotions, no humanity, oh lol, I've read people on here claim other wise due to Dred stunning two teen boys, after 4 or five scenes of Dred stating he was low on ammo of coarse but with all the bullets flying who's following the story. There is no back story to Dred in fact I'm betting they tossed Dred in just to keep the rights to making crap movies of him. This crap didn't have a story I got an hour into it before I figured out their was no script this crap was thrown together to make a quick buck off of comic book fame. I was about to turn dred off but I figured I'd see if the ending made up for the beginning and wow they stole the twist right off The Raid although I have to hand it to dred when the crooked cops sell out it is so meaningless, expected, and contrived its almost avant guard.This movie is a total failure but highly recommended to halo and black oops fans because if you can stare at cartoonish fake battle scenes for 12 hours straight one and a half hours of dred might not be so bad. Thats the only reason I think this is rated so high because video gamers are used to watching fake cgi crap all day but for those of us who have real lives in the real world you'll be saying what the hell did I rent Avatar 2? I'm sick of cgi, cgi breaks the fourth wall and it draws attention to the fact that you are watching a movie but no one critics it because wussywood tells you to worship the cartoon. Wusswood could put out stick figures tell you its state of the art and you'll be ready to defend it to your death. Just like they sold you on digital being better even though analogue picks up more sound and film more visuals than even the human brain. If film is progressing how come movies made 20 years ago look more realistic than the cgi trash today? If digital sound is so great why do your old albums transferred from analogue say sound quality lost? The only thing that has progressed it seems is propaganda and today people will buy anything sold to them, not just buy the product but buy into the sales pitch and repeat it like a mantra.Dred is a great example of the decline of our civilization. People watch TV like an animal staring at a fish tank. Your supposed to read film not just stare at it? Once you figure that out you won't be rating movies high based on the amount of motion on the screen but for the content within it. I'll take staring at a fish tank over Dred any day.",Dredd
370,huwbutts,"Overlooked, underrated and very bloody.",9,30 December 2012,"I was never an avid reader of the comics (as my parents would never have let me read them as a kid, and rightly so), I just happened to pick up a couple of my mate's back in the 90s. I remember being pretty taken with Judge Dredd's style at the time, and after watching the film, going from my dodgy memory, this has the style down to a tee. It's like one of those 1980s, futuristic, dystopian flicks, but done very, very well; it's dark, gory and fits a lot into 90 minutes.Urban has the look and attitude down that Stallone just didn't have, while the gruff voice is bang on, but occasionally drifts a bit too high. Thirlby was flawless; she is a terrific actress (and gorgeous). I think Headey was the weak link unfortunately - she just seemed to lack the menace the antagonist should have. The film is very-well paced (especially for a movie that takes place in a small area), even though the action sequences are a tad brief at points. The CG is mostly stellar, especially in slowmo sequences.I was so sad to hear that this didn't do well in the box office, but then I don't remember being bowled over by the trailer at all. If this had been marketed a little better, I think it would have made a huge difference. After having seen so many movies being overrated this year, it's disappointing to see something that is above-par go relatively unnoticed.Go buy.",Dredd
371,MTZink,SENTENCE: Unexpectedly Superior Entertainment,9,13 March 2021,"First: CONGRATS and SALUTE to Karl Urban for the outstanding performance in full Dredd helmet; lots of actors (yo, Pedro P) who don't have the style, substance and self-confidence to own the role and not need to make sure their faces are seen as much as possible. Not necessary for this story OR Urban's ego.
The camp Stallone flim hooked on a lot of unfair weight from the start. Not that the earlier one was THAT bad but did not make me expect much else overall. Remake of that? Yeah, ok. One day if bored. Not worried or caring about exact comic book adaptations as it looks like the basics were covered. (My fav Judge Dredd appearances were in graphic novels, one of which I think he was forced to team up with Lobo!). At any rate, yeah, yeah... shoot 'em up in future garb. Was casually aware of the movie's existence; not attractive enough for rental but hey... now on Amazon. To be honest I didn't clue into Karl Urban in lead until then. That would have made a diff, I admit.
At any rate: well freak'n done. Exactly what I'd expect and NOT expect. Ain't a romance or musical... future shoot 'em up, of course ... gritty city... gritty minions ... but sets IMMEDIATELY to business and never looks back. Carried off with a superior competency that raises it above expectations, blows away the earlier one and is a concise, no-wasted yammer length.
Thoroughly enjoyed. Laughed several times. Worth it just for the silent ""final disposition"" you might say of antagonist's lieutenant halfway through. Brutal effects at times but all in context. Well done.",Dredd

The script, performances and direction are all first rate. Karl Urban is excellent as Dredd to the extent that Sylvester Stallone's campy buffoonish take on the character is forgotten. Lena Headey is typically excellent as MAma and Olivia Thirlby is both vulnerable and tough as rookie Anderson.I'm delighted that I own this bluray and I hope that we get a chance for a sequel.

No likable characters. No one to care about. When the heroes were in danger or even being hurt, couldn't care less. No enjoyable or crafty action sequences. Senseless shootings & killings of EVERYONE. Everyone is a criminal accept like three people. Video game gore. It was just incredibly dumb and poorly executed. They spent more time on the graphics when people were 'trippin' than anything else. There was no attempts at acting from Karl Urban who was by far the most talented person in the cast. It was obvious he was directed to perform as he did. The costume design was surprisingly lame. The whole thing...Lame...",Dredd
376,ArArArchStanton,"Have 2 Beers and Check It Out. If You Take It Seriously, See a Dr. Immediately",5,28 January 2013,"First things first. Not bad. For what it is.It's a shootemup, just as advertised, and to the positive it does well in the first half of making you care about the 2 main characters. Anderson is cool, and I left wishing that I knew more about her. The same with Dredd. Anderson specifically had some great development, first tentative, then regretful in killing, and then realizing the necessity of it all and becoming confident in her decision making. Dredd forcing her to make the decisions was a conceptual touch which was excellently handled.I recommend having at least 2 drinks as I did while watching, as it is one of those films that begs for you to experience it in such a way. Pot might actually help if you are so persuaded.The violence is pretty well handled, especially the skinning at the beginning and the flaming head of the opening scene. I loved the guy smashing into the windshield also.I also enjoyed the setup for how they got trapped in this damn building. Mama didn't just trap judges, as Dredd later explains she would have gladly let them go. She did it so that the man they took prisoner wouldn't spill the beans on her operations and honestly the sequence of events leading to this decision was nicely done.After that, there isn't a whole lot else to be said to the positive.It degenerates in the second half as though they were trying to finish the movie off as fast as they could without thinking about it.The most egregious example is mamas death. The most undramatic death I've ever seen for a bad guy/girl. I almost thought I was watching My Little Pony for a moment as she floated in a cloud of colored sparkles for what seemed like forever before disappearing in the least violent way possible given a head first landing from a kilometer up. Didn't I deserve a better payoff? And what was up with the heart rate bomb? Way to plant that seed 2 seconds before it was used, and then have it not really matter at all. I guess they were trying to look for more of a purpose to simply throwing her off the building when that was the only logical and obvious thing to do from the beginning. So in order to act as though there were more to it and that they were thinking outside the box (which they weren't) they ham fisted this heart rate bomb into the fall when it would have been the same scene whether it was there or not. Did Dredd need that as a reason to throw her off? I guess so.Anyway the whole firing gatling guns across the corridor scene along with the evil Judge scene were just kind of extraneous. He gets out of the way of course and then fights off the evil good guys naturally. The funny part was that the evil good guy had him dead to rights, but instead of just shooting him he basically invites him to drinks and I don't know what the hell he was thinking was going to happen but he gets his ass kicked for being an idiot.The second most egregious example of racing to the end is having the build up to a big Anderson vs. Female Judge moment which lasts 4 seconds and doesn't matter. No payoff to that. A complete waste.All in all the evil Judges showed up just to fill in time.And somebody remind me how Dredd survived a bullet that left a 4 inch diameter hole in a concrete wall? I was sure that was a dream sequence, but nope. He survived a kidney shot from a cannon. Very impressive.Then of course the big battle with Mama's henchman is completely missing. Dredd and Anderson kill the last few people as though they were peons before Mama reveals what is supposed to be her big suspenseful wrist band bomb, and the film ends.It's OK. A good watch if you're drunk or high. If you're a big fan it's as much as could be possibly hoped for, meaning that it's really a cliché' future film without out any real inspiring concept to speak of, but done as good as possible. I do think it's better than Blade Runner however, although that film did have a more interesting concept. Dredd is simply better handled and I wish the two could be married.One funny note. My wife immediately said Robocop when she saw me watching it. And we all know how crap that series was.But films like Dark City did far more at building suspense and intensity. And that film did far more at building a world as well. Mega City one is only half interesting, as the movie left no clue why this city really existed or what had happened, or if the characters knew or didn't. It would have been more interesting to know that they didn't know why the world was the way it was than the film just not caring whether they did or not.So all in all, thinking back on people saying they saw this 3 and 4 and 5 times in theater, I have no idea why. It's a fun mindless watch once film. That would be understandable. Why you would see this again I have no idea.I give it a 5/10. Maybe a 6 if I'm being generous.And now you know that I have been fair, and that this is the truth of what this film is.",Dredd
377,rudimir-bombardinovic,Good Old Action Movie,8,4 December 2018,"In dystopic future hit by nuclear disaster on the edge of social disorder, judiciary system is held together by judges, the only force for order who act as judge, jury and executioner.Judge Dredd is assigned as supervisor to rookie Anderson, a powerful psychic who marginally failed the aptitude tests to become a Judge but, is given one more chance as she can be a valuable asset for Judge Order in future. Their visit to notorious slum tower block called Peach Trees turns into bloody mission for survival as they get in the way of Ma-ma, gang lord and main dealer of new powerful drug...Director Peter Travis wastes no time and in 15 minutes introduces us to main characters, plot and atmosphere. It is a violent world where life is worth nothing and survivors are those who are lucky or rough, and in most cases both at the same time. Action and Dredd's coolness packed with his one liners leads him up the slum to Ma-ma, with packs of bodies behind.In couple of moments film tries to touch ethical dilemmas of simplified justice judges use to efficiently punish offenders, as well as world in which people are turned into piece of meat system needs to deal with, but does not go into much depth. According to its setting, same is applied in aesthetic with explicit violent scenes of combat or death.Karl Urban is convincing and never goes over the edge trying to over show what he can do, as Stallone did in 1995 adaptation. Effort he put in physical training as well, as micro expressions, are nice touch to the role as it is to see Dredd moving like a pro and not waving his gun like gang member. Urban put his heart in his role and showed that hard work works, even if as an actor you don't have half of your face to show. Thirbly is solid as rookie that tries to pull herself together but gets shocked by real world outside combat simulator.There are things that could have been better. Some gang members look like they've just gone out of ""want to be gangster"" fashion saloon - tattoo, dirty talk, Kalashnikov, but at the same time seem so naive they cannot wait to be fooled by Dredd, or simply try to catch the bullet. Also, especially at beginning, it seems that Dredd and Anderson are taking too many bad guys with their smart gun that it makes you wonder what they would do without it. Luckily, as they progress there are couple of action scenes that show why Dredd is No 1 judge in town. Character of Ma-ma is puzzling but as narrative progresses does not go much into depth of her motivation. It is shame as this makes her convincing, but not one of the greatest villains we've seen.Mentioned above are common headaches most action movies of this type have and will not spoil your enjoyment if you are fan of action films, since Dredd does everything he promises - good action, believable characters, avoids most clichés and has good atmosphere.As I watched Dredd couple days ago, it came to my surprise that's third time I've seen it. It's that kind of film you will not see twice in a row but after a while it will be your pick after you been through all action classic, as a fond memory that does not fade as time goes by. I guess Dredd is that kind of movie they don't make anymore. And will not anytime soon as Dredd world wide's earnings managed to barely cover budget expenses. Shame, as Dredd is excellent adaptation that is praised by fans and is appreciated by everybody else. And rightly so.",Dredd
378,ryokan_wc,Pumped after the lock-down...,8,6 October 2012,"To be honest, when the movie began, the first thought that came into my mind was 'why am i watching this movie?' and i feared it would be like Spirit (2008) or Jonah Hex (2010). It was choppy and messy in terms of the filming, and the soundtrack was just not comfortable to sit through and watch in the earlier scenes. Then i thought whether i had wasted my money, and time, on this movie. Even the narrative at the beginning reminded me of Megamind (2010), which was good in the animation movie, but not quite convincing for this action, dark movie. I breathed, trying to calm myself down and be patient. Then, fortunately, the plot thickened and the direction of this movie turned away from my disappointment; drew me into the locked down Peach Trees building and went into high gear.In this time of setting, in Mega City One, the 'Judge' is known to its people with combined powers of the judge, jury and executioner. Dredd is one of those Judges- and possibly the top of the league, and is faced with a task to coach rookie Anderson, who has psychic abilities. On this fateful first day, the pair is led into the Peach Trees, replying to a call of the death of three men. Their investigation, duty to uphold the law, drives them to discovering drug lord Ma-Ma, who controls this 200 storey building. Not wanting to be held by the law, Ma-Ma (somehow, i felt this villain lack depth and did not really create fear like other villains in other movies; she was just a ruthless leader) devices a vicious plan to outdo the Judges- by locking them in, with no way out and no one in. This was the point that i really got to the edge of my seat.Despite its violence, the scene of the machine gun-laser-like shooting was brilliant, and the graphic was like for a game. There was not as many shootings as i had expected- sometimes, less means more. In another scene of the mind reading challenge reminded me of Jean Grey and Prof X, but in a more gruesome and vulgar manner. It was smart to have someone with psychic ability in the movie. An issue that were brought into the movie was corruption- not so original but it helped to move the movie to the next level.The movie developed to a peak-high level and i felt the climax was shorter than what i anticipated for. Nevertheless, i was pleased at the end of the movie.I could see why this movie is rated 18. First, the violence and blood can make you flinch. Then, there are scenes involving the influence of drugs called Slo-Mo, showing people who take them get high and the world around them sparkle, literally. Because it was 18, and because of these, i cannot but include them as points, not deductions, to the movie. The people behind this movie were bold and brave enough to include them.Speaking in terms of originality, i found the combined powers of judge, jury and executioner a breath of fresh air (i was not familiar with this comic), and the scenes involving the Judges to pronounce their sentence to the defendant were, in an odd way, entertaining. Don't expect drama or intelligent twists, this movie is not for either. It has a story to tell, a simple one but told effectively, with sufficient violence to keep adrenaline high and pumping.Dredd is a guilty pleasure as charged.",Dredd
379,deletewindowson,"Yes, It Hooks My Inner Fascist Alright!",10,5 January 2013,"Wow! Talk about nasty! This flick really impressed me. It reminds me of the original Terminator.. not in concept but in it's ability to reach out and hook my interest. Of course there are a zillion things wrong with it but personally I don't care because it pushed the right buttons. In the first place, Dredd looks like Dredd. And acts like Dredd. Way back when someone interviewed the creator of the Dredd character and he pointed out that Dredd is NOT a hero. In fact, he's a villain. He's an evil nasty fascist bastard altogether. That was the idea behind the character. The maker was satirizing the mean-spirited bloody-mindedness of Britain in the seventies. I don't doubt that it's much worse now, post-911/711 etc. London is literally a spy camera on every corner and a corrupt layer of cynical opportunists manipulating the security state to their own advantage. In Freudian terms, Dredd is Superego run amok! (Look it up.) The idea being evil times produce evil environments which produce evil responses. Dredd is what the ""good"" fascist Batman would be in real life, stripped of all his humanistic pretenses and reduced to the sadistic rigidity of the superego. A costumed goon. But as entertainment? A guilty pleasure for sure.",Dredd
380,drewconnor,awesome,10,6 January 2014,"Easily one of the best sci-fi/action films I've ever seen, definitely the best in a while. Not having read any of the comics, I didn't really have any expectations of the film; I'd only heard about the previous Sylvester Stallone version which was meant to be a complete failure. So like many other viewers I wasn't expecting to be amazed, but definitely was. I've now gone on to read a couple of the comics and can confidently say that there couldn't be a better introduction to the world of Dredd.It's impossible not to be captivated by the gritty, dystopian reality of Mega City 1. Reminiscent of the setting of Blade Runner or 5th Element, it's a harsh, uncompromising world troubled by overpopulation and crime. The seemingly futile quest of bringing order to this world is taken on by the Judges, a police force with the power to sentence and execute criminals. The film focuses on two of them: Dredd, a seasoned Judge, and Anderson, a rookie on assessment. Their mission is to investigate a homicide in Peach Trees, one of the roughest Megablocks in the city, run by the ex-prostitute drug lord Ma-Ma. Impossibly outnumbered but armed with high-tech weapons and Anderson's psychic abilities, they wander through the maze-like, seemingly endless expanse of Peach Trees. In spite of all they violence they inflict and encounter, the overall effect is dreamlike and almost hypnotic, an effect of the excellent soundtrack and captivating special effects which illustrate the effect of the drug Slo-Mo distributed by Ma-Ma's gang.I was impressed by Karl Urban's acting, not limited at all by having to keep his face covered by Dredd's helmet. Olivia Thirlby makes Anderson thoroughly sympathetic and worth rooting for as the idealistic but surprisingly resilient rookie.

The premise of the film focuses on Judge Dredd being accompanied to a potential crime scene my a newbie with a special ability(I'll say no more). I expected that this crime scene would only be part of the movie and that we would see a lot more of what Dredd and this newbie had to offer. Well I was wrong, the whole film focuses on this one crime, and is essentially stuck in one building the WHOLE MOVIE. This is what ruined it for me, I like to see many different settings.

He is, as he is fond of stating, the law. The time is the future, and amidst the wasteland that is America there is a single, massive city with 800 million inhabitants, appropriately called Mega City One. It's quite the scumhole, and the only thing that stands between it and total chaos are the Judges, trained for years to be the ultimate in law enforcement, yet so outnumbered they can only handle 6% of the crimes committed. This, people, is as thin as the blue line gets.The film is written by long time fan Alex Garland (28 Days later, Sunshine), and has had plenty of input from Dredd's creator (and still main writer even now) John Wagner. Filmed in South Africa on what passes for a tight budget these days (especially for Sci-Fi), it could be compared to District 9 in terms of the sheer effort put into it, with a result that is similarly impressive although aesthetically miles apart. Director Pete Travis (Endgame) does an excellent job, and between them they have turned in a film that will stand the test of time as a superior, adult action movie.The premise is reasonably simple, something that works well as an introduction to what is, in the comics at least, a sprawling future world. Dredd is accompanied on patrol by rookie Judge Anderson, very well played by Olivia Thirlby, who is on the verge of failing her final assessment but is being given a second chance because of her powerful, and rare, psi abilities. A routine triple homicide (it's that sort of city) turns into a siege when they are trapped in a massive tower block by criminal nutjob Ma Ma (Lena Headey) and forced to fight their way out and stop her manufacturing the addictive new drug, Slo Mo. Obviously there's a bit more to it than that, but this is the basic set up and it works very well indeed, allowing for plenty of violence, some character development and no few explosions.I can't write this review without focusing on Karl Urban, who has previously stood out for his excellent turn as Dr McCoy in the Star Trek revival. Not afraid to go through an entire movie with a helmet on, he is spot on as Dredd. He gives us an emotionless machine, a man who cares for nothing but the law, but a man you want to get behind and cheer on as he splats bad guys left right and centre. The humanity comes from Anderson, and it helps that Thirlby doesn't have to wear a helmet herself, with the handy excuse that it interferes with her psi abilities. Between them they give us the tired old wardog and the 21 year old rookie on the streets for the first time, and you sympathise with the life of a Mega City Judge.Some people have criticized the apparent similarities between Dredd and the recent film The Raid: Redemption, in which Indonesian cops storm a tower block and much chop sockey ensues. To be honest, I was a little worried myself, but having seen both films I can happily confirm that they are nothing alike. Whilst The Raid is a pretty intense martial arts film which is rather dull between fights (although the fights are awesome), Dredd is a tight film all the way through, with the plot more than an excuse to go from fight to fight.In conclusion, I can heartily recommend this film, in case you hadn't guessed. It's sort of like a cross between Robocop and Die Hard, all moderned up and with better music. It's no coincidence that those are two of the most kick ass action films ever, and Dredd borrows from the best, although as Robocop stole from Dredd in the first place it's more like recovering pinched property. The 3D is actually worth shelling out for, and there are some beautiful sequences where it comes into it's own, whilst the film itself is gritty and dirty, although not without a few lighter moments amidst the carnage. The humour in Dredd's comic strips comes from the city around him rather than his own actions, and here's hoping we'll see Alex Garland penning a sequel that allows us to wander through Dredd's world. Quite simply a superior action film, and whilst it's no masterpiece (then again, it's not supposed to be) it's as good as fans could ever have hoped. Here's to the sequels",Dredd
390,utkarshonly,Watchable movie,5,21 April 2013,"The movie has great action. Very rudimentary story and kinda clichéd with lots of loose ends. Story wise this movie sucked, good guy judges very bad gang types.The acting was nice and action commendable. I loved Karl Urban as the judge. The cold demeanor with an internal turmoil and ruthlessness. It was AWESOME!Olivia Thirlby did a good job. It was fun watching her. But, if you expect the movie to be a superb remake or so, you are going to be disappointed. It was more of an action movie than a sci-fi one.Well, the end recommendation is go for it if you are bored. It's a mildly entertaining movie.",Dredd

That is the worst fear ever God forbid the police get to become judge and jury, but I digress. It was a lot of violence a lot of guns, guts and blood. I wasn't impressed with this movie it seemed pointless and just a vehicle for gratuitous violence and special effects to justify 3D. I was not impressed I was not entertained I was bored and paid this movie half my attention. If you want to watch a movie that is more like a mindless video game then this is the movie for you.

392,alisoncolegrooveq,"The definitive Dredd movie, perfectly written and cast, and gorgeous looking to boot",9,16 October 2012,"As a 2000ad reader of 30 years, there can be no question whatsoever that for a relatively low budget film, this is a creative, visually spectacular and utterly faithful rendering of the original future lawman Judge Dredd.It's a shame that we've endured successful but utterly derivative variations including Verhoven's Robocop (which shamelessly directly stole from the design of Dredd) to wait for this, but we get a nicely taut simple 'rookie induction' narrative.Writer Garland (who clearly saved this film by taking control of the edit over director Travis) and Urban obviously understand the gritty humor and ultraviolence of the world of Dredd, but even more standout is the superb art design.Each frame feels like a comic composition and yet never distractingly so.The use of 3D is also commendable, used extremely creatively in the ultra slow motion sequences and thankfully left flat where gimmicky use of dimension serves zero purpose for action or narrative.The action is also nicely played out and I would argue superior to The Raid which began shooting AFTER Dredd...The Raid tends to go into absurd and gimmicky stunts and wears in the final climax...in Dredd, it's smart and purposeful.The Dredd universe is enormous and has literally thousands of great cultural narratives and humor.. but that requires HIGH budget for a Mega City full of robots, plastic surgery monsters, obese people on wheels, flying machines etc... This film puts a first step in the right place where Stallones was a bumbling but fun watering down for the uninitiated.Go see it, rent it, buy it...",Dredd
393,mightymothra,Immensely satisfying action film.,10,16 August 2015,"Holy hell did I love this movie. I obviously was not expecting much, since it's based on the Judge Dredd concept and every iteration of that comic has been awful. Not so with Dredd. It's first and foremost a kickass action flick with absolutely brutal violence and thrilling set pieces.The world of the movie is used perfectly, as background flavoring to one day in the life of a neo-fascist future cop with the impossible job of keeping order in a ludicrously vast megacity. There's no end- of-the-world plot he has to foil, no acknowledgment from the world for what he does, it's just one day on the job. Karl Urban plays the role without ever taking off his helmet, projecting himself as the ""embodiment of the law"" as he kills every single person between him and his objective. I liked how ugly and morally black characters on both sides of this crime war were projected - Dredd certainly needs to be monstrous to combat the unwinnable crime war, but his justice is personal and often vindictive. Again, it's a really satisfying vengeful thrill as the viewer, but I just liked how they didn't pretend like his violence was noble or pained.I can't think of many complaints. There's a brief mind-rape scene halfway through I really could've done without, so, be warned. Beyond that, it's just a great flick.",Dredd
394,DreddMancunian,What movie is everyone else watching?,2,26 January 2013,"I fail to understand the complete and utter adoration of this movie by everyone. Did I see a different film? I love Judge Dredd the comic. Mega-City 1 with its wild crazies and fashions, the Judges' bikes, the Lawgivers with their six different types of bullet, the Cursed Earth, the muties, fatties, futsies, skyboarders... even Walter the Wobot. None of them are here. The film doesn't even feel like sci-fi. It feels more like a ridiculously hyper-violent and f-word filled gangsta movie. Even Dredd's famous chin is missing! Casting admittedly was always going to be difficult. But Lena Headey's restrained performance doesn't come across as vicious gang-leader Ma-Ma. And Karl Urban is just too quiet. But worse, Dredd himself has no character. He's largely just a robot walking through the movie shooting at people. All the charm (and satirical wit) of the comic is missing. The films just lacks imagination. Walking through a tower block shooting at things gets old very quickly, folks. Despite the praise for the cinematography, all I saw was a few slow-motion shots that rapidly got boring. Never did I think a movie about Judge Dredd would be this DULL! Bring back Stallone is what I say!",Dredd
395,UtopianUK,Incredibly cheap and worthless,1,3 August 2013,"Looking like a made-for-TV Syfy channel movie, Dredd has terribly poor production values. I had to laugh at how Dredd looked like someone doing cosplay as he walked around an old shopping mall, with the public looking like a bunch of modern-day people paid to stand around.I understand that the producers opted for a ""gritty realism"" style that is popular these days, but that is no excuse for making the movie look like it was shot by amateurs with no idea about how to create ambiance. At times, it felt like the sort of thing college students armed with a good video camera would make for YouTube.This movie has no redeeming features; it's extremely poor in all areas.1(awful)is my rating.",Dredd
396,premium90,Better than you think! Better than the trailer!,7,9 September 2012,"Speaking to a lot of people and obviously, the difficulty of if or should I watched this film. I am glad I did. I have to say, the advertisement has not done this film any justice. First thing first, the '18' certificate is one clue that this film is what it should be. Although it may have limited it's audience, it keeps the film in the correct genre.This film is way better than total recall, although the main actor never takes off his helmet.This film is action packed from the start and to the end. I only had the option to see this film in 3d and the 3d feel of things is just about right. Not too much and not too little.I don't want to right a review based on what this film is about. This film attract people who like the comic book and people who like hard action films.This film is a filmed in the genre of die hard, robocop etc. I think you might understand what I mean. Just only one problem with the film is that there is around 10 minutes of boredom in it. The director somehow dropped the tempo a bit in the film and hence, the 7 out of 10.Also, from the word of the other half, this is a boy's film. Worth watching and not as bad as people think.",Dredd

Acting is wooden, Scenery is lame. honestly this is bad, okay it might follow the comic book and probably does a fair replica but honestly it is so contrived. Everything works out just the way they want, by accident they end up in just the right building, dealing with just the right crime I turned it off 30 mins - there is some lame plot about a gang in a tower block, something to do with a drug called 'Slo - mo' - personally I think they only added that in so they could shoe horn in some bullet time scenes...Lame film, sorry fan boys it might float your boat but it did nothing but sink mine...Only for the fans.",Dredd
398,Uberkills,Absolute Best Sci-fi Action flick in recent years,8,29 November 2014,"Although I know little of the 2000 AD comics of which Dredd is based on, I do know that the 1995 version was poorly made. Sometimes movies do deserve a remake. Judge Dredd needed one badly and in 2012, we got it.This movie does not waste time at all. Every scene is important and cuts right to the chase, no pun intended (the opening scene is a vehicle chase). The character, Judge Dredd is a somewhat emotionless, stone-cold cop that acts as a walking Jury, executioner and JUDGE in the Halls of Justice. A police department that operates in the new world of Post-Apocalyptic America. Specifically, this area is Mega City One, a sprawling metropolis that goes from Washington DC to Boston. Crime and gang warfare is at an all time high and it's up to the judges to send them to the iso-cubes or put them in bodybags.The violence in this movie is comic-booky very Tarantino-like book.. There are also a few scenes in colorful slow-motion which works successfully as part of the plot that involves a time-altering drug called Slo-Mo.Karl Urban who plays Dredd is excellent in it. You can't expect too much from the character but he makes Dredd like a complete badass. Olivia Thirlby is also great as Anderson, a rookie Judge that works with Dredd through-out the movie. My favorite performance in the movie would be Ma-Ma whom is played by Lena Headey. You don't get a lot of brutally sadistic female villains these days and trust me, she's pretty terrifying here.Dredd is the perfect movie to kill time with if you want to watch an enjoyable action film. It's highly re-watchable as well.",Dredd
399,lisa-629,Wow!,9,23 September 2012,"I will start off by saying I don't ever see action films. They are so awful lately (Transformers-all of them, Battleship...ugh), so I've been hesitant to commit any time to an action film. Thank God I switched gears with this film. I mean, from beginning to end, I couldn't look away. I've never seen the original, so I walked in with zero prior knowledge. The film is set in a futuristic, apocalyptic setting. Police are now combined with judge and jury, and choose on site the fate of any perp. The opening scene is Dredd pursuing three criminals, all of which are engaging in smoking a new type of drug that apparently slows down the users perceptions. Dredd is then paired with a mind reading newbie, and he is clearly not happy about it. Their first call is to a murder scene where three bodies have been thrown from the top of a slum high rise. Once inside, that's when the movie takes off, and I'll stop here. The remainder of the film had me on the edge of my seat. The acting is superb, the action is AMAZING, and the artistic flow is greatly appreciated in a Hollywood full of reality shows (Kartrashians) and terrible remakes (Footloose)....but this remake is a safe bet!",Dredd

401,elgronko,"Overly stylised, nasty violence with lashings of misogyny and adolescent machismo. Highly recommended.",8,7 September 2013,"Faithful to the original comics, Dredd is a violent, sleazy, pulpy adolescent fantasy packed to the gills with gore, drugs, dirt, swearing, misogyny, machismo and dystopian proto-fascist overtones.What a relief! I was so worried that I'd have to sit through another hopeless attempt to humanise the character, Stallone-style; still more worried that the filmmakers would attempt to emulate the satire of the comics' 80s incarnations, and in doing so take the source material waaaaay too seriously.Instead I got a permanently-helmeted Dredd administering graphically-violent judgment on the perps, based in a single apartment block (a wise decision taken presumably in order not to overstretch the budget) with a satisfyingly gritty atmosphere, spiced up with a few shots of Mega-City One to give the audience a taste of the general world Dredd inhabits.I'm fed up with superhero movies that masquerade as serious social commentary - anyone looking for social commentary from a movie should stop deluding themselves and pick up a book. I wanted violent escapism, just the same as when I read the comics as a teenager, and I got it.Ace!",Dredd
402,jodenband21,"Slo-Mo, Mo-Fo Connoisseur",8,9 January 2013,"Dredd is the kind of film that may satisfy Friday night audiences. Yes, it was fun, seeing a Mega-City One with the new 3D technology. It's more violent, relentless, and equipped with satire and deadpan humor. The action is peaked to the highest level of entertainment, probably not for the squeamish. The film is set in the dystopian futuristic United States, where it became an irradiated wasteland called Cursed One. Adjacent to the wall is the metropolitan civilization called Mega-City One where the crimes are inexplicably high. The Judge are the only reinforcements who acts as judge, jury and executioner. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is the ultimate judge, tasked by the Chief Judge (Rakie Ayola) for evaluating the new recruit Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), which is given a chance to pass a failed aptitude test; Thanks to her prestigious psychic abilities. Their task takes place in one of the 200-storey tower block called Peach Trees, where they are locked down by a drug lord Madeline Madrigal a.k.a Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) who kills three of his drug dealers by having them skinned, infused with the Slo-Mo, and thrown down the atrium. The Slo-Mo is some sort of asthma inhaler drug, which slows the perception of time experiencing reality at a fraction of normal speed.The plot is to take down Ma-Ma by reaching the tenement floor-by-floor to make it to the top. It makes me think of The Raid: Redemption, which is even better action flick. Despite the similarities, it's still an acceptable plot structure.You wouldn't watch this if it's not because of the gleaming 3D elements. It's just brilliant, makes us realize that 3D is a technical milestone ahead. The violence is gripping, by the time Dredd shoots the bad guys and blood splatters relentlessly. Every action scenes that is fueled by 3D elements is undeniably fun.Urban is good in acting as a dead-serious character that can crack a few jokes in a straight facial expression. Given his seriousness in character, he maintains a good Christian Bale like persona on a Magneto- like helmet. Olivia Thirlby holds a strong female lead developing a good chemistry with Urban, given the student-mentor persona. Fortunately, Karl Urban didn't took the helmet off, unlike Sly Stallone from the film Judge Dredd (1995) which didn't got it right. Instead, this new adaptation directed by Pete Travis is a new-improved retread and is simply excellent. Writer Alex Garland bolstered the script with sharpness and witty quips, correcting every mistakes that the film's predecessor made. Dredd is a mesmerizing 3D action mayhem bolstered with a powerful script, and serves as a correction for the inane Sly Stallone adaptation.",Dredd
403,Chiyonosake23,Breath of fresh air for true action fans,10,27 December 2012,"When i completely gave up on the action genre, along came Dredd. In an age when almost all studios go for PG13, almost all action movies are devoid of grit, grime, blood, suffering and guts, along came Dredd. This movie is genius. It takes me back to my childhood, when I watched Bruce Willis as he punched and shooted people in the face and smoked a victory cigar in the end, in his completely blood drenched t-shirt. I saw the Raid and while there are some similarities, this movie is more like the first Die Hard. And this is a huge compliment. The character of Dredd is absolutely awesome, kudos to Karl Urban, because there is no vanity involved, he never removes his helmet. The rookie is very human, fragile, but kick-arse at the same time, we can relate to her, and her story-arc is really satisfying. Not to mention Olivia Thirlby is absolutely gorgeous, and what makes her even more charming, that she is not pretty in the typical Hollywood-kinda way, but in a very unique way. Mama is a good villain too, they gave her a sad backstory, and a very graphic and satisfying demise. They did not shy away from gore which is good, this is a hard R and be very-very thankful that they still make these kind of adult movies for adult audiences, not just watered and dumbed down PG13 movies (Taken anyone? some comedian said: 3rd taken will be a g-rated movie and its title will be: Taken... to the zoo....He was joking but i can sadly see that happen). In a nutshell: please see this in cinema, buy the DVD, blu-ray, support this movie, because hopefully studios will realise, that this is how an action movie should be done!",Dredd

Not to mention how fresh it was, it is definitely not like any super hero film out there.The performances in this movie were AMAZING Karl Urban plays a badass Dredd and Lena Headay is perfect as Mama. Dredd was not an origin story, and you can say that they went too fast when they introduced the sidekick on the first movie, but we didn't mind seeing Anderson in this movie actually kept it fresh.Pete Travis does a great job directing the movie, the fight scenes were great, and the idea of introducing the drug ""slomo"" allowed Travis to let the viewers experience amazing slow motion and it have the story a nice touch.Dredd was a total badass, he talked like one, walked like one and definitely fought like one!

Perfect.",10,23 September 2012,"Pretty awesome film all around for action/gore/post-apocalyptic fans that dream of dirty and dangerous cities shrouded in cgi mist that seems to be a intimate part of nearly every film of its genre.Atmosphere: Couldn't ask for more here. Its everything you wanted in a film that doesn't hold back from showing you how rough life is within its universe. Judge doesn't give a crap about details: just a sentence. And he delivers, that's for sure.Characters: This movie type has been done before many times with shallow characters, so I didn't have high expectations when it came to character depth. Typical lack of back-story explaining ( I'm not familiar with the comic ) but that's OK because extra fat on the movie isn't necessarily a good thing. The latest Resident Evil addition is a perfect example of a film explaining itself to death before the action starts. This film was a breath of fresh air. Straight, to the point, and brutally succinct when it came to the characters.Story: Again, I'm not much of a story guy, I just like to see the bad guys (or woman) get his/her butt kicked or (kicked in!).

406,alan-chan-158-451491,A faithful and entertaining adaption of a British comic book icon,8,8 September 2012,"'Citizen, littering is against the law, the sentence is 5 years maximum security''Citizen, you have violated penal code 4412 and the penalty is...DEATH...BLAM BLAM' It was lines like these delivered by a faceless, po faced frown that made Judge Dredd the greatest and most iconic British comic book creation and easily up there with Marvel's more celebrated figures. Indeed, if the comic 2000 AD had been an American creation, Dredd would have been as illustrious as Spiderman and the Hulk. The good news is that Pete Travis has made an entertaining and exciting film that wipes away the travesty of the Stallone portrayal (made all the more risible by the fact that it was directed by an Englishman) and retains much of the iconography of the Dredd character: the permanent scowl, the lip curl, the low growl, his complete incorruptibility, the Lawmaster motor cycle and his Lawgiver in action; probably the coolest side arm in film.The story is simple – a rip off from 'The Raid' – and involves Dredd (Karl Urban) investigating three seemingly ordinary homicides in Peach Trees, one of the mega tower blocks in Mega City One which houses thousands of people, with a rookie Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) whom he has to assess. They arrest a gang lieutenant who is responsible for the murder of the three homicides and to prevent him from being taken into custody and revealing that Peach Trees is the central production and distribution point for Slo-Mo (a highly addictive and hallucinogenic drug that appears to slow down time to a tenth of a second), the gang leader, Ma Ma (Lena Headey) orders the assassination of the two Judges. The tower block is put into lockdown trapping the Judges inside. Their only way of escape is to advance up the tower block to destroy Ma Ma and her criminal gang. What follows is a pleasingly high body count as bloody mayhem ensures from within.Urban has nailed the sensibilities of the comic book creation (replete with deadpan humour), but it is clearly an imitation of Clint Eastwood and his 'Dirty Harry' character of the 1970s (upon whom the creator, John Wagner, modelled his character upon). The fact that Urban sounds so much like Eastwood cannot be unintentional and is slightly off putting if only because you are thinking about it throughout the film. Thirlby, playing the iconic Judge Anderson with the ability to read minds, is a fine counterpoint to Dredd's cool detachment and gives the film its emotional heart in the development of their paternalistic relationship. The effects of the drug, Slo-Mo, provides ample opportunities for the CGI artists to do their stuff and show bullets ripping through flesh, blood spurting from ruined arteries and bodies smashing onto concrete (you'll love and laugh at Ma Ma's demise).Overall, Dredd is a faithful adaption of the comic book hero and its box office success should lead onto ever more thrilling sequels that mine the comic's greatest stories. Roll on 'Judge Death' and 'The Cursed Earth'!",Dredd

Plot is not existent and the future is not very well portrayed: some newer buildings, styled-up bikes but the rest is today's or even older technology, so it doesn't even have sci-fi appeal.

Locked tower sort of environment feels like inspired from recent and very nice Indonesian movie called ""The Raid"" which would have been rated much better if was shot in Hollywood with English speaking actors. The main character feels and acts like ""Robo Cop"" is back. there is nothing really unique about the movie.. its like little bit of this and little bit of that put together, and that makes it boring rather than a chair grabbing, continuous action that makes you wolf down your popcorn when will you guys learn to invest those millions in new ideas rather than sitting and writing something based on statistics of what we liked in what movie and patching it all up with lights, flashes and expensive effects..i do have criticism about the scenario.. but in the end its a mindless ""shoot, blow, blood and smoke"" movie.. but still here is a few1. the way the bad guys take control over the place is stupid and too easy 2. why doesn't Dredd reload his gun from the first and second judge he takes down.. 3. wall, armor, concrete, steel anything piercing railguns sweep thru a floor, but our guy gets away going all directions thru the corridors. 4. the initial Judges take the call and come to the building,do nothing, report nothing, while things blast blow and explode around they wait like idiots at the door, .. odd !5. when the last dirty Judge shoots Dredd thru meter thick concrete wall with magical armor piercing bullets, Dredd survives, and after a quick patch up he acts and moves as normal. the thing is, lets assume a small gun could shoot that sort of bullet thru solid concrete, whatever behind that would literally take a massive hole, as the concrete pieces blasting out from the impact would magnify the damage drastically.. well .. not that i expect much reality in a scifi movie. just for the recordoh well.. overall not bad, lots of effects and all that.. don't expect wonders. if wasn't 3d i would say don't bother and wait for DVD.",Dredd

There are only a few complaints, however from me.I would have felt more pleased with this movie, it happens to be unable to draw on the potential it had.

Acting from all cast was top quality and enjoyed seeing Lena Headey from the terminator TV series as the bad character. 3D was quite good but not that much used compared to other 3d films. Thought the slo-mo drug story was good and stepping into the person view of taking the drug and it's effects was a nice touch. Wanted to see a bit more of mega city but happy enough with the peach tower storyline. The ending was pretty cool but a bit bloody as falling from a hight of 1km gonna leave a mark. Well done for a great Dredd film, hope there's more to come please?",Dredd
413,natcarr-74-27114,More gritty 70's action movie than comic book homage,8,6 August 2013,"This movie wrong footed me right from the beginning. As a big 2000AD comic fan I was expecting a gigantic teeming Mega City One with spiralling highways and gigantic hab blocks with curved architecture and no corners in sight! What we get is the 'burbs with a generous sprinkling of massive skyscapers. If that was a surprise then the first view we get of Dredd on his Law Master motorcycle was decided underwhelming. There's nothing wrong Karl Urban's Dredd and his outfit while against being made a little more practical that the comic version, is still pretty cool. BUT I hate the bike! The comic bike is this super cool hells angel style bad motor scooter from hell. Its a beast! The Lawmaster in the movie is a Japanese sports bike ""rich boy toy"". Lets just say that it wasn't the best start, but thirty seconds later we're enjoying a drug addled car chase that is straight out of robocop. In fact our chief protagonist has more than a passing resemblance to robocop, at the beginning at least. Is that bad? Not necessarily.This movie did grow on me though, I wouldn't be reviewing it otherwise. Once we get into the hab block where most the movie takes place we switch to John Carpenter's Escape from New York / Ghosts of Mars territory. The environment is a real slum while there is a sense of menace that resonates with Ghosts of Mars as suddenly everyone is out to get the heroes.Enter the totally awesome Lena Headey as the vicious MaMa complete was totally cool facial scars that does little to tone down her amazing bad girl sexiness, her character adds a little 70's grind house Black Ceasar-esque coolness to the party. I totally dug her . Stalone's Judge Dredd struggled due to there not being a decent villain. (They even messed up Mean Machine Angel for crying out loud!) Lena is menacing and psychotic with her contrastingly sweet gentle voice uttering monstrous edicts. She's brilliant foil for Urban's dredd.So what of Karl Urban? I give him high marks, he's got the Dredd scowl down to a tee and he chews his way through all comers like Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry. He even sounds like Dirty Harry and you know I reckon Harry Calaghan's whispered menace is a good fit for Judge Dredd! I thought Dredd rocked as the movie went on. Moving away from the slightly squeaky clean robocop and developing into a bad ass dirty harry style copper - a sociopath with a license to kill.That just leaves Judge Anderson played by Olivia Thirlby, The Anderson character holds her own in the script and Thirlby brings her to life nicely and is never an annoying pain in the ass like some ""boy wonder"" style super hero assistants can be, but at the same time that is exactly what she is, she gives Dredd someone to talk to to move the plot along explains all the exposition to the viewer. I hope she gets a chance to bounce off dredd in a sequel as an equal. She and Judge Hershey are much stronger characters in the comics than in the movies (to date). I also want to quickly mention that Anderson in the comic is one seriously hot blonde bombshell, while Thirlby is far more realistic and believable. this leads me to my penultimate paragraph...The Director, Pete Travis has intentionally moved away from the madness of the 2000AD comic to bring the story down to earth, and when I say ""DOWN to earth"" we're talking the dirtiest scummiest slummiest dump you can imagine and I grew to respect that as the movie went on. In the end I loved it. I still think Dredd can be fulfilled at his OTT best but I accept that it will be a movie that won't be to everyone's taste. Pete's version is possibly the ""safe"" take but luckily he goes to town with enough grime and crime to dodge that accusation... Just! So, to conclude, what we have is a movie that reminds me of Escape from New York, Ghosts of Mars, Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry with a fare dab of 70's Grindhouse and 70's action grit and sleaze! I mean that in a good way. Pete Travis wears his influences on his sleeve and he wants to pick the ball up and run with it. Put his own stamp in that kind of genre. What is there not to like? It's a good action movie!",Dredd
414,james-218-791197,"Easily misunderstood, but completely underrated",9,2 January 2021,"My problem with the '95 Stallone ""Judge Dredd"" film was it was too Hollywood. It was too slick, too commercial. Whilst it was a perfectly acceptable way of spending a couple of hours, it would never go down as a classic comic book movie.Urban's ""Dredd"" is a different animal. Where the Stallone film was tame and watered down, the Urban film is raw and direct. It is overtly violent- but the violence is certainly not gratuitous as some reviewers have noted. The purpose of the violence is to demonstrate how lawless and unforgiving the world has become.One of my bugbears of the Stallone film was how unfaithful to the comics it was. Hollywood has a habit of taking something pure, something with integrity, and commercialising it, watering it down, or embellishing it depending on its agenda. However, it did at least take parts of stories to create the script - namely the fact that Dredd is a clone and has a brother in Judge Rico. However, despite hundreds of potential story lines, the Urban film chooses to invent it's own protagonist in Madeline ""Ma-Ma"" Madrigal (Lena Headey). Ma-Ma isn't a badly conceived criminal, but I'd like to have seen a ready made protagonist from the comics.Beyond that, Dredd is an oddly unique experience. It's true that there is very little in the way of a plot - there's a triple homicide, Dredd goes to investigate, there's a lot of shooting, and in the end he hurls Ma-Ma off the top floor. It's the WAY the film is delivered that is impressive. The aforementioned raw edginess, combined with the knowledge that none of the characters have the same moral compass we do, creates a tense, claustrophobic atmosphere - it's edge of the seat stuff. Coupled to impressive visual effects - the SLO-MO scenes are particularly impressive - and Dredd is as close to a live action interpretation of the comics I could have hoped for.I would love to see a sequel. Carl Urban is excellent in The Boys, and is an underrated actor. If there is a sequel, it would definitely need to choose a story line from the comics - maybe Judge Death or a Chopper storyline would be good.As an aside - one reviewer marked the film down because the ""lead actor doesn't take his helmet off"". Judge Dredd doesn't take his helmet off in the comics. So yeah.",Dredd

416,attilabarcellos,As Dredd should be,8,7 June 2013,"Dredd is the guy. A personification of justice and the bitter medicine that is needed in Megacity 1. He doesn't hesitate, never, because there's much more work to do. And he is incorruptible, and doesn't care about rising in crime rate despite his efforts, because he is doing his part and doesn't have time for theories and chitchat. He is ruthless, also. And he applies the sentence the way the criminals kill their victims, to show them the pain they caused. Right or wrong, leave to the theoretical, because Dredd will keep cleaning the streets.",Dredd
417,m-a-elsewhere,"Finally, a Dreddnaught",8,9 February 2013,"DREDD is a stand-alone comic-strip adaptation with a sense of mission: to meticulously exact bloody justice for every last bonehead aesthetic crime perpetrated by the atrocious 1995 Stallone slapstick farrago. It does so admirably and in spades, becoming among the best action films of the early 1980s.Titular lead Karl Urban has yet to prove whether he has any talent, charisma or personality—which is, in this case, the right choice. His Dredd is faceless and cold, less a bot than Symbol-as-Weapons-System. Olivia Thirlby and Lena Headey provide enough emotion to propel the plot, playing intelligent, calculating antagonists. The film and vertical gauntlet setting are the real stars.Since it derives from a 1970s magazine called 2000 A.D., DREDD should be considered steam-punk: rather than reconcile a nearly 40-year out-dated futurism with the actual 21st Century, director Pete Travis and screenwriter Alex Garland create an alternate reality projected from '70s urban decay. The design and effects are appropriately, relentlessly retro—this could have been a state-of-the-art high-tech vision in the era of THE WARRIORS, ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK, and BLADE RUNNER. Released in 2012, it's still a series of visceral pleasures and thrillingly well- paced gore.Pity that DREDD didn't find its audience in theatrical release; so no sequel is likely to come. I suspect, though, the movie's reputation will grow over time.",Dredd
418,jdat_1990,Unbiased View of this Film,9,14 January 2014,"I just have to start out by saying: I loved this film. It had me gripping my seat. It had me chuckling at the one liners. It had me punching my fists in the air at the hand-to-hand action sequences. It had my blood pumping till the very end. I even smiled and felt satisfied when Anderson was finally approved at the end, even though it was obviously how the movie was going to end.But as I said, an unbiased review is needed, and I shall do my best:The make of the movie is like a first shot at a FPS game. There's an opening sequence in which you are taught the controls, as well as enough backstory to get you going. The plot isn't something out of a G.R.R. Martin book. It is simple, and to the point. Bad guys introduced promptly, and the way that the plot will go along is hardly rocket science. Bad Guys did a bad thing. Badass character to reach bad guys and kill them with prejudice. A gazillion small-time baddies to kill before we get there. Better get rolling.Next we introduce Rookie Anderson. A young pretty girl that initially failed the test to become a judge but is given a second chance because well, she's a psychic. Who doesn't want someone like that on their team? Dredd is not amused at being the one to score her performance, but he follows his orders to the letter, and not one step beyond. At first, you think that this movie will succumb to what many others have and make Anderson something of a Love interest for Dredd. I am happy to say that this did not happen, and we can move on.Ma-ma, played brilliantly by Lina Heady, is a sadistic bitch that rose to control of her area by sheer brutality and intimidation tactics. Beginning her career as a criminal as a hooker that effeminates her pimp while giving the guy a blowjob is street cred anywhere you go.The special effects were gritty for a reason. The budget was lower than a sci-fi usually gets, so they needed to make it believable without having the money to make something like the Avengers. It 'looks' like a FPS game. The gore is in good amounts but not delayed upon. It cuts short, brutal and quick. The editing on the Psi scenes is brilliant, cutting through unnecessary dilemmas and going straight for the nitty and the gritty. The interrogation sequence between Rookie Anderson and Jay is particularly terrifying. The slo-mo scenes are so good I could talk about them all day.The morality of the movie, which was what had most liberal critics' panties in a twist is, of course, an issue. Cops that don't need to rely on courts and juries to execute judgement does in fact raise a few questions. But think about it: You are living in a brutal world, where the criminals have taken brutality and violence to the next level. If Police were forced to maintain order under those circumstances, they would quickly lose the battle for the city.In essence, the plot is simplistic and to the point. Character development is weak, but that s mainly because Dredd has none. The arc for Rookie Anderson is well made though. The bad guys are bad, no questions about it, and you feel no remorse when you see Ma-ma plummeting to her death at the end. The effects were the best that could be made out of a low budget.To wrap things up, it is not a movie to watch if you are looking for romance, love, touching scenes and plot twists. It is a testosterone packed flick that is to be watched after a long and tear-filled evening of watching 'The Notebook' and Twilight, just to get your manliness reaffirmed. Enter expecting lots of gore, brutality and ruthlessness, and whatever the bad guys have planned. Don't watch it if weak of heart, politics, mind or stomach.",Dredd
419,krenwregget,really enjoyed it,9,5 August 2014,"I had no expectations associated with Dredd other than it HAD to be better than the Stallone adaptation from the 90s. My exposure to Dredd is limited as I'm not familiar with the source material, but the trailers for this new version piqued my curiosity.What followed was an incredibly raw, visceral, balls-to-the-wall, unapologetic action film with a true bad-ass at its centre.Carl Urban is fantastic as Dredd; a pure juggernaut of justice, putting a bullet between the eyes of any in his way with ruthless efficiency. The storyline is simple, but hugely satisfying in its momentum. I understand the budget was razor thin but this film is beautifully shot, making it look like a $150M blockbuster.Dredd hits every beat you want it to and left me very satisfied with a complete story arc and no open-ended sequel grubbing. I'm guessing the studio wasn't sure this film was going to work and I know it didn't do very well in theatres, but home release sales have definitely proved it worked.I can't wait to see more!",Dredd

421,rachel-673-19946,"Judge Dredd, dispensing justice one body at a time...",8,27 September 2012,"I feel a weird sort of shame that I did not see this movie in 3D. For this reason I really wish they'd stop including the visual format in the title of releases; sometimes it's just not possible to attend an enhanced session, and you feel like you've missed out on something, or have disobeyed an instruction, when you don't.Of course, that is why they do it; it's a cynical marketing ploy cashing in on that ineffable sense of wrongness that comes from seeing a movie entitled ""3D"" in a mere two dimensions. Those of us so afflicted will therefore often shell out the extra cash for the glasses and the brain trickery; to do otherwise feels so old school, the moviegoer equivalent of still carrying around an iPhone 3.Happily, DREDD 2D was such a good time that the lack of simulated depth perception really didn't trouble me at all.For anyone who cannot help but associate the name Judge Dredd with the appalling 1995 edition, just stop it right now. Scrub all of that from your mind, and imagine instead that this is your first trip to Mega-City One, its sea of humanity policed by a select body of almost omnipotent law enforcers: Judges, each invested with the power to arrest, prosecute and sentence wrongdoers – and then execute them.One such Judge is Joseph Dredd (Karl Urban), staunch, fearless, incorruptible. Into his care is placed one Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), a neophyte Judge with psychic powers, and wouldn't you know it, on that very day a brutal slaying has the pair heading into the Bad Side of Town. Soon they find themselves in a showdown with the minions of Ma-Ma (Lena Headey), purveyor of the latest drug craze, Slo-Mo. Slo- Mo locks its users into a trancelike state in which the world seems to go by at 1% speed, an apparently popular past-time. (It does seem like a strange feeling to purchase; what, they don't have Wagner operas, hospital waiting rooms and televised golf in the future?) Ma-Ma takes over a high-rise, and it is up to Dredd and his young sidekick to infiltrate the tower and Bring. Her. Down.(Spoiler alert: they do.)So much for the bare bones of the admittedly spare plot; if you're looking for intricacy and subtlety, then boy is this not the film for you. But writer Alex Garland (THE BEACH) is clearly a fan of the source material, because here is a Dredd painted in broad strokes of cartoonish extravagance, and yet the gritty intensity of the original's worrisome allegory is wholly honored. The appeal of Judge Dredd is that he and his fellows are legalized vigilantes: The Punisher, but with a LICENSE to kill. The turning of a courtroom drama into an increasingly creative bloodbath is the kind of thing only science fiction currently allows – until the inevitable LAW AND ORDER: POST-APOCALYPTIC DYSTOPIA – and Garland revels joyfully in the concept, giving his Dredd a precise diction and almost lyrical gruffness.Karl Urban, clearly having attended a master class in the Art of Gravelly-Voiced Quips at the Christian Bale School of Masked Avengers, plays Dredd utterly straight, and is utterly compelling, even as he delivers some of his more ludicrous pronouncements. Some might suggest that really anyone could have played this role, given that, as in the comic, Dredd never reveals his face, but in fact this makes the small moments of emotion Urban is able to convey all the more powerful, his outward impassiveness belied at times by only the flick of a shoulder or the quirk of a lip, saying nothing but signifying much.Meanwhile, Lena Headey, upon whom Cersei Lannister appears to have acted as a gateway drug into evil, is captivating as Ma-Ma, drug kingpin (queenpin?) and overlord (overlady? Wow, English is sexist) of the downtrodden and addicted. As charismatic and quick-witted as she is ruthless and hedonistic, Ma-Ma repels even as she attracts, and Headey makes her cold-eyed villain somehow almost sympathetic; she is ably assisted here by Garland, who gifts her with some of the film's best, if starkest, lines.The big surprise is Olivia Thirlby as Anderson, who pulls off action heroine in a way no one who thought of her as the weak link in the JUNO chain could have expected. (She was Ellen Page's ditzy best-friend. Remember?) All Bambi eyes and feathered hair, dialogue heavy with cliché and yet delivered with surprising nuance, Thirlby successfully conveys both gung-ho crime fighter and conflicted empath, making Anderson perhaps the most fully-realized character of the movie, and certainly the one with whom we feel most acquainted come the not-entirely- triumphant conclusion.Indeed, in many ways, despite being its titular star, Judge Dredd is the least important cog in the impeccably-constructed, well-oiled machine that is this story. Around him, complicated shades of gray swirl enticingly while he carries forward in straight lines only – often in both deed and word – a towering pillar of rectitude and righteousness. With a really, really big gun.Above anything, of course, it is the guns that make this movie, along with the carnage they wreak. The violence here is rampant and unrepentant; a love poem to the visceral thrill of holding the power of life and death in your very hands. It's part futuristic Western, where One Man IS the Law, but is also very much a product of today: not only a pro/con debate on capital punishment, but also a timely warning about the horrors of a police state, and the enormous influence wielded therein by a privileged—not guaranteed worthy —few. If we're not careful, that could be our future. On the upside, apparently it will be so awesome there that we'll want to live it at 1/100 pace. So, you know, swings and roundabouts, I guess.-- Rachel Hyland, Geek Speak Magazine",Dredd

A kind of Wyatt Earp of the future.But what I got was a first person shooter computer game, Dredd and his partner moving through different levels shooting up the bad guys and the storyline being driven by stops in the shooting and some dialogue from the queen baddie with absolutely no character development or humour.I rated it 5 because I did enjoy Lena Headley performance as the villain and some of the action sequences and the 3D were spectacular.",Dredd
424,akp0583,Dredd (Some Plot Examples),7,13 September 2012,"Starring: Karl Urban, Olivia Thirlbey and Lena Headey.Synopsis: In a violent future only the Judges stand in the way of total anarchy, they're Judge, Jury and Executioner in one. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) a veteran Judge is assigned rookie Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlbey) for assessment. As they look in to a triple homicide and the dealings of a new reality bending drug SLO-MO, the distributor and gang leader MA-MA (Lena Headey) traps them inside a two hundred story building and sends in waves of her gang to hunt and kill the Judges.Review: Dredd is an old fashioned action movie, high on violence and gore which folds around a simple plot and some gimmicky 3D sequences. I however did enjoy this film for what it is (all the above) the opening ten minutes shows you how on the brink of failure and anarchy mega city one is, as there are almost ten deaths one of which we see a villains head melt. Karl Urban (Lord of the Rings, Star Trek) and his chin give a great performance as the main character Dredd, an incorruptible figure of justice. Lena Headey (Game of Thrones, 300, Sarah Connor chronicles) as fun with a homicidal and angry character such as MA-MA, from the first moment we met the character you want justice and the plenty of death. Olivia Thirlbey (Juno, No Strings Attached) delivers a nervous Judge at first, but you know and early on that Dredd's ability and drive will make her character stronger. I'm not a lover of 3D and would say even though some scenes in the film look great, they won't in fact translate to DVD/BLU Ray unless you have a 3D system of your own. The look of mega city one is great but the majority of the film takes place in a skyscraper making me think there is so much more this world can offer, and hopefully will in any future sequels.

But Judge Dredd is on top of that list.I won't go into detail about how things have changed around the world in Dredd's timeline, but basically Judges are now street cops who can arrest criminals (or perps as they're called in this product) and sentence them on the spot without a trial. Judge Joseph Dredd (Karl Urban) is the most feared and respected Street Judge on the streets of Mega-City One (a huge city that stretched along the East Coast), he's a no nonsense type with a mean streak and doesn't take any crap from perps. After executing an armed robber, he is tasked with evaluating a rookie Judge, Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), a screw-up who possesses Psychic abilities due to being a Mutant. The Justice Department wants to hang on to her because of this.Dredd and Anderson are called to Peach Tree's, one of the many 'Blocks' that dot Mega-City One, (Blocks are self contained mini-towns 200 stories high), to investigate a triple homicide. Peach Tree's is controlled by Ma-Ma Madrigal (played fiendishly by Lena Heady), a drug manufacturer/distributor and psychopath who makes and distributes a narcotic called Slo-Mo, a drug that slows time down from the perspective of the user. (The slow-motion action sequences are stunningly shot, you really feel like you're off your nut on Slo-Mo)Ma-Ma puts the Block on lockdown, so the Judges can't escape and Dredd and Anderson slowly have to make their way to level 200 whilst being hunted by Ma-Ma's army of enforcers. Of course the Judges are well equipped to deal with them, armed with Lawgiver's, a pistol that has multiple ammo types ranging from High-Explosive, Incendiary and Hotshot, and a few other weapons at their disposal.So after many action sequences involving miniguns, corrupt judges and Anderson's psychic abilities proving to be an asset to her and Dredd. Ma-Ma is disposed of in spectacular fashion.All in all this is an excellent, and faithful adaptation. Dredd never removes his helmet (Unlike Stallone) and thankfully no token comedy characters. A good effort to all those involved.

Karl Urban is fantastically well cast and becomes the personification of Dredd. I'm tempted to buy some of the graphic novels just to re read the original strips and I suspect that, if I do, I'll hear Urban's voice speaking Dredd's dialogue.The movie is an excellent piece of science fiction and a strong action packed thriller.Even if science fiction or action movies aren't your thing the movie is worth seeing on principle. If movies like Dredd are not successful then you'll see less R rated films, less films without A list flavour of the month leads, less independent films with artistic vision.Or maybe you prefer the idea of a future Dredd film starring inappropriate charisma vacuum walking planks like Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise and his cute puppy sidekick.",Dredd

432,mpdmartin,"Brutal, beautiful and ridiculously entertaining",10,24 November 2016,"Dredd (2012) Reviewed by Martin Davis. Retrospect Film on Facebook When it was announced in 2008 that production would begin on a new Judge Dredd film, fans of the archetypal law enforcer of the future, from the pages of the 2000AD comic, could be forgiven for being less than enthusiastic. After the high expectations for the 1995 'Judge Dredd' version starring Sylvester Stallone, the pressure was on to get it right this time To put it kindly the Stallone film had been disappointing. The reboot would be scripted and produced by English author Alex Garland, who had written the acclaimed novel 'The Beach' as well as screenplays for the Danny Boyle films '28 Days Later' and 'Sunshine' and directed by fellow Brit Pete Travis. 'Dredd' arrived in 2012 and the fans finally got the Judge Dredd film they'd been waiting for. Whilst many felt the previous film was not much more than an action vehicle for its Hollywood superstar, with little regard for the source material, any such misgivings about 'Dredd' were soon laid to rest. No comedy sidekick this time. No love interest and perhaps most significantly this Judge Dredd would remain concealed beneath the famous Judge helmet. Crucial to the films success would be the casting of the title role and in New Zealander Karl Urban they got an actor who seized the challenges of playing the iconic lawman. With his menacing, gravelly voice and scowling grimace, Urban brings a gritty credibility to the part, no mean feat playing a character whose face is largely obscured for the films duration. 22nd Century North America is an irradiated wasteland, having been ravaged by nuclear conflict. Out of the radioactive deserts known as 'The Cursed Earth' have grown the Megacities. The biggest of these is Megacity One, a huge sprawling metropolis stretching the length of the East Coast. With a population of over 800 million, crime has spiralled out of control with 17,000 offences reported daily. There is only one thing fighting for order in the chaos, the men and women of the Hall of Justice, the Judges, given the authority to act as Judge, Jury and, if required, executioner. On a routine day on the job Judge Dredd is assigned to evaluate a rookie cop, Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) who possesses powerful psychic powers caused by a genetic mutation. A gangland slaying sees Dredd and his protégé sent to the notorious 'Peach Trees' block, a 200 storey vertical slum controlled by the ruthless drug lord Ma-Ma (Lena Headley) and her violent clan. Megacity One is in the grip of drug epidemic and it soon transpires that the drug in question, 'Slo-Mo,' is being manufactured and distributed by the Ma-Ma clan from their base on the 200th floor. 'Peach Trees' is put into lockdown by Ma-Ma and with Dredd and Anderson trapped inside and sentenced to death by her, a desperate and bloody attempt to reach the top floor begins. With a theatrical release in 3D that made stunning use of the technology, particularly in the 'Sl-Mo' and shootout scenes 'Dredd' was not a box office hit but has since gone on to gain a huge cult following with its home release. Made on a budget of $45 million, relatively modest in comparison to most modern Hollywood blockbusters and with exterior scenes filmed in Johannesburg and some 'Peach Trees' interior scenes filmed in a disused shopping centre in North West London! 'Dredd' is a brilliant and skilfully made action film that stands up to repeated viewings. Over the past few years there has been a growing campaign for a sequel or perhaps a TV series. With a wealth of material from the writers of 2000AD and with Karl Urban publicly stating he would be prepared to reprise the role, 'Dredd' fans can live in hope. Brutal, beautiful and ridiculously entertaining, 'Dredd' is a fantastic film. Martin Davis. Retrospect Film on Facebook",Dredd
433,MrRazorz,Pretty much all I could have asked for,9,5 October 2012,"To say I've been looking forward to seeing this film would be an understatement - I've been a fan of Judge Dredd since I was ten (that's going on three decades now) and to this day I still have a bad taste in my mouth from the (terrible) Stallone movie of 1995. So I'm both happy and relieved to say that - speaking as both a fan and as a film-goer - the new adaptation is pretty damn awesome. In fact, it might just be the Judge Dredd movie I've been waiting three quarters of my life to see.Like the recent versions of James Bond and Batman, the film takes the ""gritty real life"" approach to adapting the source material. The looming futuristic backdrop of Mega-City One has been dialled back into a sort of urban post-apocalyptic ""present colliding with the future"" kind of deal. Instead of the fascist police state of the comic, the city is presented as an ongoing ""state of emergency"" scenario, where the surviving population are crammed together into an urban jungle that's ill-equipped to house them all, and crime and anarchy are part of the daily grind. The Judges themselves aren't so much an all-powerful regime as a sort of provisional peacekeeping force, barely holding back the chaos (at one point Dredd says that they only manage to respond to six per cent of the crimes committed in the city, and it's implied that they have to choose their battles). It's not the Mega-City One from the comics, but it feels like an earlier, grimier version of it, and in the context of the film it works.I'll admit that I wasn't entirely happy with the 21st-century look of the city at first, but once they get into the Peach Trees block - where most of the action takes place - all my doubts were dispelled. A 200-storey tower block with 75,000 residents crammed together in slum conditions, most of them unemployed and/or criminals, with a murderous criminal kingpin running things from the top floor - that is SO Mega-City One.As for the cast – I will go on record and say that Karl Urban pretty much IS Judge Dredd. Urban is a long-time fan of the comic, and it shows in his performance (he reportedly only agreed to play Dredd if he kept the helmet on throughout - which he does). He manages to hit all the right notes while still making the character his own, and brings across the imposing authority mixed with a wry sense of black humour that's iconic of Dredd. You're two-thirds of the way through the film before he brings out the catchphrase ""I am the Law,"" but when he finally says it, you goddamn believe it.His sidekick Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) is a departure from the source material in a few ways. She's played as the nervous rookie with hidden strengths, as opposed to the tough wisecracking maverick she always was in the comic, and her psychic abilities are presented as a rare mutation and even something of a stigma (it's apparent that this version of Justice Department doesn't have a ""Psi Division""). But like the setting itself, you get the impression that this is just a younger, less ""tempered"" version of Anderson, one who's on her way to becoming the character we know. Her arc in the movie is basically ""rookie dropped into the thick of it who discovers her inner badass"" and, once again, it works in the context of the film.It's not a movie for the squeamish - it's bloody as hell, and not only does it not flinch away from the violence, it goes as far as shoving it in your face. When a movie features three men being skinned alive and thrown from the top of a building in the first ten minutes, you know you're not watching a PG-13. One trick the film pulls on you is using graphic violence in a stylish way that makes it seem less gratuitous than it is.Finally, the 3D. I'm not a fan of ""Real 3D"" - in most of the (very few) 3D films I've seen it's basically a pointless, tacked-on gimmick that distracts from the movie experience rather than enhancing it. But I can say (with great ambivalence) that this movie might have softened me up on the issue. Dredd 3D actually USES the 3D to its full advantage, creating spectacular action moments in slo-mo closeup where you can almost smell the smoke and feel the blood hitting you in the face. I won't say that it's changed my mind on the gimmicky nature of the format, but it should hopefully serve as a wake-up call to filmmakers by showing what 3D can do if it's handled properly.All up, this movie does Dredd justice (rimshot) while making the material its own, which is all you can ask of a good adaptation. If you're a Dredd fan you'll probably love it, and if you're not it's still a mighty good sci-fi action flick. There were several moments that had the whole theatre breaking out in applause, and walking out the door I wanted to turn right around and go watch it again. I think that speaks for itself.In fact, I have only one gripe about this film: Dredd never addresses anyone as ""creep"".Oh, well.",Dredd
434,andrew-76781,Thrilling and stylish,9,12 April 2020,"Great pace, effects, style, good job from all the actors. Special hats off to the set designs blending Johannesburg into the dystopian future city - loved the Peach Tree building!",Dredd
435,erikvanseggelen,"Grim, gritty, gory and gorgeous",9,11 March 2020,"Watching this in 2020 and this is such a relief from movies these days.This film pictures the distopian future this franchise needsThe slow-motion parts really sets this movie apart thoughWith more modern movies in mind that use the same technique i can only applaud the crew behind this for pulling it off on this budgetWatch it, it's just fun",Dredd
436,nmthomas-20486,"Excellent film, totally underrated",7,2 January 2021,"Overlooked, this has garnered a cult classic status. What I particularly enjoyed was the clearly defined characterisation. If a little shallow, the film took a leap of faith and didn't tack on a female as a love interest. Instead the two protagonists exist in symbiosis of what it takes to serve judgement.The character development for Dredd exists as an obscured face, in a film with intense pacing. I connected more to his gestures and body language rather than through the narrative. I saw his purpose through movement and behaviour, how he is a relentless machine dedicated to order and justice.The character of Mama is edgy, but campy. She is spiteful and vengeful with a general nonchalant disposition regarding brutal torture. She displays overtly psychopathic traits for control and wants the bearer of justice to be irradiated at whatever cost.The transformation into something that should be seen as less human, Mama is a formidable opponent.Her tyrannical and villainous actions are played out in dream sequences, with jarring violence and frantic gun fire. The character, however, is underused and it would have been interesting to include more socio-analytical content in terms of why women become corrupted due to experiencing violence and abuse.The representation of females is raw, if somewhat clichéd. Mama took control from her oppressor to become the leader of her 'fortress'. The block itself represents the walls that she has put up, I see the transition of Dredd going up the floors as an analogy of breaking down the walls of Mama's mind and finally confronting the murderous monster she has become. When she cascades from the window, her story rounds off with clear retribution. She is finally free as is all she oppressed.The character of Anderson is albeit the weakest but not unenjoyable. Her sequence with a captured scumbag, encapsulates well what women are subjected to societally and the links between drug trafficking and sexual violence. However, the character's psychic powers, which help her liberation aren't explored enough through dialogue or back story.I did enjoy the character becoming more savvy, less insecure and taking control. The moment where she meets the partner of someone she just shot, levies her moral dilemma of serving justice. I find the 'justice' enforced by the judges in this moment, is questionable and I found this to a good juxtaposing softness to Dredd.However, I didn't think these sequences were very deep, and covered basic emotional analysis about their roles to play within the moral corruption. The script is missing something, as it isn't as clever as it could have been. There are some missed opportunities to really bring to life some back story of the characters.I felt one of the weakest moments of the film was the Judges, called in by Mama. I am not quite sure the directors pulled off the action sequences or knew what to do with the confrontation. The only shock factor moment existed when one judge gets his throat punched in. The rest of the scene had a disjointed feel and very standard deaths. It felt like a missed opportunity to really see how a judge on judge battle would play out (seemingly epic).Overall, I enjoyed the score, the setting, the acting and cast and the pace of the movie. The dream-like cinematography and comic-book style graphics were also fantastic.However by far my favourite thing about this movie is Dredd's brilliant, nuanced facial expressions, the casting is brilliant in this instance.",Dredd
437,selfedluke,Top 3 Cyberpunk Movie All Time,9,2 August 2020,"This is my favorite cyberpunk movie after Blade Runner.Dredd is a tightly contained story about two cops ambushed in a 50,000 person slum apartment megaplex by a tortured-soul drug lord and her henchmen. Despite 90% of the movie taking place inside this building, the viewer is treated with some truly world-class lore/atmosphere/world building through the film's insanely slick cinematography and perfect set design.The Dredd universe-- overpopulated grimy sprawl a la Blade Runner-- is realized so well in the gritty and believable CGI shots of the exterior of the city and the various billboards, architecture, furniture, and signage that litter the streets. I really feel like this movie captures the mucky feeling of living in ""no future"" cyberpunk dystopia better than anything but Blade Runner.The action/shooting scenes are very well edited and choreographed. It never relies on quick cutting and shaky cams to shortcut the action like many action movies tend to do. You really feel like you're Dredd in some of these scenes- a tactical warrior that doesn't waste a step. Some of the sequences- the door breaching scene, the staircase shootout, and the encounter with the corrupt judges are so well done they border on mastery.The story is quite straight forward- you know more or less how it will end once the action starts going. But for Dredd, this isn't a weakness. It more than makes up for that with its refreshingly pure, intense, and authentic take on what could have been a B-level action movie. The script is excellent and is packed with memorable exchanges (particularly the scenes with Mama and her computer slave and Anderson and her captor). Alex Garland's (the writer/de facto director) wit shines here.",Dredd

439,Postal_Dude_Paradise_AZ,"the sentence is: guilty, the punishment is : DREDD",10,12 October 2012,"Well , someone, somewhere, in a world of pg 13 action blockbusters like the Nolan Batman trilogy or the Bourne saga, actually, in this age of phony politically correct nonsense, someone i was saying, managed to put a good movie adaptation of a tricky comic book like Judge Dredd in the friking screens , with a decent budget and a worldwide release. That, is something i wouldn't believe if promised, nowadays. The movie looks like John Carpenter in his prime with a tad of Robocop (2 especially) trowed in. Robocop is one of the greatest action movies ever, and captures the irony ,the satire of 2000 AD comic books perfectly.This movie eases up on the over the top social satire of the comic books, to perhaps appeal at a larger audience, and if you are a die hard 2000 AD fan, that may turn you off. Dredd is a very though human being in this movie, but he has a heart down there. So when in the comic books two teenagers firing at judged would have instantly have their torsos separated from their hips, here they get ""stunned"". There are many examples of that ""softening"" but to press on them would be completely unfair to those responsible of making this movie. Because they clearly cared loved and respected the source material, and in my consideration the sacrifices made to achieve this adaptation as it is, were worthy. This unfortunately , didn't break any box office record or nothing close to that, it's not the 80's anymore fellas... So i guess we can forget about a sequel, or a trend of action movies in this tone and style.But i guess this movie will be instantly considered of cult status, and may that be a reward to the intentions of the director and his crew. We are here guys, we appreciate what you've done, we are grateful, we know that this is how you adapt a though comic book icon, and how you shoot an action movie, don't worry , is not only Nolan/PG 13 action lover kids out there. We are here, thanks, sincerely.",Dredd
440,Iniquitous,This movie is exactly what it should be.,10,9 February 2016,"It is probably not possible to create a movie that more perfectly honors the soul of the source material. It is exactly what I needed to cleanse my mind of the pathetic earlier attempts in Judge Dredd. No punches are pulled for the sake of mass appeal. The players don't act against character. They act just as you'd expect them to based on the universe in which the story takes place. Watching the film now, well after it has been gone from theaters, the most disappointing aspect of the film is that it failed so utterly to sell tickets. Such faithful reproductions deserve to be rewarded, but the lack of revenue will only serve to further punish those who quest for perfection over popularity.This is the quintessential Dredd. There will likely be none better.",Dredd
441,sensorshot,Dredd,8,12 January 2013,"Enough water under the bridge since Sly Stallone's abysmal take on 2000AD's most successful character. We should all be grateful that Hollywood saw fit to remake it and do it in such great style without losing the essence of what is Dredd. This movie ticks the boxes for fans and first-comers alike. They skip swiftly to the action with only an outline of what a Judge is in this dystopia. We soon get the gist of it. I'd like to add that getting an actor on the rise to play a role where you don't get to see his face could have impacted a high profile casting. After all Stallone's ego over-rode the fact that Dredd never removes his helmet. That said. If other actors turned it down because of this it is their loss and Karl Urban's absolute gain - he nails Dredd perfectly and when he says Dredd's catchphrase, ""I am the law"" you almost want to jump out of your seat and cheer because you are so into ""his"" Dredd by then. Olivia Thirlby is extremely good in this and keeps Dredd balanced. The plot is very linear and I hope that enough people rent and buy this to get it the sequel it deserves. I think it was a bad move by Hollywood to make it R-Rated and any sequel could be less violent, or keep it off camera in order for it to get to the market it needs to continue as a franchise. The script is great and tight but the real payoff is the amazing electronic soundtrack. If you have surround sound and sub-woofer - you'll really enjoy this side of the movie. Cinematography wise it is very well shot and the use of colour saturation gives it a unique feel.Please watch, rent buy this movie so that there is the chance of a sequel where we can get deeper into Dredd and Anderson's background.",Dredd
442,er_jose_a,Pure action,8,21 January 2013,"Dredd (2012) This is a pure action movie, I'm not a big fan of this category but I have to say that this was really good, if you want to see bloody action this is a film you definitely need to watch, but is more than shooting scenes, while all this action is happening they explain everything (not too much but at least the necessary): Why? How? Who? Where? When? Etc The effects are good and the details in the slow scenes are awesome, I have to say that Karl Urban (Dredd) did and amazing job, he never takes off his helmet but just with his voice and his body language he catch your attention, I like ""rookie"" the mutant that go with Dredd because she was a little scare and insecure first but in the end she wins attitude and that was cool, the actress do a nice job bringing her to live in this film. This is definitely an entertaining movie I enjoyed very much.www.facebook.com/ElementaryTips",Dredd
443,andyunderhill72,Blew Me Away,10,30 January 2013,"I'm going to keep this review brief, as all I have to say has been said dozens of times before. But Dredd is a great example of what the modern action film should aspire to be. Gritty and gory without a NEED for flash or dozens of special effects on screen at once.Dredd got to the point without any time wasting and delivered absolutely everything it needed to and more. Characters were good and interesting, cinematography was great, story was interesting, and the pacing never let up.The effects that WERE in the movie never failed to impress. All of the slo-mo sequences were genuinely gorgeous to look at and added so much to the scenes it was used in. This especially was helped by the fact that there wasn't slow motion just for it to be there, it actually had an important place in the story.The 3-D of this film also worked better than most 3-D movies, but that barely matters in this review.This film not making more at the box office is a crime.",Dredd
444,diadectes58,Extremely gory,6,30 March 2013,"Far too gory for my tastes. That's why I only give it a 6 and not a 7. I started watching this movie on DVD while eating my tea and wished I had not. I had to keep turning away. It's not a bad film really with a decent plot and pretty well acted albeit in video game style (like Resident Evil). The movie would have been much better without all the slow motion gore though - it is good enough to succeed without it. It has one of the best of all types of story - set in one place at one time about one event (like High Noon) which makes it very easy to watch and digest. The villain is extremely unpleasant and nasty - which helps. Do not expect a re-make of Judge Dredd (1995) starring Sylvester Stallone - it's totally different. Over the top: yes. Gory: yes. But, still a half decent film.",Dredd
445,koriandr_star,Detailed and realistic,10,8 September 2012,"I rate this a 10, it's not THE best film of all time but it was solid entertainment that was true to it's source, the setting isn't in a glossed super tech future or absurdly over populated slums. Instead we get a complex structure, a blend between 'old earth' and mega city one. In short mega city 1 is a mess.They made the dredd costumes look practical and effective, with casting very strong, especially lenda's role of Ma-ma who is a truly terrifying character and yet convincing as a leader.Characters play perspective of the setting, Dredd is pretty much the unforgiving force of law whilst Anderson shows us the other side, the emotional harm that the law dishes out.The film lacks humour, it's cold, gritty and almost terribly real of human evil and of gang culture, but it never strays from it's main source.The real question can they make this into a effective series? Death, or the exaggerated mutants won't fit in this down to earth take on this, but it is very good.",Dredd
446,moneyboy,Now this is the Dredd we've been waiting for!,8,9 November 2012,"Now this was a brilliant surprise & what I expected Dredd to be!After the Hollywood abortion in which Stallone played a camped up Judge Joseph Dredd, destroying any semblance of the being, persona & force that Judge Dredd was portrayed in the comic world, I can happily report that Dredd delivers in spades. (I almost burnt my 2000 AD's in protest of Stallone's Judge Dredd! I mean Jesus all they had to do was pick-up the comic to realise how far off the mark they were with that POS film they made)Over the top, brutally violent, atmospheric, action flick that represents the 2000 AD Judge Dredd which us fan-boys/girls have waited and wanted for a longtime. The team of Alex Garland(he of The Beach/28 Days Later fame) & Pete Travis do a great job of bringing the comic world of Dredd and Mega-City One to the screen(thank f*** for that!). Karl Urban is excellent as the cold, steely, almost-emotionless Dredd.The film is relentless and flies along at a cracking pace. Saw it in 3D and didn't actually mind it. There's some great sequences and some brutal slo-mo death sequences. Fantastic use of sound, quite aggressive use of surround effects. A top soundtrack make it a complete film for me.Shame it hasn't had the success that it should have, but those of us familiar with Dredd & 2000 AD world will dig this film(no doubt already having seen it). Those looking for a cracking action flick set in a dystopian future check out Dredd before its run ends @ the cinemas. Highly recommended.8.5/10",Dredd
447,azeron40,Awesome Judge Dredd movie,9,30 July 2019,"Well worth a watch. Karl Urban is the best anyone could hope for in a Judge Dredd movie. Yea I am late reviewing this title, it had good reviews, people just had such a bad taste in their mouth after the Sylvester Stallone, version which was mostly a long commercial, that they did not go see this one. which in my opinion is a terrible loss, to all involved.",Dredd
448,Jeff_Donnah,Violence is fine if it has a purpose,5,27 September 2012,"It seems the movie was attempting to be ultra graphic. Dredd is close ups of heads being collapsed. I was frankly disappointed at the depth movies are attempting to go to show pure graphic violence in intense slow motion detail without any real attempt at a solid story line.This may appeal to some people and while I really enjoy action movies, with or without graphic violence, the lack of any real depth in the storyline made it painful to watch.The TV series Spartacus is similarly graphic, but it has a storyline that matches and makes sense. This is just pure graphic violence in slow motion, up close and personal. If you like that, you'll probably enjoy the movie.",Dredd
449,funismyname,This was good.,9,21 May 2013,"At first I was upset because I had seen The Raid: Redemption and had read the reviews on this movie. Then I saw the film. Taking the plot from one film and merging it with the world of Dredd really works. This feels like the first Hard R rated comic book property released. It is long overdue. Kids read comics because they are R-Rated, then the films are released in PG or PG-13. No wonder they fail. There is a character who is a mind-reader. That was dumb. It removes some grit and adds ""kiddie movie"" substance. Lena Headey also comes off as annoying but not tough. She's totally unrealistic as the overly built up character she portrays. The look of dissatisfaction that she's carried from role to role kinda annoys me too. She comes off as a wimpy villain who talks the talk but can't walk the walk. Besides that, I have no other complaint. Karl Urban is perfect. His acting nails the role. He better be in the sequel. The set design, and action were brilliant. It makes me really happy to see the Stallone version of this get replaced by something serious. That PG garbage reminded me of the pathetic TMNT movie with Corey Feldman. It gives me hope that someday someone will make the Punisher and not screw it up. I truly hope to see more of this adult franchise. And I hope all other comic book adapters wake up and target their true audience, the Hard-R, adult audience. PG-13 is for filmmakers without courage or vision. Maybe they should ask Freidkin to direct one.",Dredd
450,MovieNewsAndUpdates,This Dredd Is More Dreddful,8,27 December 2012,"Dredd is an incredible adaptation of the British comic book Judge Dredd, wiping out all the bad memories of the then 1995 Judge Dredd. With a more gruesome, violent and dark approach towards the presentation of the movie, It delivers a beautiful visual and an extremely engaging cinema. With a moderate production budget this movie delivers way above expectation. The look of the movie is stunning and completely believable, working on dystopian future of US, the look of the city, cars, architecture, and especially uniforms of Judges which was really frustrating to see in the previous adaptation of Judge Dredd. As far as the cast of the movie is concerned Karl Urban as Dredd and his baritone voice delivers am impressive role of Dredd and so does Olivia Thirlby as the new recruit cop/judge. But Lena Headey as Ma Ma was the best portrayal of a negative lead seen in recent times. With a complete justice to the role and creating fear which at times could even be felt by the viewer was commendable. The story is simple with the characters keeping us engaged, it is also the CGI effects which make the scenes of the effects of drug Slo MO as fascinating as it could be. But it is the writer Alex Garlend and director Pete Travis who deserve the most appreciation for bringing this character from the dead and reviving in a way from which many will expect even a sequel. With a fantastic script, actors, direction and CGI work only where needed, this movie is definitely worth a watch.",Dredd
451,interquam,A low budget winner.,8,21 September 2012,"A slo-mo erotic euphoric thriller.A great film..... simply because of the unabridged and unpretentious mature content.lena headey' s best role thus far.Thought Karl Urban at some point might remove his helmet to show his face but not once in the film did he reveal his face...Olivia Thirlby was bridging the ridiculous ""teen crap"" but makes a good cadet, she is convincing..........much better than Nooomi Rapace in Prometheus.Deobia Oparei --- karl's co-star from doom makes a welcoming role.....someone you cant do without.A cheaply made film in close quarters to save on money and animation has the same feeling like Total recall(2012)....but great direction, screenplay and cinematography.....makes me thinking this part of the early century is about leviathan city blocks as its main theme?? hmmmm.....The whole slo-mo ""druggie"" theme isn't a pleasant one but is executed exceptionally.Lena Headey as an ex-hooker named ""Ma Ma"" and called ""Ma"" with her sharp features ......can make men go wild(the name in the film only adds more erotic appeal).......no not sexual but wild.....men want to be her slave. Be at her beck and call.....maybe get too many wet dreams....STOP!!She is a drug-lord supposed to have absolute command ...but she looks well nourished ...her skin looks like she is a vegetarian ....she is glowing.The film is basically a parallel to max payne...the whole druggie erotic theme.I don't know who compared karl with Sly .....but both the Dredd films are very different. They have nothing in common and are totally different. Both films are independent and great though the older one had a looose ending with not so good co-actors.The actors, side-actors, co-actors are worth it. A promise kept.........though the druggie theme might not appeal to many Lena Headey does justice and boy she looks erotic!! ......Olivia Thirlby wasn't left behind. There is a difference between eroticism and being sexy.. sexy is immature, cheap, vulgar and after a sometime becomes obscene ........eroticism is art, exploring sexuality-- which is domain of an experienced thinker and BLAH BLAH BLAH.

I was very skeptical when I first saw this movie available to watch because of the horrible Judge Dredd with Stalone. Karl Urban was the perfect choice for the role and did not disappoint. If his frown of disapproval could dip any lower it would drag on the floor. The action sequences were vicious and raw. Ma-Ma (the villain) is a welcomed change from the typical crap they feed us today. At times the trainee seemed a little un-realistic, but for the majority of the film she did pretty well. Dredd is the hardened judge, jury and executioner that we all deserve. Be prepared for a hard hitting man movie!

And must of all to to tell a story with action as it's main focus.This isn't a deep, abstract or a beautiful movie, but for an action flick it actually took me back to the likes of classic action movies with a heart, like; Predator, Die Hard, Terminator and Robocop, where you are involved with the characters and the action, and know what is going on, instead of just having 1000 computer generated objects flying at you at once..

I'd heard people liked it, and I'd heard others hate it, so it took me some time before I finally got around to checking it out. Though I'm not terribly disappointed, this is definitely not going to be a film I recommend to anyone.I understand that the idea is that in this dystopia the Judges are judge, jury and executioner due to the high crime rate that is inevitable with so many people squeezed into so little place. And I also understand that Dredd is supposed to be this hard-ass legendary Judge that knows what he's doing, and seemingly lives only for his job and nothing else. Karl Urban plays the role well. Though I couldn't help but laugh at that frown of his.Sadly, Urban is the only thing that really stood out to me. I don't have a lot of good things to say about the CGI, the blood and gore just looked way too fake, and the script was sub-par.

The acting was bad (with Ma-Ma being the worst), and the plot was pretty empty. The lead character sounded as if he was trying to sound like Clint Eastwood. The best thing about the movie was the set. Beyond that, it was as if a group of 12 year olds directed and produced the movie. Unlike the original, there's nothing very futuristic about it.

458,cake-26,Not all that,6,7 September 2012,"The film suffers from it's tight budget. The future should be expensive to film, so we don't really get much 'future' here. Also, it should have been sold on the 'Dredd' stuff, ie. making fun of Dredd's humourless character, colourful villains, lunatic citizens etc, but this is all dumbed down to make a pretty uninspired formulaic action thriller. You've seen this plot a million times. I thought the movie was clichéd and boring and not really much to do with Dredd. I'm a hardcore old-school Dredd fan and am disappointed with the look of the thing. Dark, grimy, claustrophobic, cheap, not like in the comic. The helmet is wrong, the lawmaster is rubbish and Anderson is not as hot as in the comic. All the reviews that are hailing this as the 'real Dredd' etc, are just reacting against the previous movie's obvious flaws. They did an OK job considering the constraints, but this is far from being the definitive Dredd. Go read some of your back issues if you've forgotten what that is.",Dredd
459,thecamillocienfuegos,Futuristic Action from the Old School,8,21 September 2012,"In a post-apocalyptic near-future, urbanization is 100%, and the vast megacities are the crime-ridden hell on earth that you would expect them to be. Judge Dredd, a new kind of policeman with the powers of judge, jury and executioner, works the grim and futile beat of Megacity One.The plot of Dredd is rudimentary, set predominantly in one city super- block, without the 'epic' feel that so many modern action films try to evoke. To those with bigger-the-better sensibilities, it may seem a little underwhelming. But the simplicity of the film is also its strength. In place of complex narrative requiring lengthy and tedious exposition, the focus is firmly on characters, action and the superbly conceived vision of a disturbingly credible near-future.The action, as the 18 rating suggests, is brutal and visceral, but avoids the more gratuitous excesses that the certificate would permit. The few sexual scenes are also very restrained, and instead of trying to shock the jaded 21st century audience with sex and sadism, Dredd opts for the artistry of super slow-motion action, which evokes the gory exit-wound frames of the original comic. The soundtrack is also very effective, lending a dark energy to proceedings.Anyone who loved Terminator and Robocop will love this film, which in many ways is the most worthy successor to their dystopian visions of the future and inhuman anti-heroes. Not that Judge Dredd (played to perfection by Karl Urban) is actually inhuman. But with his face concealed by a mask and his feelings concealed behind a robotic infatuation with the Law, he is the next best thing, growling deadpan one liners that rely on the audience's sense of irony, rather than bombastic delivery, to provide the humor.As in Terminator and Robocop, the humane and sympathetic role is left to a woman, in this case Dredd's rookie partner Judge Anderson, and as in those 80s classics she is no damsel in distress despite her human qualities. Anderson provides a welcome measure of empathy to the grim narrative, periodically reminding the audience that perps are humans too. In my opinion it is these few thoughtful moments that raise this movie from great fun to genuine class.Overall, Dredd is by far the best action or sci-fi film I have seen in ages, certainly the only one that has left me wanting more, rather than wishing it had finished 20 minutes ago. The depth of the source material, and consequent potential further exploration of Dredd's world, is a huge bonus. A solid eight and a half out of ten all day long.",Dredd
460,phonenumberofthebeast,"A great Dredd movie is probably impossible, so I'll settle for this",8,7 September 2012,"Judge Dredd is arguably the only genuinely famous comic book hero to come out of Britain, a hinterland in a genre overwhelmingly dominated by the US, Japan and France. And even so, he still lacks the global reach of Naruto, Batman or even Asterix. There are many reasons for this; first, Batman and Superman are easy to pigeonhole, because their stories are largely about them. However, from his inception, Judge Dredd, both the man and the comic, have always been more about the universe he inhabits, which means that any depiction of Dredd outside his comic homeland comes saddled with a huge amount of backstory. Also, the comic, with its unrelenting mixture of misanthropic cynicism and fatalistic humour, strikes a uniquely British tone that is unlikely to appeal to foreigners, particularly Americans. Although I described Dredd as a comic book hero, he really isn't: he's a fascist; the unbending arm of a totalitarian regime. The tragedy of his world is that it makes him necessary. The true villain of Dredd is not Dredd, nor the perps, druggies, demons and robots he combats, but you, the reader, for settling into a cowardly state of ineffectual consumerism and letting your society dwindle to nothing. Not really a positive message to send to the wider world, and this movie wisely doesn't try. After the disastrous Stallone vehicle in 1995, which blundered spectacularly by making Dredd a hero, studios were understandably loth to bankroll another one, meaning that this movie, whatever its intentions, would be hamstrung by its budget. Rather than a jupped-up take on Blade Runner's Los Angeles, Mega-City One now resembles present day Detroit with a few concessions to the future, such as mile- high city blocks, thrown in. By zeroing in on two Judges and their actions over a single day, this allows the producers to save on dollars and the writer (28 Days Later's Alex Garland) to ignore many of the comic's wider and more troubling implications: the Judges are treated as a simple police force, rather than a fascist police state; the people are treated as cowed innocents, rather than hedonistic dullards prey to every fad or scam that comes along. Instead, the movie focuses on pure action, and any allusions to the comic's moral message are made through the sets, cinematography, and unspoken communication, rather than histrionically preached in dialogue. This works, and as the Stallone movie amply showed, is the only way a Judge Dredd movie could ever work.Given its financial limitations, the movie rises and falls on its storytelling, acting and direction, and on all counts, I give this a pass. Karl Urban is far too restrained to really capture Dredd's flamboyant personality; ironically, Stallone's over-the-top, overblown performance in the 1995 adaptation is in many ways closer to Dredd in the comics, though the comics play it for laughs, while Stallone wanted to be taken seriously. With laughs thin on the ground in this adaptation, Urban is forced to rein himself in, and so at times Dredd comes across as a simple honest cop, rather than the square-jawed embodiment of Law he is meant to be. I was not initially happy with the casting of bubbly, apple-cheeked Olivia Thirlby as the weary, hatchet- faced Anderson, but her character won me over, partly through writing (she is now a rookie one day away from washing out, rather than an experienced, accomplished Judge) and through performance (Thirlby showed a grit I hadn't seen before). Lena Heady, playing the crime boss Maw- Maw, is of course, note-perfect, as she can perform this kind of role in her sleep. On a technical level, given its budget, the movie does pretty well. The CG shots of Mega-City One are seamless and the slo-mo and psychic effects are suitably trippy, without inducing migraine. The action scenes are well-choreographed and, miraculously in this post-Bay universe, easy to follow. There is little I can say beyond this without spoiling what plot there is. However, it is a very competent action movie that manages to capture something of the spirit of Wagner's seminal comic. I can only hope it is a smash hit, and we are then granted a sequel with sufficient budget to bring us more of Dredd's vast world.",Dredd
461,antoninisk,Finally.Dredd comes to life!!!!!!,10,29 September 2012,"I cant help but begin the review with a comparison.This film sets right the crime that was committed 16 yrs ago by the movie with the same name.No punchlines no comic reliefs no idiotic plot twists to keep everyone happy.And this is not about a movie star at his prime making one movie after another.This is a true portrayal of a comic book hero.This is what a comic book should look like on the big screen. This is a film for dredd fans as well as anybody who likes action movies.You wont regret seeing this one. Mr Karl Urban makes an excellent portrayal of dredd.He doesn't try to play tough like his predecessor with unnecessary tag lines and growls and winks.No.Remember that idiotic line ""i knew you'd say that"" every five minutes on the previous movie?NOT IN THIS ONE!!!! This Dredd is smart.He plays the part.No crappy heroics. Ms Olivia Thirby is excellent at the part of the empathic Anderson.While her comic character is a little less serious(at least on the first editions),yet her performance is that of a true rookie. Praise on Mrs Headey.She truly is Ma-Ma.Drug addict,killer,prostitute,gang leader. In all a complete movie with a simple yet effective scenario.No plot holes.No mistakes(at least no major ones).Die hard fans will certainly find minor comic differences but they are trivial.Unlike the massacre that was done with the 1996 film.With probably 1/10 of the budget of the first movie this one gives you the gloomy Mega city 1 and you buy it.Simple but clever sfx make worth while every second. I just hope they continue this franchise and see a couple more films like this one.I cant wait to see Judge Death,Hershey and why not Brit-Cit,Hondo City,East Mega city etc. But i'm getting ahead. See this film!Its worth your buck!",Dredd

Many friends of mine also into films for years have encouraged me to watch the film, for one reason or another it didn't happen. Until now.I've given it what I feel is a fair 5. It's not completely awful by any means but no way is it a 7 out of 10. I found myself wishing it would end so I could put something else on. Watch Robocop instead.",Dredd
463,mlbit,Terrible film - simply a collection of slow motion special effects,2,2 March 2014,"I cannot believe the reviews praising this joke of a film. I'm certain they didn't watch the same film i did. . This film was merely a collection of slow motion special effects with some torture and gore thrown in to please the stupid. There was no real plot or story at all. The acting was, well at some points laughable. Watching this was more like participating in a very poor computer game where the objective is that you have to pass certain obstacles to get to the next level. All in all i would recommend watching the 1995 version of Judge Dredd, with Stallone and Bullock it maybe cheesy but you'll enjoy it whole lot more, and at least it has a decent story.",Dredd
464,darrenandgwen-661-168573,A solid action movie but underwhelming Dredd film.,7,27 February 2014,"If Dredd was a series then it would be a solid storyline. Unfortunately this is a movie and for fans of the comic book character this is a frustrating film. On the one hand it is fantastic, dark, brutal and with a wonderful performance from Karl Urban. On the other as an introduction to Dredd's world of Mega City One and a fascistic, post apocalyptic world it is underwhelming. Stallone's Judge Dredd failed mainly because it tried to do too much, squeezing decades of storyline into one film. Dredd's failing is the opposite, it is too small and coming a year after the excellent 'The Raid' seems to be too close in theme and environment to this superior movie. That said, Dredd is a great action piece with solid action and visuals, it is just here at the wrong time. Too late for action fans who saw this in 2011 with the aforementioned Raid, and after Marvel set the bar with Iron Man and The Avengers, it does too little for fans of comic book movies. It underperformed at the cinema but has done extremely well on Blu ray and DVD thanks in part to a fan led campaign and we may yet get a sequel. The cast and material certainly deserve another chance and hopefully any further entry into the series will pay attention to the failings of the first two entries into the world of Judge Dredd.",Dredd

I read the comics as a kid and trust me when I say, if you don't already know, the dark judges was the plan for the sequel. They should of at least started with maybe one Dark judge in this movie to help push it. Its 2020 and I know this movie didn't do well at all for the sequel to happen.

466,AmbushBug26,Stop Comparing It To The Raid.,8,25 September 2012,"I love how people say this is a copy of ""The Raid""....what makes it a copy? Because they're trapped in a building and being hunted by an army of people? I don't know about you, but if someone asked me ""what was that movie with the policeman getting trapped in the building while having to fight off a bunch of enemies?""....My first thought would be ""Die Hard"" not ""The Raid."" Similarities aside, this is a really well done action movie. It's nothing special, but it's surely not a waste of money. In fact I feel kinda sad that this film isn't doing so well in the box office. It's one of those films you have to see in theatres....especially in 3D. The Slow Motion shots in 3D are just mindbogglingly beautiful. I'm surprised nobody has ever thought of doing something like that before.As for the actors, they're all really good. Nobody really brings in a bad performance, but there are a few weaker links. Karl Urban owns the role of Judge Dredd, and pulls off a great performance even though most of his face is covered (That says something). He just has this aura of ""don't mess with me"" and when a bad guy does just that, you know that it's not going to end well. I also really liked the girl who played Anderson. Obviously she's supposed to be the person people tie to emotionally, let's face it, it's kinda hard to relate to a fascist almost robotic police man who views the world in such black and white terms. The rest of the actors are good but kinda forgettable.The villain is interesting, but we aren't really given a lot to care about. She doesn't even have that ""don't mess with me"" vibe like Judge Dredd did. Which is a shame because most of the best villains in film and literature have that. They do try to give her that vibe and for a brief moment almost hit it, but it's just not enough. Lena Headey's performance is good but she isn't given much to work with.The best part of the movie is easily the scene with all the Judges, I won't spoil it for you readers but that was the moment I truly fell into this movie and knew this film would be entertaining and boy did it pay off. Well done.Also Judge Dredd's gun is really, really, really cool.I don't know what else to say, it's really one of those movies you just gotta grab a few friends together to go see it with. It's a popcorn film through and through, but it's a dang good one. I hope word of mouth convinces more people to go see it or it at least achieves Cult status.I went in wanting to be entertained, and I got just that. But can we please stop comparing it to ""The Raid"". I liked the movie, but ""The Raid"" isn't that original either it took it's cues from ""Die Hard"" just like this film probably did. Do the math, ""The Raid"" was released the year this was being filmed so I doubt they we're ripping it off since they had already had a script and were in production by then.Good film, quite entertaining, check it out.",Dredd

468,drharper,Not Dredd,2,10 October 2012,"OK, neither was the last one. But even though Stallone took his helmet off (gasp!) it was still closer than this one. Last time they tried to capture the Mega-City 1 of the comics. This time, it just looks like a regularised LA with added dirt. Dredd may not take his helmet off but he does shave... Add in corrupt judges, a loss of all flying traffic, grungy judge uniforms (Stallone got THAT right, at least), and a complete lack of any robots at all and it simply doesn't feel right. I admit I prefer the early complex Bolland artwork, and this is a lot closer to the later, grungier and less precise stuff, but I have read the comics and I do think this is simply wrong. They make interesting use of the 3D effects, and some of it is good. But not enough. I have read that critics hate it but users love it. Does that make me a critic?",Dredd

471,kallepalli-sashank,High-Octane and Razor-Sharp. 95 Minutes of Awesome.,9,7 October 2013,"Judge Dredd in 1995 came out as a big budget box office romper- stomper...it made more than it's estimated budget and ended as a moderate success and was heavily panned by critics but the movie still ended up as a cult classic. I remember watching it as a 6 yr old when it premiered on cable in '97 and even now makes a fun watch for die-hard 90s fans like myself.When I heard about the development of Dredd back in early 2012..my first reaction was..""Why?"". How could somebody take a comic book character who ended up as a flop on the big screen and try churning out something better nearly 17 yrs after one big failed attempt? Initially I was reluctant-as-hell to even think about it..but later I felt I had to give it a shot and trust me....it just blew me a mile away.This film reaches probably the pinnacle of excellence in the department of simplicity and class and here's why : The director needed an actor who could have a rugged yet soothing presence,Not too much money spent on fancy skyscrapers and high end whiz-bangs,An amazing level of importance towards photography which turned out to be the spine of the film,Hyper-realistic action sequences,some of which will drop your jaw to to the floor if you've actually seen or heard of live combat tactics.These key features make the film an absolute ripper. And as far as the acting's concerned..Karl Urban finally finds his spot when it comes to good roles just when everybody thought that he was probably destined for supporting roles.He brilliantly maintains a calm yet menacing demeanor which turns out to be the perfect character for his role as Judge Dredd. Lena Headey plays the nefarious Mama with such panache and suave making female villains of the past look like soft candy. As far as the action sequences are concerned,the art of CQB(Close Quarters Battle) has been shown to perfection and it's so realistic that for a moment you almost forget that it's a movie and being a movie buff since the age of 4 I can tell you that I have not seen that in many films. The only flaw I can find is that the photography regarding the intoxication associated with the drug SLO-MO through the film gets too garish and makes it quite stifling..that aside it's a high-octane action thriller which is definitely fresh and worth more than just a mere watch!",Dredd
472,mauvemage,He is the law!,8,12 September 2012,"First up, Karl Urban, who is a terrific actor, would not have been on my list to play Dredd. Boy would I have been wrong. The grizzled cynical and deadly lawman is played pitch perfect. As in the original comic, he never removes his helmet, but managed to convey the man perfectly through his words and actions.Action is what this film really excels at. Alex Garland, the writer, gets that Mega City 1 is terrible place, constantly on the verge of tearing itself apart and that violence is a part of everyday life for millions.Dredd, along with rookie judge Anderson, have to take down a heavily armed gang in a 200 story tower block, which the gangs leader, Ma Ma (played by a scary Lena Headey) has sealed off from the outside world.It's tough, it's brutal, yet manages to keep some humanity via Olivier Thirlby's Judge Anderson, who is on her first active mission and goes through a slew of emotions as the chaos unfolds around her.If your a fan of action go see it. If you love the Dredd comic, it's a must.",Dredd

My local cinema only had 3d showings so I went along to an early evening performance.The movie is excellent. I suppose it could be said that the early chase scene freeway and vehicles look too contemporary but that didn't diminish my enjoyment of the scene. Most importantly Karl Urban is Judge Dredd in every way.Anderson is played by Olivia Thirlby, an actress I hadn't heard of before this. I will make a point of seeing other films she has been in. She is excellent as Psi Judge Anderson..tough, sexy and providing a spark of humanity and idealism to counter Dredd's ruthless cynicism.The action scenes are excellent, the cast fantastic and it looks astonishing.One of the things that most impressed me was the 3d. Obviously I have nothing to compare this to but I've had negative comments about films being shot in 2d and converted. The 3d in Dredd is totally immersive. I honestly felt as if I was in the thick of the action at times.I genuinely advocate watching this film on the big screen..haven't seen a 2d version yet but it is worth the 3d price.",Dredd

Every penny is well spent...visuals are great, without overdoing it...ambiance was so Megacity like...and finally a really great script - intense, interesting and original...in line with the overall feeling the original comic book gives you.

476,F_Mizra,Superb Adaptation,8,5 October 2012,"I confess I never knew anything about the Judges, the comic book, and so on. For those amateurs like me, this film is a reboot from 1995 Sylvester Stallone's Judge Dredd and adapted from a British comic strip. In the post-apocalyptic wasteland, the people no longer live in nice decorative homes but in tall huge buildings – more like 200-story of slum. The dystopia residents of Peach Trees tower are controlled by the prostitute-turned-drug-lord Ma-Ma, where she is the sole provider of newly-created drug called Slo-Mo. The only law enforcer in such metropolis are the Judges – given the power to be the Judge, the Jury and the Executioner. When Ma-ma orders the execution of three sorry-asses (skinned and pushed down from the top), fear consumed the city, thus Judge Dredd and rookie-mutant-psychic Anderson sent by the Chief Judge to bring order.Ma-ma's henchman, Kay is arrested. To prevent him from being interrogated (remember Slo-Mo business??) Ma-ma hijacked the security and made Peach Tower as the battling ground for the capturing of Dredd and Anderson. The hunt begins! Sit tight and be amazed with the exploding limbs and splattering of blood here and there.The film deserves high appraisals for its tremendous action, sequences, cast and background music. I personally like the scenes when they busted Kay and the gang, and during the gun massacre! Darn wicked! Some elements/scenes will make you think of The Matrix (slo-mo scenes), Robocop (the helmet/costume and passion), the Terminator (loyalty and obligation) and Die Hard (kicking-ass actions).Bottom line is, this film is prone to be having sequels and with good- will, becomes another awesome action-hero trilogy like many other comic adaptations.

478,ffuuut,A good action film. See it in 3D if you can.,8,4 November 2012,"This is the first 3D film I have seen where I actually couldn't imagine it any other way. The imagery and the film itself were so enhanced by being in 3D. A film not for the faint hearted, as it is bloody and very violent. A simple tale, that doesn't delve into any real back story or character development, but the three leads do really well with the material. Karl Urban is almost robotic, yet completely believable as the title character, Olivia Thirlby is fantastic as the rookie psychic and Lena Headey is incredibly deranged and menacing and unfortunately not attractive (so not the norm!) as the big bad.The set design and special effects are great and there was a very clever ploy by the script writer to include a street drug that's affect is to make one feel as if they are in slow motion, which allowed the director to go for broke with the use of super slow mo to fantastic effect, especially in 3D.The film was also surprisingly dead pan and funny.A good action film.

At the glance, Dredd looks like The Raid Redemption, but it is different because The Raid is fast paced mixed martial arts flick in a building where a bunch of cops were killed by mafia gang where as in Dredd movie, same plot follows in gigantic Peach Trees housing complex in very advanced high technology style and I am sure many people will love this action. Dredd is such a great character because he executes bad guys and he is incorruptible, and will always fight for what he believes is right, despite the danger of doing it. If it is right or not, the movie leaves to the audience. Karl Urban is excellent as Dredd. His voice is pretty much how I've imagined Dredd to sound for 25 years and his lip curls and jaw acting are fantastic. The rookie Anderson was played by Olivia Thirlby and again, she was excellent. I feel Anderson is a bit touchy feely but here her vulnerabilities added to the character and in truth it's really her film by way of character development. Overall I like this movie.",Dredd

He is so powerful and a little bit cruel. This movie told about Slo-Mo (a kind of drug) that give effect slow motion. The effect of this movie is quite good, especially the effect of Slo-Mo.

His ego was right, his scowl was right, the uniform was right, the darkness of the sets was right, his size was right, his stature was right, his voice was right and the bike was right.You can't just put anybody into the uniform (or what was hoped to be passed off as a Judge's uniform) and call him Dredd. In the scenes with more than one Judge, you didn't know who was who at times because physically, Urban just didn't stand out. The producers should have at least made him eat a few steaks a day for a few months to beef him up.Guess someone thought that he could do a Nolan and put a comic book character into a backdrop of modern day U.S.A. and try to fool us that that was Mega-City One. It worked in Batman because there was so much more going on there to keep us glued.Anyway, I wonder how it would have turned out if the Stallone one had the budget of this one.",Dredd
483,thetrev,"Pretty good, but sloooow!",7,28 September 2014,"Straight up, the film is good and has a lot of action. The acting is decent and the costumes and weaponry are generally pretty cool. The problem for me is that I was actually hoping for the action I grew up with in the 2000AD comics.For those unfamiliar with the comic, this is probably not something which will trouble you, as the action and setting are dirty and gritty and realistic. However, I would have liked a little more comic book action. OK, I understand there will be changes and these are necessary in some cases and acceptable in many. The redesignation of Judge Anderson as a rookie and a mutant (In the comics she is already an established Judge in the Psychic Division) was OK and allowed a context for the story and for some character development (not Judge Dredd's personal strong point). What I found was that in trying to make the film a bit more realistic, it lost some of its character.One of the main problems is the Judge uniform. In the comics it is rather large. Sensibly, the costumers have thinned it down. However, all that body armour is not going to make it easy to move the way Dredd does in the comics. In this film, he is reminsicent of a cross between Dirty Harry and Robocop and moves like them. In the comics, Dredd is very lithe and athletic. he thinks nothing of jumping around, something which only happened once in this film (other than when he was trying to outrun the heavy machine guns). Strangely enough, another piece of realism which affected his movement was the use of realistic police firearm techniques. In this film JD moves with his pistol in 2 hands... In the comics he almost always fires one-handed. The use of a two hand grip seems to slow both his movements down and the action. Real;istic though it looks, I'd been hoping more for a John Woo style of action.The tone of the film starts well, although I found Mega City 1 surprisingly empty and unfuturistic. Had it been a modern cop action flick, it would have been nrilliantly set, but considering this is supposed to be at least the tail-end of the 21st century, the clothes, forearms and cars (they still have VW camper vans!) were just a bit 1990's. It was a bit like having a Die Hard car chase in Model T Fords. For me, this emptiness of the streets and the early 21st century gear robbed it of its futuristic appeal. Sorry, but the Stallone version at least got this right.Once I'd got over the shock of Judge Dredd in 2012, I sat back and enjoyed the film for what it is, a stylish, well-made, tightly done action flick. No big surprises, but some nice touches, especially from Judge Anderson who came into her own in the mind-reading scene.I'd have still liked a few ""Drok It!""s though!.",Dredd
484,billhilario,Nice,9,30 October 2018,"Not bad, really. Plot and fight scenes are far more decent than the original movie. Plus, Dredd didnt show his face which gave more focus on the character's gritty, badass persona.",Dredd
485,Tomas_T,British comic 2000 AD's antihero Judge Dredd finally receives a worthy film adaptation.,7,12 March 2013,"For those not familiar with Judge Dredd's character, the comic is set in dystopic future where the only thing standing between order and utter chaos are the ultimate law enforcement officers called Judges. These Judges, empowered with authority to police, judge, jury and execute criminals on the spot are the true embodiment of police state and authoritarianism. Dredd's world is a grim and oppressive as one can imagine and depicts one of the worse case scenarios to which another global conflict might plunge mankind. The bleak and unconditional world makes Judge Dredd the perfect comic character for an action film and thankfully Dredd does not disappoint.The film does not sport a big budget or complex script which at times shows as average special effects and lack of grand story elements, but what it lacks in budget and complexity, it compensates with sheer attitude. The story is fitting in its simplicity for a straightforward action film where Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is dispatched to investigate recent murders at one of the huge ghetto skyscrapers of Mega City 1. Tagging along side with Dredd is a telepathic rookie Judge Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) and together they plunge directly into the hornets nest to confront with a ruthless drug lord MA-MA (Madeline Madriga) and her countless thugs.Truthfully Dredd does not bring anything ground breaking to the table, but the production stays true to Judge Dredd character and Karl Urban gives a credible performance as uncompromising and absolute Judge Dredd. Due to the budget constraints, simplistic script and action orientation, Dredd is not out there to win any grand prices, but it does pay much deserved homage for the legendary British cartoon character and is overall a very decent action film.",Dredd
486,buter1,"Solid action movie, but a bit too gory. 3D made it bomb in box office.",7,27 September 2012,"I watched the new Dredd movie today. It was actually pretty good, though a bit more gory than I care for. Karl Urban and Olivia Thirlby both were excellent, as were most of the bad guys. There were a few unnecessary extra gory deaths, but if I remember the comics right, that happened a fair amount in them.The movie definitely had the right atmosphere. It was quite obvious that gangs were the day-to-day enforcers, but that Judges were feared (and kind of admired) by the general population. The tech was awesome (especially the pistols, which had voice commands to select ammo type).I was kind of surprised that Karl Urban did not show his face even once. He always had his helmet on. I'd heard this before, but I really figured they'd find a way to have his helmet off for at least a little bit.Olivia did a great job as a psychic. The movie is mainly about her first day on the job. I really liked how the movie dealt with her first field execution, and its affects on her. I won't go into detail, but it did not avoid the fact that she is judge, jury, and executioner, and she is aware of just what that means.The bad guys were decent, though definitely more gangbanger punks and not some supervillain, like many comics movies would feature.Overall, I recommend the movie, at least on DVD, for any gamer. Dredd fans will likely be pretty happy with this, as well. My only issue is that I think the ultraviolent deaths early on weren't really necessary. As the movie went on, most of it was toned down, but early on, be ready for some gross deaths and corpses.I saw the movie in 2D. I really, really wish the studios would stop wasting money on 3D. Guess what, I will not watch a 3D movie. I don't need the headache. Sadly, the movie is apparently a flop, and the 3D is likely part of the reason. Overall, I'd give it a solid 7 out of 10.",Dredd
487,chris-musico,Not too bad.... But still bad...,5,20 September 2013,"The first Judge Dredd movie with Sly Stallone was pretty bad so I wasn't expecting much of this movie until I saw the ratings in here. So I decided to watch it and even though the story line and action was more solid, the CGI effects and the green screen action footage was really bad and very low budget. All the blood was poor quality CGI, making what could have been an awesome movie into a low budget B grad straight to DVD movie. Not good enough guys....

488,adogg4629,unrelenting-my 1 word summary,10,24 September 2012,"First off, let me say that I am biased to this particular comic book character. I've been a fan since the late '80s and have wanted a film adaptation for a long time. I am not saying that I am pre-disposed to like this film. In fact, quite the contrary is true. I'm not only coming at this from the point of view of somebody who wants to see a good movie, but as somebody who will be judging this by its adherence to and respect for its source material.I've been disappointed before. The Stallone version of the '90s failed this test on both counts. In fact, the only thing that movie got right was a few beautifully rendered hyper dense scenic shots of Mega City one. This film didn't have those shots. In fact, the scenic shots of the city didn't seem that dense at all...yeah there were tall building....but spaced far apart. It seemed almost like a quaint small city trying to be a big one at the edge of a dessert. That is...until we are taken inside the city.This is one of the real coups the film pulls over on us. A few quick shots of the area around these mega blocks (big...REALLY big...More then twice the size of the Twin Towers big) reveal some familiar (especially if you are a New Yorker) buildings that frankly look like kids toys in comparison. When we are informed that the city has over 800 million people covering a land mass that stretches from Boston to DC, you have to intake air when you realize the true scale of the shots looking at the city from the dessert. We are quickly given a day in a life type story focusing on two characters who have an importent yet oddly impotent job in the city. To maintain order. And it doesn't take too long until we realize how futile that task is in a city so enormous. The plot details are somewhere along the lines of a Die Hard film from that point on, but the feelings this setting evokes in us are more akin to District 9. It's an all together beautiful and disturbing combination the filmmakers utilize quite adeptly. At some point we are inside one of these big blocks, and the Judges (a hybrid cop/judge given powers to dispense instant justice) we are following through their sadly ordinary day had to shoot lots of people and utter caustic lines like ""Defense noted"" or ""you have ten seconds to comply"". Did I mention lots of people get shot? Well... let me put it this way: LOTS of people get shot. And we are not spared one ounce of gore when this happens. The film never really lets up, rather it moves at a brisk pace as our protagonists go about their job. The titular Judge Dredd is the experienced mentor, putting Judge Anderson through the ropes here. For those of us familiar with the comics, these are the two biggest characters in the world of Mega City one. While Anderson does go through changes, this film gives us a bit of her origins (placing this story actually BEFORE the comics really take place). While she goes from barely competent and wishy washy cadet to the beginnings of the kick ass PSI Judge we all know and love, Dredd himself never breaks a sweat. In fact, you get the sense that this particular day was no better or worse for him then the day before or the day after. His actions in the last scene of the film really hammer this home.This characterization is what really makes the film work. The sense that this is the norm in this city informes us of the prevailing fatalism that must soak into every citizen. It is a very bleak dystopian view of the future, that sadly looks all too understandable and real. We are never told how the human race came to be in those cities, or why they still exist there. It's only that they ARE there. And it's left up to us to fill in the importance of that.",Dredd
489,alimuhdshahid,'Dredd' - one of surprises of 2012 & one of the best action movies...,7,26 October 2012,"I'm a huge fan of Superhero movies and have been since I first started watching movies. The 1995 'Judge Dredd' was not one of my favourite superhero movies. Judge Dredd is not your normal kind of superhero. Were Superman is an alien, Hulk has awesome power, Iron Man and Batman have their gadgets and Thor is an almighty god. Judge Dredd has a gun which can fire multiple types of bullets. Unlike other superheroes who want to 'save' people, Judge Dredd just wants to serve justice to people. Superhero movies are nice to watch. There is humor, action, a bit of romance, a bit of suspense and thrill, fantasy, all in all a complete package of entertainment for PG13. But 'Dredd' is different. There's blood, loads of blood, amputated bodies, a lot of gory stuff and brutal, absolutely BRUTAL action set-pieces and loads of swearing. For a superhero movie 'Dredd' is quite different.Don't get me wrong, it's still an awesome movie. Not boring at any stage of the movie. Its fun all around but its not very audience friendly when it come to kids watching this movie.So, the acting in the movie is spot on. There's no role that was left asking for more. The script is very fast paced and very well written. Karl Urban is just awesome as Judge Dredd, a big improvement on Stallone whose robotic acting left me wanting more. Olivia Thirlby too was brilliant. Honestly I wasn't quite excited at the idea of a woman being a judge let alone Olivia Thirbly (short, blondegetting the point?), but she does really well and most of the time steals every scene she's in.Lena Headly as 'Ma-Ma' is decent. There's not a lot she says in the movie. She's not even showed that much but her presence (as a woman mind you) is sometimes terrifying. She does the character justice (get it? :P).The direction and the cinematography is brilliant and goes very well with the movie. Pete Travis and Co. have done a very commendable job here.All in all, 'Dredd' is one of the surprises of this year. With it's fast-paced storyline, awesome and brutal action scenes it is quite simply one of the best action movies of the year.",Dredd
490,Lionheart490,"Small-scaled, gritty, trippy, fun, and an overall great representational of the source material",8,16 September 2013,"Episode #9 of Lionheart490's IMDb Movie ReviewsThe new ""Robocop"" trailer really got me interested in the kind of satirized violence-ridden media, like ""Robocop"" and its inspiration ""Judge Dredd"". Not the really bad Sylvester Stallone vehicle, the gritty and gory comic books that satirized the violence and legal-actions of media. It deconstructs the kind of ""Dirty Harry""-like action heroes who would take the law into their own hand and kill as many as they please. In the dystopia world of ""Judge Dredd"", that's how the law works. The first movie didn't get that at all, luckily ""Dredd"" was only able to faithfully portray its source material well to the cinematic treatment. It is also a very fun and gritty action movie. The movie manages to provide an interesting original story using the characters and setting from the comics. One thing that works for the film is that it's a pretty small film. It only takes place in one large building that holds a whole section of people. This is especially compared to the two biggest comic- book movies of that year which featured grand scenes featuring the heroes dealing with large threats like an alien invasion and the takeover of an entire city by criminals. Nothing against those great movies but after some such grand action and epic scale, it is definitely nice to see something on a much smaller scope. Dredd knows the kind of movie that it wants to be and it does it very well. Karl Urban perfectly portrays the simple yet interesting main character, Judge Dredd. JD is the kind of character that isn't prone to emotional development, which is why the addition of the rookie Anderson (played by Olivia Thirlby) works very well. Dredd does some very interesting things that makes it stand out. For example, it manages to use the tired cliché of ""slow- motion action scenes"" and makes it an important plot point. Dredd's visual style combines gritty survival with some trippy visuals that works without providing mood whiplash. It is a very gory film but the blood is intentionally ridiculous splatters, so it doesn't get disturbing or exploitative.Overall, Dredd is an enjoyable movie that captures the spirit of its comic book origin while providing enjoyably brutal action. It is a shame that this movie bombed in the box office as I am definitely enjoying this movie's cult audience who want to see a sequel to this film that explores more of these characters and setting. Even if we don't get a sequel, I think Dredd works a solo film that recommend you check out. I give this movie a 8/10.",Dredd

492,cwilliams72,About time they gave Dredd a decent chance on screen,9,26 December 2012,"I'll keep this short and sweet with no spoilers. I had some severe reservations about Dredd with the casting of Karl Urban and having seen the trailer but having seen the movie I have to give it a huge heap of merit, if not for undoing all the harm that Stallone did to the character back in the 90's.Urban may not have the physical presence expected of DC Comic fans but he does the infamous Dredd frown to perfection. It must have hurt to hold that frown for weeks of filming. Another plus, you never see the character remove his helmet or prance around in a sheer vest as Stallone was prone to doing.Olivia Thirlby also played her role well as Anderson and it was engaging to watch her take on the role and develop her character during the movie.I'm still enjoying recollections of the movie and will be watching it again soon and eagerly anticipating the next instalment with the hope that we'll see more of Mega City 1 and Urban's capabilities with a Law Giver.",Dredd

Well that's because nobody bothered to go and see it...and that's a tragedy because this movie is really good. Really really good. It doesn't care about how everyone else in Hollywood would have made it. It doesn't care about the disgrace that Danny Cannon emptied from his bowels into our cinemas and it doesn't care about how other comicbook movies are handled.

494,Particle-X,drokk! a huge disappointment,3,2 October 2012,"let's just summarize some essential Judge Dredd facts from the original comic: it's the future, after an all-out war only a handful mega-cities exist, completely overpopulated with an unemployment rate around 90%... space is scarce, therefor the buildings reach absurd sizes and shapes. 24/7 traffic jams, flying cars... lot's of'em, illegal air board races, gunships, block-wars, ABC-robots, etc... add to that at least 10 buckets of black humor wrapped in exquisite critical sarcasm. now here's my quiz: find and list 3 futuristic items in the new ""Judge Dredd 3D""! this movie really looks like it was made for 1% of the budget it would have needed. starting with a cityscape that looks somewhat like Johannesburg, loosely populated with Nissan buses driving on pretty ordinary streets, pickled with some ""mega-blocks""... we then have to suffer a lengthy clone of a ""die hard"" plot that revolves around an illegal drug which slows time down for the user without any other side- effects it seems. wow... that is one terrible substance! don't do it! but hey, luckily there's the Judges! genetically bred super-cops with an arsenal of overkill high-tech gadgetry like ehm... er... motorbikes! and... handguns with a tiny display! everything here seems to be barely on a ""mad max 1"" level. top this off with wooden characters and dialog... well. thank you. notice how the poster shows all blocks on fire and close to each other? i guess they had to compensate for a completely missing ""mega-city"" there...in short: a disappointing low-budget fan-boy movie that completely lacks absolutely everything essential about the original Judge Dredd universe. i simply can't imagine that somebody familiar with the original world of Dredd can get anything out of this movie. this is somewhat reflected in the ""critiques"" in favor of this movie, which all pretty much boil down to: ""uh... it's not like the other dredd, uh-huh..."" or: ""if u like sploshuns, bullits and ded peeples, dis movie is for u!"". i can imagineyes... the 1995 Dredd movie was disappointing, but let's be fair: besides the character depiction and the lame buddy-story, it had a TRUE ""Mega City"", mutants, robots, pretty cool vehicles and lots of characters... and that was 1995 with no CGI, OK?",Dredd

497,S-Hite-Forbranes,Drokk Sylvester Stallone. Rob Schneider is a Piece of Stomm. Praise Grud for Karl Urban.,8,8 March 2019,"I have been a fan of the Judge Dredd comics since I was ten years old. I have all the Eagle Comics Dredd issues, Dredd Rules, and the early issues of Judge Dredd the Megazine (all still in mint condition). I could never stand the Marvel/DC superhero trash and the crass commercialism of these companies, even as a kid, I was a big fan of the independents such as Dark Horse, Eclipse, 2000 AD etc.The 1995 Stallone turkey definitely reproduced the visual aspect of the comics faithfully, the production design was very good, Mega City One looked as it should, the Judge's uniforms were translated in a faithful way and it contained all the elements familiar to fans of the comics: Judge Hershey, Rico Dredd, Mean Machine and the Angel gang, the Cursed Earth, the SJS (although they were stupidly re-named Judge Hunters for the morons), Fergie (unfortunately portrayed by the pathetic Rob Schneider). Where the movie failed abysmally was casting Stallone as Dredd and Rob Schneider as the comic relief, the bloody awful script, and the attempt to humanise Dredd and make him a sympathetic character. Dredd is a fascist bastard, a rigid adherent to the law, he is an anti-hero, not a nice guy at heart. Something the producers of the 2012 film understood, this is Dredd as he should be.I have noticed a few inaccuracies in the negative reviews from people who claim to be life-long Judge Dredd fans. One complained about the lack of flying vehicles, well there were no flying vehicles in the original comics, only in the '95 film. Some complained that the Lawmaster motorbike wasn't the same as in the comics, the Lawmaster bikes looked awesome in the comics, but they wouldn't work at all as a real-world design, with tyres that fat they wouldn't be able to turn corners. Some trashed the uniforms but these were a realistic interpretation, which incorporated most of the iconic elements, the uniforms in the comic looked cool but were totally impractical in a real world sense. I also want to clear up the misconception that Dredd has NEVER removed his helmet in the comics. Dredd was depicted without his helmet on quite a few occasions in the comics, although HIS FACE WAS NEVER SHOWN, it was swathed in bandages, or obscured by shadow. In Tales of the Dead Man, Dredd is out of uniform, NO helmet at all, although his cowboy style hat's shadow obscures the part of his face normally covered by his helmet. I mean does Dredd sleep in his damn helmet? Unlikely.At first I was wary of the new Dredd film, I had seen some photographs from the South African location, which were decidedly underwhelming, was this Dredd to be set in contemporary times I wondered? I needn't have worried, the more real-world interpretation of Mega City One was believable. Some negative reviewers complained that Mega City One was not futuristic as it should be, but they didn't have the budget to depict the more traditional futuristic Mega City One from the comics and the '95 film, so they extrapolated Mega City One from contemporary cities, with the comic's tower blocks represented and I thought the new Mega City One looked quite good.The story was not adapted from a storyline in the comics as the '95 film was (The Return of Rico), but there have been vaguely similar storylines in the comics. The film did not have the budget to portray an epic story, and I had no problem with the film being restricted to one location. I am just glad they didn't go with the Dark Judges/Judge Death story arc, as I always hated these stories in the comics, for me these supernatural stories never fit in with the more traditional science fiction of the Dredd universe. Karl Urban nailed Dredd's character perfectly, the emotional arc of the film was Judge Anderson's (here a rookie, compared to the experienced, wise-cracking Anderson of the comics). I am a fan of Lena Headey's work, and thought her portrayal as the sociopathic drug-lord Ma Ma, was very good. One negative reviewer complained about the corrupt Judges in the film, but there were many corrupt Judges in the original comics. This is why the SJS (Special Judicial Squad) exists, they are the despised Internal Affairs division of the Justice Department, and many Judges have been sentenced to twenty years on the penal colony of Titan for corruption (including Rico, Dredd's clone brother).It pisses me off that we never got the Dredd sequel we deserved, yet they keep on pumping out these overblown Marvel piece of sh*t superhero films by the bucket load. This doesn't bode well for the cinematic adaptation of Timothy Truman's Scout that is being developed, with a screenplay by Truman and his son. Scout was a brilliant 80's Eclipse Comics series featuring Apache vigilante Emmanuel Santana AKA Scout, and his adventures in a near-future dystopian America. Updated for the 21st century, this would make a great film, but if it does actually get made I bet it will bomb just like Dredd, because most morons believe comics begin and end with Marvel and DC.Dredd succeeded where Stallone's Judge Dredd failed, by accurately capturing the essence of the character, and for me Karl Urban is Judge Dredd. John Wagner, one of Judge Dredd's creators, stated that for him this is Judge Dredd done properly, and he likes the 2012 film. Well he should know, and supposed life-long Judge Dredd fans who bashed this film should shut up and take heed, do they know the character better than one of his creators? NO they sure as hell don't. This is Judge Dredd as it should be done, don't believe the haters.I have read they are developing a Dredd TV series, Mega City One, based on the 2012 film with Karl Urban returning as Dredd, and I can only hope that this actually goes into production.",Dredd
498,chuckwheel,Loved it,10,23 September 2012,"As a 42 year-old, lifelong Dredd fan, I can only say that, as far as I was concerned, it was a near perfect adaptation. It felt very true to the source material, but also contemporary and relevant. And please, I am not talking about that terrible Stallone version from the '90s, but the original comic book series.On the surface it's pretty much a straightforward action thriller, but there's really a lot more to it than that and it definitely merits several viewings. Excellent production design and effects, but not overdone. It has a 'District 9' Pedigree, so if you saw that little gem, you know what I'm talking about. It's a hard 'R' rating, and it revels in the violence, this isn't some soppy summer superhero special for the kiddies... Or at least it's only for those ready to graduate to something a little stronger, if you know what I mean.I liked that it was just another ordinary day in the life of Dredd, but for us fans, it was an epic day because it was Anderson's rookie test - nice work from writer Alex Garland! Lots of sweet little Easter Eggs like that in the film to really make it shine for a fan.Like all good comic book heroes, Dredd is simple on one level: he is the law. He's an unstoppable force, he never waivers and he never fails. But he's complex because in one story he is the hero who saves the day, in another he is an extremely mean cop and pretty much the villain. This picture gets the tone dead right and makes great choices throughout. It's lean and mean and exceedingly bad-ass!!!",Dredd
499,Tott_donetta,Spot on,10,20 May 2020,"I started reading 2000AD and Judge Dredd 30 years ago. I always thought it would be pretty much impossible to film properly and the earlier Stallone movie confirmed that for me - I didn't think it was completely terrible but it didn't feel like Dredd.
This movie however gets it right, not 100% comic book accurate but it gets it right. it keeps the important parts of Dredd's world and the unimportant parts it bleeds into modern day culture in a way that makes even a world as fantastic as Dredd's seem very real and probable. the story, limited to one mega bloc, was definitely the right way to go and focussing on just the 2 main characters rather than forcing cameo's from all the thousands of Judges and supporting characters that have appeared over 4 decades of comic books was again a very wise decision.
The 3 lead actors are all excellent, they play their parts exceptionally well and special kudos to a 100% perfect Karl Urban. Fingers crossed we'll see Urban under the helmet again.
Taken as a movie in its own right, I think it's a decent bit of sci-fi, ordinarily I'd give it an 8 or a 9, but as a life long Dredd fan finally seeing a true Judge Dredd movie on the screen I have to bump it up to a 10.",Dredd
500,propeller-92481,"Yes Sir, this is Dredd!",8,30 June 2021,"This movie totally nails the Brit-comic superhero in every aspect. The plot is gorgeous, ultra dystopian and very much along the line of the comic series. The slow-mo effects give another dimension the action sequences, but gets a bit repetitive in the end and Urban's acting leaves nothing to be missed! The man is truly Dredd and you can clearly see Carlo Ezquerra's graphic representation of Dredd in Urban's lower face! The scenery and props are all well made, not entirely faithful to the comic (the lawgiver - gun and lawmaster - bike are not comic based designs), but instead some tasteful visual interpretation that does not disappoint.Also Olivia Thirlby does terrific job as Judge Andersson and the chemistry between her and Dredd builds a strong base for the movie. To top it all, Lana Headey plays a wonderful villain and her acting brings true dimension to her role.The ending of the movie does not come in line with the frenetic pace of the whole movie and the climax drops terribly in the last few minutes and leaves a lot to be desired.Overall it is a well researched and exceptionally well performed movie, it is faithful to the comic and fans of Judge Dredd will love it.

I like the world, gritty, dirty, tough. The two main actors do a very good job, in particular Olivia Thirlby (Judge Anderson) who is a mutant and a rookie judge going on her test day, pass or fail, with the experienced Judge Dredd. There is a lot of killing and violence so if you are not into that avoid this. Definitely an underrated title. They should do a follow up with Judge Anderson as the lead.",Dredd
503,andwhite1,Just Meh,3,13 March 2021,"Basically robocop without any of the social commentary subtext. Cops good. Drug lords bad. Cops kill every bad person like indestructible robot. I mean everything in mega city seems pretty awful and even Dredd admits they only respond to 6% of crime. This system seems not to work at all? I would need slo mo drugs too if I lived there! Perhaps they should explore legalization and use the taxes for more social programs? I mean if you take any subtext from this it shows the futility of ultra militaristic policing. Yay the judges and drug gangs killed 100s of innocent and guilty people in one typical day. I mean considering ma ma's background clearly mega city broke her and Dredd. There is a yin and yang there that isn't really explored. I assume maybe it is in the comics. It is just a 13 year olds wet dream video game violence fantasy. If you just take it as such it us fine which many of these reviews reflect. But I feel a missed opportunity to say more here and the movie returns seem to agree. The Matrix, John Wick, The Raid, even the original Robocop are prob better choices here. If you want to watch an extended video game cutscene it fits the bill. Prob needs to be a streaming series more thean a movie franchise.",Dredd
504,Jon_Mathias,At Last! An Action Film for Grown-ups.,9,15 September 2012,"Like many fans of Judge Dredd, the abysmal 1995 Stallone offering had left me resigned to never seeing the Mega City lawman on the big screen again so Pete Travis's film is most welcome.$45m for a sci-fi actioner is peanuts these days but Travis has got real value for money and all the cash is right up there on the screen. The film has a gritty, urban feel and is much more contemporary than the 2000AD comics strip but that actually fits much better with the film's overall aesthetics. The vehicles are also 20th century, as are most of the firearms.The cast are universally excellent; Urban does a brilliant job, especially so given the confines of the helmet. Thirlby gives a striking and understated performance as Judge Anderson, although I felt that Ma-Ma could have been fleshed out better.The violence is brutal, explicit, realistic and beautifully choreographed. Forget the recent fad for the hero to fly 100 metres through the air in CGI somersaults, firing 2 pistols with unerring accuracy as the bad guys somehow miss with every shot; gunfights are brutal, with bloody consequences.The sound and cinematography deserve special mention. Sound has been used particularly effectively to create mood, from the zooming slowdown to indicate the effects of slo-mo to the manipulation of bass to indicate menace. The cinematography is excellent; again, the over-saturation of colour to indicate drug-induced heightened reality to the startling and seductive 3D effects on water drops or glass particles. I've never been a fan of 3D; there was a trailer for the latest Resident Evil offering before Dredd and I struggled to make out what was going on because EVERY shot was in 3D. The makers of Dredd understand that it needs to be used selectively and I might just be converted...So, overall an excellent, well-crafted film. It drops a point for the pedestrian plot but I'm being really picky here.",Dredd

Powerful, over the top characters, a hopeless vision of the future, dream like visuals mixed up with spilt blood all over the place. I love this film so much because reminded of the cheap (but breave) 80s sci fi filims. The argument is quite straightforward: a good cop and his new psiquick team mate have to escape from a mega city complex to take out an important suspect, and between then and the walls all kind of bad things happens and blood starts to spread like butter (literally). If you like old good sfi fi films like Escape from LA, Terminator and so on, then I am sure you will enjoy this film so much as I did.",Dredd

507,jamierulz98,Loved it!!,10,6 January 2013,"This film right here is one hell of a good action movie. I loved the intensity, the action, the acting and everything about it. Judge Dredd was serious, tough, superior and one man you do NOT want to mess with. I also like the fact that this isn't a movie that's got alien ships ,ufo's, weird looking freakish monsters and all that other stuff you would normally see in a Sc-Fi movie. This is a movie has gangs, corruption, narcotics, the buildings are all dusty and broken and it's as if it was a ghost town and those type of elements give this Sc-Fi movie a much more deeper, darker feel to it. This is one hell of a good remake since the 1995 version which stared Stallone considering Stallone didn't do his best performance. This is movie is jam packed with Guns,explosions,blood splatters and everything else that makes a great action movie. Defiantly a 10/10",Dredd
508,Clyph10,Dredd review,8,10 September 2013,"Honestly, when I first saw the trailer, I thought this film would be a complete flop. But to my surprise, it was quite entertaining and well made. This remake of the classic follows Judge Dredd on a homicide call taken place with one of the most residential buildings, the Peaches Hotel. By his side is first time rookie Anderson, who is a mutant and has psychic abilities (reads peoples thoughts, memories and senses others' presence). Now I could understand why some would get angry at how she has these abilities to help her but it didn't bug me, for it is the future. What they uncover is that they're about to endure the craziest drug bust of their lives. The drug lord, Mama, sends her minions after the 2 as they make their way all the way up on level 200, where she's hiding. Mama is the kingpin of the newly distributed Slow Mo drug, which makes reality seem slower. The gun fights in the movie are pretty wild, especially when the gangs are under the Slow Mo effects. Overall, this movie had good action and effects throughout, with a decent cast and plot to the side. Compared to the original, this new film focuses more on the action and situation, while the original is more in depth with Dredd himself. This movie surprised me, as its a blend of the original and new elements. 2.5*/4",Dredd
509,DerKill,Entertaining and Mature Action,8,25 September 2013,"Dredd is one of the more brutal and violent action movies that I have seen in a while. Most of it takes place in a single tower-block, which is a futuristic skyscraper that houses tens of thousands of people. Judge Dredd is locked in and has to fight his way to the top. It sounds dull, but the scenes are well done and the movie flows nicely.Judge Dredd's character was modeled after Dirty Harry and it shows with his raspy voice, dislike of most individuals, and general unhappiness. He is even partnered with a rookie who may or may not make it through the day. But unlike Dirty Harry, it's perfectly legal when Judge Dredd effectuates summary justice. And yes, there are some cold-blooded executions. Speaking of killing, there is a whole lot it. And for a movie that is subtly cartoonish, the action has a sober tone that I didn't expect. It's a welcome change from the typical action movie and I loved it.",Dredd
510,CrazyBomber,Great action movie,8,2 October 2012,"Absolutely enjoyed every moment of this movie. For what it is, and comparing to others in the same genre, I'd say it's a pretty good movie.Great actors, a story that took longer than 5 seconds to write, some gore, some good characters, and plenty of action. In short, a damn good action movie.On the not so good side, it was a little short on character development. Not having read the comics, I would really like to know more about Dredd, for instance. It also seemed a bit repetitive, since all the action took place in the same building.Even so, I still enjoyed it a lot. Too bad it's not making back it's investment. I was really looking forward to a sequel (fingers crossed).",Dredd
511,sergio-arauzo,Much better than 1995 film,7,5 September 2014,"When I approached this film a was not very optimistic about it, just because of the awful 1995 version. Stallone film was so weak that I was discouraged about what Hollywood could have done this time. But I was surprised, because this movie is really good and shares only the name with that 1995 horror. It will please Dredd fans but also anyone who like a good action film. Very solid story, with no major holes, good performances of the main characters, excellent combat scenes and some unexpected surprises. Karl Urban is a very solid Dredd, fitting perfectly in the skin of the comic character. Olivia thirtly looks great in her judge clothes and fits very well in their role. A must see for every Dredd fan and every action movie lover.",Dredd
512,kmtwalsh,Karl Urban as the new and improved Judge Dredd,10,22 July 2016,"I happened to be one of the only ones to have enjoyed the first film that featured Dredd starring Sylvester Stallone, it was fun and very cartoony so I was interested to see what the new adaptation starring Karl Urban would be like.The story starts with Dredd having to take a rookie out for an evaluation to see if she is ready for the role of a Judge. Anderson, the rookie is a powerful psychic who has failed the tests. They are called to a murder scene where three drug dealers have been skinned alive in a tower block. Through Anderson's powers they arrest the culprit and are about to take him to jail when his boss, Ma Ma seals the tower and calls for the residents to kill the Judges so begins a fight for survival.I thought Karl Urban was brilliant as Dredd, It is a very hard role to play as his face is hidden by a helmet for the whole of the film so he uses his body and voice Very effectively and is a commanding presence . Olivia Thirlby as Anderson was just as good and I felt she and Urban worked well together. Lena Headey is another standout performance as the villain Ma Ma.What I enjoyed most about the film was the claustrophobic element as the film takes place in one setting, the tower block and it was gripping throughout especially when they are in danger and in situations where it appears there's no escape.The special affects are amazing particularly the scenes where the audience essentially goes into Anderson's head and we see her visions.I think it is definitely better than the Sylvester Dredd film which I still like but this film works out the problems that were picked up in the first film and irons them out to make it a far more believable film.",Dredd
513,MrChekov,Great Action Movie,9,6 March 2021,"Action all the way. Movie scripts often include ridiculous or implausible twists in the plot. Not so with this movie. Well executed from beginning to end. NO SHAKE CAM! Dimmed lighting wasn't over-used. Annoying music was kept to a minimum.

514,gary-30958,This is Dredd,10,10 July 2016,"I wasn't expecting much out this after Sylvester Stallone's atrocious outing but I thought I'd give it a go.The start wasn't that impressive, just your typical gun and chase scene and Karl Urban as Dredd just looked a little emaciated for my impression of Dredd but the chin looked good and the uniforms were dirty and obviously things were pretty bad in mega-city. I was also impressed with the bikes which at least had a passing resemblance to those in the comic books so at least there is some effort.And then we are introduced to Cassandra Anderson played perfectly by Olivia Thirby. Knowing the history of Dredd and Anderson this ended up being a nice introduction into how they met.The main thrust of the story is that of a locked down mega block where it's just Anderson and Dredd going against the bad guys. It is your pretty formulaic computer game in a movie, you have the canon fodder then the end of level bosses but it is handled beautifully with amazing visuals and a wonderful sound track. This movie is for the Dredd fans. Karl Urban and Olivia Thirby play their roles perfectly. Anderson and Dredd are brought to life in this movie.More please!!",Dredd

I am no comic book fan but I can imagine the darker side of things portrayed in the film would have stayed truer to the comic than perhaps many previous comic book outings eg. batman, hulk, iron-man etc.Extremely violent, well shot, atmospheric, and a fitting sound-track just about sum this 90 min movie up. At best it is an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half of your life - providing you're not looking for anything too substantial by way of plot or characters. At worst this is mindless violence masquerading as something more cool.5 out of 10 is very fair I think.",Dredd
521,Krapnov,As long as you know what your getting into...,7,1 October 2012,"I'll say it right off the bat, this is not a movie for everyone ; I went to see it with my girlfriend (she expected to hate it even before we set foot in the cinema and she was not disappointed in that regard) but we had an interesting argument about it afterward.I'll admit the movie has it's flaws ; The boldly advertised '3D ' is more a marketing statement than a real thing and manage to be somewhat annoying at time. Mostly some seemingly random items are brought to foreground while the action continue unabated. With the exception of a few scenes (the perspective view of characters under the influence of SLO-MO for instance) I would have been happier with the 2$ supplement '3D' cost safely tucked in my pocket.Over-the-top CGI animated blood splatter deserve a mention as another mild irritant ; Nothing beats the old' fashionned 'exploding-blood-pocket' special effects in my book.Also, even with the impressive budget allowed to produce such a venture, some visual elements, makeup and costumes manage to look cheap and cheesy.The cast is mostly appropriate though the mandatory villains lack in the personality & style department (Lena Headey which I usually find pretty good is surprisingly forgettable in this one).As for the storyline... Well let's just say it's pretty straightforward, no subleties there. This is not a bad thing in itself as this is an action movie but those who do not have any previous knowledge of just who or what Judge Dredd is will find the narrated voice-over (at the beginning) a pretty thin setting for the remaining 90 minutes the movie last.Yet even so,I was happy with what was presented here ; There was (almost) no half-baked attempt to humanize the heroes nor any of the out-of-place romances between characters which usually plague such blockbusters.Overall it manage to be entertaining, keep a serious tone without being pretentious and it deliver what it promises ; A 'no-brainer-action-packed-blood-fueled-straightforward-sci-fi' movie.",Dredd

There was no plot, no character development and terrible production values. The movie was so horrific at times I could not stop laughing. I don't understand how anyone can take this movie seriously. It has a lot of action, but it is extremely generic and forgettable. It felt like I was watching a C-level video game. I am still just amazed that people enjoyed this movie. There were some cool 3-D effects, however these effects alone are not enough to save the move.

523,andres_gar876,The funniest action film I've watched in a while.,8,28 November 2015,"I'll start by saying, to me this was a great movie, not because of the story, the acting, effects nor anything else like that. It's great because it made me laugh a lot.First of all, they don't really give a good explanation of what's going on in that futuristic sci-fi world. They give a very small intro with Judge Dredd explaining the world situation and chasing down bad guys. But I guess that's what they wanted to do, like an old school action film.What I found extremely funny in this movie is, one, that Dredd is always making an angry face. Two, that the other main character who had ""psychic powers"" for some non explained reason; she says things that don't really get an explanation, like what she sees in Dredd.Also, the dialogs and acting during all the movie that tries to be serious is simply hilarious and funny because of the angry face of Dredd, and because most of the bad characters seem to be high or not taking things seriously, that's also very funny.In conclusion, I found it to be a great comedy film. Don't take the movie seriously if you're gonna watch it.",Dredd
524,macca197338,A satisfied fan of the comic.,10,31 January 2013,"I prefer reading the non-professional critical reviews on IMDb as they deliver a far more balanced and realistic view of a film than the self-proclaimed artistic minders who pontificate in the press, looking for the next Academy award winning movie.Dredd is one such film which I feel has had an unjustified hard time. The critics have missed the point, this movie is an excellent representation of the comic strip and will be appreciated by the fans while not making any friends at the Academy.As a 2000AD fan, I watched with much derision the Stallone version. To give that movie's art department its due, it had studied the comic books and gave a visually stunning movie, it was just a shame the writers and the actors had not done the same and left me extremely disappointed.This version however ticks all the boxes. It provided a believable setting for a near future hell, while providing enough similarities to the comic to remain faithful to its origins. Dredd was portrayed brilliantly by Urban – the helmet remained on and there was no tinkering with the character. Dredd has no learning curve, he has no emotional outlet and he has no self-doubt but at the same time there were elements that displayed that he was human, albeit in the form of acerbic one word comments or dismay at the ""overkill"" of his adversary.Given his single minded determination and limited character development potential, he had the perfect foils for this in both his partner Anderson and the real psycho bad-gal Ma Ma. Olivia Thirlby and Lena Headey both turned in quality solid performances and gave the film the necessary variation in theme required and the story more layers than most ""shoot-em up"" movies.The violence was graphic, appealing to the gore fest fans and precluding me from letting my 12 year watch it and to some degree must have pushed the movie away from some of its core audience, unless 2000AD market is now middle age comic readers who fail to grow up – such as me.So I really enjoyed it and hope that it performs well enough to justify a sequel. It runs quickly, provides tension and does not require you to think much unless you want to, in which case there is something there for you to ponder. It is a superior action flick, giving you a healthy dose of dark realism whilst letting you escape for a couple of hours your own world and making you appreciate it more when you get back to it.",Dredd
525,watch_or_not,KARL URBAN IS DREDD,10,15 July 2018,"This is what the real Judge Dredd should look like on screen. Fantastic visuals and aggressive violence are pieced together perfectly from a script by Alex Garland. Every scene was executed brilliantly with a camera being designed with the specific purpose of showing the audience something we had never seen before, when the effects of the drug ""Slo-Mo"" start to kick in, and it is hard to forget. 
 Karl Urban is Dredd, he brings the character to life straight from the pages of the comic and is what many fans have envisioned him to be. Unlike Stallone's ego driven 1995 version of himself, Urban embraces the legacy of the character, while letting his talent speak for itself. Dredd is a tortured and tormented individual who shows no remorse for criminals while remaining a symbol of hope for the rest of humanity. Dredd was the movie all fans were waiting for, and it did not disappoint. 
 Let's hope we can get a follow up of some sort in the near future either on the big or small screen.",Dredd

I feel bad that the movie did not do too well commercially , it should have considering it was far better than the original Silverster Stallone version . The inclusion of the psychic gave it a nice twist in my opinion . There are some parts in the story which the psychic gave reason to think. The action sequences were very well choreographed , specially the slo-mo ones . The light and colour saturation looked very nice.

It's straight in with the violent action and anybody unfamiliar with the character will pick it up soon enough. The film has none of the Hollywood sheen that ruined the first film and is closer to the darkest Dredd stories with only brief glimpses of humour. It works extremely well. The budget isn't huge and this helps add a grungy dark atmosphere to the film. 3D effects aren't overly intrusive and add some nice touches here and there. This is a tight and well made action film. I only hope it will be a box office hit and there will be sequels exploring Mega City One and other characters in the future.",Dredd

Dredd was affably grumpy and ruthless and the girl was charming and drew the right feelings and the evil villain was a total punk who you wouldn't want to meet in a small alley even though she is a attractive woman.the plot is fun, enough mood is set with the radioactive future megacity full of punks and innocents, and judges out on missions to terminate or capture any unruly punks. no need to dwell on plastic props, failed panoramic shots, in fact the only flaw of this film is that they didn't have enough money to give it truly mindblowing megacity megahighway radioactive world large scale shots for 20 seconds at the start. it's nice and the only thing i found broke the Dredd fanboy feel, whilst not being over demanding of them, is that i thought... that doesn't look THAT cool for a Dredd future world, when they zoomed in oin the magacity at the start. the rest of the film was the mind blowing.the drug is original, the deaths are creative and artistic, the guns are fun, the judge dredd is great, some shots are hd glittering slow motion capture of really pretty elements of nature splashing and flying, set in a background of gritty inner city mob rule and darkness and dust. 10/10 for mindless excellent 2 hours of fun, i enjoyed it as much as i enjoy the best films I've seen.",Dredd

532,clsrocks,Final Judgement: Close but no Cigar!!!!,6,26 September 2012,"Everyone was really excited about this flick.Even before the movie released it was getting awesome reviews from people who saw the previews.I guess I never realized there were so many 'Dredd Heads' out there being a big comic book fan myself!So yes when it came out there was universal acclaim for this movie. I was still skeptical, wanted to wait for the reviews.Then I saw the IMDb rating of 7.9 and was thrilled.This movie would rock.I generally get excited when comic book movies are liked among the movie community as well.It mostly means we get a 'Kick-ass' movie adaptation. Having said that, when I finally saw the end product it wasn't as great. The basic trouble I had with the movie was the pacing. The actions scenes are all shot in 'Slo-mo'(also the name of the drug they used in the movie) kinda takes the energy away from a high octane action.Also,after 10 minutes into the film you want stuff to blow up ,Dredd to get beaten..,awesome dialogues..one liners. However, it never happens.Instead, we get a Robocop video game of the 90's where a guy goes and shoots up stuff kills lots of people in the process gets hurt once and staples his gun-shot wound and in the end throws the bad-guy (in this case girl) from the roof in the so called final level.Predictable you say? I knew this story line even before I saw the trailers. So yeah no awesome script. Then we rely on the action to save the movie.But yeah its a let down there also.There is no stylized gun- battles etc.Pretty straight forward...I shoot..you die...I scream 'I am the law!' in the middle.There is no intensity at all.Its a big drag.I want to address some other points as well. One being the unanimous hatred against the 'Stallone' movie.This movie thrives on the fact that the last movie was very bad and this was a bit better.That does not mean its the best movie ever.Just a bit more serious and more true to the comic. Well the Stallone movie was something I had enjoyed as a child. It was fast paced and entertaining! So what if he removes his helmet? We all knew what Stallone looked like anyway! Also I don't have much trouble with Rob S at least he gives us some comic relief.Unlike the zero humor in the new movie.Yeah I know I am the only person in the world probably whose defending the old film.But I did like his old gun better.More solid much bigger more believable to store all those gizmos. Yes Judge Rico was bad ass! Hershey was a good character thanks to Diane Lane.Also, loved the Robot and the Steel handed man he battles towards the end.Stallone did a decent job for me and the movie was not as bad as people say. Secondly,the movie has been compared to 'The Raid' movie. Oh come on, there was a movie called 'Die hard' a few years back in which one guy fights all bad guys in a building he's trapped in.So yeah, the concept ain't freaking new if you know what I mean! Finally, what worked me in this movie was a brilliant actor named 'Karl Urban'.He takes on the role of Dredd in such an awesome manner.They are considering him for the next 'Batman' as well. Everything he does works from 'Riddick' to 'Doom' to 'Pathfinder'! Lena Heady is a good actress but she's wasted in this movie.They don't make use of her acting talent at all.So if your gonna go see 'Dredd' go see it for Urban. Don't expect anything much from the movie. Its a slow motion action drama. 'District 9' the director's previous movie was so much better than this.Go see that anyday!",Dredd

534,liluh-237-727727,"Dredd, thumbs up!",8,4 April 2013,"First of I would like to say that my romance with Judge Dredd as a comic hero was rather slim and narrowed to a couple of special edition comic books released around the same time that the Sly's version of the movie came out (1995). There were simply no other releases back then in my country. Either way, the few I read made a strong impression on me. The more awkward it felt, when I then turned my attention to the movie. Sly seemed to be rightfully angry all the time, but the whole picture was far too candy-like and colorful compared to the grim and dirty comic series.This time, we have Karl Urban and oh my, the angel of vengeance he is. He plays Dredd, the merciless judge that executes law in the post apocalyptic Mega City One, the remnants of the old USA after a nuclear war. Judges are few, but they make up for the lack of numbers with their utmost training, skills and commitment of eradicating all crime. They are the police, the jury and executioners. And Dredd is a legend among them. This time, he ends up with a rookie (Anderson - played rather bluntly at times by Olivia Thirlby), who he has to see through one final test. Is she passes, she will join the force. If not, well, most likely she will end up dead. The duo ventures into a mega-block residential structure called ""Peach Trees"" to investigate a triple homicide, but a simple case quickly turns into nasty meat grinder without a way out.We have lots of shooting, lots of explosions, and - which is true to the source material - lots of blood and carnage. Often served as a sort of black humor. There are twists and turns, and little details that will make the fans smile. Everything mixed in just about right proportions. The story is well paced and the camera work shows exactly what we need to see, limiting the 'gore' factor to the necessary minimum.I would also like to praise Lena Headey (who is probably most known for her role in the Games of the Thrones TV series) playing psychotic character of Ma-Ma, the main villain. To summary. This is a movie of 3 actors, nice visuals and lots of action. If you are looking for some not very demanding fun, this is it, and you will be satisfied. It's nothing else, and doesn't try to be. It surely stands above similar flicks like (wannabe) ambitious Priest, or (yikes) bigger budget block busters like Battleships. In its role, I give it a solid 8/10. And to think this had only half of the budget that old ""Judge Dredd"" movie had ($35ml to $70ml). Well done.",Dredd
535,JimmyMcCool,The Judge is back.,8,16 November 2014,"It's the future after Armageddon, and one place still stands, Mega City One, surrounded by a radio active wasteland called the Cursed Earth.Judge Dredd is from one of Britain's most popular comics. A policeman of the future that is a walking embodiment of the state: judge, jury, executioner, policeman and soldier. He's packing a gun that fires six types of ammo (incendiary, hi ex, armour piercing, phosphorous and probably more). He is fairly mysterious,we don't learn much about him. The story has pace and gets a move on and Dredd is arresting and executing perps as he should be.The bad chick is called Mama and she's bad, man. She's peddling a drug called slo-mo, her gang committed some murders, then Dredd and his psychic rookie Anderson (on assessment to become a Judge) follow the trail until they end up in the middle of her operation.For the fans, there's a lot of easter eggs. The poster of Krysler's mark – only a true Dredd geek would understand that one.For action fans, the action is cold and brutal. Anderson reluctantly executed someone and bumped into the wife later. Dredd gassed perps on the stairs and executed them while they were coughing. People get their heads blown off, shot in the back, flash banged - that's the thing about Dredd, he's the thinking man's action hero, he always has an advantage or outplays his opponents. Arguably his best move was when he pulled that cliché.One last thing is the fantastic original soundtrack.A Trojan horse of an indie movie amongst block busters that was intended to pave the way for sequels. Made for the comic fans and action fans. Alas, due to the films poor box office there may never an another movie about Judge Dredd.",Dredd

However when I took the opportunity to watch it to actually see how bad it was I was amazed at how opposite it was from my original ideas about it. This version blows Stallone's out of the water as well as most of the other recent additions to the dystopian future category. Dredd gives a gritty and raw updated interpretation of the comics all while staying true to the source material. If you have not seen it it is definitely worth the watch. In addition as of February 25 Karl Urban announced at a Star Trek event that there has been talk of a possible sequel. This was originally thought to be out of the question when the 50 million dollar budgeted movie only grossed 35 million world wide, but due to the massive number of home copies purchased it has reentered the realm of possibility. I personally hope to see this franchise take off and show the other franchises like hunger games and harry potter what a real movie is.",Dredd
537,keremgo,For Karl Urban and Olivia Thirlby...,4,23 July 2013,"I've seen this Dredd 2012 on TV. Watched it just because I really like Karl Urban and Olivia Thirlby. Never been a fan of Dredd character. Didn't liked the Stallone version either.And in this 2012 remake, something was missing on the movie - can't really tell what is was. It was somehow weak, lack of passion. I'm hoping they produce a better remake, probably a sequel with the same cast because cast was SO good! And unfortunately they couldn't put their best because of the weak production quality.I'm looking forward to see a powerful, deep and successful remake like Total Recall.",Dredd
538,michael-burnard,Satisfyingly Exciting and Excitingly Satisfying,9,22 March 2014,"This is honestly some of the most fun I've had in a while. A sci-fi action movie, Dredd plays like some insane screenwriter decided it would be a good idea to mash up Die Hard and Robocop. Starring Karl Urban as the titular super-cop, it has stunning action scenes and some of the best-filmed gun battles since The Matrix. The story is about the two Street Judges Dredd and Anderson, as they are locked in an apartment complex and forced to battle wave after wave of gun-wielding criminals. There's some great integration of story and visuals in this movie, and they even went so far as to explain the reason that slow-motion scenes are in slow-motion. There's quite a bit of gore too, with people being shot, crushed, thrown off ledges, burned by flares and even skinned alive. It's all shot in this very in-your-face way, which is pretty bro-tastic. Overall, this movie is a solid place in my favourite action films of all time, and I highly recommend it.",Dredd
539,HOWLING_MAD_DOC,Nowhere near as good as 1995 Judge Dredd,7,15 October 2013,"First off let me state I am a HUGE fan of Karl Urban as Dr. Leonard H. McCoy of the Star Trek reboot. I think he got the feel, intonation and mannerisms of DeForest Kelley's Dr. McCoy right on the money.Although, as Judge Dredd I think Urban blew it. That is not to say that Sly Stallone's movie was perfect. It most definitely could have done without Rob Schneider! I think Stallone was more in tune with the Dredd of comic book fame. He had the kick butt attitude and mannerisms,to use a British phrase, Spot On, and who doesn't love Armand Assante as a villain. He does it so well.Gotta love the Judge uniforms in both movies, but I think Sly's is more impressive over Urban's. Not to mention the weapons and other great toys. I do prefer the 1995 Dredd Lawmaster Cycle to the Karl Urban bike.Enough for now.

To me, the whole thing plays out like a film made by a nerdy student who's been let loose with too much of a franchise than he/she knows what to do with. I mean, seriously.....Dredd and his partner having to make it out of a building alive. Is that the BEST story they could come up with???? Maybe because that kept the movie under budget? I know, lets reinvent Robocop and have the whole movie set in a factory. Which is probably what the knobheads will do anyway!

I guess if I was a fan of the comic book I might have appreciated it more, but just the movie alone is not worth watching. It's very similar to Raid: Redemption and even though Raid is not that great of a movie either, its quite a bit better than this.

549,AsgerHa,"Good entertainment, but lacking in contrasts",1,4 October 2012,"The new Dredd movie from 2012 is good, solid entertainment. The story is mostly a case study of Dredd and rookie Judge Anderson (a quite important figure in the comics it is nice to see her included in the adaption) working a single case. The result of this focus is a well rounded and satisfying story which looks a lot like a ""pilot episode"" with the extra quality of being able to stand alone (rather than just introducing characters and suggesting future plot lines without actually telling a story).But it fails in capturing the ""feel"" of the comic books. Without meaning this in a strictly purist way, I still think the one quality that would really make a Dredd movie stand out - and above - from the majority of superhero movies ... would be to do a good job of capturing the characteristics that makes the comic book a success - in a way that clearly stands apart from anything else.The new ""Dredd"" fails to do so for a number of reasons. While more popular than the 1995 ""Judge Dredd"" with Sylvester Stallone, that version remains an arguably better interpretation of the comic books in a number of ways.Overall, the Stallone version had two flaws. First and foremost: Judge Dredd takes off his helmet. This rightly put off a lot of fans - he NEVER does that in the comics. It *is* an error, huge enough in itself to say the Stallone adaption fails to be a ""true"" Judge Dredd adaption. Secondly, it actually tried too hard to be a loyal adaption of the comic book in other respects, e.g. by including a robot from the marginal ABC Warriors from the books - and many other ""well known details"". It's more a showcase than good story telling.But this also makes the Stallone movie more colorful, absurd, and over-the-top in a way that - despite the helmet issue - does a vastly better job at capturing several important qualities that make the books stand apart.The new ""Dredd"" does a better job at telling a story - but it fails completely in being ""real"" Dredd. ""Judge Dredd"" surely wasn't perfect - but neither is ""Dredd"". It lacks in the extreme contrasts that hallmark the Dredd comic books.The comic books have a lot of special traits that makes them great fun; more absurd British humor than the new movie succeeds in capturing. This *is* a loss because a more loyal adaption would have been more unique, better-looking and overall funnier than the entertaining but far from unique result at hand.For example: Judge Dredd is NOT a ""future cop"", he is a ""judge"". All judges are brainwashed with principles of justice to a degree where they are more ""robocops"" than human beings. There are no corrupt judges. And they do not ""uphold the law"": Their mandate is to *make* the law - on the spot, for the occasion.Megacity One is *not* a gigantic slum. It is a clean and colorful city of enormous buildings in absurd designs. There are no 1, 2, or 3 story buildings, there simply isn't room for that. The huge population *must* be packed into gigantic beehive buildings. The air traffic is of course TIGHT.Megacity One is held in an iron grip by the Department of Justice - the Judges. They are *NOT* - quote - ""losing control of the city"" - they constantly have to fight extreme crime and disturbances in an extremely large population, but ... ""losing control""? ... The Judges? -NEVER! Dredd of the comic books is first and foremost fun because he is the ultimate parody of the ultimate control freak.Much of the problem here would be the lack of money to (re-)create a convincingly correct Judge Dredd universe. In order to cover this a bit the movie mostly takes place in darkly lit corridors.But thus is lost the contrast between an amusement park-like colorful city, and dark and absurd violence, and extreme measures of justice, of the comic book, which combine into a unique world of absurd contrasts in the comics. The less visible but extremely important point that the Judge Dredd is a true hero and a true anti-hero both in one bag is also lost. The new ""Dredd"" seems too serious to fully capture that.The lesson from this movie is; if you cannot get the money for a real adaptation, do something else. A completely new version with a much bigger budget is our only hope for ever seeing a ""real"" Dredd adaptation.As a dark, gritty, violent low-budget action sci-fi this movie is a 6 out of 10. But for posturing as a ""Dredd"" movie without capturing anything of the look, feel, humour, or points of the source material, it ends up a 1.",Dredd
550,cm_fox,Very good movie but skip 3D though,7,19 October 2012,"I saw this movie the day it opened in regular 2D and really enjoyed it, especially the special effects, lighting, costumes, etc. There are some great scenes and its a well made movie. Definitely worth seeing if you enjoy good sci-fi.After a couple of weeks I wanted to go see it again. It's one of those movies worth seeing a 2nd time. I don't do this often so that tells you what I thought of this movie.I thought about seeing it in 3D this time. Checked the reviews, 3D sounded worth it (its not always). Boy was it not. After ten minutes I went and asked the manager if there was something wrong with the projector or my glasses. After her checking out the movie and calling the projectionist they confirmed what I saw: this movie is simply better in 2D than 3D. We all agreed the 3D version has many blurry scenes, especially the close-ups.The 3D version is hazy, not clear (close-ups). In fact, it loses the dark and brutal feel it had in 2D. Scenes that should be better in 3D are worse than 2D. There are scenes with smoke and water droplets that are hazy in the 3D version when they should be jumping out of the screen. The 3D version seems budget to me and overall it brought down the movie. I gave up in the end and walked away from the movie... I didn't want this poor 3D experience ruining my overall Dredd enjoyment.My recommendation is to see it in 2D only.",Dredd
551,metalunar,Rare company,9,20 December 2012,"Near Perfect.

There are few high water marks within the Genre of S.F. Forbidden Planet, Caltiki, It the terror from beyond space, Aliens, Bladerunner before Ripley destroyed it in his Director's Cut , and Avatar, and then crossing over to Animation of visual novels-Sin City, Watchmen,and very little else -the first Matrix film.Pitch Black. Pieces of Babylon A.D., Avalon, Demonlover. Tough sledding post the recent gun violence and I would give up all of it in a brainwipe if I could bring the dead back to life. This was near perfect. The Blackmass Casting of Sarah Connor as a more efficient killer was the stuff of Jim Thompson or Don Winslow. Great sets , plot development a bit linear -get David Fincher next time and you will go to 10 or beyond.A major cliff hanger-no Real reading by Anderson of Dredd at the end. But It Dovetails perfectly with his giving her an unknown or unwanted pass. Surprisingly good music. Gary Numan, Tangerine Dream vibes.It isn't The Wages of Fear or La Strada or Nights in Cambria if you wan't your inhumanity straight with no chaser, but hey we just retired Clint Eastwood for a man with mirrorshades beyond Cool Hand Luke.

552,dorshez,Great film for the non-hardcore (SPOILER ALERT),8,2 October 2012,"If you're one of these fans who insists that a film stick entirely to a comic, then you may not enjoy this, quite like a Batman fan refuses to watch Dark Knight because Joker doesn't fall into a vat of acid.But if you want a nice simple action fest with a cool comic book character then this film is great. And filmed beautifully on a tight budget of just $45m.Firstly, Karl Urban plays a mean, moody, unforgiving Dredd, just as he was in the comics. The helmet looks so much better than Stallones, and as promised, not once do we see his face. His uniform, though not true to the comics, looks better in a real life situation; instead of Lycra with a couple of shoulder pads, this guy wears full body armour, but still sticks to the green boots and gloves. His lawgiver looks quite small for a gun that packs such a punch, this may be the only real flaw to him. His voice, loses itself from time to time, ranging from clean when speaking loudly, to reverting back to it's raspy lost-my-voice mode when speaking in lower tones and delivering a beautifully portrayed ""I am the law"" line.Olivia is great as Judge Anderson on her first day, who begins a little like Hermione Granger, a know it all, but due to her experience on her first day, becomes hardened, and learns to judge more on a situation and emotional level than by the book, which strangely, Dredd approves of. This may be one of the few flaws of the film.The city itself, a little untrue to the comics in the sense of claustrophobia. Instead of Massive towers all piled next to each other, there are only a few, and far between. This was supposedly for an audience to get a feel for the size of the Mega Blocks, where the vast majority of the film takes place. Inside the block, the scenery becomes repetitive and boring, but suits the dark mood of the film.As does the black humour and violence. This is certainly not a film to watch if you're squeamish. The gore is not concentrated on unless it involves the main characters. The SLO-MO effect was not over used but the badly done 3D took away from it, and I much look forward to seeing it again without the 3D.All in all, without nit picking, this was a good film for those who don't want to be mind boggled and don't want a film that sticks so close to the comics, it's laid back, it's gruesome, it's fun, and it works. 7 out of 10 from me.",Dredd
553,Vec-911,Needs a sequel!!!,10,3 July 2020,"Dredd is an amazing adaptation of the comic books.
I've rated this movie a 10 back even I first seen it.
I bought the Dvd and now the BlueRay.Karl Urban plays the Role of Dredd and he's not disappointing, tough boots to fill and I felt he was born to play this character and I'm desperate for a sequel.
Olivia and Lena equally played their roles to perfection.
I was immersed in Mega City for the duration of the movie and didn't want it to end.
I'm sure Dredd fans loved this movie Just as I did and it's such a shame it wasn't marketed as much as it should've been.
It deserves a sequel with Karl Urban reprising his role as the Judge.
Please make this happen!",Dredd
554,pgreen-imdb,Good...But a stolen script!,7,20 December 2012,"A vast improvement on Stallone's version, very gritty and bloody with nice effects But my problem with it is that I had already seen the exact same movie (without Dredd) in ""The Raid:Redemption"" Perhaps if I hadn't seen The Raid I too would be raving about how good this film was, but sadly for me all the way through I was thinking to myself that this was a blatant rip-off.I hoped when I checked on IMDb I would see Gareth Evens credited with the story, but sadly nope, if I were him I'd be taking legal action for plagiarism against John Wagner and Carlos Esquerra.That aside though, the transfer from a small group of cops in a Indonesian tower block, to Dredd and top totty sidekick in a slightly futuristic tower block works well and I guess if reading subtitles is too much for you and you haven't seen The Raid then you will enjoy this movie.",Dredd
555,JSilk1993,My Review - Dredd 3D,7,4 October 2012,"Normally I'm quite harsh when it comes to low budget action films as they've let me down in the past but Dredd 3D surprised me and quite a few others from the sounds of it.Firstly, I liked Dredd 3D - a lot actually. Usually I'm someone who sees a film with a low budget and small setting that invokes a use of 3D and CGI blood then claims to be ""gritty"" when in actuality it's more like the cut-scene from a video game (not to name and blame; ""Resident Evil: Retribution""). However Dredd 3D took me by surprise the moment I saw bullets passing through torsos in slow motion. Dredd himself comes across as more of a symbol than anything due to Karl Urban's to-the-book portrayal of Dredd (from his grimace to his humour) and the inability to remove his helmet.The only gripe I really had with the film was its size. I cannot compare it to ""The Raid"" which I have yet to see but I can imagine I won't care about the similarities when I finally do. The film could have used a larger setting and, though the intro gives you an idea of how big Megacity 1 is - it's just a bit claustrophobic although the director uses this to his advantage with the action.Dredd 3D is bleak, bloody, bold and harsh, so leave the kids at home for this one. But when the combined elements of a solid story, very effective use of 3D and slow motion as well as a simple but solid storyline, the film will leave you hoping they will expand for a sequel and make the most of the budget like they did with this one.7/10",Dredd
556,eccooper,The Helmet stays on,9,5 October 2012,"Created in the 1970s on a diet of anti-heroes and Clint Eastwood's grizzled chin, Judge Joe Dredd patrols Mega City One dispensing justice as judge, jury and sometimes overly creative executioner. With the first film outing in 1995 an overstyled (to quote Clint from Heartbreak Ridge) 'clusterfuck'; this version had to distinguish itself from that Jean Paul Gaultier festival to hook back the fans.Urban, starring as the main man, managed to do this well before release with the reveal that Dredd does in fact keep his helmet on. In a society that seems to revel in what gets taken off it's refreshing to see art that values restraint, reserve and the beauty of understatement.This reserve does not extend to the violence. This is Mega City One as the spotty youth to which I belonged imagined it. It hurts the eye to watch the misery and cheap life flow through the cracks in the radiation-stained concrete one minute and experience the magical drug- filled bliss the next.Through this world of pitiful contradiction Dredd strides like a constant. The man's presence is such that as his dialogue becomes ever more truncated, his impact increases to the extent he can deliver one liners without a word.Alongside him is rookie judge Anderson (Thirlby): psychic and damaged, she is a perfect counterpoint for Dredd. With an earnest desire to 'make a difference' the struggle to reconcile her vision of justice with the absolutes of the world of 2000AD gives the film a depth that takes it beyond actioner and into social and moral commentary.With a plot centred on Anderson's first and possibly last day on the job, her character is set directly against the deliciously deviant Lena Hedley as drug lord Ma Ma. Almost a mirror to each other, both characters are scarred by the nightmare future and pushed either side of the law.Dredd occupies the centre: implacable, unreadable. Like Harry Callaghan before him, if we ever asked him why he did what he did, day after day, year after year, well, we'd never believe him if he told us.",Dredd
557,badwonder,"hard, bloody, real and beautiful in its sort of way",9,15 October 2012,"Dredd 3d is not a direct recreation of the series 2000 ad. but it's close, almost too close.it's a bloody mess it might actually make some people sick, other than that if you like action, this is your film. I admit I did not watch the film raid, some of the reviews says both films looks like each other, well, don't compare them. why? because this is dredd dammit! (not a fan boy)well where was I? ah yes dredd, why should anyone watch dredd? for 3 simple reasons.1. it's like an old messy bloody real action movie and it goes on in a post apocalyptic future.2. the way Karl urban looks in the helmet, it's dredd. it's really really dredd in flesh.3. the way the film begins and the way it ends. I'm not going to spoil anything, but if you watched the film, think, think of the beginning and think of the end. And think of what dredd tell about ma-ma. (this is not a spoiler is it?) If you are going to watch the film. pay attention to the start, pay attention to the first scene and then the last scene and what dredd say about ma-ma and you will understand what I'm talking about.and one last thing. the 3d (which I don't like in general by the way) was awesome. I liked it and it was superb. overall I still think this film deserves a 9, my friend who watched the film with me (yes I did force him to watch it.) said the film was good and he would give something between 7.7 and 8.Soo cheerio and if you read this with a little excitement and a little smirk go watch the film.",Dredd
558,jaya4185,One of the finest comic adaptations and potential cult classic,9,31 January 2013,"As a fan of Judge Dredd, and I've read some graphic novels and some of the case files (comic compilations), this is definitely a great adaption. This by all means is not a sequel to the Stallone version, and that's a very good thing. The visuals, action sequences, and faithfulness to the source material makes this not only my favorite comic book movie of the year, but one of the best adaptations of all time.The premise of the film is very simple. Set in mega city 1, the film just starts out as another day on the job. Judges are pretty much cops, and are the only thing enforcing the law. Than judge dredd has been assigned to test the new rookie judge Cassandra Anderson, who has telepathic abilities. They than find a triple homicide in peach trees on the lawmaster (motorcycle) , and discover the Ma Ma clan is the sole producer of the new drug slo mo. They go in to the place and capture Kay (Ms Ma clan member), a man partly responsible for the homicide. Than The Ma Ma clan puts the whole mega block on lock down. Than they pretty much raise hell going up 200 floors of the mega block and take down Ma Ma and her gang.Despite a simple synopsis, that is arguably one of the films strengths. Some people say this is a rip off of the raid, but this project started much earlier in 2008 (I like both movies). One thing i liked was, as previously stated, the faithfulness to the source material. Dredd never takes his helmet, and they never try to develop him too much. He is pretty much a 1 dimensional, emotionless enforcer of the law. Cassandra is the more emotional, developed character who balances the duo. The movie is straight to the point and simple, and that is not very common in movies anymore. Another thing i liked was that mega city feels like something that is possible.The action is intense, fast paced, and sometimes even beautiful (I'll get on why i say that). The Slo Mo sequences are visually stunning. It gives you a perspective of being on the drug, and the colors are vivid. The water looks like diamonds, and the blood flows like ribbons. Its one of the reasons to see this in 3d. The scene when the get to the middle of the mega block, when ma ma clan goes overkill on that floor and dredd dodges that machine gun is definitely a high light. The near end scene when dredd pushes ma ma off the floor in slo mo and falls to her death is also noteworthy.The only real complaint i have is that the movie doesn't 100 percent indicate the message of Judge Dredd. There's not much indicating that the character and the strip was very much a satire. Judge Dredd was designed to be a character both loved and hated. Loved for his bad ass attitude and attire, and hated for his fascist police state mentality. It was made as a realistic future based on how society and governments are currently trending right now, particularly the United States ( where mega city is located). Its not all bad though, as mega city one is designed as something that is more likely to occur, and there are comments on how law enforcement is, somewhat relates to whats going on now a days.Judge Dredd is a very well made action flick. The action is intense, but never overstays its welcome. The visual eye candy, 3d, and hard r violence makes this a movie that should be seen by anyone who likes action films. Arguably the best comic movie in a very long time, on par with Watchmen and The Dark Knight. Overall, a 9 out of 10.",Dredd
559,JBrockerDUDE,A Thrilling and violent film!!!,10,21 March 2015,"This movie was absolutely outstanding. Featuring a Dark and surreal atmosphere, unique and imaginative cinematography, and a great story. This is a big improvement to the 1995 film Judge Dredd. This film is really nothing like the comic, and more of it's own take on the character of Judge Dredd. This film has a more serious and less comical approach to the dystopian world that Judge Dredd takes place in. The violence is just perfectly paced and the dialogue isn't bland or boring. The story comes to a conclusion very well and you never forget what is going on in this movie. A dark, gloomy, and somewhat grizzled personality from the main Character, who is also disciplined and keeps his focus on protecting the public and being the perfect ""judge, jury, and executioner"" Sorry too the Judge Dredd fanboys, this movie wipes the floor with Judge Dredd, If you prefer the obnoxious and annoying yelling, and awful corny performance of Sylvester Stallone, you be my guest. If you are a fan of action, and thrilling violence and dialogue, go see this film!",Dredd
560,robcox1980,Dreddful,5,23 June 2019,"Yikes! After finally remembering this movie existed from my initial interest upon its release, I got the chance to watch Dredd. As a mindless action flick, it's good enough to sit through. It's moderately enjoyable from a cinematic point of view. Great color grade, set-pieces, art design, for the most part. But, I'm happy I didn't waste the price of a movie ticket. Amazingly, this film even comes up on a couple top scifi movies of ALL TIME. Sometimes my fellow geek culture brethren severely disappoint me.Where to start? First off, how did the Judges' helmets get past the director's approval? The funky red X design not only looks goofy, but isn't practical for a job where seeing your environment clearly and in its entirety is paramount to staying alive. The bottom of the X comes right in front of the mid to upper field of vision. When Dredd asks Anderson why she forgot her helmet she should have replied, Because I like to see where I'm going. Oh, and speaking on helmets. Anderson said she doesn't wear it because it prevents her from reading minds. So why was she able to read through Dredd's helmet? Actually, why was it necessary to have a mutant in the story at all? Seemed entirely out of place.Then there's the fact that they cast Karl Urban, a well known actor, as Dredd but your average movie goer wouldn't have known, SINCE HE NEVER TOOK OFF HIS HELMET. This isn't the first movie to commit this ridiculous mistake. Man in the Iron Mask comes to mind. That stated, He did do a fairly excellent portrayal of Judge Dredd. Though, how insulting was it that we, the audience, were expected not to realize how ridiculous it was that when his gun was almost out of ammo, that Dredd didn't pick up a couple discarded weapons from the dead baddies? I mean come on, it was bad enough that writing oversight resulting in him being shot with an ARMOR PIERCING round in the guts and literally walking away two minutes later. That exit wound should have been the size of a softball. Yet, when Anderson gets shot with a regular bullet in the stomach she's down for ten minutes.What else? Oh, the camera eyed albino computer hacker. Why did it look like he was going to start crying in ABSOLUTELY EVER SCENE HE WAS IN? It's like the director told him his inspiration was that his secret lover, Baxter the Hamster, had been ratnapped by robot cats and would only be returned if Electro Eyes went outside to catch some rays and get a tan.The movie was also predictable. Call 911. Next scene four Judges walk up to the building. Hmmm, I wonder if they are bad guys? Let's ask the Peachtree Command guy. Will you testify to that? Yes. Bhoooosh!!! And, thud.Lastly, though not the last flaw of the film, there's the whole slo mo drug cinematic effect. The movie should have been ten minutes shorter. Yeah, hey, we get it. The narcotic makes the user see sparkly faded rainbow colors at a thousand fps. Literally, there should have only been four or five uses of this effect. The first time the drug is demonstrated. The scene with the two teenagers buying a hit. When the three guys were skinned and tossed. And, of course when Mama met that same doom. Actually, four, yeah, it could have been done in four. But, definitely no more than five.I typically refrain from expressing my dissatisfaction of a movie, but this one receives entirely too much praise for being such a stinker. It almost qualifies to be in the category of movies that are so bad, they're good.",Dredd
561,lazlopanaflex,Uglier than Otto Sump-Drokk it's Dreddful,2,25 December 2012,"The good news is Dredd is better than the Stallone version.The bad news is, I consider the 95 Judge Dredd to be one of the worst comic book movies ever made, that isn't much praise. In fact the new Dredd is not very good either.Firstly this doesn't even feel like a Dredd movie, there's no humour, there's no real plot- and yes The Raid does the the same idea better, there's no real threat. This is a plain old siege movie dressed up in old 2000AD progs. The plot has JD taking out a psychic Rookie Anderson to a triple murder at a tower block and later arrest the perp responsible. The big bad Ma-Ma has the block locked down as a fake Nuclear test and orders the Judges killed. Rather than escape the Judges make their way up past gunned goons to get to Ma-Ma, er and that's it. Anyone looking for more such as Wagners satire, black comedy and subtlety about the Fascist Police state then pick up some 2000AD progs or book collections.Our heroes can't get a communication to Justice Department (who don't find anything strange about a block going into shutdown when they've just despatched their top Judge to a murder scene at the same location). You can't see this as a faithful adaption of the comic, yea certainly there's the odd reference (Chopper graffiti). But there's no feel to the spirit of the comics. Mega City One looks like a dump, all vehicles and clothes are more modern day-in fact the, lame tired, villains look like they dropped out of Miami Vice (movie or series).When Dredd does manage to get an alert out Justice Dept sends two whole Judges ( I guess the Mantas and the Riot Foam were in storage), and these are easily fobbed off by the Die Hardlike Computer wiz as ""part of the drill""!Even Ma-Ma has more Judges on her payroll-4 in fact-and this is just lazy writing. I know we've had rogue judges in the comics but this isn't believable to have too many corrupt judges in  a system where law is ingrained into them from childhood.There's just so much wrong with this movie-it's Dredd done on the cheap (at least MC 1 looked like its supposed to in the 95 version). And only Urban comes out of it with any dignity.If you want to see a great faithful Dredd movie then sorry there isn't one. If you want to see an action packed siege movie then watch The Raid, or better still, Carpenters Assault on Precinct 13.Iso Cubes for Mr Garland-maximum term!",Dredd

563,ffbadd,"Tense, fun, and action packed. Better then most comic book adaptations",9,18 January 2013,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The movie is entertaining and fast paced and a much needed improvement over the first Judge Dredd movie in 1995 (although I still mildly enjoyed that one as well) Its got all the ingredients for good time. Its got a great dose of tension and action something I think the original was lacking. The plot is not intricate at all which I think plays greatly to Judge Dredds character and setting. Albeit it isn't an original concept, he fights his way through a number of baddies while in a large tower building (recent reviewers keep calling this a Raid: Redemption ripoff which isn't entirely true since both could be ripoffs of Die Hard if you actually consider this a ripoff). Despite all of the other negative reviewers nitpicks the movie is still engaging and fun and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Judge Dredd, action or sci fi/fantasy.P.S. People need to get over the whole originality issue. I mean how many movies do you think are really that different and original than other ones.",Dredd
564,SnoopyvsRedBaron,A lot better than the first but it still could be improved upon,8,28 May 2014,"I have read some Judge Dredd comics over the years and watched disappointedly the 1995 movie, JUDGE DREDD . I do not claim to be a fanboy that knows the entire Judge Dredd Universe.I loved the most of this movie is this interpretation of Judge Dredd played by Karl Urban. This Dredd is not half funny, half serious like the way Sylvester Stallone played him. This Dredd is serious all the time. Even the ""humor"" that this Dredd shows is more direct and cynical than goofy. You can get the feeling that this Judge Dredd came out of the comic and straight into the movie. The violence is to be expected of course, pretty bloody and a bit gory but again if anyone even read on Judge Dredd comic would not be surprised. Dredd's rookie partner, Judge Anderson, is played by Olivia Thirby and is pretty true to the Judge Anderson from the comics with her Psi abilities. She represents the humanity that Judge Dredd either lacks or unwilling to show in this film. She shows to be more compassionate and understanding toward the citizens of Mega City and the Mega Block called Peach Trees. She definitely is not a side-kick that Rob Sneider was in JUDGE DREDD. Most of the villains were believable and not entirely clichéd. Most important of all, Judge Dredd never removes his helmet once in the movie. The entire cast seems to work well together and flowed smoothly in this film with great screen writing to help. Now my disappointments on this film. I noticed that other than the gigantic Mega Blocks shown in the movie, and the Judge's personal multi-faceted pistols; everything else look like a modern, crime-ridden city. The vehicles that people drove look modern cars you would see in the highway, Judge Dredd's motorcycle looks like a souped up Decati with machine guns hidden on the sides. Nothing looked futuristic like in the JUDGE DREDD movie and which the comics also clearly show. Minus Judge Dredd and Anderson and the rest of the Judges, this movie would look no different than scenes in TRAINING DAY, COLORS, 16 BLOCKS, etc. Other than the modern look of Mega-City One, the film does show the grittiness and anarchy that rules much of the streets and mega blocks. Looks like the environment of Earth of ELYSIUM or the sectioned off alien area of DISTRICT 9. Overall I loved the film. I love the violence and how life is so cheap in Mega City One that this movie showed just like the comic. This Judge Dredd definitely has the look of the comic book. However maybe because of budgeting, the overall environment looked like a modern city with its streets and vehicles looking no different than bad area of downtown Los Angeles. Not much was spent of making Mega City One looking like a futuristic dystopian city of JUDGE DREDD. Hopefully in the next sequel there will be more futuristic look with maybe more characters from the comics like Judge Rico, The Angel Gang, etc. If this movie had the setting and background history of the 1995 movie combined, this movie would have been awesome and definitely a 10!",Dredd
565,SirJamesDDJ,Yuck counts as descriptive in so many ways!,1,2 March 2014,"Let's just get this straight immediately, this is one of the worst action films I've ever seen. It's seemingly an impossible task to create a good Judge Dredd film, so please Hollywood stop trying. An hour and a half of mindless and very gratuitous violence, perhaps a teenage boy or shoot em up video game head man would enjoy something like this. But for those of us who require something like, oh I don't know, story or some sort of social message, this is complete trash. As a side note...why in our frozen planet Earth would a movie be placed in a dystopian future and then corner itself inside a building for the entire length of the feature? I'd hoped for some sort of social commentary or ANYTHING...but there's nada. Just more splattering of brains and the RIDICULOUS pandering to 3D when that drug Slo-Mo is used. Holy Toledo every time that thing gets smoked there's at least a two minute sequence where you have to sit there and watch particles float. If you pop this film into your drive, I think the subliminal message is that you've taken the slo-mo because 95 minutes feels like 4 hours. To my fellow human beings, spare yourself the horror and seek other forms of entertainment like shoving bamboo shoots up your fingernails instead of viewing Dredd. I'm gonna go throw the disc in the middle of traffic now.",Dredd

I got all that, but I'm still really disappointed with this movie.I love sleazy action films from the 80's, and I constantly had a feeling that I should like this, but i didn't. It felt like a really, really bad (but not so-bad-it's-good) B-movie with a big budget - and no idea what to do with it. There seems to be no end to the stupidity.*************SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS********* ""Okay, we can shut some doors and trap the judges, gas them, blow them up etc. OR we could bring in gigantic mini-guns (with ammo that can even shoot through the protection shield on the Building) and shoot an entire floor to pieces.""""This RC bomb will blow up, if my Heart stops beating.

Quite a different feel from the original Judge Dredd.

569,gottennks,Better than the original,8,30 December 2012,This film is by all mean an improvement over the original with weaknesses all it's own .They hint at a lot in the film and there is a lot of foreshadowing ya know laying the ground work for potential sequels and all that noise. Where it fails is the slomo or should i say excessive use of slomo it does have a purpose to show you the effects of the drugs the dope head are hooked on but it gets old really fast. I didn't really find myself drawn in to the movie in fact i was kinda waiting for it to be over. on the plus side there were no cheesy one liners and i guess it was pretty true the actual character of judge dredd he is after all a man who does a job he doesn't take any pleasure in his job and why should he in that way i guess he's like any veteran cop he's grown disenchanted he hates his job but does it because someone has to . were not really given much insight on dredd himself but we see him through the eyes of a complete rookie and they hint at his motivations and what makes him tick but we never actually discover what they are i'm sure there is a lot more to be discovered but like i said they're laying the foundation for future sequels As for the rookie she has psychic abilities and they didn't use them to much effect i'd have liked to see her use people like puppets and use her ability to greater effect.my only major complaint is they show us a huge mega city and were confined to a dank slum for the entire length of the film i'm gonna have to re watch the movie later maybe after a second viewing i'll have something better to say,Dredd
570,sycomac,Enemy territory,8,2 July 2021,"Very very underrated movie, blows the 1995 Stallone version away and into a million pieces.Karl urban plays a superior role with no ego attached by not showing his face exactly like the comics but also does most of his acting via his voice and his mouth actions.The concept or being in a lockdown situation keeps the movie small and keeps the action moving along swiftly, reminds me of the movie enemy territory with Ray Parker jnr and jan Michael Vincent if you haven't seen that and are a genuine movie fan try to dig it up and give it a watch.Dredd is a great film true to the comics but has fallen into the comic book curse where they get to release the first movie and not use the characters main arch nemesis hoping to use said character in the sequel but alas the box office prevents that.Can only imagine how the dark judges would've looked in a follow up movie especially if it was made in the same style.",Dredd

It was a very straightforward action flick with no big surprises or revelations, but I was still thoroughly entertained and would love to see a sequel from the same crew.The things this action flick did right from my perspective was that it was badass throughout, and it didn't go over the top with action sequences as opposed to many other action/super hero movies in which the hero gets shot at thousands of times but all the bullets miss.Karl Urban was excellent as a badass Judge Dredd, and Olivia Thirlby played the perfect rookie Judge that's a bit unsure, somewhat vulnerable, yet still tough and credible.",Dredd

573,jamesgillactor,Missing all the important elements,4,19 March 2020,"Movies are stories about change. Or should I say successful movies. This movie didn't even make worldwide its own budget. This movie was a flop. It's missing all the right elements that make a successful movie. There is practically no humanity at all coming from Dredd. That's a huge mistake. He is the main character. We have to like him. Or he has to change through the journey which is the film and end up a very likable character. He does not. He's just a bad ass. You may think that's cool, but if you were a producers on this film, this kind of coolness made you lose a ton of money. That's not what makes a film successful. People have to connect with it. They have to relate to it. No one can relate to anything in this film, unless they are a policeman or a criminal. Also, there has to be elements admirable by the masses. Love, for example, is a huge one. Does not have to be a whole love scene and all, but the 2 main characters developing an affinity for each other, even a very conflicting one would have been a great move. Also, Dredd not removing his helmet the whole film, that was a giant mistake. Are we supposed to connect to a robot? There is no humanity aspect. Saving an animal, as cliche as that may be, would have added a good element to the film. He stuns the teenagers instead of killing them. That was ok. We should have seen his human side. All we saw was a robot. In a scene where he is alone, he should have removed his helmet and we should have seen doubt or conflict, or confusion, or some basic human emotion relevant to the scene. Flashback about his past would have been great too. How did he become who he is? What happened to him. Why is he the best? What made him want to be a judge? So many elements missing making it impossible to connect to him. Without this connection, you end up with an empty film. An empty film will never be a successful one. I wish I had been consulted on this script before this movie was made.",Dredd

Proper Dredd, proper perps, proper block, proper guns (hey, don't expect an exact Lawgiver, cut them some slack...and no ricochet! what's that about? NM), proper helmets : stayed ON. Even the story was OK. The acting was ... good, apart from (strangely) Dredd's first couple of minutes. Once he got into a proper imitation of Dirty Harry he was fine. Complaints : very few. Crappy bikes, I mean seriously puffy bikes. Fat uniforms, not skinny enough. Best actor : Anderson without a doubt.Sly Stallone : wasn't in this film, but his gurning gob was admittedly better, sorry.",Dredd

The script could have been written by a 15 year old school child with English as a second language, and as for the story... Well there simply wasn't one....!Although the Sly Stallone one wasn't perfect it at least had a story and it looked good...

It is a very faithful adaptation that actually tried to impress and go full steam ahead with bullets guns blood and Dredd bad assary. In my opinion this was an Oscar worthy film, not for anything major but for technical categories like Cinematography, Sound and Score. The music made half of the bad assary of the movie I loved it, much better than some of the nominees this year.I've seen this movie three times and each time I still loved it. Fun, Intense and different to some extent ( except for the raid, but the script was written way before that movie and this movie is a little Better in my opinion). Great action with hardcore violence plus an awesome score. I recommend this movie for in the future will be known as an Underrated Classic.",Dredd
577,sociable7,Superb action film like the 90s,10,5 January 2021,Exactly a 90s action film. Just straight into it. Naturally people will compare to the 1995 dredd. That was a masterpiece. But people are comparing wrongly. This isn't a sequel. Just another rendition. Lots of violence and blood but there's a market for that..

578,reviewleon,Surprisingly Good,7,30 December 2012,"As we all know that Dredd is a comic based movie and was made 17 years ago with the same character.Back then the character dredd was played by Sylvester Stallone which most of us cannot forget.When we talk about dredd,the first thing comes in our mind is Stallone which is obvious.So when i heard about the remake,i was a bit confused.I thought it would end up being a disaster like many other remakes now a days.But to my surprise, it wasn't.It happened to be one of the greatest action flick this year so far. It is a very fast paced action movie with no nonsense flashback stories and etc.Sometime the directors puts too much details about all the characters and makes it more of a drama.But this one is very straight.From the beginning till the end it is just a thrilling action ride.The actors did full justice to their character.It is a bit too much violence at some time but i guess its a R rated movie and there should be no problem as far as it is watched by 18+ audiences. The actor(Karl Urban)looks like Stallone through out the entire movie.His face is covered up with the helmet all the time so we only see his lower part of the face. The attitude & personality is similar to Stallone and he even do the Stallone lips pretty well at some scenes.Olivia Thirlby also did fair to her role.There is not a strong story but as i mentioned ago,it has got all the elements for an action movie.Overall the movie turns out to be a strong action flick.I would recommend all the action moviegoer to give it a try & enjoy.",Dredd
579,wstephen1972,Awesome,10,9 January 2013,"Just watched this for the second time, and even better than when saw it the first time. They played this straight, totally in line with the Dredd we know from 2000AD, and so polar opposite to the cartoon character Stallone created....Absolutely awesome. Guaranteed more Dredd films, and as long as they keep them with the same feel as this, then bring 'em on. Urban is superb as Dredd, got the feel of him spot on. Not a bad show from anyone really which considering this is a comic book movie at the end of the day, is pretty impressive. No daft comedy jokes or anything, everybody played it gritty and bleak and that sums up the best story lines from the comics. All I can ask for, whether its the next one or not, is for Judge Death to be introduced....",Dredd
580,Watkinnk,A bit Bland,5,6 November 2012,"Saw this movie about 2 weeks ago. Can't say it was that memorable. Seeing how I am not familiar with the older Dredd movie or the comic books am i judging this simply as an action film and i must say it is somewhat bland. There were a few parts i liked but the action scenes were underwhelming. Mostly the action relied on shooting which wasn't done very creatively. I would suggest that instead of seeing this movie one should watch The Raid Redemption. The main premise and structure of the movie is almost identical to Dredd but the action is non-stop and relies on guns, explosions, and heavily on hand to hand combat where Dredd is mostly about shooting. Much more entertaining and hardcore than Dredd. Also watching it in 2d means you will have to watch painstakingly long scenes focusing on certain images that were meant to look cool in 3d. Boring.",Dredd
581,p_a_bordei,Action movie at its best!,9,26 January 2013,"I can't believe i liked this movie! I thought i might be entertained, but in the end i really liked it. I saw Stallone's Dredd back in the day and that didn't deliver as it had quite a cast, but Sly managed only to turn it into a cheesy sci-fi. So i thought, how could this possibly get better. Well, for once it had Karl Urban, although he didn't quite nail it with Doom which had potential but also got cheesy in the end, but nevertheless a compelling figure in cinema at least thanks to his appearances in LOTR and Chronicles of Riddick. And then Lena Headey, who mostly impressed me as the mighty Sarah Connor, rather than the queen of 300, only now she gets to be the villain (and what a manic and crazy villain). There's also a pretty smart approach: forget science fiction, forget drama, simply flavor a bit the movie with those and just get the judgment rolling. Seriously, although there is a slight attempt at cheesiness allowing a rather contrasting character play along Dredd's apparent invincibility and absolute toughness (maybe a maniacal approach to the concept of justice), you only get what you paid for: action and reaction, relentless hunt, strategic moments, betrayal and a hard fought victory in the end. There's a few futuristic gadgets and yes, the setting, a rather ""dream"" setting, not to mention that futuristic drug. An entire building containing a city is pretty scary, but it works so much in favor of all the action as it gives every moment a different perspective, even if every floor looks just like the ones beneath it or above it. The setting is what actually sets things in motion and explains everything you need to know: ruined, ruthless wasteland which leaves little room for normal living and creates genuine monsters, although they all bear the faces of men. As tough and single minded as Dredd may seem, he is nothing short of hope for this apocalyptic setting. The overall feeling of this movie is a mix between the ""punk"" approach John Carpenter used for movies like Escape from New York or They Live and the reality of today's world. So having a guy like Dredd bring a little order and justice in a brutal manner is just the right thing to see. You will like Dredd and you will want him to live in the end and maybe use some more that voice commanded weapon of his in other movies. Karl Urban nailed it with Dredd, and as much as i didn't expect it, i hope he returns as Dredd, although, if he doesn't, this might just become an action movie classic.",Dredd

In the end I must recommend and invite others who wish to watch a 3D action, sci fi movie with a unique concept of ULTRA motion to rush to their near by cinema at their earliest.......Good film with Excellent music collection........",Dredd
583,socialpsychol-blog,"Violently adult, this is great fun and well worth a look for action fans",8,19 November 2012,"In the near future, the post-apocalyptic Mega City One stretches the length of the Eastern seaboard of the United States. It has over 800 million inhabitants and a crime rate so out of control that the City's law enforcement, the Judges, can only handle 6% of crimes committed.Uncompromising Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is assigned rookie Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) for assessment in the field; Anderson has failed her final exam but is being a chance due to her rare psi abilities.They're called to a triple homicide at Peach Tree apartments, one of the massive tower blocks that dominate the Mega City skyline. The block is run by drug dealer Ma Ma (Lena Headey), main distributor behind new drug on the market Slo-Mo, which gives the users the sensation of time moving at 1% speed. With the block sealed by blast doors, the Judges trapped inside and Ma Ma placing a price on their heads, the Judges have to fight for survival against endless armed thugs.Fairly true to the source material, the film is written by long time Dredd fan Alex Garland (28 Days Later), with input from Dredd creator John Wagner, the script and visuals are littered with references to the comic. Director Pete Travis does a great job, especially considering the budget restrictions; the action is violent, frequent and very bloody. Some of the slo-mo fuelled set-pieces are incredibly stylish and a real showcase for the 3D.The cast are all solid, Karl Urban is a pretty good Dredd, he looks the part, thankfully doesn't remove his helmet, and is believable in the action scenes; however his voice wavers slightly during some of his longer deliveries. Lena Headey is a convincing villain, with this and her role in Game of Thrones, she's cornering the market in evil characters. The strongest performance is that of Olivia Thirlby, she has the most to work with as her Judge Anderson undergoes the most growth and development over the course of the film.The simple premise works well, both in terms of action, and budget limitations. This is a violent, humorous, bleak and almost fascistic film, just like the comics violently adult, this is great fun and well worth a look for action fans. I'd love to see a sequel focusing on Dredd stories The Cursed Earth or Judge Death, however, the film hasn't had a very successful run in the U.S. so a sequel seems unlikely.Much better than I anticipated, a film to finally erase memories of the awful Stallone adaptation.",Dredd
584,sshaheda,All hail to a limited budget,10,29 December 2012,"This movie I will add to my favourites. Really enjoyed it watching. There is no fuss, bitching, tiring fights or dialogs. Just solid entertainment. I admit that they have extensive use of violence but luckily in not an overglamorising violencefest way. The violence occurs self-evident for a world like the shown. There is no time lost by trying to convince the viewer of the main character, he is just doing what he needs to do and this seems so refreshing in contrast to other action heroes these times. While other movies loose themselves in overly arranged action sequences, CGI and fighting, this one goes straight in 95 Min. and wastes nothing. I assume this due to the tight budget which led the producers to cut out everything unnecessary. The woman lead I came to like also...she is doing well. Don't get me wrong I'm a girl and usually more into art and dramatic stuff. Just sometimes everybody wants get some good old entertainment. And a lot of movies then really upset me with their stupidity and boring and worn out paths like Hobbit and the regular romcom and whatever... So whenever epic gems with good aesthetics like 300, Drive or this Dredd one come along I cheer with happiness.",Dredd
585,mofodojo2010,Iconic Action,10,10 November 2012,"Dredd 3D is an amazing movie. Sure, the movie does take away some of the elements that can be found in the comics but it keeps all the stuff that makes them great. A believable future is created in this film along with an also disturbingly believable police force. Dredd is the embodiment of iconic action heroes but in a good way. He's dry and calculating like Dirty Harry, resourceful like John McClain, and has a Stalone vibe to how he carries himself. Some complain that Dredd's face is never shown but that helps create a character that everyone can see themselves being; a person who desires to enact justice on criminals. The movie has a simple but somewhat intriguing plot. Anyone who says it doesn't is looking for too much depth in a movie that is basically about a day in the life of a future cop. Dredd has no character development because he is already developed into what he'll always be; walking justice. His partner develops and learns how harsh the world really is and it makes her stronger. The story is great, the action is great, and the fact that they took away some future elements to make the film more realistic makes it better in my opinion. Some claim they should have spent more on the film but I saw no reason as to why. It looks and feels real and it's nice to know that maybe there is still hope that someday Hollywood will realize money doesn't make the movie. The only other thing to address is the gore. I've heard complaints that this film has too much gore but I just don't see that. The funny thing is that when people get shot they bleed and bones break and guts spill. I know, crazy, why would anyone think that when you get shot in the face blood and bone chips go flying instead of rainbows? I've seen gore. This film is mild compared to what one reviewer used as an example for a less gory film; Saving Private Ryan. I'm not sure if I'm the only one who remembers this but there is a scene where a soldier is seen trying to shove his own intestines back into his body in that particular movie. Dredd takes every good action movie and an amazingly well done comic, blends it, strains out the mundane and unnecessary, and creates a delightful action smoothie that is enjoyable again and again.",Dredd

I used to be an avid reader of 2000AD, and feel Stalone's film is more true to the comic, especially the Lawmaster and Lawgiver. Having said that, the CGI used in Dredd is more believable especially MegaCity 1, although the film is centered on but one building. To me the biggest failing of the film is that if you took out Dredd and the 2000AD element, the film could still be made in the same format.Going back to Judge Dredd, Stalone's chin (and voice) were just about perfect.",Dredd
587,nickknight007,Good Job,10,19 January 2014,"People who are not liking this movie probably don't understand it or only like films on a massive budget, where judge dredd works is because of its smaller budget otherwise would have been a cgi mess.Urban is Dredd. Action was spot on, like the way Dredd at the end just see's it as a normal drugs bust.Hoping they do a sequel but to remember to use small budget again as it works for certain types of films. This only a short review as people need to watch it and make their own mind up.Just because it set in the future doesn't mean it has to have future lazer sort of weapons. Anderson was perfect also, she was a mutant but done sensibly.",Dredd
588,yozips,This is how you do it,8,3 April 2020,"As a fan of the comic, and of comics in general, this flick is a darn good take on the genre. Straight to the point, ruthless and quite gripping. Way better than any comic adaptation of the decade. Marvel garbage makes me yawn, this is genuinely entertaining and sometimes even smart and witty. Urban is perfect, female character is well written, good old practical fx + reasonably and intelligent cgi. It's like in the good old days and that's the way you make movies. Thumbs up!",Dredd

I put this on as some background that I wouldn't really pay attention to, just noise. I found myself enthralled. No, this isn't the greatest movie ever made but as an action flick, it is amazing. It's a long time since I've something this well put together. The characters aren't deeply developed, they don't need to be. The plot is simple, but highly entertaining.The movie is pretty much pure action but filmed in a way not really seen since Predator or perhaps even Terminator. If you're looking for some good fun old school action, see this movie, hopefully you'll be as surprised and impressed as I was.",Dredd

594,dune-74237,Brutally underrated,10,25 December 2020,"One of best dystopian movies ever. I keep coming back it as it rates top marks for the genre. It is so unfortunate this one got lost and the piece of crap with Stallone is what most people think of when they hear Dredd. Give yourself a treat and watch this one. If you're a fan of this type of film, I guarantee you won't be disappointed; you probably won't be dissatisfied even if you're not... just know what to expect from these types of films (Original Mad Max is a good example) and you'll be hooked from about 45 seconds in. Enjoy.",Dredd
595,mattyp-37900,Gorgeous film one of my favourites,10,13 November 2019,"Dredd is a film filled with the most gory of violence yet still maintains a side of spectacle making for one of the best action films from the last decade. The cast kill it in their roles with Karl Urbans talent still shining through even with his face half covered and Lena Heady as the villain is brilliant bringing a side of vulnerability to an otherwise brutal character. The moral compass for Dredd being Anderson and the dynamic between the two is brilliant and evolves along the journey.
Overall this is one of the best action films I have ever seen and would recommend it to anybody who loves good proper action.",Dredd
596,frostypeanut,Wild Roller-coaster of Eye Candy!,7,27 September 2012,"Dredd consisted solely of absolutely insane off-the-wall violent video game-esque blood-spurting flavorful eye candy.The plot is ridiculous fun. A syndicate of drug-dealers live on the penthouse level of a slums district (which is inside of a massive machine building). Karl Urban and Olivia Thirlby (who are judges, which have the power to kill on site and punish as they please) tear through the building floor-by-floor.As I normally hate action movies, I was pleasantly surprised by this rugged gem. The cinematography was masterfully executed. Completely beautiful. Words cannot explain the sight of three high-powered machine guns spraying bright yellow bullets across a gaping hole in slow-motion at a guy dressed like a Nascar driver from the future. It was paced very delicately as well. The directors gave my clenched teeth a rest every ten minutes so I could relax a bit before tension skyrocketed over and over again.Again, not a fan of newer movies or action movies. But this is one worth your time. The camera-work alone was worth the money. The lines, memorable, ridiculous, and monosyllabic, only added to the level of enjoyment I felt. Just don't take Dredd too seriously!",Dredd
597,niceguyjin76,Fantastic scifi that somehow slipped under the radar,8,7 June 2013,"I'm not a comic book fan, nor much of a fan of comic book movies. I had a couple of issues of 2000AD when I was a kid, which I enjoyed, but I simply enjoyed books more. But boy, did I enjoy this movie!!The visual and sound effects are simply superb, and full credit must go to the editing teams on that one. I'm blind in one eye, so 3D is something I'm never going to appreciate, but even in 2D the action scenes and backdrops are just amazing. There's just enough blood to make you cringe a little, without becoming a gore fest.The director has done a great job in portraying the world in an uncomplicated yet enticing way, and the cast all perform admirably. Like many action/scifi movies, this will not win awards for the plot or acting prowess, but is definitely a cut above the rest in terms of how much you'll enjoy it.",Dredd

As an armature film enthusiast I definitely recommend a watch!!",Dredd
599,KoRnRuLz,The Best Moie I have Seen In A Long Time,10,17 October 2012,"After seeing the original Dredd as a child, I really wasn't expecting much of this one, but man was I wrong. I have seen this twice now at the movies, and as a poor university student that it really saying something. The 3D ticket price is really worth it, especially in the Slow-mo scenes. I laughed reading one review where they were called overused and and overexposed (lighting wise). I couldn't disagree more, I thought they were beautiful and disgusting at the same time, it really allows the audience to get into the criminal's head. Being 3D only where I live, I was a bit hesitant about the film as I often get headaches watching 3D but even after the second viewing I felt fine.The acting is excellent, Karl Urban made the most of his character and did not let the half face helmet get in the way. Anderson was a fun character, not too feminine, being a rookie she had some moments when she is not in her element, but there was no helpless (useless) feel to this character. The criminals were also convincing, and I found it funny to see Cersi (game of thrones) play the main villain. No part was either over or under acted, rather each role was pretty much perfectly cast.The sets and special effects were brilliant. I loved the feel of the city and Peach Trees, the grit and grime is exactly what I expect in this sort of film, but it was not over done either. The effects looked pretty realistic to me, no low budget effects to be found in this film. Some of the ways people die are also hilarious (for those with a slightly sicker, more horror-centric sense of humor such as myself). The action was also edge of your seat stuff, not overdone with near super powers but everyone moved like humans do, and relied on gun power (oh yeah).All in all, a perfect movie, I wouldn't change a thing in it, and I really hope if they do make a sequel they make it just as good. And way worth the money, in fact I think I will watch it again next week.",Dredd

601,inquisitortam,Awesome flick,9,3 October 2012,"I'm going to go on record saying that this has got to be the most underrated movie of the last few years. I simply can't believe more people haven't been to the theaters to see it. Maybe it's memories of the previous take on Judge Dredd?First of all, Urban stays so true to the character. They stuck to this notion that Dredd should be this ""Darth Vader-esque"" character, in that you don't need to see the expression on his face in order to be afraid. On top of that, there are so many scenes where you get a real feel for what a tough as nails kind of guy Dredd is. He wasn't funny and he wasn't snazzy. He simply walked into nasty situations, guns-a-blazin'.Additionally, there are so many movies where you get the dramatic slow motion scenes and it almost halts the entire experience. On top of that, sometimes it actually makes the scene look less realistic. Whenever these scenes pop up in Dredd, they not only have a distinct purpose but they actually -add- to the realism of what's going on.The environment was incredibly important in this movie as well. It was gritty. It was dirty. It was humanity as an endangered species. There were no flying motorcycles, no perpetually shiny armor and certainly no slap-stick side-kicks. It was what humanity could deteriorate into if given the opportunity.Finally, there's of course the action. The movie is non-stop action and surprisingly the story holds up well as it goes. Some movies almost pause the character and plot development to make room for action but not this flick.The only thing that rubbed me a little was the fact that the movie dropped back to the classic hour and a half. The 3D was certainly worth it but I really just couldn't get enough of the flick. So an hour and a half seemed a tad short.At any rate, I certainly recommend the movie. The writers commented that some of the slow motion scenes were meant to be ""beautiful"". In a bizarre way, some of them really are.Now go enjoy the flick because I'd really like to see a sequel!",Dredd
602,m-betts06,Best action film i seen since Rambo-4. JUDGEMENT IS HERE!,10,26 September 2012,"Well, seen it twice so far on the big screen and I wanna see it again. Very few films make me want to do that these days. LOVE LOVE LOVED IT!DREDD is absolutely nothing like the Stallone film, its as different as Batman & Robin is to The Dark Knight. DREDD feels like great elements of films such as Dirty Harry, Robocop-1, District-9 and something else, something unique! Alex Garland, and the team behind this have literally made my favourite movie of 2012 so far. TDKR,Avengers,spider-man,Prometheus etc, great films of epic proportions, but flawed in many ways each. DREDD came along, small, modest, yet perfect. It blew all other giant films away this year for me. The Hard R really was needed! If only Dark Knight rises had action like Dredd. Karl Urban and the rest of the cast nailed it too, so I applaud them. Dredd sounds like Dirty Harry which is perfect as the comic character is basically a futuristic Dirty Harry. My only complaint, NO ONES GOING TO SEE IT! Absolutely gutted about this because anyone that likes action/comic-book movies WILL want to see sequels to this. Finally, a film worth my money at the theatre, and in 3D!!! (Which worked great for this film.) Some stunning cinematography, sets and visuals. I really can't recommend you all go see this on the cinema ASAP! Because, if you wait and end up seeing it on DVD, then when it comes to you saying you want to see sequels, it may not happen. So far its not doing great at the box office, despite rave reviews from everyone thats seen it. This needs fixing!The LAW needs YOU! Go check it out and support the surprise hit of 2012.Its like when you watched Robocop when you were a kid. Its the 80s style movie Expendables wanted to be. If there's Justice in the world, we will get sequels. score, 10/10",Dredd
603,bensoden25,Well....i am ready for the sequel!,9,8 September 2012,"I am a JD fan who collected the comics for a few years and was (probably like you?) mentally scarred by the Stallone movie...Well this goes a little way to sooth the pain. Its a rip-roaring 80's style bloodbath pretty much like 'Commando' with the typical cliché invincible superhero who destroys (eventually) everyone in his path despite wounds and hopeless odds. Its not really for those who like to examine sub-plots and the finer points of acting as the main character acts with his chin alone! but...its a good 80's style action movie thats easy to enjoy and stands head and shoulders above other films that tried to recreate the same vibe and only created cancer for the eyes!(namely 'Doomsday'...the WORST MOVIE EVER MADE!)Anyways there is not much to view in an 'artistic sense' so here we are.The Good- Urban gives a pretty good effort at Dredd and most importantly he keeps the helmet on! The 'block' in which the action is set is pretty much like the blocks in the comics, pity the rest of the city does not reflect this as much as it should of done (think Bladerunner cityscape for a closer version of Mega City One) Lena Heady gives a good performance as 'Ma Ma' and she encapsulates the cyber-punk gang leader that could walk out of any copy of the comic. Im not a fan of too much CGI but the SLO MO (the 'drug' in the movie) scenes were actually pretty beautiful and the slow motion shots of the damage inflicted on the human body by various means were interesting too (obviously not as beautiful!)The Bad- They didn't explore enough of the mega city sub-cultures, Everyone was just a mish mash of poverty stricken people with Ma Ma standing out as the only character? In the comic they explore so many different interesting sub-cultures i think they could have dispensed with a couple of minutes of small arms fire to give MC1 some more depth and colour. The city itself (as i mentioned above) needed to be a little more like the set of 'Bladerunner' or a run-down version of '5th element'. I guess thats down to budget than choice? That in mind its not really a true Sci-Fi as you don't really get the feeling of much technological progress.Summary- Most Dredd fans (less die hards/ perfectionists) will enjoy it, and normal movie goers with a taste for blood and easy actions/plots will have a good time.",Dredd
604,amdillow-1,This was a rip off of another movie (possible spoiler with the comparison),2,28 February 2013,"I love Karl Urban and I loved the original Judge Dredd so I went out and bought the new movie and suffered through it. The movie was too dark too bloody and the story was basically a rip off of ""The Raid"" another movie that I did not care for at all. The original movie had better special effects, it had a growing compelling story, it had actors that could do more than just get their body parts blown off. Very disappointed in this one.I am not a fan of the comic books so I can not give anyone a comparison but I do know what I like and this was not enjoyable at all to me. Karl everyone picks a bad movie from time to time this one was a real bugger I hope you get a better role next time.",Dredd
605,danceontheceiling,As good as it could have been,8,7 September 2012,"Let me start by saying, I thoroughly enjoyed this film, as in my opinion, it did everything right. Sure, it had no real substance of a story line (hence the 8/10) but that didn't take much away from the film. The simplistic story also had its advantages, as more time could be dedicated to Dredd doing what Dredd does best, instead of messing around in lengthy conversations. Besides, a detailed emotional story might have made this film a flop, as the cold, ruthless character of Dredd would have been somewhat diminished if that had been the case.So what made this film for me? Simple, the fact that they weren't afraid to make it an 18. This lends strong evidence to the argument that if you want to make an action film that raises the bar, it has to contain all of the shots that just aren't allowed in a 15 rated film. The drug, SLO- M0, that is used by the junkies in this film to slow their perception of time, allows for stunning, and brutal, scenes that also look great in 3D. The 18 rating also allowed for the director to create villains that you despise and you can understand why the other innocent characters fear them, which engages us as an audience.The film's script is cheesy, but if you've seen the other Judge Dredd film, that'll hardly be a surprise. And I must admit that Karl Urban does a fantastic job of making the lines still sound good. And overall, the acting is good, which is a relief after seeing so many action films where even the main character can't act..Overall, a great film. Possibly not the best film to watch on a first date, but if you know what you're getting yourself in for and just want some entertaining action, I really don't think Dredd will disappoint.",Dredd
606,swgjaaax,Best Movie I Never Heard About,10,26 April 2018,"This film is excellent. The characters, story, setting are all incredibly engaging. The camera-work is stunning. This was obviously a labor of love. Sadly, I never really heard about it when it was first released. I noticed some Youtube clips, and went out and found it on DVD. Blew my mind so much the first time, I had to immediately watch it again. Reminded me a bit of the first Mad Max film, and the first Robocop, but I liked it even better than both, and that's saying something. Definitely needs a sequel, hopefully with the same main actors (Dredd and Anderson), same writers, and same guy directing the camera work. This film is a work of art--a masterpiece.",Dredd
607,suemccartin-791-388368,If you played the game you'll appreciate this one,9,6 November 2013,"I used to play the table roleplaying game Judge Dredd back in the early 1990's we had a great game master and the game was a blast. Whomever wrote this movie either played the game or took the time to do some research. The bikes were taken right out of line drawings in the game books and the weapons were right in line what the weapons in the game could do with the various sorts of ammo and the voice controls. The whole concept of Mega City One was also well treated here. This treatment of Judge Dredd was a ton better than that ridiculous movie with Stallone in the 90's. I'd never seen this actor before in anything but the new trek movies but I thought he did a great job capturing the spirit of the Judge Dredd character. I really liked this movie but I wish they'd spent a little screen time in other adventures before they jumped into the main story line. A lot of folks complain about the violence in the reviews. Well I'm sorry you thought it was so violent but that is/was the spirit of the original world created in the role playing game. Billions of people living in one city that stretched up the east coast of the continental US because that is basically the only place left where humans can live. Only thing they didn't really capture is that in the game the judges had some basic genetic augments that meant they only needed about 20 minutes sleep per day. With all the computers these days it's rare to find anyone that really plays table games anymore except for the civil war and warcraft fanatics with their hundreds of figurines, dice etc. I really enjoyed this and I'm hoping they make another one but this time I hope they have a few more adventures than just the one big one. This was well done and if you played the game or read the graphic novels you'll appreciate it much more than that stallone fiasco from years ago.",Dredd
608,eddt078,What are you doing here? GO AN WATCH DREDD!,8,21 November 2020,"It's such a shame that this movie did poorly in the box office, it feels like those kind of movie that are not made anymore.
With that said, the plot of the movie it's very simple, but it doesn't need to be something complex o groundbreaking, it just need to be fun and engaging and that's exactly what it is, fun, violent and awesome.
Dredd has some stellar acting, Karl Urban is Dredd and Lena Headey plays a great villain in ma-ma, a woman far more scary and unstable tham Cersei from Game of Thrones.
Also the female lead has a pretty good arc, and it's refreshing to see that she was not a damsel in distress or an all powerful mary sue. She is a rookie Judge, doing the best she can to get out of a bad situation.
That's all I have to say, if you like action movies, just go, watcht it, and enjoy yourself.",Dredd
609,trine-rogers,Don't Just Go With Trailer,7,1 October 2012,"I saw the trailer for Dredd many times and wasn't actually much interested in watching it. The trailer is not well-made for the movie, it only shows some of the action scenes which made it look like a brain dead action movie. Instead they should have shown how much detail they had really put in the movie! I know it is difficult to put all that in a 2 minute video, but they really let out a lot of the awesome things in the movie. The rookie, the Ma-ma control, the Peach Trees isolated world of their own rules. In the trailer they mostly talked about the weight in the judges' shoulders, but in the movie it was mostly about Dredd and the rookie. The movie was awesome, surprising, funny in a serious way (but unfortunately a bit cheesy 2 times.) Go watch it if you are into badass fighting for the law or into badass drug users and dealers who fight for their territory!",Dredd
610,Madelle,Excellent action,9,29 September 2012,"Dredd 3D marks a return to the stylistic approach of older action films such as ""Robocop"" and ""Assault on Precinct 13"". It takes its subject matter seriously without neutering it to reach a broader audience.In a dystopian future most of the Earth is covered by irradiated desert. Mankind has huddled together in large and vast mega-cities with hundreds of millions of citizens. In Mega City One the law is upheld by a corps of judges, who possess the authority to act as judge, jury and executioner in their confrontations with criminals. the best and most notorious among them is Judge Dredd (Karl Urban), who travels into the Mega Block Peach Trees along with his rookie trainee Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), who must pass his evaluation to become a judge, in order to investigate a triple murder. Peach Trees is ruled by a sociopathic ex-prostitute named Ma-Ma (Lena Headey) who is flooding the streets with the new drug Slo-Mo, and realises that the arrest of one of her men could send her empire crumbling down. So she locks down the building and sets its inhabitants loose upon Dredd and Anderson.The film is extremely violent with plenty of gore spurting in the beautiful slow motion sequences and a very high body count. Crucially, the film does not use the slow motion mechanic so many times, it becomes tired. It also has context within the plot and world of the film itself in the form of the drug Slo-Mo, which slows the brain's perception of time to within 1%. We only ever see these sequences whenever someone has taken the drug.Furthermore, the heavy use of practical effects and limited use of CGI gives Peach Trees a very real sense of place. It is essentially a city onto itself with 75,000 residents, medical clinics, schools and whatever other amenities the residents may need. It is also steeped in squalor and poverty. The special effects in general are of a high quality and belie the film's modest budget.The acting is of high quality. Karl Urban is perfect as the terse no-nonsense Dredd. He wears the helmet throughout the film, which fits perfectly with the character. Dredd IS his uniform and in Karl Urban he becomes an unstoppable force of nature. Though we only see his chin, Urban still manages to clearly communicate whichever mood he is in, his mouth usually locked in Dredd's signature scowl.Olivia Thirlby is excellent too, as the trainee Anderson. Aside from looking gorgeous, she is the emotional anchor of the film next to the seemingly emotionless Dredd, and she carries it well with a likable charm and humanity.Lena Headey is intimidating and memorable as the enigmatic Ma-Ma, who seems to revel in the violence she unleashes. She rules over her gang through fear and intimidation and helps you buy into how a woman of her stature can have a whole block repressed through fear.The cinematography is gorgeous. The slow motion sequences are hypnotic in their beauty, as are the depictions of urban and civil decay in this inhospitable place. The look and feel of the film, carried through by frequent Lars von Trier collaborator and Academy Award-winner Anthony Dod Mantle, are by far the film's greatest strength. I am usually not a fan of 3D, but the slow-motion sequences here really make it work. It isn't dark or murky, but rather bright and vibrant despite the dreary and claustrophobic setting.The music is excellent too with a bombastic and occasionally furious beat that drives the action and adrenaline. Very rarely is there a quiet moment.Finally then, there is an action film for adults. One that dares to address and even revel in its subject matter and one that, in spite of its apparent simplicity, is anything but stupid. I hardly ever go to the cinema any more, as it has gotten much too expensive. But Dredd 3D was worth my money and more. It is very apparent that this film was a labour of love. I am already planning to see it again and can only recommend you do the same.",Dredd
611,kenkyee,thought it was better than the original,8,25 February 2013,"More thought provoking at least... and more of a plot. There is a lot more character development of Dredd and his young intern. It's not just a giant action fest. Nice to see the actress from the old Terminator TV show in this too. Sound was good...graphics were OK but it looks like they were on a tight budget because there are a lot of old cars and only a few bits of ""in the future"" stuff like the motorcycles. Guns of the future with ID sensors is a cute idea, but there's no way it would be used by the police or military because the stupid government would force it on the citizens of the US first and then when it fails at just the wrong time (you'll have to see the movie for why it's a dumb idea), the companies that make the guns would be sued instead of the politicians that forced it on you. Why do reviews have to be 10 lines of text? There's no way you can write that much without adding at least one spoiler because there's only so much you can write about the plot or graphics or sound without giving away any spoilers :-P",Dredd
612,withnailian,Dredd: The 2010's RoboCop,8,22 September 2012,"Having never read the original 2000 AD comic strip, or having never watched the apparently awful film adaptation with Sylvester Stallone, I entered this film yesterday with an open mind. I had previously been put off the film with the awful La Roux song playing over the trailer, thinking the director had tried to take what could be an awesome action film into some Artsy Fartsy Bulls**t. How wrong was I.From the very start it opens up the violence with a brooding and angry monologue spoken from the eponymous anti-hero (played by Karl Urban, pretty much a futuristic Dirty Harry, as he hunts down a hit and run criminal. It plays out a lot like a Clint Eastwood or Arnie flick, with this unstoppable yet likable hero kicking ass whilst grunting lame cliché catchphrases. We are then introduced to the threadbare story of him training his psychic rookie partner, who has failed the initial test to be a judge but due to her abilities is given a trial run. We are then given a ruthless villain and a tower setting for our two heroes to battle through, playing out a lot like a video game. The introduction of the drug ""slo-mo"" and the introduction of the psychic sequences gives us a chance to watch the truly excellent violence all slowed down and made more surreal, giving this quite clichéd film some innovation and originality.This is an excellent adaptation of the original 2000 AD anti-hero that I went in to with little expectations and was literally blown away. The impressive action sequences make for a standard shoot-em-up, but the use of impressive shot types and the interesting contrast between the two leads make it an impressive watch. Hopefully this will be preserved as the main version of the character, rather than the awful Stallone version. Some people may question this films underlying message... Is it a message about totalitarianism? A message against Nuclear War? How we all idolize fascism and secretly need it? No... I believe this film to just be pure fun, a film where a guys cheek is blown off in slow motion, a film where three skinned bodies are thrown from a tower, a film where a woman's brain bursts out of their head and one where the good guys always win. This will easily play out to be the RoboCop of this decade.",Dredd

614,Christiandavis423,Dredd resurrected and in good health!,9,15 September 2012,"Where to start.... I used to collect 2000ad when I was but a young lad. Now I'm at the grand old age of 38 I can honestly say I have seen my childhood perception of Judge Dredd realised on screen for the first time. I went into the Cinema thinking 'dear god, please let this be good', after the biblical catastrophe of the 1995 version. Thankfully I was put at ease within the first few minutes. It became abundantly clear that Dredd was going to be DREDD this time! Many thanks has to go to Karl Urban who absolutely nailed it.The plot you should know by now after reading all these reviews so I won't patronise you with yet another synopsis. Needless to say it was a perfect carrier for the characters involved. Dredd was his quintessential uncompromising self, backed up with a very good performance from Thirlby as Anderson. It was great to see Dredd treating this as a constant evaluation exercise even considering the s##t they had landed in.Acting throughout was great. Ma Ma was excellent but I wish she had had more screen time (hence my 9 out of 10 which is harsh considering the budget they had). Here's hoping for a directors cut which has more of her back story.Music-excellentSo all in all a fantastic film. May not be everyone's cup of tea but my god I'm gonna have a few cups more!",Dredd
615,milos-kstc,"Solid Dredd character, but weak plot.",5,7 October 2012,"So, this being my first review, I'll go straight to the point. Karl Urban is great Dredd. Reminds me a little of WAR from Darksiders video game. I guess he's just one of those vengeful, tough, justice-dealing type of characters and in that way, the portrayal of comic book's Dredd in this movie was spot on. On the other hand, character wise, if you leave out 3 or 4 main characters, the rest of them were pretty weak and non-memorable. We have 2 good guys and essentially only one bad guy in this movie. Call me nostalgic but I am kind of used to watching movies (and playing video games for that matter) with one main bad guy and at least one of his top-tier lieutenants (you know, the guy that you always have to kill to get to the boss-man).Anyways, beside mostly non-memorable characters the main weakness of this movie, in my opinion, ,was a weak plot. Not to go into the details, but if you've watched the trailer, you pretty much already know the whole plot. There are very few twists, and the few secrets and ""whys"" of this movie are pretty much obvious from the beginning.Effects wise, the movie was decent, nothing to fancy, and the 3d effects were redundant most of the time.I gave this one 5/10, but that doesn't mean it's a bad movie necessarily. It just means the original Dredd from '95 was much more to my liking ;)",Dredd
616,wordspinner82,New Judge Dredd movie - kinda cool!,9,20 August 2013,"Before I start, I should say that I've never properly read Judge Dredd (just haven't got round to it) and the most I know of the subject matter comes from the Stallone film and occasional flicks through 2000AD (normally whilst looking for the Durham Red pages).On to the movie. Karl Urban is easily one of my favorite tough guy actors, putting out great performances in everything from LOTR to Red. Watching him contort his face into THE Stallone scowl was highly entertaining, as was the very un-Urban growl. Nevertheless, the moment I saw him I accepted him as Dredd.The Anderson character (Olivia Thirlby) made a great counterpoint to the battle hardened Dredd - a fragile rookie with an expected lifespan of about three minutes. The interplay between the two main characters was well balanced and realistic, giving me a way into the world of the Judges through her eyes.The pace and plot of the movie was excellent, with gratuitous violence sliding nicely in between plot reveals and flashbacks (normally of more violence). Lena Headey was terrifying as always, as well as totally believable as the big boss. The movie was slick, using long slo-mo sequences to full effect (as well as having a plot sensible reason for them, for once!) and creating some beautiful set pieces.Gritty and ugly, MegaCity One looked exactly the way you'd expect a dystopian metropolis to look, both in the wide shots and in the close ups. With a disdain and disregard for human life from both the criminals and Judges, the image of the Dredd universe was immediately clear.The story itself carried a feeling of being an excellent stand-alone story, a perfect set up for further movies/series and an introduction to the world of Judge Dredd. Easy to imagine a whole new group of readers diving into the comics from watching the movies (I will be!)",Dredd
617,ivarschot1,Fun movie,8,2 January 2013,"This movie isn't worth 8 stars but I give it 8 stars because it didn't let me down or disappoint me in any way.THE MOVIE:It's a simple movie, the story is simple, the acting is average and there are a lot of goofs in this movie.That doesn't matter, unless you want to see a good movie, what DOES matter, is that this movie is a lot of fun. Dredd has a lot of blood and gore, never bored me, good pace and varied very much.I think this movie isn't good, but with the fast pace, blood and gore and special effects this movie is really fun and entertaining.Go watch it if you want a good, simple action movie with a lot of blood, gore and action.8/10",Dredd
618,tomaskatztherd,Truthful to the comics style,8,27 April 2013,"I wanted to give this 7 out of 10 because all in all its a good solid movie that will kill you an entertaining hour and a half, the plot there is puddle deep but there needs not be a good plot when your talking about judge dred, the visuals and the violence are all what this movie is made for and you can take it or leave it. I did give it a high 8 at the end, and thats because i know the original comics, which style i love dearly. There are scenes made to look absolutely as if they are taken out of the pages of the highly stylistic comics of judge dred. the FX and style i found to be amazing and very hypnotizing. i really loved the gore which there is a lot of. all in all a very solid entertaining movie, for me the style, photography and FX gave it another point.",Dredd
619,matty_prictor,"very good, not quite great.",8,3 July 2013,"if you love an explosive action film, with scenes of intense gore and combat then this a great film choice for you. I really liked this idea of judges and how they had been transferred from comic to big screen i think was fairly well done. i liked the linear narrative like a comic strip it was very easy to follow. Karl Urbans performance as Dredd i thought was fantastic he had his face concealed through the whole film and could portray no personality or humor but he smashed the cold, calculated killer role in a rather ego-less performance. Negatively though it felt like there was no sort of resolution at the end of the film which i do not enjoy. Also the ultra slo-mo was overused to death i think, i know the slo-mo drug gave them the opportunity to do this but it was really done to death and started to get frustrating. Also it did seem that the majority of the people living in the slums were from ethnic minorities, and I'm unsure if this is some sort of subliminal message, but i didn't like it. Overall though a good and enjoyable film would recommend to action fans and I'm looking forward to possible sequels.",Dredd
620,jwaugh-ethics,"Good, but not great.",5,13 November 2013,"Dredd is a well-executed action movie that fulfills a very basic need for those who are fans of the genre. I mean, it is composed of so many great elements. A dystopian futuristic city wrought by crime, a cop with the drive to try and stop it, a psychotic gang leader, a new recruit with psychic abilities, all of these are awesome on paper, and for the most part come together fairly well. But it's hard for me to overlook some glaring issues, even if I desperately want to overlook them considering how much I enjoyed certain elements of the film.One of the better aspects of ""Dredd"" is Karl Urban who plays the gruff voiced hero (or anti-hero maybe) Dredd. As part of the elite police organization known as the ""judges,"" working with little manpower and against an overwhelming amount of crime, Dredd and other judges have the authority to sentence any criminal on the spot, including a death sentence if the crime is severe enough. The judges are cold and unsympathetic, and Karl Urban plays the character well, which is surprising considering that his character has a helmet covering the top half of his head the entire movie. What I am saying is that Karl Urban's mouth and jaw have more character than most actors in action movies. It is a delight to watch, and I wish he was in more movies like this.The action itself is often fast and kinetic, and perhaps more importantly, shot well enough to keep the viewer interested and engaged. There is a unique justification for the use slow motion as part of the film involves a drug that makes its users experience time slower. Undoubtedly, the best scenes in the movie involve this drug, including a memorable scene were a user witnesses Dredd and his partner taking down some baddies around him. The action switches back and forth between fast paced and intense action to slow motion shots. I was impressed and delighted to see how well it worked.Thus far, it seems like I should have given this movie a better score, but there are some ugly parts than need to be stated. For one, Olivia Thirlby's plays her psychic character ""Anderson"" well, but the character was so shallow and predictable, that it ended up being a distraction. I understand that you need a foil to Dredd's harsh brand of justice, but the movie never really stages any kind of large moral dilemma besides a throw away one at the very end that is ultimately hollow. Further, Lena Headey's character, the psychotic crime boss known as ""Ma- Ma,"" is so poorly directed. I think Headey's acting is fine, but considering the nature of the character she plays, a person who has people skinned alive and will kill without remorse, she is so boring to watch. I am not sure what the director or writer or whoever was going for, but most of the time this psychotic crime boss just seemed disinterested, which thus made me lose interest in the character.The animation is also a sore point. For the most part, it is used sparingly, and to good effect. The movie will have shots of the dystopian city and its ""mega-structures,"" but most of the movie takes place in a grungy building. This serves the movie well because it obviously did not have the budget for anything more spectacular, but also because it makes the movie more raw or real. Unfortunately, someone saw the need to put in some goofy looking animation that distracted from the action. I have a couple scenes in mind, but would rather not spoil them considering they come as surprises. Suffice it to say, they looked cheap and I wish they tried to do something different.I think Dredd is a good action movie, and I really wanted to rate it higher. But there were too many sore points that nagged at me. A lot of people who like action movies will love this movie, but I don't think it's a classic or one that is worth watching multiple times.",Dredd
621,ethanw-hecht,I could literally write for days about everything I like about this movie,9,29 July 2015,"Imagine this, a superhero movie that actually has you on the edge of your seat wondering if everything works out okay. Amazing cinematography paired with some really interesting soundtracks and a compelling story! The movie like almost all modern superhero movies always feels the need to cram exposition to shove their comic worlds onto the screen. The cruel world of Dredd is gradually built, with rooms for the audience to interpret, it doesn't feel confined to awkwardly tie in side characters. There are some moments that have gore in them, but it really helps establish our anti-hero. I honestly wouldn't recommend this to everyone as it can get really violent, but for fans of movies like Die Hard or Watchmen this movie is just about perfect.",Dredd
622,Atte_Peltonen,Feeling prejudiced? Be prepared for a surprise,6,6 February 2014,"From the look of it I begun expecting to see a movie rating possibly three, most likely a four at most. Instead I was taken by a welcomed surprise. It gradually became apparent that the movie presented a sense and a logic rarely seen to go together with the genre. What the movie is is a well-paced action movie unusually absent of bloated clichés for the sake of cheap action elements or for the entertainment of teenage minded audiences. It has mostly great visuals and the slow motion scenes are downright spectacular and nearly alone worth to see the movie. This is two big steps above average and I highly recommend it, especially if you feel like you're often let down by today's action movies.",Dredd

A gritty, modern take on the classic Judge, Jury, and Executioner. Dredd presents and simple plot that feels original. It is able to feel more like a continuation. It doesn't try to tell the same story as the original, just the same bleak dystopian world and the same Judge Dredd. The action is very good and the visuals were amazing. The violence is over the top and it works so well. If you're a fan of the original or a newcomer, this movie is definitely worth a watch.",Dredd

627,crm114-4,Worth every cred spent,10,8 October 2012,"As a fan of 2000AD, Karl Urban and anything written by Alex Garland, I knew I would enjoy Dredd. What I didn't know was just how much it would exceed my expectations. Dredd was incredible in so many ways. The script and design were faithful to the comic but different enough to make it work for a film. Exactly what an adaptation should do and what no comic book film has ever done successfully until now. Karl Urban WAS Dredd. For an actor to completely immerse himself as a character to the point that he is unrecognizable is so very admirable. More actors should follow his example. Lena Heady was amazing as Ma-Ma. I don't recall the last time I saw a villain so memorable. The music is amazing too. I knew from the first few moments of the film that I would buy the soundtrack as soon as I could turn my phone on again. Lastly, the 3D effects. I hate 3D and I hate the overuse or obvious use of CGI. This was the first film I have seen that uses 3D and CGI perfectly. I won't say how so it doesn't spoil anything. I recommend you go see Dredd to find out for yourself.",Dredd

629,mubhceeb,Judgement is passed! Dredd makes the grade.,9,10 September 2012,"Judgement is passed! Dredd makes the grade.Dredd acts as the perfect introduction to the character for those uninitiated in his rich and illustrious 35 year plus heritage, while throwing in enough clever references to readers of the comic 2000ad and Judge Dredd to satisfy long term fans. The filmmakers had their work cut out to produce an exciting and faithful adaptation of the classic comic book character-there was that other film to contend with and the huge weight of expectation from fans in the 17 years since that films release. So it is a testament that by Grud Alex Garland, Pete Travis et al have pulled it off and in such fine style!The first thing you appreciate upon viewing Dredd, is just how well the world is realised. Mega-City One feels like a real breathing place, not too dissimilar to one of our own cities, but just exaggerated enough to befit its Sci-Fi trappings.The next is the stylistic choices that Director Pete Travis and Oscar winning director of photography Anthony Dodd Mantle have taken and this, coupled by a suitably sparse and effective script from Alex Garland, is where the film really comes alive.The film appears to be from a bygone era of film making, having a saturated look that brings to mind some of those classic thrillers from the 70's like The French Connection and dystopian Sci-Fi like Mad Max II and Escape From New York and is a world away from the anodyne and glossy Sci-Fi pictures of recent years- it's an amazing achievement on a film with such a comparatively low budget.Dredd's original look is one of its main strengths; the other is a punchy script from Alex Garland and the uniformly excellent performances from the cast. There's no redundant exposition in this film, after a brief voice over describing the creation of the crime ridden Metropolis of Mega-city one, we're straight into the action. Also there are no lengthy monologues with Dredd, he is direct and to the point, like a futuristic Harry Callahan (long term readers of Judge Dredd will get the reference). And he is a character were action speaks far louder than words as he gets on with the business of law enforcement. To this end Dredd is very much in the tradition of the anti-hero, a type of character sadly long since absent from our screens, but thankfully with this film making a resurgence.Thrown into the mix is Rookie Cadet Cassandra Anderson a mutant with telepathic powers caused by radiation after an apocalyptic nuclear war resulted in the walled city and the scarred cursed earth beyond it. So the set up is there for Dredd to put the cadet through her paces with a view to full judge status, giving her the power of judge, jury and executioner over criminals.Here also the performances are near faultless. Karl Urban, as Dredd, does brooding and intense like few other actors since Clint Eastwood-you can almost feel his eye's searing through the faceless helmet he wears throughout the movie and Olivia Thirlby, as Cadet Anderson, gives a committed performances and is the heart and soul of the film, where rightfully Dredd appears to have none, and acts as the eyes of the audience as we experience the oppressive and frightening insanity of the city and the Peach Trees block, where the majority of the plot takes place.Also the chemistry and interplay between Urban and Thirlby is a major strength of the film, with an abundance of subtext existing between the two characters as they try and read each other-in Anderson's case, probably telepathically. Lena Headey also does Sterling work and adds a layer of depth to the usually underdeveloped stock villain role from most action films of the like.In fact this aspect is another echo to those great pictures from the past, where the plot was character driven and not over reliant on special effects but good writing. A special mention must also go to the brilliant score by Paul Leonard-Morgan which lends the film an added layer of timelessness, as it evokes the early electronic scores of John Carpenter and even at times, Dirty Harry composer Lalo Shifrin.With the film getting so many things right, it feels churlish to find fault. But if there are flaws they would be that the plot is fairly slight and there is just a little too much running around anonymous corridors in the latter part of the film. Yet neither of these factors detracts from the overall quality and enjoyment of the film and hopefully any sequel will be more expansive in scale.In conclusion, I can confidently state, that with Dredd we have a Sci-fi action movie, as well as a supremely adult and successful comic book adaptation that Stimulates the adrenal glands as well as the intellect.",Dredd

632,andrew-hannon3,This version is SIMPLY TRUE to the ORIGINAL!,9,25 July 2013,"Much has been made of Karl Urban and Olivia Thirlby's performances, and rightly so! Urban IS Dredd, imbuing him with absolutist thinking, totalitarian authority and righteous purpose... ...in the face of violent, criminal anarchy and corruption.Those who think of Thirlby's ""Judge Anderson"" as a late addition, created to provide some ""emotional relief"", need to be put right on the subject!Anderson is an ORIGINAL character from 2000AD and provided us with some of Dredd's greatest plot lines, from the start.Olivia Thirlby does a great job, giving us a complete character. Adept, brave and growing in strength; sensitive but not ""gawky"". It's as if she stepped from the page. And if you're happy with Anderson so far,believe me, ""you ain't seen nothing' yet!"", as somebody once said.Some have attempted to write this movie off as mindless pap. They couldn't be further from the truth!I'd suggest they think of Dredd as being colossal, Wagnerian, epic and operatic; tackling huge issues, in broad strokes, unafraid of high stakes and full of violent, reductive statements from all sides.;)Anderson was a feminist pioneer, when feminism was still a hot topic! Mega City One existed in a nuclear waste land, when the Cold War still held an imposing chill! The conflict between criminal anarchy and totalitarian authority provides the backdrop for Dredd's entire mythology.Unthinking action? There is more subject matter here than you can shake a stick at!Previous versions of Dredd have treated the franchise with very little respect. Nobody could be expected to take Dredd seriously, when he was played by Stallone in a cash-cow, reprising Rambo. The epitome of style over substance.No wonder some people mistakenly feel the need, to talk about ""the great one liners"", when they have been led up the garden path for so long!Those who wish to accuse Dredd of ""borrowing"" elements from other franchises, need to realise they're late. About 30 years late, to be precise.Judge Dredd brings us a wealth of material, which has stood for 30 years, and still chimes the same uncomfortable chords.This is the first film aiming to explore Dredd's world, instead of attempting to exploit his fans, his badge and his name!This movie understands the themes, the personality of Dredd's world, and the issues arising in a version of our future, gone wrong.Dredd has always been a FUTURE SHOCK, that perhaps isn't so far away!Now it seems, Dredd is finding his place in our world.;)Bring me more!",Dredd

If you're looking for a bad ass action hero and want some entertainment, then this is it.You don't really care for much of the characters except for the villain (MaMa) and hero (dredd). Dredd is the focus point and he is a bad ass. The director did a great job on the city and you really feel like it is a corrupt and decadent city where law enforcement officers can judge, jury and execute criminals on the spot.As I watched the film I was being surprised again and again. They really outdid themselves and it's a large improvement over the 1995 film with stallone. The plot is there, it fits in perfect and you won't question the plot or the motives of what each character does in the film. It is somewhat simple. I think this has a better plot than The Expendables 2 so if you were thinking it might be the same, then the plot is a bit better than that.The acting is average. It's good but there's nothing worth noting or exciting nor is there any acting that is bad. It's just okay and the only acting you need to care for is Dredd and Karl Urban nailed his performance as Judge Dredd.The film has a good pace and the action length was on the spot. I never felt bored while the action was going on or I didn't stop caring after a while when the action becomes too long.

640,redhed17,It could have been really good,7,29 September 2012,"As someone who bought the original 2000AD comic from which the Dredd character originates as a 10 year old, I maybe have a view of Judge Dredd, and the world he inhabits, which the normal cinema goer may not have. So I may sound particularly hard on the film, but I did enjoy it. I don't know how a neutral would see the film.Straight from the off I must say that with a little bit more spent on production and design, this could have been very close to a perfect Mega-City One, and got this film another point or two increase in the rating (7) I gave it.So, what's wrong? Supposedly set in the year 2099+, the vehicles used in this film look like vehicles that are in use now, or even a few years old, so not even modern deigns in use now. You just have to imagine how much vehicles have changed in the last 30 years, and how many from that time are still running to see how very few vehicles should have looked like anything around now. And for all the faults of the Stallone film, the (non flying) Judges bike looked the part. Not in this film though, in this film Dredd's bike looks very ordinary with just a few cosmetic details added. Seeing as he was on the thing for such a short time, more time and money could have been spent, just like for the city itself, and all the other vehicles, to elevate this film to what it should have been. They set the film in a tower block, which saved a lot of money on locations and design, so a little bit more spent on the vehicles and exterior shots would have just elevated it to something close to the comic. I think the Stallone film had a better 'look' for Mega-City One than this film. The Mega-City One in this film is very flat and spread on, with only the 200+ storey tower block breaking up the very flat landscape, while I remember a very packed and multi layered city in the comic, with many layered roads in between the tower blocks. There was so much of the earth that was contaminated, so what land was left would have forced them up vertically. Think The 5th Element city with roads in between the buildings. Seeing as this was probably a computer generated city, seen quite briefly, if could have looked closer to the comic's version of the city with not much more effort. The Judges uniforms were a bit dull and not very imposing. Something between this and the Versace designed uniformed of the previous film would have been good, but I understand that they may not have wanted to look too much like the previous film. What I liked. Dredd keeps his helmet on. It may seem like a small thing, but that's what happened in the comics, he never took his helmet off. So obviously the Stallone version failed massively on that point. They obviously wrote the story in that film to get Stallone taking the helmet off as soon as they could. Karl Urban does a very good job of keeping too much personality out of the character. Dredd was about the Law, little else. Dredd was very much 'Dirty Harry' of the future. And as I was growing up Clint Eastwood was the only person I could imagine playing Dredd, but that obviously never happened. Many other actors would have not worn the helmet throughout, and may have wanted a few more witty lines, just like Stallone did, so well done to Urban for staying true to the character. It helps that he is not a super star who wants their face on show of course.With regards to the film itself it is a good story, written to be cheap to produce of course, being set in a tower block. There is a sense of lawlessness, with the innocent trapped in between, but you don't get the feeling that the Judges, and Dredd in particular, are feared. If there were a load of highly trained 'Dirty Harry' type characters riding around doling out justice, you would expect the criminals to be in more fear of taking on a Judge. As far as the 3D aspect is concerned, I think this was another disappointing implementation of 3D. Sadly there was no option to not watch the film in 3D, which my friend and I would have done, after being disappointed with so many 3D films since Avatar, and I don't think you'd miss much in 2D version of this film if it was available (which I don't think there is). They don't use of the 3D enough to warrant this being in 3D apart from purely financial reasons. Ironically moving about a city in 3D from the comic would have been nice to see. Thinking about it, how much would 3D be able to be shown at its best in a predominantly dark environment! The same thing blighted the 3D in Tron Legacy imho. Hopefully this film will be a success and there will be a much more expansive Judge Dredd film in the future. Having the Judge Dredd universe look so drab and small though doesn't give them many options for radical design changes in any sequel.",Dredd
641,dravinian,An excellent movie,10,20 December 2012,"Just got back from watching this movie; 90 minutes of action.My fiancé did not enjoy the movie so much, she is not into the gory action movies, as I am, so if you are not into shoot-em ups with lots of blood, you will probably not enjoy this movie so much.It was non-stop from start to finish; 90 minutes felt like 30 minutes, and the only bad thing I have to say about the movie is that it finished, and I would really have liked to have continued watching it.I am not an obsessive fan of Dredd, but I was familiar with his comic incarnation, I have also watched the Stallone movie which will no doubt draw comparisons, though I believe they are incomparable.The movie does not start off slow, nor is there an intermission in the middle of it while a long dragged out plot is explained through exposition and flash back. If you have seen the ""Raid"" it is a similar plot line, one building, loads of thugs, and a villain to be gotten to: this was gun fu rather than kung fu though.I can only say, roll on the sequel because I want to see more of Dredd and Anderson.",Dredd
642,adgarasict,Dredd. An explosion of Violence,7,10 September 2012,"I am the law. This line unlike the 1990s movie is not over dramatic. even though it is short, it feels right for longer gaps between the action would have reduced the films impact. Thankfully, unlike most rebuts (im thinking of Conan), this film doesn't go into the background of the character of Dredd. seemingly planting the character into an everyday occurrence for the Judge. The violence is not as bad as it could have been (i.e not as much blood as 300), but its still highly graphic, especially in the slo mo scenes. Over all this film is such an example of how comic inspired films are becoming more and more serious and good. unlike early ones which are aimed at teenagers who just want explosions.",Dredd
643,tconba-358-624806,Dystopian,9,15 September 2012,"Fantastic reproduction of the comic. The portrayal of mega City 1 was better than I expected and gave the film a much grittier feel. Urban did Dredd justice (excuse the pun, his constant down turn of the mouth the gravel voice and uncompromising nature true to the original. If there are to be more films this is a great start. Andersons progession from young rookie to the empath that she becomes is also well done and the two play well opposite each other. Unlike some reviews I think lena headeys Ma Ma was also a good portrayal of a dystopian gang land leader but it is worth reading her back story before you see the film as this will make things clearer",Dredd
644,adamkhan112,Surprise Package,8,16 September 2012,"Dredd might not have the most complicated storyline but it is executed to perfection, the visuals and direction are fantastic, the action doesen't disappoint and the dialogue works, the only downside is the relatively simple plot, don't walk in and expect L.A. Confidential. Karl Urban plays Dredd fantastically (à la Dirty Harry) and Olivia Thirlby is an excellent foil playing the psychic rookie Anderson. Also worth a mention is the 3D, for once i actually enjoyed the use of 3D it really enhanced the films visuals combined with the slomo effect makes for good viewing.To conclude, enjoy this film for what it is, a damn good action film",Dredd
645,NatalieBarnes,What Dredd was supposed to be,8,20 September 2012,"I'll admit, I'm a comics geek. So perhaps that biases my review. But this is so the Judge Dredd we wanted to see. It's far more violent than the trailer let on -- think Robocop 2 in intense, garish 3-D. It's faithful to the comic and Karl Urban is perfect as Dredd. He's a man, not a superhero, totally committed to what he believes. Olivia Thirlby is good as Anderson, as is the rest of the cast. Nice to see some bad ass, but realistic, female characters for a change. Its not a cheap movie, but not a $100 million budget either, so the limited location gets well-used. I was engaged in the story and haven't had so much fun watching people's bodies get shredded with projectiles since The Wild Bunch. You wouldn't know there was creative infighting on the set between director and writer because the film is seamless. Wonderful use of slo-mo too. If only Rob Scheider had bought the farm in Dredd '95 in such living color! I'm so ready for the sequel. Hopefully it will break out and make bank this weekend.",Dredd
646,jessica-timpone,Oh Yeah!,8,24 September 2012,"Dredd 3D is the kind of movie you automatically get excited over once you see the trailer because you just know it's going to be a good time. It won't land an Oscar, but who cares, that doesn't make it less fun to watch. The funny thing about this movie is that it COULD have been one of the cheesiest movies of the year, but thankfully everything about it worked and in my opinion, was better than its predecessor. The story isn't anything elaborate (face it, we weren't expecting Lord of the Rings right) but it was enough to set the stage and the atmosphere was perfect. The acting was impressive; Urban's frown was set menacingly throughout and I loved that he never took the helmet off. Heady looked as if being bad really made her happy. One of the best things about the movie? The 3D WAS WORTH IT! I'm not a fan of 3D in movies at all; save for Avatar, I think 3D is a cheesy gimmick to make already bad movies just more expensive to watch. But the effects in Dredd 3D were really impressive and worth the extra few bucks. The movie won't be enjoyable for everyone, especially if you hate violence since Dredd is fueled by it. The violence is nothing short of bombastic. You can expect a lot of slow-mo shots of bullets dissecting faces and collapsed tracheas. There is no mercy. If you're squeamish and you complain about it being ""too violent,"" you shouldn't have been watching it in the first place. Why didn't you go see The Words instead? It's gritty, it's deadpan, it's stylish, it's over-violent and it's exactly what the comic book fans want. It got the job done, which is what I always find makes a good movie.",Dredd
647,omnipredator,"Judge Urban, the urban judge",10,1 January 2013,"Before watching this film, I admit having had a few doubts about what I was going to see. Would it be just another remake? A poor attempt of a reboot? Would CGI rule over everything else as usual? With a clear mind, I watched it and I must say (as a mega fan of action Sci-Fi and a follower of 2000AD over the years), it is definitely ""a pass"". This new, on screen stand-alone adaptation of the famous street Judge, is very well done. It does not tire or linger. It is original. The actors and actresses do a very professional job, the CGI and SFX are in perfect balance to the plot and script, the music score is absolutely fitting to the decadent environment and atmosphere of Mega City One (reminds me of Carpenter's ominous and thrilling works) and overall this film does not try to be anything more than what it is: a well made, action packed adventure or -just another day in the office- for Judge Dredd.Karl Urban, Olivia Thirlby, and Lena Headey are the 3 main characters and they do a stunning job. The character build is instant and to the point thus we know who they are, what they are doing and that leaves us almost the entire film in its duration to enjoy the fierce battle between Good (Urban,Thirlby) and Evil (Headey). However, this may sound as it being predictable but its NOT. Moreover, the story is simple enough and straightforward without complicated secrets, master plots, conspiracies, pointless action scenes and cliché dialog. It is easy going, fast paced and interesting to the very end.I truly enjoyed it. Since I am not a 2000AD guru, whether some elements could or should have been made better is not important for me. I saw a solid action film that kept me in my seat from the beginning to the end and left me wishing for more. Much more. Honestly, I hope they are planning for future installments because in my opinion this movie has set the foundations for 2000AD stories in the form of big screen films. And why not? No need to chew all the time on Superman, Spiderman etc. As far as rumors and gossip are concerned, there is no need to compare it to the 1995 Judge Dredd film because they are worlds apart and moreover, Dredd 3D has absolutely nothing to do with the 2011 The Raid: Redemption film. View this Sci-Fi jewel as it is and you will not be disappointed, at all.Finally and on a personal note, I would like to give a special thanks to Karl Urban for his performance in the role of the Judge. His acting, movement, body language, the challenging semi-facial expressions are dead-on to the character. He absolutely nailed it and will be remembered for this.By the way, seeing Dredd a second time makes it even better.",Dredd
648,simon-548-143581,The Dredd Movie 2000AD Fans have been waiting for,8,29 December 2012,"OK, before I begin I have to make it clear that I was a reader of 2000AD from prog 1 through to my early twenties, (I'm now 41,) and can remember the debates that used to rage about who should play Dredd when the inevitable film was to be made. There were two camps, those that supported Eastwood and those that supported Stallone. My vote was definitely with Eastwood.So the years passed and no Dredd movie was forthcoming and then finally it was announced and to my utter disappointment we ended up with that god awful Stallone vehicle. I was devastated and really had come to the conclusion that producing a successful Dredd movie was an almost impossible task.More years pass and I start to hear about a new Dredd movie. I ignore it. I see the trailers and think it looks awful. Finally on a rainy afternoon I decide to give it a go and my god am I glad that I did.What we have hear is someone who had the courage to take Dredd and make him and the world of MegaCity One real. It's a total reboot and much to my surprise completely works.Urban absolutely nails Dredd. Lets be honest, he wouldn't even make it in to most peoples short list for the role but he delivers beyond belief. A brave and totally brilliant choice.The story is simple and if you've seen the Raid Redemption will be entirely familiar, but works and keeps you engaged from beginning to end. Action sequences are superb, effects and cinematography are amazing and the dystopian future world embodied by MegaCity One really lives and breaths.Top marks all round. I really hope they make a sequel!",Dredd
649,christopherwcampbell,Superb Action!,8,20 December 2012,"Although limited in scope by the movie's action being confined to a single (massive) tower block we are still taken on quite a journey. Indeed, the fact that most of the movie plays out within one complex is key to what is quite sufficient in terms of plot. Furthermore, it gives me hope that a sequel exploring other facets of the Mega-City will be produced without being hamstrung by its predecessor.Having read the comic in 1980s Belfast like many other kids, I was hoping it would give more to us than the previous Hollywood effort. I have to say that it wildly exceeded my expectations. Urban was absolutely excellent as Dredd, hugely surpassing Stallone's comic-bookesque attempt.(Ironic. I know.) I heartily recommend this film to anyone who enjoys some good action fun which never hints at trying to be something it isn't.",Dredd
650,barany-570-994024,Garbage,2,31 December 2012,"This movie is garbage, and I am not really sure why anyone would like it. It has almost no plot and almost no character development. We learn literally nothing about the main character. It's pretty much nothing but scene after scene after scene after scene of extremely graphic violence. And the main character looked like he was smelling boiled cabbage throughout the entire movie. The only good things I can say about this movie: Illegal drugs are portrayed negatively, there is a strong female character who is valued for her strength and decision making rather than her looks or her body, and the special effects are good. But that's not enough to make it worth watching or enough to make it good. So save your money, save your time, and skip this movie.",Dredd
651,john-watson-1337,Dredd(2012) Truly Delivers THE Dredd Experience,10,3 January 2013,"Thank you for putting Dredd on the screen. The classic grimace, the introduction of Judge Anderson; the citizens and petty criminals of Megacity One. Pete Travis built a film that engaged me for the full duration. Karl Urban masterfully presented the Dredd of the 2000AD comic series. Every close-up, every action, every phrase confirmed the Judge's character. I went into the movie not sure of the film's ability to capture the essence of Dredd; I discovered a film far more enjoyable than the cameo-ridden 'The Dark Knight Rises""An awesome introduction of the Judge Dredd dystopia. I look forward to more of this series.",Dredd
652,rudolfvda,This movie is a time- and money wasting phony!,3,24 January 2013,"I've been watching this movie with great expectations but have been very, very disappointed.Let me get down to the positives of the movie first.I've got to admit that this movie has excellent graphics, and even graphical content that many modern movies don't have or are cut out for public. I also have to say that Dredd made the environment a bit more realistic as opposed to the original Judge Dredd, whereas it used to be very depressive and violent, the setting in the new Dredd is less of that and more civilized despite what you expect society has grown out to be. Oh and wait, Dredd's partner, she's really hot..But now for the negatives..Yet I was more disappointed than thrilled to see that the setting was very similar to today's society, which essentially makes it boring, and not at all applicable to the futuristic story, where you expect things to be different, for entertainment purposes (what else?).(The following paragraph contains spoilers) In Dredd, the whole movie (yes, the entire 1,5 hours) revolves around one single, repetitive apartment building. It's basically one big shoot-out in a building where every floor looks the same. That's it. That's the movie. The main character does a good job imitating Stallone, I have to admit. He draws the same tough face, he even imitates his grungy voice. But that's the whole problem, he is NOT Stallone. He is NOT the original Dredd. If anything, he should be different from the original Dredd.So something's not right here. The character is almost completely the same, same facial expression, same attitude, same everything. Thing is, he is in a totally different world/time line and this is supposed to be acceptable for the original Judge Dredd fans who they tried so hard to 'please'? Im telling you, this movie wasn't about giving Judge Dredd a glorious remake, it was about squeezing every penny out of Judge Dredd fans with minimal effort.If you've watched the original, and remember it well, you would've noticed the original had dozens of different scenes as opposed to one in this movie. That really saves on CG and studio/prop costs doesn't it? And yet many people hail the remake as if it was a classic. Is it because they are used to this kind of treatment? I think so. Modern day generation is used to be treated like a brainless mob who don't think for themselves. I mean, Dredd has fancy graphics, and a hot chick as a main character, but are those really the incentives to visit the cinema? People are recommending this movie merely for the hot chick! Uhm.. hello? Isn't it cheaper to rent an adult movie than go and watch Dredd? Is there more negativity? Not much, because the movie is an empty shell. People are invited to watch this movie by putting just enough fancy scenes in it to precisely make up a good trailer so you will think the *whole* movie is constantly this fancy. Obviously it isn't. It's a predictable shoot out in a repetitive apartment building. Might as well drive down to skid row and wait for 10 minutes to pass and you can see the same thing for free in real life.Specifics: (spoiler alert) Do you want specifics? There's one scene, where Dredd get's shot. This is the part where you are on the edge of your seat hoping Dredd is finally going to do something tricky and epic to get him out of this situation as the gunner is approaching him. Dredd is down. How will he save himself out of this one? Apparently Dredd has become a psychic too, like his partner, hailing her with his suddenly attained psychic abilities, where as instead of finishing off Dredd right away, the so called 'skilled' gunner who took down Dredd starts a meaning- and pointless monologue after Dredd tells him to 'wait'.I mean seriously? Could they really not afford a better script writer? I mean everyone knows how dangerous Dredd is.. why would anyone hesitate to finish him off immediately, not to mention start a stupid monologue allowing Dredd to mentally hail his partner into the right room in a 20 second time scale and finish the baddie off in a single shot not knowing what was happening, what the situation was,who was who as they're both wearing the exact same outfit, oh wait, that's right, I just said that Dredd had attained psychic abilities so he could have told her about the situation. But why was he not using that skill before?Well I don't know, I guess his 'mana' replenished just in time? Seriously guys, I don't want to come off cheap, but this movie can officially be labeled 'rip-off' like many other modern day movies. Maybe it's because I'm from another generation, and maybe I don't understand that having an original story with depth, details and wide array of scenes is actually not that interesting. I guess the generation of today just wants simplicity. Fancy graphics, hot chicks and rapid action. I guess I'll just have to make my own movies from now on, but I understand that in today's competitive market you'll have to do everything you can to legally cheat people in giving you money if you want to make any progress in your directing career.I remember a time directors wanted to make movies that inspired, impressed, and entertained people, leaving a mark and pleasant memory on every viewer, but I guess times are changing.. these days you can only walk out of the cinema not thinking and feeling (and this exactly how I feel about 'Dredd') ""wow, can't wait to tell my other friends about this movie!"" but are instead only left behind concluding only one thing; ""well, that kept me busy for 1,5 hours, what shall I do next?"".",Dredd
653,mrfarrow10,Why do all the movies these days need a lot of vulgar language,3,2 February 2013,"From all the ratings I thought this would be a movie finally worthwhile watching. Dredd's acting is about as dry as an old moldy prune. He sounds a lot like a stripped down Dirty Harry talking through a computer voice box. Really terrible that all the Judges look the same with those face shields covering up their mugs. Only the rookie female has the courage to face the world without the head gear. Why do all the movies these days need to constantly bombard us with a lot of vulgar language. Embarrassing to watch with anyone around. The special effects were the only reason I scored it so high. No wonder the earnings were so terrible. People are just not that stupid to pay to watch this garbage. Wake up and try and produce a real sci-fi the whole family can enjoy. Why do you think Star Wars and Star trek were big hits? Figure it out producers, it's not a bad thing to be decent.",Dredd
654,bill-cavaliere,Let Dredd LIVE!!! Watch this movie!,8,7 February 2013,"First off, I will say that before viewing this film, I was by no means a Judge Dredd fan. As a comic book fan for many years, I knew of the character, but for whatever reason (most likely the Stallone film in the 90's) never gave it a chance. After watching this film, I was so pleasantly surprised by the final product that I became excited at the possibilities for future sequels. I felt compelled to write a glowing review here in hopes that it may lend to a future for this franchise under the same direction and cast. The film is dark, graphically violent and visually stimulating. The cinematography in this film is enough to make it stand out among some of the best in action films -and that is saying a lot given the limited setting the team had to work with. Basically the whole film takes place inside one building, but the camera work and closeups are fantastic. The use of the super slow motion is just gorgeous and it actually has a reason for being in the film. It's not just an effect thrown in there to look cool a la ""300"" - that is not a knock on 300 which I also thought was a great interpretation of the graphic comic source material. With Dredd though, the Slow-Mo actually is a key part of the film's plot-line so I give them credit for originality. Dredd also delivers in the acting/casting department. I have never been a Karl Urban fan. Aside from his role in Bourne Supremacy, I think most of his movies are mehh at best. However,in the title role here, Urban shines. He keeps the mask on throughout and delivers a fantastic gritty, no nonsense portrayal of the character -Dirty Harry style. I actually am more interested in Dredd as a character now due to his performance. Olivia Thirlby also does a solid job as the rookie Anderson. I enjoyed learning of her abilities and watching her interaction with Dredd throughout the film. Finally, Lena Headey is just great as the psychopathic MaMa. She drifts about with a calm craziness that perfectly fits the film. The pacing of the movie is good. It doesn't lose sight of the goal or veer off in different directions or side-stories or anything like that. It's a simplistic, get the bad guys story-line driven by a character that doesn't have any feeling about the Judgement he dishes out. I have read some reviews that criticize the plot for being too similar to movies like ""The Raid: Redemption"" or ""Die Hard"". Though I see the similarities, I say, what's wrong with that? These are great movies in their own right and if you are a fan of either of those, then you will love this movie. In my opinion, these days action films rely to heavily on CGI and not enough on the organic look and feel of real action or blood flying. I've also heard it criticized for not having enough character build-up or back story. Though it would have been nice for some of that, the way this movie plays out, does not allow time for buildup of an origins story for it's central characters. It quickly introduces the main characters and throws them into a situation which they must deal with, and the mayhem ensues. By the end of the film, it sets itself up for the ability to build on it's characters in future installments. The bottom line is that this movie deserves WAY more attention and credit than the abysmal reception it got at the theaters. Granted, the fact that this movie was advertised as 3D, was predominantly shown in theaters in 3D,coupled with the fact that many people are unfamiliar with the comic, most likely lent to the demise of its run. I am not a 3D fan, I do not pay extra for 3D movies and I do not own a 3D TV. I watched this film in 2D and loved it. But I have heard that this is one of the best 3D experiences to date. In hindsight, this is one movie that I am ashamed I did not support by going to the movies when it was out. I am a HUGE fan of other adult themed comics like ""Preacher"" and would love to see more films like this that properly adapt the source material, instead of catering to the masses. If you are like me and like a good action flick, with some great performances and solid R-rated fun and gore, then Dredd will deliver for you. Give it a chance. Rent it. Tell your friends to rent it. Buy it as a gift for someone's birthday. With any luck, the home movie sales will move this into a position to earn it a sequel which is so desperately deserves.",Dredd

Everything works perfectly and this is awesome to watch in 3-D. Also Karl Urban is one and only Dredd there exists. Lena Headey was awesome as Ma- Ma and Olivia Thirlby as Anderson. Funny thing was when everything started to go wrong there was be very oppressive atmosphere and I felt we can't survive from this even with Lawgiver.Soundtrack is also amazing.

(Dredd iTunes Rent Review),7,2 April 2013,"Dread is set in a post- apocalyptic America with crime, gangs and drugs essentially everywhere and Dredd (Karl Urban) is a Law enforcer, Judge, Jury and executioner all rolled into one who in Megacity one which has ruins of the old world and grand structures of the new. He is essentially the police but with all the powers of the jobs listed above.The basic plot of the movie is that he has to train a rookie who has failed previous tests but she gets another shot because she is psychic and they go to investigate people who have been thrown off the top a slum tower block and learn of a drug den and try to shut and stop it. Then the leader of the drug den shuts the tower block down and then it becomes 'Die Dredd Hard' while they try to shut the drug den down and take out the leader Ma-MaThe movie is just Bad-Ass Karl Urban played Dredd well so did Lena Headey with the drug lord Ma-Ma.The problem that I didn't give it a 9 or 10 is that it's short, the Fake judges feel forced and they were brought in with 40 or 30 minutes to go, they could have brought them in about 60 minutes to go so Dredd has a fight with Lex, Dredd gets away then Lex hunts for him in building. Dredd finds rest of the fake judges which are scattered across the tower looking for him and takes them out with help from rookie. At the end Lex is left with Ma-Ma and its them against the real judges and an all out battle till the death.Also the Movie I fell didn't have enough character development for me it was...

658,avfrankhardy,Gleefully violent but surprisingly good.,10,18 July 2013,"The trailer of this movie is total crap and does absolutely no justice to it. But, heck I had to grab a copy of it with all the favorable reviews.And man, what a blast I had. While certainly not genre-defining or revolutionary in any way, it does pack a punch. Some genuine genre thrills and gleefully excessive but not over-the-top gore, make this movie really, really good.The fact that they didn't show Dredd without his helmet, makes more of a symbol, and you know that yeah, judge dredd is gonna kick some ass in slow-mo-blood-splattering-style. The action was well- choreographed, and as a whole the movie was visually stunning too with slow-motion used aptly.Although, the plot was kind of predictable, the tone of the movie and the acting in general, helped carry the movie forward.It's a case where a pretty straight-forward plot is presented wonderfully making for an amazing experience. The dystopian atmosphere, chaos turning the city into a living hell, an evil drug lord at the top of a building where each level is more difficult to pass through, may all sound like familiar plot points, but Dredd manages to pull it off in a way that I have to admit, almost blew my mind off(it's quite hard to blow my mind).Overall, a 9.5, along with the suggestion that you get your hands on a Blu-Ray copy and get ready for a one hell of a movie-based-on-a-comic- book-that-actually-feels-almost-like-the-comic-book; ride.",Dredd

I assumed that meant it would be original and exciting.What a disappointment. The story was just a basic shoot out between bad guys and good guys, with no surprises and no tension. The direction was very unimaginative and I was quickly bored. Olivia Thirlby and Lena Headey were well worth watching, but having a lead actor wearing a mask throughout the whole film meant we could not empathise with him.I thought the 3D was very poorly done, at times it reminded me of those corny religious pictures you see where the face pops up and the eyes open and close as you move it - it was nothing but a distraction.",Dredd

Stallone destroyed this film.... earlier and I've been waiting for the true remaking. All I can say is that they made a very fine job of this remake. It's very rare to see a remake surpass it's predecessor. To find a film that reflects the original writings, and this film on all levels hits every point; point blank.I can't say more about this film, it's one of those films you have to sit down and just watch for it's great entertainment. Very enjoyable",Dredd
662,lpundaground2005,Dredd - A damn fine 3D outing.,8,28 September 2012,"Dredd From the gruff introductory monologue, Dredd sets up the pieces for a thrill ride that rarely lets up for the next 90 minutes. The soundtrack blares and screeches, the electronic inspired mix matching and accentuating every inspired shot that fuels this adrenalin pumped action film like a shotgun blast.Alex Garland, an established writer with an intense background with Danny Boyle, penned the script for this comic based adaptation, and in each bass filled speech and cocky one liner, he perfectly captures the essence of one of the most brutal Judges, the titular Dredd. His character plays one of many ""judges"", who act as a police force in the wastelands that people now populate.Mega City One oozes grime and grot from every rusty scrap of metal to every citizen that lives in it, but Dredd stands above all as a Godlike figure, given the ability to pass judgement on crooks crimes and punish them aptly, he makes for one hell of a protagonist, and he is the figurative Second coming to the hundreds of criminals that fill Peach Towers, where most of the film takes place.Ma-Ma, a former prostitute turned gang member, is a drug lord that has the two important attributes of an antagonist: Ruthlessness and an intimidating presence. And with her newly manufactured drug, Slo-Mo, she begins to make monumental movements in the city to become the biggest supplier to the inhabitants of Mega City One. In a particularly grisly scene, she makes the command to have three small time crooks who were selling on her turf skinned, which is around about where you realise that this film doesn't just garnish its 18 rating, it pushes it to the limits. This display of arrogance and fear tactics does not come without its consequences though.On her first day, rookie mutant Anderson gets to ride shotgun with Dredd. Her advantage in this film being that she has the ability to read minds, to put it mildly, but the most relieving part of her character is this: She isn't annoying. Too many films use the secondary characters as some sort of excuse to throw some eye candy at the audience, but fortunately, this film is not one of those. She's used in an intuitive fashion, not just to back up Dredd's homely demeanour with a flutter of the eye lashes and a pout of the lips, but to assist him in one of the most extreme ""First day gone wrong"" scenarios. She does as she's told, she doesn't act in any other fashion than the mighty Dredd would expect, and she does so very well.The visuals in this film are perhaps the most stand out feature – from the very first chase scene where slo-mo is used down to the last, grisly one, this film is a feast for the eyes, and all the better that it's in 3D. It doesn't abuse the extra money you have to pay to see it; it makes the entire experience more entertaining. Shots fly off screen at you in slo-mo, although not before going through a nameless crook first, with blood and guts pouring out at you by the gallon, this film lives up to the brutality of its source material.Comparisons with The Raid have already been made since the trailer debuted, but rest assured, these films are nothing alike. Dredd possesses an immediate decaying presence on the screen, with a sense of dismay and fear playing malevolently to the viewer, and creates an entirely different reality that, God knows we hope won't ever come true, but is damn engrossing to watch from through the looking glass.The story briskly moves along, developing further than the average shoot-em-up would, subverting the viewers expectations and giving it a razor sharp edge of humour to lighten the tension. Dredd and Anderson have chemistry, and all credit due to the actors Karl Urban and Olivia Thrilby for handling their characters physically and emotionally, creating some real depth between the pair. Today is Anderson's field assessment, so there's a real teacher/student style relationship between the two that develops as far as it should. And through the ever changing spectrum of the battlefield that ranges from hand to hand combat, shoot outs galore and tactical breaches, they showcase the killer tendency and the perhaps unintentional question of political power.There is a sense of monotony towards the second half of the film, where we see Dredd encounter a set of corrupt Judges, which plays out in a familiar fashion, Déjà Vu is still present in a few scenes, but not necessarily in a bad way. There needs to be a shining light of hope in every dreary, bland future based film, and this isn't any different. The victory tastes as sweet as one would hope, however, and with witty writing and enough visual panache to keep you occupied, it carries itself with confidence and pace.Dredd is a rare theatrical treat that blends brutality without the banality; It creates a centre stage for some of the most outlandish, off the walls entertainment that I've seen this year, with a real taste for the cinematics and visuals, for those of you who don't mind a kilometre high apartment block of bloodshed, I hope you're ready.(And a special mention to the composer, Paul Leonard-Morgan, for his Nine Inch Nails-esque score that makes the skull crushing and panic all the more entertaining).Film: **** ½ / *****",Dredd
663,endorflp,Best Comic Movie EVER,10,3 December 2014,"Dredd might be the very best comic to film adaptation ever made....period. In fact I would even argue that Karl Urban's performance as Judge Dredd is every bit as Oscar worthy, as Heath Ledger's joker (RIP H. L.). The ONLY...ONLY...did I mention ONLY?!!! problem with this film is that almost no one knows the Judge Dredd comics. It will never be as popular as something like Batman. Because of this the film will never get public recognition (like the Dark Night), and Karl Urban will not get the recognition he as a comic book hero like: Toby Maguire.spider-man, Christian bale/batman, Hugh Jackman/xmen, iron man, hulk, captain America, etc. etc, etc, etc, etc, jeez! Take the Hollywood out and you will get nothing with these actors in these roles....This movie is unbelievable on just about every level. WATCH IT!!!!!!!",Dredd

If this is the future of filmmaking then the future is bleak indeed.Too bad the building wasn't blown up at the up at the end to spare us all from a sequel. Speaking of blowing up, why would Judge Dredd think there would be no failsafe on Ma- Ma's explosive device. I suppose if he were wrong then he would have been his own executioner.This is not a movie, it's a video game that feels like it's on ""Slo-Mo"" with endless wandering through hallways shooting bad guys in the face with the main character muttering mostly one word replies. Don't waste you time.",Dredd
665,consumerbatman,"Dare I say, a PERFECT comic book movie",10,26 November 2017,"Simply put: I think this is the best comic book movie I have ever seen.As the credits rolled, I was left with a weird feeling inside: complete and total satisfaction, and not a single complaint.With a remarkably light budget, this film perfectly tells a story in the world of Dredd. It doesn't over-exaggerate the stakes: a drug lord is endangering the lives of ~10,000 people. She's breaking the law. So she cannot be allowed to continue.Dredd, gruff and unfeeling, shows up to dispense law and order, which just happens to coincide with justice. His helmet doesn't come off. There is no two-dimensional romance with Judge Anderson. There is a relationship and a mutual respect, but it stays PERFECTLY respectful to the source material.When all is said and done, with hundreds of criminals in this vast urban cityscape dead, and Dredd is asked by his commanding officer what happened, Urban perfectly captures everything Judge Dredd is with two simple, blunt, un-pretentious words: ""drug bust"".Just another day in the life of Dredd. God bless everyone involved in the making of this film, and here's hoping they scrounge up enough for the sequels.",Dredd
666,list-jonathan,I really don't get it.,3,27 January 2013,"Many have called this an intelligent movie, but I don't get it. To me, an intelligent movie is one that makes my go, ""Huh... I had never considered that..."" Or, ""Wow, I would never have expected THAT to happen next!"" This movie is neither of those things. This movie is a spaghetti western with neat gadgets and some good special effects thrown in for good measure. The gadgets are not all that innovative and the special effects were either overused (Slow motion) or grainy (explosions).There is nothing intelligent about this violent grind of a film. Even Tarantino's Grindhouse: Planet Terror had more of a rationale and motivation behind the story that this rehash of Judge Dredd.Perhaps I'm just jaded because the original Judge Dredd introduced all of the new ideas one can find in this movie.The dialog in this movie was not witty or clever. The plot was not existent. Having said that, this would make a great storyline for Half Life Three... Just replace the villains appropriately and proceed.",Dredd

668,greatones,Can't Wait For A Sequel!,10,4 March 2013,I bought the BluRay 3D and I was blown away! I know this didn't do well at the box office so because of that I didn't have very high expectations. This just goes to show just because the box office numbers weren't great doesn't mean it wasn't a great movie. I sincerely hope there is 2 of 3 of these Dredd 3D movies. There are so many stories they can tell with this new world where there is mass unemployment and crime. I thought Karl Urban did an amazing job as Judge Dredd and should be cast again. The female rookie judge did a great job and with her abilities she makes for a great partner for Judge Dredd. It leaves me wanting more of these two characters. Hopefully they will make this into a trilogy and won't end it with just one movie.,Dredd

In addition, great balancing of characters with Rookie Judge Anderson starting opposite of Dredd. Absolutely light years ahead of Stallone's version.

Karl Urban was born to play Dredd and like the comic, the film runs over the course of one day in Mega City One. This film is dark, gritty and ultra violent. Dredd ticks all the boxes. Bizarrely, it received very little promotion, but word of mouth has been phenomenal.

I mean, one the one hand killing people is OK and even mandatory (""The sentence is DEATH"") and a couple minutes later it's the worst evil in the world.

The cops are the judges/executioners, and they are able to easily do a scan on the person through there helmets.The main character is similar to the main character of psychopass where she does her job but still questioning the ethics of it. And although technically this movie came out first before psychopass, the similarities are too good to be true and this was just overall a bad movie compared to an anime that handled the entire setting of the show a lot better.Also felt like the use of slow motion was just to fill in screen time rather than to show the effect of the drug.

That older movie, while entertaining at the time, is laughable once you hit maturity and have seen enough sci-fi flicks to know what is worth watching and what is typical Hollywood. This is not typical Hollywood...read on.The best description I can give for 'Dredd' is to related to previous films that it shares DNA with - among them, the original movie, a dash of Minority Reports, a hint of The Raid:redemption, and, my all time favorite, Training Day.I am not going to get into details the plot, but what you will discover is that this action sci-fi mind trip is unforgiving, raw, intelligent (enough), and riveting. While completely not a perfect action film, it deserves the low grades that it gone in the box office. I hope as more viewers buy/watch it on Bluray, it becomes a cult classic. I 'judge' a sequel by how it compares to the original, and this reboot is much much better. Enjoy!",Dredd

The trailer alone is awesome and Karl Urban's Clint Eastwoodesque Judge Dredd is spot on and easily erases all memories of the Stallone horror show.Great action scenes and performances from the cast along with a jaw dropping slow motion gun fight make this a must see at the movies!!!! Action Packed and brutal!! When i Left my local cinema I thought "" Mega Hit....Has to be!""GO SEE IT FOLKS!!!!",Dredd
687,swatsonatepies,Dreddfully Good Fun,9,8 September 2012,"Most of the reviews you read of 'Dredd' will offer comparisons to the 1995 shambles 'Judge Dredd' starring Sylvester Stallone. This took a couple of core ideas from the comic hero and added some flying motorbikes, kissing and, lamentably, Rob Schneider. The new Dredd is so far removed from the first attempt that, apart from the helmet, you wouldn't recognise it. 'Dredd' 2012 is a visceral, hardboiled thriller where the wise cracks are dead pan and the violence bone crunchingly realistic.The film opens with Judge Dredd on patrol, in pursuit of some drugged up perps who are creating carnage on the roads. Any idea of comic book violence is quickly dispensed as a pedestrian and then the perps are dispatched in eye watering fashion. Make no mistake, the '18' certificate is justified and the splatter is all the worse for being in eye-popping 3D.The film proper opens as Dredd is summoned to a meeting with the Chief Judge and assigned a rookie to assess. The rookie, Anderson, has mutant psychic abilities and is viewed as a potential asset to the struggling department, but has fallen short of the Academy of Law's pass standard. Dredd is charged with assessing the rookie's capabilities and is immediately unimpressed with his charge's potential. He rhymes off the problems the city faces with the depleted Judge force only capable of handling 6% of reported crimes.Given a free hand to chose their first call Anderson picks a triple homicide at the Peach Trees Block - Huge mistake! This block is the domain of Ma-Ma, the crime boss in charge of 'Slo-Mo', a new drug sweeping the city that lets the user experience reality at 1% of real time. The Judges arrive to assess the crime scene but Ma-Ma is ahead of the game and with the help of a cyber-eyed hacker locks down the building and tasks her addicted inhabitants with the job of dispatching the law enforcers.With no back up available Dredd and Anderson have to stay alive and try to knock the evil drug lord from her perch at the top of the block - 200 floors away. Can they survive the battle against the criminals and other forces sent against them? Will the rookie save the day and will Dredd's helmet stay untouched for the duration? As a near life long fan of 2000ad and Judge Dredd the development of this film has been high on my anticipation last for nigh on two years, and I'm amazed to say that it managed to live up to my expectations.Firstly, Karl Urban is excellent as Dredd. His voice is pretty much how I've imagined Dredd to sound for 25 years and his lip curls and jaw acting are fantastic. His delivery is on the right side of caricature and although he doesn't engage us with much empathy we're never in doubt that he is a devoted and single minded servant of the law. His character arc isn't great but frankly I wouldn't want him to learn about himself in the course of the film - his resolve is unbreakable, just how it should be.The rookie Anderson was played by Olivia Thirlby and again, she was excellent. Many fans, myself included, feel Anderson is a bit touchy feely but here her vulnerabilities added to the character and in truth it's really her film by way of character development. Her building of confidence as the film progresses is expertly judged and believable.Of the three main characters, the villain, Ma-Ma is the weakest. I wasn't convinced that she had the drive or charisma to lead legions of cannon fodder gangsters and her powers were limited to looking a bit thoughtful. Given the down to earth reality of the film this wasn't a major problem, but a memorable and frightening bad guy would have made for a better spectacle overall.Much as been said of the contemporary look of this sci-fi thriller and it's true that some of the vehicles look more 1990 than 2090. There is however plenty of good tech such as Dredd's wrist com and weaponry, and the new, set against the old, does highlight the divisions in the future society.The film runs a lean 96 minutes and although I spent too long looking for the in-jokes and references I didn't feel it flagged at all. I did have some minor quibbles with the appearance of bent Judges which harked back to the Stallone film and undermined the Justice Department as an elite force, but these were negligible.On balance though, the film is a triumph with amazing 3D effects and a body count to well justify the '18' certificate. Not for the squeamish or art house lovers but 'Dredd' is pure escapist enjoyment that will see repeat viewings from me and hopefully many others.",Dredd

The acting was great I got to feel for Dredd unlike the 95 version which I loathed and laughed at its total lameness and lack of understanding what Judge Dredd really was. Watch this movie if you are a comic fan or if you just love cool sci-fi movies. it rocks! the story was great and I hope this production company makes a sequel because they got it right and was worth my time!!!

690,cdworld,"Better than I thought, but a couple of points they need to correct.",7,9 October 2012,"OK, we went to see this last night and it was better than I expected it to be. Some of the scenes were really amazing, I wasn't expecting that. There is lots of graphic violence, similar to the last Rambo movie where you see peoples heads getting blown apart. (not just people getting shot) This does seem to be the new normal, which is fine by me, but it may offend some.The problem that I have with this and other movies is when you have a character that is intelligent, been in these situations before and they don't do things that don't make sense. Dredd says they are low in ammo, but has so many opportunities to grab weapons from people he has killed but never does this. In once scene he kills someone with the exact same weapon as his (don't want to give too much away) but does not take his ammo. Even though at this part he is almost out of ammo. A couple minutes later he comes across another person with this same weapon and he's totally out of ammo. Now he decides to take the ammo. This would never be the case. It just doesn't make sense. How many times to we see movies like this and we are yelling, ""pick up the gun"" and the person doesn't. It's just more unbelievable in this movie because Dredd is a professional. He KNOWS he's going to need more weapons. He knows the first time he's almost out of ammo. He would not leave a loaded weapon behind. This really bothered us as we watched the movie and you'll see what me mean when you watch it. But all in all, the movie was very well done and we would definitely go see a sequel. I wish that we had not seen it in 3D as it still looks blurry in parts. 3D to me is still not at the level it needs to be for people to really enjoy these movies.",Dredd

I think the trailer actually made it seem worse - it threw together lines that didn't happen in the film and made them cheesier. Urban IS Dredd. Thirlby IS Anderson. I expected it to be much faster paced, but no, it took it's time, the slo-mo stuff in 3D was great. Dialogue as necessary. What a fantastic setup to the Dredd world - and I totally get the toned down Mega City One. You simply couldn't have comic book Mega City One in this world....it wouldn't have fit.

I know an awful movie since I've watched many, and this is definitely not an awful film.The one thing I would recommend is not seeing it in 3-D. Some movies are made for it, and some are on the brink, but the movie itself is fine and I think they are stretching it with the whole 3-D thing(possible publicity stunt).

693,Strontium_Dug,Judge Dredd Finally Realised...,8,8 September 2012,"As I drove up the motorway a future iconic(certainly in my little world) van happened to race from a slip-road in front of me, urging myself in pushing my foot to the floor in hot pursuit. While I lived out a self-serving, amusing fantasy, recently viewed in the UK trailer for Dredd, I wasn't quite expecting the tour de force I was all too aware of a few hours later on leaving a huge cinema-house in Edinburgh.Dredd, for anyone who sits up and takes notice, is an obvious labor of love. All the way from Alex Garland's authoritative script and nods to John Wagner, Carlos Esquerra(co-Dredd creators) and the fans through out, to Dod Mantles overall expertise and ability easily enveloping cinemas new puppy of modern 3D. Couple these factors alongside director Pete Travis' lack of fear to revisit the powerhouse action-thrillers of years gone by and we have a smörgåsbord of delights awaiting every adult bereft of films that serve up what that eighteen/r-rated certification rarely provides in recent years.With this film we get the day in the life of a Judge approach. All too often with comic-book films we've seen a need to introduce a who and a why, half-an-hour or so of origins. This compulsion to introduce a character to the audience I felt Dredd took advantage of what went before and instead threw a curve-ball at its box-office and concussed them from the off, dropping one and all onto the streets of Mega City One in an adrenaline rush with Dredd, as he intercepts that van I'd imagined myself chasing earlier in the day - only this time the inhabitants were pursued by a man with machine-guns and a purpose...So the scene was set. Judge Dredd was alive and well on-screen and I was pumped up after a bullish taster of an opening scene.I won't bore everyone reading this with further breakdown of the film as that's where the delight in watching it begins(especially for those of you yet to view it). Dredd plays mentor to a young rookie on her last chance and the location and waves of gang members they come to face build up the tension across a running time that complements the pace correctly. Karl Urban and Olivia Thrilby work together well and for me Urban, a cold hard bastard in this, has done to rebirth Dredd in one viewing, as the likes of Stallone demeaned and urinated over for years.The violence in this film often near pulled me out my seat, as much as the SLO-MO 3D leaped towards it. It has a balance, it has timing...it has that something, it has the kind of thing cinema has been lacking. Dredd as a film paves the way, like only someone of his character and judgment could !",Dredd
694,dilbertdroid,Just a violent video game recorded to play in theaters,1,1 September 2014,"Almost no plot, no acting, no dialog. It looks like a highly sophisticated video game with little content beyond hundreds of graphic killings. Anyone could have played the lead role and Karl Urban could have simply dubbed in the few words and grunts uttered by the character. Truly a production for the 14 year old boys who rarely leave their room and first person shooter games and ultraviolent comics for the outside world. The idea that anyone would waste their time to make a sequel is absurd, since this movie could simply be recut and changed around a bit and nobody would notice. Thank goodness Karl Urban has gone on to better universes.",Dredd
695,ColinDaviesfish9083,Just Brilliant,10,14 November 2016,"I have been a fan of 2000AD since I was 6. The imagery, the ideas, all laid out on the page ready to take me to far off futures and planets.When Dredd first came to the big screen I was disappointed. Not by the look of it, they nailed to vista. No, it was the overall character and feel. They seem to miss the point by a long way. Judge Dredd is not a hero, he is a Judge.Dredd on the other hand, for me, is dam near perfection. Karl Urban plays it so right that it's like he reached into my head and asked my mind what the characters should be like. Yes there are changes to the look, but I actually liked them. I thought the git of Mega City 1 was spot on, and the vastness of the Mega Blocks was great.The photography, they sound track, the simple and small story in a huge puss filled city. The in jokes in the back ground, not making to much of the meta, just letting us find it. The high speed camera work for the Slow-Mo effect, the 3D. All of it is just wonderful.I want more of this.",Dredd
696,DavidH8545,Bring on the sequels!,8,7 September 2012,"'Dredd' is an efficient and entertaining action movie, with lots of memorable moments, kills and one-liners. I really hope that everyone goes out to see the movie, because how often do we really get an extremely violent, faithful, intelligent science fiction movie in cinemas nowadays. I also want them to make more sequels. There is so much potential for sequels, as this movie has set up the character and the scenario, and we can really get into the more epic storytelling. The story in 'Dredd' is very confined, 85% of the film takes place in one of the huge tower blocks, and I kinda wanted to see more of the city and more of Dredd's world. But for what it is, 'Dredd' is a very good movie. There are also lots of nice character moments in between all the action, and some truly breathtaking slow-motion sequences, that almost makes the extra price of the 3D worthwhile.Dredd is such a great character. He is a challenging anti-hero and an uncompromising bad-ass. And don't worry, the film does not glamorise violence, or justify Mega City One's judicial system. People often compare Dredd to 'Dirty Harry', but I would argue that Dredd is a more heroic character, because he would never break the rules, like Dirty Harry does. He isn't a hero because he executes bad guys, but because he is incorruptible, and will always fight for what he believes is right, despite the danger of doing it. If it is right or not, the movie leaves to the audience.Its such an enjoyable movie that deserves success. Now go watch 'Dredd'. Creep!!",Dredd

I really enjoyed it, and after watching it at the theater, I think I'll buy the disc, it's worth a re-watch once in a while. I liked it that much...",Dredd
699,Nothing-But-The-Rain,All Killer - No Schneider.,9,7 September 2012,"The film is pure comic book exploitation cinema with a heavy dose of Robocop (there's a direct ED- 209 quote)and a small dose of action satire. Urban is pretty much the Dredd we've all been waiting for right from the opening chase. He's a pure unstoppable bad-ass with a fair number of kill-quotes (which got most of the laughs a he dispenses justice). Despite having the helmet on all the way through Urban manages to out perform pretty much everyone else and finds ways to convey emotion using only his chin. Thirby handles the part well as the audiences eyes and ears and represents a more humane side of the Judges (something which tests Dredd's ""no compromise"" resolve later in the film). The films main strength is some serious bad-ass action with some truly mesmerizing visuals. I'm no fan of 3D but here it is managed well with the ""slo-mo"" scenes being the highlight. As for the violence, well the films an 18 so what do you expect? There's enough melting heads and bits of skull flying in your face to make sure your cinema experience wont be ruined by some 13 year old chavs. Finally for all the Dredd-nuts (I'm a 2000AD amateur compared to most here) there are plenty of sly nods to the comic's history including a blink-and-you'll-miss-it Fergie reference near the start. Overall I'm just really happy that we finally have not only a great Dredd film but a great comic book film for grown ups to enjoy this year.",Dredd
700,martin-4-330841,Bloody good fun.,8,7 September 2012,"Over a brutally wonderful 90 odd minutes – Dredd 3D blasts the 1995 Judge Dredd out of all memory actually is splatters its brains all over the floor in slow motion. This version of Dredd is very violent – it treats violence like art – painting with blood. It's a very gritty, urban slice of dystopian Sci-Fi very much like Assault on Precinct 13 meets Blade Runner with a hint of Dirty Harry. Dredd himself, perfectly cast, manages to be a hard ass without having to result to one liners or witty come backs. The psychic Anderson provides an emotional counter balance and stop adds an element of much needed humanity. Concerns that this movie ""rips off"" The Raid are completely unfounded on paper they sound the same – but having seen (and enjoyed) both – I can hand on my heart say they are very different movies. The 3D (which most reviews have praised) seemed a little – meh – to me and unnecessary – but that would be my only major criticism. A solid 8/10.",Dredd

Me, and my buddy just kept looking at each other with our jaws dropped the whole time. I won't ruin the plot, but one of the best thing about the movie is that it doesn't have some stupid destroy the world plot. It doesn't have Dredd be the be all end all. He is just a victim of circumstance that ultimately proves the doom of the excellent villain played by Lena Headly. Please go watch this movie because if they don't make a sequel I'll cry.",Dredd

Why??? 'Shocked' because this movie is totally copied from the Indonesian action movie 'THE RAID;REDEMPTION'.http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1899353/.Almost same storyline is there.The first Dredd movie was amazing.I was hoping lot of from this latest Dredd movie but it's totally disappointing.They just copied the story of 'THE RAID' and included character of Dredd to just attract the fans of first movie. Still I am giving it 3 stars.'JUDGE DREDD' was a visually stunning but this latest I think they were on the low budget that's why there are almost no visual effects at all in this latest 'DREDD'movie.,Dredd

It doesn't matter if you are already a fan of the comics (I am) this is a great introduction to the character and the world he inhabits. Mega- City One. It is a grim and bleak world, and Dredd has to be tough as nails to enforce the law there. And he is. Urban nails it. He is the ultimate lawman, and lives up to the name Dredd. The way he moves is just fantastic, it really makes him intimidating. That along with the gravely voice and tough guy grimace. Break the law, and he will break you, creeps!Thirlby as Rookie Anderson, and Headey as Ma-Ma are both excellent as well.Prepare yourself for brutal ultra-violence, stunning visuals and incredible sound.This film will explode your face off.",Dredd

OMG even the Stallone version was closer to the comic then this crappy low budget sh*t. where the hell are Dredds real enemies( mean machine, the ABC warriors, the dark Judges and all the rest of the scum of the cursed earth), where the hell is his uniform, where the f***k is his mean-ass bike, wtf did they do to the lawgiver, where the hell is his pocket law-book he used to pass sentence on the bad guys, where the hell all the cool Dredd one-liners, wtf kind of Mega city is this this doesn't even come close it, why the hell would you make Judge Anderson Dredds partner a weak-ass pussy, where the hell are the other though Judges just say 2 dumb-ass guys dressed up like judges and the bad judges omg i laughed my ass off how they tried to do though and mean but got killed in without a fight, wtf kind of dumb crappy bad guy is that not though and mean enough for Dredd and what kind of dumb-ass name is that for a bad guy MAMA wtf don't make me laugh and will PAPA come a that revenge on Dredd for killing MAMA and the then the kid will come a avenge there MAMA and PAPA ( and wtf would you makeup a stupid enemy if he has enough cool, mean and bad-ass enemies enoughs in the comic). i was really looking forward to this movie, but it really wasn't worth my time. i have no idea WTF it got so good reviews on here and WTF when i read in some reviews that they are Dredd fans and they like the movie. believe me a real fan of the comic will hate this movie, and it's absolutely not better then the Sly version in terms of Dredd adaptation, sure it has more action and more gore, but sly's version was closer to Dredd the comic. everything is wrong in this movie. OMG with the CGI of this time it could have made the real deal, why would you like to make a movie comic-book hero and make him so unlike the comic-book, that like making a spider-man, batman, superman, iron-man, and other comic heroes movie and then don't dress them up in there suite and make up a lame-ass cheap-ass suite that doesn't even come close the real-thing just because you think it would look better on the screen, no HELL NO.

I don't know but the fact that it was filmed inside in the same scene for a good portion f the movie just turned it really boring for me. The beginning was really kool starting out the scenery was good. The lead character didn't impress me much, and he whole attitude toward the female cop was somewhat unprofessional then you would expect the law to carry conversations in the future. The movie just needed some outside involvement so it didn't feel compacted in the same scene.

707,ama-yeti,A REAL future - update your expectations of your own life.,10,23 March 2013,"Simply this movie presents a realistic future. Escapism is rudely rejected. It MAKES you think about what future life will be like for you personally. In my humble opinion, that that was what Philip K Dick, George Orwell, Aldous Huxley and others so carefully aspired to do. Science Fiction as a prediction of aspects of our mutual future. Food for thought. A cautionary tale. Even partly a morality play. Things to avoid. Things to individually improve. The future of our society. What we should aim for. What we should avoid. Not the petty politics of greed, small aspiration, self-interest or the politics of today. Planning a better future or what will happen if we do not. Awareness. So many movies try to defuse the meaning of the original work. To destroy the thought provoking intention of the original. To make us happy, entertained and oblivious to the true meaning of the work. To keep us an ignorant, uncoordinated and divided society - compliant and easily corrupted. Comics have remained one of the last bastions of intellectual inquiry into our future. This movie is so rare. It presents an honest though simplified mirror to the original comic. I hope after watching this you are encouraged to think for yourself about your future and our collective prospects. And I hope you are inspired to read comics like 2000AD. And to think.

Fight scenes and special effects are worth seeing. It will be a good home movie to get once it gets on the shelves. I've seen worst but I've sen better. Not showing Dredd's face is kind of a letdown.

710,sinnerdragoon,Dredd is awesome,10,14 May 2014,This movie blew the old Stallone version out of the water. Mega City 1 was awesome and made me feel like this is what a post apocalyptic city struggling to survive would look like. The uniforms where great and gave both the feel of the original comics and made them look realistic and functional.Karl urban did a fantastic job as Dredd and is ready to play him again. Olivia Thirlby did an excellent job as well and even she says she is ready for a sequel.The best part of this movie is that it didn't have Rob Derp Schneider in it. Also it didn't have Stallone and his ego insisting that he not wear the helmet.This movie definitely needs a sequel or five. there is so much in the 2000 AD comics that could be made into awesome movies.

711,psykikvandal,Well Drokking done!!!!,10,13 September 2012,"The only way this film could be better would be if they had not released it until a week before the sequel! Even if the sequel turns out to be awful! It isn't a direct take on the comics, which is a VERY smart move. It's much more gritty, less ""futuristic"" (by which , I mean that it's less Buck Rogers, more Robocop)and plays down the humour more than a direct copy would do. Notice I said would and not should. If they had tried to replicate the original comics it would have been another failed attempt: wallowing in pastiche but taking itself too seriously/not seriously enough. This is serious enough without trying to be too clever. It provides old school Dredd fans (like myself) with more than enough homage to keep us smiling knowingly at all the little references that may fly over the heads of those not so well versed in the world of Mega-City One, but also enough action, story and, most importantly, characterization to show the rest of the world who Judge Dredd and Judge Anderson actually are. It doesn't dwell on long, drawn out scenes depicting the characters' histories. It just provides us with enough to understand the characters we watch develop on screen. of course, the casting REALLY helps. Hats off to Denton Douglas, Kate Dowd and Sarah Finn for their perfect choices (anyone who likes this film owes it to thank these people!). Dredd doesn't just pander to fans though, we ALL get something a bit new and no one is alienated. This isn't deep. It's not filled with twists and turns. And it shouldn't be. It's JUDGE DREDD! This time, they've got it right!..........WAIT! One criticism.....No one says Drokk!.....but maybe that's why it works. Erik Tricity",Dredd
712,obitus-1,Overrated movie literally,1,25 December 2012,"This movie is a good example that there are ways to give a movie way higher average rating on IMDb then it deserves. I also found some highly suspicious reviews with 10/10 stars and 100+ useful review votes from users within a very short time-span;most likely due to some private small company hired to hype up the scores and write predefined payed reviews.If you want to see a good action movie that has the same theme;watch raid redemption. This one is like some previous posters wrote a clone between a video game and bad copy of raid redemption.Only reason to watch this is if you got a date since it gives you pretty high odds to get laid, since it gets so boring to watch after a while;she will focus her attention to some more interesting things, rather then watching this crap.

The story felt very similar to an Indonesian movie called the raid redemption where in both movies their stuck in a building and have to keep going up the levels. This wouldn't bother me as much if it was as entertaining as the raid redemption but its not even close. Their is not even that much action for the most part, their are two action scenes that are in slow motion which were very impressive with stuff flying, blood spiriting and bullets going thought people's check and coming out the other which was pretty cool. But their both early in the film and the rest of the film is just them moving up the levels, talking and two very boring shot outs.

The characters are pastiches and the story line is ""unengaging"" (except perhaps for the devotees of the comic book). My eyes grew tired of looking at the gray walls, the main backdrop for most of the movie. There's quite a few worthy books that could have worked much better being translated to celluloid than this. Anderson may be the one saving grace, a character viewers can relate to. But nothing much is made of her other than as a prop in the action violence. There was a potential to get some human drama into the presentation in the scene with the mother whose husband Anderson has just shot. But that was skimmed over.

I would not recommend it to anyone except fans of the comic. It is slow. The action scenes are fine but the story is like molasses. The time frame is short, the character development is minimal.It is trite. The opening scene is a tedious & clichéd introduction to the main character (Dredd), the way the city and the judge system operates, and the primary story hook (the Slow Down Drug). It feels a lot like Robocop but without the style or charm. And almost 30 years too late. Too many instances of people dropping background story points into conversation in ways that would be illogical to someone in that world; I'm sure we can figure out the background story if it's implied rather than explicitly spelled out. There was significant budget shoveled into this film as witnessed by the special effects, but it feels like the cinematography or editing lacks the punch that you'd expect. It's just a story, not an adventure. It could be the lighting, music, post production - I don't know but it comes across very lacking.Perhaps the problem with this is that the main character is expressionless and monotone, literally faceless. Fans will say that's the whole point, or that is as intended. Perhaps it's the story or the script - feels cheap and pointless, but again maybe that's how it should be.All I can tell you is that I don't care for it at all. I would pay money to avoid watching it again.",Dredd
718,multimedia-383-125404,America's Issue with violence,1,28 December 2012,"This is my first review, so bear with me. I am not normally the guy who rates movies because i think that everyone should form his or her own opinion about something. However in this case i just have to write a short statement. I think (and that is me) this movie is absolutely rubbish and fails in more than one way. When i saw the Film, i came to suspect, that it was only made to glorify violence. It shows perfectly, what's wrong with America and it's so called ""Entertainment Industry"". Don't get me wrong, violence is a part of peoples lives and therefore the movies they make. what bothers me the most is the way you show violence to the audience. apparently you can show anything without a public outcry, as long as you don't show anything as natural as sex (and i don't mean porn). I have a high tolerance towards movie-violence, because i used to work for 25 years in the movie-industry. I just think that there are limits on how you show violence to an audience, especially a younger one. I kind of like the first ""Judge Dredd"" outing with Stallone. Alltough it was pretty bloody for it's Time in 1995, it still had a good sense of humour and it also showed a very human side of the main characters. Violence and Blood is okay, as long as you have a counterpart to it (check out Tarantino).This ""Dredd"" is just plain ugly, stupid and senseless. Perhaps in Europe we have a different aspect towards violence in the movies.",Dredd
719,alankelly67,This movie is guilty as charged: Brutally Brilliant!,10,14 September 2012,"Absolutely fantastic sci-fi action thriller movie and a vast improvement on the 1995 version! This 2012 version is more grounded and more harsher and more violent and gets to the grittiness of street Judging whilst the '95 incarnation was more political and ""funny"" and, ironically, I always felt was too comic bookish for a movie adaptation of a comic book like 2000AD! Basically the '95 movie was to 2000AD what the Batman & Robin movie was to the Batman comic book - damn near movie franchise killers!The storyline is a basic one but it sustains the 95-minutes of this movie. In fact, after watching Dredd I felt I'd been watching something that was much longer than 95-minutes to me. It definitely kept me entertained and, as a newcomer, this movie inspired me to learn more about 2000AD and Judge Dredd like no other movie adaptations of comic books I've seen has done before so that's another feather in this movies cap as far as I'm concerned.Dredd has great performances from the entire cast! Karl Urban was amazing in his performance as Dredd! He played Dredd as a street hardened, tightly wound Judge fighting an inner rage that you feel could explode in your face at any moment given the slightest provocation! Also massive kudos to Urban for not taking the helmet off! I think I can safely say that Urban's Dredd was uncompromisingly The Law! I was also hugely impressed with Olivia Thirlby who plays rookie Judge, Anderson! As Anderson, Thirlby represents the emotional touchstone of the movie and brings elements the veteran Judge Dredd has suppressed in order to do his job. Meanwhile Lena Headey plays Ma-Ma as a cold, calculating, brutal, not-to-be crossed ruler of her own domain and poses a very real threat against Dredd and his rookie sidekick!Dredd is most definitely a movie I recommend going to see!I very sincerely hope there's going to be a sequel!",Dredd
720,lee_woodruff,There's a new sheriff in town,9,7 September 2012,"Having been a fan since I was a kid and after being disappointed with the 1995 version I had reservations about this film when it was released that it was being remade. In the run up to the release date very little information was being made available until London film and comic con where five minutes of footage was shown. Comparisons were being made between Dredd and The Raid: Redemption, drug dealers & and criminals in a high rise with the kozzers tipping up to clap them in irons. To be honest Dredd makes The Raid look like play school. The film opens with Dredd (Urban) providing the viewer with a brief overview of mega city 1 and the judges. Then we're straight in to chasing perps and dispensing justice. It quickly becomes clear that the writers have actually done their homework. In the comic Dredd is not the most verbose of individuals and this personality trait is evident with Urban's portrayal of our protagonist. I liked the addition of a young Judge Anderson and the way that her abilities were introduced setting things up nicely for a proposed sequel including the dark judges. I don't want to go in to too much detail, but I did feel as if I was watching the comic. Dredd's world is full of violence and gloom and this was portrayed effectively throughout. Ma Ma (Headey) is a suitably vicious villain and the audience will not feel short changed. (big-ish spoiler if you have to send a message do it publicly!) A particularly nice touch is the view of slo-mo from the users perspective.All in all Alex Garland has done a stand up job, if you're a fan you'll be a happy bunny when you leave the theatre, if you're new to Dredd there's a good chance that you'll leave wanting more.",Dredd
721,paulhuggett-472-229521,Drokking Great!,9,10 September 2012,"First and foremast Dredd has a very simple plot which if we all admit is is a lot like The Raid - but you are introducing a British comic book icon to a worldwide culture that has only ever heard of Sly Stallone. Having been a massive fan of Dredd over the years I'm so happy that despite the simple plot they have really nailed the characters for me.Karl Urban as Dredd did a fantastic job and it is a testament to his ability that I went home practicing my Dredd chin in the car. He is sparing with the lines, suitably grim in delivering justice and I really hope that this movie makes enough for the 'bean counters' to justify a sequel or a trilogy so we can get to some more of the juicer Dredd story lines.Go see it!",Dredd
722,g-sanderson-473-735994,Brutalility in its most beautiful visceral form,9,10 September 2012,"If any of you have the natural reservations about Dredd it can only be because of one of the following, A) You watched the 1995 Sylvester Stallone version B) You don't really know anything about the Judge Dredd cannon C) Karl Urban isn't a big enough star for youFear not! The film is very easy to get into. There is no complicated back story just instant brutality and carnage. I came out of the film feeling a little confused as to whether the film glorified drug taking or violence and quickly realised the answer is a simple NO. What Dredd made me think was that if I lived in Mega City One my lifestyle would be a lot better than it is now, wait scratch that, I would actually be a model citizen for fear of running afoul of Judge Dredd!Karl Urban is utterly menacing and that is before he has ever uttered a word, he clearly conveys a lot of pent up aggression and emotion without ever even taking his helmet off, the voice, the chin it all works!I for one cant wait for the sequel!",Dredd

Roll on the sequel",Dredd
724,omarr_11,Brilliant!,10,17 September 2012,"Easily the best action movie of the year. At first I had my doubts about whether it will be another remaking flop like all of the other remakes Hollywood produce(except Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy) and whether Karl Urban will play a better role of Dredd than Stallone and the fact that the movie is so low budgeted. But you know what, for a movie with such a low budget compared to all the other top movies like the Dark Knight Rises. I'll have to admit it didn't look low budgeted at all! the producers did a fantastic job. Special effects were remarkable especially in 3D, CGI wasn't over the top and it had a decent and ruthless story line. A must see for the fans of the comic book, Karl Urban did a fantastic job!!",Dredd
725,RyWater,Great movie bad user reviews,10,3 May 2013,"@ tieman64 and any other 1 star taters that write novels on why the movie was ""terrible"" - If you review movies simply to show people how much you know about American history and how culture and economics can be scrutinized in a movie, go to your nearest community college and preach in the halls about how much you know. Someone will listen. Or maybe blog about it, I hear that's fun. No one cares about how much you know. So going on a movie review board and posting 1 out of 10 making it literally the worst movie you have scene is unrealistic. There is a laundry list of crummy straight to DVD movies that are worse.Like wise to balance that most of us who enjoy it have to post at 8 or 10 stars to balance out your stupidity. The movie was fun, and was 100x better than the ""judge dredd"" hated in the 90's. This film is a great interpretation of the comic keeping true to some of the ideas originally shown in the 70s with a new age view that blends more modern day concepts. I can't speak for anyone but myself but it was fun to watch, I wasn't let down and overall was a great movie.",Dredd
726,dvajenks,Best Terrible Movie of all time,10,24 September 2012,"Not as many tits as expected. Still incredible for a bad movie. Worth watching. I smile thinking of it. The visuals are pretty good for a bad movie and the gore is right there with it. They weren't afraid to go too far and it was successful. Whatever boner people got from watching expendables or expendables 2 can be achieved with this movie with no problem. The best part about it is, there are no really famous actors in it where you'll be disappointed that they have stooped so low. This movie was definitely bad in terms of narrative. As my friend put it: ""They spent no time at all on narrative."" It was, in fact, pure action and cheesy amazingness. Watch it. Do it",Dredd
727,cklopfer1987,The Dredd This Audience Needs,8,24 September 2012,"Cleaning up the mess that was the '95 Stallone film is not an easy feat. Though every reviewer here will tell you why it was a bad movie and why there are still people who love it, the fact remains the same: The moment we heard a new Judge Dredd movie would be released we all immediately thought of the 1995 film. In the face of such adversity this film propels itself so far past the sour taste it's predecessor left in our mouths that it stands at the ranks of, in this reviewer's opinion, one of the best action films of the year. Now don't get me wrong, I am someone who can greatly appreciate a Stallone/Schneider team up. I won't begin to lie to you, the reader, that the '95 movie wasn't something I enjoyed. I did. One does not watch a film oriented around a dystopian future with law enforcers playing the role of judge, jury and executioner and expect to see Citizen Cane(that's dry, I apologize). The point is that the film was entertaining. This current rendition of the Judge Dredd lore is a wholly different experience. For it's modest forty five million dollar budget it is a very good film, one that will more than likely not see it's money back. That is a regrettable forecast given that it is actually a fine film. In this day and age everyone fancies themselves a film connoisseur. With the advent of the internet I will ironically point out that the days of people simply enjoying a film have come and gone. Everyone has an opinion. It is my hope that enough reviews will come in that reveal this movie to be one worth the admission price. Yes, the film takes place largely in one location, but it is paced in such a way that little to no attention is lost. Yes, there are lines that can be called cheesy but those very lines are also the reason why we let out squeals of excitement. Lines that cause us to prod our neighbors with elbows in blind euphoric action-induced pleasure. The film entertains. Karl Urban is a superb Dredd. What other actor revels in portraying a role that does not at any point require showing his/her face. Urban eats this up, and he does so with vigor. The violence is there. The action is there. What more do we need? It is a September release. The film knows what it is and it embraces that role. If not for it's unfortunate marketing campaign and the weight of it's previous incarnation dragging it down into movie hell this movie would be a well appreciated interpretation of the Judge Dredd comics. For a large amount of viewers, that is what it will be. For the viewers not formally introduced to the character, give this film a chance. It will please you. That is what this picture is here to do. It is here to please. And please you, it will. My hat comes off to Pete Travis for being bold enough to make this film. Not only that, but to take on this challenge and make an aggressively enjoyable film despite the odds. If you are one of those people who rents every film you hear about after the academy awards, move on. If not, than give this one a shot or stand to be judged.",Dredd

Braveheart was awesome and saving private Ryan as well.......I cannot believe the amount of GORE in this movie. This should have been rated nc-17 or worse, i think they directed it to showcase how much blood and guts they can put onto the screen. If I hadn't paid 12.00 to see it I would have walked out. There are no redeeming qualities to this movie. This kind of crap ruins what could have been a good movie. Directors need to limit this...Do yourself a favor don't go and see this. Definitely don't let your kids or spouses watch it. Somethings should not be seen....especially over and over again for shock value alone.

730,rogerlaidler86,eventful but overrated,7,10 October 2012,"If your looking for a movie with action, violence mixed with a little fantasy then this is the film for you. Dredd 3d is a bit of a 'take your brain out' and enjoy, compared to the disastrous 1995 original 'Judge Dredd' this is a triumph. There is plenty happening for the action people, one liners, explosions, a beautiful woman, nasty villains and a dystopic location which Dredd was alway based on. One of the main reasons this works is that it sticks to the comic book more than the 1995 feature (also no helmet removal).Furthermore the use of the 3d fills the film well and is very innovative. It identifies the use of the drug slo-mo brilliantly to the extent where the viewer feels they are connecting with the 'slo'wness an use of the drug.Needs to be seen at the cinema in my view, would not get the full value on DVD but would hope i will be proved wrong!",Dredd

733,wendyw217,Highly impressed,9,30 October 2012,"A highly suspenseful and well-acted action/sci-fi movie, which fleshes the characters out well, and creates a dark, bleak, post-apocalyptic atmosphere that's totally tangible.I was very impressed with the acting, especially by Lena Headey in her role as Ma-Ma. I have only previously seen her in a romantic comedy and the change was remarkable. I think she deserves much recognition for her acting in this role. She fleshed out her character as evil, but also gave her solidity and a history. Personally, I think her acting in this role was the highlight of the movie for me. Other characters such as Judge Dredd and Anderson were also well acted.Also, the 3D rendering of the SLO-MO scenes and shooting scenes were excellent and gave the gore an artistic quality.Would definitely recommend. Go see it!",Dredd
734,ppmanguin,Excellent on 3D,9,11 June 2015,"Expected to get a crap movie with good 3D effects, but turns out the movie was so thrilling that 1 hour 30 minutes felt like 45 minutes.I thought and would have liked that the movie would wrap up with an even bigger plot or even begin with a background story about the characters or the world, so it definitely feels lacking in this area. The film is beautifully shot as with the surround audio. Makes for good viewing material for home theater setup. 3D in this movie is effective and not over the top. It is cleverly utilized thought out the movie and definitely adds to the depth and contrast of the picture. A must watch for 3D.Highly recommended for action fans.9/10",Dredd
735,smiffysan,Utterly Brilliant,10,9 February 2014,"I've been a Dredd fan for a long time and was bitterly disappointed with the Stallone version. Karl Urban totally nails this character in every way. He is the perfect Dredd. Violent and brooding with an air of menace. Cross him and you die, it's that simple. He plays the part so well that there is a palpable feel of a coiled spring beneath his mask. The brilliant and beautiful Olivia Thurlby as the rookie Anderson acts as a perfect foil for Dredd, yet there are fleeting moments of a tenderness he reveals when he treats her wounds. Lena Headey as Ma Ma is just fantastic, utterly without empathy for her fellow human beings, she plays the part so perfectly. Please please please let there be a sequel.",Dredd
736,benigroom,Watch the Sly version,3,20 December 2012,"Here comes Dredd. I was eagerly anticipating this reboot hoping for a darker, grittier version which would be closer to the comics than the flawed but fun Sylvester Stallone version. Karl Urban's previous roles haven't all been stellar (Doom anyone?) but as Bones in the reboot of Star Trek (which I wanted to hate but couldn't) he showed his best side and I was hoping for more of the same here. Add into the mix Lena Headey who has hit some high notes in her career, most notably as Cersei Lannister in the excellent Game of Thrones and we're looking at a great film in the making.But between the plot holes as big as Mega City 1, the 'why didn't they just....' and 'seriously?!?!?' moments the film fails in nearly every way. You could blame it all on the script but the acting is also terrible from the whole cast. Visually the film is uninspiring giving us some ultra violent scenes which seem to have been put there because they could and repeated shots of elevator workings; seriously they are in an elevator and have pressed a button, I can work out that they are moving and don't need to be shown the magic world of counterweights. Dreddtastic or dreddfull? (Sorry I had to)In summary the least dreadful Dredd you can imagine; give it a miss and watch the Sly version, it may be flawed but it's far less flawed than this reboot. IMDb 7.6 - My take 3/10",Dredd
737,mkadams2010,A Diamond Among Turds.,10,22 December 2012,"In the sea of cruddy comic book films this one is true to the book. I have been a Judge Dredd fan since the early 80's and was afraid to even think about seeing this one after the abysmal 1995 Film. I have steered clear of many of the more recent comic book movies after being forever disappointed. No Thor, Captain America, Avengers, Batman tickets, DVD's or even rentals for me. I'm tired of the stupid changes and idiotic plots. The comics are popular for a reason and don't need Directors, Writers or Actors adding their personal spin. Be true to the original. Dredd is violent, he is unlikeable, he is gritty and in this film he is just like the book. Hey Hollywood, here is how you treat a character.P.S. thanks for not showing his face.",Dredd
738,backdoorreviews,"Dredd 3D, a Raid:Redepmtion clone but that's a good thing.",7,22 December 2012,"Dredd is one the best action flicks to come out this year. This is not an overstatement, it really is that good. The stuff that goes on in this almost makes up for the garbage that was the original Judge Dredd. Two minutes into the movie I already it was better than the previous. I am a big comic fan but I've never read Judge Dredd; if they're anything like the movie I'll have to start reading. Dredd is the story of a futuristic society that is run rampant with crime. Judges are the enforcers of the law that dispense punishment on the spot. The main villain of the movie, Ma-Ma, is a crime lord & drug distributor that has taken over a 200 floor building. It's up to Judge Dredd & rookie/psychic Judge Anderson to bring down Ma-Ma and anyone else that stands in the way of the law.Dredd is almost a clone of The Raid:Redemption, this is not a knock on the film. On the contrary, it's a complement to the filmmakers. I loved The Raid and Dredd shares a lot of the same characteristics. It's a vertical action flick; set in a building, have to go up level by level defeating bad guys. It's basically a video game on the screen. The music is very similar in both movies with the edge going to The Raid. The action is non stop, brutal and very bloody. I loved every minute of it! This is what an action movie should be. The scenes where they show people getting high on Slo-mo are unreal, I really wish I could've seen it in 3D. This movie is truly a visual joy.Taking the helm of Judge Dredd is Karl Urban (spoiler) he's a better Dredd than Stallone. I'm not saying Urban will be nominated for any awards but he's good in what he does. I have to think that his face may be stuck in a permanent frown after being in this; it's his only facial expression. Like I said previously, I've not read the comics but I'm pretty sure Dredd never removes his helmet and he doesn't in the movie either. This is a big departure from the first one and really liked it.In a year of really good action movies, Dredd has earned spot in the top 3. If you're a fan of action flicks this is a definite must see. Trust me, it's nothing like the Stallone one and Rob Schneider is nowhere to be seen. If you liked The Raid you'll love Dredd.",Dredd
739,patriksjoman85,Not so much,4,23 December 2012,"My excitement about this film vanished quickly. Under the layer upon layer of special effects there is not much to be enjoyed and the film asks more questions than it answers. The characters are plain and you never really get to feel for any of them and Judge Dread almost feels like a parody. Yes he is supposed to be cold, almost machine like, but even the old Robocop made the viewer care for the character, this film does not. There is a bigger picture here that is almost totally overlooked. If the makers had spent more time with the society in which the film takes place, then I could perhaps overlook the boring characters. Unfortunately they did not, and thus here we are. It's a sad attempt to cash in on an old classic, and it shows.If you remember the film from 1995 with a sense of nostalgic joy then I suggest you stay clear, I wish I had.",Dredd
740,ericglbrth,This is the movie I wish Max Payne had been.,10,22 October 2013,"This was the ultra violent detective splatter action flick (with a steam punk setting) I had hoped for from Max Payne, even down to the raspy narrative of Dredd's voice. Even the story of a drug related murder investigation turned into a trapped in a high rise surrounded by people that want to kill the protagonists while they themselves kill their way to the top dog. Its a bullet ballet for this generation. The visuals screamed out and were bright yet gritty and realistic. The story was just straight forward and there to move you from one insane shootout to another. The slow-mo even was what I had wanted in Max Payne. The bullets penetrating in matrix style slow-mo. Bombs and all when the movie shows from the druggies POV, but they don't over use it or any other over the top elements for that matter. That's saying something for an 100 min long action flick. It blends all its visuals and F/x wonderfully. Fun movie.",Dredd

743,gznmember,Thoroughly Enjoyable,9,31 December 2012,"Superb film. I must profess that I didn't expect much from this movie initially - despite my healthy interest in the science-fiction genre the film's promotional material and disappointing reception left me doubtful of its worth. Nevertheless I took my chances and came out of the theatre extremely pleased with my decision. The directing work is excellent. Scenes are composed perfectly and shot well. I found the drug sequences to be especially memorable with the tasteful use of slow-motion effects and good editing. The pacing of the film is splendid as well; never once did I feel that the movie was boringly slow, nor too fast to catch vital information. Finally the special effects were also in my opinion outstanding, despite the film's relatively small budget as compared with recent major films such as the Avengers or TDKR. CGI scenes depicting the futuristic Mega City One and its huge mega-structures are impressive yet believable. Shootout scenes are also well done and weapons – ranging from high-tech police PDWs firing incendiary and explosive rounds to mounted heavy machine guns - are striking in their visual and audio effects. All these merits culminate in a film that is able to strike awe and wonderment as well as drive adrenaline-rushes during the many action sequences.I can't comment much about the acting but I found it to be in my uneducated opinion flawless. Judge Dredd is a convincing character and an all-round bad-ass, while Ma-Ma is portrayed rather well as the film's main villain. Meanwhile, Anderson is a good balance between a pretty face for eye candy and a butt-kicking character.Now comes my single complaint about this otherwise masterful work – the plot. While the several minor twists and few tense moments were able to keep me fully engaged throughout the film and made for a great viewing experience, the overall story suffers from a bad case of fridge logic. Plot holes abound, largely arising from the problematic element of Anderson's psychic abilities. In retrospect many plot sequences appear shaky once one questions why the character could not have just used her supernatural powers to solve a particular situation. Furthermore, the plot is almost entirely forgettable; the film doesn't leave you with a thought-provoking message, nor does it really explore any novel ideas (e.g the consequences of the world's radical justice system). But then again, this isn't a film that aims to do that, nor should anyone expect it to. Instead, the film's true value lies in its outstanding ability to entertain, and for this I humbly believe that it entirely deserves the 9/10 rating I bestow upon it.",Dredd
744,marlon-shakespeare-574-150922,Dredd but not as you know him,8,6 January 2013,"As you can see by my name I am a big Dredd fan, and was pretty upset at first at a new Dredd movie, the first was so bad I never wanted to see him on the silver screen again. Then information started to come through, and the first good news was that the film was going to be an 18, Dredd as a PG is like Aliens Vs Predator, may look like it but it won't be the same. Then the whole helmet staying on, this meant I was willing to give it a chance.Is this the dredd we Know, Karl Urban does a brilliant job, so yes.Is this the megacity 1 we love, not at all, but does that matter? My feelings are no, I am a massive fan of Spawn in all it's forms and as Todd MacFarlane says in a new media you have to expect it to be presented different. So as long as Dredd is Dredd what does it matter that Megacity 1 isn't the same. There's very little to dislike about this film, if you're a fan of dredd you'll love the way the story revolves around this emotionless law giving machine.The style and violence may put people off but no real Dredd fan would be upset, and I'm glad Anderson turns up as a rookie adding some humanity to the judges.",Dredd

Even the role of Mr. Urban could have been performed by a mutant. Lena Headay just shows again, she isn't well appointed for the movies. What a waste of time. But the colors and slow motions of this movie are fine. Everything is predictable, but a new highlight is born. The topic corruption has been put on the table, even in the future, just call ""911"".

This could have been any cop themed movie, and throwing the Judge angle on it was just a poor attempt to sell it and an insult to the fans. It wasn't very interesting, over half the movie was drug out. Had plenty of action, but nothing really impressive. Action sequences and special effects were no better than a low budget TV movie. All that said, I am a fan of Karl Urban though. Think he is a great actor who played his role in the movie fairly well. His co-partner in the movie is kind of hot too and did a decent job. There was more bad acting than good though.",Dredd
747,christopher-trenham,New to Review,6,1 January 2014,"Being a teenager, I have not had the experience or joy that most other people reviewing this film have had in growing up loving the character from comic books. However, my admiration for Dredd has come from watching the 1995 adaptation, starring Stallone, on many occasions. It is for me that this version is rather a disappointment in comparison. Being one who is not familiar with the accolades of Judge Dredd from the comics, I find that this film does not delve deep enough into the character. If it were not for my previous encounters with the world of Dredd, I would feel that many may have been lost as to why this character is so important compared to other 'street judges'.However, with the lack of character depth aside this film is visually stunning with special effects that really grasp onto the idea of a futuristic dystopia. The choice to remove elements of science-fiction, such as floating vehicles and such only enhances the plausibility of the situation. The combat and action sequences fulfill every persons wanting for violence in true edge-of-your-seat fashion, bringing some amazingly detailed slow-motion cinematography.In conclusion, what this film falls short on in character depth and perception, it well makes up for in amazing visual elements that draw your eye to the detail of the world. For the die-hard Judge Dredd fans, this film is worth the watch.",Dredd
748,jm-levasseur,Bit disappointed,6,14 January 2013,"Despite the general rating, I would only give this movie a 6.If you're looking for a good action movie, where all the scenes take place in a building, watch The Raid Redemption. I highly recommend it.If you're looking for a good Judge Dredd movie (I admit they were only two), watch the 1995's version.The only good surprise comes from the rookie Judge Anderson, very well played by Olivia Thirlby. I had the feeling anyone could play Dredd on this one, so empty he was.To be honest the action movie really started after one hour. Music became good, then. Finally some action! Realisation is clean, nothing to say, but, the scenario lacks of intensity. It's just really flat. Actually it looks like a TV movie with the CGI we could be expecting from a 2015 TV movie. Even if they where somewhat new, I admit. Just badly arranged, in my opinion.SF and comic fans can give it a try, the others may be disappointed.

749,steve-wisn,A good Judge Dredd movie is still yet to be made,4,17 January 2013,"This movie is stunningly unimaginative, particularly when you think about the insanely rich source material. The only difference between the future world of Dredd and any current run-down metropolis is the Dredd-world has the mile-high apartment blocks -- come on, with millions of $$ of budget at your disposal you can't do more than unfinished concrete? And let's bring back hundreds of 1980's cars and vans, which somehow are the only vehicles that managed to a survive the Apocalypse. Add to this a citizenry that dresses like they just came out of low-rent gym (tee-shirts, hoodies, nylon shorts, jeans) and you've got a future that looks exactly like today.Things CHANGE. 50 years ago people did not wear hoodies. 50 years from now (or 100 years, or 500 years, whenever it's supposed to be), people will be wearing something different than what they are wearing now. It doesn't have to be silver lame like in a fifties sci-fi flick, but it does have to be DIFFERENT. Everything has to be different. My God, look at Blade Runner. THAT was a world. The Megacity 1 of Dredd is a pedestrian attempt at future metropolitan decay that looked exactly like current metropolitan decay. This made the movie kind of suck right out of the gate. I didn't believe we were anywhere except inside an ugly building.To be truthful, the entire movie looked EXACTLY like ""The Raid - Redemption."" AND the entire movie had basically the plot -- and the same action! -- as The Raid - Redemption.Raid-Redemption was made in 2011 and Dredd was made in 2012. Draw any conclusion you wish. (Watch Raid-Redemption and get your Action Mind blown.) The other thing that got me was the idea that slow-motion makes for excitement in an ""action movie."" To start with, we've got no eyes (due to the Judge's masks) hence no feeling; no expression in voices; no body language; and no interesting visual backdrop to the shooting (I'm going to call it ""shooting"" instead of ""action"" because that's all it was); so, to top it off, let's put a bunch of it in slow motion, let's have a drug that MAKES us experience ""the action"" in slow motion. Wow, the excitement is giving me a heart attack.A good Judge Dredd movie is still yet to be made.",Dredd
750,mojaprop,"A brilliant start, let's have some more",10,11 July 2013,"As a long term fan of 2000ad from the first edition up to the 90's I loved this film. It's everything the Stallone abortion isn't. Make no mistake this was a hard task from the start and Urban nails Dredd. with Dredd less is more and actions speak louder than words. In the 1980's when the idea of making a film of Dredd was first discussed, everyone agreed on 2 points, ! it should not be Stallone and 2. the actor should not remove his helmet, Really the film should have been made in the early 80's with Clint Eastwood as Dredd, Dredd is essentially a future ""dirty"" Harry Calaghan ( and then some).The film isn't perfect but it is perfectly acceptable and has left me wanting more. How about a two parter? Block Mania followed by Apocalypse War... More Dredd please and quickly.",Dredd
751,kalavan,It is no an action movie.,1,21 February 2013,"I was curious what action would this film show me. And after viewing it I must tell - almost none. I haven't seen there any great shooting nor fight scenes. I couldn't find there any parts of ""action film humor"" I am always eager to hear in films like that. I must tell that ""Judge Dredd (1995)"" was even better comparing to this one. I am surprised but I must tell that 17 year old movie was somehow equal if not better in means of special effects. Surely there was more science-fiction there.Och and plot. Simple, there was nothing that could surprise you. And I wouldn't say anything about it if I didn't have a feeling that I've seen it before, much better made. All plot with building was totally ripped from ""The raid"" movie - same story, same building.",Dredd

Re-shoot the film and have the main actor take off his helmet once in a while during the filming. Also add a few more scenes with the actual plot and story line.

753,stainlessfightsu,Comicbook Movie done right.,10,2 March 2013,"This Judge Dredd is deserved of a 10/10. The high recommendation is qualified by comparison to other films in the genera. The characters were believable within the viewers suspended disbelief of the dystopian future setting. The gun play was tight. Continuity was great. Story predictable yet satisfying. One liners were amusing, and well timed. Hyper violence was very beautiful, coupled with the drug use/special effects. Special effects are top notch, and seamless. I regret not seeing this movie in theaters. It was strongly recommended to me, but I delayed viewing it.Bonus: the viewers intelligence is not insulted, or is common ignorance of a general viewer placated too = Meaning: this movie does not waste time with a lot of bullshit setup and explanation. Opening credit short explanation. This movie plays to a viewer that wants to see Judge Dredd, and needs not waste time bringing everyone else up to speed.",Dredd

All tho it dose not stick to the futerisct view of the old it dose in my view hold to the stander you expect when doing a movie of this style. The cast bring there own play on the chartricers of this hard depressed world were the only really way to make an honest buck is to lay down with the crime, where true law is hard to come by in the vast mega-city that now cover most of America. Only the judge's can rule on crime but as the movie shows in these hard time's even the law can't help in some case it put in to light the flaws of the modern world and how if not controlled we will end up in a smiler stay ourselves. If not for the fact that i usually hate remake's and praise new and aredunal ideas i would have rate this at a nine for the fact off some very good action sense and that all the cast portrait there charticers very well.now on the matter of visual effect all tho there are some not what i would have like to see form a movie, like this but when they do they go to a level that you could believe unlike some movies where they go to extremes just because they can. My personal apointen is that the director got the balance of a good action film that stays in the realm of yes this could happen in the world if we had a major WMD go off. If we survive a war like that, and i would comment on the music but also unlike most movies where the music seems to have had all the money put soul on that this dose not in fact i don't think there was any.yes i know there were some small spelling mistake's sorry",Dredd
755,quarazy,"Disappointing, no depth",5,15 April 2013,"This movie reminded me of The Raid: Redemption due, obviously, to the very similar plot. The plot of fighting up a tower is nothing new, which means a twist is expected. There was no twist though; the movie was just a cookie-cutter with too many plot holes.First, how does a woman who possesses psychic abilities fail any exam? Early on, she knew that Kay was going to attempt to take Dredd's gun, but he still manages to take her gun. She reads Cathy's mind, but needs to see a family picture before she realizes the connection with the man she killed. There are other cases where her powers stop making sense. I can only think of three cases when Anderson really takes advantage of her ability.The block was reportedly very high in crime, but the control representatives were comfortable enough to allow the gang to take over the building. Is the judicial system in the future supposed to be incompetent? Later, when Dredd is able to make contact with control again, he doesn't request the defense system to be raised. Backup just stands outside for an hour. I would imagine that's key information to pass on. At the end, Ma-Ma puts up a very weak defense. Why doesn't she also have a self-trigger to blow up the building rather than just relying on the inadequate detonator? I don't expect a brilliant plot from an action movie. I expect action but that wasn't great either, partially because it made no sense. The gang possessed three machine guns, capable of piecing through multiple concrete walls. They decide the best way to use these three weapons is by shooting in parallel lines, so Dredd could escape by running in one direction. The weapon the judges use is like a child's toy and the action scenes played out similarly. Maybe that just has to do with the comics, so I won't trash it. Dredd had the opportunity to stockpile on dozens of guns, but he chose to run out of ammo. He is made to be an almost unstoppable character, but his skill wholly revolves around on vocalizing his types of weapons. If I had to pick, the best action sequence was the raid scene where they pick up Kay. To say that that was the best scene is something.The acting overall was very wooden. It's not the fault of the actors though; there just was no opportunity to act well and that was a factor in the character development. I couldn't have cared less on if any of the characters died. I wanted to hate a villain or root for the good guys but couldn't. I do not recommend this movie to anyone.",Dredd

I know because back in 81 I watched Blade Runner blown away dazzled and then scratched my head in puzzlement when everybody was slagging off BR and gushing about about ET the Extraterrestrial. .Now everybody is gushing over the Avengers and Iron man while quality cult movies like Dredd are passed over and sniffed at .Just wait , it took about 10 years for the Blade Runner fan base to break out and spill over into the mainstream , Dredd is too good for that not to happen.",Dredd

759,simonjohntaylordyda,A Dredd Worth Seeing,8,9 July 2013,"I've been a fan of Judge Dredd since I bought my first copy of the comic 2000 AD in 1979 at the tender age of 6. Dredd is the first movie adaptation of the comic strip to get it right, and Karl Urban's portrayal of the anti-character is flawless, a welcome relief for all Dredd fans who suffered through the gaudy travesty of Danny Cannon's 1995 movie starring Rocky Balboa.I was pleased to see on a recent trip to the supermarket that Dredd is still in the Top 20 of DVDs in the UK. I'm sure all hardcore Dredd fans will be crossing their fingers in the hope that DVD sales do well enough to fund a sequel, because when it came to the box office, Dredd shot itself in the foot. Why the people behind the movie thought it was a good idea to go 3D-only, I just don't know. I went to see it despite the fact it was in 3D, not because of it, and I still had to wait for the 2D DVD release before I could actually see what the hell was going on. This whole 3D fad is a case of Hollywood thinking that ""the public wants what the public gets"". It's the bleedin' 1980s all over again. 3D wasn't a good idea back then and it still isn't now.Anyway, back to the movie. Following its release in theatres I noticed that a lot of so-called ""critics"" thought it clever to compare the film to The Raid (Gareth Evans, 2011) because both films involve the bloody ascent of a tower block. 'Oh yeah, Dredd,' they'd say. 'It's basically The Raid set in the future but with less choreography.' This is like saying that LA Confidential (Curtis Hanson, 1997) is basically To Live And Die In LA (William Friedkin, 1985) set in the past, because both films involve cops, corruption and Los Angeles. To make such a comparison is supremely lazy. I watched The Raid shortly before I first saw Dredd, and at no point did I think any such comparison was justified.Dredd is violent, gritty, deadpan, full of impressive special effects, visually stunning (well, in 2D at any rate) and is everything hardcore Dredd fans were hoping for.",Dredd
760,mampapz,"Poor, poor story",6,25 September 2013,"I really like the old movie and really hoped that this one was in the same league, but far from. the story was very thin, the hole movie should have been the intro. And i think that at some point you should see who is under the helmet of Dreed, but you don't. And Karl Urban doesn't have the same coolness as Stallone has in the old movie. The bikes they have in the new movie is just so lame compared to the old movie's bikes. and the guns the Dreed has in the new movie is not as cool as the old one either..But if you doesn't have seen the old movie and u don't have too high expectations as i did then and need a time-killer then its a okay movie, because there is some good action screens.",Dredd

762,dominicborrett333,Surprisingly Good,7,14 August 2013,"Stallone's portrayal of Dredd did little for audiences when released in 1995 and because of that I didn't hold high hopes when a remake was announced. But I was pleasantly surprised with Karl Urban and his rookie sidekick, although it shows limited dialogue and minimal story telling the film makes up for it with the sheer amount of gore, violence and awesome one liners usually followed by the former. I think the comic book fanatics that so desperately craved a decent Dredd movie in 1995 can at least be satisfied with this update on a dull original.The movie worked because the team behind the movie used only what they had to from the comics and didn't get caught up in a painfully slow story line. Dredd could quite easily become a comic book fan's bread and butter and people may begin to question a possible sequel...",Dredd
763,Nuclearzorro,Fantastic,10,6 September 2013,"This film hits the nail on the head when it comes to an accurate portrayal of Judge Dredd. Karl Urban plays the character exactly how he was meant to be. The story is set perfectly to show a normal on the job day for Dredd. This film knocked the bad taste out of my mouth that Sly and Rob left me with when they tried and failed to make a Judge Dredd movie. Besides Karl's dead on rendition of Dredd, Olivia Thirbly's Judge Anderson almost stole show with her whit and skills. The way she and Dredd seemed to sync up and kill the baddies showed that Dredd does in fact have a small soft spot. This movie was poorly advertised and unless you were already aware of it's existence you probably didn't see it until it was released on video. I highly recommend viewing/supporting this film so we will have the opportunity, hopefully in the near future, to see later installments of what could be the best rated R comic book franchise to hit the market.",Dredd

About the plot, it is just an ordinary day in job - no history of the character, nothing unnecessary. Just action!Karl Urban really surprised me with his acting - a fantastic performance! Really suitable for this role. I knew that Lena Headey is a very nice actress and she proves it once again in this film. Olivia Thirlby also gives a remarkable ''rookie'' performance.I believe that this Dredd deserves a sequel, with the same attitude and for sure Karl Urban as Dredd.

It starts of with a bang and ends with a bang, the middle is bang on too. You see, when I first saw Dredd I was like 'Whoa' then when I saw it again I was like ""Frrkkk!"", it was that awesome. Dredd wears a gun like a cowboy and he shoots like one too, you can see him point the gun and shoot before the other guy has a chance to dodge, causing him to get killed. This movie is like a hen that laid a golden egg, except you can eat the egg too. The cool thing about dredd is that he never takes off his helmet, it makes him mysterious. It's like if he ever wanted to take it off he couldn't because he can't, it has become a part of him. Great film!!!",Dredd
767,edwinlavin0,Final verdict: Dredd is the law.,9,18 December 2013,"For me Dredd is a movie that brought back memories of sneaking a copy of Conan the Barbarian or Robocop for a late night viewing, those ultra- violent classics, entertainment for the grownups with toothy ideas driving the engine. Dredd gives us another example of a genre film that embraces it's R rating, a rare event these days, maybe because only the really good project make it through the minefield of corporate indecision and make it to production. When it does we get Panic Room or Sin City, what they call high concept pictures that hit the brain like sugar on a sweet tooth, Dredd already belongs on a list among those hollowed titles.Like all good movies it has it's share of proponents and detractors, and an active debate among them, some would argue it's an overrated exploitation film, worthy of failure, lacking subtly in both character and setting, guilty of indulgence in violence. I throw in with the side that hails this film as an instant classic. Dredd works for a number of reasons, for one it keeps the screenplay is air tight, the opening starts with the main character and his true enemy, the city itself, and goes from there. His relationship with the rookie is a wonderful tool for unpacking the world around them. The plot escalates more and more and resolves itself satisfyingly, leaving most audiences wanting more. The elements that make up this story: the Hero, the Villein, the Mission, all are subverted, and at the same time played straight. Everything is turned on it's head, where the law has to make hard compromises and the bad guys are a consequence of their society. In this world of ambiguity the only thing a person can trust is what they see in front of them, that's why Dredd climbs that Megabloc, because it's how operates. This movie only scratches the surface of what the franchise has to offer. Does it deserve a sequel? You bet it does.",Dredd
768,replayre,a McRehash of Raid:Redemption,4,11 February 2013,"Not good, a mindless sensationalism of violence. I had no interest in any of the characters, so that proved actors like Urban, Harris and Headey had their talents wasted. The myopic scope of setting, the movie completely unfolded within the slum high rise, is a metaphor for the limited creativity of the filmmakers. It's yet another example, like the reincarnation of Total Recall and worse, of how modern movie producers have lost any ability to relate to a humane audience.This is the junk food of cinema. There is manufactured content here, but like french fries, you'll be worse off for having consumed it. A point Sean Penn made when he said that movies should leave the viewer better than before they watched it. Movies like Dredd devalue life and in the most unsatisfying of ways. This is a little death of culture, and by little, I mean small impact, but all negative.A few side notes, Urban channels Stallone for his facial expressions, and Eastwood for his voice. As in, an uninspired lead performance to helm an uninspired offering. And a note to the director, having the characters figure out how to be more efficiently bad-ass doesn't count as building audience interest in your characters.",Dredd

I know it didn't smash the box office but surly the moneys coming in on DVD, Love Film etc? It was so so much better than that crap 90's film with sly in. Chalk and cheese really!

772,eternal_pariah86,THIS is the Dredd movie we have all been waiting for!,10,21 June 2014,"OK, before I begin, I just want to state that I have never read all that much of the Dredd comics and whatnot. I just liked Judge Dredd as a character and a symbol. A symbol of the kind of law enforcement and crime-punishment that is needed so badly in our society. He is a bad-ass ""cop"" who deals out justice and gets results. A real no-nonsense, punisher of evil. So, naturally, I took to Dredd as a symbol of sorts. The first Judge Dredd movie that came out in the mid 90's was a complete JOKE. Then again, anything with Rob Schneider in it is doomed to mockery and failure. Anyway, back on the subject at hand, THIS Dredd movie is what it should have been all along! First, whoever casted Karl Urban as Judge Dredd deserves a promotion or at least a pay raise, because not once during the entirety of the film did I ever see the ACTOR. All I could see was the CHARACTER, Dredd, and he brilliantly lived up to how I always imagined he should be. I didn't even really notice the alterations to the body armor the judges wear. Everything just seemed realistic and natural, this time around. Lena Heady as the brutal drug lord, Ma-Ma, was also a perfect cast. The movie has the same set-up as The Raid (another great movie, by the way) of going into a gang-controlled apartment complex and arrest/kill the leader and get back out safely. Anyway, I think I have stated my case for why I love this movie. Now stop reading and go watch it! :)",Dredd

774,adwodon,A proper action movie.,8,14 January 2015,"Ask yourself, do you like action movies?If the answer is yes then do yourself a favour and check this film out. Much like The Raid it has a very simple set up, 'good' guys trapped in a tower block and must fight their way out however it differentiates itself well with its style of action, rather than martial arts, we have a more gun and gadget focused brutality on display here with well done special effects and some nice slow mo that cut a significant height above most other action films, the action here packs a punch.There are a lot of nice things sprinkled in, a great dystopia, good characters, along with a really strong performance from Karl Urban but the good thing is that these are merely icing, they don't distract from the action, they enhance it.It's certainly not a perfect film but when the action genre is so often diluted into spectacle films which tack an extra hour onto their run time to attempt (and often fail) to get you to relate to their characters or set up some ludicrously convoluted plot its nice to see some film makers have the balls to take a simple genre concept and run with it.",Dredd
775,mrcuperchino,"Went in as an earnest supporter, came out wanting a better movie",5,29 September 2012,"I really wanted to like this movie and had been dying to see it since opening day, especially after reading through the rave reviews on this board. After watching it with my brother, I have to unfortunately conclude that the box office reception does accurately reflect the quality of the movie. I don't think the proposed explanations: unfamiliarity with Dredd, discrepancies between the trailer and actual movie, or moviegoer ignorance and poor taste have anything to do with the poor sales. The movie simply underperforms in many aspects.Without spoiling any of the plot - There are some highlights. I think Karl Urban and Olivia Thirlby were well-casted for their roles as Dredd and his sidekick Anderson. Dredd's deadpan humor and Anderson's maturation grow on you over the course of movie. They both start out as dull, single-dimensional characters that you don't particularly empathize with, so this adds a lot to the sense of progress in the movie. In particular, Dredd's consistency with laying down the law is interspersed with subtle moments of moral relativism. He rigidly sentences criminals and is constantly enforcing strict standards on Anderson, but set aside the tough words and you see a lot of humanity and flexibility in his actions. By the end of the movie, you really get to like the guy.All the other judges are also really well casted, and their interactions are a savory highlight of the movie.Now to the bad -There are also some severe miscasts, including Lena Headey as the main baddie, Ma-Ma, and Wood Harris as his primary henchman. Lena Headey is inconsistent as she vacillates between psychotic (in flashbacks) and incompetent/completely ineffective (in the main plot). She doesn't have a commanding presence in her major scenes and her authority feels artificially driven by the script. Wood Harris is equally ineffective, because you NEVER get the sense that he is as scary as he is supposed to be. In fact, the whole premise of the movie is pretty much driven by him NOT being a badass.Moving past the characters, there are also significant pacing issues with the movie. The use of the futuristic narcotic Slo-mo in various action scenes is overdone and really detracts from the shock and weight of certain events. It was cool for the first-time, but too many scenes are relayed in slow-motion, and for too long. Also, the major fight scenes (excluding that of the judges) feel laborious. They're completely one-sided, flat in terms of progress and suspense, and feel way too isolated and detached from the primary plot. It's as if half the fights were just stuck into random parts of the movie without any particular attention to strategy or purpose, reminiscent of TV sci-fi more than a well-planned action movie. It's your typical single-set fight scene with a bunch of anonymous, hand-my- ass-to-me bad guys. I found myself yawning and restless during a couple of these scenes and I am a pretty patient movie watcher.Dredd could have been many things - a great action movie, a nice take on cyberpunk, a creative and intellectual exploration of justice in the future - but comes up short on too many fronts. It ends up, in my opinion, being barely okay.",Dredd
776,BrianDowns19,Great,10,15 February 2015,"This movie was great because it hit everything that was expected of it. All the key requirement points of the first one, sex, blood, violence, and gore were met extremely well for the era that it was released in. Its the best R rated action movie we've had in a long time. If you just want to see some gratuitous violence and badassery for 95 minutes this is it! Personally I want another one with Olivia Thirlby as the same character being even more bad ass with the notion of experience. Also Karl Urban as Judge Dredd was a great choice. You really get that same Sylvester Stallone feel as he plays through the roll. I definitely recommend the watch! thumbs up! wheres the next one?!

The storyline is basic and straight forward, no major 'Star Wars' style special effects. And do you know what? It's a lot better for it. I knew I was in for a better experience when I saw the word 'Drokk' on a character's jacket in one of the first scenes. They have kept true to the comics in the way things are portrayed than I could have ever hoped, from the randomness of the citizens to the way Dredd's face is not revealed at any point during the movie.A really good attempt this movie is.

Action from start to finish and violence. Stallone was so bad in the first go around that Urban didn't get a fair shot. The box office bombed but when people actually saw it they loved it. The sequel would be a huge success.,Dredd

781,danair-24971,Best of the old and new.,10,23 August 2020,"As things progress and the way society as a whole has changed, this has allowed for a more believable adaption of Dredd to the big screen. Unlike the 95 version which had a good comic book feel to rhe sets but the wrong person for Dredd. Dredd 3d pushed all the right buttons, expanding on today with just a little push to show how we could find ourselves in Dredds world. Well .ade and fast moving action with a good story. The only negative would be the 3d, its a gimmick that was not needed. This should be a starter for a new franchise.",Dredd
782,marcussebastiangunnarsson,Dull,5,3 November 2018,"Extremely one dimensional, no character development, un-imaginative.There is nothing to it, watch 10 minute of this non stop (poorly executed) action and you have seen the whole movie.",Dredd
783,jdilab,"Dredd: If it's in 3D, why so flat?",5,24 September 2012,"The comparisons between Dredd 3D and The Raid: Redemption will be commonplace. Having seen both, I have to say my loyalty lies with the energetic, fun Indonesian film rather than the flat, too-serious Dredd.That's not to say Dredd is a complete dog. Karl Urban (or at least his chin) is fine as the titular character, a one man judicial system in Mega City One. He works the streets of this futuristic dystopia (aren't they all) where the new drug SLO-MO is ravaging the already downtrodden populace. Joined at Dredd's side is Anderson (Olivia Thirlby) a new recruit with her own unique abilities. It's Dredd's job to asses Anderson's skill and together they unwittingly run into the gang behind the SLO-MO plague. Urban's acting skills are not strained here, being mostly contained to spouting one liners but he is convincing as the titular bad-ass. Thirlby plays the standard partner role. It's not a bad performance but nothing special. Their foil is Ma-Ma (Lena Headey), a former prostitute turned crime boss. She has taken over the Mega Tower known as Peach Trees, a 200 story monolith that she controls through fear and the occasional triple homicide. Headey is by far the best part of the movie, playing a villain who has perhaps taken her own product a few too many times. Once Ma-Ma seals Dredd and Anderson inside, it's up to them to fight their way out.I'm not usually a fan of 3D but the effect is used well. The same can be said for the SLO-MO effect. Visually Dredd is quite nice. Director Pete Travis definitely doesn't go over the top with these techniques. The same cannot be said with the violence. This movie earns its 18A rating: bullets pierce every body part, baddies fly over railings and yes, head shots galore. It's definitely a bleak world in Peach Trees. I'm not a violence prude but I think a little levity could have helped the proceedings. The fate of a homeless character is especially cruel in a movie with little humour towards it's violent content.As I said Travis does well with the CGI techniques but the same cannot be said in his shooting of action scenes. Everything seems slow and flat. The fact that most of Dredd's enemies are nameless thugs lends to the carnival like ""shoot the ducks"" atmosphere to the whole movie. Bad guys pop up and Dredd shoots/stuns/immolates them; lather, rinse, repeat.The script did not help Travis. Alex Garland's screenplay is fairly mundane, and most action buffs will not be surprised by his attempted swerves. It's also rough story wise. A potential side plot involving Anderson and one of Peach Trees' residents is introduced then discarded. This is surprising considering Garland penned the fabulous 28 Days Later.Overall I just found the story to be too serious, this is supposed to be a fun action film after all. Perhaps this was an attempt to distance itself from Stallone's 1995 Judge Dredd. They may also have been an attempt to be faithful to the source material. I'm not a fan of the comics so I can't comment on that, but it just seemed a bit too joyless for me. So here we have a movie with decent acting, good visuals, over the top violence but so so action staging and a ho-hum script. It's definitely a mixed bag that will probably entertain fans of the comic but few others. Thanks for reading! JD",Dredd
784,johanpaulsson-68491,A total waist of time,1,12 March 2019,"This is by far one of the worst movies I've
seen in many years. Total crap and what a waist of time. The Mama character is so terrible. It doesn't get any more aweful than this. Super bad acting in general.",Dredd
785,theguynameddan,Not Good,4,5 July 2013,"Judge Dredd is a very cool character. I really enjoyed the Sylvester Stallone version, although it lacked in certain areas. I watched this version because I figured it would be a more modern take of the Dredd Universe, and not have as much cheese as the older one. I was so very disappointed at the lack of creativity that this movie displayed. I got extremely bored of all of the head shots, ridiculous violence, and walking down apartment complex hallways. This was a complete waste of my time. It had a lot of potential, but completely blew it. BUT, if you like to see anything that moves have its head shot off, and you also like to watch emotionless law enforcement officers walk down hallways, over and over and over, then this movie is probably perfect for you.",Dredd
786,danielhaas-34063,Amazing Effects and Animations,8,11 March 2018,I love this movie in 3D!They have a lot of scenes filmed with Phantom High FPS Cameras and these look just increddible.When they take the slowmo drug everything seems like a super slow mo wonderland.Love the movie just because of the awesome effects. Worth watching.,Dredd
787,hkl_fan,"Much Better then I expected it to be. Great action, great effects. Will get it on Blu Ray when it is released.",8,20 September 2012,"Dredd 3D is a very good reboot of the Judge Dredd movie franchise. Karl Urban, (the new Dr. McCoy in Star Trek) takes over from Sylvester Stallone in the title role. Urban does a great job and makes Dredd seem more imposing then Stallone was able to.The movie is very much like Die Hard or The Raid. Dredd and his new partner (Olivia Thirlby) go to a super structure building (the movie is set in the future) to investigate a possible homicide. When an arrest is made the building is locked down and a bounty is put on the two Judges. Lena Headey (Sarah Connor from the Sarah Connor TV show) plays Ma Ma the leader of the building. Ma Ma locks down the building and orders the Judges killed. Headey is a violent killer that takes action into her own hands assassinating entire gangs that get in her way. Ma Ma is a great villain and a good match against Dredd.Thirlby (Dredds sidekick) is great as an in-confident rookie Judge. Thirlby's character is psychic. She can read the thoughts and enter the minds of others. Thirlby's character gets stronger and more confident throughout the movie and is a joy to watch. I hope to see her in more action movies.The 3D is very good especially in the 'slo mo' scenes. Slo Mo is a popular drug that lets the user believe time is running at 1 / 100th of a second. This makes for great super slow motion effects that are also shown in 3D. I am not a fan of 3D but these scenes worked well. I would prefer the Tron Legacy approach of only having the effects scenes in 3D, but the 3D is better here then most of the other movies I have seen.",Dredd

789,sempur,Police State Propaganda,1,15 September 2013,"So, we're supposed to cheer for a police force that runs around, knocking down doors, and blasting bowl smoking teenagers in the face? Yeah, f@*& 'em, they live in the slums. But, you know what would be better? If the police could just read everyone's thoughts - it would be so much less violent if they could just jump in peoples heads and leave them a crumpled pile pissing themselves in the corner. If it's so bad to drug people and throw them off buildings, how is Judge Dredd a hero? Glad he could rid the city of a scourge of people experiencing rainbow colors and time in slow motion. F*&! this movie, and f*/&! you if you were dumb enough to cheer for it.",Dredd
790,Meadowsala,So much you can't un-see....,1,18 January 2013,"Okay, I went through so much just trying to get to the place to actually write a review, because this movie has been so acclaimed by users, and I have to let someone know that there's still intelligent life on this planet. As a comic book fan, I hated it, as a woman, I hated it, as a moviegoer who spent money to see it, I hated it- are you seeing a pattern??? It had absolutely nothing going for it. How this has been called a great film is completely beyond me. It's gaping flaws are, to name a few: 1. Awful, painfully drawn-out slow motion effects, coupled with mind-numbing theme music to them, that seriously after the first couple were overdone. 2. Way, way too much blood splattering everywhere- from the misshapen heads to tattered edges of wounds, it was just gross. I've seen vampire movies where the storyline CENTERS on blood and they didn't have that much volume, scene for scene. 3. We're all adults, people. Do you have to hear the ""f"" bomb so many times in a sentence to remind yourself? Slews of profanities & shock scenes (hello, soft core & torture porn people, this is a comic book movie- please refrain from taking over every genre with your schlock) do not an intriguing story make. 4. The plot, while promising, was too weak to hold up against the backdrop of the excessively bleak & ultimately not convincing world they tried to formulate with just a few scenes. That world should have been a tad more developed, if just one of the slow-motion scenes could have run several minutes shorter, or the depraved flashbacks been sacrificed for its sake. This movie is added to the list of things I cannot un-see, and time I will never get back. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone. At all.",Dredd
