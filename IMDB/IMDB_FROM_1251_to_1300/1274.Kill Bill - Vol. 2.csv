0,MartinHafer,"Very good, but not as much like ""Kill Bill: Vol.1"" as I expected.",9,13 February 2010,"I was very surprised when I saw this film, as I expected a movie that was roughly a continuation of what I'd seen in ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"". And, while the story does continue, the style and pace are very different--almost as if the follow-up was made by a different film maker. Now this does NOT mean that either is a bad film--it's just that ""Vol. 2"" is so very different. I think the body count in ""Vol. 1"" was about 1792134935947523 more or less, but in the second film very few people actually died--and very few at the hands of Uma Turman's character. In addition, the pacing is much slower and the music is good, but much more sedate--and it's very drawn out and deliberately paced. Personally, I prefer the first film--even if there is less depth to the story and many things are unanswered. In the second film, there is more story and depth to the characters--but it's less stylish and intense.Now I could discuss the plot or describe all I liked or didn't like about the film. However, there are already a butt-load of reviews for this film--too many to make any additional comments I could make particularly important. The bottom line is that the two films together make for an incredible viewing experience--but not one you really want to show to your children or mother-in-law!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
1,Leofwine_draca,"Plenty of cult material, although it's not quite as memorable as the first",6,10 August 2016,"Tarantino's hit sequel sees him taking the KILL BILL mythos in new and unexpected directions, with a non-linear plot that keeps you guessing all the while, elements of romance that are entirely unexpected, and a whole range of genres mixed together into one mildly satisfying and well-gelled whole. The film seems full of suspense, but the focus is on character here rather than action, as in the last movie, and it's a trick that works well; a simple repeat of the gory chaos seen in KILL BILL VOL. 1 may have been entertaining, but it would have been old ground, whereas this volume offers a different experience than before. Thurman has settled into her character now and her strong role model provides a pivot around which the rest of the story flows; stealing all of his scenes is David Carradine as the charismatic, strangely likable arch-villain Bill. Support comes from an excellent Michael Madsen (the best performance I've seen him give yet) and Daryl Hannah as an extremely dangerous assassin.Although this film only contains three death scenes, it is very violent and gruesome. People are bitten by poisonous snakes and die graphically; eyeballs are popped from their sockets and the swordplay doesn't let up. There are many old exploitation/kung fu actors here, as well as Carradine; Bo Svenson pops up as a preacher, whilst the reliable Sid Haig has a cameo as a barman. Gordon Liu turns up again after his appearance as one of the Crazy 88 in the first movie, this time as kung fu stereotype Pai Mei, the old grumpy mentor who shows Thurman the ropes in some hilariously over-the-top training sequences. Others also appear, like a shadowy Samuel Jackson, making this a pleasing ""spot the actor"" viewing experience. For cult film fans, there's a whole slew of references, with nods at everything from spaghetti westerns to martial arts flicks, including loads of music tracks taken from some classics and some not-so-classics (including a great score from an Italian '70s polizia flick). At the end of the day, this is a film that offers up a pretty much well-rounded experience, offering all the violence, tension, and coolness that you've come to expect from a Tarantino flick, plus a whole lot more besides.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
2,SnoopyStyle,Not as great as hoped for but still a very good watch,7,2 May 2014,"Beatrix Kiddo (Uma Thurman) is the bride. She tracks down Budd (Michael Madsen) but he takes her down first. He puts her in a coffin and buries her. Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) double crosses Budd and kills him. Beatrix manages to escape and finds Elle in Budd's trailer. They have a knock down fight. Afterwards the only one left is Bill (David Carradine). There are also flashbacks to the wedding rehearsal before the massacre and Beatrix's training with master Pai Mei.It's slightly less compelling than part 1. Part 1 is bookended with 2 amazing fight scenes with lots of action in between. Part 2 really only has the great fight between Beatrix And Elle in its middle. The training segment is a bit of fun. The ending with Bill is somewhat a letdown. Quentin Tarantino should have realized that the girl is a great opportunity to subvert the traditional innocent girlie character. But that opportunity is lost here. The whole Last Chapter is a little too much talk and not enough action. Considering the first part ended with the big fight with O-Ren Ishii, this part ends with something less.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
3,claudio_carvalho,Disappointing and Overrated Sequel,6,23 August 2004,"After killing O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), The Bride chases Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle (Daryl Hanna). Then, she finds Bill (David Carradine), where a surprise waits for her. The second part of Kill Bill is a disappointing and overrated sequel. The reason and the massacre in the Texas church are finally presented and is the best part of this volume 2. The first part (Vol. 1) of this story was full of action and very funny, but there is too much comic book cheap philosophy talk and a corny conclusion in this second part.  In Brazil, `Kill Bill Vol. 2' has not been released in the movie theaters yet. I saw it in an imported DVD and I really did not like it, since I expected much more from Quentin Tarantino. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): `Kill Bill Vol. 2'",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
4,classicsoncall,"""I am gonna kill Bill"".",10,1 October 2011,"There's probably no better mission statement for a picture's leading character than the one uttered by Uma Thurman in the opening scene - ""I am gonna kill Bill"". From there, the story takes us back to the wedding rehearsal at Two Pines, and introduces us to the title character who never even showed up for the first installment except by his off screen presence, and the violence directed at his former Kiddo. Thinking about it now, that was a clever ploy used by director Tarantino. I recall being a bit disappointed that there was no Bill in Volume I when I first saw the picture, but now it comes across as more effective story telling. Of the two films, I prefer this second installment. The over the top violence of the first movie is a take it or leave it sort of proposition for me, it's not the first thing I'm looking for when I go in for a story like this. I'd much rather get into the character development and the motivations for why characters respond the way they do.It's clear that director Tarantino has a genuine affection for the genres he parodies here - Seventies martial arts flicks, spaghetti Westerns and comic book super-heroes. Bill's (David Carradine) monologue on Superman's identity and alter-ego seemed to come out of nowhere, but perfectly described the dichotomy of Beatrice Kiddo's character - an assassin with no more skin in the game after learning she was pregnant. It also revealed how coldly brutal Bill could be, unwilling to let go of the past to seek a personal revenge on a former lover. There's never a question over who's the more sympathetic character, even after the introduction of four year old B.B. Speaking of which, it became a nagging question to me how Bill would have been able to raise her after the Twin Pines Massacre. There might be the germ of a good sequel in there somewhere.The picture has more than it's share of surprises. Recalling that The Bride spent four years in a coma, it was shocking to imagine that she would also be buried alive, initially outsmarted by Bill's brother Budd (Michael Madsen). Her return trip to Budd's trailer home gave us that well choreographed, splendidly awesome fight scene against Elle, the California Mountain Snake (Darryl Hannah). It's one of the action highlights of the picture, and you'll definitely want to keep an eye out for it. Of course, the entire Pai Mei training sequence was a trip, with Gordon Liu paying homage to all the Grand Masters of every martial arts film ever made, punctuated by a symbolic 'whoosh' every time he stroked his snow white beard.In summary, if you like Tarantino's straight come at you style, there's a lot to enjoy with the Kill Bill films. They're stylish, colorful, action packed and violent, and if the characters are more caricature than real, that's OK too, because they were meant to be. Recommended for a unique viewing experience.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
5,gavin6942,The Second Half of a Controversial Film...,7,19 February 2007,"After killing her way through the first movie, The Bride now faces her final three foes: Elle Driver, Budd and Bill. The body count drops dramatically and the plot is stepped up, making this the meat if the first film was the dessert.When I saw this film the first time, I was really put off by it. With so much action in the first movie, I figured the same would happen in the second. But instead I was given a slow, steady series of conversations. And this just made me upset. Films don't work this way! You lay down the plot and then build up to a bloody climax -- you don't massacre people and then nap for two hours.But upon my second viewing, I felt more okay with this when I realized that the idea was to give these final characters more depth and that in some ways made it a stronger film. While some conversations go on for too long (Bill's Superman analogy was interesting, but didn't need another fifteen minutes afterward), some are also very nice.Also, I originally was opposed to Michael Madsen's character (Budd) because to me Madsen is best when he plays ruthless killing machines (""Reservoir Dogs"", for example). But on the second viewing, I saw the beauty of his character. He is actually more complex, wrestling with sibling issues and at the same time being the only one who seems to have a sense of honor: he knows The Bride deserves revenge while everyone else denies her this. And while he is now a slobbish drunk, at the same time he has turned away from a life of violence. His story would be fascinating.""Kill Bill"" as a whole seems like a divider for Tarantino fans. Some people like or hate him altogether (I generally like him). But you will also find those who love ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" (and maybe ""Jackie Brown"" to some degree) but will detest ""Kill Bill"" for whatever reason. Is it the kung fu versus crime themes? I don't know. But that makes these two films Tarantino's most disliked movies, despite also being critically probably some of his best.Obviously, David Carradine is a great actor for this role, and Uma Thurman (although I am not a fan) works well with Tarantino's style. Daryl Hannah does well, and I am especially pleased with the portrayal of Pai Mei. You're probably not watching part two unless you saw part one (but who knows?) and if you like part one, why wouldn't you watch part two? So a recommendation one way or the other is really not important. But I say go for it, even if you doubted the first part. I think the second takes more patience, but maybe you're the type who appreciates substance over action.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
6,lee_eisenberg,where it all leads up to,10,26 June 2006,"I guess that I can't write a spoiler, as the title does that. But I can say that Quentin Tarantino created something beyond what you can imagine. An homage to every martial arts flick, with Uma Thurman kicking ass as much as possible. The whole sequence with Pai Mei looks like it would be real torture.Look, I can't do ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" by describing it. The first part was really something, but this one blows everything out of the water. Thurman, David Carradine, Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah all make the most of their roles. Perfect.So do listen hard, because this does concern you.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
7,jboothmillard,Kill Bill: Vol 2,6,23 June 2005,"This doesn't have as much violence or thrills as the first film, but Quetin Tarantino's directed and written (with the female star's help) part two is still essential for the reason why The Bride (Golden Globe nominated Uma Thurman) kills people from the death list. She was basically (nearly) killed at her wedding practise by Bill (Golden Globe nominated David Carradine) because she never told him she was getting married, or was pregnant, weird. This film tackles the practise day, her training with the mean Pai Mei (Chia Hui Liu/Gordon Liu), and facing the last of her enemies, Buck (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and obviously Bill. The first film had the twist with finding out The Bride/Beatrix Kiddo had a kid, but the bigger twist this time is that she is alive, and has been living with father Bill for the four years she was in a coma! Also starring Michael Parks as Esteban Vihaio and Tarantino regular, Samuel L. Jackson as Rufus, a guest at the wedding. The first film is much more essential viewing, this second part is only good for the chat, and only one or two fights. Bill's death I have to say is rather silly, after the hype to see him die, and he was only given a pound to the chest, not slaughtered like everyone else. Uma Thurman was number 95 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 15 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols. Good!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
8,ccthemovieman-1,Unique Film Surprising For Its Amount Of Dialog,9,15 March 2006,"This is unique, a film unlike any I've seen before. It features either calm discussions (most of the film) or intense, insane action. Most of the film, surprisingly, is talk...and I found the conversations fascinating.After the ultra-violent Kill Bill Vol. 1, this movie was shock. There is no shouting in here, no yelling, just a few very sick killers with good vocabularies talking to one another. It sounds boring, but it wasn't to me. Even the trailer-trash lowlife played by Michael Madsen, had a good way with the words. The violence in here is not that prevalent, and it's not the mindless, brain- numbing kind that made up most of the Vol. 1 in this two-part story. As I said, it was a shock...and yes, I liked this. It's good storytelling.This film is stylish with a capital ""T"" and tells a lot of background of the characters featured in Vol. 1. Among the more memorable scenes, in addition to the great dialog, are Thurman being buried alive; the Chinese teacher; a snake attack and two women duking it out. I liked the ending to this film, too. Nicely done.The cinematography also was good and I appreciated the black-and-white long opening scene....but I still go back to fascinating conversations in this film. I think my favorite is near the end with David Carradine talking about Superman and Clark Kent, and the analogy of them to Thurman's character. Carradine's speeches were consistently interesting.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
9,rmax304823,A Long Trail That Has No Turning.,6,26 April 2012,"""Pulp Fiction"" struck me as a haphazard masterpiece of originality. The incongruity was startling -- Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames tied up in a basement, their mouth stuffed with Japanese S/M balls, and an old Turkish pop song clanging away loudly in the background. And, wow, did ""Pulp Fiction"" have style of a particularly visual sort. It was hard to care who lived or died except that it's usually better when characters survive.""Kill Bill, Vol. 2,"" is an extended revenge story full of twists, pain, and blood. In this one, I cared chiefly that the heroine, Uma Thurman, would survive. Who could not? The gangly all-encompassing limbs. The long monkey feet. The bent nose. The plumbless blue depths of those irises as they peer at us out of a face spattered with gore.But this is a triumph of visuals in which the characters and actions are stylized almost out of existence. People strike odd poses and speak deliberately, relishing each syllable. The amazing thing is that despite the abstraction of style and its fragile roots in reality Tarantino manages to get moments of genuine excitement and terror out of the story. It makes you not want to be buried alive.The highlight comes when two blond babes -- Thurman and Darryl Hannah -- face one another with and without expensive Japanese Hondo swords. The camera zooms in and out in a frenzy, sometimes with only a single eyeball as its focus, while the air inside a shack is filled with flying kicks and flashing steel, of a like never before seen by any human being except those who have known my ex wife. I'll tell you, this scene alone left me panting and exhausted.But for all the flash, it's more a fantasy than anything else, only one or two steps away from a kid's cartoon or a computer war game. I got some of the in jokes and allusions, I think, but the imagery becomes tiresome after a while. It all prompted me to with that everyone had sat down for an hour or two with a couple of bottles of Dos Equis and simply, I don't know, taken a breather.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
10,Tweekums,The blood-spattered bride finally meets Bill,8,16 January 2012,"After the almost non-stop action of volume one some people may be disappointed at the much slower pace of this film. The story opens with The Bride driving to her final Rendezvous with Bill and she announces that he is the last one left on her list. We then return to see what happened to Budd and Elle. Surprisingly this doesn't stop these confrontations from being intense... particularly the former where she finds herself facing almost certain death in a scene which is likely to disturb anybody who suffers from claustrophobia! At this point the story jumps back even further in time to the point where The Bride is in training with Pai Mei, an elderly kung-fu master; this explains how she can escape and ultimately what she will do when she meets Bill. While she was trapped Elle has killed Budd who had informed her that The Bride was dead; she learns that he was mistaken very shortly afterwards they clash Hattori Hanzo swords. Once Elle is out of the way it is time for The Bride to visit Bill and when she does she has a surprise; her daughter is still alive! Will this affect her plans or will she spare her daughter's father? I preferred Volume One but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy this too; it was good to learn a bit more about The Bride's past and find out just what she had done to make Bill angry enough to shoot her in the head. The scenes between David Carradine and Uma Thurman were brilliant; this was largely down to Carradine's voice, some how he managed to sound totally calm yet still be menacing. After the spectacular conclusion to volume one the final confrontation here seemed less than spectacular although this did make sense; Bill wasn't going to hide behind henchmen and his words were more important than his actions. As one would expect from a Tarantino film the music, much of it inspired by spaghetti westerns, went well with the action and as with volume one the style of the filming changed to suit the scene. For the most part I found the story exciting but I could have done without the scene where The Bride meets Bill's father figure; it slowed the story down at precisely the moment it needed to speed up and get her together with Bill. Over all though I recommend this film to anybody who liked the first part; although I'm sure there aren't many people left who liked the first and still haven't got around to watching this!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
11,ma-cortes,Stimulating and thrilling second part that closes the splendid volume,7,15 June 2005,"In this incredible 2ª part by the great screenwriter and director Quentin Tarantino finishes the revenge executed by ¨the bride¨(Uma Thurman) started in Kill Bill vol. 1. After having deleted two names of her black list , the ¨Black Mamba¨(Uma) returns for the vengeance on Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle Driver (Daryl Hanna) , the sole survivors of the murderer commando that betrayed her four years ago . Black Mamba attempts to annihilate her enemies , and at the end she'll try to obtain her main objective : Kill Bill, the prior chief and lover and the man who ordered her execution .If you have seen the Volume 1, you know about unstopped action and black humor but without the Volume 2, you'll only know the halve history . Tarantino said that in Vol.1 tried the making a Kung-Fu film developed in Japan , while in the Vol.2 to make a Spaghetti Western . There are various homages to several movies , thus : Hong Kong films of the Shaw Brothers , Kung-Fu television series when David Carradine himself appears playing the flute , musical score and sets of the Italian Western or Spaghetti .
In the picture there are murders , frenetic action , chop-socky , tension , shootouts and a little bit of gore when the violent struggles happen . Uma Thurman is magnificent , her fights against the enemies are breathtaking , the hard training with the Kung-Fu master Yuen Woo Ping have created a exciting and very well choreography struggle scenes . David Carradine who in the first part makes an invisible intervention here is the starring and he's top-notch. And a moving musical score composed by director Robert Rodriguez who remades Spaghetti classy music and at the end there's a gorgeous song . Robert Richardson cinematography is colorful and glimmering . Rating : Awesome. Above average .",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
12,dbdumonteil,"the adventures of the Bride, round 2",9,12 August 2006,"Here comes the Bride again in what was one of the most-anticipated films of 2004 which like its elder brother ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" (2003) generated much hype. So far, she killed two important enemies (and many more into the bargain) and so erased two names on her list. There are still three left including Bill who will come last.Through its title, ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" is both a sequel and a non-sequel. The Bride perseveres in her vengeful adventure still related in a chronological disorder but in some chapters or telling flashbacks, Quentin Tarantino reveals us some facts of her past life, notably how she became an expert at martial arts and so how she acquired her knowledge in this domain. Otherwise, this second installment is here to illustrate the famous sentence: ""revenge is a dish best served cold"". And like its elder brother ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" (2003), it's still painstakingly shot. The composition of every sequence, the way they interlock even the position of the characters. Everything is precise, set in a pedantic manner and filled with neat visual or scenarist ideas. About this, I would like to mention the first sequence, the key one which is the origin of the Bride's bloody, vengeful adventure. It's of course, the famous massacre scene in the church isolated in the desert. Tarantino favored off-camera so we will see almost nothing of it but the sounds of the massacre. Another scene is the fight between Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah. Tarantino pulls it off with gusto to insert a violent fight in a cramped place which is a trailer. Then like in the great tradition of the film in which two antagonist protagonists confront each other, the filmmaker delays the final, decisive meeting between them until the end and when this moment will arrive, it won't be what the audience will expect in its construction and its evolution.Like in its elder companion, the Bride perseveres in her desire of revenge and its fulfillment and as for Tarantino, he continues in his quest to pay homage to essentially the samurai film and the spaghetti western. Thus, ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" is filled with cinema-going details, borrowings or influences, here mainly linked to the second cinematographic genre. John Ford and Sergio Leone's worlds are quoted and in another extent, I wonder whether the scene when Budd buries alive the Bride in the ground wasn't influenced by George Sluizier's chilling ""Spoorloos"" (1988).But ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" differs from its elder brother on numerous points. About the influences, if the samurai film was essentially to the fore in the first installment, the second one favors the spaghetti western, would it be only by the scenery and the barren landscapes. And as many users pointed out before, violent fights were the most momentous scenes in ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"", at least the scenes which were the most vivid to the audience. These scenes take a back seat in ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" in spite of the admirable fight sequence I mentioned above. An increasing psychological tension in the confrontations between the characters reigns during a good part of the movie. Besides, the first sequence which partly showcases a long conversation between the Bride and her worst enemy Bill sets the scene for this chosen perspective. So, action and stunts are relegated to a position of secondary importance to leave the place to long, chatty sequences but Tarantino could have deleted Bill's superfluous words about Superman. Be that as it may, it was maybe the best choice from Tarantino because these long conversations have several functions: to act as a counterbalance to the choreographed action scenes, to unveil the characters' motivations and for the Bride, eloquent bribes of her past.This assumed side from Tarantino to put the accent on the dialogs (very good in most of them) enables to appreciate the performances of the whole cast and this, perhaps more than in the debut opus. Minor characters aren't forgotten and I would grant a distinction to Michael Madsen as Budd, perhaps the best of the batch. The pinnacle of his acting has to be found in the scene when he's about to bury alive the Bride, he just has to say simple but formidable words to tame her.I repeat it: I'm not really a Tarantino devotee but I have a warm spot on these two ""Kill Bill"" movies and I would trade ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994) for this duo of films. Various influences from diverse horizons were melded to give two well-rounded flicks which in spite of their different contents complete themselves. Was it wise from Tarantino to release it on two volumes? I think so because if the two films had been bridged end to end, it would have given a spotty, irregular film. So, it was perhaps necessary to divide two distinct parts.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
13,Quinoa1984,"On the whole, so to speak, or by itself, the second part of Kill Bill fits the Tarantinian psychology",10,22 August 2004,"Although, as a film buff myself, having a whole Kill Bill epic in one sitting would've been satisfying, like the first part that was split Vol. 2 works extraordinarily well. In terms of storytelling it's direct and (of course) unconventional, in style Tarantino pays homage/borrows (or depending on your point of view steals) from most of the films that stew around in his arsenal. And with dialog, in maybe a couple of moments it doesn't seem up to par, but it's not often. And the acting is in the greatest tradition of B-movie, spaghetti western, shaw-brothers, kung-fu et. all. If you look at both Kill Bills it's fascinating as a movie buff to discover things you haven't seen before (i.e. the whole blood-coated style of the climax in vol. 1) and things you recognize right away (i.e. the unmistakable songs of Ennio Morricone, who is just as creditable as Leone for Tarantino's style).What's there to say about the story, except that it picks up where it left off? Sort of- as usual, the non-linear story aspect kicks in, and two sections of the film derail from the continuing story of revenge on the DIVAs and Bill (the squad members this time being the perfectly paced in tone and presence Michael Madsen as Budd, and Daryl Hannah's most vindictive role as Elle Driver). At first, we get a stark, black and white view of what the ""Massacre at Two Pines"" was like, and right away we're introduced (finally) to Bill, played by David Carradine, one of the most calm, affecting film villain performances in recent memory. The other derailment is to tell the immensely entertaining story of The Bride's training by the heavy-duty Pai Mei (Gordon Liu, in one of his performances in the whole KB saga). This could be counted as the funnest part of the film, aside from a few key moments, as the camera sweeps from medium to close up happen every thirty seconds or so. In the acting department, as I've said, Tarantino gets a big boost- this could be counted as being one of the key performances of not only Carradine's career, but Thruman's as well. They elevate the mood of Tarantino's (sometimes) tongue-in-cheek dialog, but they're also pro's that do their best when it comes time to the showdown, with monologues that come close to being QT's most memorable (although not his best- as cool as it all sounds, it doesn't hit the Pulp Fiction marker). When it does end, the whole operatic sense of the film seems to work, and to the audience it will either be a fitting end or a disappointment. It is, at least, the most ambitious action/comedy/drama/kung-fu/western/romance film (this is referring to Vol. and both volumes together) in many a moon; it's a lot like opening up the filmmaker's skull, and getting a scrambled up dosage of his memories and references, and it works much more often than not. Oh, and how about a bit of applause to Bob Richardson and Michael Parks! A+",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
14,BandSAboutMovies,The conclusion,10,23 March 2019,"When we last saw the Bride, she'd crossed two names off of her kill list: O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green. And oh yeah - we also learned that her daughter is still alive. Now, she's finally going to do what she's been promising. She's going to kill Bill...right after she gets through Elle, Budd and everyone else.The Bride sets off for the trailer of Sidewinder/Budd, who is also Bill's brother. Speaking of Bill, he's warned him that the Bride is on her way, so as she gets close, Budd blasts her with a shotgun packed with rock salt, then buries her alive. To top it all off, he calls in Elle Driver and offers to sell the Bride's sword for a million dollars.We go back in time to see Bill leaving the Bride behind at the temple of Pai Mei (Gordon Liu!), who in time will teach her his most deadly secret: the Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique. He's never shown it to anyone before because it kills any opponent before they take five steps. The training is beyond horrible - if you've seen any Hong Kong martial arts film, you'll understand - but the Bride emerges with Pai Mei's respect. She uses his lessons to break her way free from the coffin.Elle Drive kills Budd with an actual black mamba, the snake that the Bride took her codename from. She calls Bill to let him know that his brother has been killed by the Bride, but that she's already killed her. As she does so, she reveals her enemy's true name: Beatrix Kiddo. Both of these women were trained by Mei, so the battle is beyond destructive (we have an entire article about the references in this film right here that will explain so much more), ending with Elle revealing that she poisoned and killed Mei after he took her eye. The Bride tears out her other eye and leaves her in the abandoned trailer, along with the deadly snake.The Bride goes to Mexico, where retired pimp Esteban Vihaio (Michael Parks!) helps her find Bill, who is in a hotel with their daughter B.B. After a family-friendly evening, Bill shoots the Bride with a dart filled with truth serum. He learns that she left the Vipers to give her daughter a better life, but Bill only found out that she was missing and assumed that the man she was to marry was B.B.'s father.The Bride then hits the dreaded Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique. Bill makes peace with her, takes five steps and dies. Beatrix Kiddo and B.B. leave to start a new life.There were plans to make numerous sequels to this film, including two anime films that would be the origin of Bill and the Bride. There was also talk of Kill Bill: Volumes 3 and 4, which would have two killers whose arms and eye were taken by the Bride and then a cycle of stories about daughters who avenge the death of their mothers. But these days, everyone is non-committal about a sequel.I love the dichotomy between these two films. The first is pure spectacle and brawls with hundreds of people. Just like the tagline to Jaws: The Revenge, this time it's personal.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
15,Coventry,Tarantino's Triumph: Volume Two,9,22 April 2004,"Rarely 	known a movie I've been looking forward to so much than Q.T's resumption of the Kill Bill saga. I, as well as millions of others film-freaks, awaited Uma Thurman's further adventures with wicked anticipation. And of courseTarantino didn't disappoint. Volume two is a completely different movie than volume one, but it's equally brilliant and the director's trademarks are shown more than obviously. Volume one merely was homage to the Eastern Martial Arts movies, with delightfully over-the-top splatter and gore while Vol. 2 fully focuses on ancient westerns and rural horror. There's more dialogue, more twists n turns and the anti-chronological structure results in more depth and involvement. Some unexplained elements from Vol.1 become clear now and even the entire background of Thurman's character gets unveiled. For the very first time, (as far as I can remember) Tarantino really knows how to create an unbearable tension! There's a sequence in which Uma is buried alive and trapped under the groundThrough simple methods, like a completely black screen, Tarantino arises claustrophobia among the audience! Truly terrific filmmaking. The actors in Kill Bill aren't Hollywood's best, but they each have their charisma and their typical Tarantino characters do the rest. The camera viewpoints are brilliant at times and  as usual  the tiny absurd elements are a joy to discover. Tarantino's entire Kill Bill achievement may easily be considered as one of the most creative and dared film-projects ever! Do yourself a favor and watch them! Over and over again.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
16,michaelRokeefe,Raging rampage of revenge.,6,27 November 2005,"Sequel to KILL BILL Vol 1: directed and written by Quentin Tarantino with input from Uma Thurman. Compared to its predecessor, this movie is more wordy and the action seems less urgent...but still violent. The explosive atmosphere is just not here this time. The Bride(Thurman)continues the dispensing of her former colleagues and her quest for justice is just a few swings of the Samari sword away. Bloodshed and maiming continues. Two remaining foes--Budd(Michael Madsen) and Elle Driver(Daryl Hannah)are on her 'to do'list; before reaching her goal...kill Bill(David Carradine).The cast also features: Samuel L. Jackson, Chia Hui Liu and Perla Haney-Jardine. The action is glued together with another eclectic soundtrack featuring: Ennio Morricone, Charlie Feathers, Shivaree, Johnny Cash and Meiko Kaji. One thing for sure: watching both KILL BILL flicks back to back will leave your ass worn out. Beware of Uma Thurman taking over your dreams.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
17,sunwarrior13,Kill Bill Vol. 2 Is Wildly Entertaining And Smart,10,10 November 2011,"Kill Bill Volume 2 is the second of two volumes that were theatrically released several months apart. Kill Bill was originally scheduled for a single theatrical release, but with a running time of over four hours, it was separated into two volumes. Kill Bill Volume 1 was released in late 2003, and Kill Bill: Volume 2 was released in early 2004.It was an action thriller that stars that stars Uma Thurman as The Bride together with David Carradine as Bill,Lucy Liu,Vivica A. Fox,Michael Madsen,Daryl Hannah and Gordon Liu. The story continues to follow a character known as ""The Bride"", a former assassin who seeks revenge on still-active colleagues who massacre members of her wedding party and try to kill her.It was written and directed by Quentin Tarantino.Kill Bill Volume 2 continues the saga of The Bride in her revenge after having dispatched several of her arch-enemies in the first film,Kill Bill Volume 1.In a flashback, the Bride and her groom rehearse their wedding. Bill arrives, and it is revealed that The Bride has retired from assassination and left her former lover Bill in order to settle down with her unborn daughter. Moments later, the Deadly Vipers attack on Bill's orders.In the present, Bill warns his brother Budd, a bouncer and former Deadly Viper, that he will be targeted next. The Bride arrives at his trailer, but Budd shoots her full of rock salt with his double-barreled shotgun and then sedates her. Budd calls Elle, offering to sell her The Bride's Hanzō sword, before sealing The Bride inside a coffin and burying her alive.In a flashback, Bill takes The Bride to the temple of Pai Mei,a legendary martial arts master. Pai Mei has mastered a technique wherein pressure points on the victim's chest are struck, leaving them with only a few footsteps before their death. Bill informs The Bride that Pai Mei teaches no one the technique. After she trains under Pai Mei, who initially dislikes her, she eventually wins his respect.The Bride recalls her training with Pai Mei to break out of the coffin to the surface. The next morning, Elle arrives at Budd's trailer for their transaction. Budd is betrayed by Elle, who uses a black mamba and its venomous bite to poison him. Elle expresses regret that a loser like Budd was the one to kill The Bride, whose name is revealed to be Beatrix Kiddo. As Elle leaves the trailer, she is attacked by The Bride. Elle reveals that her missing eye was plucked out by Pai Mei after she insulted him during her training, and in retribution, she poisoned him. Angered, The Bride plucks out Elle's remaining eye, and leaves Elle writhing and screaming hysterically in the trailer with the black mamba. After finding Bill's location, deep in the Mexican countryside, The Bride infiltrates his home. She is shocked to find B.B., her four-year old daughter, alive and well. The family spend the evening together peacefully, with Bill making sandwiches and Beatrix watching Shogun Assassin in bed with her daughter. Later on, after B.B. has gone to bed, Bill shoots Beatrix with a dart containing a truth serum and questions her. A flashback recalls the moment Beatrix found out she was pregnant. She was on an assignment, and her target had sent an assassin of her own to kill Beatrix. Beatrix managed to convince the assassin not to kill her due to her pregnancy, and they agreed to part ways. Beatrix explains that she ran away without telling Bill in order to protect their unborn daughter from him and his life. Though Bill understands, he remains unapologetic for what he did, explaining that he's a killer and nobody should ever cross him, even her. Bill then attacks Beatrix, but she disables him with Pai Mei's fatal technique, which he secretly taught her. Bill, aware of the technique, gives his final speech, takes five steps, and dies. Beatrix departs with B.B. in her arms, and later they watch cartoons in a hotel together.Kill Bill Volume 2 has more dialogue and less action-packed than the fist film but nevertheless, delivers the goods for those expecting a satisfying conclusion.But still,the film is the epitome of the glamorization of brutality and violence and the same time tries to condemn it as well.Also,deeper themes are explored such as pregnancy and motherhood.Overall,Kill Bill Volume 2 is wildly entertaining and smart that are full of genre-loving savvy, grind-house vigor and liberating energies.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

19,jotix100,Don't mess around with The Bride,10,18 April 2004,"Quentin Tarantino's conclusion of the ""Kill Bill"" films is nothing short of brilliant. He makes it clear he is a master of this genre. In fact, this new film can stand on its own, as far as the story goes. It makes perfect sense in more ways than the first installment where there was more action, but perhaps the narrative is not as clear as in this one.Mr. Tarantino is greatly helped by his choice of Uma Thurman to play his heroine. As with the other film, Ms Thurman demonstrates she is up to the task of battling whatever enemies who dare come her way.The casting is excellent. David Carradine, Michael Parks, Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah, Bo Svenson, Gordon Liu, and the rest of the crew play well under the guidance of Quentin Tarantino. A satisfying time at the movies.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
20,LeonLouisRicci,Calming Calamity,8,23 April 2013,"This is not a sequel. It is the second half of the the first installment. This may have been why so many who loved Vol 1 are disappointed in Vol 2. The whole thing is better viewed as a whole rather than 2 parts. It is not 2 separate Movies it is 1 and really can only be analyzed, appreciated, or enjoyed as such. This doesn't even try to capture, revisit or even indulge the beginning for it is the conclusion. The Bride is not running out of breath, she is running out of antagonists. Like an advancing Army after breaking through the front lines and moving toward the Leaders safely tucked away and removed from the carnage.The extended Tarantino dialog is back and we have more Story here from Movie Modernity's gifted Story teller and the action is more up close and personal as is the emotion. It is more tender and internal. Quite the opposite of the external extremes of Vol 1. It is a satisfying wrap to the Director/Writer's Rap and should not be seen or examined apart from or out of sequence from the first half.In the end it has a calming calamity and has a Personality of its own as there is a portrayal here of the other side, the Feminine side, if you will, as the Assassin/Lover/Bride/Mother comes full circle and returns to the Human Race. It is where the Grind House seques into a Home.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
21,poolandrews,Not as good as Vol. 1...,6,2 July 2007,"Kill Bill: Vol. 2 starts as vengeful assassin Beatrix Kiddo (Uma Thurman) head towards El Passo & Bill's brother Budd (Michael Madsen) to continue her roaring rampage of revenge. Things don't go her way though & she ends up buried alive, can she escape & finally get her long awaited revenge on her ex-boss Bill (David Carradine) who left her & her baby for dead?Written & directed by Quentin Tarantino I'll say it straight away, Kill Bill: Vol. 2 is nowhere near as good as Kill Bill: Vol. 1 (2003) in my opinion. There, I said it & I firmly believe it to be the truth. In Kill Bill: Vol. 1 there was a definite energy, a zip, a breakneck pace that lead from one over-the-top set-piece to another. It had buckets of violence & blood while still maintaining that cool Tarantino vibe that was present in both Reservoir Dogs (1992) & Pulp Fiction (1994) which made them both iconic hits of the 90's. Here in Kill Bill: Vol. 2 the pace is sedate, the self consciously cool small talk dialogue just isn't as effective here with noting particularly exciting happening around it. Kill Bill: Vol. 2 just ends up feeling like a hollow mess with lots of irreverent dialogue which tries to be cool, I'm sorry but for me it didn't work & I frankly missed the violence, the gore & the character's of Kill Bill: Vol. 1 which I think I'm going to watch again to get the memory of Kill Bill: Vol. 2 out of my mind. There are still some nice scenes here & some mildly amusing dialogue along the way but as a whole I don't think it has what made Kill Bill: Vol. 1 so special, above average but below the standard I expected & hoped for.Director Tarantino knows how to turn in a stylish action flick, it's just a shame the action doesn't really start until an hour in. Since Tarantino is a bit of a fan-boy when it comes to martial arts & cult flicks in general there are loads of references to other films which you may or may no notice although I thought it was nice that the film mentions Shogun Assassin (1980) by name as the similarities are obvious & for those of you who don't know Shogun Assassin is a real film & it's an absolutely terrific film at that. Rumour has it Tarantino has a thing for feet & you can tell here because there are a lot of scenes involving people's feet including another scene of Thurman stepping on & crushing someones plucked out eyeball, foot fetishists will enjoy this. I didn't think all of the visual tricks worked in this & preferred the comic book feel of the original. The violence here is much tamer than Kill Bill: Vol. 1, Vol 1 had over forty on screen death's while Vol. 2 has a paltry three of which Thurman only kills one, Elle (Daryl Hannah) kills Budd & Pai Mei (Chia Hui Liu) with Thurman killing Bill at the end. I know violence & action don't necessarily make a great film they sure as hell help!With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 Kill Bill: Vol. 2 is very well made with top notch production values, it definitely has that expensive Hollywood look to it, excellent cinematography & choreography. The acting is pretty good, Thurman makes for a sexy anti-hero & Carradine is a cool bad guy. Samuel L. Jackson gets about 30 seconds of screen time.Kill Bill: Vol. 2 is a definite disappointment after the excellent violent & bloody excess of Kill Bill: Vol. 1, at over two hours it's too long & is a drawn out way to round the story off. Did this really get a 5 minute standing ovation from the audience it was premiered too? If it did why? If you have seen both Kill Bill films & want to watch one again watch the original.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
22,dbborroughs,Dull,4,12 August 2004,"After the explosive ending of Kill Bill: Volume 1 this movie is a major let down. Granted Volume 1 took a while to get going, but once it got firing there was no stopping it. Or so I thought.I don't care what anyone says this film is a series of sequences that are in desperate need of editing. This movie just goes on and on and on. Its a mess.Actually this film has only one problem and that it insists on filling fill in the blanks concerning every single character, whether it  moves the plot or not. Several of these sequences could be so much shorter, but Quentin instead insists on letting them play out until you want to snooze.
Worse this film insists on copying god knows how many film styles, a flaw the first film over came. Most of the styles didn't need to have them paid homage.I will not discuss the ending which goes on to the point of boredom, I dislike it and I'll leave it at that.Perhaps this will play better as seen as one long 5 hour film, but I doubt it.4 out of 10.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
23,zardoz-13,Not As Much Fun as the First One,7,7 June 2012,"Quentin Tarantino has got talent, but he whipped up so much frenzy with ""Kill Bill, Volume 1"" that there was no way that he live up to what he had started in ""Kill Bill, Volume 2."" ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1"" has more artistic merit that the second half. For instance, Tarantino never showed Bill in a full shot in the first half. Obviously, the ""Pulp Fiction"" director was treating his chief villain like the early Blofeld in the James Bond thrillers that didn't show the villain until ""You Only Live Twice."" In the first half of ""Kill Bill,"" our heroine--Beatrix Kiddo (Uma Thurman)survives an attempt on her life. We know that the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad turns out for her wedding rehearsal and mowed down everybody in a barrage of gunfire. However, this singular event was never shown. The discretion that Tarantino exercised in ""Bill 1"" distinguishes it from the lack of discretion that he depicted in the follow-up. Indeed, he doesn't show this homicidal quartet actually perforating everybody in the chapel. Nevertheless, aside from showing the scene as a necessity, this is basically the only thing that he does that doesn't follow the chronology.""Kill Bill, Volume 1"" surpasses ""Kill Bill, Volume 2"" because the demise of O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green are more interesting than the deaths of Budd, Elle Driver, and Bill. Nothing in this half compares with the outrageous swordplay at the House of Blue Leaves. Furthermore, none of the villains in the second half are as memorable as O-Ren. You can almost share of sympathetic tear for O-Ren because she worked up way up to a position of prominence in the Tokyo underworld. Budd and Elle Driver qualify as sadistic louts. The Bride (Uma Thurman) doesn't even kill Budd. Indeed, Elle Driver kills him when she stashes a venomous black mamba in a red piece of luggage that contains a million dollars in $100 dollar bills. The fight scene in ""Kill Bill 2"" is a reversal of the fight scene in ""Kill Bill 1."" Instead of staging an over-the-top combat sequence in a spacious restaurant, Tarantino choreographs a demolition scene fracas in a trailer. While it is imaginative, it seems more claustrophobic and exciting. Unlike O-Ren, neither Budd nor Elle Driver have anything approaching a back-story. He is a drunk and she is a sadistic bitch. The rewards of ""Kill Bill 2"" are the scenes at Pei Mei's place where The Bride learns how to punch her way through wood as well as a special punch that later enables her to kill Bill. Compared with its predecessor, ""Kill Bill 2"" looks and sounds more like a Tarantino film because the dialogue sounds more like ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction."" Unfortunately, again, the characters are not as interesting. You never really hate Bill who comes off as more charismatic. Nevertheless, ""Kill Bill 2"" is worth watching and studying for its narrative structure of setting up things and paying them off. The homages abound and Tarantino indulges more in his penchant for making references to other movies.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Her entire wedding party is massacred in cold blood. After four years in a coma she awakes and systematically sets out to wreak revenge on the people responsible, especially their leader, Bill...Fantastic movie in two parts, written and directed by Quentin Tarantino. Solid, original plot, good character depth, cool dialogue (as you would expect from Tarantino), good action scenes. Good use too of time-jumps, a Tarantino trademark.Good performances too.Of the two movies, I preferred Vol 2 to Vol 1 (though there is not much in it - Vol 2 is a 10, Vol 1 a 9). Vol 1 was more about action, with a massive fight scene towards the end. It had plot, but was more the start of a plot, with many loose threads.Vol 2 had plot development and character development and was less about action (though there was still enough of it). Thus more substance in Vol 2, more style in Vol 1, and substance beats style.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
25,Boba_Fett1138,"Well made but I wish it was more like ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"".",8,23 January 2007,"It's a well made and constructed movie that entertains and again perfectly blends several styles into one unique movieUnfortunately the movie is not as good as ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"". ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" was a way more entertaining because it was way more crazy mixture of style and because of that also very unpredictable and overwhelming. ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" spends more time on the story development and the emotional aspects of it. It perhaps makes ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" a better constructed and build up movie but I still prefer the more entertaining approach of ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"". In that regard ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" perhaps was a bit disappointing to watch but in this particular case that doesn't mean it was a bad movie.""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" mostly mixed Asian cinema styles, ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" mostly uses a Western style. Of course the story alone of taking revenge always has been a popular generic concept for Westerns. The movie also uses some of the genre camera techniques and editing tricks and even adds in some cheesy dialog when two characters are standing across each other, ready to kill. Quentin Tarantino obviously did his homework again but what can I say, Western just isn't my favorite genre. Its style also makes the movie slow at times, so please don't expect another over-the-top going, non-stop spectacular, visual, gory, action spectacle that ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" was. Of course ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" also still features lots- and over-the-top action but it just didn't impressed as much, due to the different style and approach.The movie features some great acting and dialog. Yes, this movie does feature some great typical Tarantino's dialog at times. Something I really missed in ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"". Also the movie as whole, in terms of its style and build up, is perhaps more 'Tarantino-like' than ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" was. The story, again, is for part told non-linear and this time that style works out fully, unlike in ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" sometimes wasn't the case.David Carradine is really superb as Bill! What a comeback for an actor! The same goes for Daryl Hannah by the way, lets please not forget her. David Carradine really steals the show in the movie and at times he even puts the main character, played by Uma Thurman, in the shadow. Also Michael Madsen was great and so was Sid Haig in a small but amusing role. The Samuel L. Jackson was also one of the highlights of the movie.The movie is amazingly good looking and has a good visual style, also with the help of Robert Richardson's cinematography, obviously. Tarantino again successfully succeeds at mixing several styles of film-making into one unique great movie, with an own great one of a kind identity. Mission accomplished Mr. Tarantino!There isn't as much blood spilled in this movie but yet the action does not disappoint. Like I said before, the emphasis of this movie is more put on its story and characters, rather than its action but still the action works out greatly in the movie. The movie features some highly memorable action sequences and also the ending does not disappoint.A really great and unique movie, that could had been more entertaining and perhaps also better, had it been made more in the style of ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"". 8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
26,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Exactly as it should be,10,23 June 2009,"After the first showed us what an efficient killer The Bride was, this provides the background that makes it all matter, and gives her a human face. If you only watch the former, you may walk away thinking that it was nothing more than a revenge flick, if an excellent one at that. You may believe that the characters were thought up for the sake of the retribution. It is, in fact, the vengeance that helps complete, and provide satisfaction, for the overall story-line. I can imagine people being disappointed by this... the first had non-stop action, and to the undistinguishing eye may have looked almost ""mainstream"", and perhaps they thought that Tarantino had changed his tune. This is not the same as Vol. 1, and it shouldn't be. There were incredible martial arts in that, and while what there is of that is, again, amazing, there is considerably less of it. The style of wuxia with some Western added in is still very much present. This is quite emotionally straining. I can understand if there are those who would go so far as to call it outright abusive to the audience. It definitely is brutal, and unforgettable. The non-linear time-line is impeccably well-used here. I can't compliment the editing and cinematography enough. The writing is beyond reproach. All of the dialog is marvelous. The acting is spot-on, every single person. This is immensely well-scored by Rodriguez. There is no direct sexuality, only references. The violence is bloody and gory. There is plenty of strong language in this. This has disturbing content, and many are not going to be able to stand it. The DVD comes with a making-of featurette upwards of half-hour in length, a trailer for each of the director's movies, including these two, a deleted fight scene of three and a half minutes, and an eleven minute music performance by Robert and his band, Chingon. All of them are worth the time. I recommend this to any fan of Quentin's, Uma's or of film-making. 10/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

I understand his stylistic choice to do so, but had there been the expository character development at the start of the story which appears here, I would have cared more for the character through the events of what became Volume 1.Thurman and Carradine are excellent, and the domestic stand-off at the end, after the almost apocalyptic shenanigans of the first film, is a fine, fine conclusion to The Bride's story.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
28,evanston_dad,Vol. 1 Was Dessert--This Is the Main Course,10,3 February 2006,"""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is the second half of one large story, and it creates a cohesive whole with the first part, but in many ways it's a completely different movie from Vol. 1. The first half was all about movement--it was almost balletic in its merging of images and music. Vol. 2 slows down, WAY down, to create a stoic, mythic conclusion. Where events in Vol. 1 rushed by in a glib montage, with blood spewing and limbs flying around the screen in a parody of film violence, everything about Vol. 2 feels heavy with consequence---there's much less violence, but what there is feels like it matters far more.Uma Thurman gave a nimble, athletic performance in Vol. 1, but really impresses here with her ability to get to the dramatic bottom of her character. Beatrix Kiddo's conflict emerges---she becomes a flesh and blood human character rather than a comic book hero seeking revenge. David Carradine, as Bill, is the second part's most significant addition, and he plays his part perfectly. And I got a kick out of Daryl Hannah's Elle Driver, who turns in a memorable cameo in the first part, but really gets a chance to strut her stuff in the second.I don't think it's a criticism of Tarantino's films to say that the first part is all style while the second part is the substance; it's like eating your dessert before the main meal. I think Tarantino would be the first to agree, and both parts exhibit all the signs of being thoughtfully and carefully assembled. One thing you're never in doubt of when dealing with Tarantino is that you're seeing the exact movie he wants you to see.But why spend time worrying about which one is better or which one succeeds more? They're both part of the same movie---one wouldn't exist without the other. And they're both remarkable.Grade: A+",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
29,ferguson-6,An eye for an eye,9,18 April 2004,"Greetings again from the darkness.  The most descriptive word I can come up with for Vol. 2 is DELICIOUS!  Although I am a big fan of Vol. 1, this one is far superior, stands on its own, and is mad creativity onscreen.  Vol. 2 provides us with much of the background and history of our key players, including their acceptance (or not) of spirituality.  What a pleasure to see David Carradine given such a wonderful role ... an evil role that reminds of his ""kung Fu"" days (with flute) - only this is Caine's gleefully monsterous twin brother!  Michael Madsen and Darryl Hannah offer nice supporting work and some very welcome humor.  The fight scene with Hannah and Uma in the trailer is incredible, given the limited space with which to work.  I would like to say that this scene proved the most claustrophobic for me, but it is not even close!  Despite the wonderful cast of characters, this is Uma's film all the way.  She delivers like no other female action star ever has. Humble, personal, beautiful and vicious.  Her physicality is remarkable and enthralling to watch.  Tarantino delivers again.  His creativity and love of film is beyond question.  I take this as much more of a tribute to the old chop-socky movies than a spoof.  He is the master at interjecting humor just when the audience needs it.  The use of music is pure genius and helps create this terrific masterpiece.  Thanks QT for casting Michael Parks in 2 roles - the sheriff in Vol. 1 and the old man at the whore house in Vol. 2. Nothing to say but tremendous filmmaking and a joy to watch.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

This one is about penetration. As remembered from Volume 1 the Bride's wedding was ambushed by the Deadly Viper Assassins with the massacre concluding when Bill shoots her into a four year coma. Volume 2 opens with her being buried alive, which allows her to reflect upon her strict training. What makes this film work is its exploration of her and Bill's relationship and the concluding revelations. Director Quentin Tarantino details the film with his usual flair of outstanding dialogue. His previous films include the acclaim Pulp Fiction as well as Jackie Brown and Reservoir Dogs. Uma Thurman is excellent as the Bride who faced death and emerged with grim determination to face her past. David Carradine plays Bill as an intelligent and charming assassin with a sense of regret. Daryl Hannah plays the lethal Elle Driver whose fate is even more so. Michael Madsen plays Budd who is surprisingly the most sympathetic character in the film. He works at a strip club and lives in a secluded trailer. Gordon Liu is a strong presence as Pai Mei who puts the Bride under extreme training that ultimately leads to respect. Everything reflects upon why the Bride wanted out and the life she truly pursued when freedom arrived. Score: 10 / 10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

This is more of a western, and spends a lot of time set in a sandy location.Carradine is superb, he is almost the coolest character Taratino has ever invented, and carradines delivery of the lines are like chocolate to the ears.Tarantinos direction keeps the film flowing smoothly, and proves he is still one of the best directors out there.

Plus it afforded me the luxury of seeing both films back to back. Whereas the first half was all glitz and lightning fast action set pieces, which was a fun ride. This half is more typically Tarantino in relation to the dialog that seems to crackle and ooze coolness. Not to say there isn't any action, as there are a few great stand-out set pieces to be had, just not as manic as the first half. This is leisurely and takes it's time and for true fans, it's all the better for it. David Carradine is great as Bill, Uma gets her most-rounded performance in her career, and while the movie, as a whole, isn't as sheerly fun as Pulp Fiction, nor as perfect as the sadly under-rated Jackie Brown, it still makes for a hell of a ride.

33,Wuchakk,Tarantino's amusing super-assassin bizarro world,7,24 November 2016,"RELEASED IN 2004 and written/directed by Quentin Tarantino, ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" completes the story of 2003's ""Vol. 1"" and fills in the holes. Former assassin, The Bride (Uma Thurmon), seeks vengeance after the murder of her fiancé & friends at a wedding rehearsal in El Paso. She takes on formidable thugs Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle (Daryl Hannah) to finally get to ringleader Bill (David Carradine). Gordon Liu plays master martial artist Pai Mei while Michael Parks is on hand as Esteban Vihaio.This part of the duology is more dialogue-driven than ""Vol. 1,"" fleshing-out the characters and answering many questions. Such as: How is The Bride such an unconquerable fighter? How did Elle lose her right eye? Why did Bill conduct the wedding massacre? How does Budd spend his retirement? The problem is that the characters are all cartoony caricatures, and merciless assassins to boot. It's impossible to give criminal scum ""more depth,"" at least as far as caring for them goes. Let 'em all kill each other for all I care. Moreover, the story is too shallow to warrant such epic treatment and would've been more effective if both films were condensed into a 2.5 hour flick, cutting out the fat.Still, the movie's so offbeat that it's entertaining in the manner of 1996's ""Mojave Moon,"" but better. It's an interesting combo of spaghetti Westerns, 70's martial arts flicks, Bond-isms and all-around Tarantino quirkiness. But suggesting that the ""Kill Bill"" flicks are cinematic masterpieces of auteurism is overdoing it. Take, for instance, the ridiculous closing credits, which run well over 12 minutes: The plot and characters are unworthy of such pretentious veneration. If you want masterworks by Tarantino, see ""Django Unchained"" (2012) and ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994); or even ""Inglourious Basterds"" (2009) and ""Jackie Brown"" (1997).Still, the movie's strangely amusing, the cast is good (especially Carradine) and Bill's Superman analysis is insightful. The Bride's training with Pai Mei is arguably the best bit.THE MOVIE RUNS 137 minutes and was shot in Southern California; Beijing, China; and Mexico.GRADE: B/B- (6.5/10)",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
34,safenoe,Kill William: Vol. 2 should have been as good as if not better than the first one,7,18 August 2021,"Kill William: Vol. 2 should have been as good as if not better than Kill William: Vol. 1, considering both were filmed at the same time. I guess it's the immutable law of sequels, which aren't as good as the original (although The Godfather II and Aliens are notable exceptions). Anyway, hopefully there'll be a Kill Bill: Vol. 3.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
35,The_Void,Tarantino enters Spaghetti Western mode,7,12 July 2008,"The first part to Quentin Tarantino's overly violent and exploitative revenge epic was a love letter addressed to Japanese Pink films and Kung Fu flicks. This second part is his homage to Spaghetti Westerns. The main difference between the styles of the two films is the pace - while the original was fast and furious, this one is a much more thoughtful and drawn out affair and while that may intrigue some viewers more; I have to say that Volume 1 did more for me. Still, it's quite clear Tarantino surely knows how to make a bona fide cult film and thoroughly entertain his audience on the way - and this film succeeds in doing that admirably. The plot is very simple and follows on directly from the first film. Having ticked off the first two names from her 'death list', The Bride now closes in on the final three killers that ruined her wedding day - Budd, Ellie Driver and of course, Bill himself. The film follows The Bride as she tracks down the killers, also filling us in further on the story of the revenge and her relationship with Bill.The key to this film's success is really very simple - colourful characters and sharp dialogue. I have to be honest and say that I found the script for Kill Bill Volume 2 to be weaker than some of his previous efforts with much of the dialogue coming off as being extremely forced - but this is a comic book thrill ride at it's best and the characters themselves shine all the way through. As mentioned previously, the film is much slower than the first one, although there's plenty going on and the first hour and twenty minutes is a constant thrill ride complete with menacing characters and grisly situations (though nothing to rival the amazing climax to Volume 1). Of course, the entire two part epic is a build up to the central character carrying out the title's statement and Tarantino really had a lot of promise to deliver on with the ending. Anyone hoping for a spectacular face off (me for example) will be extremely disappointed, however. David Carradine does get lots of opportunities to justify his place in the film - he's by far the most natural actor in terms of how he delivers his dialogue and Tarantino rewards this by giving him plenty of interesting things to say; but the final showdown is over far too quickly. The film has other problems too; the biggest being some very silly and difficult to believe sequences (such as the flashback during The Bride's talk with Bill) that bring it down a little, but in spite of that; this is still a very good cult film that should not disappoint too many people that loved Volume 1.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
36,mm-39,Best to rent Vol 1 and 2 and watch it together!,6,2 May 2004,"Volume 2 like Volume 1 is lacking, and the story misses that special sauce. This movie in reality is 1 cut into 2, thus watching 1 leaves the story lacking, and too silly, and watching 2 the movie is serious, but lacks depth, because the viewer loses continuity and background from the 1.   If I watch the 2 films together, the movie would be a 7 or 8, but separate the viewer loses the film's rhythm, making the film awkward, giving the film a less deserving 6.  Kill Bill is outlandish  and entertaining enough to compare with Dusk til Dawn.  Rent the two films together and watch them one after the other so that the story makes sense.  I would not have minded if the movie was long at the theatre, they could of just had an intermission. For example, Scarface and the Godfather had intermissions.  I hope the studio did not cut this movie in 2 for revenue reasons.  Imagine how awful the Godfather or Scarface movie experience would of been if the audience had to wait 3 months to see what happened after Sonny got killed or Tony got arrested for washing money.  6 out of 10 possible 7 or 8 if the 2 volumes were watched together.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
37,Mr-Fusion,Revenge gets complicated,8,16 February 2017,"""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" has a lot of explaining to do, and it makes sense that it's the Western half of Tarantino's opus. It feels sprawled out, taking its sweet time in getting to The Bride's backstory. Boring? God, no, but the tempo is more leisurely. Less bloody than the first half, this is certainly the more vicious of the two. It's here that we get to see Beatrix's brutal training at the hands of Pai Mei, the love story that develops between herself and Bill, and the even more gruesome hurdles that stand between her and sweet revenge. The big surprise is that it's not all violence; there's a sweetness at the center of all of this.It's not as flashy and exciting as Vol. 1, but it gives substance to her bloodthirst and really does stand as a worthy payoff.8/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
38,christopher-underwood,David Carradine is the one who probably stopped me from going to sleep.,7,2 September 2019,"I haven't seen the first Kill Bill since its theatrical release and this part, never. In the mood to look back at Tarantino's earlier films I came across a piece that suggested part 2 was far superior to part 1. I deduced that the first part would concentrate on the awful treatment metered out and a prolonged training process in readiness for revenge which would be part 2. This, it seems is only partly true with the first actually being much more a traditional QT product full of style and panache with the second much more interested in giving the characters background. Unfortunately, for me, this includes much martial arts mumbo jumbo and a rather drawn out film with little style. Michael Madsen is great, Thurman fine and David Carradine is the one who probably stopped me from going to sleep.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
39,whpratt1,Bill Vol. 2 was Outstanding,10,19 September 2006,"Enjoyed Bill Vol. 1, however, this film went back to the same characters and gave more of a history into the Bride and how she learned all the secret powers of becoming a super killer in order to get revenge from all the people who harmed her. Uma Thurman gave an outstanding performance when she is being taught by a very old wise teacher of defense and some very important deadly parts of the body which can destroy a person even if they are almost sitting on top of you, face to face or nose to nose. Uma Thurman did a great job of sword swinging and got herself out of almost impossible situations, like being buried alive and many other horrible situations. David Carradine,(Bill) had a larger role in this film and showed his great acting abilities, just like his father John Carradine, ""Dracula '40 and ""House of Frankenstein) This is a film you can watch from the beginning to the end and enjoy every minute of great entertainment by all the actors.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
40,namashi_1,Tarantino rocks!,7,27 September 2009,"I loved volume one... it's one of my favorite films. 'Kill Bill: Vol.2' is also great, but lacks compared to it's first, in a way... as this is a continuation. Tarantino's outstanding direction keeps you hooked... he's in form as ever. In my eye, he's the finest filmmaker of this generation. The sequence when Uma escapes from the coffin is the high-light of the enterprise. Amazingly short & written. It's the best movie scene in a long time. Though, I think the way Bill was killed was boring. It just doesn't work, Uma should have given him a tough fight rather than performing a kung-fu stint. Nonetheless, this film's a must see.Uma Thurman is outstanding as the revengeful bride. Late actor David Carradine is flawless. Daryl Hannah & Michael Madsen are superb. on the whole, not as good as it's prequel... but worth a watch. Thumbs Up!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
41,Smells_Like_Cheese,It builds up to nothing,8,18 August 2004,"Finally, after the long wait to rent Kill Bill Vol. 2, I watched it. I was so excited. I thought the first Kill Bill was great. But I was a bit disappointed.First off, a clearence to fans of Q.T. I do think that Quentin is very good at what he does as a director. But he is still like any other director. I tend to notice that every film he made, his fans act like it was the greatest movie in the world. So, to any fan reading this review, it is just my opinion. SPOILER ALERT!!!The beginning is great. Great dialouge, acting, and action. There is more drama and explination than the first Kill Bill. Elle's kill is the best by far with the removale of the other eye. And the black mamba is a great touch. We finally get to Bill. The big and final show down. And we're going with it. This has been the Bride's goal since the first movie. And she just kills him within 5 seconds. It's very lame and pathetic. And her child just accepts her into her life like as if she had always been in her mother's life.Over all, it's a good movie. It just is a little disappointing.8/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
42,MovieAddict2016,One of Tarantino's lesser efforts; a notch down from the first KILL BILL; still very good...,7,25 April 2004,"The opening credits of Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" roar across the screen with a vengeance, indicating a second installment that may very well be superior in many ways to that of its first. For about the first forty minutes or so, this theory seemed to hold steadfast, but as the clock kept ticking and the dialogue kept on rambling I found myself just a bit under whelmed by a film that, although a fine motion picture, is entirely different from its predecessor -- and not necessarily in a very good way.I estimated that about forty rather unnecessary minutes could (and should) have been cut by the editor. There's the totally nonessential twenty minutes spent introducing us to Budd (Michael Madsen), a hit man who works for Bill (David Carradine), who in turn is being targeted by hate-filled Bride (Uma Thurman). The flaw of this setup is that it is superfluous and unneeded -- Budd is presented to the audience as a loser, working at a deserted strip joint in Texas, fired from his job and living the life of a bum.Perhaps Quentin should have saved these scenes for the supposed director's cut of the films being released to DVD some time this year (or next). They don't exactly click with the entirety of his movie -- they simply slow it down. It is as if Quentin is paying his respects to ""The Matrix Reloaded"" with way far too much empty dialogue. It was great in ""Pulp Fiction"" because it *wasn't* empty, but here it is, to be frank, rather meaningless. One of many things I loved about the first film was its supremely fast pace with non-stop action -- but in a good way. It was a no-holds-barred revenge story with references ranging from Hideo Gasha to Sergio Leone to Brian DePalma in many literal ways. The first installment was very campy and just good ol' fun -- Quentin best described it as doing for '70s grind house cinema what ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" did for the serials of the '30s and '40s. The second installment is just plain different -- not much of an homage, all of the gratuitous style is gone. Also gone is much of the enthusiasm -- hard to explain in a review but very apparent to the viewers.I also didn't appreciate the ending very much. Throughout the first installment of the series (now rumored to be a trilogy, completed in fifteen years) the goals of The Bride were most important -- nothing stood in her way. From start to finish it was a brutal, stylish ride designed for the movie buff within us all. We didn't feel the need to sympathize with her because she was not a particularly sympathetic character. Many people complained about this. It seems that Quentin has heard their cries -- the audiences who complained about lack of character progression and Tarantinoesque dialogue need not worry -- ""Volume 2"" has plenty of it. And in my own opinion far too much.""Volume 2"" has too many long gaps that break the non-stop action -- perhaps to compensate for lack of actual storyline. It's a revenge movie. No need for long scenes with metaphorical speeches. When The Bride finally comes face-to-face with her final foe, Quentin puts the story on hold, completely throwing off the audience in a very negative way. Bill's dialogue to The Bride about superhero comic books was embarrassingly Tarantino -- he hinted at his love for comic books in the screenplay for ""True Romance,"" and here it seems oddly out of place.As a whole, ""Kill Bill Volume 2"" is very good. As a sequel to one of the best films of 2003, it is a rather lackluster affair, very different from the original but mostly in rather unfortunate ways. As a whole its predecessor is far superior -- I left ""Volume 2"" feeling a bit under whelmed and disappointed. Had Tarantino chosen to delete forty minutes of unnecessary balderdash and kept up the style and pace and brutality of the first film, I feel as though I might have left feeling very pleased. Instead I left telling myself that it was, at the very least, a good conclusion to the story -- which may still be open for yet another installment in fifteen years, according to Tarantino, who wants to make it his ""Dollars"" trilogy. And so we wait...4/5.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
43,Red-Barracuda,Entertaining conclusion to Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' epic,8,3 August 2017,"With this film Quentin Tarantino concluded his 'Kill Bill' epic. The decision to do this as a two-parter was because the material he amassed for the project soon became so sizeable that it became impractical to release as a single film; both movies combined clocked in at over four hours. At the time, Tarantino was such a powerful director that he could essentially do what he liked and this two volume offering is certainly self-indulgent. I've always wondered if, with some editing, there was maybe one excellent film in here as opposed to two good ones. But that is strictly by-the-by now and what we have is two entertaining, if uneven, films. For my money, part one is the superior entry but I still think vol.2 still offers a lot of enjoyment. Where Tarantino's 90's films integrated their movie references and numerous homages into their overall crime stories quite seamlessly, his post-millennium efforts have tended to include them often just for their own sake. This has tended to make his films from this later period feel like the sum of their parts outweighs the whole and overall I have usually felt that they, while often exhibiting directorial and screen writing excellence, often include frustrating moments of inanity. The 'Kill Bill' films display these faults too I think but also the considerable directorial, and to a lesser extent, screen writing skills of its creator. With this entry the Bride continues on her revenge mission against her former colleagues from the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. We learn more about the infamous incident where they carried out a murderous assault on her and her wedding party. We also finally meet Bill for the first time and better understand his relationship with the Bride.In this entry Tarantino specifically pays homage to the action films of both the east and west, specifically the chopsocky and spaghetti western sub-genres. To this end we have an extended training sequence where the Bride is taught by a martial arts expert, while we also have much Ennio Morricone music on the soundtrack and a cowboy villain to boot. The 'Kill Bills' were probably the least interesting dialogue movies Tarantino has ever delivered, they are much more minimal in this department and much more interested in visuals and action. The writing is still good enough though and more important in the second part than the first certainly. David Carradine finally appears as Bill, I remember thinking at the time that it felt like an eternity before we finally saw him which was as much to do with the idea of this film first being mentioned shortly after Tarantino completed Jackie Brown (1997), so it was a good six or seven years between then until we finally saw Bill on screen in this movie. It was an epic amount of time but Carradine is certainly a good choice in the role and it was nice to see a true b-movie actor get such a prominent billing (no pun intended). The rest of the cast do fine but this is less of an actor's movie than Tarantino normally delivers, it's far more about the overall spectacle and set-pieces. I would probably be inclined to rank this one as the least of Tarantino's movies so far, although that is admittedly a relative statement as I still was very entertained by it.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
44,KineticSeoul,"Good, but not a masterpiece",7,8 September 2010,"I sort of liked the first Kill Bill better although this one is more about the plot and the dialogue which is Tarantino's trademark. It doesn't have much of the stylized violence from the first one, but this is still a very good follow up and very entertaining. Although there are points in the film it started to drag a bit, the dialogue is witty and interesting so those slow parts are actually forgivable. The interaction between the characters is also much better than the first. Although I am with the majority of people that enjoyed the first vol better than the second, this is still a good movie. But not really a masterpiece like some people claim it to be. Carradine that played Bill is the main highlight of this film.7.9/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
45,OllieSuave-007,Artistically done action sequel.,8,4 March 2014,"This is director Quentin Tarantino's sequel to his action epic, Kill Bill Vol. 1. The intriguing story about the vengeful ""The Bride"" (Uma Thurman) continues as she seeks ultimate justice against her traitor, Bill (David Carradine), leader of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. This time, the Bride battles Bill's younger brother Budd (Michael Madsen), and Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah) in an epic tour de force to get to Bill.This movie continues the artistry over substance method, delving into Chinese and Japanese martial arts, which are more emphasized as the Bride's intense and grueling martial arts training with the commanding and powerful master Pai Mei (Gordan Liu) are depicted in large parts of the movie. The Bride learns to wield swords, punch out wood and be swift with her hands - a spectacle to watch. Instead of a flowing plot, this movie like its prequel is divided into chapters, with each section delving into one of the Bride's mission or trainings and the ultimate battle between her and Elle Driver, which I thought were one of two best fighting scenes in both movies (the other is the battle with Gogo Yubari in the first film). The fight with Driver is extremely intense and mesmerizing to watch.The filmmakers again captured the tension and sensitivity in each chapter, making the audience aware of the assassins' danger and the Bride's hunger for revenge. The main problem ***spoiler*** I had with this movie was that the climatic battle between the Bride and Bill was very short. You would think that after going through so much sweat, blood and tears, the final battle would be more epic and grand. Yet, Bill didn't show much of his moves or proved he was a force to be reckon with.But, this is still one of most intense action movies I've seen, and one with the largest supply of bloody action with explicit gore. So, there is also a warning label for people attempting to watch this.Grade B+",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
46,Buddy-51,even better than Vol. 1,8,11 October 2005,"Unlike its predecessor, ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1,"" which was basically a triumph of style over substance, the follow-up, ""Kill Bill, Vol. 2"" is a triumph of both style AND substance - a no-holds-barred action film that turns into a thinking man's thriller in its climactic scene. This installment picks up where the earlier one left off, with Beatrix Kiddo, the former assassin attempting to go straight, still seeking revenge against the people who killed her fiancé and friends, and left her for dead on the eve of her wedding. Beatrix, an expert at swordsmanship and martial arts, follows an inexorable path of destruction, culminating in a brilliantly choreographed showdown with the Bill of the title, her former lover and hit man boss who decided to turn his gun on her when she ran off and left him. But the surprise - and triumph - here is that the showdown turns out to be one not of bullets and blows, but of words and ideas.The plotting could not be more simple and direct, a series of cat-and-mouse fight scenes, periodically interrupted by flashbacks showing how Beatrix got to where she is today. Quentin Tarantino's trademark dialogue is sharp, imaginative and witty, and the violence is a fascinating hybrid of the cartoon-like and the graphic. Tarantino is a lover of movies and this is reflected in the stylish look and sound of the film: the beautiful compositions, the bizarre camera angles, the razor-sharp editing, and the glorious soundtrack, all of which make this an eye-filling and ear-caressing experience for the viewer.Uma Thurman delivers a pitch-perfect performance as Beatrix, bringing a mixture of steely-eyed ferocity and warmhearted tenderness - as well as an amazing athleticism - to the role. She is more than matched by Keith Caradine as the terrifying yet strangely likable Bill - and their final confrontation scene, in which these two natural born killers sit down and discuss both their love and hatred for one another before squaring off in their battle to the death, is amazingly compelling in its complexity and depth. It is here where the ""Kill Bill"" saga finally becomes a work of art. As a result, this second film is a more satisfying work overall than the first. But, taken as a whole, this is certainly Tarantino's best work since the seminal ""Pulp Fiction"" from ten years earlier.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
47,thesar-2,"See, I told you we had unfinished business",9,26 November 2009,"Honestly, I wasn't anticipating Kill Bill Vol. 2 to be better than Vol. 1. In fact, I thought I would be bored since I already knew Tarantino generally cuts back on the action and ups the dialogue in the second half of his story lines.Of course, I had to see the finale of the seriesso far. (Again, I'm not looking forward to a Vol. 3 – spoiler alert, I don't want to see ""The Bride"" die, like the future setup movie it's sounds like it might be.) I was NOT disappointed. In fact, Vol. 2 is actually better.While Thurman still does an excellent job – her best performance (EVER) was in Vol. 1-2, everyone else stepped up their game. Madsen, as always, was great and Hannah was perfect. Even (new to the series, character) Esteban (Parks) was wonderful. But the scene-stealer award goes to the late Carradine, God rest his soul. Honestly, as many things that were masterful about this movie, he was worth the entire admission price.Plot line: ""The Bride"" continues down her revenge path and continues to get knocked down in the process. Way down, like 6-feet-under, literally in one scene.More background is revealed, as well as more subplots. And the obvious final confrontation with Bill and her daughter – no spoiler, since that was foretold in Vol. 1.While the action is cut down in Vol. 2, the plot, dialogue, suspense and plot moves forward in fast-motion. Tarantino again delivers, but this time, 2-fold. And with the finale speech from Carradine, it ends on a perfect note. (It helps I'm a huge Superman fan.) Not to be redundant from my Vol. 1 review, again, everything works in this movie: Music, score, style, acting, originality, suspense, action, cinematography and dialogue. Everyone should see both Vol. 1 and 2. I loved all the actors in this movie, especially the extended roles of Carradine and Parks.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
48,cherold,more successful than volume 1,8,20 March 2005,"I had been fairly underwhelmed by Kill Bill Volume 1, which I thought was entertaining but shallow and rather pointless. But I still watched Volume 2, because I had only watched Volume 1 because I thought the trailer for Volume 2 looked good, and Volume 1 came to cable first.Since these movies apparently are really just two halves of one long movie, it is surprising that the second one feels somewhat more mature. Yes, it still has juvenile things in it that only an arrested 17-year-old would put in, like Pai Mei's playing with his mustache in that ridiculous way, but overall it feels meatier. It is also less gory, which is surprising.Much of the sense of maturity is due to David Carradine's first rate performance as Bill. It is tempting to say Bill has an undercurrent of menace, but the interesting thing is he virtually doesn't. Carradine is calm and quite likable and the sense of menace comes entirely from our knowledge of how dangerous he is. His thoughtful character makes the entire movie feel more thoughtful, although this isn't to say that it isn't usually still silly and over-the-top. There's also an excellent bit by Darryl Hannah.The question is, if you played these two as one movie, would I rate it an 8 star movie, like volume 2 or 7 star movie like 1? I can't really decide. Much of the problem with the first one is the hollow feeling one is left with at the end, so the second half could well elevate the whole movie. On the other hand, I don't if I could sit through a 4-hour Kill Bill. It is entertaining, but it is still very much a one-note movie.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

50,Robert_duder,I eat my words!!,9,1 September 2005,"Yes I said I never liked Quentin Tarantino. Yes I boycotted seeing this film and it's previous installment because I was furious that Tarantino continually gets more popular despite his constant attempts at being so called different and outrageous. He tries too hard and I still stand by that but when it comes to the amazing and brilliant Kill Bill Series, I gladly and whole heartedly eat my words.The two Kill Bill volumes are as different as they are important to each other. They are both very much from the same series and the story continues over completely but nonetheless they are very very different and in that Tarantino finally finds some actual uniqueness. He managed to create two completely different films that are directly sequels of each other and keep getting better. The first Kill Bill was action packed, gore, constant non stop revenge whereas the second installment is softer in a grotesque kind of way. The initial fiery revenge has calmed some but ""The Bride's"" self imposed mission has not changed. Instead in Volume 2 all the characters and actors get the opportunity to really show some acting ability with more emotion than the original. Uma Thurman is still brilliant (and I was never a fan before) as The Bride. She will be one of the most memorable film characters in history. Her anger, and emotions, and in this volume we get to see where all this hatred and vengeance stems from. At the same time we get to see her brought to her knees by the one last thing she feels real human emotion for...her daughter. The battles and enemies in Volume Two are no less amazing then they were in volume one. Michael Madsen's character is a little underused but credit must be given to him as the only one who actually nearly stops The Bride's rampage. Daryl Hannah, who gave us a glimpse of her deadly character Elle Driver becomes a full fledged enemy in Volume 2. She is deadly and deceitful and wicked and their fight in the tiny, cramped trailer is awesome. Perhaps one of the best things about Volume 2 is the intense history we are treated to. Whereas Volume One opened a can of questions Volume 2 answers them all right from the beginning. We hear Bill, we know a little about him but we never see him in the original. Why was The Bride at that chapel, how did she get there, who is she, what is her history? Right from the beginning we see Bill, we get to know the history between them and what was going on during the execution.One of the best things in the film is seeing where and when The Bride became such a gruesome, awesome killing machine at the hands of legendary Oriental Judo master Pai Mei. The shining star of Kill Bill Volume 2 is none other than Bill himself. David Carradine creates one of the most scary, brutal, maniacal, calculating killers and evil bad guys in film history. His voice and mannerisms can't help but give you shivers. This is without a doubt his most brilliant role. I was mildly disappointed at the brief encounter and battle between him and The Bride and how easily he is defeated although in a way it's poetic justice and makes sense...or...maybe that wasn't his defeat?? I think with what Tarantino has done with Volume's one and two it's safe to say he could do a smart and worthy volume three. I have a whole new respect for his direction and this series. It's captivating and original and stylish and classic film already. 9/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
51,ElMaruecan82,"Thank you, Master Tarantino for the 'Kill Bill' series ...",10,31 July 2011,"""Kill Bill Vol. 1"" ended with the revelation of The Bride's daughter being alive and this last shocking finale couldn't have made us wait three years for a conclusion, it was a 'to be continued' ending inviting for a direct continuation that would also feature elements preceding the first Volume and completing it with a necessary level of depth. So, to call ""Vol. 2"" a sequel or a prequel is irrelevant, as the two movies make one, and constitute Quentin Tarantino's greatest cinematic achievement after ""Pulp Fiction"".Creativity is like a second skin for Tarantino, it's amazing how each chapter exudes a unique atmosphere. ""Vol. 2"" never ceases to amaze us when we already got our share of adrenalin and emotions in the first opus, and I think the secret is very easy to spot, it's somewhat located in your heart and it's the ability of Tarantino to touch you right there. Action is one thing, but the movie excels even more in its portrayal of the motives that drives the action. And one recurring element in ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" more than any other, is the repetition of flashbacks whether shown or told, lengthy or furtive. The whole chapter involving the initiation with Pai-Mei is a great homage to the traditional Martial Arts films, and another enrichment of our knowledge about the Bride, finally known as Beatrix Kiddo, and the relationship with her Master. This aspect is crucial not only to justify her use of a special move to get out of a coffin, but also during the sword-fight when Elle Driver reveals how she killed Pai-Mei, indirectly informing us how she lost her eye. This fight closes the character's arc of Elle Driver and makes the revenge even more delectable, the 'Kill Bill and the Squad' thing getting a bit old.The fascinating aspect is how the film relies on the psychological element as Bea doesn't have the monopoly of motives. When we finally discover Bill, we have some insights about the significance of his acts. In the first flashback, Bill promises not to be a 'killjoy', but there's something odd in that whole chapter. Again the editing of the scenes helps the narrative in an decisive way, if the massacre had introduced the whole series, we would have been terribly shocked. But now that we know what a killer the Bride is, there's something disappointingly odd to see her, in a lousy chapel with these giggling chicks, and that blonde-haired schmuck for a husband. Something doesn't feel right. I'm not saying we would have rooted for Bill, but at least understood him. The last conversation between Bill and Beatrix goes even further in the development of Bill, proving how a fascinating character he is, and a suiting villain for such a heroine like Kiddo.The masterstroke in the screenplay is the serum truth, a poetical device to be sure that we all get everything, after all, the Volume 2 is here to conclude, to answer the questions without asking others. And we understand that Bea left Bill because she wanted to spare her daughter from growing under a bad influence, which quite justify Bill's anger, who thought his protégée was dead. On the other hand, Bea knew she was lying to herself with that wedding thing. So there are three truths in the Kill Bill series. First, you cannot escape from your past. Bill had to be back, and Bea's lies ignited his anger and caused the massacre. Secondly, you cannot escape from revenge, Bill's brother, Michael Madsen as Budd, knew it, and says in a poignant brotherly discussion that all the squad deserves to die. And third, you cannot escape from your nature, Bea was a killer, and the whole revenge against Bill let her express her most innate violent impulses  and as she conceded, the blood poisoned by the truth serum, she enjoyed those killings. The tragedy of Bea is that her nature as a killer inspired her, in a motherly protective move, to get B.B., her daughter, away from Bill. And seeing her shooting for fun, senselessly talking about a dead fish or watching 'Shogun Assassin' to get sleepy says a lot about Bill's education.The depth in ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" allowed the climax to be more meaningful, Bea had to kill Bill, less for the chapel massacre than to protect her daughter. The reasons changed and so did the fight style. When we expected another blood-fest, the climactic fight begins and ends abruptly with the five point palm-exploding heart technique that catches Bill and us by surprise. Bea didn't tell that Pai-Meei taught her the technique, why? Because she's bad, or just because she, like any others, wants to win the fight, and it's the perfect ending, as we tasted enough blood to rather appreciate an emotional farewell. The next morning, we find Bea with B.B. in a motel. This time, BB doesn't watch 'Shogun Assassin' but a simple cartoon, showing that things are changing for the better. And in the bathroom, Beatrix cries with an euphoria that sounds like the hangover following the blood-drunkenness provided by so much killings, or was it just the after-effect of the truth serum? Never mind, she joins her daughter to let us breath and celebrate the happy ending of a glorious saga.The ending credits reminds us that what we've seen is just a movie, a homage to a genre ... but what a movie! what a colorful gallery of characters who penetrated our Pop Culture memories : The Bride, Bill, O'Ren, the Crazy 88, Pai Mei  ""Kill Bill Vol 2"" is an extraordinary homage to the worshiped Martial Arts genre with some Neo-western elements, there's this agonizing feeling of an end approaching, and the creative destruction incarnated by the Bride piercing the coffin as to prove once and for all, that these genres are not dead, Tarantino as God-like 'CineMaster' resurrected them.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
52,paul2001sw-1,"Will someone kill Quentin now, please?",4,5 July 2007,"OK, I don't really want Quentin Tarantino to be killed - actually, I am a big fan of his earlier films. But the 'Kill Bill' films are not in their league, all style and no substance. Volume 1 at least had a fast pace, its innovations coming quick and fast; but Volume 2 of this over-long project seems to add nothing new except for a layer of emotional interpretation that its grotesque, cartoonish characters can scarcely sustain. Volume 1 pastiched a huge range of different styles of film; Volume 2, at times, appears simply as a pastiche of a bad movie (and very hard to distinguish from a genuinely bad film to boot). Yet I can't help but feel that within these two movies (originally conceived as one very long film) there's a highly original shorter film that should have been made. When the saga ends with a credits sequence in which Tarantino appears to pay homage to himself, one can't help but wonder whether even the most talented of individuals don't sometimes benefit when someone else has the final cut.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

'Kill Bill: Vol 2 (2004)' connects with the audience much more than the first, providing a more engaging and entertaining experience. This actually leads me to believe that this story would've been better suited as a single film that combined the best of both parts. 7/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
54,bowmanblue,Slow and steady wins the race,8,3 August 2014,"I'm guessing that most people won't have decided to watch 'Kill Bill Volume 2' without watching the first instalment. So, if you've already seen the first half, you may be expecting something similar from the final act. However, whereas the first half was a blood-soaked massacre of bodies and mayhem, this one is anything but.I won't say exactly how many people 'The Bride' kills in this one (and it's nowhere near the seemingly infinite number of ninjas she chopped up in Part 1), but there's a big clue in the title! Yes, 'Volume 2' is a very slow film. In many ways it's more like a Tarantino film that its predecessor. It's very 'talkie' – there are tonnes of long, drawn-out scenes where characters natter to each other, seemingly going nowhere. It just is. It's there to build character. However, if you're not partial to that sort of scene, then you probably won't enjoy this part.As with the first half, there are a handful of scenes that you probably feel could have been left on the cutting room floor, but, all in all, it's a pretty solid film. Yes, it's not fast-paced; it's almost deliberately slow – like the 'ying' to Part 1's 'yang.' Fans of Tarantino will probably love it anyway, but anyone who likes broodingly slow film with clever dialogue should enjoy it, too.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
55,dromasca,That's Entertainment,9,7 May 2004,"Take 'Kill Bill' for what it is - good escapetionist entertainment, and you have good chances to enjoy it. Judge it according to art cinema criteria, and you risk to not like it and miss the fun. Terentino may be one of the most talented film makers around, but his violent and beautiful films are not meant to be more than entertainment, and folks looking for big artistic messages are searching in the wrong place. 'Kill Bill' is a revenge story, as many were written for the big screen since the beginning of the Western history. There is not too much originality in the story - what is different is the art of film making, the smart mix of quotes from all what Terentino likes in the history of cinema, from spaghetti westerns to classic Japanese samurai films, the soundtrack, and of course the unmistakable touch of non-censored violence so typical to Terentino. Overall, the film is entertaining. I saw it on DVD, and I cannot wait for volume 2 release on DVD, so I intent to see it tomorrow in the theater. 8/10 on my personal scale.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
56,dromasca,Better than vol. 1,9,8 May 2004,"I posted mistakenly yesterday a comment that was intended to be for vol. 1. After seeing the first 'Kill Bill' on DVD, I ran to the theaters and saw vol. 2 today - it is better.One may argue whether making violent films about killers is moral. Still if morality of the times is a criteria, many art works would have never made it. 'Kill Bill' is a very good film, vol. 2 explains everything is important in a logical manner, it is superbly filmed and acted - a real treat. As vol. 1 was, vol.2 is full of cinema quotes from Terentino's masters, and for the cinema lovers this is really fun. Action film fans will find less of their preferred stuff in the second film. This did not bother me at all. What I got in exchange is the really tremendous acting of David Carradine. I never forgot what a wonderful actor he can be, but I did not see him in any important film since the 80s. Here he is back, and I hope his acting will not be forgotten until the next Oscars - he deserves at least a nomination in my opinion.
A few words about the ending. Leaving things un-explained as they were at the end of vol. 1 is a better artistic bet. Explaining has its problems, and explaining in films needs to conform to some rules. I think that the script and the director did a good job on this - not perfect, but very good indeed.
9/10 on my personal scale. the best film of this year so far.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
57,MLDinTN,less action than volume 1,7,21 February 2005,"I think volume 1 was better because volume 2 dragged in bits and wasn't as entertaining. Volume 2 starts off slow as we see what happened between the Bride and Bill before the massacre at the church. We have a good fight scene between the Bride and Elle but it leaves the ending up in the air. Then there's Bud, who ""disposes"" of the Bride, which brings about the flashbacks of her training. She gets out of the coffin after being buried alive. Now that'a neat trick. But she doesn't get to take care of Bud, someone else does. Then the final act shows the Bride tracking down Bill and meeting her daughter. The two talk, but she's there to get revenge, so it can end in only one way. The final confrontation isn't that eventful. It's anti-climatic.I guess my favorite scenes involved the training of Beatrix by Master Pai Mai. How many times was he going to flick his beard.FINAL VERDICT: Definitely see it if you've seen volume 1. I would have liked it better if it had more fights like volume 1.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
58,gbill-74877,"Entertaining, and completes the story",8,26 September 2019,"Highlights:
Completes the story and fills out the characters.Uma Thurman is perfect in the lead role. The scenes where she's training under the old master, Pai Mei (Gordon Parks) are fantastic.The buried alive scene is horrifying and iconic.The black mamba and ensuing fight between Daryl Hannah (Elle) and Thurman is also very satisfying.The fish out of water analogy for life/death, and the comments about Superman/Clark Kent during an otherwise slow scene. It's an action film but Tarantino occasionally sprinkles in some wonderful bits of dialogue or monologue.As usual with Tarantino, the homage to these genres and the sheer joy of filmgoing really comes through.Lowlights:
David Carradine as Bill. Far too old at 68, lisping through his dialogue-heavy scenes, and not nearly strong and menacing enough. The final chapter was pretty tepid.Pacing was too slow, particularly early and late (starting with the weak scene with the pimp). It seems the right balance was not found between the two films, and it would have been much better tightened up and a single film, 2.5 to 3 hours long.The two instances in this volume (to go with one in the first) of female characters intent on killing one another and immediately stopping because a child is present (in one case, in utero) gets a little ridiculous. After being shot in the face, raped over years in a hospital, sliced up and shot some more, buried alive, etc she's going to stop to make sandwiches and cuddle? It's an homage to strong women characters who can also be mothers which is great, but these bits ring false, culminating in that ultra-cheesy last line about the lioness rejoining her cub.Still though, despite all my gripes, it's a very fun film. Tarantino sets the bar higher with everything he puts into his films, and sometimes it's easy to forget that in critiquing them. While we can see where this one is going, we really have no idea what he's going to put on the screen next, and he's always entertaining.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Uma Thurman really fits in well with her character. But, I really liked Daryl Hannah as Elle. I would not want to cross her or her black mamba.Overall, this is a great movie to watch.

All the characters are just wonderful once again, and the story is brilliant, plus Uma Thurman, David Carradine and Daryl Hannah are all simply amazing in this!. OK granted there is nowhere near as much as the amazing action that the 1st had, however while Kill Bill is one of my favorite films, I just felt the story was better here, plus it was cool to see the opening fully this time!. To me the finale was one of the most emotional I have seen in a long time, and i'll admit I was sad to see Bill go, plus the dialog is just brilliant. For me it was very different from the 1st film, and a gross out scene for me is when Beatrix plucks out Elle's eyeball and squishes it with her foot!, plus the buried alive scene was great but rather disturbing as well. The fight scene between Ellie and Beatrix is now one of my personal favorites and the training scenes with Pai Mei and Beatrix were really cool as well, plus David Carradine's superhero theory was really cool!.It was awesome to see Beatrix bonding with her daughter and I really dug the relationship between Uma and Carradine as they had fantastic chemistry together, plus the ending was just perfect. Even at almost a 140 minutes it's never over long and Uma Thurman gives an even better performance this time around! plus Michael Madsen's character was really cool as well!. It's extremely well made and written, and I loved how they gave Carradine, Hannah and Madsen a lot more to do this time! plus the music is very good in this once again. Like the 1st Kill Bill this deserves to be in the top 250 and while I couldn't stand Pai Mei's character Chia Hui Liu did his job extremely well! plus it has many surprising and shocking moments throughout!. All the characters are extremely likable once again , and while the main fight between Beatrix and Bill was disappointing and too short, it fit the film well, however it's nowhere near as violent as the 1st!. This is even better then the original in my opinion as its my favorite of Tarantino's along with Pulp Fictionm with an emotional finale and outstanding performances, and if you haven't seen it and loved Kill Bill like me do so immediately you shouldn't regret it!.The Direction is once again practically flawless!. Quentin Tarantino does a perfect job here with amazing camera work, wonderful angles, good use of colors and lots of other stylish and cool shots as well, plus he kept the film at an extremely fast pace!.The Acting is incredible!. Uma Thurman is stunningly gorgeous and is amazing as always, she is even better this time around, kicks that ass, had some great dialog, had fantastic chemistry with David Carradine, was incredibly convincing in her emotional scenes, was really likable, and it was cool to see more of her past this time around,she was amazing! (Uma Rules!!!!!!!). David Carradine is amazing here as Bill, he gave a charming show, had some very classy lines, had fantastic chemistry with Uma, and I was really sad to see him go, I was so happy they gave a lot more to do here! (Carradine Rules!!). Chia Hui Liu is extremely convincing as Pai Mei unfortunately I couldn't stand his character, he was extremely unlikable and cruel to Uma's character, much too arrogant and classless, still that's what his job was and he did it very very well. Michael Madsen is fantastic as Budd, he was funny, and had a really cool character I liked him a lot. Daryl Hannah is extremely hot, and is amazing here, she was so evil, and I absolutely loved it, I wish she didn't go so soon though!. Samuel L. Jackson has a cool cameo (Jackson Rules!!!). Rest of the cast do fine.Overall If you loved Kill Bill then please go see this if you haven't, you shouldn't regret it!. ***** out of 5",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
63,Bored_Dragon,Kill Bill: Vol. 1 & 2,10,26 May 2018,"At the time ""Kill Bill"" came out, movies were a totally minor thing in my life. I watched them relatively often, but I did not pay any attention to ""details"". I had no idea who the director was, and the question is whether I knew at all what the director was. Besides Uma Thurman, I think I never heard of other actors back then. I rated movies on a very simple scale - whether it's fun or not. This one was fun for a ten. Fifteen years and several thousand films later, I look at movies from a completely different angle and ""fun"" is no longer at the top of the criteria that distinguish good movies from bad ones. Now I analyze them in more detail and I still haven't found any flaws in this one.It could be said that Quentin Tarantino's talent is a gift from God, but I think it's far more likely that he sold his soul to the Devil. The lowest rating I have ever given to one of his films is nine, and I'm not a ""fanboy"". ""Kill Bill"" is an action thriller, and for me action films are the lowest form of the seventh art. But Tarantino's ability to create an action movie which is also an art film is fascinating. The story is crazy and great, but the least important. Camera work, fight choreography, use of color and sound and feeling for details make this film a masterpiece of cinema. The cast is more than good, and Tarantino manages to get the most out of them. I doubt that any of these actors have ever given a better performance than in this movie. And, of course, music! Music is very diverse, totally unexpected, often even unsuitable for the scenes it follows, yet again in such a perfect (dis)harmony with the divine scenery and crazy choreography, that it all leaves the viewer breathless.

Less violence, more character - Volume 2 goes where most movie dare not tread - character development and slow-moving dialogue with a superb David Carradine in a Best-Supporting Actor performance working with an amazing script and subtle complex series of acting and expressional, mysterious, ominous wit. Uma Thurman explodes onto the screen with full facial exposure in black and white as well as color. The plot-twists abound, the world is turned upside down in both silence and loud crashing drama, in pitch darkness and blazing heated fury.The old style Western movie music, the samurai Japanese style genre, the humor, the violence all are blended, folded and fused into a perfect piece of cinema that throws the whole direction of Volume One into another dimension. This powerfully emotional, sometimes funny drama, action, mystery, martial arts genre bursts through into a new creative, cinematic experience. Unleashed from the prior expectations and assumption of Volume 1, this movie both irritates, frustrates and re-directs its focus into another world of ""Kill Bill"" with its refocused emphasis and toned down sword play and more cerebral manifestation of dialogue and careful, singular artistry of martial arts.Oscar nominations for Kill Bill Volume 2 (best picture) Quentin Tarantino (best director & writing) Uma Thurman (best actor & writing) David Carradine (bestsupporting male performance) Michael Madsen (best supporting male performance) Robert Richardson (best cinematography) and Oscar nominations for sound and film editing",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
65,slightlymad22,Should Have Been One Movie,8,14 August 2019,"I just watched Kill Bill Vol 2There are too many scenes in this film that damage the pacing. It feels very bloated at times. Rather than flowing smoothly, it lurches from point-to-point, giving screen time to secondary characters who are neither colorful enough nor intriguing enough to warrant it. This is the case of a director having fallen too much in love with his material. The result is that much of Volume 2, for all of its strengths, is self-indulgent. About 50% of the movie is used to provide backstory.That's the bad news. The good news is that, despite its flaws, it's still a good movie. There's much less action, a lot more talking (Although much of the dialogue isn't vintage Tarantino, except a scene like Bill's ""Superman"" monologue), and a legitimate effort to build the characters.Put the two parts together, and Tarantino has made a masterful saga that celebrates the martial arts genre while kidding it, loving it, and transcending it.Tonally, the two films are different, which may be the result of the split. Hopefully, Tarantino's original, single-movie cut of Kill Bill will eventually be available on DVD. With the two parts re-knitted and much of the extraneous material removed, this could be a great motion picture, right up there with Pulp Fiction. As it currently stands, Kill Bill is a victim of its director's ego and its distributor's greed. The moments of greatness make it worth seeing, and there's certainly plenty of entertainment to be found here, but it's hard not to lament what might have beenKill Bill Volume 2 grossed $66 million dollars (against a $40 million dollar budget) at the domestic box office.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

69,tomgillespie2002,A fitting end to Tarantinos revenge saga,7,20 March 2016,"While the decision to split Kill Bill, originally intended as a three-hour epic tale of revenge, into two separate movies was greeted by fans with accusations of greed. Whether this is true or whether the full version of Quentin Tarantino's homage to 70's exploitation was simply too much to consume in one sitting, it actually turns out to be a masterstroke. Volumes 1 and 2 incorporate two vastly different styles, both of which allow Tarantino to fully indulge his love for kung-fu movies and spaghetti westerns with ample time and care. These are two different movies, never forgetting that the character linking them together is Uma Thurman's determined The Bride.Having dispatched O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) in the first film, we first meet The Bride as she drives to her final target - Bill (David Carradine). To even consider this a spoiler would be failing to grasp the movies Tarantino is tipping his hat to, and the director makes a point of this by constantly shifting around the time-line. It's not so much about if she'll achieve her goal, but just how cool it will be when she does. Bill remained off screen for the bulk of Volume 1, seen either stroking his samurai sword and talking menacingly off-camera, but we meet him in his full glory almost instantly in Volume 2, as we are shown an extended version of the events that left The Bride shot in the head and left for dead.First though, she must face Budd (Michael Madsen) and the one-eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah). Budd is a tough, hard-drinking redneck working as a bouncer when he's not clumsily making margaritas in his trailer, and he is given a generous amount of screen-time and isn't let down by Madsen's gravelly performance. Similar to Tarantino's early films Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994), Budd's story is given a patient build-up before the burst of inevitable violence, portraying him as a beaten man awaiting his death at the hands of the woman he knows is coming for him. Just when his fate seems sealed, Tarantino slaps us in the face and turns his protagonists fortunes on their head, allowing for some down-time as we flash-back to The Bride's training with the formidable Pai Mei (Gordon Liu).Pai Mei's chapter is the entire saga's crowning achievement, full of ridiculous crash-zooms and beard stroking that manages to poke fun at the genre, while at the same time warmly embracing and even transcending it. This leads The Bride to her face-off with Elle, which is a scene of such ferocity, humour and sheer bad-assery that it more than makes up for the creeping pace. As Bill, Carradine is a revelation, with Tarantino once again pulling an iconic actor out of obscurity to riff on the type of role they became famous for in the first place to deliver the performance of their career. An early version of the script had The Bride and Bill duelling to a sunset backdrop, but the low-key scrap opted for instead seems more fitting. Towards the climax, it seems that Tarantino is struggling with how to end his epic tale of revenge, but some minor bumps don't derail what is undoubtedly the most Tarantino-y of his catalogue, and certainly his most all-out fun.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
70,Thanos_Alfie,As good as the first...,8,15 March 2021,"""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" is an Action - Crime movie and the sequel of ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"", in which we watch the bride continuing her quest for revenge. Her vengeance leads her to the other members of the group of assassins and her former boss and lover Bill.I liked the sequel of ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" as much as the first movie. It continued its successful pattern, the plot was very interesting and it contained many information that was easy for the audience to understand and follow the movie. The direction which was made by Quentin Tarantino was for one more time simply amazing and his touch was obvious through the whole duration of it. The interpretations of both Uma Thurman who played as Beatrix Kiddo and David Carradine who played as Bill were very good. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Daryl Hannah's who played as Elle, Michael Madsen's who played as Budd and Chia-Hui Liu's who played as Johnny / Pai Mei.

71,Floated2,An Improvement over Vol. 1,7,30 June 2017,"Kill Bill Vol. 2 is the sequel one year later than the original processor Kill Bill. Being released as two separate parts within a year of each other, Quentin Tarantino understood what he was getting at. Volume 2 in this franchise lays out more of a plot, more in depth and remains more focus than the original. There is more suspense and thrills and it is overall a more entertaining and intriguing watch. Mainly thanks of David Carradine's portrayal as Bill, as he has more screen time and answers are answered more regarding his relationship with The Bride (however her name was revealed).Though what is less than stellar and quite disappointing is the final showdown between the Bride and Bill. We understood the main purpose of the film is the revenge of the Bride against Bill and the build up was all for a chaotic scene between the two, but what is left happening doesn't live up to the hype, as nothing mesmerizing occurs between the two. Though leading up to the final end scenes, occurs key and important scenes involving both the Bride and Bill, and introducing their four year old daughter. This was well done. The bride was also less aggressive and more persistent in Vol. 2 which made her character more likable as we got a better understanding at her backstory.

72,johnnyboyz,"Marred by its sporadic nature and constant post-modern references but it offers a few brief, if effective, scenes of a harrowing and heart wrenching nature.",6,25 November 2008,"The second volume of Kill Bill marks Tarantino's first failing as a director; it's a minute failing but it's a failing all the same. What is Kill Bill: Volume 2 other than a nicely shot and well acted freak show that follows a revenge story arc but not really as we know it? By the time we are within sight of the finish line, we will have encountered eighty year old pimps sitting and chatting in chairs mumbling about where a certain someone is; we will have encountered Bill, after he was kept anonymous in the first film, playing a pipe of some sort and we will have spent a couple of scenes with a former international assassin who's now living out his days as a Redneck.It's these sorts of people and these sorts of scenes that make Kill Bill: Volume 2 the mismatch film that it is. It's a lot of good ideas and one or two harrowing scenes basically patched together around a basic revenge goal. The film is not the complete experience but then again the film was chopped into two halves anyway and the result is one part brilliant, brutal and engaging (volume 1); one part drawn out, slow and unrewarding (volume 2).You remember individual scenes from Volume 2, you don't remember the full product as an experience. Sure, the burial scene is harrowing and the scene in which The Bride (Thurman) has a certain encounter with a certain someone nearer the end will tug at a lot of people's heartstrings and the sure, individual shots of The Bride walking amongst the heat wave and the bizarre crash zooms into Pai Mei's (Hui Liu) face as a he strokes his beard in a nonchalant fashion stay with you for reasons of a sporadic nature. These moments are memorable, if not rather good but the frustrations lie in the referencing to other texts for the sake of being post-modern and the consistency with the characters.Bending the lines between reality, fantasy, realism and escapism; The Bride sits in a car and delivers a monologue to the camera about how she's going to 'Kill Bill' at the film's very beginning. She even makes a comparison between herself and a movie, likening herself to a 'roaring rampage of revenge' reminding us that this is just a film after all. Then Tarantino chucks in what he does best in terms of manipulating narratives and that's including flashbacks as well as flashbacks within flashbacks. The Bride's first encounter with Bill (Carradine) and the general scenes around the wedding chapel early on work well through the menace Bill brings to the screen. It's effective because we know thanks to the first film what's to come, it is a matter of getting to that point and how it all plays out that is the suspense. Even stranger, Bill comes across as relatively well mannered, even nice, with his soft tone and slow, relatively passive movements that further create illusions of his true persona. It's no coincidence Tarantino selects the side angle when the two come face to face for the first time – the sort of composition that creates that 'face off' scenario.Additionally, Tarantino gives space to Budd (Masden) to grow ever so slightly. Budd's early interaction with his boss for being late for his shift at work leads us down a route of possible confrontation but Budd is passive and lacks that killer instinct – something we wouldn't associate with an assassin. This makes his lack of ruthlessness toward The Bride later on all the more effective and instead, we get a harrowing burial scene rather than an upfront execution. All the villains in the film are sadistic but simplistic; they manage to think up crude and downright nasty ways to eliminate their foes, be it a live burial or a snake in a briefcase but there doesn't seem to be any real flow to it all.The antagonism flits around the place; in volume 1 Bill is a mysterious unseen figure of all thigs sadistic, the next he is playing a flute by a campfire. Tarantino deployed this tactic in Pulp Fiction with Marcellus Wallace and it worked even when we finally saw his face, but here it falls rather flat. The film is a freak show of one eyed kung-fu femme fatales; 80 year old pimps whose whores have populated nearby villages with their young, thus taking the surrounding areas for the old man and comic book spouting psychopaths who have developed their own truth serum. The truth to this is that I think Tarantino gets carried away with himself – it's as if he reaches a certain height and then tries to top himself further with more outlandish content. This is particularly significant towards the end when Bill's luxurious house plays out as the setting for the final confrontation, but it's more of a circus than a bad guy's lair.Some of the best scenes are scrubbed out by some of the more unbelievable and just plain silly. The Bride's interaction with an assassin in a hotel room feels awkwardly out of place and just plain daft whereas Pai Mei's constant laughing and beard stroking to crash zooms feels like a pastiche too far, no matter how potentially enjoyable in a guilty manner. But that's the key word: 'potentially'. The film feels like a missed opportunity, a film that with a calmer head and a more focused eye might have been pretty good. As it is, it's good in individual sections but actually pretty forgettable in the long run.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
73,filipemanuelneto,Just who loves Tarantino will understand the film.,4,24 July 2016,"In this film, the second of two, the bride gets her revenge against Bill, the groom who nearly killed her in the day of their wedding. Directed and written by Quentin Tarantino, the film stars Uma Thurman and David Carradine.This movie is the sequel of ""Kill Bill (Vol. 1)"", so the criticism I made for the first film almost fit perfectly in this second film. Tarantino thought both films as one. And I start by saying that I like some of the films that Tarantino has done, but I believe that Kill Bill was one of the worst of his career as a director.The film deserves applause for the performance of the actors, the good soundtrack and the good special, visual and sound effects. The main problem of this film is the non-linear narrative. It was a negative option because it makes everything more confusing than ever would be normally. Yes, because this movie is confusing and mixes film and filmmaking styles that have no apparent connection (it's rare to see a Japanese martial arts film with logical connection to the universe of American western). As I said to the first film, a person who knows nothing about this movie and never read anything about it, don't understand it. Luckily, this film can, after all, to frame the events in a more logical way than the first film, where scenes seem much more isolated from each other.The film's screenplay is interesting, although it has been virtually copied from another movie ( ""Lady Snowblood""). But despite the basic idea is good (the bride betrayed by her groom, abandoned at the altar and nearly murdered in his own marriage), the way the film develops that is quite negative. The film does not explain Bill's reasons to kill the bride, which makes the situation seem far- fetched. On the other hand, the seemingly random way the film shows action scenes, western, or martial arts makes everything with a very forced and unreal appearance. Fans can say that its a satire, a tribute... say what they want. The film is still poor and far- fetched at the expense of those bad choices of the director.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Are their plot holes, yeah I guess so but who has time to notice.Film buffs who are into grindhouse, 70's B-actioners and dodgy martial arts movies will feel right at home here (except for the picture and sound quality lol).

77,Anonymous_Maxine,They must have used up all the fake blood in Volume 1.,10,28 April 2004,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** When you have a movie as hugely popular as Kill Bill Vol. 1, it is to be expected that it's sequel, or in this case it's other half, generates a huge amount of expectation and attention, especially when it also involves a director as hugely (and deservedly) popular as Quentin Tarantino. Combine this with the depth of Tarantino's films and the amount of subject matter that he wisely leaves up to individual interpretation, and you have a virtual blank canvas upon which just about anyone can insert almost any meaning that they want the movie to have. This makes for some pretty interesting film criticism read, on the IMDb and elsewhere, but the reason I bring this up is because I just read an article in the April 26, 2004 issue of Time magazine in which Richard Corliss claims that Kill Bill II has `enough blood to appease the Passion of the Christ crowd.' Is it just me or is this a display of a massive misunderstanding of the Passion of the Christ and it's intended audience?Anyway, back what is arguably the less violent of the two movies under discussion. Kill Bill II is not a sequel and it's not a prequel, but while it is simply the other half one the same story, it has elements of both sequel and prequel. It's part II but it also tells about the story before part I began but it also picks up directly in the middle of a story, in the middle of which Part I also ended. We learn about what exactly was going on at the fateful `wedding party' where the first film began, we learn about the past of The Bride, why Bill tried to kill her, why she was getting married, and why she is so heavily trained in martial arts (hint: it's not just because she's starring in a movie directed by a life-long lover of kung-fu movies).(spoilers) There is a memorable scene where The Bride, whose real name turns out to be Beatrix, is enduring some of her early training from an old kung-fu wizard who, when he stands up and fights, reveals that he is not as old as he looks from far away, but rather about as old as he looks close-up. No that the make-up was bad. In fact, that endless beard managed to earn itself a spot as one of the best sources of comic relief in this movie which, being a Tarantino film, is literally brimming with comic relief.Like Part I, however, Tarantino is very aware of which scenes should have a comedic edge, and which scenes would destroy the movie if they were made amusing. The scene where Beatrix is buried alive, for example, is like the scene in Part I where she realizes that she is no longer pregnant. Neither should be funny, and neither are. In this case, it comes dangerously close, as Budd (one of Beatrix's targets) and one of his Texas hillbilly friends are looking down at the restrained Bride, and said hillbilly, in his miniscule amount of screen time, presents himself as a staggeringly backwards and idiotic inbred moron, such a clod of a man that you almost have to laugh in pity. There really are people like that in the world, it's tragic.Volume II has been called a character study, and I have to agree. The movie is essentially, and importantly, about the vague and blank spots in Volume I. Specifically, the other characters in the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. While it's true that much of the suspense is killed by the little factoid that it's not hard to guess that these former partners of Beatrix are going to meet an unpleasant end at some point in the movie, the ultimate face-off with Bill could not have been less expected. At least one of the characters, Michael Madsen's Budd, believes that Beatrix deserves her revenge, but none of them, himself included, are planning on allowing her to achieve what she deserves.I was initially pretty surprised at how talky Volume II is, mostly because I expected it to be even more violent given the fact that is necessarily includes the climax of the overall story. On the other hand, after a movie like Kill Bill Vol. 1, Quentin really had a lot of explaining to do. The dialogue in the movie is unnervingly thoughtful, much of it, especially in the scene with Bill, even psychological, which is another of Tarantino's signature film tricks. He can make brutally violent characters speak like philosophers and you don't even really realize it until you write a movie review about it later and think to yourself, Hey, who talks like that in real life? Or maybe that's just me. My favorite example is most of the dialogue between Vincent and Jules in Pulp Fiction.The females in Kill Bill are famously much deadlier than the men (Budd, for example, has graduated in life to a dingy trailer in the middle of the Texas desert and earned himself the highly skilled job as a bouncer at a topless bar), which is good, because our hero is a woman and what would be the fun of her just running around and exacting her revenge on a lot of men? Compare Daryl Hannah's Elle Driver to Madsen's Budd (and the way she calmly killed him) and you'll know what I mean.Speaking of which, here's an interesting scene. Elle Driver comes to Budd's house because he's called her to inform her that he has buried alive their highest value target, and he wants to sell her priceless Hattori Hanso sword to Elle for a measly million bucks. Elle shows up, gives Budd the money as he stumbles around the trailer in true redneck form, spilling his drink everywhere (doesn't matter, he's rich now, he won't be living there much longer anyway), and as he sits down and starts greedily pulling out wads of $100 bills, he uncovers a black mamba snake, for which Beatrix was code named.I assume Elle used a black mamba both for symbolism reasons, as well as to punish him appropriately for burying Beatrix alive before she was able to have her way with her first. At any rate it provides an excellent opportunity for Elle to provide the toxicological contents of the black mamba's venom as it seeps into Budd's bloodstream from all of the bite wounds to his face. Animal Planet was never this muc fun! What makes no sense about the scene is that after the snake delivers a series of fatal bites to Budd's face, it disappears and Elle walks calmly around the trailer, even stooping to the floor to gather the pile of now-loose $100 bills back into the suitcase, never once worried that the snake might still be around to deliver another fatal dose a venom. I doubt if black mamba snakes take sides in such a conflict as these people are engaged in. And besides that, how did she get it in there in the first place?Sure, there are some holes here, but I like to think that despite such inconsistencies and loose points like these, the movie doesn't even falter. Indeed, it is surely a testament to both the popularity and skill of Quentin Tarantino that he is able to so smoothly get away with a scene like this, where literally the only thing that makes sense is that the snake would be in a biting mood after being stuffed in a suitcase packed with wads of $100 bills.I've read articles here and there about Quentin talking about putting together a Kill Bill Vol. III sometime in the distant future (after part 1 I had a theory that Vernita Green's daughter would come back in Vol. II to get her revenge against her mother's killer the way O-Ren Ishii did for her parents' killer, but then I realized that she would still be a little girl in Vol. II), as well as an animated prequel in the same style as the animated sequence in Vol.I. Tarantino is, however famous for leaving projects on the back burner for years and years, if not indefinitely, so while a Vol. III would not be released for years anyway, there may be little use in holding your breath waiting for more of the Bill saga to come from the Tarantino camp. I can't believe I just said that. I hate it when people talk about this camp or that camp.Anyway, Kill Bill as a whole is an intricate and self-sustained movie that is not in need of any other movies to supplement it, but it is also clever in that it leaves tons of room for at least one more or two more movies. And given the popularity and quality of the two parts so far, I don't imagine there would be a lot of complaints about more.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
78,southdavid,Crazy Eighty Eight Out Of Ten,8,16 June 2020,"So. On to volume 2. Though lacking the action of volume 1, I came away liking this half of the story more than the previous one. It's more talky, more talky than even I remembered, but it's also more dramatic and it's moments of violence spread out.The second half of the story shifts the focus back to America as The Bride (Uma Thurman) hunts down the remaining members of the VIPER hit squad Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) before heading after Bill (David Carradine) himself. However, after falling into a trap, The Bride has to recall specific training given to her by Pai Mei (Chai-Hui Liu) for just such an occasion.It's definitely the less cooler half of the story. There's no iconic outfits, tunes, no pussy waggons. There's no action to rival the Crazy 88 scene, though the fight between The Bride and Elle Driver in the confined quarters of a mobile home is pretty great stuff. But it's a better story than volume 1. It has an Arc across it as we see the Two Pines Massacre, before what Budd is up to and his interactions with the bride that take us to one of the darkest points of a story that's filled with dark moment.The ending is perhaps slightly underwhelming. The scenes between The Bride and Bill are fun, and the dialogue here is perhaps as close to Tarantino dialogue at its best that the two films ever get too.What it is, is another Q.T. film that, whilst its quality is undeniable, I don't feel is an undisputed classic.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
79,videorama-759-859391,"Volume to this one, lowers a lot",8,12 March 2014,"A slower, less, less, less, less bloodier Bill, which will have a few blood craving fans, sold short like I was. I'm with them. This one lacks the powerful intensity and ferociousness of the first, it's hard to imagine this was connected to Volume One, let alone the same movie. With two down and three to go, our seductress of vengeance Bea.... (sorry, shouldn't of said the name) continues her bloody (gees I love that word) quest n those who wanted her dead. The way the victims die, where pathetic. I was expecting real bloody scenes, and the five finger technique was a joke, yet this is still an enjoyable ride, but just not as good as the first. Carradine is an asset here where we see much more of him like Madsen who plays Bill's younger wilder brother. Hey would we want him any other way. Kill Bill 2 is more a sedate action flick, even the massacre in that church where Bea bought it, the violence there was veiled as we only heard shooting coming out of the church. May'be it was Tarantino's intention to make this part less violent, but still we can't get our head around, that this is adjoined to the first all out bloody outing. With a few dead stops, we have some lengthy scenes too with this one, some philosophical involving Bea being trained by an grumpy old fart of a master, when I think of all those stone steps, I get tired. Too is Carradine's scene near the end, as he lectures little Bea's daughter about death. And the Tarantino humour hasn't gone astray either, the scene with Larry Bishop lecturing Madsen in his office about work ethics was my favourite scene. Michael Parks, incidentally plays another character, not notorious sheriff Pete McGraw, who bought the farm in From Dusk To Dawn. With all the critiques, call them inadequacies, just mentioned, this still comes as good solid entertainment, in a well told tale that only it's master Tarantino can tell.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
80,FiendishDramaturgy,AKA KILL BILL VOL 2...One of the few worthy sequels,9,20 January 2005,"This chapter of the ""Bride's"" story picks up precisely where it left us, at the end of Kill Bill, Vol. 1, and seamlessly carries us forward through the second half of Tarantino's dark and twisted saga.This chapter was not nearly as sanguineous as the first, but was more treacherously deranged (if you can believe it). The execution of this screen play and the filming styles are inspired and simply breathtaking. As the stakes mount in the Bride's game of cat and mouse, the players find they must stop at nothing, in order to survive her rampage of unrelenting revenge. Tarantino took out all the stops and directed one of the most disturbing and dastardly sinister enterprises I've seen. I can't think of a single film which compares to the atmosphere and story, the depth of these characters, and the overall enjoyability of the work that is Kill Bill, Vol. 2.I wholeheartedly recommend this run to anyone who has a love of revenge movies, action flicks, and splatter fans (though splatter fans may prefer Kill Bill, Vol. 1, now that I think about it).It rates the exact same rating as the first at an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
81,jtindahouse,Surpasses The Original!!!,9,30 September 2004,"This movie was a more story telling movie than the original which was basically just an action movie made to entertain from scene 1. While this movie wade to be as exciting as the original it was definitely made to be a better movie which it was. I mean a movie doesn't have to be people cutting each other to pieces to be an exciting movie which is exactly what this movie portrayed. Daryl Hannah (Elle Driver) was very good in her role as was Michael Madsen (Budd). David Carradine (Bill) was alright but didn't really live up to the expectations of The Brilliant ""Bill"". Samuel L. Jackson did a wicked cameo which I think gave the movie a bit of a kick for that chapter. But of course as you would expect if you haven't seen this Uma Thurman is the best actor and does every thing very well. I personally think Quentin Tarantino will be very happy with himself and the two movies.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
82,Turfseer,The Emperor's New Clothes,5,17 June 2009,"Quentin Tarrantino tells us in the documentary which is part of the special features section of the Kill Bill Volume 2 DVD, that Volume 2 is much more an homage to spaghetti westerns than to the martial arts homage of Volume 1. Volume 2 brings us back to the beginning of Volume 1, The Massacre at Two Pines. It's a slow-moving scene where we finally get to meet Bill who ultimately rejects The Bride's deep-seated wish to leave her murderous past behind. Quite fortunately Tarrantino opts not to mimic Peckinpah westerns and show us close-ups of the massacre in slow motion. In fact none of the massacre is shown and by doing so he wisely avoids alienating his audience. Kill Bill Volume 2 ends up being more camp than horror show. Had Tarrantino decided to show the massacre of innocents it wouldn't have worked in his film precisely because the victims (aside from the 'real' people at the wedding rehearsal) are comic book villains who we are not supposed to identify with.Michael Madsen as Bill's brother, Budd, does an excellent job portraying the former assassin turned bouncer. The portrait of the wise-cracking psychopath features some of Tarrantino's best dialogue. But the whole idea that The Bride (aka Beatrix Kiddo), who has just taken down 100 Samurai swordsman in a space of few minutes in Volume 1 would allow herself to be so easily subdued by a blast of ""rock salt"" from Budd's rifle is ludicrous. Obviously Tarrantino needed a way to have her overcome an even more impossible challenge than the 100 plus Samurai swordsman—in this case, she now ends up buried alive in a coffin and in Houdini-like fashion, is able to extricate herself from the situation. The absurdity of the scene reaches its apotheosis when Beatrix utilizes her zen-like martial arts training to punch a hole in the coffin with her bare hand and then miraculously levitate through mounds of earth to freedom above ground.I very much liked how Tarrantino uses Gordon Liu to play different parts in Volume 1 and 2. Liu is the martial arts master Pai Mei in Volume 2 and Beatrix's training at the hands of this gruff instructor prove to be one of the more engaging and streamlined sequences in the film. Tarrantino also uses another actor, Michael Parks, to play two different roles. He's the sheriff in the beginning of Volume 1 and transforms himself into Bill's father figure, an old pimp, Esteban Vihaio, in Volume 2. Parks really shows his mettle as an actor since he is virtually unrecognizable from one part to the next.Things get even better in the ""Elle and I"" sequence. Darryl Hannah is perfect as the demented one-eyed assassin who first kills Budd with a Black Mamba poisonous snake and then gets into a fight to the death with Beatrix. The fight scene was so over the top that it can be considered a classic in terms of campy female vs. female fight sequences. It's a scene that perhaps comes closest to being funny out of all the scenes in both Volumes 1 and 2.Unlike Volume 1 which ends with a bang, Volume 2 ends with a whimper. In a very long-winded and tame confrontation, the late David Carradine (not looking very well at all) finally reveals why he 'overreacted' and went after Beatrix. It was a matter of simple jealousy—he couldn't stand the idea of Beatrix being with another man. So that's it—after one killing after another, the whole reason for Bill's actions rests on irrational jealousy. This is what we've waited for, for the entire movie. Tarrantino doesn't bother explaining who Bill is at all. We find next to nothing about him. He has no history and is merely a flimsy prop, the catalyst to get all the bloody events moving. Bill has no back story and Carradine has no character to mold here.Tarrantino is probably better served directing movies based on adaptations. As a writer of his own material, Tarrantino is the master of not only style over substance but elevating nastiness to high kitsch. Visually he'll be remembered for some classic scenes but often many of these scenes are too drawn out and need to be edited. Most disappointing is the revelation of the ultimate motivation of the antagonist—in its utter simplicity Tarrantino is revealed to be the Emperor with no clothes, an 'auteur' who puts a premium on 'shock cinema' at the expense of intellect.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
83,Captain_Couth,Second part of as three plus hour movie.,3,5 March 2005,"Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004) was the second half of a three hour plus movie that was directed by Quentin Tarantino (the action scenes were directed by Yuen Woo-Ping). Since nobody wanted to watch a nearly four hour grind house movie, the producers decided to split the movie in half and put all the left over footage in part two. In doing so the movie feels very bloated and the film tends to drag in many places.The Bride is nearing the end of her long road to vengeance. With only the last two members of the DiVas hit squad left to dispatch (Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen) complications arise during the trip. She still has certain feelings for her former mentor. Can she push them aside and finish her mission?Extremely disappointing second half of the Kill Bill saga. Instead of continuing the total comic book carnage of the first film, Quentin Tarantino caved into pressure from the critics and made a pseudo chick flick masquerading as an action/revenge film. Whatever momentum he built whilst making the first film died on the vine in this pretentious film. Too bad because part one was actually quite good. But when this tripe hit the streets (it took forever with Q.T. constantly tinkering with the finished product) it just sat their and stunk. Highly disappointing.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

She goes to kill (Madsen) with the help of a sword? How naive! At least he's not like O-Ren and her crazy 88 who don't believe in guns! How a respectable professional killer like (Madsen) became that miserable poor person? The script didn't bother itself making him an addict or something!, or why he offered the option to (The Bride) between eye spray or battery, since he would bury her both ways?, and really how could he live this have-not life while he already owns a legendary sword that equals millions???!!! The answer might be: it's emotionally valuable to him, but I think the more right answer is: this is written by the same man who directed it, so no one got to ask questions like that in the middle!""The monk, the fish, and Superman!""It has some of the most stupid dialogues ever written for a movie. The thing to provoke is when you suddenly find the movie wear the wisdom's sackcloth, speaking in sick elaborately about things that seem out of the whole thing or too silly like the kind of the snake that killed (Madsen) and in full details, the monk that began a massacre in the year of 1003, and the memorable lecture about (Superman) which is so judicious and also inserted when it relates itself to the story. Even the good tale of the fish and the kid, who has the killer's seed inside of her, was done so tastelessly. Actually these stuffs beg to be spoofed.

He seems a 100 year old, so how did he manage to be a father for this child?! Moreover, I think his age was the reason why there wasn't any fair fight at the end, which reminds me; this movie sufferers from one bad rhythmic disorder whereas there is a big battle at the end of its first half, then nothing like it later. As an action movie, it didn't deliver here, so forget about any thrill, and when you watch a long movie, in 2 volumes, about a hot revenge story on a guy named (Bill), to get at its end that (Bill), and to kill him as simple as that; then this is disappointing for the movie-goers that (Tarantino) supposedly knows best!""What was that?!""Maybe (Tarantino) used the most popular theme in all the world's B-movies: the revenge, to pay a homage, ANOTHER homage, to the cinemas that he loves, through the characters of the killers: the blaxploitation (Vivica A. Fox), the far Eastern action cinema (Lucy Liu), the western (Michael Madsen), and perhaps the European violent movies (Daryl Hannah). It would've been kind of attractive if he really made it this way. As with easy pretending writing, the story was mere yet stark flat, and all the characters, so their events, seemed hanging in the air (read: Tarantino's poor hallucination). He built the nonsense world in a nonsensical way as well, concentrating mainly on certain sequences or nostalgic details (for him!), more than the big picture, degrading the personality of his movie, and achieving a heavy emptiness!As an album for B movies, this volume isn't creative but lazy and sleazy. And as a whole, it lacks originality in a way that made some say how (Tarantino) is a copycat! For me, it's one of the worst as alleged more than done. So, it ended up as not a good B movie or a good homage.It mirrors BADLY how he's a conceited moviemaker, making a long boring idiot trivial movie (the rest of the attributes is in my review about Vol. 1), believing that it's the opposite. You can sense his vainglory as well as delusion through touches like: mentioning at the closing credits that the character of (The Bride) is written by Q & U; meaning (Quentin Tarantino) and (Uma Thurman)!!, his description of (The Bride)'s massacre as ""legendary""!, plus some irritating publicity like (The Fourth Movie By Quentin Tarantino!!) while no one ever used that with more honored, better, directors.(Tarantino) already killed his own movie, creating something not good on artistic or entertaining levels, delivering us a complete waste of time, which works only as a nasty caprice for its maker.""Someday, they'll see the light!""Although it's not a groundbreaking, it's a breakdown, but you'll have countless dull ones who'll tell you: ""Yes, it's bad, but being bad was the point""!!!!!!!, so it's good in being bad????? If you love it as it is; fine, nobody can control their heart, but arguing in this way is the dumbest, most manipulative, ever which turns any bad into great!

87,dfranzen70,Eh.,6,20 April 2004,"My first thought is that this isn't nearly as good as the first one. But that's a little unfair, since the first one was (for me) an amazing film.Making a two-volume movie is a huge gamble. If the first one tanks, then no one's going to want to see the second one, which has likely already been filmed. If the first one is a rousing success, though, then it becomes the standard by which the second one is judged. For the filmmaker, this can be a losing proposition.The movie follows the revenge game played by The Bride (Uma Thurman), on her quest to find the man who ordered her wedding party slaughtered. Oh, and the man whose baby she was carrying when he put a bullet in her brain. Only the bullet didn't kill The Bride - it merely put her in a long coma. And when she woke up - look out!In the first film, The Bride tracked down two of her former compadres in killing as part of an elite hit squad. Now she has three names left on her list: Budd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and her ex-boss and ex-lover, Bill (David Carradine).Quentin Tarantino takes an approach similar to the one he used to such great success in Pulp Fiction and that he reused in the first Kill Bill movie - scenes (chapters, in this case) that are shown to the audience out of order. Luckily, the scenes aren't so jumbled that the audience can't follow what's going on. In fact, the order rearranging is fairly tame by Tarantino standards.Tarantino does a great job in incorporating various movie genres into his film; it's part samurai thriller, part kung fu actioner, part cheesy, kitschy, zap-powie seventies schlock. He's always been proficient in this area; Pulp Fiction's characters at times seemed to be stuck in the seventies, but at the same time they didn't appear to be fish out of water. That's the genius of Tarantino.Where this film diverges from the first, however, is in its pacing. Volume 1 was chock full of fast-paced action scenes - The Bride taking on the Crazy 88 springs to mind - but while there are a few interesting, riveting scenes in Vol. 2, there aren't nearly enough of them. And because there are insufficient action scenes, there are plenty of times when the movie seems to flag a little. A lull in a Tarantino movie can be richly cultivated (remember the ""awkward silences"" scene with Thurman and John Travolta in Pulp Fiction), but if there's nothing going on either above or below the surface, then the audience will get a little bored. Especially if they've been expecting wall-to-wall gore.The performances are rather remarkable, however. Thurman continues to amaze as The Bride (a character she and Tarantino came up with together). Quick - how many action movies can you name that had a strong female lead? Ok, now how many of those were any good? Thurman would have to be incredible in order to carry this film, and she doesn't disappoint in the least. Whereas she was a pleasant surprise in Vol. 1, we now expect her to do the same in Vol. 2, and she's up to the task.Equally up to the task is 67-year-old David Carradine. Yep, 67. I didn't realize he was such an old goat! And one look at him... well, let's just say Mr. Carradine has lived a hard life. Leathery and craggy, he's a Mount Rushmore of actors - and I don't mean in terms of professional stature. Carradine's quickly approaching his dad's prolific career (John Carradine appeared in around 500 movies). But he's found the role of a lifetime as Bill, and he commands every scene he's in. That velvety-smooth, world-weary voice disguises a malevolent scheming that lets you know he will persevere in the end. But does he? Doesn't the title belie that answer?Michael Madsen is just okay in his role as Bill's brother Budd, but that's not an insult. He's just Michael Madsen, turning in a performance one expects from Michael Madsen (who could forget him as Mr. Blonde in Reservoir Dogs?).Another of Tarantino's more admirable traits is that he's able to get compelling performances of a lifetime from his actors. Take Daryl Hannah. Could anyone really have predicted she would even be IN this movie? The mermaid from Splash? But as Elle Driver, Hannah's cold, sexy.... and blind in one eye. (How she lost that one eye is explained, rather vividly.)Tarantino also loves to bring back moldy-oldie actors from Back in the Day, partly to revive their careers and partly as an homage to those older films he grew up with. This time around, he has Gordon Liu, who plays the mystical Pai Mei, who trained Bill's elite squad. We see some amazing scenes of The Bride being trained hard by Pai Mei, scenes that are of course reminiscent of all of the wise-master-training-young-hotshot kung-fu films (such as Jackie Chan's Drunken Master). We also see Bo Svenson as the reverend who's about to marry The Bride, and Michael Parks as old Bill friend Esteban Vihaio. Oh, and Sid Haig, whom I last saw in House of 1,000 Corpses, is barkeep at the nudie bar at which Budd's a bouncer.Aside from the sometimes-turgid pacing, another problem is the soundtrack. There were several times throughout the movie when the music was substantially louder than the dialogue on the screen! Now, I ask you - does that make any sense? Tarantino's always been a stickler for having the right song for the right scene, but come on - if I can't hear his strong dialogue, what's the point?I guess this film, in essence, didn't grab me as the first one did. I didn't leave the theater satisfied. I didn't leave with some of my favorite scenes still being played in my mind, over and over again. For me, the movie was flat and fell below expectations. It's still a well-done movie, but it's not up to Vol. 1's excellence.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
88,dee.reid,Conclusion,10,10 August 2004,"With the two-volume series of films that come to be known as ""Kill Bill,"" Quentin Tarantino has achieved a level of creativity lacking in most modern films that will take years to surpass.  ""Kill Bill"" is, in fact, an amalgam of all the grindhouse cinema outings that Tarantino made during the 70s.When you think real hard about it, the plot to ""Kill Bill"" is absolutely ludicrous, and under the direction of a normal filmmaker, wouldn't make it past the 50-minute mark.  But under Tarantino's careful guidance, that ludicrous plot remains ludicrous, but he injects his requited love of cinema into the material and the plot suddenly takes a life and a whole new spin.""Kill Bill"" is by far Tarantino's most accomplished work as a director, considering that I typically favor his non-directorial efforts (""True Romance,"" ""Natural Born Killers,"" ""From Dusk Till Dawn"") over his own directorial outings (""Reservoir Dogs,"" ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Jackie Brown"").I certainly look forward to more from Quentin Tarantino in the future being that with ""Kill Bill,"" he has created a cinematic epic of one man's love of movies and then seeing it realized on the screen.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
89,meeza,Cool Bill to Play!,8,6 September 2004,"Pump up the volume! Pump up the volume! Pump up the volume! Kill Bill!That is what masterful director Quentin Tarantino does in the exhilarating ""Kill Bill Volume 2"". Various questions are answered in this version so there is no doubt that you will get your kicks out of Volume 2. Uma Thurman returns as ""The Bride"", the vengeful martial arts master who continues her quest to, you got it, kill Bill. Those of you who experienced Volume 1, know that she had her ""Bill of Rights"" to do that after what Sir William did to her in the dress wedding rehearsal. Along her vengeful voyage, she still possesses the need to liquidate some of Bill's associates: Budd (a.k.a. Swidewinder) & Elle Driver (a.k.a. California Mountain Snake). Tarantino budd, I mean bud, Michael Madsen was cool as a Bud Light with his performance. Daryl Hannah as the California Mountain Snake was venomous with her sly work also. Both are deserving of Supporting Actor noms. However, let's kick it up a notch; the sharpest supporting work of ""Volume 2"" was beheaded by no other than the ""King Fu"" himself David Carradine as Bill. Let's not forget about our temperamental bride: Uma Thurman should get her comeuppance by being nominated for a Best Actress Oscar after being snubbed for Volume 1. Memo to the Academy: You do not want to p*ss her off! Just ask Bill! Volume 2 does have its arduous lapses but it is incorporated for the sake of the story. Tarantino's ingenious dialogue is what still drives his films, and it is no different here in ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"". So get up and go biller blading by viewing ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"". **** Good",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
90,drqshadow-reviews,"The Bride's Follow-Up Changes Gears, But Remains Intense and Riveting",8,16 April 2012,"A much slower, more suspensefully contemplative take on the same material as its first chapter. Rather than being on a non-stop offensive, this time we see the Bride in a more reactive role as her kills don't always go so swimmingly. Along the way, we catch a glimpse at her training in a stereotypically isolated Japanese temple, alongside an impishly charismatic bearded master, the show-stealing Pai Mei. When it comes time for the inevitable showdown with Bill himself, Tarantino plays his trump card and leaves a driven audience (and vengeful bride) confused about the apparent simplicity of their quest of the last four-plus hours. It's not as instantly captivating as the first package, and a few segments fall curiously flat, but it's enjoyable in surprising new ways and provides the closure we were all so desperate for. It's a perfectly appropriate finale, if not the one I may have been expecting.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
91,st-shot,Second verse same as the first but worse.,2,26 January 2011,"King of high cinema kitsch Quentin Tarantino's second installment of things I stole from Sergio Leone and Bruce Lee and tarted up with a big budget is amazingly even worse than his first act of cannibalism. There's the same torpid pace, solemn goof ball rhetoric and the endless close-ups of bug eyed Uma Thurman looking determined all painted in three coats of red. And if the last one wasn't slow enough there's an extra twenty minutes on this one to put you into an even deeper sleep. It's Slower Pussycat, Bore, Bore.Ah, yes the plot. Somewhere in a parallel universe Clint Eastwood sex change Beatrix Kiddo takes up where she left off in her last hell bent crusade to exact revenge upon the indelicate crowd that made a mess of her wedding day. Facing some of the same cartoon characters from the first installment bridezilla runs into more than a share of rough patches (yes me lads an ladies Elle Driver is back) but it is more than clear from the twinkle in Kiddo's bulbous orb it's gonna take a lot more than a blast to the chest from a shot gun filled with rock salt and being buried alive to neutralize this righteous dudessa. Bill 2 is filled with Tarantino's typical smug sadism (it's all his characters seem to live for) and poor taste in music score lifting. There's the grindingly slow pace, the inept self indulgent use of film grammar (lotsa commas and capital letters) and as always the sentimental wallowing in vapid low budget nostalgia. It's the type of garbage that was third on the bill at the drive in back in the 70s when you were trying to get as much face time in with your date before you had to take her home ( ""Of course it's late, it was a triple feature.""). The only difference is that hipster auteur Tarantino has enough cash to spray paint it with a high gloss metallic lacquer that in this day and age gets gobbled up by a moronic generation raised on computer game violence with a reference point that stretches back as far as 1990. Can't wait for the third installment.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
92,alindsay-al,a fantastic second half that improves on the first,9,26 November 2014,"I really did like kill bill vol 1, however, I did think it lacked something possibly due to the fact it is a film that mainly sets up the sequel. This film once again sees the bride return of the bride on her killing spree to get to her final showdown with her old master bill. I think the first kill bill was a return to form for uma Thurman and it continued with this film with the character of the bride being expanded on and her performance being more well rounded. The supporting cast is also really good with David carrehane being fantastic as bill and his performance was necessarily great because it made the revenge hunt more interesting. The other characters are great with budd and the one eyed assassin being great characters and adding overall to the plot. As I said in my faster movie review I really like revenge stories and this one was almost flawless with the emphasis on the revenge theme really working but I do think some of the flash backs were too long and also the ending is really anticlimactic. The script is Tarantino genius and it really helps this film's story be driven along nicely. The style is also not as over the top as the first film and all the action is great with the fight scenes being very crisp. I advise you watch the two kill bill films back to back it will make the experience a lot better for this fantastic film.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
93,Chris_Docker,Classic Tarantino,9,5 May 2004,"Tarantino movies are almost a genre in themselves. Stylised violence, trendy sequences, all delivered with great panache and storylines that are original enough to be noticed. Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction set a high standard to follow, even though they were acclaimed by audiences more than serious critics. Dusk till Dawn was something of a flop as vampire and gangster stories failed to gel, whilst the understated Jackie Brown seemed little more than an aberration from established Tarantino style. With Kill Bill and Kill Bill II, Tarantino is back on form with a vengeance. Part One demonstrated extreme and polished action scenes into which much thought had gone - for instance a martial arts stand off that contrasts genre wirework fighting some of the most realistic fighting on film since Bruce Lee; the overall effect was a surfeit of stunning action where viewers would probably have been content with the simplest of explanatory codas to justify the visual experience. Kill Bill II, on the other hand, rather than just filling in these holes, presents us with some fantastic characterisation and an underlying plot for Parts I and II that is as gut wrenching as it is believable. As we follow elite killer Uma Thurman in her quest to hunt down and kill Bill we are given insight into her physical prowess (learnt at the hand of a legendary and unique teacher), and dragged through the emotional turmoil that has sparked off the whole raison d'etre. Complex relationships between the members of the elite group of killers spiral into an insoluble dilemma for the two main players: one that can only be resolved by taking a heartbreaking decision. Kill Bill is a major triumph for director Quinten Tarantino and worth every minute.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
94,MaxBorg89,An outstanding conclusion!,10,11 January 2006,"Much of Kill Bill's success depended on how the story would end. It couldn't be too predictable, but not too bizarre either. Luckily, Tarantino came up with one of the most brilliant epilogues in film history. In fact, Kill Bill: Vol.2 could be his absolute masterpiece, alongside Pulp Fiction. It really is that good.Following the events of Vol.1, The Bride (Uma Thurman) has three more people to kill: Budd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and, finally, the Man, Bill (David Carradine)! But since there are only three left, what are we gonna see during the rest of the film, the Crazy 88 having already been wiped out in the previous movie? That's what Tarantino aficionados are gonna love: the talky, ironic, totally quotable bits are back (the highlight? Bill revealing the ""truth"" about Superman's mythology, just like QT did with Like a Virgin in Reservoir Dogs). Some of the dialogue is reminiscent of Sergio Leone, and that's no coincidence: 75% of the movie is Tarantino's own version of the Spaghetti Western, with Ennio Morricone's music, a homage to the last scene of The Searchers (with Thurman replacing John Wayne) and the fact that most of the story takes place in Texas (we finally get to see the so-called Texas Wedding Chapel Massacre, which includes an intelligent cameo by Samuel L. Jackson). Okay, but what about the remaining 25%? That part (the middle section of the film) shows us how The Bride learned all the various killing techniques she masters, as we witness her brutal training with Pai Mei (Gordon Liu, who was Johnny Mo in Vol.1). It looks ugly, but it's one of the most interesting mentor/pupil relationships I've ever seen. If Tarantino had made Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, the Pai Mei chapter of Kill Bill: Vol.2 is probably what it would have looked like.So, now the time has come to talk about what everyone expects to be the unmissable part of this film: the climactic Uma/Bill showdown. Well, without spoiling anything, it's a powerful, emotionally loaded confrontation, a tragic love story, the most touching ending Tarantino has ever filmed. And much of those scenes'beauty lies in the leading couple: Thurman is arguably even better than in Vol.1 (kind of a weird statement, given the two volumes were shot together and meant to be one single film), and Carradine's comeback was worth waiting for, similarly to John Travolta's return to form in Pulp Fiction. The only thing I don't understand is why the Academy ignored two excellent performances such as those we had the luck to see in this movie.I don't think another director would have been able to achieve something this good. Kill Bill belongs to Quentin Tarantino, who has once again proved he can pick up an overused concept and turn it into a remarkable picture.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
95,noralee,Magnificent Tribute to the Movies,10,19 December 2005,"""Kill Bill, Volume 2"" confirmed for me that I will never, in my entire life, ever be able to see as many movies as Quentin Tarantino has already seen.While ""Kill Bill, Volume 1"" convinced me that I would not in fact want to see the zillions of samurai, chop-sockey, anime, etc. genre films that he had seen and was joyously reenacting in every chapter, ""Volume 2,"" a.k.a. the second half of really one movie, is an extensive tribute to movies which I have seen, from John Ford and Sergio Leone Westerns to Billy Wilder comedies and noirs and on and on. In a recent interview with Charlie Rose, the voluble Tarantino made his case as a film historian by claiming that Uma Thurman is his visual muse like Josef von Sternberg's inspiration was Marlene Dietrich, but that was just one calculated explanation for the older demographic who watches PBS as their violent collaboration may make Scorcese/DeNiro comparisons more apt.In ""Volume 2"" the other movie references are astounding and breathtaking -- every note of music (the extensive actual samples and the connectors by Robert Rodriguez), every setting, prop and article of clothing on screen, camera angle, actor cast, through all the nostalgic credits, let alone every clip any character is watching on their TV, is a loving tribute to another film (we will have to wait for the super deluxe collector's edition DVD that combines Volumes 1 and 2 to communicate the footnotes with multiple eggs).Yet it manages not to be a pastiche or a parody, but a masterful, post-modern work of art culminating in a passionate expression of love of movies as the ultimate bed time story (as accompanied by one of my favorite songs, Shivaree's creepy take on ""Good Night Moon""), even if it cannot stand on its own to be enjoyed by the kind of person who only sees a couple of movies a decade. Tarantino may be a motormouth but he is in complete control of all these references, cutting them up like a collage and lovingly transforming them within his vision.To the disappointment of the kid in the back row who didn't shut up, ""Volume 2"" has far less sock 'em violent set pieces, cartoonish or otherwise, than the earlier chapter, and far more very funny humor and marvelous dialog, especially as delivered by an iconic David Carradine (others will connect him to this film via the TV series ""Kung Fu,"" but I first loved him in the TV version of ""Shane,"" which is also recalled here). From the planes of his craggy visage, to Uma's gleaming eyes and lips, to the cinematography of Robert Richardson, this is also a strikingly beautiful film.It is certainly not necessary to have seen ""Volume 1"" to appreciate the second part, but that adds to the power of the unexpectedly cathartic change that The Bride undergoes on her quest, redolent of ""The Wizard of Oz.""Tarantino emotionally yet ironically makes the case that violent movies are fantasies that don't turn people into killers, rather they can bring families together. And now I do want to catch up on samurai movies!(originally written 4/30/2004)",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
96,davispittman,"Good sequel, not as good as #1 though",8,1 March 2018,"I personally really enjoyed Kill Bill: Vol. 1. It was full of well written dialogue, featured good performances, and was very entertaining. All of the same things are true for this sequel, although it's not quite as good as the first movie. The cast is a lot of the same, Thurman, Carradine, Hannah, and Madsen are all back and all turn in great performances. Thurman's character is now focusing on the three remaining people that are left on her quest for revenge. I want to focus on these three individuals separately. First, is Michael Madsen. He plays his character very well, he is not very fanatic, he's pretty laid back and chill most of the time, and in a way that makes his character more menacing, because of the ease that comes with his actions. He was a great choice for his role. But ya know who was the absolute perfect choice for their role? Daryl Hannah. Hannah plays Elle, the one eyed ruthless assassin. I adored her performance, she really gave it her all. I was transfixed by her acting ability here, especially since it's a pretty unusual role for her. And of course Thurman was just amazing in the lead, just as she was in Vol. 1. I do suggest this sequel, but only if this is your kind of movie and only if you liked the first film. Well written dialogue, fine performances, and a lot of great action. 8/10.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

The Performances are Strong, especially by Thurman and Carradine. The Film has more characters and dialogue driven than Vol.1.

Original had a lot of action and many different styles, this movie pretty much is in one shape and it's pretty slow. Many moments just feel so out of place. I don't buy it that Bride was shot by Budd. In comparision that she did in original it feels as is she's got 10x weaker and stupidier. Also I can't understand the last arc of this film that she gets to the Bill and just stays in the house like nothing.

99,slokes,The Better Half,8,24 September 2004,"It's a matter of some debate which volume of Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill"" is better. Let's end the argument right now: David Carradine doesn't even appear in ""Volume 1."" Hasn't the Academy mailed him his Best Supporting Actor Oscar already?In the first volume of ""Kill Bill,"" released only a few months before ""Vol. 2"" in the tail end of 2003, we met Uma Thurman, one peeded-off super-assassin taking out some folks from her past one at a time, with the occasional mega-posse thrown in for interest. ""Vol. 1"" had a lot of blood, violence, and wisecracks, and galloped across the screen like a rap video on steroids.""Vol. 2"" is way different. It makes sense it's a separate movie; the tone is such a departure from ""Vol. 1"" in two ways. One is style. Director Tarantino has fun stylistically quoting Sergio Leone and chop-fu cheapos from the late 1960s and early 1970s. Cinematic sampling is something he's good at and enjoys, but in ""Vol. 2"" he doesn't go as overboard as he does in ""Vol. 1."" He pulls back and lets the plot breathe, rather than filling every spare second with a homage-cum-parody that maybe a dozen lucky fans will get. Maybe some here wish he'd pile it on a bit more, but they have to make do with the goofy Pei Mai sequence, which is a flashback and hence not jarring in its ""Vol. 1""-style comic-book treatment. Throughout ""Vol. 2"" the emphasis is on storytelling and character-building, which is where it should be given we are now being asked to deepen our commitment of interest to these people. ""Vol. 1"" is okay for what it is, but its flash and action are no match for the depth and nuance of ""Vol. 2.""This gets to the second different tonal difference between the films, which is emotional. It all comes back to the characters. They don't quite become real people here, but they get close enough to get under your skin. Admittedly, the opening part of ""Vol. 2"" tests the viewer's patience a bit, there's some long bits that show the director hasn't really mastered self-discipline, like with Thurman's graveyard struggle, but the meandering usually has a purpose. Tarantino is building toward something here that has its payoff when Thurman's character finally has her face-to-face showdown with Carradine's Bill.From that moment forward to the end, this is the best Tarantino has ever been.Carradine and Thurman dominate the proceedings with two of the finest performances I've seen, certainly the best Tarantino has directed, playing off the mythology we've been taught in ""Vol. 1"" and developing resonances with the viewer both together and apart which will surprise those expecting a casual butt-kicking affair. We finally find out what Carradine means in the first line of ""Vol. 1"" where he tells a whimpering victim he is being masochistic, not sadistic, and its a powerful revelation, that this sinister baddie may have a heart buried under that cold exterior. Carradine is perfect in his phrasing, his pauses, the tired glint in his eye, or the way he says ""Kiddo."" You can't ask for a better veteran performance. For her part, Thurman presents a brilliantly conflicted character who can not stop either hating or loving Bill, and brings us not into a world of cartoon anguish, but real human pain.""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is slow-moving, and needs ""Vol. 1"" in a way few sequels do, since it assumes you know nearly all the characters coming in. That's a weakness. So are some undeniably pointless bits, including the entire sequence with Bill's father figure, Esteban Vihaio, and some business at a bar involving Michael Madsen, who plays a former assassin now gone to seed.Madsen's good, though, and so's Daryl Hannah as another rather mouthy assassin, Gordon Liu as Pei Mei, and especially Perla Haney-Jardine as a girl named B.B. The nice thing with Tarantino is for every scene that strikes a bum note, there's four or five that hit the right mark, and some manage to do much more. My favorite scene involves a Mexican standoff in an L.A. hotel room between Thurman's character and an anonymous hitwoman, at once grippingly suspenseful, hilarious, and life-affirming. Still, it's the final moments of this film that will stay with you, as Bill and his former pupil work out their ""unfinished business"" and we are left to ponder the results of their decisions and actions.""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" may not reach the heights of cinema to which it aspires, the level of ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly"" quoted in its score, but it's a fine film that will make most viewers glad they stuck around for the second installment.

It's about ex assassin Beatrix Kiddo going to kill the last two assassins, Budd (Madsen) and Elle Driver (Hannah) and then kill Bill. The reasons that I enjoyed this over the last is that this movie puts action and style second to good writing and character development, yet it still has great style. Where the first was a Japanese action movie, most of this is like a Spagetti Western. The first film was more like a hard core action flick, where this one had some time to breathe in between, and was more like ""Jackie Brown"" in it's quietness but still very entertaining. Some other positives are Gordon Lui who played a different tole in Kill Bill 1. He plays her teacher Pei Mei in a long flashback. Michael Parks is also very good as Bill's 80 year old pimp father figure.My rating: 10/10 stars. 138 mins. rated R for violence, language and drug use.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Although the pacing does take a drag as the film starts out, Kill Bill Vol. 2 doesn't waste any more time than it needs to telling its story in the best way possible, and is for the majority of its longer runtime, a very entertaining film. As before, the fight sequences are very impressive, and the tone has seemed to find its balance between the harsh and the cool. Uma Thurman shines again as her character the Bride, and David Carradine also gives a very notable performance as Bill himself. In the end, Tarantino provides yet another masterwork of filmmaking by providing a very impressive conclusion to a rather impressive series. The plot may take a bit to get started, and the film may feel a bit unsatisfying for its ending, but all together, it is able to improve on its previous flaws and shine greater than ever before.

102,Jonny_Numb,Killing us softly with his song,8,15 June 2008,"SPOILERS (only for those who have not seen Vol. 1) At the time of its theatrical release, ""Kill Bill, Vol. 2"" was something I probably wouldn't have bothered to see (due to my own dim appraisal of the previous installment), if it hadn't been for two friends who persuaded me otherwise on a lazy Sunday afternoon. I was actually impressed with how much I liked the concluding part, and now that I've viewed both films twice, Vol. 2 feels that much stronger.To recap: The Bride (a convincingly bad-ass Uma Thurman), the sole survivor of a wedding-chapel massacre carried out by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (led by David Carradine's Bill), awakens from a four-year coma to find her unborn child gone (assumed miscarried), and vows vengeance on those responsible for the massacre (should I mention that The Bride was formerly Bill's top assassin?). She has successfully slain Vernita Green aka ""Copperhead"" (Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii aka ""Cottonmouth"" (Lucy Liu)along with dozens of henchmenby the time we meet up with her in Vol. 2.What I still find most admirable about this closing installment is (again) how Tarantino subverts audience expectations. Vol. 1 met its peak in a complicated, visually spellbinding scene where The Bride takes on The Crazy 88s (a gang consisting of dozens of black-masked assassins) in a multi-level Japanese restaurant. One would expect the denouement of Vol. 2 to consist of many scenes as potent and intense, right? Well, that ""literary quality"" I praised in my review of Vol. 1 comes on even stronger in the last half, allowing dialog and backstory to fill in plot-gaps and further develop the trio of central baddiesBudd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and Bill (David Carradine)who were little more than ciphers before.Tarantino develops an intimacy among this quartet, consisting of double-crosses, broken bonds, and revealed secrets that strengthens the story as a whole. And it surprised me how Tarantino's development sheds the skin of homage and irony that punctuated Vol. 1, venturing into territory that carries a genuine emotional impact without downplaying the cost of human life. Death's sting is very much felt here, and you may be blind-sided at how moving it is. And the film's most understated gagthat Bill is really just a jilted lover acting out of extreme jealousycarries an unexpected honesty that enriches the layers of his character.Don't get the wrong ideathere is still a formidable amount of impressive action on display, including a brutal flashback wherein The Bride is trained under the ""cruel tutelage"" of a martial-arts existentialist by the name of Pai Mei, and an incredible sequence where The Bride and Elle have a showdown inside the narrow walls of a trailerbut Tarantino seems more interested in tying all the threads of plot up into a satisfying package, at which he is pretty damn successful. The long-mooted ""showdown"" between The Bride and Bill is drawn-out and surprising, though the final result (baldly announced in the film's title) carries an effect contrary to what most will expect.Both movies combined, ""Kill Bill"" is a superior entertainmentquite possibly the best cinematic offering Tarantino has given us to date.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
103,Steffi_P,"""Beyond your years""",10,7 May 2012,"The exploitation movie – that branch of cheap and violent movies that includes Spaghetti Westerns, Kung Fu, zombie horrors and many other subgenres – has rarely run to epics. These were bottom-line products, made at low cost for (supposedly) unsophisticated audiences, and usually clocked in around the 80 minutes mark. Grand, overarching themes were rarely explored, and the main goal for the filmmakers was generally a high body count and maybe a bit of sex. With Kill Bill however Quentin Tarantino creates a grand, sweeping homage, the exploitation movie to end all exploitation movies, a two-part meditation on the very nature of revenge and killing.As with its predecessor, Volume 2 is a patchwork of references to Tarantino's favourite pictures. This time round he is, if anything, even more flagrant in his referentialism. The flashback at the start of the picture features some rhythmic cross-cutting between close-ups like one of Sergio Leone's early features (notable exceptions as exploitation epics). Then there's a Kung Fu segment which mimics not only the clichés of Hong Kong cinema but also the style of humour and overused zoom lens. Is it theft? Not really. It's channelling the influences in the way one might reshape Romeo and Juliet or La Dame aux Camelias into some other work.Tarantino doesn't just borrow the motifs and camera-work of his cinematic forebears, he also encourages the eerie, taciturn acting that characterised Leone's pictures. Uma Thurman's range broadens even more here. It's amazing the way she is able to portray Kiddo as a tough fighter while still retaining her sensitivity. David Carradine is at his best here in the title role, a model of seductive evil, credible as both the killer and the kind lover and father.And really these two dual-natured performances characterise something that is fundamental to Kill Bill. It's a movie about killing, and one that does not shy away from the sensationalist violence of the exploitation flick, but it is also a movie with a lot of heart and humanity. With volume 2 it becomes clear why volume 1 began with the business over Vernita Green's daughter. It becomes clear why Bill cancelled the hospital hit on Beatrix at the last minute. This is a movie about love as much as hate. Kill Bill is an emotionally mature and intelligent work, while still having that delightful playfulness and comic book mythology. A sincere and worthy tribute to a tawdry yet beloved part of cinematic history.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
104,ShootingShark,"Terrific, Moody, Slow-Burning Spaghetti Western Conclusion To Kill Bill Saga",7,18 June 2005,"The Kill Bill saga concludes as The Bride continues her rampage of revenge, targeting the three remaining members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad - El Paso cowboy Budd, one-eyed swordswoman Elle Driver and the enigmatic Bill himself.Kill Bill Volume 2 is a great follow-up to the first movie, but also a different kind of film with a very different pace and mood. Where its precursor is fast, frenetic and action-packed, this movie is much more mellow and contemplative and its relatively few kung-fu scenes are short and snappy. What I enjoyed most is that we finally get to see the great Carradine strut his stuff as Bill, the baddest hombre in the west. Despite the change of pace, Tarantino is as inventive as ever with his film grammar, using filters galore, old-style telephoto zooms, a great blackout scene (when The Bride is buried alive) lots of wild overhead shots and all his usual wacky music cues - there is a particularly beautiful shot which uses an Ennio Morricone cue from The Good, The Bad And The Ugly to introduce Carradine (playing his flute from the TV show Kung Fu). The performances are all terrific again - Thurman manages to keep her performance dead straight amongst a gallery of nutcases, Madsen and Hannah shine and Liu and Parks are both great playing different characters to the ones they play in the first movie. Tarantino has succeeded in making a tremendous double-barrelled kung-fu classic.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

The fantastic choices made for the first film would have been difficult to recreate, so I can understand why it was a more understated film, but that is why it's just not quite so good. The fight scene with Lucy Liu's bodyguards was brilliant in that film, but wouldn't have fitted in to this second part in the same way. That's the only thing it's really lacking I think.It was an interesting ending, which I had forgotten and I like the fact it wasn't dragged out. The whole thing moved with pace and kept you interested as did the first. I did have to look away during the Texas Burial scene, because it freaked me out and it's a shame that Michael Madsen has started to look like the PE teacher from Glee, I'd always thought he was sexy before, but I thought Daryl Hannah was superb and I loved the Martial Arts training section with Pai Mei.Tarantino's second best film!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
106,a_chinn,Ultimate finale to the ultimate revenge film.,10,8 April 2017,"According to Uma Thurman, Tarantino had her watch three movies to prepare for this film: John Woo's ""The Killer,"" Pam Grier in ""Coffy,"" and Sergio Leone's ""A Fistful of Dollars."" If that sounds awesome to you, then the Kill Bill films are for you! Part two of what was originally planned as a 4-hour plus epic tale of revenge is even better than the first part. If Vol. 1 was primarily a homage to Asian genre cinema of the 60s and 70s, this installment is more a homage to westerns, particularly spaghetti westerns. Nods to others are certainly present (blaxploitation, rednecksploitation, muscle car movies, etc.), but this is primarily a western, which is wonderfully set up by Michael Madsen's down-on-his-luck international assassin character, Buck. Madsen's character could have simply been another sadistic Mr. Blond sociopath, but Buck has a tragic element to him. He was part of an elite group of international assassins, but he's now living in a trailer in the middle of the desert, working as a bouncer at a run down strip club, and even had to hock his Hattori Hanzo sword. Tarantino manages to give Buck a fair amount of character depth with minimal screen time, which is always a great thing to see. Though I think the action highlight of the film has to be the showdown between Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah as the deadly one-eyed Elle Driver. Hannah had largely been absent from any films of note for quite some time, unless you count the Grumpy Old Men films ten years earlier and has sadly been absent from much since then, but she is terrific as Driver. I think a lot of credit also has to go to fight choreographer Yuen Woo Ping for the amazing fight between Thurman and Hannah in buds trailer. Tarantino also gets a lot of credit for selecting some truly bad-ass Ennio Morricone music for their final moments. Tarantino includes in his cast some other cool character actors including Gordon Liu (as a white bearded kung-fu master this time), Sid Haig, and Larry Bishop. And then there is David Carradine as Bill, who finally show his face on screen this time, and who is excellent. I can't imagine anyone else playing this role, even though there were some very cool other actors under consideration to play Bill before Carradine was cast. As with most Tarantino films, this is not a film to suit all tastes, but for those who enjoy Tarantino's aesthetic, this film is a real treat.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

108,triple8,You know a movie's good when it gets better each time you watch it....,10,24 October 2004,"There are certain movies that are just so amazing you almost can't review them because what can you say that hasn't already been said? Such is the case with Kill Bill. In fact my review of Pulp Fiction was quite short as well. Terrentino's movies are so brilliant in their making that even if you don't like them you gotta be awed at the not so simple task of making these movies. And in the case of this one, there isn't one performance that isn't Oscar worthy. And I think it deserves it's place in the IMDb top 250 even more then Pulp Fiction.Kill Bill is a movie I enjoyed throughly and part two is more my thing then one because I am simply more into talky dialog driven movies then movies with less talk and more violence but since 1 and 2 are part of the same film basically spread out over time, I Don't suppose it matters. Nothing brilliant to add-it's all been said. BUT A FEW SPOILERS NOW: My favorite scenes may have been where the bride trains with Pai Mei and the non verbal as well as verbal interaction between them. I sorta wish all performers in this could win Oscars. Just one interesting note to those who may not have seen this.The best films are actually stories that come to life in such a vivid way that they cease to become movies and become a true to life story unfolding in front of you. Kill Bill could be a walking advertisement for such a film. Call it twisted, odd, call it talky, call it violent and unnecessarily brutal(And part two IS violent have no doubt about it). It is all the things mentioned. But it is also an intense movie where the characters are so real you feel like you can reach out and touch them. The direction is perfect and you are with the bride on her heartbreaking journey every step of the way. There isn't one scene in the movie that could have been done any better.The movie is upsetting, to be sure, and will haunt you for days afterward. But the most interesting thing is how hooked you will become without knowing you are hooked. For anything about the movie someone may not enjoy, (if indeed there are any), If you decide to walk out, there will probably come a point when you just won't able to. Great script. Q & U did good!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
109,davidmvining,A completely emotionally satisfying work,10,25 November 2019,"Much like The Lord of the Rings and Manon des Sources, Kill Bill was a large movie shot at one time and released in separate parts.It is amazing that over the course of a single movie, Tarantino turned himself into one of the premier action directors of his generation. The most action-oriented scene he had ever shot before this was probably Mr. White hitting Mr. Pink to the floor in Reservoir Dogs. Then, he brings us Showdown at House of Blue Leaves which is one of the most inventive action tour de forces in modern movie making. One thing Tarantino is, certainly, is a student of film, and it is obvious that he did his homework before he conceived of, planned, executed, and edited together that masterpiece of action cinema.The movie around it is great too.This is Tarantino's epic. This is his most sprawling film with a depth of emotion he rarely ever reaches for. The core of the film is The Bride, Uma Thurman's ex-assassin left for dead by her former boss and lover out for bloody vengeance. She's believably tough, angry, scared, and vulnerable at different times. When she cuts through the Crazy 88 at the House of Blue Leaves, we're not only willing to believe that she can do it (complete with stylistic flourishes like wire-fu that enhances the action into some kind of super-reality), but we're also invested in her journey. The key to that investment is, like with most Tarantino films, the film's structure.The first half of the film is frontloaded with the outer veneer of the conflict that really touches on the most basic of emotions driving The Bride. She was a member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, and when she decided to leave, their leader (and her lover), Bill, took it badly and had her killed. She doesn't quite die, wakes up four years later from a coma to find the baby she had yet to deliver gone, and her legs atrophied to nothing. She wills herself back to functional and begins her quest for revenge. We see her second target to start the film, Vernita Green, who functions as a small and darkly comic introduction to the nature of the conflict. The biggest first fight is the first chronologically, O-ren Ishii.We get O-ren's backstory, which functions not only to tell us the particulars of the young woman's meteoric rise to power within the Japanese underworld, but also as a proxy for the other members of the Squad. We hear very little backstory of the rest of the gang, but we hear O-ren's background in great detail (complete with a full animated sequence). I think that's to give us enough detail to understand O-ren and to also understand that the other members of the squad have similar backgrounds and are similarly deadly, by implication.We then get that fantastic action sequence. One of the few things I understand about building an extended action sequence is that you can't get boring by doing the same thing repeatedly. You have to have variations, complications, and a story within it. That's exactly what the Showdown delivers. We have different characters that feel distinct (especially the young madwoman, Gogo). We have a progression and escalation of the conflict, and we finally get to a full resolution as The Bride lords over her victims, demanding their lost body parts as her property. It's such a virtuoso demonstration of ability at the service of story. I even love the turn to black and white (which was done for the American version to receive an R-rating, it was released in color around the rest of the world). It gains a certain old-school feel that meshes well with the music choices over the visuals, though I imagine that if Tarantino had known he was going to have to release it like that, he might have made different film stock and lighting choices.The second part begins in much the same way as the first, with a prologue that essentially tells the audience that The Bride is going to survive until late in the coming action. With Tarantino, it's not about the destination, it's about the journey, and he's there to make the journey as entertaining as possible.The Bride, fresh from taking out O-ren and Vernita, heads to the American southwest and Budd, Bill's brother and number three on her list. The portrait of Budd that Tarantino draws is so wonderful. He was like the other members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, but he's fallen very far. He's hawked a priceless sword and works as a bouncer in a far from busy strip club, receiving nothing but disdain from his boss and doing the dirtiest jobs in the place. But, he has lost none of his ruthlessness, as The Bride discovers when she shows up at his trailer and tries to take him by surprise.I love the Showdown at House of Blue Leaves, but I think Budd burying The Bride alive might be the best sensationalistic scene of the film. It's claustrophobic (enhanced by Tarantino beginning the sequence in 1.33:1 instead of the 2.35:1 aspect ratio he had used through the whole film), tense, and Budd demonstrates an easy willingness to cause severe pain on The Bride. Budd's final words of the sequence (""This is for breaking my brother's heart."") is so pitch perfect, and then we have one long shot, mostly in complete darkness, as the heavy and jarring sound of dirt crashing against the wooden casket The Bride has been nailed into shoots through the soundtrack.Tarantino then jumps backwards in time to one of the earliest events in the film's chronology, The Bride's training with Pai-Mei, the ancient Chinese kung fu master. It's a highly entertaining sequence that shows The Bride's transition from girlish waif to hardened killer, and it's placed right here in order to provide the most emotionally satisfying conclusion to the burial. Watching The Bride get buried, we have no hope, but learning that part of her training could help (and obviously does help) her escape her prison is emotionally satisfying. Placing that training sequence far earlier would put it 3 hours before the burial, and I think it would have diminished the impact of the sequence's emotional delivery.Anyway, the fights of the film continue to get smaller. Budd gets killed by Elle, the final member of the squad and The Bride's replacement (both Elle and The Bride are blonde with blue eyes, and Elle has obviously become Bill's lover). The Bride, still covered in dirt from her escape, shows up at Budd's trailer and the two have a fight in the dirty confines of Budd's living space. Spittoons are thrown. TV antennae are used as makeshift swords. Walls are torn apart. An eye gets pulled from its socket and stepped on. The Bride makes off, ready to make her final confrontation with Bill.When she does arrive, she finds that her daughter is still alive and the movie's plot stops. The story doesn't stop, it keeps on headfirst, but the plot of killing Bill comes to a complete halt for about half an hour, and it's a great half an hour. Bill, obviously remorseful for what he had done to The Bride, has raised their daughter, B.B., as well as he could, and she's a cute little four-year-old. The Bride gets to know her daughter and puts her to bed before Bill and The Bride have their first scene together since the wedding (rehearsal) massacre. It's a raw scene of condemnation and hatred. It's such a great scene that reveals the depths of the hatred and love the two shared for each other.And once again, the fight gets smaller. I've read that the beach fight that Bill proposes was actually Tarantino's plan, and if he had filmed it, I'm sure it would have looked fantastic. However, I find something really satisfying about the final fight lasting roughly five seconds and done entirely while sitting in chairs across a table. It's intimate and about the characters, not the flashy choreography. Everything ""fun"" about the genre has been stripped away by the time The Bride gets to Bill's hacienda. It probably shouldn't come back at that point.I love this film completely. It's probably Tarantino's most satisfying work emotionally. It has a breadth and depth that is kind of shocking. He became an excellent action director. His dialogue is as fun as ever. He pushed himself to become more, forcing himself to take on tasks that he had never done before, and he excelled at them. This is a triumph for Tarantino.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

111,rosscinema,Second part is more dialogue driven but still quite impressive,8,30 April 2004,"**SPOILERS**This second part of Tarantino's film ties up all the loose ends that were left after the first part ended last year and both parts are very different. Both have fight scenes and flavorful dialogue but in the first part the emphasis was on action while this is more dialogue driven. Part two has The Bride (Uma Thurman) now identified by name as Beatrix Kiddo killing the last two assassins from the Deadly Vipers Squad and then heading to kill Bill (David Carradine). Budd (Michael Madsen) is Bill's brother and he manages to shoot Kiddo with rock salt and then tranquilizes her so that he can bury her alive in a coffin. He calls Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and wants one million dollars for her and they agree but Kiddo manages to escape and goes to seek revenge.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Elle arrives and gives Budd his money but she has tricked him with a black mamba which kills him but then Kiddo bursts in and she and Elle are involved in a brutal fight. Kiddo wins and now she is off to find Bill and kill him but in one of the flashback sequences we see Bill bringing her to Master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu) who spends the next year or so learning martial arts. Kiddo finds Bill and before she kills him she discovers that he has the daughter that she was pregnant with! Kiddo finally meets her daughter B.B. (Perla Haney-Jardine) but later she and Bill have their ultimate showdown.Quentin Tarantino opens this film in black and white but it does eventually move on to color and like the first part their is an abundance of music clips from both television shows like ""Ironside"" and films. This part has a noticable Italian Western tone to it and Ennio Morricone's score from ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly"" is played during a key scene. While the first part had at least 4 big fight scenes in it this part really has one and it's a wonderful spectacle between Thurman and Hannah. Otherwise this has just a sprinkling of action elements like Thurman being buried by Madsen and the training by Liu. Who would have guessed that the best fight scene in a movie this year would be between two women? Both Hannah and Thurman should be given as much praise as possible for their achievement and both of these talented actresses show they can play any role given to them. I can't wait until both parts are available on one special edition DVD and it will be interesting to view both parts in one day. Also in this cast is Samuel L. Jackson as Rufus the organ player and an unrecognizable Bo Svenson as the Reverend. Perennial ""B"" movie actor Sid Haig pops up as a bartender as well. Tarantino has masterfully created a story that is a loving homage to the martial arts films that he so dearly idolizes and this film is dazzling both in it's choreographed action and in the way it's photographed by cinematographer Robert Richardson. Both Thurman and Carradine give unflinching performances and what aids them is Tarantino's wonderful trademark dialogue that not only adds flavor to the action but gives their character's their soul.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
112,Rob_Taylor,"Kill Bill? Should be Kill Tarantino, more like...",1,30 April 2004,"Awful, boring, slow and tedious are just a few words that spring to mind when I recall having to sit through Kill Bill Vol 2. And those are the kindest words I can think of. A few more choice words would be crap, s***e, rubbish or just plain retarded.Now, I admit, I wasn't expecting KB Vol 1 rehashed, but I did expect something not too dissimilar from Vol 2. KB2 is to KB1 as The Sound of Music is to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The first film's non-stop action has been replaced almost entirely by non-stop dialogue. And not particular good dialogue either. In fact, I'll coin a new term here - dire-logue. The film is littered with it. Any film requires a certain amount of exposition, and even mystic claptrap like that in the Matrix movies. But KB Vol 2 takes claptrap to a new level that makes the Matrix movies look positively Spartan in terms of jibber-jabber. But the worst thing about the chatter in KB2 is the total and utter meaninglessness of most of it. It just drones on and on. A character makes a point verbally then, instead of getting on with the movie, the character is forced to belabour the point over and over until you're practically screaming at them to shut the Hell up and get on with it!Nor do the pointlessly long (and in fact, just pointless) extra scenes add to the film in any way. For example, we learn that Bud (Bill's brother) lives in a trailer and has a crappy job at a local bar as a bouncer. He's become a loser - a far cry from his assassin days. What I've just summarized in two sentences is dragged out on film over the course of perhaps twenty minutes or more, including an entirely tedious and unnecessary set of scenes involving Bud at work that add absolutely nothing whatsoever to the film and introduce characters that have no bearing on the movie at all. Another scene involves the Bride talking to one of Bill's old colleagues in order to find out where Bill is located. This scene drags on terribly and gives the viewer pointless information on this character which again has precisely no bearing on the movie at all. The only scene which is worthy of inclusion is the obligatory training scene. This is a direct homage to many old Kung Fu movies, right down to the beard stroking sensei. But even this goes on unnecessarily and has you shifting uncomfortably in your seat. And although this scene ties in with the finale and burial scenes, it only serves to remind you that, whilst the Bride was seemingly unable to master punching her fist through a piece of wood, she was apparently highly enough thought of by Pai Mei (the sensei) that he taught her the ""hand of death"" trick which he had previously never taught to anyone. Hmmm.The action sequences are brief and entirely unsatisfying for a movie based around the concept of revenge. Bud isn't even slain by the Bride, but by Elle using a Black Mamba (we know it's a Black Mamba because, as Bud is writhing in his death throes on the floor, Elle gives us a tedious five minute exposition on the snake). Elle isn't killed by the Bride, but rather maimed and left after a fight that was very scrappy and not at all elegant. And finally Bill, who is killed by the Bride (after endless boring dialogue about superheroes) in one of the most anticlimactic and disappointing ""final encounter"" scenes I've ever witnessed.The truth of this movie is that it's really not a movie at all. It's the extra half-hour that they had to cut from the first film, padded out to two hours or so to make a sequel. With not even particularly brutal editing, KB2 could be distilled down into 30 minutes of relevant, interesting scenes and tacked on to KB1 to make that movie complete. Otherwise this bloated monstrosity is doomed to obscurity in the way that so many sequels so often are - due to over hype and audience expectations being too high.Quentin Tarantino is to be commended for his movie efforts on the most part. However, KB2 is little more than self-indulgent twaddle wrapped up as a film and served up for consumption on the strength of its predecessor. It's destined to become one of those ""I liked so-and-so, but the sequel was rubbish"" type of deals. This is even more certain in the light of certain comments I read by Tarantino where he made a big deal of telling everyone that he was sparing no effort in the editing room. If this film is an example of his editing skills, I'd say he needs to be evicted from post-production facilities and the door locked securely behind him to ensure he can't get back in.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
113,Sandcooler,"The pictures, they come to life",10,3 March 2010,"While relying on and ""lending"" from his vast collection of samurai movies, Tarantino may just have made the ultimate revenge flick. It's almost five hours long, but it still feels as if it flashes by. The fight scenes in this movie are downright unbelievable, great choreography and exillerating cartoon gore. The omnipresent music just tops them of, some brilliant musical choices there. Tarantino's touch is unmistakable, especially the Pai Mei sequences have his name written all over them. The Five Pointed Palm Exploding Heart Technique, the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, he sure had his fun with this project. Some people didn't like the final showdown, and it wasn't what I had expected either, but it's still a great conclusion. To me it was the perfect way to end the story, a climax rather than an anti-climax. ""Kill Bill"" is a wonderous journey through the samurai genre.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
114,Matt_Layden,Death List Five....Complete,8,14 February 2005,"Finally got to see Vol 2, the conclusion to a long journey that the Bride was taken.First of all let me just say that if you are going into this film to see the violence that Vol 1 had, you'll be disappointed big time, this movie is heavy on the dialogue, that being sad, that would have to be one of the weak points in the film, too many scenes where Bill and The Bride are just talking. Don't get me wrong, I loved the Tarantino Dialogue, I was laughing 50% of the time through the movie, based on the brilliant dialogue that Tarantino puts in everyone of his films. David (Bill) was awesome, he was perfect for the role, he IS BILL, no one else can play bill, he has the perfect voice, the perfect look, and the perfect humour for it, I loved every minute he was on the screen. Another character I loved every time he was on the screen....Pai-Mei (sp). He was great, awesome comic relief for an intense film, which leads me to my second disappointing part. NOT ENOUGH PAI-MEI, and what a sh*tty way to die, this guy is the mother f*cking guy to kick your ass with his finger, this guy will f*ck you up, and he dies from food poison?? That was really lame for me, although the small amount of screen time he did have, was great.This leads me into my third disappointment, the way Budd dies. Again at the hands of Elle (same as Pai-Mei) and she doesn't actually kill either of them (Budd=snake, Pia-Mei=poison) Come on b*tch, Budd was a great character and kicked some ass too, he has balls to bury her alive and we get to see no fight between the two? Which leads me into my final disappointment of the film, talking about fighting...no final battle between The Bride a.k.a Black Mamba a.k.a Mommy a.k.a Beatrix Kiddo. and Bill? As soon as he told her at the camp fire scene about the heart explosion, I knew that is how Bill would die and I wanted yo see some blood, but he just falls down, that all disappointed me. BUT!!! The movie is so good, that all that disappointment doesn't take the film down that much.This movie felt more like a Tarantino movie than the first Vol did, and that's a good sign. The fight scene between The Bride and Elle was great, didn't expect the eye pluck part, then to top it off, she STEPS ON THE EYE (laughed me ass off when the question mark came up on her name in the credits). I felt bored at one scene, the talking of the fish dying, other than that, this film had me cheering for the Bride (and Budd for some reason). So see this flick not to see Vol 1's ""orgy of blood"", to finish the movie, see a great Tarantino flick and see some awesome acting.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Vol. 1 was about style and imagery, Vol. 2 is gritty and brutal. The hateful jealousy of Elle and Bud's cunning familiarity, offer stark counter-points to the indifferent Vernita and O-Ren's detachment. In Volume 1, Beatrix battled those who only hurt her because it was their job. In Volume 2, she confronts those who had a much more personal stake in her tragic past.Despite the considerable changes in tone between the two volumes, the themes remain consistent. I prefer the first volume more, but the second volume is even more important to the overall story arc. There are still great fights, excellent music, and wonderful writing (the Pai-Mei scenes are some of my favorites from any movie, period), but don't expect a direct continuation of Volume 1's style.

117,winner55,Master and student should not reverse roles,1,26 June 2006,"Kill Bill I was a delightful surprise, living up to its hype as Tarantino's comic-tinged homage to Chinese and Japanese action-genre films. I could easily imagine all the old directors from Toei Studios having a blast watching Tarantino's final sword-fight scene, a loving imitation of all their samurai reincarnation or Shogun's Ninja films. Then Tarantino had to go and release this pap and spoil everything.There are two principle problems with this film. First, Tarantino decided he didn't want to do genre any more. KBII is a ""serious"" film, about such weighty topics as guilt and redemption and love and death and all those other philosophical topics Woody Allen used to poke fun at before he decided to become a ""serious"" filmmaker, too.Well, maybe Tarantino could have pulled that off - he didn't do so bad in Pulp Fiction - but he makes what for me is one of those mistakes a film fan can not forgive another film fan for making: he trivializes his predecessors.Although this film has a large chunk at the beginning paying tribute to the old Shaw Bros. studio (which the first film promised but never got around to), the principle references in this reference-laden film are to the films of Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone. And unfortunately, in deciding to make a ""serious"" film, in order to deal with these references, Tarantino decides that Peckinpah and Leone made typical genre films (i.e., not ""serious"" films), and that therefore it was up to a better director (himself) to make a ""serious"" film from their raw materials.Well, here's the news, Quentin. The Wild Bunch is the American version of Homer's Iliad, and all you've managed to come up with is a Hallmark greeting card that doesn't rhyme. Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West is the Cistine Chapel of a modern Michaelangelo, and all you've given us here is a color-by-numbers Norman Rockwell copy.What in the name of heaven could Tarantino have been thinking of by trying to ""out-serious"" directors we know perfectly well he admires?What we get here are cartoon versions of moments from Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia and Once Upon a Time in the West. And that stolen Ennio Morricone music! sure it worked in KBI, because that was homage to Asian genre films and Asian genre films did that sort of thing all the time; but if you're going to get serious, it's time to get original; and, for heaven's sake, Morricone is still alive, I'm sure he'd have been glad to write a new score.Finally, I should mention an obvious influence on this film that Tarantino would probably not want mentioned - the films of the Coen Brothers. Although they started earlier than Tarantino, they are still technically of the same generation as he. I'm not talking plagiarism - the Coens have done their share of ""homaging"" with and without credit to the originals. But Tarantino can't afford to try to ""out-serious' filmmakers still making films. Especially since the Coens know how to do an homage with respect.What Tarantino ends up with here is a bunch of scenes that keep banging into each other like box-cars on a (slowly) derailing train. Better it wasn't made. Skip it.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
118,brando647,It's Time for the Bride to Kill Bill...,9,26 December 2007,"The Bride reaches the conclusion to her quest for revenge! After the first volume followed the Bride's confrontations with the first two targets (Vernita Green and O-Ren Ishii), the second volume shows her hunt for the remaining two DiVAS members, as well as Bill himself. We really struck me as odd about volume two was that it was a COMPLETELY different style than its predecessor. Where volume one was a bloody kung-fu exploitation film, volume two tones it down and delves more into the story. It goes into greater detail about what led up to the attack on the Bride, as well as where she received her training that turned her into one of the most dangerous women in the world.This volume has considerably less violence and less bloodshed. The fights are still spectacular with some of the greatest choreography I've seen in modern movies. The fights are brutal and still pack a serious punch. The battle between the Bride and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) is basically an all-out brawl with elements of martial arts giving it some grace. As I said before, we are given more story in this volume so we get more information around the legend of the Bride. My favorite scene in the whole movie has to be the chapter dealing with her training under Pai Mei (Gordon Liu); I really just loved the character. As a result of increased storytelling, the movie does move at a slightly slower pace than the first volume but it never fully stalls.Michael Madsen rocks in this movie, but then again I like him in pretty much every role I've seen him in. My favorite addition to this volume was Bill himself. David Carradine almost made me sympathetic for the character when he explains the rationale behind his actions. Unfortunately, the ending was a bit anti-climactic compared to what I went into the movie expecting. For an entire 4 hour saga revolving around the hunt for Bill, I expected something more explosive. It was still a satisfying conclusion to Tarantino's epic tale of revenge and helped make the 'Kill Bill' saga one of Tarantino's best pieces of work.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
119,Lady_Targaryen,The bride is back for the final cut,7,1 April 2006,"''Kill Bill: Vol. 2'' is the second movie about the story of revenge of The Bride, and now we all know her true name: Beatrix Kiddo. I prefer much more the vol.1 then this one, since I loved all the action it had, but without this one, Beatrix's saga would never be complete.We discover that Beatrix Daughter, B.B. is alive and living with Bill, we see Beatrix training with Pai Mei and how Elle lost her eye. Budd, Bill's brother, is murdered by Elle as well. And Elle deservedly lose her only eye left, since Beatrix was mad that she(Elle) killed her(Beatrix) master. The end is surprising,showing that Beatrix learned the five point palm technique with Pai Mei, but she could have fought more with Bill,since it was the fight everybody was expecting the most.A interesting fact that sadly never happened in the movie: The chapter ""Yuki's Revenge"" was cut from filming to accommodate a new chapter, ""Massacre at Two Pines"" that details the attack on The Bride. An outline of the chapter was to have Yukie Yubari,Gogo's sister seek vengeance on the Bride for killing her sister.aka ""Kill Bill-volume 2"" - Brazil",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
120,valadas,Sentimental violence,7,12 May 2004,"Well first you must take for granted that The Bride (Uma Thurman) is a superwoman that can survive injuries that would kill the strongest mortal in this earth. This second part has a much less poetic atmosphere than the first one and less ballet-like fighting scenes and dwells more upon the psychological displays of the characters which culminate in the final scenes where sentiment and emotion prevail over violence though the latter is always present more or less intensely. In this movie you'll find the full explanation of what looked like a flaw of the first movie: the motive behind the killing of all the people at the wedding rehearsal and a quite plausible one. Well these killers may have sentiments too, who knows? Negative or positive of course. Anyway the love-hate relationship that exists between the two main characters is depicted with real strength and a certain contained emotion well displayed by Thurman and Carradine, emotion that explodes in the very last scene played by Thurman. It's a good movie of its kind (of course) after all.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Volume 2 takes you back through the characters and fills in the background to the story and the rivalry between the them.Equally as good as the first (an opinion not shared by everyone) this film is closer to Tarantino's usual style where the story and dialogue carry the film more than the action and the violence. There are still ample thrills and some good fights, but i have to say its the revelations in the plot and the ending that do it for me. Very clever and subtle, and really very funny (in a strange way) this was the perfect end to Tarantino's latest masterpiece.10/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
122,sme_no_densetsu,Here Comes the Bride (Again),8,2 February 2020,"Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"" followed less than a year after the first 'volume'. It concludes the story of the Bride's quest for revenge against her former allies in the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. As you may or may not know, ""Kill Bill"" was originally meant to be a single film but the distributor (Miramax) pushed for it to be split into two. Although they were probably more concerned about maximizing box office receipts, splitting the movie into two probably made it more palatable for most viewers as well. Whatever the motivation, I think that splitting the movie in half was ultimately for the best.There isn't really a lot to say about the story since it just picks up where the first movie left off and puts us back on the road to fulfilling the promise inherent in the title. If you liked the first movie, this is more of the same (which isn't a bad thing). However, it must be said that this chapter is less action-oriented than the first one. There are both positive & negative aspects to that. On one hand, the violence is less cartoonish but, on the other hand, the pace can drag a bit at times. In an ideal world, the two movies would have been condensed just enough to strike the right balance between action & drama.The cast is trimmed down a little from the first movie but we get to see much more from David Carradine (Bill), Darryl Hannah (Elle Driver) & Michael Madsen (Budd) this time around. All contribute good performances and it was also interesting to see Michael Parks & Gordon Liu return in different roles.As with the first movie, the production values are top notch. Tarantino's direction & Robert Richardson's cinematography once again combined to produce a beautiful looking movie. Robert Rodriguez's music might not have produced as many iconic moments as The RZA's musical selections from the first volume but it's still a good soundtrack that gives the movie a unique flavour that sets it apart from the first one.Overall, ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"" does a good job of bringing the Bride's story to a close. It may lack some of the excitement of the first installment but its measured storytelling is just as much a showcase of Tarantino's skill as a screenwriter and a director. Fans of the first movie will no doubt want to follow the story to its conclusion and I see no reason to dissuade them from doing so.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
123,rivertam26,Not on par with vol.1 but still awesome,9,12 July 2020,"It's hard to follow up a perfect flick like vol.1. Really no matter what you do its gonna be a tough disappointing and it was too me at least. That being said they are two completely different films. Where the first one was a bad ass martial arts spectacular. This one is more story driven, comedic and western. Wi th h that said it's still a great movie. Picking up after the events of the first we witness the battles between the bride and elle as well as Budd and finally Bill. There are some surprising twists along the way as well as some insanely fun sequences. But for all the build up it ends up feeling a touch lackluster especially after the events of the first. I can definitely see what he was going for and I feel th ed film us mostly successful it just needed a touch more punch.Budget: $30M

124,Cosmoeticadotcom,So-so,6,25 September 2008,"Despite what many have said about KB2 being better it's not. It's an OK film that narratively stands on its own, but shows the utter superfluity of KB1, which could have had its backstory sliced to a 6 or 7 minute prologue. KB2 opens with the Bride ready to take on Bill's own baby brother- the 3rd member of the Assassins, Budd (Michael Madsen). After stalking him to his trailer home he blows her away with a buckshot of salt. Why he does not kill her with regular bullets is a silly question since this is comic book logic. Additionally, he offers to turn over the Bride's body to Bill's last assassin for $1 million. She's another blonde killer femme, Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), who is missing an eye & wears a patch. Cue classic 1930s serial film villain stupidity: Budd buries the Bride alive. He even gives her a flashlight in her nailed coffin. Flashback: to her training under misogynistic Chinese Kung Fu master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu). This is needless digression because the stereotyped character- similar to KB1's involving the Bride's training with master swordmaker Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba)- adds nothing to the tale that could not have been added in a few casual throwaway references in the script.Length is also a big problem. The 2 films run 226 minutes, or just a quarter hour shy of 4 hours. They were originally to be a single entity but, having had so few films from Tarantino over the years his company wanted to double the bang for the buck. Thus the mishmash editing. Individual scenes are expertly paced and woven, but there are just reams of scenes that do not advance the essential shark-like plot. This is not just taste speaking- too many scenes with trivial but wannabe colorful characters grind the film to a snail's pace. Trim the 90 minutes of KB1 down to 20 or 30 minutes of action, trim the 136 minutes of the plodding KB2 in half & you would've had a very good 90-100 minute film with all the excellent action and revelatory scenes intact. The KB films are a triumph of box office greed and marketing over potentially good art (-cum-self-indulgent pointlessness). Another thing gained by making the films one would be that the teaser at the end of KB1, where we find out Beatrix has a daughter, could be cut and that revelation unfold to both character and audience when she actually confronts Bill. Not that the emotion would have overwhelmed, but knowing this fact about Beatrix before she does castrates whatever empathy we might feel for her near the film's climax.That Tarantino did not see these points, or did but gave in to them, seems to support my belief that he has yet to show the maturity of a great director. He seemed to be going in the right direction with Jackie Brown (easily his best & most mature film) but has regressed with the 2 Kill Bills. Of KB2 I'd grade it 65 of 100, & for the duo of films I'd give it a 75. I hope I'm wrong, but he seems destined, and satisfied, to be merely an A director of B films.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
125,Sirus_the_Virus,Even better than the first one.,10,5 September 2009,"Kill Bill Vol. 2 is an even better film than the original. Now that sort of thing is hard to come by. Because the first film was already fantastic enough. Kill Bill vol. 2 is an even better sequel that explains stuff that they didn't explain in Vol. 1. All you know is that in Vol. 1 The Bride(Uma Thurman) was getting married and Bill, her former lover sent the group of assassins that she used to be a part of to kill her. Her former lover Bill put a bullet in her head. Four years later, she comes out of the coma to kill him and the assassins. That was what the original film was about. The sequel goes a little into it though. I think that the film's ending was right, though I would've preferred it another way. I like David Carradine as Bill, and he deserved a nomination. Kill Bill Vol. 2 is probably my favorite film of 2004. The thing about some of Quentin Tarentino's films is that when something really crazy happens that you just laugh. Like, in this film when The Bride is fighting Elle Driver, she rips out her eye. I laughed at that part because it's insane. I loved kill Bill vol. 2 and I give it a huge thumbs up. It's not like you have to see the original to see this film. They tell you pretty much what happens. You can just watch it for the sake of watching it and you'll love it. The Bride gets into so many situations in the film that I could understand and would be afraid of. I loved Kill Bill Vol. 2.Kill Bill Vol. 2: ****/**** The Plot: In the second and final part of the Kill Bill films, The Bride continues her search for Bill, the man who ordered an attack on her in the original. She has already crossed two assassins off of her list. All she has left is Bill's brother Bud, Elle Driver, Bill's recent lover, and Bill himself.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
126,Vomitron_G,The conclusion of a saga that can be described in three words: Pure Cinematic Art,10,24 February 2006,"Don't expect KILL BILL: Vol 2 to be more of the same. Expect more, not the same. A good director knows the rules of movie-making (in particular scriptwriting). An excellent director knows how to bend and play with those rules. That's exactly what Quentin Tarantino does. Everybody knows he likes to mess around with continuity, but I'll vaguely give a more detailed example. At one point Tarantino builds in a set-up (or a clue, if you want) in the story-line. He then ignores this clue for a while only to deliver the pay-off at the exact moment the attentive viewer remembers the set-up. He does that on several occasions.Once again, I will not list all the things that I loved about this KILL BILL: Vol 2 ('cause the list would be almost infinite), but I did promise to point out some possible flaws.First of all (and this is not a flaw coming from the movie) it was a bad choice made by the production company to split this movie into two volumes. But since they did, Tarantino might have considered of dosing the talking and fighting more proportional. Now we have one volume with a lot of action and the second with a lot of plot-development. To me it still was good, but to fans of the first volume (who'd have to wait some time to see the sequel) it might be a bit of a let-down. This is why I recommend to see both volumes (4 hours!) in one take. That way you'll still feel the rush from the first volume during the second. And in its aftermath you'll find the time to catch your breath and get along with the story.Some viewers consider Tarantino a bit of a show-off. In a way like ""Look at all the things I can do"" and ""Can you spot all the references to all the other films?"". Well, concerning the first statement, I'm all pro: Tarantino has talent, and if one has it, I'd like to see it. So, by all means, Mr. Tarantino, show 'em what you got. And so he did. As to the second statement: any real movie-buff loves spotting references. So bring it on. But it doesn't end there. Tarantino is a real comic-book fan and he likes to mention that rather unsubtle in his movies. I for one applaud that (I like comics too), but a lot of viewers find it redundant. But since he can do whatever he wants in his movies, he does it anyway. I just loved the scene were David Carradine does his monologue about Superman. You can clearly tell that Tarantino acted out that whole scene for Carradine, 'cause when you look at Bill, it's like Tarantino's doing all the talking. Very Amusing. So again, this is actually no flaw. It's just part of the Tarantino-legacy.One question remained after viewing the KILL BILL-saga. How in the world did Bill get a hold of the baby. It seemed plausible The Bride not knowing about it since she was in a coma and she fled the hospital before anyone could tell her. But it felt kinda weird that she didn't ask Bill about it and that he didn't talk about it either. But then again there was already enough talking as it was in volume 2.I can't think of anything else being wrong with KILL BILL. Actually, there isn't anything wrong with it. And I dare anyone to find me just one aspect about KILL BILL (from screenplay, acting, style, shooting-techniques to soundtrack) that isn't simply brilliant.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
127,bobsgrock,The sentimental Tarantino.,10,13 May 2008,"After a bloody good time in Vol. 1 watching Uma Thurman slice of body parts left and right, Quentin Tarantino settles down to give us more story and heart as he finishes the tale of the Bride's revenge against all who betrayed her. While the first part was an homage to kung fu and samurai movies, there are more elements of spaghetti westerns here as well as swordplay. Still, the story is so captivating and miraculous that you get swept in and forget about everything else. Here, we have significantly less action, more impeccable dialogue, and we begin to connect with some of the characters, especially the Bride and Bill. It helps to have good actors and Tarantino has an amazing cast. Thurman carried the first film and is just as good here, but David Carradine as Bill really struck me as how passive yet brutal he could be. It really is a fine piece of acting. Here, we see the sentimental Tarantino, one not really popular with some but I love it. Here, Tarantino gives us situations and events that trigger different emotions and we feel for all these characters. This in my mind makes Vol. 2 a better film than Vol. 1, but really it is all one movie. So, be sure to watch this incredible story of betrayal, vengeance, love, hatred, and of course that impeccable dialogue. You'll be glad you did.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
128,lambiepie-2,"Oh yeah, I think Bill needed to be Killed",9,15 September 2006,"This second installment answers my questions from the first and Part 2 is amazing. One of the things I had heard about Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2 is that Quentin Tarrintino HAD to put this is two volumes because it was running too long. This was the time when people were sitting though such epics as ""The Lord of the Rings"". I don't think its about the time, I think its about the content. I would have had no problem whatsoever sitting through this as one whole film.Our poor heroine has endured much to get to Mr. Bill and finally this brings you to the showdown between our heroine, Ms. Kiddo and Mr. Bill. What strikes you funny is that Mr. Bill is quite the calm, soft-speaking, guy. Quite the paradox for the continuing calculated things he does when they meet and she starts putting the final pieces of her life together.Quentin Tarrintino is a bit more straightforward with this part of the film, not relying too much on the pulp fiction aspects of unfolding the film - we already saw that in part 1, but more on the final steps of revenge and getting to the last piece of the puzzle for our heroine to make that happen, Bill. It unfolds more like the traditional Martial Arts films, and ends beautifully as a homage to them.Again, one of Tarrintino's best efforts. If you can so, watch Kill Bill as a complete work, Parts 1 and 2 in one sitting..it's worth it.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
129,Jeremy_Urquhart,"Equally as good as the brilliant Vol. 1, managing to complement it perfectly while also being so different",10,27 January 2020,"There are few certainties in life.
The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.
When someone is born, eventually they die.
A person starts Kill Bill Vol. 1, and immediately needs to watch Vol. 2. With that cliffhanger in Vol. 1- where we find out The Bride's daughter is somehow still alive- how could you resist?I'm not here to talk about which one is best, because in all honesty, I think they're equally good. Is that something of a cop out on my part? I don't think so, because I can rank other classic film stories split into parts with relative ease (Fellowship>Return>Two Towers, and Empire>New Hope>Jedi for a couple of examples). It really is the 100% honest truth that I cannot differentiate these in terms of quality. But with how different they are, you'd think that it would be easy.Vol. 1 focuses on being a martial arts film homage, with tons of crazy action and violence to satisfy actions fans and provide so much incredible, visceral, extravagant entertainment. Vol. 2 is just as entertaining and engaging but for different reasons. There is violence, but it's certainly less frequent. Instead of extended scenes of action, we get a whole lot of extended dialogue exchanges, which if you go through Tarantino's filmography, is honestly what you get the most out of his films, by and large (despite his reputation for being a filmmaker who packs his films with violence, Kill Bill Vol. 1 in my eyes is his only true action film; that and maybe the second half of Death Proof). The dialogue is fantastically written, and even more impressively, likely wouldn't sound as great if this film wasn't so well cast and acted. This is Uma Thurman's greatest performance; as fantastic and cool as she is in the first volume, Vol. 2 is where she really gets to shine as an actress, as she goes through a whole host of emotions and commits entirely to a role that I'm sure a lesser performer would not take as seriously. David Carradine is also amazing here. I haven't seen much else with him in it, but he brings so much to what could otherwise be a very simple character, and for as terrible as Bill acted, and for as occasionally creepy as he can be, he really feels like a real person. You truly buy the chemistry between him and Thurman (despite the- again, slightly creepy- age difference), and he proves to be an oddly tragic villain. You want The Bride to indeed 'kill Bill,' but at the same time, perhaps you don't. Anytime Thurman and Carradine share the screen, time slips away and the film is utterly captivating.Despite having less action, many of the things that were fantastic about the first volume are just as fantastic here. The look of the film is breathtaking, with a greater focus on paying visual homage here to old westerns rather than the martial arts references found in the first volume- although there is an extended flashback dealing with The Bride's martial arts training that reproduces and pays loving homage to similar old martial arts movies brilliantly. All the music here is selected and used just as perfectly as the amazing soundtrack in the first part. And there are sequences here that while not as over-the-top as the climactic fight against The Crazy 88 in the first, prove just as memorable. Scenes like a one-on-one swordfight in such an enclosed space that one participant cannot even unsheathe their sword, and a painfully drawn-out sequence that will have you on edge, even if you don't think yourself usually susceptible to claustrophobia. And then there's the surprisingly hard-hitting emotion of the whole thing. Vol. 2 is where the characters left standing after Vol. 1 start to feel like real people, and the whole concept of revenge becomes something less simple and straightforward; something that is perhaps even critiqued. The movie gives its characters time to breathe and speak, not just fight, and that's when the surprisingly deep character traits and frequently relatable emotional dilemmas begin to make themselves apparent.I could understand Vol. 1 being seen by some as the better film, and honestly I have no ill will against anyone preferring one of the volumes over the other. For me, they'll always remain equal, proving unbelievably satisfying in their own unique ways while also blending together to create a perfect revenge epic that runs for about four blissfully cinematic hours. Vol. 2 has as much artistic merit as the first despite its different approach and focuses, and I believe as long as you're open to the story continuing in a matter you might not be expecting after the kinetic, violent, and relentless Vol. 1, you should come away satisfied.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

132,mentalcritic,An exercise in self-indulgence...,1,17 October 2004,"Had Kill Bill been directed by a more talented action director such as Paul Verhoeven or Tobe Hooper, the project would have been restricted to one film that would have had a maximum running time of three hours. Not that either of these directors would have needed this much. There is nothing in the combined volumes of Kill Bill that a director who understands the need for efficiency couldn't tell in 130 or 150 minutes. Any other director would be constantly asked if this or that scene moves the plot forward.Interestingly, volume two is approximately half an hour longer than its predecessor, but half as much happens during this time. Half of what we see in this volume is irrelevant drivel that could have been left on the cutting room floor. Budd's job and Beatrix's training are the least of the problems. In the end, the final moment with Bill seems like a two-hour buildup to a five-second payoff.Between Tarantino's constant homages to himself, we get more of the Tao Of Tarantino in which one of the characters bore us to sleep with Tarantino's philosophical gems, this time about Superman's perception of humanity. One suggestion I have for Tarantino that could make these films more viewable for those of us who have grown beyond trends is to keep these gems separate, and publish them in a book instead. Then he ought to get an accurate picture of how wise or brilliant people really think he is. Apparently, Quentin doesn't mind paying homage to himself by referencing products that he has ""disowned"", either. Can we say ""hypocrisy"", children?Given that the typical Tarantino formula is basically pornography that replaces sex with violence, Kill Bill part two basically resembles a porn film with no money shot. Tarantino's constant claims to be offering a commentary on violence would hold weight if he showed it in a realistic, believable manner (a la RoboCop or Total Recall) rather than the eliptic, implied manner that typifies Hollywood. For all the statements about how violent films don't make violent children and so forth, I'd love to see Tarantino put his money where his mouth is for once and show the actual consequences of violence.Ah, to be a director who has an audience that will kiss the ground he walks on no matter how boring or indulgent his films are. George Lucas used to have that, so I guess the lesson to take from that fact is to learn to stop abusing this. Then again, given the low common denominator that the films aim for, I suspect that Mr. Tarantino does not hold his audiences in high regard.I gave Kill Bill: Vol. 2 a one out of ten.

I liked Kill Bill:Volume 2 better than Volume 1, mainly due to the attention given the relationship between Carradine and Thurman, which overall makes the ending tragic. David Carradine has always been an underrated talent and although he made a lot of lame B. movies, he was almost always the best thing about them and in the role of Bill, this is his best performance in years. Uma Thurman is also effective, as is the cast and Tarantino abandons his usual smart-ass line readings in favor of a western atmosphere. Also on board is Michael Parks who is always a welcome presence. However what really accounts for KBV2's best qualities are the training montage scenes as well as the final showdown which consists of poignant dialog which turns this into more of a tragic piece rather than a simple revenge saga. Plus it's weird but Carradine and Thurman have an odd chemistry which never lets us doubt for a moment that they indeed love each other. Simply put this a movie that is well worth owning on DVD.

135,Stampsfightclub,muddled and not as quick and intense as Vol1,7,6 July 2008,"In the follow up to the widely successful Volume 1, Uma Thurman reprises her role as the Bride who continues to search for the remaining members of Bill's group.Tarantino (Pulp Fiction) had set the bench mark with the first instalment, a sharp, exciting and devastating film about a woman who loses everything and is out for revenge, and because the first film was practically perfect apart from a few faults, this sequel wasn't really going to challenge the first. Nevertheless it is a gripping and exciting watch.Uma Thurman (Dangerous Liaisons) again excels in her central role as The Bride, with a strong determination on her mind to finally get full revenge for everything Bill has done to her, and in perhaps the best role of her career apart from Pulp Fiction, Thurman really steals the light in both films with a cutting devilish performance that does her character true justice. With a steely attitude and an emotional life troubling her, the Bride is given the depth and attention by Thurman to make the character an icon in the crime genre.As with the first volume, Tarantino directs in a vibrant way, some scenes in black and white, stories told at different times, flashbacks, fantasises to give the film a very unique approach and something which I had never seen before. The first instalment was certainly better directed and with a wider choice of styles including animations but still there are some true iconic scenes, none more so than the coffin scene, the most uncomfortable scene ever created in such a unique way.Despite the excellent direction and acting, the plot really lacks in comparison. The formula behind the first was more basic with fewer strings attached and there was a clear intention to where the film wanted to go. With the follow up, flashbacks and other stories seem more muddled and over the place, but still interesting. There are a few scary scenes, with snakes, coffins and surprises used to conform to the thriller genre.Again, well directed with great acting and characters but it lacks the intensity and consistency that the first one had without even trying.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
136,jon.h.ochiai,True Super Woman,10,27 April 2004,"Quentin Tarantino's ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" completes the 2 volume set that began last fall, and it is simply an amazing accomplishment. The movie is stunning, and is complete onto itself unlike for example, the individual Lord of the Rings movies. One need not have seen Vol. 1 to be enthralled by Vol. 2. Tarantino is a master of context. Vol. 2 even surpasses Vol. 1, largely because this movie is more story driven. Tarantino's screenplay (along with the credited Uma Thurman) breathes life into the characters of The Bride (Uma Thurman), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), especially Bill (wonderfully played by David Caradine), and clarifies the juxtaposed plot thread. The dialog has the signature Tarantino crisp, quirky, whacked sensibility. In Vol. 2 Uma Thurman emerges as a powerful and commanding screen presence, a true movie star, and a gifted actor. Tarantino provided the foundation of ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"", and Thurman gives it it's soul. When last we left off, the unnamed Bride killed off 2 members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. Yes, she had left a trail of blood and body parts in the aftermath. Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle Driver (Hannah) remain on her list before she kills Bill. Turns out that The Bride has a name that was actually revealed in Vol. 1-- left here unsaid. Also from Vol.1 we know that The Bride's child lives, and that Bill was named the father. So The Bride's path for revenge is no longer a straight line. First on her list is Budd, who is Bill's brother. Somehow during their encounter, The Bride ends up buried alive. But this is merely a vehicle for Tarantino's storytelling genius. The Bride recalls her training with Kung Fu master Pai Mei (a truly excellent Gordon Liu). Using humor and amazing kung fu technique, he reveals an axiom of mastery in the martial arts: First, one has to cop to the fact that he or she knows nothing. Secondly, whatever one already knows really means jack. Brilliant.Though Vol. 2 relies more on narrative and dialog, the action and fighting sequences are breathtaking. They are all brutal, though there is a distinct elegance inherent to them. The training sequences with Pai Mei and The Bride are visually stunning. The battle between Elle Driver and The Bride is captivating with a sense of style and humor (Driver is unable to draw her samurai sword, because they are fighting in a low ceiling trailer home). Daryl Hannah is smart, sexy, deadly, and totally hot. She is perfect as Elle. Both she and Thurman trained intensely to do what they did on screen. David Caradine is awesome as Bill. He is slick, cool, and flaunts this arrogant air of enlightenment. He has a classic scene with Tarantino's dialog, regarding his fascination of Super Heroes, particularly with Superman. According to Bill, Superman wakes up in the morning knowing that he is Superman-- his alter ego is Clark Kent who is weak. Bill's point is that The Bride is a natural born killer, and everything else is pretense. This punctuates that The Bride even in her singular mission of vengeance, is a hero. This is an acknowledgment of Uma Thurman's performance. Her Bride is so strong of sheer will and spirit, and at the same time she dismisses some of her humanity because it clouds her focus-- to kill Bill. Thurman is that rare combination of beauty, intelligence, power, grace, and vulnerability. Her performance as The Bride is like the perfect haiku-- it's poetry. ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" is the best movie of the year, thus far. Tarantino is a master storyteller. Uma Thurman has become a powerful and completely captivating movie presence. She should continue to take on commanding movie roles. Vol. 2 is an awesome movie.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

There are good moments, but when this rampage stops roaring, it reveals itself as a bit of a sham.

138,jluis1984,The best part was saved for the end...,9,24 October 2006,"A year after the release of ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"", director Quentin Tarantino's tribute to the 70s, appears the conclusion to the Bride's quest for revenge. While originally meant to be one single film, the studio forced Tarantino to make two films out of it due to the very long runtime the film would have had. Whether this information is true or not, personally I think that the decision to split the film in two was actually beneficial for the plot, as this allowed Tarantino the liberty to take two slightly different approaches (although the overall ""feeling"" is still the same in the two films) to tell one single bloody story of love, hate, and revenge.""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" presents the final part of The Bride's (Uma Thurman) saga, as we follow the former assassin in her way to meet Bill's younger brother, Budd (Michael Madsen), and her nemesis, Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), numbers three and four in her list after killing O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Viviva A. Fox). However, the path to finally find and kill Bill (David Carradine) is filled with troubles and surprises, as the remaining members of The Deadly Viper Assassination squad are now expecting her and ready to make her meet her end. One question remains, will she be strong enough to kill her former boss and ex lover, Bill? Just like the former chapter, ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is an ode to the films that inspired Tarantino to make films, and while the first volume of the saga was focused on 70s films (specially martial arts movies), this volume goes further in the past and showcases Tarantino's taste for noir films (in a very well-done intro that captures that style) and specially for Westerns. As the Bride moves to the West to face Budd and Elle, the Western genre begins to domain the film's style with nods not only to the Spaghetti Westerns of the 60s, but also to John Ford's classic films. Tarantino plays with his influences and pays a respectful homage to them (even manage to include a new nod to martial arts films) without going out of the context of his revenge tale.""Vol. 2"" marks a definitive change in tone from the first, as while ""Vol. 1"" is a visually arresting display of action, ""Vol. 2"" moves in a more personal, introspective environment, closer to the Western films that influenced it. Tarantino's script takes a strength unseen in the first part and the film becomes the character study that was missed in the first. The Bride's quest for revenge becomes more complex than what it seemed at first, and her enemies as well present inner conflicts that show a development from the first film. It's overall a less flashy, but more meaty film that completes the first part in a very fitting way. If ""Vol. 1"" is the visceral passionated side of the story, ""Vol. 2"" is the intellectual (although no less passionated) side of it.Uma Thurman is back as The Bride and here finally she can show that not only she can do lots of stunt, she also can act. Her character's background is really expanded here and so are her chances to shine. Again, it is her character what drives the film, so her performance truly makes the difference between a dull movie and an exciting film. David Carradine finally appears as Bill, presenting a sympathetic side of a character we learned to hate in ""Vol. 1"". Not an easy task for an actor, and surprisingly Carradine makes it work. Personally, I had little faith in his performance but was pleasantly surprised by it. Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah are fantastic in their roles as the Bride's former teammates; Madsen in a low-key performance that shows the underrated talent the man has, and Hannah in a role that shows her great skill for black comedy.Many people bashes both ""Kill Bill"" volumes accusing them of being rip-offs of classic films, but I find such claims a bit naive or biased, as even when Tarantino certainly borrows a lot from those movies, he does it in a respectful way (and also carefully places the elements in his own world) that can only be accused of being a tribute rather than a shameless steal. Personally, I found ""Vol. 2"" to be the best part of the saga, mainly in the way the characters become as important as the visual style, and also in the way it references its influences without the flashy display of the first part. Still, watching the film is rather pointless without having seen ""Vol. 1"", as unlike the first one, this movie can't stand alone on its own (well, it's a direct sequel).While the first ""Kill Bill"" is a triumph of style over substance, ""Vol. 2"" is certainly the substance's revenge. Tarantino concludes the Bride's saga in an almost flawless way that improves the first part and leaves the door open to new interesting projects in the future. Probably the separation in two volumes was for the best, as ""Kill Bill Vol. 2"" is a satisfactory conclusion for a bloody tale of revenge. 9/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
139,stamper,The Tarantino Pentathlon Part 5 - The temporary end of his return: Kill Bill Vol. 2,8,24 April 2004,"The sentimental showdownKill Bill Vol. 2 deserves to be another film than Kill Bill Vol. 1, not only the fact that the film would then run 4 hours + if it had been shown in one piece, but more because showing both films in one run might come across somewhat odd. The reason I'm saying this, is because Kill Bill Vol. 2 is very different in tone and feeling than was Vol. 1. The first part was more anger driven and brutal, whereas Kill Bill Vol. 2 is more about love and disappointment. Where the first part is bloody and ruthless, the second one is tender and sore. This does not mean that there is no brutality in this film, but rather that the tone of the film is totally different.
I must admit that it took me some getting used to in the first 20 or so minutes of the film, because I'd expected the film to go on as brutally and furious as the first one finished. It didn't happen. What I got instead was a more story and character driven film, that was filled with emotion, explanations and some good and original fighting scenes.
I have no negative comments on this film I guess. I think the acting was good to very good, with the extra kudos going to Daryl Hannah, who'd let some people to believe that she as just a tall blond who couldn't act in the last couple of years. With this film she manages to show us though, that she just has not been given the right offers. This I must say seems to be some kind of quality of Tarantino, to get discarded' actors and actresses and give them an opportunity to shine once again. Speaking of Tarantino, although I do realize that with Kill Bill he was an 'hommage' to many of his influences, I just have to say that he is a great director and screenwriter. I mean, the way he directs, the music he chooses to accompany the scenes and the dialog. It's just all top notch. This does not mean that this is the best film I've ever seen, but that it is a good film, which fulfilled it's promises. I mean let us ALL be honest. Who can pull off filming a revenge movie lasting more than 4 hours without it getting dull and boring? NOBODY but Tarantino. Hell, most people can't make complete a good 90 minute flick with this amount of story.
7,5 out of 10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
140,tbills2,Kill Bill: Vol. 2,8,6 April 2014,"Figuring out which Kill Bill is better is pretty tough. The 2nd may be. Quentin Tarantino strikes back with a vengeance in Kill Bill Vol. 2! The 2nd Kill Bill is entirely different from the 1st Kill Bill. Kill Bill 1 is action-filled and stylized at a fast pace. Kill Bill 2 is loaded with lengthy dialogue and suspenseful at a slow pace. Both volumes just so happen to be great. They're only different kinds of movies yet still one single movie. The 1st volume has the more centralized story with a more standard story progression while the 2nd volume has a more drifting story focus with a less standard developing story. Kill Bill: Vol. 1 isn't completely crafted as presentably well as Kill Bill: Vol. 2 but Kill Bill: Vol. 1 has way more substance to its story, while Kill Bill: Vol. 2 has less substance to its entire story but is presentably crafted better than Kill Bill: Vol. 1 but Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is also the more difficult movie to presentably craft completely because it has better material substance. The 1st Kill Bill has overwhelmingly more edited detail to the picture and story. The 2nd Kill Bill has a more complete technical value to the picture. Kill Bill 1 has more action sequences with exciting exaggerated effects. Kill Bill 2's action sequences are more naturally toned down. Kill Bill 1 keeps things generally on the surface. Bill 2 goes into more depth. Kill Bill 1 is better, but Kill Bill 2 is so close that it doesn't even matter, they're both great! I can say that Kill Bill 2 should have used more action dominant plot points and twists and turns; the movie feels to fail at impressing Vol. 1's adrenaline pumping action. Kill Bill: Vol. 2 does though have its fair share of seriously sick substance though! The moment when The Bride is captured and buried alive by Budd through to the moment when The Bride snatches Elle's eye out is all simply delicious cinema enjoyment! The beginning, before about Budd and the wedding chapel is very good, and the end, after about Bill and Beatrix Kiddo and B.B. is very good, but all of that middle, the middle about Budd and The Bride and Master Pai Mei and Elle Driver and the lonely grave of Paula Schultz and the cruel tutelage of Master Pai Mei and The Bride and Elle's sweet samurai sword fight in Budd's small little trailer is Kill Bill Vol. 2 at its most unstoppable best! Uma Thurman is unreal, my God! Daryl Hannah, David Carridine, Michael Madsen, Lucy Liu, and Vivica A. Fox makeup the Deadly Viper Assassin Squad, and they are amazing in it! Kill Bill 2 is sure great, but the way it chooses to steer away and try to expand upon The Bride's revenge on Bill main plot line is done admirably and interestingly and terrifically but pointlessly. It should of just stuck to the whole point of the matter, The Bride's revenge versus Bill, and delivered the goods like the 1st one did with an epic and over the top, action-intense, Quentin Tarantinoesque final showdown ending with Bill vs. The Bride! All that said, Quentin is the man, and I cannot wait for the 3rd Kill Bill because the 1st 2 Kill Bills are really, really awesome!!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
141,fernandoschiavi,"Now with less exaggeration, less reference and a film with a much more paced rhythm, 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' bets on phenomenal dialogues, script and free controlled violence",8,15 May 2020,"With the critical and public success of the first part and many outstanding issues, volume 2 of 'Kill Bill' comes to close all loose ends and surprise us with the mishaps faced by the Bride on her way in search of revenge on her disaffected. After having eliminated two targets in the first half, now it is time to carry out the rematch against the other participants in the Texas chapel massacre.After being betrayed by Bill (David Carradine) and his former group, the murderous Bride (Uma Thurman) is on the verge of death for four years. After waking up from a coma, she goes after each of her former companions to kill them. In the second part of this quest for revenge, the bride will continue her search for Bill, attacking Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), the last two survivors of the group. The confrontation with her former master, and mastermind of her death, will reveal new surprises for the assassin.If the first volume had a lot of graphic violence in a more cartoonish tone and a more accentuated side of humor, in this second part we have a change of tone. As the work was not originally intended to be displayed in two parts, this tone was already purposeful, but with the division it became even clearer. This does not mean that it is a film completely opposite to the previous one. Volume 2 continues to feature violent and elaborate scenes, highlighting the burial with our protagonist and revenge against the last two survivors of the group. The scenes, especially those of the burial, are much more like a horror movie. Uma Thurman's performance in these sequences is spectacular, giving us all the suffering and despair of the character.However, it is clear that in this conclusion, Tarantino prefers to highlight other characteristics of his works. Knowing that this final part would have to explain issues just mentioned above and that, especially the confrontation with Bill, would have to bring an emotional and dramatic charge to the audience, he inserts much more text in the characters' mouths, with the right to analogies to superheroes and the change in direction that our protagonist wanted to take in her life from the moment she learned she was pregnant. All scenes of the Bride / Beatrix Kiddo with Bill, whether at the beginning or at the end of the film, are purely in the best Tarantino style. In addition, the director tells us what the Bride's real name is, how she learned to wield a sword in very good-natured scenes with master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu).Now with less exaggeration, less reference and a film with a much more paced rhythm, 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' bets on phenomenal dialogues, script and free controlled violence. If the first focused much more on the plot and all its explosive action, now we have the focus shifted to the beginning and end of the story, the humanization of the characters and the reasons why we support them, where in fact we know everything. that happened until they reached that point at the conclusion of the film. The Bride, especially, thus becomes the most human character in the vast gallery and Tarantino.In addition to the Bride, we also know the other characters. In Budd's case, we even get to know where he lives, where he works and what he does outside work. Bill is already an extremely interesting character, as we know his motivations for the sadistic act that started the story. Tarantino gives us a choice of who to support, presenting reasons, even if not rational, strong for Bill to have done his slaughter. With a cast chosen in the right measure to give meaning and motivations to the characters, everything becomes more visceral. For knowing how to conduct the work in these different aspects in comparison to volume 1 and, managing to deliver everything that is expected, we see a great leap by the filmmaker towards the real authorial work. Now Tarantino fans will be able to delight in all the director's signatures.As with Sergio Leone's westerns, everything is very slow. Just to give you an idea, the Bride kills only one person throughout the film, but everything that happens has meaning and makes sense. The best part of this second part is its ability to subvert all expectations, bypassing them in a wise way, without frustrating them, but surprising with creativity and innovation. There are crucial moments in the plot that leave the viewer simply without imagining what will happen next, leading him to believe that the story has reached a dead end. It is not because it was a more serious and profound film that he doesn't have fun and is funny. The perfect example of this is in the figure of the master Pai Mei, extremely arrogant, but very wise. In its scenes, the technical part recreates precisely the types of samurai films on which the character was based. Although references are in lower numbers, in Volume 2 they are more obvious.The soundtrack, as in all of the director's works, is yet another character in both volumes. On the two soundtracks, the songs range from country music to selections of spaghetti western punctuated by Ennio Morricone. Bernard Herrmann's theme from the film Twisted Nerve is whistled by the fearsome Elle Driver on the hospital scene. When The Bride enters Casa das Folhas Azuis, the go-go group The 5.6.7.8's plays 'I Walk Like Jayne Mansfield', 'I'm Blue' and 'Woo Hoo'. The connection with Lady Snowblood is further established by the use of 'The Flower of Carnage' in the final theme of the film and we cannot forget Gheorghe Zamfir The in the beautiful song 'Lonely Shepherd'. It also plays the song 'Shot Me Down', at the beginning of Vol. 1. In general, the songs on both volumes are very eclectic and that goes well with the film which also justifies the fact that the soundtrack was so acclaimed and considered by many one of the best of recent times.Tarantino gave more life to his work, more reason and more feeling to everything. If the saga of revenge 'Kill Bill' had not been divided into two fundamentally the same, but in detail different. The way it was done, Tarantino gave us two masterpieces, two odes to genre cinema that work each in their own unique way to the point that it is an arduous task to choose which one is the best. The works complement each other. It remains to be seen whether a single three-hour film could not further raise the status of films. 'Kill Bill Vol. 2' is a sadistic, creative adventure full of pop references that serve both to honor and to please a new audience. The combination of the two volumes mixes everything and gives consistency to enter the mind of one of the most relevant directors of cinema.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
142,gregsrants,You won't find a better movie this year,8,20 April 2004,"You gotta love this Tarantino guy.  Having made only three movies in 11 years, he came back to the spotlight in 2003 with the ultra-violent and critically acclaimed, Kill Bill Vol.1.  The movie was another non-linear story about a pregnant bride who seeks revenge over the fellow thugs that massacred her at her wedding rehearsal, and in particular, the ringleader and former lover, Bill.  Now, just six months removed from local theatres comes the next chapter of the vigilante in the suitably titled Kill Bill Vol. 2.Reprising her role as The Bride (although the films were shot simultaneously, so the word reprising might not be appropriate) is Uma Thurman.  For those that remember, she awoke from a four-year coma in Vol. 1 and quickly began her roaring rampage of revenge on O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green, two of the five participants in her botched murder.That left Ellie Driver (Darryl Hannah), Budd (Michael Madsen) and father figure Bill (David Carradine) to cross of the list and The Bride begins with Bill's brother Budd.  Not that this is where the movie begins however.  In true Tarantino style, Vol. 2 actually starts before the massacres of O-Ren Ishii and Vernita.  A black and white opening chapter takes us back to the wedding chapel where the assault takes place and we understand more of the love Bill has for The Bride and how his jealousy overtakes him.  Actually, Vol. 2 goes even further back in the past and spends a good portion of its 21/2 hour running time showing a quiet fireside moment between Bill and The Bride and later her training with a martial arts and discipline trainer, Pai Mei.  I was sure that if Tarantino had another hour from the studio, we would have seen The Bride's birth and first communion.Kill Bill Vol. 2 is an extension of Vol. 1 that together showcases the best of Quentin's talent.  Where Vol. 1 had all the violence, blood and a pussy wagon, Vol. 2 has conversations about Superman, a reunion with a long lost daughter and a focus on the motivation for each character.Don't get me wrong; Vol. 2 has more than the average movie's share of action and carnage.  When The Bride first encounters Budd, she is shot with salt bullets and then buried alive.  Her resurrection then leads her back to Budd's trailer where Ellie is finishing up some business and soon the two are involved in a catfight involving swords, fists and even a television antenna.   Kept within the confines of the tight trailer space, the fight claustrophobically exciting with a conclusion that will leave you wishing you were not listening in Dolby Digital.The biggest difference between the two volumes will probably be what the average filmgoer complains about the most, and that is the dialogue. Known for character rants on everyday conversation topics like a Madonna song (Reservoir Dogs) or a Quarter Pounder in Europe (Pulp Fiction), Tarantino has always been praised on how he whips verbiage to his audience with such fluent accuracy that you marvel at it's insightful perceptions, yet it is probably no different from a conversation you would have with a friend or neighbor.  In Vol.2, he exploits his gift and whether it is Ellie reading an internet history on the Black Mamba snake or Bill telling the story about his favorite superhero we are subjected to long speeches that take their time and unfold like origami.But despite all the gibber jabber between characters, it will not be a sentence or an expression that you will remember when you leave the theatre. Instead, you will remember The Bride being buried alive and fighting her way out of the darkness.  You will remember how Ellie lost her fight and you will laugh at how she is remembered in the final credits.  And you will remember that The Bride gets her revenge even if they don't all fall as a result of her hands.To say that Kill Bill Vol. 1 is better than Vol. 2 or the other way around is to forget that they were shot simultaneously and is essentially the same movie split in two so that Miramax can make as much money as possible. Both are definitely unique in their style and presentation.  You may not appreciate Vol.2 after being so wound up after the fight with the 88's at the conclusion of 1, but give it a couple of months and watch both volumes back to back on DVD.  You won't find a more unique or better film this year I'll bet.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
143,agmoldham,It could have been a classic film,5,25 April 2004,"It seems that a lot of people on imdb consider Tarantino to be the greatest director of all time. As such, I'm sure that this film will shoot into many peoples top 10's along with Vol 1, Dogs and Fiction. I myself find his work increasingly indulgent although Vol 2 suffers slightly less from this than Vol 1.Overall Vol 2 is better than Vol 1, which isn't really surprising since Vol 1 didn't really have a conclusion. I think if the two films were edited down to a single feature running about 135 minutes we could have a real classic film. This is the 'Special Edition' I would like to see released.Anyway Vol 2 has a few of the trademark Tarantino dialogues and David Carradine steels the acting honours. Uma Thurman also puts in a good performance in the lead. Although it does drag slightly at times there's always a good scene that arrives just in time to save the day. 7/10.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
144,rainking_es,"Tarantino, the one-eyed...",8,15 August 2004,"Some critics say that Tarantino is nothing but a copycat. A guy with huge cinematographic knowledges that copies scenes and arguments from other movies that are completely unknown for most of the people (so nobody is gonna accuse him of copying something from a movie that no one's has seen). I agree with that up to a point, because he has ""stolen"" stuff from other movies since the very beginning. He's the kind of artist that ""inspires"" himself looking other's people work; but he's not the first, and won't be the last. Bowie did it, Warhol did it too, the Rolling Stones, even Picasso did. Hey, I'm not comparing Tarantino to that people, because for me Quentin Tarantino is not a genius (neither Warhol): for me is just a very smart guy, so talented, and so smart. He's just taking advantage of the fact that Hollywood only makes rubbish. So, as it's said here in Spain: in the land of the deaf, the one-eyed is the King. So, that's what Tarantino is: the one-eyed. He'd hardly stand out from 1930 to 1975. OK, let's talk about Kill Bill Vol.2:There's this saying ""after the storm the calm comes"". Kill Bill Vol.1 was the storm, the explosion, the action; and Kill Bill Vol.2 is the calm, the drama, less dynamic, but much more intense (emotionally intense). In Vol.2 The kicks, the killings, etc. from the first volume make way to the life-story of The Bride. Her personality, her relationship with Bill, her doubts and her fears, her training... her past. There's only one fight scene in Kill Bill Vol.1, the one between Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah. But this doesn't mean KB2 is sort of a boring movie. No way. For me is the best of the 5 Tarantino movies, and the more serious. He may have copied ideas from some other movies, but he has definitely makes a great movie out of those ""inspirations"" (and that's not easy to do). Maybe the final parts are too slow. The scenes with the Bride's daughter are not like Tarantino's... they're too sugary. But I guess the original story ends that way so there's nothing Tarantino could do about it. Uma Thurman makes the perform of his life, and so does David Carradine (though I think he's never been a great actor). Tarantino has the ability to resurrect the dead: he did it with Travolta, Keitel and Pam Grier in the past, and so he does with Hannah or Carradine in Kill Bill. Kill Bill Vol.2, one of the best Hollywood movies from 2004.PS: I assume the middle-American doesn't know a thing about Spanish or Mexican cultures. But Tarantino is a man of the world, so he should know how ridiculous is to put flamenco music in a scene that takes place in Mexico. In México they have rancheras, corridos, etc. but not Flamenco.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

146,TheNorthernMonkee,cleverly made second half of a Tarantino gem,9,23 February 2005,"SPOILERS In recent cinema history, there are probably no directors who can write and direct stylish films as Quentin Tarantino. With a back catalogue including the new flawless ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992) and award winning ""Pulp Fiction"" (1994), Tarantino writes from an angle which is both endearing and genius. As a man who has worked in a movie store and has had a long running love of cinema, Tarantino creates the types of film he wants to watch himself. He uses his own personal knowledge to create films which not only contain facts and trivia, but which tend to remain as tributes to classic styles.As a fan of classic martial arts films, in 2003, Tarantino released the first of his two part epic ""Kill Bill"". Telling the story of an assassin out for revenge, the first film was a masterful piece of cinema which, whilst maybe lacked slightly in substance, remained a stylish bloodbath, which any martial arts fan could happily sit and enjoy. In 2004, the second part of the film was released, and amazingly this film was significantly different to the first. Whilst part one was a stylish piece of constant bloodshed, this second encounter is much more plot driven, whilst retaining that inherent beauty. As good, if not better, as the first part, this concluding chapter in the story of the Bride (Uma Thurman) is yet another fine addition to anyone's DVD collection.The Bride, or ""Black Mamba"" (Thurman) is out for revenge. Having dispatched two members of the assassination squad sent to kill her, this film deals with her pursuit of the remaining members, Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and Budd (Michael Madsen). With these two eliminated from the equation, the Bride has plans to finally kill the one man who ordered her death, her old master, and friend, Bill (David Carradine).Upon the original announcement made by Tarantino that he would be splitting this film into two segments, there were many who questioned the chances of success. Well, with two finely constructed films, we have our answers. Whilst not quite as amazing as the one long, uncut, film would have been, both parts are worthy reminders of Tarantino's genius.In this second part in particular, there are so many superb qualities worthy of mention.Led by a great performance by Thurman and a constantly intimidating performance by Carradine, the films acting staff thrive with the exquisite script. Everyone puts in a good job, right down from the main cast, through to the creepy Esteban Vihaio (Michael Parks).The true beauty of ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"" however is once again the way Tarantino has filmed it. With a black and white opening scene covering the original massacre of the wedding party, this film oozes style. When it returns to colour, it doesn't just return to your normal every day colours, but it returns to bright, vivid colours which stand out on the screen. Bill's house towards the end in particular is rich in texture and is just incredibly bright.As well as colour, this film again has a stunning soundtrack. Whilst admittedly not as good as the ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992) soundtrack, Tarantino still manages to put some wonderful pieces of music throughout, whether orchestral or from his own CD collection.In fact, ""Kill Bill: Volume 2"" suffers from the one minor problem that it's not quite as good as Tarantino's early work. Whilst the two parts mixed together to make one film would quite easily make anyone's top ten films list, the parts separated do feel weak compared to true classics like ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"". To say a director/writer's film is inferior to his earlier work is not an insult to the later work, but rather an enormous compliment to the previous pieces. Tarantino has created some of the most stylish films of the last twenty years, and whilst the two separate parts of ""Kill Bill"" are neither as good as his earlier stuff, nor as good as a combined piece would probably be, they are still wonderful films, and this second half is another Tarantino beauty.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
147,FilmOtaku,A beautiful continuation of the first volume,9,19 April 2004,"What can I say?  I'm a hard-core Tarantino fan and Kill Bill Vol. 2 was just as excellent as I thought it would be.  Vol. 1 was my favorite film of 2003, and I think that Vol. 2 compliments that film beautifully, while having the substance to be a stand-alone film.  The various forms of cinematography that Tarantino employs are just as fun and stunning as Vol. 1, but this time we have a fantastic and hilarious homage to kung fu films of the seventies during The Bride's flashback to her training with Pai Mei, her master.  The cinematography/photography was straight from the old Shaw Bros. films, and the slightest details show that QT is a huge fan, and knows some of the audience may be as well.  I can't say I was less entertained during this film as I was during the first, but I was entertained in a different manner.  The non-stop action is not here, and the gore is significantly lowered, but the story is excellent and has a heart.  Uma Thurman is once again absolutely radiant in this role  the role of The Bride was written for her and partly by her, and she is incredible.  I've never been a fan of hers personally, but I really admired her work in this film.  I gave Kill Bill Vol. 1 a `10' rating on IMDB, and I would give Vol. 2 a `9'.  And together, I would give them a 10.  This was QT's opus, and I'll deal with not having a movie from him for several years if this is the material he will be putting out.--Shelly",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
148,HabibieHakim123,Almost Perfect,9,20 February 2021,"""Kill Bill Volume 2 is like the softer and calm version of the first one, all of the performance is still very good, i really enjoyed this continuing chapter, but there is couple of thing that kinda missing here, the goryness and the bloodiness, i mean they still have that but not as much as the first one, and the second is the final battle, the moment that i've been waiting for is done so fast, i think it will be more something if they do it more, guess Uma Thurman is already tired to fight long like what she did to O-Ren, but besides all of that Kill Bill Volume 2 is still a solid sequel there's a lot of great stuff in here that i really want to write but i don' t like to critiqued a scene in a non-spoiler review, overall Kill Bill Volume 2 is almost perfect, i highly recommended""",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
149,AngelHonesty,No Disapointments,7,22 November 2020,"Normally part one of any film is the best and the films that follow in sequence get worse after ever one. Surprisingly enough this movie felt like a continuing of part one. Picking up exactly where it left off and never missing a beat as the story continues. I liked the second better then the first because you finally got the entire back story of what exactly is going on mixed in with kick-ass action and a great ending. Hats off to this film. If you liked volume one, then volume two is a must see.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
150,Pedro_H,Pertinacious junk - the most expensive B movie ever made.,4,11 February 2006,"A former key member of a comic book "" assassination squad"" (Uma Thurnan) is almost killed on her wedding day and continues (from Part 1) her quest to get her own back on the her would-be killers.(Will she succeed? Oh, the tension, the tension.) Since Pulp Fiction every movie that Quentin Tarantino has made is worse than the last. This, at least, keeps up his record. Maybe we will realise that he is, really, a one/two trick pony - although that is not to say that some people won't be entertained by the limited tricks until the day they die.Most adults have to go to work so they don't have all day to read comic books, watch bad movies and read third rate pulp fiction (small case). Q (as he is sometimes billed) only rarely rises from his chair to work -- although I am sure he classes a 1,000 interviews (in which he often refers to the praise of others!) as work -- so he has plenty of time to do the above. The result is the kind of film we see here. Tired clichés and po faced speeches that we are supposed to take seriously.(Or are tired clichés and ""bad"" reborn as irony?) Those that got-off on the senseless violence of Part 1 will be surprised by the restraint of Part 2. While it retains the back of the cigarette packet plot it does have moments of humour and irony -- although the script is not half as clever as it thinks it is.They say that the Beatles audience was more interesting that the group -- fans of this film are more interesting than the film. Everyone can see something different in the mist. Feel free to like and dislike -- but this has a silly IMDb score...",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
151,Ben_Cheshire,"KB sums Tarantino up: all bark, no bite.",2,27 June 2004,"Kill Bill is variously indulgent, shocking, corny, genre-clichéd, self-reflexive and plain thievery. Despite the fact that it tries to be a million other movies, in the end its hard to say what exactly Kill Bill is, and that's the highest compliment i can pay it.I'm exaggerating, though, because Kill Bill is nothing more than a sickeningly simple revenge story taken intravenously from Sergio Leone with samurai philosophy and fights with big buildups that don't end up happening.Look back at the final fight of Vol 1, or Elle Driver's demise in Vol 2 - they sum up what frustrates me about Kill Bill, and Tarantino's personality - a whole lot of build up (drawn-out closeups with crecendoing music before the fight; talking your movie up in interviews before its premiere) then a soft fizzle (Lucy Liu can't really operate a sword - there's just a whole lot of running around, smoke and mirrors, hardly even one sword-clash, before the final blow... Elle Driver: The Bride pulls her eye out instead of the fight happening). There is so much build up with music pilfered from other people's movie scores (mainly of Morricone music), that nobody seems to notice that the actual fight never happens!Tarantino tries to convince us he does this on purpose, under the guise of ""f**king with the audience.""Tarantino talks so much he'll always find some way of making his movie sound clever - but in the end, the talk's cleverer than the cinema is. Movies aren't essentially linguistic - that's books. Movies consist of moving images, and by reducing that to words you avoid discussing the reality of the movie itself, distort it and pretend its something its not. This is an artifact of all reviews, including this one - but there's something a whole lot less objective about the way Tarantino raves about why his own movies are clever. Unfortunately, Kill Bill requires us to think of movies like Quentin does to think its clever.Quentin's constantly pointing out ""look how I f**k with the audience"" is a method of distracting us from the content of the movie. Quentin seems to have forgotten that its the audience he's supposed to be entertaining, not himself. Movies are entertainment - at least, genre movies are. What QT considers ""clever,"" I say is indulgent and makes for an impoverished movie-viewing experience.He can describe the movie however he wants, but the reality of watching the movie is that every scene runs uncomfortable long, the dialogue delivery is corny (though much worse in Vol 1), his ""references"" grow to dominate his movies more and more, so that the end product is more synthetic than organic, the performances are 100 % Ham, and the style-over-substance (and not an original style anyway) nature of it results in a pretentious, empty experience.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
152,EijnarAmadeus,As good as the first,9,22 May 2004,"spoilers. The first KILL BILL VOL.1 is a bloody, insane and adrenalin-kicking spectacle that truly made me loving movies even more. Looking very much forward to VOLUME 2 I really got what I wanted. KILL BILL VOL.2 is not as bloody, not as action packed, not as insane or not as Eastern inspired, but it's just as good! Here Tarantino has slowed it all down and we get to know the characters more. Uma Thurman is just as fantastic as the main character The Bride aka Black Mamba aka Beatrix Kiddo (that most be the coolest name ever!) Uma slashed both Vernita Green/Copperhead and O-Ren Ishii/Cottomouth in the first, but there's still tree standing tall. Elle Driver, Budd and Bill himself. Quentin Tarantino being, probably, the best director in the world does his job simply perfect! It kicks a lot of ass, especially the scene between Elle Driver and The Bride in a caravan, wow! KILL BILL VOL.2 is Tarantino's western movie, and a beautiful part is when Budd picks up The Bride laying on the ground heavily wounded and you can clearly hear the brilliant theme from Morricone in Eastwood's early on movies. It's almoust pity that it's all over, we'll probably never see something like this again!STARS: 5/5",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
153,mikayakatnt,A great conclusion to the story,9,18 May 2020,"An amazing ending to the first film.Normally I'm skeptical of sequels but this one delivered on my expectations and then some. Tarantino's world-building and storytelling are showcased in this film as powerfully as the first film. The style of this film is distinct from the first one and provides a breathtaking view of the Kill Bill universe.4.5/5. Over-the-top, satisfying, and bloody brilliant.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
154,jessegehrig,w.t.f.,6,10 July 2013,"To be fair almost all of Kill Bill 2 is a great movie, the only flaw is the ending, but oh what a flaw. The ending of Kill Bill 2 is equivalent to hiring the two greatest chefs alive putting them in fully stocked fully equipped kitchen with many fabulous ingredients to then pit these two master chefs against each other in some ultimate cook-off challenge, only to be settled by the two chefs calling take-out. Why build tension for a combat showdown climax of your movie if you then have your protagonist and antagonist talk it out? Maybe it's just me, maybe I'm the uncouth clod who thinks that when two opposing kung fu masters meet up at the end of a movie so as to settle an old score that those fighters should fight. I mean do you want to watch a porno where the big stud and the hot bimbo just talk things over and decide to just be friends? I do not understand.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
155,TheOtherFool,Why oh why,4,4 June 2004,"As I feel it, Tarantino got away with Volume 1 of his revenge saga, as there were some elements in it most people (like me) not so much adore or find absolutely fantastic, but at least it was a movie you can like, laugh at and even admire (in particular the effects). Too bad you can do none of the above with Volume 2, as this conclusion must be one of the biggest let-downs in cinema-history.'The Bride' (Uma Thurman), as we learnt from Vol. 1, is on a killing spree after 'Bill' and his assasins killed her soon-to-be husband, family and friends on her wedding (or, as we know now, her wedding rehearsel, but never mind that). In part one she killed of Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox) and Cottontooth (Lucy Liu), now the time has come for Elle (Daryll Hannah) and Budd (Michael Madsen). And the inevitable Bill, of course.She starts of with Budd, who apparently traded his 'killer-life' for a trailer in the desert, working as a bouncer/toilet cleaner in a local bar. But Budd knows The Bride is coming for revenge, so when The Bride is planning to surprise him, he's way ahead of her, shoots her down and buries her 6 feet under. But this movie wouldn't be called 'Kill Bill' if, well, Bill wasn't killed, so the Bride gets out (in the best scene of the movie), remembering a trick she learnt from Pai Mei. So we have a flashback to Pai Mei, training The Bride for her life as a killer. Think The Karate Kid. This scene has so little to do with the movie and is so silly, it's right here where the movie takes a downfall.Back to the story then. The Bride gets out of her grave and kills Budd and Elle (who happened to be in Budds trailer as well), and goes out to find Bill. But not before she has an encounter with Esteban Vihaio, some pimp who knows Bill. So we hear the whole story with Esteban etc. etc. etc. Throwing in some interesting characters who have nothing to do with your movie doesn't mean the movie is getting more interesting, you know...When The Bride finally meets Bill there's a surprise for her: her kid (of which Bill is the father) wasn't killed at the massacre but has now turned into a 4 year old girl. The 'end fight' of The Bride and Bill should've been the highlight of this saga, but turns out to be so dull it's beyond belief.As this whole 'Volume' is boring, useless, and in the end really unsatisfying.4/10 for the OK first hour I guess.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
156,tomimt,Fulfilling final part of a great movie,8,23 January 2005,"Might contain spoilers So it all ends. Bride's bloody rampage must have it's inevitable conclusion in this sequel of Kill Bill. But this isn't actually a sequel, 'Kill Bill vol.2' is more of an last part of a movie. even tough they both have pretty different atmosphere.Where 'Kill Bill vol.1' was more of an Hong Kong style action flick, 'Kill Bill vol.2' is more of an western/HK flick. Not so bad mixture. Also 'Kill Bill vol.2' is more plot driven than the first, which was one big battle sequence. We get to know characters better in 'Vol, 2' We learn about Bill (Carradine) and his brother Budd (Michael Madsen) We learn about 'The Bride' (Uma Thurman) and Elle Driver(Daryl Hannah). All very capable actors. Oh and watch out for cameo by Samuel L. Jackson.There's also action in the movie, but scenes are not so overblown than they were in the first part, but they do have same unbelievability aspect in them. So no brain usage during action. Might spoil your fun.There's also been debate which one is better, 1 or 2. My conclusion is, that they both are as good, but in little other terms. In all honesty I don't know if i would have liked 'Vol 2' if it would have been entirely similar to first part.It could have made this movie much more boring.I gave this movie same score I gave to 'Kill Bill vol.1', a 8 out of 10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
157,gigan-92,The Incredible Climax!!,9,24 March 2010,"The story continues!! Having already defeated two of her five targets, Uma Thurman now focuses on Bill, a man whom we have yet a great deal to know. This film dives ever deeper into The Bride's past, including her estranged relationship with Bill and the shocking revelations that were hinted at the end of Volume I. This film is much less centered on the action itself but instead the relationships between these characters. I believe this works rather well considering the first piece was a gruesome thrill ride, and this one slows it down just a bit. Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah are among her final opponents, and both could get a lot more development in this film. Tarantino still pays tribute to Japanese and Hong Kong action films, but this too is tone down. And for all the build up there are still some well-served fight sequences.Near the climax there is a showdown of a different kind between Bill and the Bride. By now we know her real name, but I'd rather not reveal it to those who have yet to see it. It's not just a battle of martial arts and swords, or even a literal battle of vengeance. Whoever takes victory this time will also decide the fate of the child, The Bride's daughter. Such an emotional fascade surely will entertain watchers even more so than any action scene.

As a sequel to last year's very over the top and very violent flick with many throwbacks to martial arts classics, it's often funny but also well put together and watchable elsewhere.However, is it time to ask the question as to whether Tarantino is becoming old hat?  Throughout the film I had an undercurrent going around in my head that this was following what is becoming a set pattern for Tarantino films -- they're becoming a tad manufactured.  As he makes them at significant intervals, this isn't as much of an issue but are his films now becoming over crafted?  Is he becoming a parody of himself?As ever, let's see his next move.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
159,Bogmeister,The Bride Ends Her Rampage; We Applaud,9,15 August 2005,"The 2nd half of Tarantino's tale of bloody revenge doesn't have the spectacular battles, except for a one-on-one in a trailer, but it more than makes up for this fact with a sublime quality only possible from a master filmmaker. The wronged Bride (Uma Thurman) succeeds in tracking down Bill (Carradine), after a couple more confrontations with ex-compadres. The picture is also filled out with more detail of events prior to her coma, enriching what we already know about all the characters. Think about a half-dozen of your favorite films which never had sequels, which had characters you wish you could see more about. All of a sudden, here it is - volume two: the mysterious faceless Bill is revealed early in all his glory. As Bill, David Carradine strolls into the picture with all the grace and steely charm of a lost king, returned to show us all how it's done. As he says near the beginning, ""I'm the man."" That might sound trite and funny coming from anyone else; here, he makes you believe it in the same second and proves it throughout. By the end, he really is a scary son of a gun, without even having to kill anyone on screen.The whole picture comes across as a more mature, polished upgrade of the exciting volume one. It doesn't get a full 10 stars from me due to Tarantino's indulgence in dragging out certain scenes (the one with Bill's brother's boss harassing Budd could have been accomplished in half the time). But Tarantino makes good use of the secondary characters played by Hannah and Madsen. Hannah comes across as a more spiteful version of The Bride and just as tough. As with many players who enter the Tarantino universe, this may be her best role. Madsen, brought back from his breakthrough in Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs""(92), seems very at ease as the self-destructive Budd. And then, of course, you have Gordon Liu as the master - unforgettable! But it's still up to Uma to carry the show, which she does. Tarantino really gets the most out of her when she needs to explode, whether in anger or outrage, or just about any strong emotion; she does it with a suddenness that startles us - towards the end when she bursts into the room where Bill is waiting and sees what she sees. Her entire body seems to convulse and we're all heaving with emotion right along with her.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

161,movieguy1021,Kill Bill: Volume Two: 6/10,6,23 April 2004,"Most people waited six years from Jackie Brown to see Kill Bill: Volume One, the next eagerly awaited movie by Quentin Tarantino. I did not have to, since I had seen none of his previous works. I did, however, see Volume One, and loved it, making this six month wait for Volume Two almost unbearable. The two films, originally to be fused together as an epic, could not be any more different. While Volume One was relentlessly and gleefully violent, without much in the way of plot or characters, a truly entertaining movie. Volume Two, however, was a complete 180: it's mainly a talking heads movie, with a few (generally) non-violent fights, an over development of characters and plot, and a style that Tarantino seems to be stealing from his own classic movie.The Bride (Uma Thurman), a deadly assassin, after having been put into a coma in a wedding chapel by her employer Bill (David Carradine), awakens four years later and swears to kill all involved in that massacre. By the opening of Volume Two, she had already gotten two of them. Next on her list is Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), Budd (Michael Madsen), and, of course, Bill.I would have loved to see one four-hour long version of Kill Bill. The series just doesn't work as two parts. They're completely different; if they were one, then, being fused together, it would work perfectly. The first half wouldn't be this extremely entertaining part and then suddenly switching over to drama. Basically, though, that's what the movies are if placed side-by-side. There's not even much material to link the two. Events mentioned in Volume One are shown, but the only repeated scene was the opening scene in the first one, one that wasn't needed to be repeated. Why not show some of the fight between The Bride and O-Ren Iishi (Lucy Liu), or, when The Bride's daughter comes into play, a flashback for when she killed Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) in front of the latter's daughter? They seem like two completely different movies (when they're supposed to be one complete movie separated into two parts).But enough comparisons between the two. Let me go into the specifics of Volume Two. Almost everybody, if not everybody, loves Pulp Fiction, understandably. It's Tarantino's masterpiece. The trouble is, we've come to expect Pulp Fiction from everything he does. Now, Volume One was no Pulp Fiction, but it was just as entertaining, if not more so. I was at least hoping as much for Volume Two. Tarantino has become so cocky in his directing that he believes that any well-written dialogue is entertaining dialogue. This movie's dialogue is well-written, but has nothing to do with the plot and isn't entertaining. It's not funny, nor amusing. In Tarantino's script, we get backstory on people who don't need backstory, which always annoys me. I must admit, however, that the eyeball thing is one of the funniest things I have ever seen.The fight scenes (though few and far between) were amazing. The obvious training that everyone went through must have been quite rigorous. That was always fun to watch and always entertaining. I must also comment on the cinematography. Oftentimes I found myself wondering how they managed to do that. It amazed me in Volume One, also. Its sweeping views, long shots, close-ups, etc. were simply spectacular. Something not so spectacular, however, was Tarantino's ""stylish"" choices. A few scenes were shot in black-and-white for no reason, others in partial color for no reason, and others in 1.33:1 aspect ration (the size of your TV screen) for no reason. Why? Because he can, I suppose. The black-and-white sequences meant something in Volume One-the difference between an R and an NC-17. But they were completely worthless here.Volume Two is an entertaining movie for the most part. Some of the dialogue became repetitive and was unnecessary, but for the most part it was a fun watch. Thurman is great, as usual, and was even better here than in the first. Carradine had more to do, but I found him rather flat. Hannah, as Driver, was very good, because her character was more interesting than Madsen's Budd. Madsen, to me, will always be Mr. Blonde, the best part of Reservoir Dogs, to me. I must say, I am disappointed by how this chapter of the killing of Bill is as a whole, but in fifteen years or so, we can look forward to a Volume Three. I'll be first in line there.My rating: 6/10Rated R for violence, language and brief drug use.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

I will give Tarantino credit, however, for having introduced me to some new Ennio Morricone scores. Since this man can't even be bothered to hire composers to compose original scores, he may as well steal the best music around, and no one is better than Morricone. During the movie I was more excited whenever I heard a new track by Morricone than anything I actually saw.So for widening my musical horizons a bit more, and for giving me Bill at last, I rate this movie slightly above the first volume.

165,LoneWolfAndCub,Great Ending To QT's Tale Of Revenge,10,7 September 2005,"Kill Bill Volume 2 (directed by Quentin Tarantino) is a great, great movie. I don't know why Uma Thurman didn't get nominated for Best Actress because she gives a fantastic, emotional performance. There really is nothing wrong with this movie. The soundtrack is great, the directing brilliant and the dialogue better than the first.In Vol. 2 we follow The Bride's story of revenge. For those who haven't seen the first: The Bride (Uma Thurman) was gunned down at her wedding by the DIVAS. She has killed O-Ren Ishii (AKA Cottonmouth) and Vernita Green (AKA Copperhead). She still needs to kill Budd ""Sidewinder"" (Michael Madsen), Elle ""California Mountain Snake"" (Daryl Hannah) and of course Bill ""Snake Charmer"" (David Carradine). In typical QT style we flash back and forth, revealing The Bride's past and how she came to be such a good fighter.This, as I said before, is flawless. Uma Thurman gives a wonderful performance. Daryl Hannah plays a villain very well. Michael Madsen and David Carradine also give great performances. The music in this is wonderful and suits the movie perfectly. Luckily Vol. 2 has some better dialogue that we can remember.The fight scenes in this are very well done and keep us watching. QT has done a great job summing this tale up.5/5.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

I liked the first one but didn't really know everything that was going on, but just knowing that she set off the kill 5 individuals who left her dead at her wedding. So I saw Kill Bill: Vol 2 and liked it highly. The movie answered all of my questions to the previous one and had much of a better story and was not unrealistic that much. We finally get to see Bill, who is played by David Carradine who had a really good role in the movie. There is a great conclusion to the movie and had a very good story, along with likable characters, my favorite being Budd. Overall, good movie that answers tons of questions.

And Uma Thurman as the Bride goes on to wreak havoc in her revenge plan, until she finds her ex-boss and arch-nemesis, Bill.  It's an exciting story!  The body count isn't as high as it was in ""Vol. 1,"" but there's still plenty of gore and pain.  The Bride's harsh training under Pai Mei is rather painful to watch!  Quentin Tarantino's use of cinematic styles sell the story, with references to the genres of kung fu and the spaghetti western.  His use of music is also used well to set the feel of every scene. Tarantino might not be done with some of these characters, and it'll be interesting to see how their stories will continue.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
168,johnnymonsarrat,Jon Monsarrat review: Not too violent or arty,8,26 April 2004,"There's something about violence, where if it's cartoony, then it's just fun to see stuff blow up. Like most action films. But if it's overly realistic, such as Black Hawn Down, a war film, then it's like being in a war. That's just horrifying. Nobody thinks a war experience is a fun thing to see at the movies.Except for Quentin Tarantino fans, who have something of the sick humor about them. Pulp Fiction has a lot of real pain mixed in with happy music and likable sadists. I sort of liked Reservoir Dogs but the endless blood was too much for me. The pain is realistic, not cartoony.I'm turned off by that, so I skipped Kill Bill Volume One and I almost didn't see Volume Two. But I went and fortunately the violence was cartoony and generally fine. On a par with Training Day. Not as bad as RoboCop. So having gotten past that, yes, the film was interesting, arty and very creative, often funny, with several neat twists.Who should see this film:-- Action film junkies, but not young teens-- Anyone who's been curious like me but worried about violence, you'll be fineI'll give Kill Bill: Vol. 2 an 8 out of 10.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
169,SquigglyCrunch,"Deeper and More Interesting Than the First, yet Still Bloody and Action-Packed",7,24 October 2015,"Kill Bill Volume 2 continues off of Kill Bill Volume 1 (obviously), which I enjoyed quite a bit. Kill Bill Volume 2, however, is better if you ask me.The movie is more focused on the story and development of who The Bride is, and how she ended up in her predicament. It's really interesting to see how it all went down, and that it was a lot 'smaller scale' than I originally thought. This actually confused me for a while, but it was really nice to get it all cleared up. The other characters are more delved into as well and that really adds to the movie. Now with all this story and development you may think ""What about the action that the first movie did so well?"" Well, we got an even better fight scene in this one. Sure, the whole thing isn't completely consumed by action, unlike the first one, but the second installment still manages to throw in the best fight in the series and one of the best I've ever seen. Bill and The Bride's relationship is brought into better light by the end, and I must say that I was impressed. It was a lot deeper than I originally thought, which was a really nice touch. Overall, Kill Bill Volume 2 has the great fights that the first one did, but just with more development this time around. It's a great conclusion to the 2 part series. If you liked the first one, you'll like the second one. If your interested in the first one but decided to research the second one for some reason, then watch the first one and then watch the second. Their both great action movies that any action-lover needs to watch.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
170,MichaelMargetis,Supersedes Volume 1!,10,2 April 2005,"This has to be the movie I anticipated the most in my life. The ending of Volume 1 left me hanging not only for four months which was stated when the first installment was released, but for six months since the release of Vol. 2 was delayed two months due to problems on the cutting room floor. I won't lie, after the credits started to role I was a little disappointed. If I had not of been, Kill Bill Vol. 2 would be the best movie I would have seen, ever! Well, it wasn't but it definitely made my Top 100 list along with Vol. 1. The fact of the matter is Vol. 2 is not only better then Vol. 1, it's more involving. Unlike Vol. 1, Kill Bill Vol. 2 has less action and violence (which may turn off immature and blood thirsty viewers after the blood soaked Volume 1), but it explains the plot to it's full extent. In Volume 1 you didn't get a stable plot, you just got stylized acting and blood (not that is an insult), but in Volume 2 you get a little more closure.The second installation in Quentin Tarantino's chop-sake meets wild west crime saga, The Bride continues her blood-hungry hunt for the three remaining members on her list. The first is Budd, Bill's brother played expertly by Michael Madsen (Species, Reservoir Dogs). He's a hard-drinking depressed cowboy-hat wearing fella, who works as a bouncer at a low-level tit bar. The second person on The Bride's list is someone she really hates and someone who really hates her -- Elle Driver, the foul-mouthed eye-patch wearing blonde-haired trouble maker who is now Bill's sweetie. Perhaps the best fight sequence of the film is the showdown between the Bride and Elle in a broken down trailer home involving a toilet, samurai swords and tobacco spit. The final person on The Bride's list is of course, Bill. You finally get to see Bill in full form in Volume 2, and he is played with such intensity and passion by David Carradine (who definitely gives the best performance of the entire movie.) The acting in Volume 2 is a major improvement then the acting in Volume 1. Uma Thurman still gives a rock solid performance as the sexy blonde sword fighter on a mission, and the villains this time around are way better. Lucy Liu and Vivica A. Fox don't come close to the acting talents of Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah and David Carradine. In this one, the villains are also more developed and you get a better grasp of the kinds of people they are. The directing is fabulous as usual, along with the writing, and the soundtrack is more alive in Vol. 2 then it was in Vol. 1.In conclusion, Kill Bill Volume 2 wasn't as extraordinary as I had expected, but it is certainly another masterpiece from one of the greatest filmmakers of our generation, Quentin Tarantino.

173,dragokin,same side of the coin,4,26 October 2013,"Discussing which part of Kill Bill is better is fruitless. It is not even talking about two sides of a coin, rather comparing two sides of the same apple. It is one and the same movie cut into two parts. Tarantino was either not willing or not able to produce a scenario that would stretch over three movie.Anyhow, David Carradine basically repeated his role as Kwai Chang Caine, this time with a mane of a haircut. The trademark ""i'll put you all to sleep"" voice stayed, though. Uma Thurman is beautiful and offers several touching moments. There are also several interesting details and, all in all, this is a watchable movie.I guess Tarantino did what he always wanted, he filmed a kung-fu movie.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
174,departed07,Quentin Tarantino's best since Pulp Fiction,10,26 August 2005,"The Bride is back and ready to kick ass in this conclusion to the two part series that Quentin Tarantino has establish as a masterpiece. Uma Thurman returns as the bride that everybody left for dead, until she got her revenge by killing two of the five assassins (Vivica A. Fox and Lucy Liu) and the crazy 88's; now she is after Bill (David Carradine), his lovely assistant Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and Bill's brother Budd (Michael Madsen in a larger role) and ready for her vengeance. What makes Kill Bill Vol.2 a better film than the original is not by the choreography action, but its dialog and getting to know the characters. During flashbacks with the Bride, we see her in training by Bill's former master, Pai Mai (Gordon Liu) in which he has not only taught Bill, but also his deadly one-eyed assassin for which it is explained how Elle lost her right eye. Pai hates Americans and thinks that women are lazy and futile; he trains and punishes The Bride, as he is proved wrong that there is a woman who can fight back. We also get a look back at the wedding in El Paso, Texas for which The Bride is pregnant and about to marry a hick who runs a local music shop and at the same time meets Bill for which we all know what happens next. The last scene between Bill and The Bride is a climatic scene for which I will never forget, as I was shocked to see how it ended. I'm sure you will feel the same way I do when you watch this film. Overall, this is Quentin Tarantino's best work since Pulp Fiction in which not only does the dialog take in effect, but also understanding the motives behind these characters makes it even better.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
175,andrewroy-04316,"Lighter on action than the first, Volume 2 drags through its attempts to provide emotional backstory, but leads up to a good climax",5,20 June 2019,"I found Kill Bill 1 to be a pure action movie completely lacking in personal interest, but so well done and energetic in the action set pieces to keep it enjoyable. Volume 2 is much lighter on action and tries to establish some emotional investment in the characters, but as that was the big weakness of Volume 1, it wasn't much better here. The first two acts (or the chapters before the final one) were quite a slog, as it was more seeing her past training and minor events, either before the wedding or with Bud. I don't think we really learn much about her character beyond what we knew of her as an intense killer from the first, until that final act. The fight between her and Elle is really well choreographed (though how could she just pluck her eye out? That just isn't how that works) and reminiscent of the action of 1. The final conversation with Bill is far and away the best part of the movie and what makes it watchable. Finally, we understand why Bill tried to kill her and why there is so much intensity in their relationship. It all fits into place clearly, and the conclusion in how he is killed is very fitting. There's a bit to ponder in redemption and one's reaction to shocking events, but it's still not a particularly deep movie, the ending just explains how it all happened. The good and satisfying but unexceptional ending certainly fails to make up for the boredom of the majority of the film. Kill Bill as a 4 hour movie is a passable action set piece and is classic Tarantino, but isn't anything I would ever recommend.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

177,bgar-80932,Better than the first,6,21 December 2018,The first Kill Bill was kinda non-sense KungFu crazy action. It had some cool ways to film it but I'm not a big Kung Fu fan so I didn't love it. This one focused a bit more on dialogue than the fighting and I enjoyed that more. The dialogue to me still wasn't near as good as the majority of Tarantino films so I still didn't love it but this was for sure better. This one had some cool interesting ways to film as well though and had some really cool scenes. It wrapped it up nicely and now I feel no need to ever watch these again.,Kill Bill - Vol. 2
178,danielmanson,The first is better,8,13 February 2021,"I've said it. The first film is better. It was fun watching both right after each other rather than having to wait a year when they were released.I'll start by saying that the performances in this was unreal. Like it's that good it blows you away and that's rare. So the question is. Why do I find the first better?There's 2 main reasons.
The first is the lack of action. I adored the fight scenes in the other film and the cinema work that went with it. This however had only really one fight scene, it focused a hell of a lot more on story. Which is fine, I just wished there was a little more of a kick to the film.
The second is the ending. And it just felt really anti-climatic. This is essentially a 4.5 hour film and although it ended how you'd probably like it to end, it was all just a little slow and anti-climatic. Again linking back to the other point, I wish it just had that added kick to it.Overall though I still really enjoyed it, hence the 8/10. It's a very interesting story partnered with incredible acting. I mean at the end of the day if you've seen the first instalment you need to watch this regardless of what people say. It would be like turning off a film midway! But yeah, it's a good sequel. Just not as good in my opinion.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
179,baileycrawly,An Improvement On the First,10,16 March 2020,"""Kill Bill"" really needs to be viewed as a single theatrical entity. It was written as one long film. It was filmed as one long film. And, despite the split into two being appropriate from the terms of a theatrical standpoint, it's best viewed as one long film when being viewed in the home video market.
I loved the first volume of Kill Bill. It was a violent bloodbath and I loved every single second of it. Volume 2 improves upon the original, something I wouldn't have believed even possible. It speaks to the quality work of Quentin Tarantino, that he knows how to tell a story and he can keep his audience enthralled and unable to look away from the screen for hours on end.
This film is a lot lighter on the ""action"" than it is on the story, which is perfectly fine because Tarantino's story suffices nicely. Much like the predecessor, this film doesn't waste time, and there's never any point in the film that feels like it's filler. Everything flows well at the hands of a master storyteller who, more than perhaps anybody else in the business, knows exactly what he's doing.
Uma Thurman once again plays an absolute badass in the role, every bit as much as the first volume.
It felt like this volume had a little bit more of a focus than the first volume in the sense that it's a cat-and-mouse chase to narrow down the ""Death List"" until, ultimately, the title of the movie is achieved.
The only major criticism of note for this part would be that the ending wasn't as epic as it potentially could've been, but it's still a fantastic story so it's easy to overlook that minor personal criticism.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
180,dfle3,Playful and with even more outrageous and preposterous action. 77.5%,8,26 January 2016,"Tarantino seems to be in an even more playful mood with ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" than he was in the first one, after opening his sequel with a replay of the dying bride sequence of ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"". For instance, The Bride narrates straight to the camera and at the audience. She even ups the ante with comments like: ""What the movie advertisements refer to as 'a roaring rampage of revenge'"". Is she talking about the movie ""Kill Bill""? or merely likening her situation to that of such movies in general? Such playfulness seems to me to take the edge off some of the disturbing imagery in this movie...like the kinds of horrors that you only see in cartoons...the kind that is parodied in The Simpson's cartoon within a cartoon ""The Itchy and Scratchy show"". Such horrors are rendered dreamlike or, more accurately, perhaps, like a daydream or fantasy. Where to draw the line between what is in real in the movie and what is fake becomes more fraught when The Bride makes the viewer an accomplice to her ""roaring rampage"" by saying ""the one I'm driving to right now, the only one I have left"". Again, this seems to erase the line between film and reality...movies don't talk back to you, do they? It's the film purporting to be real...you are there, with The Bride...sitting on the bonnet of her car...as she drives along a highway to mete out her next act of revenge!The other notable thing about this movie, going on my notes, are the inside jokes. For instance, Tarantino had me going with the books one of his characters was reading, i.e. ""The Carrucan's of Kurrajong"". Like me, Tarantino has a mistaken apostrophe. Anyway, I looked up this book just now and learned its provenance. The books just sounds like a real book...I'm pretty sure that there would be an Australian book with a not dissimilar title!Self-referential humour also plays a part in this film. For instance, Bill has a brand of bread called ""Blanco Bimbo"". The Bride is sometimes addressed as ""kiddo"" too...which has a payoff later in the film.Watching the movie and the end credits, Tarantino seems to be providing the viewer with a syllabus to follow-up on: two characters watch ""Shogun assassin"" together, for instance. A Charles Bronson movie poster adorns one character's caravan, I think. Not sure if it's this movie or the first one (perhaps both?) which also gives a nod to Charles Bronson in the end credits. Some nostalgia was brought up for me too...I'd forgotten that the cartoon series ""Heckle and Jeckle"" existed, but Tarantino reminded me!For those who enjoy Tarantino's pop cultural riffs, he has a good one concerning superheroes and their alter-egos.Some notes to self:* Bill says ""Ah so"" a couple of times in the film, I think...not sure if that is a nod to David Carradine's starring role in ""Kung fu"" many decades ago.* The pianist at the church is described as a ""drell""...I've only heard that word with relation to a character in the sci-fi game ""Mass Effect 2"", the word ""bar-kay"" is also used. Not sure what they mean here! Just looked up the latter phrase...the pianist was in a real life band of that name? Hmm...see my point earlier about blurring the line between fiction and reality!* Bill makes a comment to the effect that B wears the costume of Arlene...and...I shouldn't have used an abbreviation in my notes! Not sure who the ""B"" refers too...probably The Bride...and I'm guessing that ""Arlene"" was a fake name she used at her wedding rehearsal.As with the first movie, from memory, I was toying with what score to give this movie...I think scoring this sequel 75% was on the cards but I liked how it played out, so I settled on a higher score so that I'd give it 8 out of 10, since this site doesn't give half stars.Lastly, if you like playful movies like this, I'd also recommend the horror movie ""In the mouth of madness"" and the sci-fi movie ""The thirteenth floor"".",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
181,iohefy-2,WHAT A VIOLENT MESS,2,13 April 2004,"I did not see Kill Bill # 1 and after to seeing Kill Bill Volume 2 I am glad that I did not. The story was far fetched and very violent.  The only thing I can say for Uma Thurman is that she had to be in pretty good physical shape to perform all the junk she did in the movie. I don't know what todays audience thinks is entertainment, but this certainly was not on that list.  I guess that there will be fans that will go see anything that is up on the screen, but in my humble opinion I would not go see another Tarantino movie because I think that he is way overrated.  My opinion is skip this one, in a lineup of poor movies.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
182,Al_The_Strange,"""When I arrive at my destination, I am gonna kill Bill.""",9,12 July 2014,"Quentin Tarantino channels the manic, ultraviolent, stylized energy of cheesy kung-fu cinema, American westerns, and a slight twist of Italian horror, and he uses it all like threads to weave one of the greatest revenge stories ever made. Both Kill Bill movies collectively form a coherent, cohesive, sublime storytelling package; ideally, they should be watched back-to-back to understand every nuance of the story and the characters, since there is so much depth to them.Volume 2 of this saga fills in the gaps that its predecessor left behind, not only in following up on the rest of the Bride's rampage, but also in revealing her full back story. But while Volume 1 had tons of rip-roaring action and an extremely vivid style, this follow-up is much more toned-down and mellow, laden with more dialogue than swordplay. In a way, this falls more in line with Tarantino's other work, but I personally favor the first film more for being sublimely entertaining. As it is, Volume 2 tends to be a bit long-winded and dry.That being said, it still has a lot of brilliant moments that are worth seeing, including the burial scene, the fight between the Bride and Elle Driver, the brutal training scenes with Pai Mei, and the last half-hour or so, which builds up to a beautiful bittersweet ending.For the most part, it's the story that counts, and it excels at taking characters we already know and love, and taking them to the next level. The full reasons for both sides of the conflict are finally revealed, generating empathy for both Bill and the Bride. Any other movie would be content in leaving things as a plain, straightforward black-and-white affair, but in this case, there's much more insight to the characters and the overall plot. It all builds up to the inevitable climax, which pulls out one of the most heart-wrenching twists imaginable. Through it all, the film provides the most satisfying ending possible, and it makes the entire Kill Bill saga one of the most endearing and complete storytelling experiences made.This film is crafted with superb photography and plenty of flashy editing. A few title cards, flashbacks, and asides are thrown into the mix for a stylized effect. Acting continues to impress: Uma Thurman is effectively perfect in her role, and it's especially notable how physically demanding her role must have been. David Carradine exhibits an interesting presence as Bill, while Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah excel at being villains we love to hate. Writing is very sharp and interesting. This production boasts some good-looking sets, props, costumes, and locales. Music is pretty good at times, though I enjoy the music choices of Volume 1 better.While Volume 1 excels at the action and style but comes up a little shorter on substance, Volume 2 is the opposite, subduing the action to favor the dialogue and storytelling. Some people may like one over the other. I personally prefer Volume 1, but this sequel is essential for the complete experience, and it adds up to a satisfying saga. If you can handle the violent bits, the whole affair is highly recommended.4.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Perfect | Film: Very Good)",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
183,Angeneer,Quentin made me eat my hat,10,8 September 2005,"I'm very happy to admit that Tarantino proved me wrong. If you read my review of Vol.1 you'll see that I was very disappointed with the apparent lack of coherent plot and cinematic innovations. Vol.2 is so breathtakingly good that makes up for the sub-par (for Quentin's standards of course) Vol.1 and not only that, it makes you look back at the first installment with a much more appreciative eye. Vol.2 has a great plot and solid character building, blended with the unique Tarantino style. So Quentin has definitely not run dry of ideas, on the contrary he's become even more subtle and mature.I also have to save some praise for the captivating performances of David Carradine and Uma Thurman. It is unbelievable how perfectly they fit their roles, as if they were made for them! In terms of comparison between 1 & 2, here's how I see it: Vol.1 on its own is a mediocrity, Vol.2 on its own is a fantastic movie, Vol.1 & 2 together are a monumental saga.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
184,bsinc,Now that's more like it,8,12 September 2004,"I frankly didn't like ""Vol.1"" that much because it border lined on an average, although banal script and because of the amount of overdoing it with those chopped hands and feet in the end. But ""Vol. 2"" is sooooo much better. Gone is the uncomfortable and unconvincing feeling of watching a Tarantino movie (because let's face the truth - that's what it is and that's why we're there watching it) and in come those magnificent (Oscar worthy even) monologues and the true feeling of spoofing old Asian martial arts movies. Also the antagonist characters are much much more interesting and believable to watch. But most important of all, the humor is back on track and the acting is all together quite excellent. David Carradine's character of Bill would make every girl's panties wet in a flash in real life because everything he says sounds just so unbelievably interesting and true. I'd want to go and fight him in that beautiful moonlight down on that sandy beach because his gentle words were that convincing. Amazing job quite frankly. Michael Parks as Esteban Vihaio is another great example of a supporting role, as well as comedic talent. His lines are drop dead funny.So the comparison to ""Vol. 1"" is quite unnecessary. The first one simply laid the tracks, even if in a rather mediocre way. The second one has everything else. Truly brilliant monologues (Superman's perception on humanity being my favorite), great sense of humor, quite astonishing performances (Uma plays the part with style) and loads of fun.8/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
185,domino1003,A Great Finish To A Great Movie! (SPOILERS!!!),9,12 August 2004,"""Kill Bill, Vol. 2,"" is a great movie. I expected it to fall flat, since ""Vol. 1"" has pretty much all the violence and blood. Instead, we are given a character study of those that remain: We find out why Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah, managing to be beautiful and wicked at the same time)has lost her eye, the REAL story behind the massacre that sent The Bride (Uma Thurman, kicking much butt, yet showing a softer side.)on her quest, the depth of Bill's (David Carradine)feelings toward her, and the real name of The Bride.Carradine comes off as Caine(From ""Kung Fu""), falling into the dark side. In the first movie, Bill was voice and shadows, but in the film, once you get to know him, you kind of understand why he did what he did (That doesn't condone what he's done, mind you), and the regret that he has felt ever since.Two questions have popped up, though:1) The bitterness between Bill and Budd. They had a falling out years before. Was it in regard to The Bride? It's never discussed.2) Elle Driver. Is she dead? There is a possibility, seeing that there's a deadly snake in the trailer, that she may be dead. But you don't know. Maybe she'll pop up in a sequel, if they ever do one.One other thing...How did the Bride choose Tommy? You never really find out much about how they hooked up or his feelings about having another man's child. It would have been interesting if it would have been explored more.Otherwise, it was a great way to end a movie.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
186,socrates99,Anyone placing this film out of the all-time top 10 doesn't love film,10,6 January 2007,"I just watched this film again after having seen it when it first came out and I am awe-struck: I have never seen a film equal itself in spell-binding impact as thoroughly the second time around as 'Kill Bill'. Spielberg and Ridley Scott are two other formidable filmmakers capable of that, to mention a few, but for sheer entertainment value, I think Tarantino clearly outdoes them both. Earlier today at the gym I was watching the death of Go Go in 'Kill Bill: Volume I' and all the way home I was smiling ear to ear. There's no way I was going to miss 'Kill Bill: Volume II'.The thing about Tarantino's masterpiece is that he is dead on in the emotional aspects of the story. The current of feeling is so strong that my wife has to turn away in certain spots. What I can't understand is how is it every actor in this movie was aware of its quality while it was being shot? Somehow every performance is so unbelievably compelling it's quite difficult to judge who did the best job.It's impossible to praise one without wanting to praise them all, but I will say that I thought Uma was a bad choice when I first heard she had the lead. She just seemed too lightweight physically. But rather than spoil the movie, in many ways, she is its best part, which is saying a great deal in this case. Like all great actresses, she essentially makes you fall in love with her. Quite a trick considering she does this by overcoming a substantial barrier of space and time. Could there be a sequel? I wouldn't think it possible except this is Quentin Tarantino.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
187,diac228,Review of Kill Bill Vol. 1 and 2,10,28 October 2005,"One of the most acclaimed movies this decade is Kill Bill, Volumes 1 and 2. Both movies made over 60 million dollars each in the United States (over 330 million dollars worldwide in total) and has gotten so much praise one would wonder why is it that this doesn't have its own star in the Hollywood Walk of Fame yet. Directed by the unique and creative Quentin Tarantino, Kill Bill mixes bloody gory violence with a lot of beautiful imagery, excellent music, and a well-rounded cast of zany characters. Sounds great doesn't it? Well, Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a very good movie, but it is not as good as people say it is. As for Kill Bill Volume 2, now that is a spectacular movie. These two movies in actuality is one film, but for marketing purposes and because the finished product is so long, Miramax decides to release it as two separate films. Despite the rather slow start, Kill Bill finishes so strong you know why Tarantino is as popular as he is today.Kill Bill is about a woman, whose name is not revealed throughout most of the film (known as The Bride), looking for revenge after the gang of assassins she used to be with attacked her during a wedding rehearsal, killing every single person except for her. But before she goes after the man that started the massacre, she wants to get rid of the four people that were involved in the bloodbath first. Much easier said than done. The first Kill Bill basically is like an action flick, not concentrated too heavily on plot, but more on action. Kill Bill Vol. 2 does contain its amount of intense action, but also sinks deeper into the personalities of not just The Bride, but of the assassins, and Bill himself.The first part of Kill Bill is advertised as a massive action flick full of intense sequences of sword fighting and action. The truth is, there is only two massive action scenes, and both are good, don't get me wrong, but there is a lot of fluff in between the two action scenes. They range from several scenes of chatter, to an anime sequence, to a long sequence of The Bride trying to wiggle her toes. Talk about slow-paced. To add to that, it took 10-20 minutes before the final fight was finally set up. In other words, she was at the scene of the major fight, yet it took forever for the fight to begin. This first part of the movie would be much shorter if it was Robert Rodriguez editing the film.Tarantino also does this one-take shot that just can turn a potentially short moment into a very stretched and prolonged scene. And this happens twice. The movie is good, there is a good storyline, two jaw-dropping action scenes, good cast of characters(I fell in love with Gogo Yubari, and also the top assassin Elle Driver) and a shocking twist in the end, but overall I find Kill Bill Vol. 1 rather overrated. If there is one thing I love about the first part though, it has got to be the music, especially the credits theme and also the now famous theme to the hotel where the final battle takes place. Now enter part 2.Kill Bill Vol. 2 is everything Vol. 1 wanted to be. Volume 2 perfectly mixes suspense with action, humor, excellent music, brilliant acting, and a very good ending. Volume 2 basically fills all the holes Volume 1 created, and also answers all of the questions as to why the events took place and how The Bride became so skillful. Volume 2 concludes the entire ordeal, as the Bride has to deal with Budd, Elle, and of course, Bill, but gets a little more than what she bargained for. Elle Driver makes an even longer appearance the second time around, and Daryl Hannah (well-known as the mermaid in Splash) gives the best performance of the movie, as she portrays the ruthless, clever, unpredictable, and rage-filled rival assassin of The Bride. Her battle against the Bride stands in my opinion as one of the best fights within the past 10 years.The second half of the movie also has several flashbacks that helps weave the story together, and the flashback themselves were very entertaining and offered its share of foreshadowing. This was the pure filming brilliance that I was expecting from Tarantino. Very few flaws in the movie, and there never was a sense that the movie was dragging too long, and it is clocked in at over 10 minutes longer than the original, but it did not feel that way. There is not much more to say about the second part, except for the fact that it really picked up the slack and delivers one of the best movie experiences this decade. Kill Bill overall is a great film, overrated, but a superb film nonetheless. Not the best I have seen this decade, but has an entertainment value that is much higher than the usual films within the past few years.

188,supertom-3,"Great film, b-movie and chop-socky lovers will go crazy for it!",9,9 June 2004,"This is a great and satisfying conclusion to Tarantino's spaghetti western kung-fu, B-movie extravaganza. The film continues where we left Uma, having killed off Lucy Liu and Vivaca Fox. Now she has Michael Madsen, Darryl Hannah and David Carridine left to obliterate.Much like the last episode this is super cool and very violent. Tarantino takes great delight in referencing the genres he loves and referencing movies in this from Drunken Master to Blade Runner. The 2nd part is far less visceral and less action packed, giving us more story concerning the Bride and we also get more insight into Bill. This installment really has something going for it with the more central appearances for both Madsen and Carradine as Bill. Madsen is excellent and once again Tarantino gets the best from him. This is a great role for him as Budd. Budd initially seems like a beaten down, shell of a man who has no inspiration left in him and in many ways regrets what he did to the Bride. He seems as if he will just kneel before this angel of death and take his punishment, that is until he gets a taste for the kill again and finds he can enjoy torturing her, he becomes invigorated by violence. Carradine rocks as Bill. This is the best thing I have seen from him, he is excellent here. Carradine rules the film when he is on screen. Darryl Hannah has rarely been as good in a role that really pushes and kicks the ass of the image of the cutesy and loveable girl next door she was most famous for in the 80's. Uma Thurman is once again brilliant, sexy, and tough. This part really allows her to stretch as an actress and episode 2 gives the depth to the character to move the Bride to the next level from the first part. I am not the only one who feels that Thurman should get an Oscar nomination for her part in Kill Bill 2.This is a satisfying conclusion to a great and refreshing story. I can't wait to watch them together as a whole. ****1/2",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
189,charchuk,Story drags it down,8,26 March 2007,"It's definitely the more story-oriented of the two, and that might hurt it. Since volume one is all action, all of the plot and character development is left to this part, which makes it a bit too long and talky. That's not to say the dialogue isn't good, because it is, but parts of this film - especially near the end - drag on a lot longer than they need to. The climax takes forever, and then it is somewhat anti-climatic, though the final act of revenge was fitting. The action is sparse but awesome, and the acting is significantly better - probably because David Carradine's actually in this one - but it is slightly worse than the first volume. Although, Pai Mei is my favourite character in the set, so I have to give it props for that.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
190,EthanBJones_03,Recommend purely to finish the saga,6,19 September 2017,"'KILL BILL: VOLUME 2' - 2004Directed by Quentin TarantinoStarring Uma Thurman and David CarradinePlot Overview: ​*CONTINUED AFTER EVENTS OF KILL BILL: VOL 1* After defeating 2/5 of her targets, The Bride(Uma Thurman) continues to wage her one woman war against those who wronged her. And she still takes no prisoners!it's certainly different but I disagree that that makes it better. My issue with this film is the difference in tone and style. I adored Volume One for its masterful visuals, great action and fun story. This film is on the opposite end of the spectrum in genre. It's a more grounded, story driven conclusion to Tarantino's original saga. And I wouldn't be bothered if the two films were so different. If Tarantino did an entirely separate, story driven and grounded story; then I'd be down with it. I would. But the fact that the first film was an excellent action film and this isn't annoys me greatly and the disconcert between the two is stupid. Pick a style and stick with it. I personally don't think that this is the better half of the saga, not even close. Don't tell me that I am just a blood thirsty, action junkie who cannot enjoy dramatic stories. I am not. I love drama as a genre but I hate how Tarantino has tried to mesh the two into this saga. If you like it, then that is fine but it really did not work for me.The carry over story is still really good. The through lines remain and I was still thoroughly engaged in the story-line. It includes some really incredible and gut wrenching scenes which were the highlight of the film. I really admired that and one scene in this movie makes me actively dislike the ending scene of the last movie(not action scene but emotional scene). The film finishes the story well enough but I do not think it recaptured the magic of the original. Uma Thurman was excellent in this movie and maintains the highlight of this saga. We also learn a lot more about her character in this film which I thought was a genius idea. There is one specific piece of information I wish was left ambiguous about her that they revealed. It doesn't affect quality in any way but I think it would add a lot to the mystique of her character if we weren't told this piece of information.David Carradine was great as Bill. Bill was strange. I THINK I liked him as an antagonist but I cannot be too sure. He hit all the right cues and was threatening enough but I can't be certain in whether he's an excellent villain, or an average one. He's in that little grey area.Daryl Hannah was appropriately loathsome as Elle Driver. She did a good job and the actual character was a pretty decent one. She was a good minor antagonist.Technically wise, it is still a very nice looking movie and I do still appreciate Tarantino's masterful style. That said, I do think that the novelty of seeing his style in Volume One does wear of in this film. Not that that retracts quality, it just makes it harder to praise when it doesn't feel as fresh and invigorating. The use of black and white was also very nice but it did occasionally come of as abrupt and strange.The score for these films is incredible. The soundtrack is excellent and I cannot commend the composers and Tarantino himself for assembling such an awesome array of music and sound effects.As far as action goes, I was underwhelmed in this movie. I had doubts that they could outdo the Crazy 88s but I still had hope. They. Did. Not. There is ONE action scene in this film and it was fine. It wasn't too memorable but it was certainly entertaining. None of the action is mediocre it just isn't great when compared to the original, which I am inclined to do because A] It's a direct continuation and B] I can.​ I really wanted to like this movie but I was thoroughly disappointed. The first one was such a fun, inventive, stylised movie that I could barely poke flaws in. This tries desperately to ride of Volume One's steam and ultimately fails. I only, and I mean only recommend you see this film to see how the story ties up. Aside from that, it was a very bland and forgettable experience. I'll rate this movie 6 'Beard Strokes' out of 10.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
191,Marc_Israel_365,Mythology revealed,8,30 April 2013,"The characters are interesting, always though retro development, and the action virtually non-stop. The best explanation of anything was saved for the end in David Carridines' superhero mythology speech. Vivaca Fox, Lucy Liu, Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen play out their parts, but it is a mocking Chia Hui Liu who puts on the performance that you'll remember for some time. I love how the whip sound effect is played every time he flips his long thin white beard and mustache! In KB-I, I wanted (and got) the Tarantino experience, while I was more interested in getting answers in KB-II.

192,Marc_Israel_365,Kung Fu spaghetti western spun in dirty web of mythology,8,31 December 2017,"There's a quote by the character Budd in this Quentin Tarantino movie after our now Bouncer is asked to compare his Hatori Honzo sword with others. It is at this time that he hesitates and comments on appropriate and inappropriate comparisons. I would venture that the same goes true for QT movies. As they are genre compilations with their own set of rules of the film realm, that we have come to love and trust, they really stand in their own place. We picked up here where we left off with The Brides' Viper Assassin Gang Assassination List 40% complete, with another 88 or so Samarai style deaths absolved along the way in the name of avenging the loss of her baby four years earlier. If we were expecting more of the same we would have been selling QT short. Enter The Western!It's a dirty, dusty old trail of revenge and nothing is going stop her, except herself... see beginning and ending off the movie for further details. This is countered by overacting, which is purposefully delicious and appropriate. To compare KBII to KB I is miss the point of a continued move. This really isn't a ""II"" , in the movie sense of franchised adventure. Volume 2 is simply the second half of a movie that was split in two for purposes of audience attention span, studio double dipping into your pockets and, I'm guessing, a bit off QT tom foolery.... and isn't that what we came for?",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
193,kdnor2011,"Liked it more than the first, but still didn't love it.",7,9 December 2010,"Yes I am aware that these two films were originally supposed to be one film, but got split up. That still makes Vol. 2 a sequel, and it's one of those sequels that is better than the first.I liked the first Kill Bill, it was entertaining, thrilling, graphic, gory, and there were no gigantic plot holes, at least none that I saw. But it just wasn't my kind of movie, and this one kind of falls under the same category. With that said, I still like this movie more than the first.The movie follows the Bride, who has already knocked two people off her death list, with only 3 more to go. She tracks them down, kills, or blinds, one of them, after she already killed the fourth. So know she off to destroy the main man, Bill. But when she gets there, she meets someone that makes it much harder for the bride.Kill bill volume 2 is a good movie, and one I will probably watch again sometime in the future, along with the first one.

The martial arts fighting - absolutely essential to this genre' - I found to be believable (I know no martial arts - I'm just saying I was convinced the fighting was real). (Many times - MANY - times in scifi's the science is so loonie that there is no point in watching. Science is to scifi's as authentic looking fighting is to a Tarantino movie. However, the acting was unconvincing. I saw Ulma Thurman and knew it was her the whole time - same for the other actors. 8 out of 10....sans Michael Parks as 'Estabon' - I was mesmerized by this Spanish gentleman of leisure who scared me in my chair. I was scared - he was so calm and pleasant and yet there was a cauldron of aggression just sitting tranquilly waiting to be disturbed so it could explode (""esplode"" as Estaban might say it) on another helpless human... Estabon scared me... THEN I saw the credits and thought to myself: ""It was Michael Parks?!?"" He should win an Oscar for best actor! (I was amazed even more when the western style sheriff who investigates the Pine Church massacre in KB:V.1 turns out to be Parks as well.) Now if that range and depth of acting doesn't win an award... then the academy needs to reevaluate its assessment technique. Parks was brilliant! He was so good I thought that this guy is too real - he is too scary - he has got to be caste from off the street! Michael Parks gets a 20 out of 10; 4 thumbs up; A+++; major plus superlative kudos.

But before we see the rest of the vengeance to take place, we are taken back to the massacre at the Two Pine Chapel. The Bride and her husband Tommy are rehearsing their ceremony when a surprise visitor comes; Bill, setting this vengeance story into motion. Now come back to the rest of her Death List Five, next to come is Budd. Living in a camper van and working in a strip club, Budd is very unhappy with his life. When Bill gives him news that The Bride is out to get him, Budd couldn't care less. Entangled with Budd's fate is Elle, who despises The Bride; who in return The Bride didn't like much either, setting up for one down dirty grudge fight; an ultimate cat fight with very sharp claws. But the the highlight come to the dramatic conclusion when The Bride finally confronts Bill, but has a shocking revelation in store for her.Kill Bill Vol 2 is a spectacular conclusion to the masterpiece of Vol 1. Like Vol 1, Vol 2 is a patch work of movie influences and references. While Vol 1 was more in the realm of Japanese Samuria films, Vol 2 is set more in the Spagetti Westerns and Chinese Martial Art films. While Vol 1 has more action, Vol 2 has picked up more of the Tarantino Dioluge, adding more weight to the story, as we do finally see a lot of the background to The Bride and Bill. Though it doesn't suffer from the drop in action, as the dramatic tension is raised a lot; especially towards the end and the confrontation of Bill.The violence is very dulled down in Vol 2. The blood has been with drawn and there isn't much blood to see, but it still has that vulgarity from Vol 1 that still has that mesmerising effect. Being the main fight sequences, the grudge between Elle and The Bride is a fight to remember. It was a dirty slug fight that wasn't afraid to bring the low punches out, and there were some very low punches from each. Though the fight of Bill many have found abit underplayed and not what they were wanting, it was a very fitting end. The tension in the small fight was so gripping that it resolved it wonderfully.Uma Thurman out does herself from Vol 1. Her reaction to many situation were so believable; it was painful to see her face when she sees her daughter for the first time and when she was being buried alive that was also painful to watch hearing her crying. David Carradine does an excellent job as Bill. Though there were a few times it seemed he was talking to so for his dialog, kinda putting the emphasises out of place, yet it was a minor flaw in his role. Michael Madsen was great as the begrudged Budd, he showed a lot of hollowness in Budd, with Budd thinking it can be fixed with money. Daryl Hannah was just outstanding as Elle. She played a perfect bitch. She was a character you loved to hate. You could hear all the malevolence in her voice. Gordon Liu as Pai Mei was just perfect. You can't help but laugh with every whip of his beard he makes with his hand.Kill Bill Vol 2 is a wonderful conclusion to this tale of revenge. It would be great to see Vol 1 and 2 in one whole film.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

(2 more than the first), we are not a journey, forget only the abatements, come here the important is The development of the work, the development of it, except for our protagonist, is completely humanized and badly rememberable of the killer Which it is. Technically the film is much more restrained than the first in all respects, nothing blends cinematographic styles or guiding the film with songs, none of it, but very cool details, with the use of camera, open plans, zoom abuse In And zoom out, the closing of Sergio Leone, as well as its details, a montage of the film leaves a belly, in addition to being much slower in relation to the first, until a soundtrack plunges, because in the second, the Silence and contemplation pattern More the scene than the track itself. A cool thing in the second film is how performances, which gain a notorious quality leap with Michel Madsen and David Carradine, and even the entrepreneur Pai Mei played by Gordon Liu.

At the start, we witness why The Bride (Uma Thurman) is enacting revenge on five different people. After this we have a brief run-in with a conversation between Bill and his low-life brother, Bud. Within a half hour, The Bride and Bud meet. Bud succeeds in capturing her and buries her alive.While six feet under, we witness The Bride have a flashback of her training with the Japanese martial arts legend Pai Mei (Chia Hui Liu).

By this time The Bride is out of her grave and heading for Buds trailer. I'll leave it here so I don't ruin it.Uma Thurman portrays the Bride incredibly. Smart, bold, and powerful. Willing to do anything to reach her goal of Bill. Uma Thurman is one of your top actresses in America today. She is sheer brilliant as the Bride and will keep you asking for more with every scene.Kill Bill, although not as bloody, still holds the R rating due to some violence and heavy language. Even though the Bride is the main character, I did not find her to be the most interesting. Rather it is Michael Madsen's character Bud who seems the only one of the five murders to have emotion and regret for what he did.The movie is dominated by Tarantino effects and brilliant acting by Uma Thurman and David Carradine (Bill). 4 1/2 out of 5 Stars.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Since the first movie focused more on tributes to martial arts and Hong Kong motion pictures, the second movie focuses more on long scenes of dialouge between characters, and it's known for it's stylish directing from Quentin Tarantino. Thurman once again delivers another fine performance, reprising her role as ""the Bride"" from Vol.1. In Vol.2, she's more focused on trying to get out of sticky situations, to make sure that her enemies get what they deserve. Although Vol.1 was more enjoyable, Vol.2 helps bring everything to a close, with an ending that's better to be left unspoiled. But, there were some scenes that dragged off from it's place, and there were some times where I got uninterested. But overall, this is an expertly made homage that only Tarantino can make. In his short scenes, the late great David Carradine delivers a beautiful performance as Bill. You see him as a nice man on the outside, at first, but you can easily tell that he's a monster on the inside. It's a real damn shame that David Carradine passed away, years after the first two movies were released. These movies really showed what a superstar he really was. Although the first volume of the story was my favorite of the two movies, Volume 2 doesn't disappoint. This is a well-made, and somewhat enjoyable that deserves all the praise necessary.

199,tankace,Less killing than the first but still nice.,8,4 July 2016,"Kill Bill Volume 2 follows the Bride to its last target of her death list and although this movie lacks the killing spree of the first its dialogue and performance are great and we also learn here about her back story, why the Assassin Viper Squad tried to kill her and her relationship with Bill (it was more intimate than I though).In general the movie close all the lose ends than the previous had left as well as giving us with a good way the identity of the Bride ,which was a secret during the Volume 1. So when the movie ends the story is practically 100% finished and I believe that Tarantino tried to do just that, made a two part movie,now the why I don't have any idea, but as the third movie in a franchise is usually the worst and some times destroys the story of the previous two, see for instance Spiderman 3, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines Matrix Revolution and X-men the Last Stand, I think he made a good choice. In the Volume 1 the love of Quentine for the Japanese culture and the samurai sword was obvious ,for Christ sake about 65% of the movie takes place in Japan! In this one we see his love for the martial ,but we also have some nit picks of western ,like a sunrise and some more (No spoilers!). I generally like the on equal measure this two flicks, for are really cool and tell a story ark of an kick ass female assassin ,which isn't the norm as we have see in leads role women in a handful of action films, like the Alien and Aliens, Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgement Day and Mad Max: Fury Road. In summary for the girls ,who want to show to men that they can be lethal, you can add and the two Volumes in your collection.In short is a really good Tarantino film as it is usual with is director ,who is among the greatest of the last two decades.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

201,squeezebox,Marginally Better than Vol. 1,5,18 March 2005,"The only reason KILL BILL VOL 2 is superior to VOL 1 is because both David Carradine and Daryl Hannah have more screen time, which helps to balance the awfulness of Uma Thurman's performance.We also get the cool sequence in which Thurman undergoes her training with the master swordsman, which is shot like a gritty seventies Shaw Bros. kung fu flick. The entire sequence, however, winds up serving little more purpose than to explain how she gets out of her impossible situation of being buried alive at the hands of grunt Michael Madsen (playing a more down and out version of the same character he always plays).Her ability in punching through a plank of wood from a short distance comes in handy when she has to punch through the coffin lid. Of course, this doesn't explain how she's able to punch through the ton of dirt that's been piled on top of it.Hannah shines in her best role in years as the ruthless one-eyed assassin who kills Madsen for giving Thurman such an unceremonious death, despite the fact that she herself was all ready to kill her in her sleep not long before that. She also comes to a grotesque demise, which, unfortunately is made far less shocking by an unnecessary foreshadowing in the previous movie.But the real shining light in VOL 2 is David Carradine. His presence is electrifying, and he carries the movie single handedly for the much of its running time. Unfortunately, he is forced to interact with Thurman during the final few scenes, with her bugging eyes and stilted delivery snuffing much of the life out of their exchanges.These scenes are supposed to be emotionally devastating, but simply don't ring true at all, because Thurman isn't the least bit believable. She screams and cries and wails, but it's all so phony it has no effect.The movie is worth sitting through for Hannah and Carrdine. Tarantino's direction is obvious and by the numbers, for the most part. The two movies together are a major disappointment from a filmmaker who's capable of delivering far better material.Oh, by the way, ""Q and U"" stands for Quentin Tarantino and Uma Thurman.

⚪
All in all, the inevitable second volume of a gruesome gorefest is unable to hold a candle to its pretentious predecessor and ends up as a forgettable and utterly disappointing end to a revenge story that started out so outstandingly. As crazy as it sounds, this was a first time watch for me, even if I had seen the first one already in the past. From a today's point of view, I am glad that I haven't seen it back in the day, because then I wouldn't have watched it one more time. I have so many questions about this film and one stands out to the others: What in the actual hell happened here? The first one is a ruthless piece of revenge extravaganza that takes no prisoners and is a fast-paced mix of eastern and western cinema. And this one? None of it. It feels like a totally different and lazy movie the director didn't put much effort into, almost as if he didn't know to wrap up his original masterpiece properly. The quick action sequences that made the first volume so bloody gorgeous made way for overlong, fatiguing scenes of dialogue. Seriously, there is just too much of people speaking to each other and nothing that resembles the first outing. I have no objection towards films like this, but in the most cases those are dramas. When a film bears literally the same title as one of the most brutal vengeance thrillers of all time, I want exactly that - and nothing that seemingly wants to be in a competition with ""Mr. Smith Goes To Washington"". And its not even the dialogue in the first place that bored me so immensely. Every character seems to be a philosopher, and hence every conversation is hilariously metaphorical and utterly pointless and stupid for the plot. When Bill, who appears to be a little more educated than the others, lectures about goldfishes and superheroes it is cool, but doesn't contribute anything important to the plot and rather stretches it to a painful degree. And when his brother Budd talks in the same manner, it doesn't fit his character in the slightest and makes it indescribably unrealistic. And have I mentioned that it is pointless? More than the first hour passes by and offers nothing but this. Quick pace? Nothing doing! And when something is happening it is nothing but the lengthy backstory of the bride and how she learned to fight from a master that couldn't be any more of a caricature. In terms of fighting, there isn't even much. There are only two or three scenes I would consider as real combat, and when they occurred, they were over in the matter of seconds. Why, Tarantino? The style is gone, the desire of revenges is gone, the hate of the bride seems to be gone. What remains? A few hours of characters acting totally different and chatting as if they originally didn't want to kill each other. Do you remember your list, Kiddo? One target didn't even die by hour hand and you only injured the other without making sure she would die. Where did the conviction go? Were you so much invested in acting what can best be described as a wannabe drama about motherhood? I am so disappointed, because when she finally did what the title promises, it happened in the most anticlimactic manner possible. No fight, no epic choreography. Nothing at all! Oh, and have I mentioned how ridiculously unrealistic it is general? I mean, when someone shoots me in the chest with a shotgun at close range, ties me up and buries me alive six feet deep, I am definitely unable to make it out alive? The Bride? Easy-peasy. This whole film totally lost its track and suffers from severe tonal confusion. That is it. In the end, it is a painfully boring, indescribably unsatisfactory and unexciting mess of an ending. Calling it a disappointment would be an understatement. I mean, just compare it to the first film: There are worlds between those two. Once again, I have watched a critically praised film by Tarantino and cannot understand why it is so loved. I just don't get it, seriously. In terms of cinematography it is undeniably top-notch, but as a film as a whole? A let down that doesn't resemble the masterpiece the first was in the slightest. It is a no from me, and definitely something that is not worth re-waching. I despise it when films I hope to be great end up as the complete opposite. This is exactly the case here.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Of The First Movie, But Wraps The Story Up Great.",7,12 August 2014,"From the beginning, this sequel (Maybe) has impossible odds of surpassing such an impressive first movie, and overall wrapping up the story of The Bride's quest. Whereas not as good as the first one, ""Kill Bill Volume: 2"" has enough shining moments to keep the story going, and also reveals the characters origins thanks to that non-chronological story telling.Uma Thurman is still as deadly as ever. Her quest continues as she goes after Bill's brother Budd (Michael Madsen), who remains in contact with other ""Deadly Viper Squad"" member Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah). All of which culminates with ""The Bride"" finding Bill, and a surprise revelation.Martial Arts master Pai Mei, played by Gordon Liu is probably the best new character introduced in ""Volume. 2"". Both his & The Bride's scenes together are the movies highlight. Other than that, it's without doubt that this movie contains more dialogue heavy scenes than action. It becomes clear that when the production was coming together, Tarantino put all his best material into ""Volume: 1"". Saying that, there's nothing seriously wrong with ""Volume: 2"", and there are a few deleted scenes I wish made it into the final cut.

206,bix171,Rich And Meaty,10,22 July 2004,"Perhaps it was Quentin Tarentino's intention all along to present `Kill Bill' in two parts--how else can you explain the elaborate correction he performs on the first film's know-it-all attitude towards women? Where `Volume One' seemed to want to explain and ultimately dismiss women, `Volume Two' finds Tarentino in awe of them, especially his heroine `The Bride' (Uma Thurman), who, by the film's conclusion, has ascended to the throne that the director holds dearest: motherhood. It's an arduous path to that throne, going, as she does, from `natural-born killer' to loving parent but the respect that Tarentino gives the female mystique is as sincere and reverent as the respect he gives his cinematic and literary sources and it's part of what makes this film a masterpiece. The second volume is meatier than the first, with far more attention paid to the story and the richness of the relationship between `The Bride' and Bill (David Carradine, a perfect performance) which alternates between father-daughter, mentor-pupil and husband-wife. (Early scenes between them feature stunning close-ups bathed in warm sepia backlight and the chemistry is intuitive, palpable and instructive.). It's also somewhat less insistent on its revenge motif (though the battle between `The Bride' and Daryl Hannah's Elle Driver and its denouement is both films' high point). But the director turns up the psychological assault a notch and his ability to manipulate and terrify his audience is on a par with Hitchcock's. (Thurman's living burial is intense and agonizing.) As a filmmaker, Tarentino shows a remarkable mastery of his medium, employing, as he does, techniques that establish him as a scholar and not an imposter--the single-take reverse crane shot that frames the massacre in El Paso where the story has its' center is worthy of Ford and Peckinpah--and it confirms he's a true auteur who walks the walk: by culling from so many sources he's created a distinctive style that seems fresh and honest. He's also the only one who can execute it.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
207,jmbwithcats,Better then vol 1 but still disappointing,6,19 April 2004,"Yes, I found this movie ended as a complete rip off to the Jet Li film Kiss of the Dragon, and that was disappointing to me, in the film's defense, I was glad the movie was a more traditional martial arts film then vol1, Carradeine, and Thurman were incredible, and the movie was watchable and oftentimes, enjoyable.  Vol 1 was a pen and ink drawing with little detail just outlining Vol 2 was made to color it in and add some detail... I think they accomplished this very well. Overall a good film.  I loved Samuel Jackson as the wedding organist :)",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

209,brenttraft,Not For Outsiders,4,17 April 2004,"People who buy into Tarantino's world of cartoon violence are going to love this film but for anyone else it will be tedious and dull.Really, the only thing good I can say about this film is that it is visually well done.  It is a shame that such a talented film maker does not have the courage to try to make a serious film or at least something different than his previous films and instead keeps making the same movie over and over. With the plethora of comic book and video game based movies that come out on a weekly basis, ""Kill Bill"" is redundant.Also, I did not laugh at any of the ""clever-one-liners"" that Tarantino's fans are so impressed with.  I've heard better in other movies.Overall, Tarantino fans will love it because it is just like all his other films.  Everyone else should skip it.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
210,Donatien3,Satisifying.,8,28 April 2004,"When 'Kill Bill Vol. I' finished last year; the anxious wait for the conclusion of Tarantino's revenge saga began.Would The Bride get her revenge?Would she be re-united with her daughter?How many more people would she dismember?Well, the sequel is here, and the result is good.Very Good.It's probably not as fun as Volume I (with its so-over-the-top-it's-almost-funny violence) but it's a lot more satisfying.Volume II focuses more on lengthy explanations and unravelling plot points, with the low impact (but still bloody) violence taking a back seat. In lesser hands, this film could have been boring and slow, but Tarantino uses concise, witty dialogue to get his point across, which allows the film to move at a good pace. He even has time to indulge himself in some comic book mythology.While you wouldn't expect a violent revenge film to be a bag of gags, Tarantino manages to wring big laughs from unlikely situations.The film starts with The Bride (Uma Thurman) recapping the audience on Volume I, including the events with led to The Bride being in a coma. The film rolls on to The Bride's confrontation with Budd (Michael Madsen), who buries her alive. Fortunately for The Bride, knowledge gained from her flashbacked training scenes with Martial Artist Pai Mei (who hams it up in a homage to the old 'Monkey' series) and gets her out of danger. After Budd meets his surprising fate, The Bride goes after the one-eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah). In one of the films' more memorable scenes, The Bride and Elle battle in a cramped caravan before an eye-catching conclusion. Kill Bill then moves to its lengthy conclusion with Bill (David Carradine), where retribution and surprises await.As in the first film, Tarantino, a major movie geek, includes little nods to his, and the films', influences. There's also a great soundtrack, including a remix of the old hit ""About Her"" by Malcolm Mclaren.Overall, this film is a unique experience, with lashings of humour, violence, intellectualism and even a bit of sentimentality.These factors alone will ensure Kill Bill Volume II will enjoy a healthy box-office run. But the real impact may not be seen until Tarantino's baby is released in its almost inevitable Volume I/Volume II DVD package, which is sure to be a hit among fan boys and movie buffs alike.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
211,troyputland,"For me, Vol. 1 is the better of the two, but Vol 2. wraps it all up nicely for us.",8,11 February 2016,"Vol. 2, Tarantino's fifth film, follows Uma Thurman's ass-kicking Bride on her revenge mission. Two members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad are down, two (and Bill) to go. Where Vol. 1 was a homage to Asian cinema, Vol. 2 is one to western films of old. Character story is chosen above the action this time, as 'The Bride', gets closer to who main target. Uma Thurman is outstanding. Routing for her until the very end is no issue, no matter the cost or the conclusion. Vol. 2 wraps up this very thick plot ('and so the plot thickens', says Bill) beautifully. It's not easy for The Bride. The harder it is for, the better it is for our viewing pleasure. Tarantino is hit his peak, slapping us in the face with slick music, quick edits and less dialogue than what we're use to.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
212,Thrashman88,Much Calmer Than Vol.I,7,29 May 2004,"People who expect the same unbridled brutality and violence of KILL BILL, VOL.I may get seriously disappointed with the more talky Vol.II. This sequel is NOT a bad movie at all; it actually shows a lot of the background of VOL.II, but by doing so, the film was rendered with a slower pace. We finally get to know WHY Bill wanted to kill the bride so much. The ending is contrived and a bit disappointing; after all, this IS a very violent revenge movie, but the way this movie ends is nowhere near as bloody as the tamest kill scene in VOL.I. I was expecting something bordering on bad taste for the final confrontation, but what we get is broadway drama. For a revenge movie, the bodycount on this one is EXTREMELY low. But what holds the movie together is our eagerness to see The Bride finding Bill and ultimately, killing him. I could have forgiven the slow pace, the talky scenes and the lack of action had the final confrontation been a real adrenaline rush, but this it was not. KILL BILL, VOL.II is still a fine movie that takes itself more seriously than the first, but by doing so, it sacrificed the youthful kinetic energy that made the original installment a more pleasant movie experience. 7* out of 10*.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
213,ritera1,"Yet again, QT is disappointing.",4,28 June 2009,"I'm not quite sure how to grasp QT. Frankly, I think he's a very good director (and a so-so action director) and makes good choices when it comes to a DP, editing and music. The guy himself I think is a nut (not in a good way) and it shows in his writing.Both Kill Bills are soulless. This is a revenge story between one psychopath against a group of psychopaths. I do have to say that QT does write interesting individual scenes, his trademark. And he probably gets good actors 'cause they're fun to play. But at the same time they are original, but as original as mashed potatoes and chocolate syrup. They're tired cliché characters repackaged with the QT brand, and that somehow is fresh?And those scenes in question. They're usually very colorful but also very trite. They rarely have an actual point.And QT doesn't know a thing about character development. Maybe that's his point, but he seems to write AROUND almost anything interesting that might come out of a story about these people. To give a comparison, the original The Crow is a very passionate revenge story about a character that you're invested in. But why do we like The Bride? 'cause she kicks ass? Who cares? I know NOTHING about this woman 'til the very end, when a weak excuse of how she SUDDENLY changed into a good guy when she found out she was pregnant.The only spark of character development was when Michael Madsen said ""she deserves her revenge."" Out of 4 hours? And this set-piece of action with the 88 at the restaurant. It was just a jumble of movements and gallons of blood. (I personally hate that wire stuff.) Even at his worst, a Jackie Chan movie has more rhythm and clarity to their action scenes than this. And even at its most corny and basic, a John Woo film has characters that you are invested in.I know I'm in the minority on this, but I just don't get it. No, this isn't about the violence. QT is the demigod of cinema, but what is he saying about anything? It's not that hard. Movies are suppose to be stories about characters. And then do whatever the bleep you want after that. But if it's about slick pretty people doing bloody things, any hack can give you THAT!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
214,dommercaldi,"Another Good Tarantino Film, But Not As Good As The First One And Let Down By Numerous Plot-Holes",7,9 October 2020,"Pros:
1. The scene wherein Beatrix Kiddo (Uma Therman) is buried alive underground, and the screen goes black and heavy breathing fills the sound system, is incredibly tense.
2. The camera-work, particularly the usage of quick-cut close-ups to raise the stakes, is great.
3. The soundtrack is fun and lively and it adds an adventurous and light-hearted touch to the movie.
4. The comedy is ridiculous and hilarious, especially the Pai Mei (Chia-Hui Liu) sequence.
5. The gore is bloody and unforgiving - exactly what you'd expect from Quentin Tarantino (Director).
6. Uma Therman, David Carradine (Bill), and Daryl Hannah (Elle Driver) deliver brilliant performances.
7. The fight scenes are extremely well-choreographed, fast-paced, intense, and very entertaining.Cons:
1. The beginning starts off way too slowly with some rather unnecessary dialogue.
2. There are a few plot-holes: A) Surely Budd (Michael Madsen) would have patted down Beatrix Kiddo all the way to her boots? B) How did Beatrix Kiddo manage to dig upwards that fast under all those tons of soil? Not only that, but she had been hit by a shotgun slug, but still had enough energy to dig, and escape with said injury.
3. The pacing is slightly off with certain scenes being pointlessly inserted or prolonged.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
215,jpintar,Another overrated Tarantino film,5,10 August 2004,"Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a step above the first Kill Bill because of David Carradine's role as Bill.  However, that is not saying much because the movie goes on so many tangents that are very distracting.   I don't understand why Kill Bill wasn't made into one movie.  I saw no reason that the two movies together could have been cut to two hours.  It spends too much time with extranous characters and situations that I simply lost patience.  None of Bill's associates are very interesting.  I don't care if you have an eye patch, Daryl Hannah, you are not a threatening assassin and don't get me started on your acting.  Quentin Tarantino seems to forget that action movies have to move fast with little dialouge or character development.  Instead we have too much talk and we learn too much about Bill's associates than we care about.  We want to see the Bride and Bill go at it one on one.  Unfortunately, it takes too long for us to get there.  We want to see the associates disposed of quickly and move on to Bill.  5/10 for its stylishness but fatally overlong.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
216,Jacques98,"Better than the first, but not as entertaining.",10,3 September 2008,"This is the only movie I've ever seen that I knew would be perfect long before it was over. When the action happens, it is much more gritty and cringe-worthy than the first Kill Bill. The final climax is nothing but sheer cliché-defying genius that I'm sure will make a lot of people made, but I still can't deny the awesome moral that it brings.This movie has some of the most amazing and intense scenes in cinema and is not to be missed by anyone. It surpasses it's processor in nearly every level. Humor, grit, genius, originality, except . . .. . . the only thing that disappointed me: the lack of blood. After the gallons of it in Kill Bill, I would have at least expected one scene for old time's sake. Also, the talking scenes can be a little boring because they're not as good as Pulp Fiction. It isn't as entertaining as the first movie, even though everything about it was improved.But this is a must see. Amazing in every way.10/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

With several scenes of violence as the first one held, some surprises, and a lot of great dialogue, you will not leave the film disappointed. However, with that being said, it wasn't quite as good as the first one. The continuation is almost like the second half of the first film, and from about the middle of the film on, it slowly decreases in intensity and for Tarentino almost has too much emotional value to it.I found it funny, entertaining and worth the rental fee, however it's not a film that I need to run out and buy. The first one was near excellence, while this one was a bit too cheesy for me. Although, I will admit there were two scenes that kept me guessing, and had me a little nervous of the outcome.All in all it's a good watch, and if you enjoyed the first volume, you should definitely check this one out.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

There was a few actions scenes which were ok, but not as good as volume 1 and they didn't last long enough. The ending was a bit disappointing as I expected more action; it was such a anticlimax.

Liu is excellent in the role as the character he fought against in Fist of The White Lotus ( A brilliant Kung Fu film with Lo Lieh directing and co-starring as Pai Mei and his twin). Gordon Liu seems to genuinely be having a great time playing his role and the film is better for it.Overall one of Trantino's better films IMHO.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

221,thenolanfan,Review - Kill Bill: Vol 2,8,10 April 2020,"Unlike his predecessor, this movie is more axed toward the drama than the action. The identity of Bill has revealed very quickly in the movie and on a certain aspect, the movie lost a part of his glamorous spirit.While I appreciate this touch of drama, I have some criticizes to do regarding the flashbacks, this flashback scenes like in many movies of Quentin Tarantino are what I call ""Facilitated screenwriting"" in other words they explain quickly a concept with the only purpose of making the rest seemingly coherent to the view, except that these sequences are mainly based on an over explanatory storytelling that Tarantino attempted to attenuate by using humor.Some scenes are however are simply masterpieces, I can take to illustrate my point, the final confrontation between The Bride and Bill. In this scene, Bill asks Beatrix if she felt satisfaction after killing her victims, to that she answers ""yes"", but in her eyes, you can see remorse. Maybe I'm over-interpreting it, but as I see it, it was a self-criticism at the violence in Tarantino's movies. He wants to highlight that all those outrageously violent scenes are for him a ""guilty pleasure"". The movie has a lot of self-references or homage which adds to the films if you have seen other Tarantino movies.Other than that this is basically a movie cut in two parts, so It wouldn't be reasonable to give a different rating to one or another. This mainly why I gave it an 8.To conclude, I recommend the Kill Bill Saga, and it might be one of
Tarantino's most complex and entertaining artwork.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
222,Darkest_Rose,Uma kicks Ass once again with more Feeling(Contains Spoilers),9,30 April 2004,"In this much anticipated sequel to the fantastic ""Kill Bill Vol.1"",Vol.2 takes us right where it left us before. Uma is not yet finished, but her revenge is close, so near she can almost smell victory. In this volume, the story takes us much more into depth with the characters, leaving us with many long, silent and emotional moments. Don't be mistaken and call these moments boring, nothing in Kill Bill is boring, every second of it is more interesting and fascinating then the previous one. But this is not all there is to Vol.2, the whole movie is just filled with so much witty humor that you can't help but chuckle to yourself. The most wonderful scenes for me were: 1.Uma being buried alive(but of course finding her way out eventually) 2.The anticipated cat-fight(if you want to call it that) between Uma and Elle Driver, and last but not least, the first acquaintance Uma makes with her daughter, that scene brought tears to my eyes. The only disappointing part for me was Bill's simple and quick death, but that is just because I was expecting more.True Kill Bill fans will not be disappointed, for Tarantino is a genius and Uma Thurman is a Goddess in so many ways, I would give Kill Bill: Vol.2 9/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

ELLE, BUDD, BILL.Not much about the story, but about the fascinating things Tarantino's camera shows us; fascinating images, characters, words.The last 30 minutes of the film have Tarantino playing with the script, including his usual irrelevant things, as he has Bill talk about Superman in detail. Then again, why do we see films. To be entertained. QT knows how to entertain and this is no different.Kill Bill 2 is a thrilling experience a wonderful contrast to the first part; this is a calmer more philosophical film rather than a violent, vulgar and graphic first part.

And what a wonderful surprise ""Vol. 2"" turned out to be. THIS is the film the first one should have been. Tarantino, again, offers a pastiche of genres, but, this time, packs it with a thoroughly engaging story, delightfully dark humor, dialogue that crackles and some inspired storytelling. ""Vol. 2"" isn't as violent. Not that I am averse to violence. But, unlike in ""Vol. 1,"" where it just became tedious, here, the bloodletting is handled with great aplomb and makes perfect sense.There are some marvelous moments in this second installment - a sensational trailer scene between Daryl Hannah (who hasn't looked this sexy in a movie in years) and the uncommonly gorgeous Uma Thurman; a terrific (and horrifying) sequence where the screen goes completely dark; a very funny Bride-Karen scene and some touching moments toward the end, made all the more believable in a movie of this sort because of an utterly convincing and captivating performance by Thurman.She's fantastic as the vengeful bride. And this time around, she's given some brilliant dialogue to play with. It's typical Tarantino and a pleasure to listen to, especially when delivered by the likes of Thurman, whose timing is immaculate, Hannah and David Carradine.Robert Richardson's cinematography is spectacular. The early black-and-white shot of Uma Thurman framed by the doorway of the Two Pines Wedding Chapel would have made John Ford proud. And, stick around to the very end. After all the end credits have rolled. You'll be rewarded with a nice surprise.""Kill Bill, Vol. 2"" is superb storytelling. From the very first frame to the last. If I had to sit through a disappointing ""Vol. 1"" to get to this, so be it. Because the payoff was truly worthwhile.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Budd (Madsen), Elle Driver (Hannah) and of course Bill (Carradine) are still to be found and disposed of in a gruesome manor.What makes Tarantino so wonderful is his layering of plot threads.  He is able to intersperse sequences so that we are given vital information which we are not immediately aware that we will need later in the storyline.  He has such complete control of his timing and rhythm as a filmmaker, and keeps us unaware of that directorial manipulation by using humor and wit and intelligence amidst a blur of action and violence.  This talent makes watching a Tarantino film an event.  I am already looking forward to his next film.The drudgery of having to slog through another special effects bonanza (yawn), or a teeny-bopper romance (puke), or an animated kiddie-flick (ugh), or a gross-out comedy (frown)... All of that nonsense is made tolerable by those dozen or so films each year that show some originality, flare, passion and brilliance.

That's why they already have courses at major universities devoted entirely to his small repertoire of films.I only have two quibbles with the entirety of 'Kill Bill'.   The film should have been released as one long movie.  I don't mind the splice too much, except for the fact that Miramax charged me twice when they said it was not a decision based on financial gain.  But I feel the film will be a delight to watch as a whole when it is released as a special edition DVD sometime this Christmas.I must also admit to being a tad underwhelmed by the final few minutes of the saga.  I like the fact that it ended in a manor that was completely unexpected... but... it almost ended with a whimper.  I am making a mountain out of a mole-hill here, but I think there is a better ending to be found deep the recesses of QT's mind.I also want to send out my mocking laughs to those who left the moment the credits started to roll.  True film lovers never leave a film that they like the moment the writing hits the screen... I only do that to films I hate. It is disrespectful to the filmmaker and to the other members of the audience who don't want to peer around you and your tub-o-popcorn to see what they paid for.  Anyway, those who left missed two more sequences of film.  And I hope Tarantino doesn't include them on the DVD so that you'll never get a chance to see them.As for the 'Kill Bill' legacy... I think it's a marvelous display of a genius filmmaker having delirious fun with all of his influences and showing off every ounce of talent that he can pour onto the screen.  Is it as earth-shattering as 'Pulp Fiction'?  No.  Is it as well written as 'Pulp' or 'Reservoir Dogs'?  No.  'Kill Bill' is not an example of masterpiece filmmaking.

Well, if you find wasting the time of your life entertaining - you are welcome to the universe of the mighty Quentino Tarantino. Big-name actors, outstanding fight sequences, and impressive storytelling - it all cries out ""We are going for gold!"" Some western characters are trying to show off as if they were Bruce Lees, Sonny Chibas or Jackie Chans. One matter makes me real uneasy: this piece dealing with second-hand trifle things, which we saw before in other movies, occupies a place of honour on IMDb top 250 list. And note that poor wire stunt on the railing (when the Japanese guy flew horizontally around the main heroine during combat) - that looked so amateurish and goofy. And if you notice that the snowfall is fake and consists of torn paper... Better watch ""Smeshariki"" or ""Luntik"" instead. Japanese actors should be ashamed to take part in this western action flick of the ""glorious master"".What about very original and entertaining ""Police Story"", ""Once Upon a Time in China"", ""City Hunter"", ""Armour of God"", and quite a number of other genuine titles? They are outsiders.

228,illbebackreviews,A brilliantly paced film,9,15 November 2012,"I'm probably one of the last people on Earth to watch Kill Bill and I'm truly glad I did watch the duology. 'Kill Bill Vol 1' was a brilliantly made Tarantino film and the ending of the first one set me up to watch the second one. From the first few minutes, I was already into this movie. I love how the Bride recounts the events and we see how the massacre happened at the wedding. Then we get to cut back to present time and we meet Bill's brother. Bill's brother is another fine character and they are thoroughly enjoyable. We also see that the Bride has come to kill Bill's brother but she fails and is mortally wounded. She is then locked up and things start getting intense. After being locked up in a coffin and buried, the Bride recounts how she was trained in martial arts by a teacher named Pai Mei. The entire training sequence was well made out and a perfectly necessary addition to the film. Then the story really begins to get intense. Budd, Bill's brother, calls Elle over about the Hanzo sword and she kills him. Then the Bride comes in and a duel ensues. The fight scenes are so well planned out and filmed with brilliant acting that its both realistic and enjoyable. Then the Bride goes to some place and asks for Bill's location and the man eventually gives it away believing that Bill will be pleased to meet her. What I like about the last half hour of the film (that is from when the Bride goes to Bill's house) is the further build-up to the ultimate showdown. Things really begin to get dense and you can feel all her hatred for him and all his malice. The ending is so brilliantly done.There are many positives about this film. The acting, especially by Uma Thurman is brilliant. She gives such a powerful role as the bride. The plot, the new characters and pretty much everything is so well executed. This is one of my four favorites of 2003: 1) Return of the King 2) Pirates of the Caribbean 3) Kill Bill Vol 2 4) Finding NemoSuch a brilliant film!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
229,ArmandoManuelPereira,Slightly More Enjoyable Then Volume 1,5,9 April 2020,"I found it slightly more enjoyable then volume 1. Partly because it possesses less of the indulgences of the first movie, and partly because the first half of it is quite tense. But from the fight scene involving Daryl Hannah, to the end my interest began to wane. The scenes with Madsen and Liu were my favorite.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
230,basrutten,"A two-hour plus episode of ""Kung Fu""",6,28 December 2004,"Seriously, I don't get why the ""Kill Bill"" movies are held in such high regard. I loved the first three Tarantino movies and thought ""Kill Bill Vol 1"" was OK. ""Volume 2"", however, is one of the biggest disappointments I've ever seen recently.""Kill Bill 2"" continues the (paper-thin) plot of the first movie, but otherwise it's almost completely different. There is almost no action, much less eye candy (part 1 was ""style over substance"", while this one has neither substance NOR style), and a lot more talking. Normally, you'd say that a Tarantino movie with tons of dialog would be a good thing, right? In this case, however, I found the dialogs to be fairly boring. There are still a couple of amusing parts, but for the most part it's random chit-chat between rather dull characters you don't care about and don't relate to.For all it's differences, there's also something that both Kill Bill movies have in common: they're both way too long. In part one, the violence got boring long before the end, and in this movie all the talking becomes boring even faster. Face it, a very simple and predictable revenge story just isn't enough to fill four hours of movie, but Tarantino over-indulges himself in way too many things that he thinks are cool or clever, whereas mostly they're just lame or silly. I have to admit that Kill Bill 2 does a couple of things right, though. The flashback about the martial arts training by an ancient Chinese master is entertaining, and the fight between The Bride and Elle Driver is marvelous. I also think that David Carradine does a wonderful job of playing Bill. But those are only a couple of bright spots in a sea of dull dialog and unnecessary scenes.In the end, ""Kill Bill Vol 2"" is a two-hour plus episode of the old TV series ""Kung Fu"": it's about martial arts, there are flashbacks, and there's a lot of talking and very little action. If you're into old Kung Fu movies, chances are that you'll still love this one. But for those who actually prefer an interesting story and characters over a lot of supposedly cool fluff, ""Kill Bill Vol 2"" is best described as ""fairly boring"".**1/2 out of ***** stars",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
231,dcldan,impressive second part,9,10 August 2006,"Continuing the other film, vol. 2 tell us the story of the revenge of the Bride. After killing Vermita Green and O'Ren Ishii, Black Mamba continues its duty by searching Budd and Elle, in order to later kill Bill. Much less violent that the first part, vol. 2 is much more poetic, as it tells us many things about the motivations of the characters. The curious resignation of Budd(impressive Michael Madsen, absolutely fantastic), the evilness of Elle (unexpected Daryl Hannah) and the total charisma of Bill (mythic Carradine) marks the development of the drama, as the Bride meets everyone. With a delicious treatment of the dialogues and the music this is possibly, the best film from Tarantino and his violent universe. This time though, the violence is most psychological rather that physic, its more an impressive fight of wills which builds one of the best films of the decade of 2000. Despite that, remember that it is a Tarantino film. there is not much violence on the movie, but it is totally present in every moment of the film, which cannot result comfortable to everybody.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
232,FairlyAnonymous,"Not nearly as clever or entertaining as Vol. 1, but still good",7,23 November 2014,"*LOTS OF SPOILERS AHEAD* Kill Bill Vol. 2 can either be regarded as ingenious for the way it does the opposite of the viewer's expectations or it can be considered mediocre-bad because it doesn't deliver anything as satisfying as the first film.Kill Bill Vol. 2 is interesting in the fact that it has only ONE true action sequence, where as the rest of the movie is literally either flashbacks or dialogue. Yes. It is one of THOSE movies. This is where this movie's biggest problems start to show and it becomes obvious that these movies were meant to be shown as one movie and not to. Vol. 2, as a standalone film, is pretty boring and uninteresting because it is filled with flashbacks and subplots. It is really peculiar how many mini subplots are fit into this movie that really take away from what the main appeal of the first movie was. While the first movie dedicated 30 minutes or so into one action sequence (and about 10-15 minutes building up to it) this movie is mostly dialogue with one action sequence that lasts only a couple of minutes. Now this could work if the first movie wasn't a fast-paced martial arts movie, but it was... so you have Vol. 1 which is cheesy yet action-packed and then you have Vol. 2 which is mostly dialogue. Does this work?What most people will say is that this works because you usually want a more serious tone for a climax and you want to dive more into your character and their back-story before you finish the movie. However, with this movie, that doesn't work because of a couple of reasons, but mostly one: 1) The dialogue isn't interesting 2) Bill isn't an interesting Villain. In the first movie we were lead to believe that Bill was going to be this intimidating villain with a lot of presence, but once we actually see him he starts to come off as a genuinely nice guy who is also a murderer. While this concept could work, the issue is that he still needs to have a presence on screen. Bill doesn't. There is nothing about him that is either intimidating, threatening, interesting, or overly unique. He is just plain. Him being plain may have been what Tarantino was going for, but it makes someone we do not care about. Do I care about Bill if he dies? No. Do I care if Bill is sad? No. Do I care if Bill is happy? No. So why should I care about him as a villain if he isn't interesting?This mixed with very mediocre dialogue makes the final 30 minutes of the movie obnoxious. I loved Pulp Fiction and I am all for complex dialogue exchanges, but this finale simply doesn't give any interesting dialogue. A climax where rivals talk can work only if what they are saying is genuinely interesting or clever. Here, it isn't. So basically while the last 30 minutes of the last movie is all action, the last 30 minutes of this movie has an uninteresting villain who talks about uninteresting things for 30 minutes. Sounds like fun? It isn't.I respect this movie for what it was trying to do, but I don't think it pulled it off well... at all. I think instead of the ending being a clever twist, it was more of a slap in the face. The fact that the movie tries to say that The Bride and someone old enough to be her father were in love is not only slightly unsettling, but it kind messes up the entire motivation of the story. If they really were in love and she did run away then she would've had to expect something. It kind of takes away the entire significance of her being... A BRIDE. The point was that she lost so much on her wedding rehearsal and that she is getting revenge for that. But when you realize she didn't really love the groom and didn't really care for any of the people that were murdered... it kind of breaks the entire motivation of the series. Basically, she SHOULD'VE known this was going to happen because in this movie it almost seems logical that her wedding rehearsal was logical. She literally runs away from her lover and gets married to some dude almost immediately (whom she doesn't really care for) and yet she doesn't expect her lover to get mad? Lastly, the camera work in this movie is half that of the first movie. The first movie had beautiful cinematography, but this movie just feels standard. There are no open-top-set-shots, no crazy foot shots, and nothing much of note as far as camera work goes. Pretty standard.All in all, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is good, but it isn't incredibly good. It takes away a lot of the charm of the first movie and replaces it with very uninteresting dialogue.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
233,wnterstar,A Masterpiece!,9,22 January 2005,"I had heard so much about this movie before I saw it. Yet none of what I heard/read prepared me for the brilliance of this movie. Quenton Tarantino knows all the hooks that make a great movie and uses all of them here.It's strange, because, I kinda know what's going to happen throughout the movie, yet the movie kept surprising me. You know Bill has to die at the end, but yet.....There are so many WONDERFUL performances throughout the movie, but two stood out to me: David Carradine, and Daryl Hannah.David Carradine is brilliant with his understated performance, going from affable, to menacing quickly and smoothly. You understand his side of things at the end and find yourself thinking....""Well, maybe"" before you remember that there were other people in that chapel besides The Bride and he is a hardened killer who, although he regrets what he did to The Bride, he never expresses remorse for the others.Daryl Hannah shows another side to her acting which, in my humble opinion, was just as shocking as seeing Charlize Theron in Monster. The public is not used to seeing Hannah as a hardened character. She usually plays the sweet, lovely girl. The films I have seen her in have all been fluffy and light. Even Clan of the Cave Bear wasn't as gritty as the book had been. I feel she comes into her own in this movie and shows what a real craftsman she can be.One of the things I liked most about this movie was that it was a serious movie that didn't take itself seriously. There were several moments when you couldn't help but smile (the scene where The Bride is being taught by Pei Mei is a classic!) At the end, when they show scenes from the movie as they roll credits, when they show David Carradine...well, ya gotta see it to believe it...BRILLIANT!!!!!!!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
234,MrPupkin,A lock with golden key.,9,22 October 2019,"One of Tarantino's best, Kill Bill Vol. 2 takes a less is more approach. The violence is not nearly as prevalent or bloody, but the adept storytelling and captivating dialogue (with an amazing performance from Uma Thurman) makes this one of the greatest revenge tales ever told.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
235,brianberta,Makes the original look like a masterpiece,2,19 December 2015,"When movie sequels are released, the common audience and critics consensus is usually that the sequel isn't as good as the original. Some sequels are pretty good but most people view the original as the better movie when compared to each other. I have seen very few sequels which are widely considered to be better than the original. Sadly, this is a case where the sequel to an already bad movie is so horrible that it makes the original one look like a masterpiece.The Bride is back and she is continuing her quest for vengeance. In the previous film, she killed Vernita Green and O-Ren Ishii. In this movie, she must kill Bill's brother Budd, Elle, and Bill. Many things happen during her quest and she faces many life threatening situations so killing them proves to be quite a difficult task.My first issue with this movie is that it contains many pointless scenes which drag the movie out even more. The movie could've been cut down a lot more if these scenes were removed. While it's nice to see her training montage and the massacre on the day of the wedding rehearsal, these scenes slow the movie down and they only show things that I have already been made aware of or am not interested in learning about. I wanted to get back to the main action and I didn't want to keep on seeing pointless interruptions which I found to be uninteresting.Another huge problem with the film is that it has much more talking and less action than the first film. Volume 1 was much more fast paced and it had more scenes of action and fighting. However, since the pacing in this movie is much slower, it makes it harder for fans of the original who became use to its fast pacing to get into this one and become engaged. Come to think of it, I don't think that Kill Bill ever needed to be divided up into 2 parts anyways. It should've just been one movie and it would've been a better film as a result since it would fix the problems with the pacing from the 2nd movie.Also, the main villain (Bill) feels very one-note and is very dull. Even though David Carradine gives a magnificent performance, I didn't like his character at all. He also gets some of the most stupid lines in the film including a theory that The Bride is a killer on the inside and that she wears her more mature self as a disguise similar to Superman (because as we all know, soldiers are destined to kill people for the rest of their lives since they once did it on the frontlines). One thing that I really hate about the film is that the more interesting characters are killed off first. Elle is easily the best character in the movie since she has the most personality. Also, Budd's trailer home provides a great atmosphere with gorgeous cinematography and his performance is filled with charisma. I wished that the film was more about them then some crazy psychopath and a one-note main villain. I guess the moral to this movie is that the more interesting your character is, the quicker you are killed off.Also, the ending to this film is an enormous disaster and I could not feel any form of enjoyment after the movie ended regardless how hard I tried. One of my complaints with the first film was that the fight between The Bride and O-Ren Ishii didn't contain much swordplay and had more instances of them standing around and talking. I didn't think that the final fight could be any worse in this film, but it is. It is even more drawn out and there is even less fighting between them then there was in the original film. There were a few scenes when Bill shot her with a dart and held her at gunpoint, but those scenes really didn't contain any fighting so I was just waiting for those scenes to end so that the movie could get to the actual swordplay between them. Also, what makes the ending even worse is that when she reunites with her daughter after so long, I couldn't feel any sympathy for her whatsoever as I thought that she would make a horrible mother based on what she did (this is something she even admits to by saying that she can never live a normal life). Throughout the 2 films, she chopped numerous people's body parts off, killed a mother in front of her daughter, ripped someone's eyeball out and stepped on it, slammed a doctor's head between a door until he died, and many other things too. Because of this, it makes the film's ending harder to swallow and take seriously as a happy ending.The film is a little less sadistic than the first film, but it still contains a fair amount of sadism. Examples of it include someone's eye being pulled out and stepped on, a man getting bitten by a snake over and over again and dying a painful death because of it, and a blind woman running around and screaming in agony. Because of these scenes, the film feels very crass as a result and I wish that Tarantino would just grow up already and use violence maturely and not just for the sake of it.In conclusion, this movie is a disaster and it should be avoided at all costs. It does have some good things to it such as great acting, some of the action is pretty good, and, while maybe a little less impressive, the cinematography is pretty good in some scenes (mainly the scenes which take place in the desert). However, these few flaws don't even come close to overshadowing the numerous flaws it has with pointless scenes, pacing issues, unlikeable characters, a horrible ending, and sadism. This film is completely garbage.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Well whatever this second part was also very great but I felt at some points that it lacked the amount of interest that was present in the first part. If I do not compare it in any sense with the first one then I am sure this one stands alone with a different reputation. May be because in this part they focused on the back story and lacked the energy which was going on continuously in the first film. But no complains what so ever. I am just comparing till now. Otherwise this film is also a master piece in its own sense. Things are shown in such realities that I at some point of time was thinking like oh please do not do this way or that.

I'm that sense, this film is a sequel as well as kind of a prequel.I must admit, at first I thought this was going to be a boring and long film. There were some new characters and stuff that didn't seem too interesting and I really didn't care about them. Then suddenly in the middle or so the film takes off. The entire wedding chapel scene is shown and we get to finally see who's Bill. But for me, the film gets really interesting in the chapter, 'Elle and I'. Then it only goes upward from there. Tension is high and you are completely immersed.Upon first viewing, I didn't care about the training scenes and thought em to be unnecessary. But upon subsequent viewings I really understood them better and thus enjoyed the whole movie a lot more as I definitely knew the Best was yet to come.Kill Bill is no doubt a more iconic and captivating film, but this still is a great sequel and carries the story forward quite well.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

There is much more dialogs than in the first part and some other scenes which reminded me of Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The scene where The Bride was buried alive was kinda creepy. I also liked the training scene. It reminded me of all those classic Kung Fu films I've seen. When I watched the first part I couldn't decide which character of Kill Bill is my favorite, but now I know it's Budd (Michael Madsen). I liked the way he talked that they deserve to die and The Bride deserve to get her revenge on them but she also deserve to die too. The second my favorite character was Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah).

240,peeedeee-94281,The Weaker of the two and one of Tarantino's worst films,3,19 November 2019,"When I saw this in the theaters, I really disliked it. I was expecting something on the level of Vol 1, but instead got a self-indulgent, talky with a little bit of action. There was really only one good fight scene, and that was between Elle Driver and The Bride.
I decided to give it another viewing with the blu ray version, but I found myself fast-forwarding a lot of it instead.
I liked the homage to old kung fu films with the Pai Mei training sequence, but I didn't care for how the sequence was filmed. I also didn't like how Elle Driver was able to kill him so easily. Come on!
Another part of the movie that bothered me was the whole Bud sequence. First of all, it made the movie drag. Secondly, The Bride acts completely out of character. I mean, she's supposed to be the best assassin, already killed two (included dozens of highly trained fighters in Japan) and yet she insisted on running through Bud's trailer's front door?!! Why did she hide underneath it, she could have just broken in and waited for him inside. None of that made sense. Strangely, the Bride never says a single word to Bud in the film. She spits and moans, that's it.
Bill's dialogue was so dull. Stop making old soul song references! We get it Tarantino, in the geeky fan-boy voice you give every character, you like R&B and kung fu. Speaking of music, the musical cues in this film were also out of place. Many just didn't fit their scenes.
By the end of the film, you didn't care if The Bride found her daughter, or had her name Beatrix revealed, or if she even Killed Bill.
Overall, a dull entry into Tarantino's filmography, and the weaker of the two parts.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
241,robsta23,More Dialogue,8,5 December 2015,"The bloodshed continues in this conclusion to a great two-part film experience. It continues, but there is less of it as none of these villains rely on heavy arsenals of ""bodyguards"" as in the case of Cottonmouth in vol. 1.The main thing this film accomplishes is that it fleshes out the main characters - The Bride and Bill - so much more than in the first installment. We actually get to see Bill's face throughout the film, witness the two having real conversations to develop their relationship, and we even witness some complex emotions from the Bride. Where the first Kill Bill was fun, vol. 2 is more about the characters.This is not to say that vol. 2 is not a fun film. It is extremely fun - my friend audibly expressed satisfaction at certain moments throughout the film as it was his first time watching volumes 1 and 2 over the past two days. It is also notably very tense towards the conclusion of the film, and in this film Tarantino once again proves to be the master of the monologue with a great segment in which the mythology of a super hero is discussed. It certainly doesn't match up to the intro to Inglourious Basterds or Calvin Candie's monologue in Django Unchained, but its placement in the film is nearly perfect.One disappointing factor of this movie is that, in my opinion, it seems to have a cop out instead of a well fleshed conclusion. I can't say much past this without a major spoiler, so I'll say you simply have to watch the movie to see what I am referring to. In a movie that incorporates the martial arts the conclusion may satisfy some, but I think it is a tad ridiculous compared to the rest of the two films put together.While this film may impress me just a little less than the first, I am still eager to see The Whole Bloody Affair at a theater in my lifetime if I get the opportunity.3.0/4.0",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

244,ryan_kuhn,"""You and I Have Unfinished Business.""",10,13 February 2005,"I let this movie soak into my conscience for a day or so before I began to break it down. At first, I was a tad disappointed in this follow up to 2003's Kill Bill, Vol. 1, not a prequel to this sequel, rather the first half of the story. It turned out rather that Volume 1 was the appetizer to the main course that is Volume 2. If you recall, Volume 1 finds Uma Thurman's annoyingly unnamed Bride waking from a coma after her former boss and love interest Bill has her wedding party whacked by a gang of killers. By the end of the first volume, 2 of the 4 Bill underlings had been disposed of, leaving the Bride to exact her revenge against Bill's brother Budd (Michael Madsen) and Bill's current lover, the one-eyed Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah in super-bitch overdrive, a tasty character to be sure). Poor Budd had given up the world of murder for hire to become the under-appreciated bouncer at a California strip joint when the Bride re-enters his life, but he still has a knack for finding the ""right"" way of taking care of his former business. What he does to a captured foe is down right frightening for those who are claustrophobic or have a deep down fear of pre-mature burial. Elle on the other hand is calculating, cold, unwavering as she maneuvers herself through a transaction that leaves her on the winning end of the deal ultimately. Her battle with The Bride (where we finally learn her name, and the buildup really isn't that payoff we were looking for, but perhaps that was the point) is a Jerry Springer Show watcher's dream, two good looking blondes fighting it out in a trailer in the middle of nowhere. The outcome of that battle is ironic and leaves the viewer guessing what happens after the camera leaves the trailer. The ultimate scenes between the Bride and Bill are heartbreaking. Who would have guessed a movie with Quentin Tarantino, where nothing is to be taken seriously, has a genuine heart tugging set of events to end the film. Bill is played wonderfully by David Carridine, a man who knows who he is (""A murdering bastard""), knows how to raise the daughter of a woman he tried to kill (The Bride's daughter, THE source of the emotional conflict at the end of the movie), and even knows why he likes Superman over the other comic book hero's. Some people have complained that the ultimate scene was a bit of a letdown, and after the ballet of sword and fake blood that was the Bride-Crazy 88's battle in Volume 1, anything is quieter and slower and more poignant than that, and that's what Tarantino gives us here. There are no surprises to the plot of the movie as the story goes, but Volume 2 does fill in the holes on what happened, why everything happened the way they did, and how it made each character feel. The Bride is a warrior of zero emotion in Volume 1, the total opposite here in Volume 2. Tarantino goes from the far East film experience in Volume 1 to a Sergio Leone Western film in Volume 2 with sweeping landscapes, music featuring both guitars and trumpets (in fact, most of the most important songs are directly from A Fist Full of Dollars and other Leone movies), snakes and dirt and a dash for cash, all of which Clint Eastwood would feel at home in. The only thing I found askew when it came to Volume 2 was how complete it is compared to Volume 1. The credits give this away. Tarantino dips into the 1940s style of credits with fancy script fonts and the gray scale background, and even the opening music reminded me of something one would here at the beginning of a 1930s film. This is not a negative, but it just makes Volume 1 now feel like something to warm the audience up with, then the real meal comes with Volume 2. The credits go on for about 15 minutes and features a montage of all of the important characters in the movie, much like the end of the Super Mario Brothers video games, when you beat the game, the show you everyone you defeated to win it all. I don't know if Tarantino had that in mind when piecing it together, but it worked for me. After the day of playing the movie again through my mind, I found this movie much more satisfying than the first one. The story, the pace, the dialogue, all much slower, and slower is often better. The energy that is shown in Volume 1 is thrown away here, and the movie is much better for it. I personally think putting the two films back together would be risky. The styles are so different, the pace is so different between the two volumes, I don't know if I would enjoy a complete film as much as I do now as two separate pieces. Kill Bill, Volume 2 is a success from the story, the visuals, the music, and the actors all working as one, as the ultimate snake charmer, Tarantino, puts it all together.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
245,MF210,A Very Difficult Film to Review,10,23 April 2004,"My Review: ***1/2 out of ****.SpoilersWhen I wrote my review for Kill Bill Volume 1, I said I would raise the rating to a 3 1/2 if Volume 2 completed the story in a satisfying way. Well it did it in a much more than satisfying way. Volume 2 is a compelling film with many scenes of greatness. So many that in fact they almost erase the small sense of dissatisfaction(more on that later).Volume 2 is a different film from Volume 1. Volume 1 was a kinetic, stylish, kung fu gorefest homage. Volume 2 is a slower, talky film that has more in common with spaghetti westerns than kung fu. Its still a stylish film but the action and the violence are toned down.In terms of action, it was unlikely that anything in Volume 2 would top the Crazy 88 Gang Fight in Volume 1. However, the fight between The Bride (or her name is Beatrix Kiddo) and Elle Driver comes close to matching it. Its a brutal, exhilirating fight that is masterfully directed and ends with a hilarious moment. This is just one of many great scenes.
Stylistically, Tarantino does a lot with this film (arguably more than he did with Volume 1). He uses a split screen during the Elle Driver fight. He changes the theatrical ratio during one scene(Im not sure I have ever seen that done before). Tarantino also does a bunch of extreme close ups (ala Sergio Leone). Once again, he shoots some scenes in Black and White (Including the opening which is brilliant). However, there is one scene that really deserves mention. That is the scene in which the Bride is first placed in the coffin and buried alive. When shes being buried alive Tarantino uses black and white which makes the scene extremely uncomfortable (as it should be). Than he switches to just total darkness. The scene is brilliantly filmed and it is just another great scene in Volume 2.
Now we come to Volume 2's most obvious strength: The Performances. Uma Thurman was terrific in Volume 1 (she deserved but did not get an Oscar Nomination). But its her performance in Volume 2 that proves she is one of the best actresses working today. The character is developed much more in Volume 2 and Thurman proves she is more than up to the task. Its a more emotional performances and Thurman nails it. She better get an Oscar Nomination this year.Thurman isn't the only one to turn in a top notch performance. David Carradine matches her scene for scene (although he does have less screentime). Carradine also develops Bill into a more complex individual. Bill isn't an evil, over the top individual. Carradine shows us the human side of Bill. Tarantino originally had Warren Beatty in mind for the role, but I can't imagine anyone doing a better job than Carradine.
The supporting performances are also top notch. Remember Daryl Hannah? The sweet, shy actress who played innocent characters like the mermaid in Splash. Well theres none of that here. Hannah is frighteningly evil as Elle Driver. Michael Madsen also does an excellent job as Budd. Gordon Liu is a standout in an interesting segment of the film, he plays the person who trained Beatrix.I will not deny that Volume 2 strengthens Volume 1. It fills in the holes. However, Volume 2 has some weaknesses of its own. First of all, like I mentioned, this is a talky film. But no one in their right mind will confuse the dialogue in Volume 2 with Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. The dialogue in Volume 2 is occassionally bland which causes some scenes to drag. I wish Tarantino would have shortened the film just a little. I mean there are some memorable lines (""Roar and Rampage"" monologue for example) but just don't expect Pulp Fiction-type dialogue.Put separately, I would say for right now, the two films are equal. They are both compelling films with many great scenes but there is still a small sense of dissatisfaction. If Tarantino puts the two films together and possibly cut a few scenes from both than he could have a masterpiece on his hands, just like he did with Pulp Fiction. For now, I stronlgy recommend Volume 1 and Volume 2 but I would just love to see them together.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
246,MF210,Tarantino really is a maserful filmmaker,10,15 November 2004,"My Rating: **** out of ****. Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill films can take their place as one of the best series in the history of film. Kill Bill Volume 1 and Volume 2 truly highlight(even more than his other films), how much he loves movies. These two films show his mastery of the medium. With these films, Tarantino is basically taking everything from the movies (or maybe the genres) he loves and mixing them together to form something fresh, which he has accomplished.However, Tarantino's two films are radically different in tone. Volume 1 was a masterful kung-fu homage with some spaghetti western thrown in. That film showed that Tarantino was skillful in crafting action sequences and creating his most visually stunning film yet. It was a masterpiece and an instant classic. Kill Bill Volume 2 is something different. Its mostly a spaghetti western with a little kung fu thrown in. While Tarantino shoots some great action sequences here, Volume 2 is not as concerned with action as its predecessor was. Instead, this film focuses on characters, dialogue and an emotional impact. Out of all Tarantino's previous films, Volume 2 has more in common with the underrated Jackie Brown than Volume 1. Both films slowed their pace in order to develop their characters and both were going for a more emotional impact than any other of Tarantino's films. Volume 1's main purpose was to be a great thrill ride and give us a glimpse of things to come later on in the story. Even though Volume 2 is more concerned with an emotional impact, it still has some thrilling scenes. There is a scene where The Bride is buried alive that is brilliantly filmed and as a result gives off a claustrophobic feel. We feel like were in the coffin with the bride. Also, the fight sequence between The Bride and Elle Driver is an exhilarating sequence. It may not quite be up to the final battle in Volume 1, but its damn close.Another individual who deserves a lot of credit in making these films is Cinematographer Robert Richardson. Richardson's work on Volume 1 was just gorgeous and while is work here isn't as impressive, he still shines. The style is more subdued here but Richardson's camera-work during the Bride/Elle fight scene is terrific. He is also able to recapture the look of old kung fu films in one brilliant sequence (The Bride's training sequence with the treacherous Pei Mei). Richardson's work on these films is brilliant and he should get more credit. Now we come to the emotional part of the film. The Brides quest is finally coming to the end. She is in Bills apartment about to shoot him when something unbelievably shocking is revealed to her: Her daughter that she believed was killed when she was shot is alive. the look on The Brides face is truly heartbreaking. The sequences with her and her daughter are touching. This is what she started killing for and now she has what she thought she lost four years ago. Then there is the Bill/Bride situation. Oh I forgot to mention, she has a name: Beatrix Kiddo. The fight sequence at the end between them is more words than action. It isn't extremely satisfying on a visceral level but it is satisfying on an emotional level. These two no matter what they did to each other still cared about each other and a huge, epic battle would have cheapened their feelings for each other. The acting is outstanding in all corners. Uma Thurman is just brilliant in this role. She shows the Bride was a more complex woman than we were lead to believe. Whether she does get an Oscar Nomination or not is in question, but she deserves it. Michael Madsen turns in truly spectacular work too. This man is not some fodder for her to kill, his Budd is also more complex than I expected. Daryl Hannah is marvelous here. She plays against type as a cold, ruthless killer. Hannah removes all image of her nice girl roles here. The standout is definitely David Carradine. Carradine is just sensational here. He opens Bill up, this is not some cartoonish figure with shallow motivations. He comes across as a real, deep person. Carradine deserves not only a nomination for his work, but the Oscar. Kill Bill Volume 2 shows Tarantino at his best. His direction is flawless and he is back to writing dialogue. His dialogue here, while not ""classic"" Tarantino, is solidly written. Overall, Volume 2 is equally as accomplished as Volume 1 and these two together are a masterful saga.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
247,patrick_dunne,"Kill Bill Volume Two redeems itself a little bit from the flaws of the first volume, but carries flaws of its own",6,2 January 2006,"I hated Kill Bill Volume One. No, I have not seen all of it, but of what I have seen: I thought it was terrible. For example, half the film was style and violence, and the ""Bang! Bang!"" song seemed to set it up as a drama. (These were only a few flaws.) Luckily, the Kill Bill series was able to redeem itself with Kill Bill Volume Two. The nameless Bride starts out in a scene talking about her attack, in a scene that seems too much to be like a Mystery Science Theatre Movie. After that long scene is done, we are introduced to Bill and Budd. Budd agrees to help Bill kill The Bride and return the sell the so-called priceless sword. But, to kill Bill, The Bride goes to a Shoaling Temple to learn the deadly ""Five Point Palm-Exploding Heart Technique."" Kill Bill Volume Two improves on two of the main flaws of the first one. The first film was 100% violence, and the only thing besides that was a whole lot of incoherence. Kill Bill Volume Two has hardly any violence. It has more story than the original. This is an improvement. The second flaw was that the ""Bang! Bang!"" song in the beginning seems to set Kill Bill Volume One up as a drama. Volume Two is more of a drama, and the ending is fairly touching.However, even if Volume Two improves on the first one, it creates some flaws of its own. First of all, the whole film is over-drawn. It seemed like Tarintino was trying to put a short script into 136 minutes, which makes the film pretty boring at times. Bill's ""superhero speech,"" the goldfish speech, the introduction of the ""Two Chapels Massacre,"" the fight between Elle and The Bride, and the whole thing about Budd's job all had one thing in common: They were hideously over-drawn. The second flaw was that the film seemed to try to be a kung-fu movie. I heard it was Tarintino's style to copy ""B movies,"" but nobody wants to watch a modern-day cheesy flick. Some things that made Kill Bill Volume Two look like a corny ""B movie"" were: the sudden zooms on the camera, the times the sensei flips his beard, and the colorful background with black figures. I recall somebody saying ""They must have felt so goofy working for Quentin Tarintino."" Kill Bill Volume Two is an improvement, but it still has flaws of its own. If you hated the first like me, than you might want to pick this one up, unless you think you will hate it equally as much.6/10 Good: Drama and Action Bad: Over-drawn, corny B-movie style and carries some of the flaws of the first volumeFeel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
248,michael_the_nermal,More Straightforward Than Part One,6,6 December 2009,"Volume 2 does indeed tie up the loose ends of Volume 1, but it does so in a rather abrupt and ultimately unsatisfying way. Unlike Part 1, which was mostly guts, gore, and flash, Volume 2 is rather crisp, sticking to the plot in a straightforward manner without going off on tangents. The film sticks to the protagonist, Black Mamba's, quest for vengeance without going into side stories about the antagonists' pasts, nor engaging in 40-minute swordfights with hundreds of henchmen. This is no action movie; really, the murders of the remaining assassins are, compared to Black Mamba's epic sword duel with Cottonmouth in Volume 1, incredibly quick (including *SPOILER ALERT* Bill's, the main antagonist of Volume 2). Black Mamba does not even kill off Sidewinder, a trailer- trash strip joint bouncer who also happens to be Bill's brother! I was hoping Black Mamba would engage in epic sword fights with Mountain Snake (Daryll Hannah of ""Splash!"" fame) and Bill (the late David Carradine, Grasshopper of ""Kung-Fu""). Mountain Snake suffers the fate of the criminal who taunted Jesus at Calvary, also graphically depicted in a film that came out the same year as Volume 2, ""Passion of the Christ."" MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!Black Mamba's killing of Bill is so sudden compared to her long, drawn-out trek for the lesser assassin, Cottonmouth, that this film's climax seems hollow. No ""Hanzo sword duel"" as promised; just quick, sudden revenge. Tarantino deliberately wanted to bum out his audience, who craved the action, clanking swords, and epic battles between killers of equal caliber of the first film by denying Uma from fighting her main antagonist in any satisfying way. This film, compared to the top-heavy first part, was a little *too* focused on plot and not on action. As a result, the villains come off as easy enemies for the ""world's greatest assassin"" to vanquish. Tarantino wanted to save the best fight first (that with Lucy Liu's Mafia Queen character) and thus let us down by denying us any good fights with the villains, whom we, the audience, would assume are superior fighters to Lucy Liu's character (I was expecting Daryll Hannah's Mountain Snake to kick major butt, but Tarantino utterly ruined what could have been a cool fight scene). Uma ultimately reveals to Bill why she left his elite group of assassins; and, while heart-rending, it does not save this film from the huge disappointment of Tarantino preventing Black Mamba from clanking swords with Bill, the Grand Master of all the assassins, in an epic showdown. Mr T. is Hollywood's biggest letdown artist.Only Uma Thurman shows plenty of acting skill, compared to the other actors, as the protagonist. Black Mamba is no longer a superhero, as she was in Volume 1, but she is still one of the few characters to show much emotion or to elicit any sympathy from the audience. Bill and his brother Sidewinder are soft-spoken killers, and their understated characterizations are nice to watch, but by no means more interesting than Black Mamba. There is a cool flashback scene where Black Mamba learns the trade of Kung-Fu from a strict sensei; this actor was awesome as the harsh, if spirit-building, martial arts instructor. Daryll Hannah's character is shown to be treacherous and slimy, yet understated like Bill. Still, Hannah's character does not have the backstory or enough meat to her personality to make her as interesting as she deserved to be (she is set up to be a far more interesting villain than Lucy Liu's Cottonmouth, but Tarantino lets us down).While lean and straightforward to Volume 1, Volume 2 does seem to be style over substance, with an eclectic soundtrack and homages to Kung- Fu and spaghetti western movies that I have never seen. In all, a movie for those ""in the know"" about cinema, but, with an easy-to-follow plot line, which means that it is far more audience friendly than Volume 1.In short, Tarantino is grossly overrated as a genius infant terrible of cinema. He should limit his films for a narrow art-house audience, rather than make any attempt to be mainstream---either that, or he should only make his movies for his select group of Hollywood buddies for Sunday-night viewings in his mansion.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
249,lagriff05,"Yep, I liked this one better.",8,4 April 2008,"Here's where things really kick into gear. Paying homage to cheesy martial arts flicks, Wild West shootouts, revenge flicks and more all in one go, the second half of Kill Bill could only have been topped if both films had been released in one box.Again, this isn't perfect, but it is extremely enjoyable. The plot comes into full here, and thus we are able to more fully enjoy Kill Bill. The film's saving grace is David Carradine, though, who is playing every bit the character I expect from Tarantino's flicks. Memorable dialogue and spot on acting and conviction ensure that Carradine's performance is ace, only aided by the excellent performances of a number of side characters. Kill Bill is truly an adventure, with the blending of genres a key point in its enjoyability, alongside Tarantino's signature stylistic eccentricities. There's nothing else like this movie out there, and for connoisseurs and lovers of film, this is pure gold all the way through.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
250,Ronin47,QT has done it again. (****),10,8 June 2004,"When I saw ""Kill Bill: Vol. 1"" last October, it was one of the most amazing experiences I'd ever had in a movie theater. Combining pretty much everything I've ever loved about movies since I was a little kid into one fantastic (half of a) film, it was like a blast of pure oxygen, a jolt of adrenaline that stayed with me for weeks. ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" is not the same kind of film. The people who are saying that the two movies are very different in tone and style are correct. This is by no means a bad thing, though, because their differences make for a fascinating comparison. ""Vol. 1"" is paced to kill, a movie that seldom pauses for character development or even dialogue, yet STILL possesses extraordinary emotional depth, mostly because of Uma Thurman's stunning, Oscar-worthy performance. The Bride (whose name is revealed in ""Vol. 2"") is one of the most fiercely sympathetic characters in movie history. ""Vol. 2"" is much more introspective and relaxed, more about emotions than violence (although there is plenty of it). I have a feeling that many will be bored with it, as they were with ""Jackie Brown"". But like ""Jackie Brown"", I think this film will also reveal layers upon layers of riches upon each viewing, and will age beautifully. In ""Vol. 1"", The Bride crossed O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) off of her death list, and now in ""Vol. 2"" she has three people left to kill who played a hand in the Massacre at Two Pines: Budd (Michael Madsen), the one-eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and of course Bill (a great David Carradine), none of whom are going to make it easy for her.
During a terrifying scene where the Bride is buried alive, the film switches to a flashback of her days as a student of the ruthless kung-fu master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu). This sequence is actually my favorite part of the whole movie, and Pai Mei is hands down one of the most entertaining characters I've seen in a long time. When the flashback ends and we find out why the Bride was remembering his teachings at that particular moment, it has a remarkable emotional payoff (set to the gloriously triumphant ""L'Arena"" from one of Ennio Morricone's spaghetti western scores). In the end, I think I slightly prefer the no-holds-barred mayhem of ""Vol. 1"" to the more laid-back ""Vol. 2"", but is it still a totally awesome and entertaining movie? Does the story come to a satisfactory conclusion? And is Uma Thurman's performance just as extraordinary as it was in the first film? Yes, yes and yes. Hell yes.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
251,chiumt,A Fitting Followup To A Classic,8,12 May 2019,"This is more of a continuation of the first installment, rather than a sequel. A lot is explained here. The classic trademarks of Tarantino are here. This is the second time I am watching this and it has remained fresh.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
252,jay4stein79-1,"Taken as a whole, it's a great achievement",8,9 April 2006,"I felt electrified after watching Kill Bill, Vol. 1, but felt that something essential was missing. I was dazed, my head spinning; it was a caffeine buzz. The first film flies by in a heartbeat. With Volu. 2, Tarantino takes a step back and creates a languid and more mature film. It's a great combination when taken together. The dizzying riffs on popular culture present in the first film slow down for Volume 2, allowing us to absorb them. I felt tired after watching Vol. 1; after Vol. 2 I was exhausted, but on an emotional level. The first film, with its beautiful gore and wonderful set-pieces, drags you along at a harrowing pace, while Vol. 2 simply presents a harrowing story. The final scenes between Bill and the Bride are moving in a way that is atypical of Tarantino's films. I actually cried. Jackie Brown revealed Tarantino's ability to dabble in pathos and sympathy; in Volume 2 he demonstrates that he has become a master of those techniques. It amazes me to think how dissimilar Vols. 1 and 2 are, but it's obvious that they need to be so disparate. The zipping, fanboy references in the first film might be annoying, appearing as if QT is saying look at all the cool movies I've seen. The second contains just as many allusions, but it seems to serve a purpose. Like Finnegan's Wake or Gravity's Rainbow, Kill Bill (as a whole) occupies an interesting level of artistic achievement--a creation that acknowledges all artistry and allows it to bleed into and out of its narrative at will. Kill Bill is, if nothing else, a compendium of late 20th century culture, and a brilliantly realized one at that. Kill Bill is the world that existed between 1950 and 1999, and that's an achievement.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
253,EddyTheMartian007,The character development needed for the first movie. (Minor Spoilers),8,3 February 2019,"(Minor Spoilers) The Second Part Of Kill Bill is one of the rare sequels which is better than the original in almost every way. This movie is very different to the original having almost no action, and having a much slower pace. Instead of focusing on the great action from the first part, it builds the world more, and its characters.I think Uma Thurman had a really great performance in some specific scenes. Most of the actors do a great job. The highlights for me were definitely Bill (David Carradine), Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah). I did think one of the scenes with Elle Driver was really over acted, to a point were it felt silly, and overly melodramatic, it was honestly a little funny. I mean her reaction makes sense, but she took it a few steps too far. Also Pai Mei (Chia-Hui Liu) wasn't very good in my opinion. Bill has this weird charm to him, but you still hate him. I thought it was done well. Budd was one of my favorites. He isn't over the top like all the other characters. He's the most believable with clear motivations.The movie had less plot convenience than the first one. The Bride didn't win because she was lucky this time, she won because of her skills. I still don't understand how she became so skilled. I mean the flashbacks to her training didn't really do much to prove to me that she became master at martial arts. Also I think some of the techniques Pai Mei taught her were really silly. I mean one of them worked, but the other one just made the fight seem underwhelming. What I really did like was that in the last movie she gets shot (or a knife thrown at her) twice, and it barely misses her, but in this movie she does get shot in one scene. However there's still a ton of plot convenience. Like in the first movie the world makes no sense. There's a snake that only attacks one person, gun shots that don't wake people up, someone with the intent of killing not killing the character when they have the chance. There weren't as many big examples as the first one, but it still annoys me. I mean some suspension of disbelief is fine, but honestly when there's so much it really annoys me.There were a few scenes that were setting up some of the characters, but in a movie where we won't really see these characters for too long, it's felt unnecessary. I mean we could've used this time to better set up The Bride's past, or some more action. Also the bleeping Of The Bride's name made no sense. It isn't really a big reveal, the name bleeping does nothing. I spoiled the name for myself since the beginning and it didn't affect the story at all. I did however really enjoy how Bill manipulated The Bride at the end. It's a really smart idea.I do have to say though, this movie has just better character development, and the narrative. While the first one excelled in the action, I think this one had much better character moments. It's also more creative with its directing, and now the story progresses. We really do see the effects of Bill on everyone even more. The world is expanded on even more. I also do have to say this movie has some great lines.Overall I think this movie is better than the first one. Quentin Tarantino does a even better job directing here. There were some great shots, and some nice cinematography. The characters aren't as over the top (for the most part), more fleshed out, and believable. Uma Thurman has a really great performance, and I think the story wraps up nicely (despite the underwhelming final fight). My biggest issue is again how silly, and convenient the movie can be in some parts, but also the lack of action. I mean don't get me wrong I'd rather have good character moments than action, but there's only really 1 good fight and that's it. It also drags a little in the beginning. Regardless this is a better movie narratively, and I did enjoy it. I do still think this movie is a tad overrated though.7.7/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
254,dhaufrect,Directorial Masterpiece,10,25 April 2004,"""Kill Bill, Vol.2"" is another masterpiece by Quentin Tarantino.  His artistic application of brutal violence is mellowed by the ballet like choreography.  There are few directors who can get away with this extreme violence, and yet attract the interest of the broad public.  His cinematography is unsurpassed by most such film genre.  Uma Thurman gives a stellar performance as Beatrix once again.  Darryl Hannah as Elle is a very strong character, and she is the antithesis of what one would expect.  David Carradine portrays an intense Bill, the Snake, and it is refreshing to see him in this difficult role.  It is not a film for the weak at heart or the squeemish, however, it fulfills the complete cycle of the ""Kill Bill"" story is a satisfying manner.  It is a must see for the film buff.  It must be seen on the big screen to appreciate the color and the breathtaking desert views.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
255,Jonathon_Natsis,Who says sequels are always worse?,9,2 February 2011,"Volume Two picks up precisely where Volume One concludes on a cliffhanger, and it is necessary to have seen the first one in order to follow the plot. Naturally, Tarantino, Thurman and Carradine return to wrap up the saga of revenge and violence, accompanied by Michael Madsen (another of Tarantino's favourites) and Daryl Hannah, both of whom are positively given additional screen time in this film.Having already crossed two members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad off her hit list, we follow the Bride as she travels to a desert caravan park to confront Bill's brother Bud and fellow assassin Elle, who just happens to be Bill's newest lover. Sadly, she does so without the use of her beloved Pussy Wagon which (if I may make a pop culture reference of my own) we can assume was stolen by Lady Gaga. From there, she makes her way to Bill himself, where she makes a startling discovery that stands to challenge her motives entirely. I mentioned at the beginning of the first review that to cover both volumes in a single document would be a tough ask due to the overt differences between the two. While Volume Two contains the violence expected from a film of this genre, it is nowhere near as gratuitous as the original, which sought primarily to reference the kung-fu genre in an exploitative sense.Instead, Volume Two is somewhat more insightful and makes an effort to question the very nature of violence, and whether or not it is warranted in different circumstances. Anybody expecting the same scale of bloodshed as its predecessor will leave disappointed as the action in this film, while enjoyable, is severely unpleasant and never without consequence.Tarantino delivers some of his best work in terms of both dialogue and set pieces with this pseudo-sequel. Apart from what could be considered an unnecessary opening scene in which The Bride breaks the fourth wall only to state the explicitly obvious, there are virtually no other instances where any character's lines feel either forced or lazily written. Madsen's perfect delivery of 'that woman deserves her revenge andwe deserve to die' and Bill's well- crafted monologue about mortality during the climax not only sum up the themes of the film neatly, but are also indicators that QT is back on his game in the screenplay department.The extremely claustrophobic scene in which Bud (Madsen) buries The Bride alive is nothing short of terrifying, and is right up there with the Velociraptors in the kitchen (Jurassic Park) and Vito's assassination of Don Fanucci (The Godfather: Part 2) as one of my all-time favourite scenes. The training session with Pai Mei showcasing the origins of The Bride's development into a professional assassin is more than just an entertaining set piece; it is a film-within-a-film, and should be treated accordingly. Where some may view it as a major disruption to the story, I feel this was Tarantino's intention in an effort to further emphasise the film's exploitation angle.Where violence is lacking, it is replaced by the development of genuinely interesting characters, accommodating a unique screenplay and fitting comfortably within the slower pace of this film when compared to Volume One. With such a complete and satisfying ending, confirmed rumours of a third instalment scream of a Miramax cash-grab.

I just don't get some of the other reviews which herald Quentin as the Ali-Baba of cinema. I'd say he's more like one of those guys from ""Dude, Where's My Car"" who watched waaaaayyyy too many samurai films as a teenager.I won't disparage Uma Thurman or David Caradine for their continued roles, as they had to be committed a second time, although why Tarantino broke the film into two is beyond understanding. I will say I am surprised that Thurman and Caradine agreed to do this film in the first place. Maybe Caradine feels he's getting washed up or had some fantasy of playing an evil ""Grasshopper"". As for Uma, I think she put too much faith in Quentin after their time together in Pulp Fiction, which I enjoyed despite its taste for gross violence. This film takes the same idea of violence but then dubs in ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" into it. Thank heavens Quentin didn't ask Travolta or Jackson to show up as ninja bandits! And again, we have the philosophical mumbo-jumbo mixed in amongst expletives delivered in an silly macho tone. I guess the only good thing I can say for the sequel was the same thing I said for the first film, it has good action, albeit this one has a lot less. Sorry, their isn't another Crazy 88's fight.

258,Barky44,Not as good as the first,7,9 December 2005,"While I thought Kill Bill Vol. 1 was a tremendously entertaining film, I was less than enthusiastic about Vol. 2.Problem #1 was the casting and performance of Darryl Hannah as the second-ranking assassin under Bill. I just didn't find her particularly interesting or menacing. True, she was dispatched with aplomb, but it wasn't that enjoyable. Perhaps it was her set-up: in the first film the final ""baddie"" was a leader of the Japanese Mafia, someone who not only had to be tracked but who had a cadre of obstacles protecting her. This built up great tension and excitement and made the payoff fight more interesting. Darryl Hannah's character didn't have that big build-up, there wasn't much of a reason for her to be menacing at all.Problem #2 was the unsatisfying way the final confrontation with Bill was portrayed. To me, it was a let down. Sure, how he finally meets the Bride is a bit surprising, but again, there was very little menace in that confrontation. Tarantino makes a great choice virtually eliminating the violence by that last encounter (by then you tire of it and want something different), but his attempt at bad-guy ""mind games"" falls way flat, becomes uninteresting, and lets the viewer down.Sure, there's some good stuff in this film, the best being The Bride's training under the ancient Kung Fu master.

Tarantinos' film-making is poetry - he does not rely on one genre or another, one style or another, one film or another. He is able to thank all of his own muses individually, while remaining a unique screenwriter and director with something important to say on screen. Characters that would otherwise be ridiculous, actors that are often sub-par, dialogue that could be boring as hell - he brings it all to LIFE in a way that VERY FEW directors are capable of doing. He is a Kurosawa, an Attenborough, a Spielberg of our time - a true cinematic artist. And in thirty years, when everyone forgets that The Alamo or Hidalgo ever existed, Kill Bill will be regarded by film fans and scholars alike as one of the very best of its era - and will likely be paid tribute by the dynamos of the future just as Tarantino gives a salute to his idols.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
262,niaz_islam,Absurd: Vol. 2,3,5 June 2020,As the title says the mission is to kill Bill at any cost. But on the way to killing him reality and logic was murdered.The acting of the characters was very pretentious throughout the film. Even the powerful actors and actresses looked foolish because of the mixture of conflicting extreme emotions. And the story premise made the main character invincible whenever needed and other times she was extremely vulnerable. And the build up with the dialogues were not followed by a strong scenes or actions.This type movie always lacks logic and have plot holes. But it lacked basic level of logic and abundant with plot holes. With a better script this movie could have reached the current highly overrated rating (8).Not recommended.,Kill Bill - Vol. 2

But this one reigns over it in style, dialogue and growth and development. you feel for the charachters as you witness their transformations. tarantino proves that he's truly talented and has a knack for origiality. the film's plotline is basic she's in search of her final 3 oof the death list 5. The people that murdered her friends and tried to murder her and her baby. However the cliffhanger at the end of the first one left the audience knowig her daughter was still alive. overloaded with wondeful comedy, clever dialogue, excellent performances, and intelligent and stylish direction this vol. 2 will stand the test of time. it's already a legend much like the title charachter's story.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Although Vol. 2 has less action than the previous film, I want to say that I love the way the action and fight scenes worked with their environment in such a nice way. Vol. 2 also has a lot more dialogue and person-to-person interactions that give you the opportunity to learn and care much more about our protagonist, her past, and her trainings. It even leads up to a beautiful climax and an emotional send-off.
All together, everything in Vol. 1 you can expect in Vol. 2, with a little less action but more character building and dialogue and a heart touching ending that will make these films rewatchable for years and years to come.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
269,joshi_3592,"It actually makes the first film seem bad in comparison (not that it's bad, but you know what I mean)",10,9 July 2010,"I can't believe some people said that this was worse than Kill Bill volume 1. This is honestly much better than the first film. It actually makes the first film seem bad in comparison, not that it is bad but you know what mean. Kill Bill volume one was great. It had a few moment that I didn't like but it was anything but bad. Kill Bill volume 2 hits the spot perfectly. It really summarizes most, if not everything that I look for in a ""good"" movie. It has cliché's, but that's the point. And they're played out excellently. It has that campy feel to it, a common trade in Tarantino's films. It even has a few 70's kung-fu moments which I just loved seeing. I admire Tarantinos love for classic cinema (or retro might be a better word). This movie unlike the first one has a few funny moments, but still manage to stay serious. And I mean that, it is a serious film. but then again, what revenge movie isn't. And I must say I really loved the ending. It surprised me as well, which is a rare thing to happen. I was sort of moved, or at least intrigued by the ending, and for that I am very happy, because that is such a rare thing.So why is it better than Kill Bill volume 1? Well, I'll it's longer, hence manage to build up a better and more variable story. Secondly, I like the character better,a nd we finally get to see Bill. So I must say, Kill Bill volume 1 serve as an introduction, so Kil Bill volume 1 is what makes Kill Bill volume 2 so much better, because now we know what's going one. And third, if you for any reason should have read my review for Kill Bill volume 1, you would know that I criticized it's violence. I'm not against violence in any way, in fact it is important in many films. This is one of them. Unlike Kill Bill volume 1, Kill Bill volume 2 is not focused on the violence, butt he story. The violence supports the story, not the other way around. I understand Tarantino was trying to make a kind of anime live-action movie, interesting idea, but I felt it was over the top. Think bad of me if you wan't. But this movie, ditch that idea, and I could enjoy the movie, and even it's more violent scenes.So what more can I say? I finished the Kill Bill volume 1 review by saying I'm looking forward to Kill Bill volume 2. Well I love this film. it should be considered a cinematic masterpiece, and is probably already a classic. 10/10.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

271,jazzest,Explanation that Eclipses Brilliant Vol. 1,5,27 May 2004,"The second half of this gigantic homage collage piece turns out to serve as an explanation for the unrevealed background of Vol. 1. In many cases, unresolved mysteries hold the viewers' interests by making them keep guessing, while resolutions are rarely satisfying. Kill Bill is no exception; the plain excuse for The Massacre at Twin Pines even eclipses the brilliant Vol. 1. The odyssey of Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) concludes with the poorly executed family drama, where Thurman and David Carradine seem totally lost. Extreme close-ups (of both characters' faces and objects) look cliched and lose their impact when overused.The four-hour epic (combining Vol. 1 and 2) may be more suitable for TV; each chapter has a decent content to comprise a decent series.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

The sequel to the gore-fest Kill Bill volume 1 returns with revenge and discipline. The Bride (Thurman) seeks again to quench her thirst of the blood from the three remaining assassins that shot her around four years ago. This time she aims to kill Bill's redneck brother Budd (Madsen), Bill's new lady friend Elle Driver (Hannah), and the mastermind of evil Bill himself (Caradine).I myself thought that the second one was not as good or gory as the first one. A surprisingly good sequel, once again the black and white was Tarantino-like. Meaning superb and a classical technique in the hands of Quentin. I'll admit the movie had it's high points but I thought they did to much talking. Unlike the first where she was jumping around with her Hattori Hanzo sword killing people left and right. The fight adviser Yuen Woo-Ping returns to help out in the fight scenes this time winning them the Best Choreographed Fight of 2004. But never the less a disappointing and yet at the same time a surprisingly good movie. My final rating 7/10.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
273,Blade_Le_Flambeur,"Quentin Tarantino falls once again, a sub par continuation of an exciting film",5,23 December 2004,"Writer/ Director Quentin Tarantino (Reservoir Dogs, Jackie Brown) continues his story from 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1', an exciting action/ adventure film that chronicles the revenge of The Bride (Uma Thurman) as she seeks to find those whom she used to trust and those who put her into a comma for four years. In Vol. 1, The Bride dispatched O - Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu), Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) and the Crazy 88 fighters. In 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' the story continues as she seeks to find and kill Budd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and of course Bill (David Carradine), ending her rampage.Tarantino created an exciting, action packed explosive piece of cinema with 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' by using slick cinematography/ editing and combining several highly memorable action sequences with a cool story. Instead of choosing to make a film with similar style as Vol. 1, in 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' Tarantino opts to make the film more plot orientated and dig deeper into the characters. Flashbacks are used a few times to develop the relationships between characters that once was, in particular The Bride and Bill at the wedding rehearsal. However, Tarantino is ultimately dogged by his murky screenplay and timid direction that fails to truly grab a theme and hold onto it. There is a dizzy and very spectacular fight scene in a trailer between Elle and The Bride, and a humorous flashback to The Bride's training by Pai Mei (Gordon Liu). However, these action scenes aren't enough to make the film interesting and it becomes purely dull. It is discovered in the very end of 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' that The Bride's daughter is still alive, and in Vol. 2 they finally meet and try to form a bond. Bill finally is shown and developed. But it seems Tarantino was trying to go two places at once, and was trying to make an action piece and a drama at the same time.Tarantino has always had a knack for making films with slang filled dialog, and stylish criminal characters. Bill is the culmination of Tarantino's style, particularly a scene in which he delivers a monologue about his thoughts on Superman. While Carradine definitely has some cool to him, the dialog ends up falling flat to the ground and it seems the depth, or whatever it was Tarantino was trying to achieve was totally lost. The film feels boring and patchy, instead of the tight focus Tarantino employed with 'Kill Bill: Vol. 1', Vol. 2 is by comparison much weaker and much more disconnected. The Bride is given more to do than simply fight this time, and she is asked to finally show more human emotions. Unfortunately, Thurman isn't half able to pull this off. While her grim emotions were perfect in Vol. 1, Tarantino gives her more to do but she is just incapable. One scene asks for her to be crying on the floor in a bathroom, and I couldn't help but laugh. She simply lacks the ability to perform. Carradine, as mentioned previously definitely has style but the murky screenplay doesn't give him the ability to really use it to full potential. Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah are appropriate in their roles, particularly Hannah as the fork tongued bitch Elle. The usual sharp performances Tarantino gets from his actors is lost, and there is no one to blame but him. The film employs some sharp visuals as well, thanks to ace director of photography Robert Richardson (JFK), but visuals aren't as important to the story as they were in Vol. 1.I give some credit to 'Kill Bill: Vol. 2'. There are some exciting moments in the film, and Carradine is able to give off some nice moments. But the flat screenplay by Quentin Tarantino and his unfocused direction break the film apart.5.5/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
274,udeaasykle,Put this together with Kill Bill Volume 1 and you have yourself a winner!,8,26 April 2004,"This movie is not as violent as the first one but it is somewhat more interesting. Much more dialog and much more character building. In this you get to see how Uma is trained by an old monk called Pai Mei and other stuff i wont mention because i don't want to ruin the movie experience for you. After you see this movie and put the two together you will know why i love Terantino's movies. Every single one of them. This movie is about revenge, pure and simple. The only time during this movie that i even looked at my watch was in the end when Bill and The Bride is talking to eachother... Other than that this is an excellent movie. Favorite memorable quote: Elle Driver: That's right. I killed your master.

275,gcrokus,All Eyes On Darryl,9,21 May 2004,"I have never seen Splash, nor can I even recall Darryl all that well in her early years.  But mama look at her now.  Uma Thurman in the same get up as Elle Driver wouldn't cut it; there aren't a handful of women, not discounting Hollywood actresses that could pull off what Darryl does here.  She is the best villainess we've seen, perhaps ever.  Never warmed by Uma, I am a fan of hers now.  She indeed shows us talent we never expected or frankly even demanded.  Usually the most wooden of actresses, she redeems all her career just speaking to us through the windshield of her car as the movie opens.  But she is never as riveting as her co-star; Ms. Hannah is a total showstopper in every frame in which she is visible, and that includes phone calls.  This by way of introducing THE FIGHT.  When Uma and Darryl have at it, as we hope they will, all girlfights ever recorded are left in Mohave trailer dust.  Even the superior opening fight of Vol. I pales in comparison to this frenetic kinetic combat.  We've never seen anything like this.  And so it goes for all of the film.  Interspersing humor, raw violence and quiet introspective minimalist dialog we get a stew of visual and aural greatness.  Of course this movie is all about style.  Why would you want or expect otherwise from a Tarantino flik?  None in the audience spoke, looked at their watch or even wiggled.

It was still good although did not quite live up to what I was wanting.This movie plays more on the arduous pursuit of Bill that requires patience instead of slashing your way through the bad guys.I enjoyed the Uma Thurman training which pays homage to many great kung fu movies of past.As in all Tarantino movies Madsen's character is good at being bad. And I also enjoyed the fight between Daryl Hannah and Uma Thurman.But this movie was missing a major fight scene.

I did enjoy this one slightly more than volume 1 simply because of the depth added to the main characters. Bill, especially, was an astoundingly fascinating character.

278,Dello_,Better than the great vol.1,9,9 January 2020,"""Kill Bill vol.2"" is clearly the second part of a long single movie but is very very different in tone and in the scope than the vol.1. Indeed the first one is more action oriented and more fun, especially with its over-the-top violent fights but the second part is deeper and more emotional. And if the vol.1 was so memorable in terms of action, vol.2 has great dialogues that are now printed in my head (and in particular the last one). And I'm not implying that this movie doesn't contain some great duels, because it surely does, but I preferred this more narrative oriented style and the overall messages and theme explored by this vol.2. And in all of that I found the finale very satisfying, a perfect pay off to the previous four hours. The movies (vol.1 and 2) works so well because all the characters are greatly characterised and were always intriguing and I was interested in watching how they would have evolved in the story. I've already talked about the dialogues but I want to underline them again because they were fantastic and I feel I could have watched two hours of people talking about how to open a bottle of water and still being entertained.

282,secragt,More Soul But Not A Stand-Alone Movie,8,31 May 2004,"This should have been a single movie rather than two truncated mini-movies. It seems Q agrees because he places the credits with all of the actors at the end (including mini-clips from part I), and we realize how very, very many things aren't in this second part. It's a shame, because Kill Bill 2 is more thoughtful and fleshes out the plot, with backstories on The Bride and Bill and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) characters, as well as meaningful dialogue explaining the bloodbath of the first movie. But it needed an editor to chop down the words. Just as the first movie needed an editor to chop down the fight sequences. THE MATRIX 2 and 3 taught us that more Agent Smiths and bigger, louder, longer fight sequences don't improve things. But if Kill Bill vol. 1 suffers from Matrix 2/3 excesses, Volume 2 suffers from an excess of verbiage and overdone dialogue along the lines of...I dunno, MY DINNER WITH ANDRE? There is too much self-indulgence at work here, and I fear the box office of these two movies is just going to make ""Q""'s next effort that much more baggy and undisciplined.Q has said splitting the movie in two allowed him to keep all the little bits he otherwise would have had to cut, but the truth is, there's a good half hour from part one that should have excised and a good twenty minutes more from part two. The result would have been a roughly three hour standalone movie that would have been tight and eminently watchable in one sitting. Kind of like the Beatles White Album, which would have been their all-time best had it been a single epic-length platter, but because they decided to indulge themselves and throw everything they came up with on the two discs, it's full of classics and crap side by side. Even Kill Bill's music screams of lengthy epics, with Ennio Morricone sprinkled throughout the trailer sequence evoking THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY's monumental breadth. It would have worked as homage and humor in a single movie, but feels out of place and strangely wrong in this split up movie thanks to Miramax's quest for the dollars. To Q's credit, though, the overall music is wonderfully reminiscent of the seventies and chopsocky movies; I suspect he spent a long time putting it together and it is generally effective. Kill Bill Vol. 2 is okay, but is lessened by being separated from Vol. 1. This is the rare movie where the ""Director's Cut"" DVD should have LESS footage and Q + U and HW and M should return KB V I and II into one film, the way it should have been from the start.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

If anyone expects the pace and gore of the first installment, they are very much mistaken! This movie focuses on the bride's revenge against Sidewinder, California Mountain Snake and finally Bill. Uma Thurman proves her range as an actress by showing the struggle of her character's emotional stability. You finally understand why the Deadly Viper Squad were out to destroy the Bride and funnily enough you actually find the character of Bill likeable.

285,Det_McNulty,It Could Have Been Great If It Had More Substance,8,9 July 2006,"I'm a big Quentin Tarantino and seeing all of his films this would have to be my least favourite. Kill Bill: Volume 2 still manages to create a good ending to the self titled ""Roaring Rampage Of Revenge"". Like the first film it lacks the substance needed to gain a higher score, yes the movie is stylish, but the phrase ""Style over substance"" comes to mind. Unlike the first film which was a blood-thirsty satire, the sequel is surprisingly nothing like the first film. It does not contain the same kind of fight scenes as the first film and tends to reply more on the acting and visual flare Much of the movie is stolen, it's supposed to be a tribute. But things such Ennio Morricone's score are stolen as well as some notable others. Unlike other Quentin Tarantino where he wonderfully references cinema this feels more stolen. A lot of the film felt very silly and un-satisfying for example some of the deaths are short which is disappointing seeing as Quentin Tarantino has managed to create really crazy death scenes in his previous masterpieces.Uma Thurman once again steals the show and plays along side great actors like Michael Madsen. Now I'm normally a great fan of Michael Madsen, but this was a different matter. His performance felt clumsy and lacked depth/creativity to his previous past roles. A prime example would be none other than his performance as Mr. Blonde which for me goes down in my own personal favourite movie characters. His performance in Kill Bill: Volume 2 was a different matter. I felt a little unsatisfied after Kill Bill: Volume 2 after being entertained by Volume 1. My favourite scene was probably when Uma Thurman (The Bride) finally met up with Bill and learnt the truth, it was very interesting. I also loved the scene re capturing what happened at the wedding rehearsal it felt very lonely and tranquil with the black and white photography.One thing I did find impressive was the direction, it was very precise and held a lot of detail to the scenery and atmosphere that was in the movie. The movie mixes Spaghetti Western and Samurai Action to create something that is slightly operatic. The movies pace is very different to other films and holds few surprises. People call the movie ""emotional"", I would definitely not say that, I found it more dramatic because it was so over the top. The movie still managed to be a lot deeper than the previous instalment, but still did not live up to Volume 1.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
286,toll-8,Claustrophobic and long winded,6,9 May 2012,"Kill Bill Volume 2 isn't really a sequel. Granted it is called volume 2, but really it is one film that has been split into two. This volume is technically a complete follow on from the first one, so it is highly recommended to watch the first one and then possibly straight into this one. I didn't take on this recommendation so it took me a while to remember the pivotal points in the first one in order to catch up with the second. Do yourself a favour if you are planning on watching this film and watch the original first.Volume 2 begins with the shoot out at the wedding chapel, where the Bride (Thurman) was left for dead by her former team of assassins. This is what sent her on the journey of killing all those involved in her betrayal. In the first one we see her destroying many who were involved and partaking in many huge fight sequences. In this volume we continue on with her journey, with the only three left to be killed; Budd (Madsen), Ellie (Hannah), and Bill (Carradine). Her first target is Budd, who has been warned by Bill that the Bride is on her way. Budd puts in a plan to stop her in her tracks and when his plan seems like it is working it is very disturbing. Basically he begins to bury her alive. Her next target is Ellie and obviously eventually Bill, the man who ultimately betrayed her. On route we see some flashbacks that tie up several plot holes of the first film, and to just why and how she became the big assassin that she is claimed to be.I won't indulge too much into what happens. I'm sure you are all aware that she will plough through them and have her face to face with Bill but it is the way she gains her revenge that is the shock. There is not as much action and violence as there was in the first film but when the action does kick in it is riveting. The Bride and Ellie standoff in a fantastically choreographed fight sequence, and there are some nice touches when the Bride is taught her kung fu by her Master, all pays homage to old school kung fu movies.As well as having action, I also found this film slightly scary. Sounds weird as it isn't a horror, but there are moments that are quite frightening. Claustrophobia is brought to the max here and that is what is scary. At one point the Bride is buried alive and her reactions make you believe you're in there with her, which would make it even more claustrophobic. The sweat dripping off her head helps you feel the heat she is also feeling. Tarantino does a great job of highlighting all this by using minimal light and some tense camera angles. This scene is uncomfortable. Also there is a scene with a poisonous snake which jumps out at you. This is frightening to me as I hate snakes. Watching it slither across the floor and attack helpless victims really spooked me out. The final scary moment is one that will make you grimace. A fight scene culminates in an eyes being gauged out. This also feels claustrophobic as you can just imagine the pitch blackness this person has been plunged into. To me this was horrific. It isn't supposed to be scary but I found it to be at certain points.As I can't really remember the first one I am struggling to really decide on how good this film is. It is alright at times but at other times it becomes slow and has a lot of talking and telling us what is going on. This though is typical Tarantino and a lot of his films do have much time given to character's talking. Not that this is a problem but at times it causes me to drift out of the film. Much of it kept me on the edge of my seat but other parts I lost a little interest.The acting is good in the film, Carradine is excellent as Bill, and Thurman, as well as looking gorgeous, really brings the character to life. The plot is over strung but the acting and camera work help you to ignore this. This is a typical Tarantino film and if you love him this will be a big deal, if you don't then it will probably just be average.3 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
287,Sfpsycho415,Almost as Good As The First Half---7/10,7,26 April 2004,"Kill Bill Vol. 2 kicks some serious ass for almost it's whole running time. The only flaw is the disappointing fight with Bill. But there is so much good stuff here, it's pretty much forgivable. There is the great fight with Elle which tore the house down. Literally. We also finally get to see Budd played by Michael Madsen. His scenes were some of the best in both movies. And then there is quite possibly one of the scariest and most exciting scenes ever involving the Bride being buried alive. Having a fear of suffocation myself, this scene was extra effective.The acting was excellent all around. Uma Thurman proves she is not only hot and deadly, but that she is also one of the best actresses today. She is especially good toward the end. Micheal Madsen is quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. He always gives a great performance. Darryl Hannah is superb as the sole female assassin in Vol.2, and David Carradine is great as Bill himself. It's just too bad we don't get to see some more of his fight skills.

290,thniels,Ginger Rogers with at sword,8,23 April 2004,"First of all, this movie should never have been split in two. It can't be said in less words less a few adverbs and I readily subtract 1 point for molesting it so.As for Uma Thurman she was nothing short of great but first and foremost she was believable. Not stunningly beautiful, nor out of this world gracious. Just plain real. And being that in a role like this is really something else. Not only must it require considerable talent, it also adds a depth to the character seemingly impossible considering the genre which is far from being realistic. As an odd aside, the genre best compared to is that of song-and-dance movies with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers not as one would imagine the tacky kung-fu movies of the seventies. I wonder if my grandma would like it? Distinctly a Quentin Tarantino movie and a good one at that.Thomas Nielsen",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
291,I_Love_Spielberg,"More western really than kung fu, but still good nonetheless",9,13 April 2009,"""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" concludes the Bride's revenge streak. She's already killed two members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Club and she's looking for more, all the way down to Bill. But she's in for a surprise.This was, in my opinion, better than the first in that you had more of a back story on the Bride; how she was able to handle the sword and how she's able to fight. You also have a more inside view on what started the Bride's revenge, what the turn of events were. Yes, it's not as kick-ass violent as the first, but in some ways, that's a good thing. I'm actually kind of happy that Quentin Tarantino didn't get too violent with it, even though it does have its share of violent moments.Overall, if you like the first one, you'll probably like the second one. If not, then oh well. But I do recommend it to anyone who shows interest in it.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

I'm the same age now as Uma was when she filmed these 2 movies and I have so much appreciation for her unique features now. There was nobody better to play this part and the dialogue between her and Bill(David Carradine) had chemistry that you just don't see very often. Every scene they're together captured all my attention so I could just focus in on their acting. The classic Tarantino style is like nothing else.

293,ALauff,The Second Half of Tarantino's Masterpiece,8,23 April 2004,"This is a much more contemplative, somber, and deterministic film than Vol. 1. The tonal disparity can be attributed to the splitting of a completed film into two seemingly dichotomous parts. Critics seem to be ignoring that this is merely the second half of a saga; perceptions of Vol. 2 as being closer to a ""true"" Tarantino film have abounded, with this film being considered a satisfying sequel rather than the plaintive coda it happens to be. Of course it is a tall order to solder the delirious assortment of styles and influences of the first film with the masterly pacing and reflectivity of Tarantino's denouement, but that is part of the unique challenge of Kill Bill, an unwieldy masterpiece that reflects the breakneck referentiality, the encyclopedic knowledge of genre archetypes, and the bewildering love for cinema of its creator.Tarantino's sophistication in knowing when and how to reference his pet influences—kung-fu grind-house flicks of the '70s and spaghetti westerns, most vitally The Good, the Bad and the Ugly—adds immensely to his deft handling of conflict (physical, emotional, psychological) and the mythos of the avenging hero. Occasionally it can be frivolous: I could have done without the beard-stroking of the talismanic sensei, but it was an inconsequential irritant, a jest to the B-level qualities of the source material. Those who use self-indulgence as an open-and-closed criticism of this film and its maker are missing the point: Kill Bill is a catalogue of obsessions and an indulgent pastiche, yes, but it's also deeply considerate and generous to its audience, couching the more obscurantist elements and tendencies in recognizable and skillfully rendered cinematic language. Listening to some people talk, you'd think Tarantino committed a mortal sin by opening a portal to his brain. That it's mediated by some very empathetic performances (Uma Thurman, in particular, is a marvel: she endures physical and emotional highs and lows in the most rigorous and touching ways), and his most restrained screenplay yet, proves his interest in tapping into a more challenging aesthetic beyond that of fan-boy élan (something that still rankles me about Pulp Fiction).In this latter half, themes of fatalism and penance—briefly touched on in O-Ren's dying contrition—hang over certain of The Bride's waiting victims, creating in Budd (Michael Madsen) something of a purgatorial void of guilt and regret. He works as a bouncer at a vacant saloon, enduring abuse and mockery from his obnoxious, drug-running boss; he spends the evenings pulling on a bottle of Jameson and crooning to Johnny Cash. And yet, despite his concession that the Bride ""deserves her revenge and we all deserve to die,"" he doesn't exactly surrender or give in when she comes calling. Why? There is an extraordinary, digressing monologue delivered by Bill late in the film that is as effective as any high-noon showdown in elucidating the warrior's existential code of fighting even when there is nothing worth fighting for. These are tough, spirit-deadened men, acting on instinct alone. The women are a different matter entirely: Elle (Darryl Hannah), for her part, yearns for battle, desiring the Bride to ""suffer until her final breath,"" but respecting her as a peerless combatant. And I don't remember Vernita or O-Ren having much empathy, despite one mothering a child of her own and the other a victim of unspeakable childhood tragedy (the maverick anime insert, which may still be Kill Bill's most disturbing sequence). These are women largely without conscience, embracing their dark natures, masculine counterparts to the apprehensive men.Overall, I believe it to be a tricky proposition to link fluidly the two volumes—the tonal disparity remarked upon earlier could just as well be the effect of re-ordering and re-cutting scenes in post-production to reflect two separate films, the first more compressed and violent to entice audiences to see the second, illuminating volume. A best-case scenario would be for Miramax and Tarantino to release the film in its original state (as a third DVD along with the two individual volumes in a box set) to reflect what it was before it had to carry the weight of two feature films. Then we would have a true rarity: a chance for filmgoers to see if marketers and bean counters truly know what's best for them.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
294,matlefebvre20,...if you watch the first volume,6,16 June 2007,"I still have difficulties to believe that this insipid and ordinary dish is the sequel of the ultra-spicy and tasty ""Kill Bill Vol. 1"".With the incredible spectacle shown in the first part of this epic four-hour-plus movie, my expectations were very high for this sequel and conclusion. Perhaps that it's just me, but maybe I've put the bar too high. Or perhaps that Quentin himself did with the blood pool of the first volume.At the end of the first volume, The Bride (Uma Thurman) already killed Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu). So there were only Budd (Michael Madsen), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and her boss Bill (David Carradine) to annihilate.The major difference is that director Quentin Tarantino visibly gave a more conventional taste to the second volume. And if there's one character trait that QT doesn't own, it's the fact of being conventional. It's almost like if somebody slapped him on the fingers while lecturing him of calm himself and behave better. Anyway, if it's the case, I'd really like to meet that person and tell him/her my way of thinking.This section of The Bride's story (who must be called by her real name Beatrix Kiddo) began pretty well however. The black-and-white opening about the church where the initial massacre happened is original and the massacre itself is never really shown, which gives a ""Reservoir Dogs"" taste (it happens to be the movie in which Madsen plays the greatest role of his career).The fact that the shootout happened in a church during a wedding repetition acts like some kind of sacrilege. Just like the katana duel in the snow-covered Japanese garden in the first movie.Like always, Tarantino tries to pay homage to many film genres in the course of the same feature-length film. But here, it doesn't work very well when you compare to his other movies. The first part, which is supposed to pay tribute to the spaghetti westerns from Sergio Leone, falls short. And there's one good reason for that. The word 'spaghetti' hasn't been taken just like that. That precise word is used because of the supposedly huge amount of blood shown on-screen. But it seems that we're running out of currant juice. Moreover, the cinematography is supposed to be minimalistic, which is not the case here either. Images are not elaborated nor especially stylized, but they're not minimalistic either. Tarantino can try to include samples from Ennio Morricone on the soundtrack, it doesn't improve the situation.There's an obvious reference to the zombie films of George A. Romero which almost becomes a moment of unintentional comedy.While Volume 1 was definitely based on the presentation, Volume 2 is definitely aimed at character development and at moments of introspection and souvenirs. It's probably that brutal change of tone that is so uncomfortable.But it nevertheless benefits to some actors. Carradine impresses, not necessarily by his performance by itself, but by his capacity to remember so many lines and so many monologues by heart.Hannah is the most frightening killer of the group, because of her dirty character, her menacing face and her sinister blindfold above her right eye. Her fight with Thurman is exciting and the scene where Thurman pulls out her remaining eye is very hard to stomach and remains the most powerful image of this portion of movie.And we know at which point Tarantino is far from being sentimental. However, the scenes where Beatrix appears with her daughter (which Beatrix thought of being dead) are surprising and comforting.Now I'd like to go back to Carradine's monologues. It's true that the characters talk much more than they fight in this second volume. Some people would even say that it's another Tarantino trademark and that it's the point that made ""Pulp Fiction"" so interesting. However, here, characters are rather boring and their conversations are not very catchy. Let's say that Bill's superhero speech is far from the level of the famous ""Royale with cheese"" of Vincent Vega.On the cinematography level, there are not many things to underline. There's only the first chapter, entirely in black-and-white, and the scene from inside the coffin that are really interesting.To sum up, almost all of the publicity and the fame of ""Kill Bill"" are built around the first volume. Volume 2 is good nevertheless, but we could compare the effect to a cold shower poured on a burning body. If both sections are put together, it would enhance the second part, but it would risk to harm the first one. And obviously, because we're so impressed by the first part, we desperately want to watch the second one. But what do you want...",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Budget $30 million USD [2] All Movie Guide profile IMDb profile A few minutes before the events that open the first volume, Bill (Carradine) tracks down The Bride and her friends as they are gathered for her wedding rehearsal. He is polite and mild-mannered, and even consents to being introduced to the groom as her father. She takes her place at the altar as the other four Deadly Vipers arrive at the chapel, weapons in tow, to kill everyone at the rehearsal.In the present, Bill ventures to the California desert to talk to his brother Budd, aka ""Sidewinder"" (Madsen), another former Deadly Viper. Bill warns him that The Bride will come for him next. Budd, now overweight and alcoholic, has put his assassin days behind him, lives in a trailer and works as a bouncer at a local strip club and has lost his former respect to his new boss.The Bride arrives at Budd's trailer that night to take his life. Anticipating her entry, Budd shoots her in the chest with rock salt the moment she opens his door, then injects her with a sedative. Budd calls Driver and offers to sell her The Bride's Hanzo sword for one million dollars. The Bride is buried alive by Budd.As she lies in her grave, The Bride remembers her early training in China, when Bill took her to the temple of legendary martial arts master Pai Mei (an intentionally classic example of the elderly martial arts master stock character). He uses cruelty as a tool for discipline and obedience. Although he ""hates Caucasians, despises Americans and has nothing but contempt for women"", he takes The Bride in. Her training was extremely rigorous, and she endured many hardships, but she became a formidable warrior under his tutelage. In the present, The Bride calls on Pai Mei's training to break out of the coffin and claw her way up to freedom.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
298,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Review of Kill Bill (Volume II),9,27 April 2004,"`Revenge is a dish best served cold.'When we last left off, Quentin Tarantino has re-emerged onto the Hollywood scene for the first time in six years with not just one but two films to be released into theaters to an overwhelmingly awaiting cult audience. But not everyone was especially happy with the decision of both Tarantino and his distributor, Miramax Pictures, to split the tale of The Bride in two. There were some in the vast assortment of captious movie-goers that took this as a sign of continued greed amongst the `Hollywood elite' in that the decision of splitting the film into two parts was done to get the loyal fans to shell-out double the normal ticket price for essentially one film. Granted, in the end, that turned out not to be the case, as the film would actually be five hours in length and thus be deemed too long to be taken all at once, but the issue still remained whether the rest of Hollywood would follow in the foot-steps of Kill Bill and spark a brand new trend, only this time with less honorable then Tarantino did. That is still to be seen and perhaps that argument is a bit overzealous . In this situation, one shouldn't question what could happen in the future but whether or not the primary influence, namely Kill Bill, did what it claimed it would accomplish, by delivering movie-goers ultimate satisfaction for dollar.Kill Bill (Volume II) is the second, and possibly final, installment of the story that centers on a former member of a group of assassins who seeks revenge for the actions done on to her by her former colleagues. For those unfamiliar with the first installment, here is a slight recap of previous events:A woman known only as The Bride has waken up from a four year comma after her former boss Bill left her for dead on the day of her wedding killing her fiancé, the wedding party and her unborn child. Unfortunately for the skilled assassin, he made one big mistake: he failed to kill her. Now that she has awakened from her living slumber, The Bride will travel the world picking off her attempted killers one by one including the mysterious Bill. First up on her list is O-Ren Ishi, aka Cottonmouth, and her group of Japanese underground assassins and then Vernita Green, aka Copperhead. Upon completing the task of killing her first two targets, The Bride continues on her rampage determined to kill everyone on her list, all the way to Bill.The second installment picks up basically where the first one left off, leaving The Bride heading to her next target, Budd (aka Sidewinder), who happens to be the run-down and vastly inferior brother of Bill himself. But, for at least a few moments, Budd gets the upper-hand on the film's lead assassin by placing her in a coffin and burring her alive. In the time it takes her to escape, the audience is informed on the vast training The Bride took in order to become the superior apache she is today. Upon escaping the make-shift grave, The Bride duels with her contemporary rival, Elle Driver (aka California Mountain Snake), who not only killed Pai Mai but has her eyes set on The Bride herself. The final lag of her journey brings her to the home of Bill himself and along with him comes a little surprise: her daughter. The story for Kill Bill (Volume II) is quite arguably vastly superior to the one written up for the first installment in that this one deals not so much with action but dialogue and meanings discovered behind actions made by characters throughout this film as well as the previous installment. Once again Tarantino demonstrates his remarkable filmmaking skills by back-tracking the story at precise moments that by doing so will explain actions yet to come. Few writers can pull such an effect successful and Tarantino does so brilliantly.As was said with the previous installment, a relative bunch of low-profile actors and actresses make up one of the better casts of the year for this film, but this time around we introduced to a slightly different lot from the last film. Michael Madsen gives a dead-on (no pun intended) performance as Budd, a run-down and subjacent version of his former self now that he is no longer in the hit-man business. Madsen gives a sense that the character really contemplates on what he has done and whether or not he feels remorse for those actions but at the same time showcases the scoundrel that still lives within him. Daryl Hannah is quite intriguing as Elle Driver, clearly the most ruthless and baneful character in the film series. The only problem with her role was the dreadfully over-the-top performance given when her character's eye was plucked out. Granted having one's eye plucked out isn't a pleasant manner but what Hannah presented on screen was unconvincing and quite annoying after some time. Uma Thurman's role in the second installment can't be complimented more then her role in the first . She gives an absolutely brilliant, witty, and exhilarating performance that works every moment she is on screen. And David Carradine, best known for his Kung Fu television series, gives a `sweet', vibrant, and utterly perfect performance as the title character, Bill. He shines in every scenes he is presented in and works exceedingly well with Uma Thurman . There isn't much to say other then `Bravo'!Overall, Kill Bill plays out much like the concept of revenge itself - actions and instincts engulf us at first, but as time goes on and the journey rampages toward its ultimate conclusion, truth and meaning quickly take over. Where Tarantino starts off with a bang, he rightfully finishes off with a shock to our system - maturity and philosophical contemplation on the subject of revenge and what it means for those involved. Those who were truly engulfed by the blood and gut spilling actions of the first film will be greatly disappointed by the second installment unless you are one of those geeks who enjoy dialogue far more then comical violence, which may not be too many. But if there is even just a few then that will demonstrate the true essence of maturity amongst the movie-going public. Despite a pacing that made the feature feel a tad longer then was probably necessary, Kill Bill (Volume II) serves as a fitting conclusion to Quentin Tarantino's near perfect masterpiece . a masterpiece that may take quite some time to surpass but if the young filmmaker keeps putting out work like his previous films, his cult audience is more then willing to wait.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

This movie would perhaps have worked better as a computer game.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
300,charlessmith702210,A continuation of the avenging of a near-assassination attempt on the Bride,9,5 May 2013,"It is good that Quentin Tarantino in the original Kill Bill (vol. 1) used flashbacks, especially the one about O-Ren Ishii's background. Now, in the sequel to this action movie, Beatrix Kiddo, who already had killed 2 assassins and went back home from her Japanese trip, is out to take out 2 more in Kill Bill Vol. 2, because the assassination squad was a quartet of 4 killers. Flashbacks in vol. 2 are almost as similar in number as Vol. 1. One flashback focuses on the squad entering the church--then you hear the machine gun fire, but you don't see what happens. Why? Tarantino did not want to have a cliché of the assassination of the 9 innocent victims of the wedding party...so focus was on an exterior shot, not interior because the give-away of the assassination squad church killing already had happened in Vol. 1.There are several new things that should point out during this sequel.Pai Mei was something like a drill instructor in Shaolin kung-fu when he subjected Beatrix to the difficult martial art. So there is an allusion to the ""Mortal Kombat"" movie that featured an almost similar Shaolin monk character...and some of the other Chinese martial art flicks of the B-variety, especially in the Bruce Lee era.And then, there was Budd's house. Elle, who is a cross between a pirate and a secretary, comes in with the mob payment to Budd for the burying alive of Beatrix Kiddo..a treasure chest of, I guess, $250,000 in cash. But an ugly surprise came as Budd was going deep into that cash in the box...a black mamba snake bolts out and bites Budd about several times. Budd then tries to fight back at Elle but the venom from the bites quickly do its work and he collapses. Budd slowly falls to his death as Elle explains the facts about the black mamba--which could remind one person about the king cobra snake, which can be as deadly in its bites as the former mamba. So basically, Elle killed Budd so she can run off with the mob money. Then, as Elle calls Bill to lie about Budd's death, saying that it was an accident--Beatrix rushes into Budd's compound and it is a duel to the death--a cat fight filled with martial arts moves. The last part of the fight is in 2 stages. Stage 1 is the flashback where Elle mentions why she killed master Pai Mei..she poisoned the fish that Pai ate, and also--because Pai Mei slashed one of Elle's eyes with his sword. Then Stage 2 comes in, and with Beatrix saying to Elle, ""You have no future"", the final fight is now with samurai swords...but the fight was brief, Beatrix stops Elle's sword with a holding defense...and targeting Elle's remaining good eye, executes a very fast chicken-beak move (likely inspired by Pai Mei), pulling out that eye and rendering Elle completely blind as she goes crazy, haphazardly destroying things around the house. To add to the insult, she crushes Elle's pulled good eye with her foot, and she even manages to tame the black mamba's provoking stance so that the snake would not bite her...as she leaves Budd's house for good. Elle doesn't die but to Beatrix, the eye take-out is almost like what death looks like, so Beatrix does her job...she did not need to further finish off Elle.The final conflict in Bill's mansion was something. Just before the vital point coup-de-grace strike on Bill's heart (which would be called ""kyushu"" in kyokushin karate), the setup for this was several gauntlets that Beatrix had to go through. One of them was Bill's pistol, and then a surprise pistol shot with a truth serum dart that went right in one of Beatrix's legs. Fortunately that serum did not kill her as Bill interrogates her, and finally, Bill lets him take out the truth serum dart. Then, Bill tells Beatrix by verbal intimidation that because she did not kill her child, she will be sentenced to death by Bill himself. Then after a brief samurai sword fight--this set-up that 5-point Pai Mei strike. Bill falls to the lawn and dies after Beatrix's last words to him...""You look ready."" Once Bill was gone, I knew that Beatrix's death wishes were in the books...the 4 assassins have all gone to heaven, and Beatrix's baby, B.B., a toddler, is now the new inspiration for Beatrix to get her life back to normal.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Less creative, boring drawn out dialog, and some of the scenes almost put me to sleep.It had potential. I liked the Bud character, but he wasn't enough to save this movie. I thought Bill talked too slowly and deliberately, and tried to be all wise, mysterious, dangerous and witty all at the same time. Didn't pull it off.Some scenes were good like the buried alive scene, the training scenes and... and not much else. That final scene was Boring. Put the kid to bed and get on with the movie for crying out loud. All that warm and fuzzy stuff really didn't have a place in this movie. Just didn't make sense. Tarantino is no film master.

I went to Vol 2 expecting more of the same and was very surprised. Reduced splatter, plot and actions explained! This really does elevate the total package to near excellence. I could see people who were put off by Vol 1 not seeing 2 at all. That is a real shame, but these were not originally conceived as two separate movies, and the slaughterhouse action of Vol 1, while way too heavy handed, was meant to be tempered by the slower paced exposition of Vol 2. A solid 8 but allow enough time to watch both halves.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
303,lale-ba,First one was better,6,16 March 2017,"Tarantino tends to make long movie stories, so Kill Bill"" wasn't much of an exception. With the overall time of over four hours, the quality and tempo of the story winds down in the second part of the saga, lacking the great standoffs from the first one. As for the directing, all the major elements are there also, with with a lesser level of homage, the creativity of sequences will be slightly lower, not diminishing Quentin's raw talent behind the camera. The epic ending will be somewhat of a anticlimactic when compared to the overall rhythm of the script as well. Kill Bill vol.2"" is a good movie, but slightly weaker than the first part.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Not much could have been or should have cut from VOLUME 1, but I think this half was left uncut to make a second film possible. Tarantino is known for his elimination of the unnecessary, and he always gets right to the point, quite poetically, but this is unlike his style. It's Tarantino plus waste product. I was disappointed because I wanted the scenes to move, and they didn't quite do that crisply. ""Art is the elimination of the unnecessary."" I dozed-off at one point. I enjoyed the other scenes that were true Tarantino. Not a bad film, but one that SHOULD have been better. I wish the studio heads would leave him alone!

308,renofhate,The Bride closing in on the Dead Viper Assassination Squad's Remaining Members,10,26 January 2020,"Kill Bill Vol. 2 is Tarantino at his best! The Bride returns to finish where she left off.. I might be one of those few people who prefers part two to part one. Don't get me wrong, they're both equal for me as is, but I do think I'd choose part two if I had to. Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a lot like the first instalment but also a whole lot different. Tarantino delivers once again with an amazing action/martial arts/crime/thriller extravaganza. I love how these films pay homage to spaghetti westerns and grindhouse. The little elements that add to this film make it all the more better. While Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a bloody showdown, the second Kill Bill instalment feels like a continuation in the form of story more so than anything. The scenes that depict The Bride while doing her training are some of my favourite scenes of the entire Kill Bill double-act. The villain, main antagonist Bill, is actually here in this one. As you could guess. There are some over-the-top scenes of epic sword brutality though, don't think otherwise. The music is a particular highlight for the movie as well, and co-stars Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen, and David Carradine all give great performances. The choreography is good and the cinematography and set locations and scenery are all good as well. The dialogue is brilliant through and through. I love the character development in this film as well because you find out more about The Bride herself, and more of a backstory is prominent in this one. The fact that this one depicts more scenes from the past is interesting and one of my favourite things about the film. There are some unexpected twists that I really enjoy as well in Vol. 2. I love the scenes with Bill and The Bride as well, and I thought the film's opening act was a good choice given it starts with The Bride and Bill and looks back to when The Bride was gunned down adding to the story before the film is even properly started. Bill's death scene is so well done, especially given it's the shortest fight between The Bridge and anyone. A quick but effective death, full of impact, and the acting from Thurman in particular during the scene is outstanding. It's highly enjoyable from start to finish, I love it, and I can't recommend it enough. Tarantino does it again!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
309,jeroen-106,"Nice, but the ending is boring",6,20 December 2009,"Some great moments, but the ending is really boring. Tarantino wants to show us and explain too much at the end which leaves a ""so-so"" aftertaste. Also, I think both movies are more ""style over substance"", which isn't bad per se, but because of the lack of cohesion I didn't feel much for the characters. Highlights: The ""buried alive scene"" + ""girls fight in the trailer"". Very well done.Personally I would like to see ""Kill Bill 0"". How did those guys got together in the first place? Why did they hated Beatrix so much? Just because she broke Bill's heart? That I don't think is enough. Kill Bill 0 could explain this, and show off some cool ""assassin missions"".",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

The Bride escapes near- death several times, trains under the great Pai Mei and gets revenge on the people in her organization who tried to kill her.Uma Thurman, in this film, gives arguably the best performance in Tarantino history. Atop from being every bit as ruthless, she plays the role of a mother looking for her child so convincingly well, that at the end, it inspires awe. But having already seen Kill Bill 1, it doesn't feel as novel. At the end of the day, both films are two halves of a whole: a pure escapist homage to old classic ninja flicks.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

312,LBytes,Better when you see both,9,14 November 2004,"Possible spoilers.The Kill Bills really need to be watched one after the other for the best effect. I saw #1 a while back and was less favorable to it than after seeing them together.I knew there were tributes to Asian martial arts movies in #1, but I'm not a big follower of those, so it wasn't until I saw #2 that I realized that there must have been quite a lot of references, because #2 is filled with Western tributes, mostly Spaghetti Western tributes. #2 has Leone written all over it, with even a dash of Peckinpah and Eastwood in the way scenes are staged, and you can hear Morricone's haunting epic music a mile away. I love catching on to references like that and Tarantino has gotten real good at it. #2 is probably the better half. There's much more dialog, the sort of dialog that Tarantino does so well. and enough action to keep things going, including another Battle of the Bad*ss *itches with Thurman vs. Hannah, as well as a claustrophobic segment that I didn't know about that also worked as a good tie-in to Uma's martial arts training. #1 has some classic scenes besides just fights, though, that entertained me. The whole big scene leading up to the Crazy 88s battle has all kinds of things going on that you don't see the 1st time. 9/10 for both when seen together.Both DVDs have extras, but #2 has the best with a Making Of and some premiere night music. I'm tempted to buy a movie just because it has a DTS soundtrack so the fact that both of these do is icing on the cake. Thus the DVDs also get a 9/10 but perhaps a bit weaker 9. You can see a combined Ultimate Special Edition coming with this duo as there must be more stuff they're holding back on, milking the DVD buyers with multiple releases I'm happy with these so it would have to be really something to tempt me.I read some of the comments so-called professional critics made panning these movies. They just don't get it. Most of the discouraging words are about the blood and guts, but I thought segments like the Crazy 88s were cartoonish, just like the wirework in that segment, and was deliberate overkill to keep it from looking real. How can you take those blood sprays seriously? At least I think thats what Tarantino was up to, but I didn't ask him. Maybe he just likes to gross out wimpy movie critics. I mean so what if Lucy Liu gets a real deep buzzcut Some dissed him for lifting characters from old movies which is really a dumb*ss comment since he did it on purpose.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Fantastic utilization of the locations, unbelievable use of light and architecture and enough Tarantino to make me laugh until I cried.  I was honestly afraid the people in the theater were going to throw me out but after I laughed loud enough, the rest of them decided it was Okay to laugh along.  I will go see this movie again and will definitely buy the dvd when it comes out.
My favorite part, Daryl Hannah.  I didn't realize what a hottie Uma was until the second installment.

Stuff like this is all very intense and awesome to watch. Major props to Uma Thurman. The reveal of Bill having her daughter all this time was pretty shocking. In the first film we always knew she was missing but to see the man Beatrice has done so much to kill just he around her is very effective. To she her breakdown is kinda powerful and tough to watch even. The end title card is also a nice touch along with certain details scattered across the film. However, I did not like this movie as much as the first one. It didn't make me jump out my seat as much and I'm kinda disappointed by that. Bill's death was also not that good.

320,donuthaters12,Needs A Rewrite To Correct It's Shortcomings,5,9 January 2014,"Kill Bill Volume 2 is the continuation of The Bride's story in getting her revenge against Bill. I consider Kill Bill as one of Tarantino's weaker films, and Volume 2 is definitely a big reason why it's a letdown.The film is written by Quentin Tarantino and what he has written here is much more dialogue and story heavy than the first volume. I enjoyed the first volume a lot more because it is much more fun and stylish, this second volume holds back much more of that in service to the story which wasn't all that great to begin with. Normally heading towards the end, a film with this story should be much more intense than the first half but that's not the case. The bulk of the build up of the climax is dull due to the underwhelming dialogue, though the pregnancy test sequence was hilarious. The climax itself would have been a great opportunity for Tarantino to write something spectacular and thrilling, yet it felt like Tarantino couldn't find some sort of vision of it and just wrote something that can be done swiftly. I know Tarantino can write because he has proved it with great dialogue-driven films like Pulp Fiction and Death Proof or mainstream action driven films like Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained. Kill Bill combines both aspects together and proved to be ineffective. The film's story isn't all bad with an interesting burial segment and a throwback to the old Kung-Fu Chinese films that had me smiling throughout.Tarantino directs this film with a much more slower pace, in order to flesh out the story and gain more insight to it's characters. This film at times feels too safe for me, with moments that have characters just talking, which I don't mind if the dialogue was written better, leaving me feeling underwhelmed. Kill Bill as a whole's best moments are the segments that are over the top, violent and experimental. These experimental moments include the Pai Mei chapter, feeling like it was from a 1980's cheesy Kung Fu film. If Tarantino treated this half of the film like the first half then Kill Bill as a whole would have been an instant favorite of mine.Robert Richardson comes back as the director of photography for this film and this time the scenes don't look as hyper stylised and overly saturated as the first volume. I do admire the fact that this film doesn't look the same the entire run of the film, with moments in black and white, changing the aspect ratio of the film, and using split screen to show two things at once. The Pai Mei sequence was shot in such a way that is similar to the old Asian Kung Fu films, with grainy photography and lacking in vibrancy in it's color. Though there are great moments in this volume's photography, I much prefer the style that was applied for the first volume.RZA didn't come back to do the score for this film, which is odd as I liked what he did for the first volume. Instead Robert Rodriguez is credited for the music of the film, I am sure that he did the final song but I am not aware of any other moments in where he might have contributed. The film's music still follows that inspiration of Ennio Morricone, with some tracks actually written from him, and gives the film this Western feel to it. There are also moments where it uses Asian inspired music which works well with the tone of the film. The sound effects of this film is hilarious as they use the cheesy effects that are found on the films that this was inspired by. I wish that this film does retain that upbeat and fun soundtrack that fueled the first volume, but I guess that would be inappropriate judging by the events that unfolds during this film.Uma Thurman as The Bride is still great but this time it seems the film demands more from her and she does a great job. She may seem less bad-ass here because vulnerabilities arise and there are times where she is outmatched by her opponent which we didn't see a lot from the first volume. I felt that Bill was a little dull because of the way Tarantino has written him, but David Carradine does the most he can with the character. Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen as Elle and Budd were fun to watch as they play characters that are classic Tarantino; fun, hilarious, and unpredictable. I wish Madsen were in much more entertaining films because he is a wonderful actor to watch. Gordon Liu as Pai Mei was definitely hilarious and written with such absurdity that anything that comes out his mouth is pure comedic gold or bad-ass.Kill Bill Volume 2 is a bit of a disappointment in comparison to the first volume and the other films in the director's catalogue. If the film was fun like the first one, or at least written better then I would have liked this film a lot.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Whereas the first movie simply consisted of The Bride getting from point A to point B and murdering a bunch of bad guys, this movie explores her as a character more, her backstory and how the events leading up to the first movie came to be. It also has more dialogue-heavy scenes, which was a nice change of pace.

323,RJBose,Revenge of the Nerd,5,25 April 2004,"Having not seen the first installment of this two part series, I was curious to see whether or not ""Kill Bill, Volume II"" could stand on its own as an entertaining and interesting story.  The short answer is no.  Most bad films have bad writing, bad direction, bad photography and bad acting.  KB II is actually quite strong in each of these departments, but it is in general so bizarre that each of these elements is overcome in what is some type of twisted homage and loveletter from Director Tarentino (a kung-fu movie nerd is his youth) to star Uma Thurman. Perhaps with the well known rampage of blood and gore of its predecessor having been accomplished, KB II apparently is filling in the blanks on some of the issues raised in KB I.  Knowledge of the first part might make the second part more intrinsically interesting, but KB II drags along with long sequences of essentially pretty and clever, but dull movie-making, punctuated by occasional outbursts of exceptional violence and stark ugliness. If you have some sort of fetish for Uma, and an unnatural fascination with martial arts films, KB II is definitely a must-see.

There are no huge half-hour long swordfights, no exotic locales and caricatures of yakuza. Instead, we get a grittier look at The Bride (Beatrix Kiddo) as she takes to Texas and Mexico to chase her former mentor and lover, Bill.We get excellent background on the massacre at Two Pines Chapel, we learn more of the relationship between Bill and Beatrix, as they edge closer and closer. You, the viewer who has seen Kill Bill Vol. 1, knows that The Bride at that time has no idea of the upcoming massacre, and thus Bill's words ring with menace.We then cut to Budd, in one of the best scenes of the movie. While Kill Bill Vol. 1 was a pastiche of swordfighting, over-the-top action and so on, this one is stark, gritty, realistic. We see Budd has a dead end job and is looking for a fast buck. He dispatches of Beatrix with brutal efficiency, and the Texas Funeral was claustrophobic in the extreme. Elle is gorgeous and deadly. She IS ""blonde ambition"" and she proves it by dispatching Budd, then giving Black Mamba more than a run for her money.
The Cruel Tutelage of Pai Mei is an excellent segment, showing the training she got, and Pai Mei is cruel, but efficient. I loved some of the sequences in this part, especially the training to punch walls.The last chapter is perhaps the most lush and stimulating, as Beatrix goes to find one of Bill's father figures, then Bill himself. And...Beatrix's child, B.B. :-> The child will melt your heart, and adds even more motivation for the bride to... Kill Bill.Does she? How does she do it? Go see the movie to find out.

328,jt1999,Crap.,2,17 April 2004,"This is a complete load of horse***t masquerading as a movie.  Tedious, talky, derivative, full of itself.  Not much different from Tarantino's other films.  But at least ""Vol. 1"" was a load of finely polished crap.  It may not have been profound, but at least it was entertaining.  At times.The problem with Tarantino is that he falls in love with his own cutesy dialogue, then refuses to cut it.  The final scene -- the supposedly climactic battle with ""Bill"" -- was beyond disappointing, beyond anticlimactic.  Two sad and pathetic human beings trying to talk tough, cliche after cliche, putting the audience to sleep in the process.  Why talk at all?What we have here is an actress standing in for a director (they look like brother and sister to me), acting out the director's revenge and bloodletting fantasies, demonstrating in the process the director's infantile contempt for humanity, his disregard and contempt for human life, and his reliance on other people's ideas in the absence of his own.  The ""Fistful of Dollars"" soundtrack being thrown into the mix merely reminded me of the great Sergio Leone, the great Clint Eastwood.  When I heard this great music, ""Titoli,"" I believe it's called, at a packed midnight showing at the Cinerama Dome last night (and I consider screening this adolescent wank-fest at the Dome a total sin), I felt sad, thinking: this is what we've come to, this is what movies have deteriorated to: idiotic rehashes and ""homages"" to great and serious filmmaking of the past.
The film-noir credit sequence at the end was stupid, overlong and completely inappropriate.  The ""Q"" and ""U"" credit made me want to puke.  The final outtake of Uma demonstrated once again the sheer pointlessness of the entire thing.""Let's do it again,"" she says.  Another take?  Hopefully not another movie.
I know Quentin; he seems like a nice guy.  And he's a damn good filmmaker, to a degree.  But he's an overgrown kid -- and a bloodthirsty one at that. Maybe he's a little bit retarded.  Maybe some day he'll grow up.  Maybe someday he'll actually put his creative energy into something that matters.

And hey, if I don't see 10 better films this year, this will be the top of my 2004 list.Kill Bill: Vol 2 concludes the tale of The Bride, and it does it with wonderful style.

I never expected to cry at a Quentin Tarantino film, but this one did it, and it's at the most unexpected moment that I cried (during the chapter of Paula Schultz).

330,daria84,A masterpiece by Tarantino.,10,1 September 2004,"I've been waiting to see this movie for so long, and when I finally saw it, I loved it! it was worth the wait.  Vol.2 picks up pretty much where Vol.1 left, except for some flashbacks explaining what really happened with the characters.  Uma Thurman is back as The Bride, and we get to know her real name finally.  Also Daryl Hannah comes back as Elle Driver, the one-eyed killer, Michael Madsen plays Budd, Bill's baby/loser brother, and the infamous Bill is played by David Carradine.  The performances are just great, Uma Thurman delivers a great performance as The Bride, we finally get to know her character a little better and the true reasons why she wants to ""Kill Bill"".  I also have to say that David Carradine was perfect to play Bill.  He has great charisma and he's so smooth, it's impossible not to like him.  Daryl Hannah's performance was great too, and Michael Madsen's too. Once again the music plays a key factor in this movie, is very well selected and for every single scene the music fits perfectly.  And of course, the dialogue.  In this movie, we get a lot more dialogue than brutal fighting like in Vol.1, this movie is more centered in explaining what led Bill to do what he did, it pretty much focuses in the past, explaining the whole thing. I especially liked the dialogues between Bill (Carradine) and The Bride (Thurman), I thought they were clever and just great, like all Tarantino's dialogues.  Also the locations were excelent, I have no idea where they shot the film, but the landscaping was great, I truly enjoyed it.Well it would be better to see Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 as one movie, not different, because in the end, you must see them together to understand.  So I give this movie a 10/10, I loved it, it was great, great dialogues, great performances, great fighting sequences, everything was great!

It just didn't give the same satisfaction as the first movie.I thought the action scenes were not up to the standards of the first one.

After all the hype in the first film as well as the first few parts of this one I found it rather disappointing and anticlimactic. I absolutely loved the story of the Bride and Pei-Mei. It made me remember some of the old Chinese kung-fu movies I used to watch in my younger years down to the classic ""You killed my master"" plot line.I also thought the scoring was pretty good and some of the props and costumes were also good.It could have been better but nonetheless it was a good film.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
332,benowen-91207,Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2 retrospective,9,23 June 2020,"So I'm just going to talk about my feelings on both parts of this 'franchise'. First of all the narrative and events are quite simple and easy to follow, but it's Tarantino's screenplay and direction that elevate these two movies to his all time bestKILL BILL VOL. 1: although you can tell what my score for vol. 2 is, I may aswell say that that I think vol. 1 is a 10. That should really say it all. Some of the best cinematography, action choreography and writing in, well any film. My problem with 2 is that there is significantly less action than the 1st one. This would not be a problem if the action in the first was so damn good. I also think of moments like the silhouetted action scene and the 'anime-homage' backstory, creative risks that are noticeably lacking in the 2nd. As it stands, kill bill vol 1. Is absolutely incredible and I would highly recommend itKILL BILL VOL. 2: I'm gonna be honest, the only thing that vol 2. Improves after the 1st is the screenplay, which is arguably the most essential part of any Tarantino joint. There aren't as many great moments as the first one, but that's obviously not what this one is trying to achieve. This is about adding more character to, specifically, Bill and the Bride. I have my problems with it, like that pointless part where bill's brother gets fired or the anticlimactic fight at the end (again, because of the context of the first movie)Anyway watch both of these if you haven't, they're great.KB 1 - 10/10

333,javaman-7,Tarantino displays his formidable writing and character development skills.,10,20 May 2020,"Vol. 2 continues the cycle of revenge, as well as flashing back to earlier events which provide context and motivation for some of the dizzying action of the first episode. The Bride, whose name we learn is Beatrix Kiddo, must deal with Bill's trailer-trash brother Budd (Madsen) and the deadly, one-eyed Elle Driver (Hannah) before her showdown with Bill (Carradine). We also learn that she has studied with Kung Fu master Pai Mei (Liu) and has learned techniques that will take on significance as her odyssey continues.All through Arthurian legend and Eastern myth, the magic, invincible sword has been a central symbol invested with unending layers of significance. Filmmakers have taken great care to photograph it just the right angle, with just the right highlights so that its power and meaning can never be questioned. In Vol. 1, The Bride acquires such a sword from the legendary Hattori Hanzo, who comes out of retirement to make a weapon so powerful that ""if in your journey you should encounter God, God will be cut."" But another such blade is in possession of Bill's brother Budd, who must use it to prevent her from getting to Bill. When Bill asks Budd where this myth-laden, highly significant symbol of power might be, Budd says, ""I pawned it."" ""But it was priceless."" ""Well, I got $250 bucks for it."" This is the sort of dialogue that can only be called Tarantinian. TIn my review of Vol. 1, I wrote: ""But this is only Volume 1, and we don't even know what the main character's backstory is yet. Tarantino has Volume 2 to fill in some of the missing motivation as well as display his formidable writing and character development skills.""And that is exactly what he does in Vol. 2. He has created great characters on the page and has brought them to life with flawless casting and seamless direction. Thurman's Beatrix may be studied in future years as one of the all-time great women characters ever put on screen. Both she and Carradine should start shopping for formal wear when awards season rolls around. Tarantino may even have a shot at Best Director. Also riveting is the performance by Hannah as Beatrix' rival, both for Bill's affection and for martial arts supremacy. Their confrontation is a masterpiece of choreography, stunt work, and eye-catching editing. Note that at the end of the credits there is a hilarious out-take from this scene.One often hears the comment that ""they don't make movies like they used to."" But with young filmmakers such as Tarantino and older ones the likes Scorsese, Eastwood and Polanski all working at top form, we may just be in the middle of a filmic golden age and just don't know it yet.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

335,tvspace,afterbirth,2,25 April 2004,"Kill Bill, Vol. 2 is the ugly, sadistic, misshapen, and vulgar offspring of a cinematic barbarian, Quentin Tarantino.  Worse, it's boring.This is truly one of the most wretched films I've ever sat through, on every level.  The movie has no style; rather like a particularly bad episode of Saturday Night Live, each scene seems beamed in from a different planet in the solar system.  Trying to get into the groove with this movie is like trying to eat poached eggs while riding in the back of a Dune buggy.  It just ain't gonna happen.The most notable aspect of the film is the obvious sadistic pleasure Tarantino takes in dreaming up cruel and violent deaths for his characters, then filming the demise in agonizingly clinical close-ups.  The fact that the director obviously believes all this carnage is righteous revenge only adds to the squalor.  If Tarantino was an 8th grader, he'd be sent in for counseling.  Since he's a film director, he'll be congratulated for his ""edginess"" by those who think that the only way to measure art is by the jolt it gives you on the Richter scale.While this movie has been repeatedly described as a ""Kung Fu movie"", in fact it is nothing of the sort.  Tarantino doesn't begin to have the discipline to make a genre picture.  Kill Bill, Vol. 2 is a self-indulgent flatulence that borrows devices from Kung Fu, Spaghetti Westerns, horror movies, and comic books in the haphazard manner a hyperactive, pimply-faced junior-high delinquent rummages through his stunted intellectual landscape before writing ""F*ck Mrs. Jones"" on the urinal wall between classes.Kill Bill, Vol 2 might be described as trash, but that wouldn't be fair to trashy movies.  It utterly lacks the essential joie de vivre that makes a good drive-in romp fun to chew popcorn to.  Indeed, Kill Bill takes itself seriously  -- deadly seriously -- and is as dull, self-righteous and dim-witted as a Driver's Ed movie.  Time at first seems to stand still in this movie, as one interminable monologue after another explicates the minute science of mamba snakes or the trivialities of running a strip joint. By the time the film is over it has gotten so slow that time literally runs backwards: Tarantino makes you sit through the credits of the first Kill Bill at the end of this one... his ultimate and final act of self-indulgence.Tarantino is a hack, and this movie is his hacksaw.  Steer far clear.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

1. The film is a perfect tribute to martials arts movies. There are many scenes for fans of this genre.
2. The performance of Uma Thurman and David Carradine is great.
3. The ending is perfect. Tarantino gives you a hint but there are high chances you won't be able to predict it.

Uma Thurman does a good job, Daryl Hannah does a good job, Michael Madsen does a good job and of course David Carridine does a good job. Kill Bill: Vol.2 is better than Million Dollar Baby and The Aviator. Quentin Tarantino should have an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay and Best Director. This movie is better than Kill Bill: Vol.1. This movie has action and humor. This is Uma Thurman's best movie.

The music is portrayed beautiful in a great manner. This movie reminds just of Good the Bad and the Ugly. The music all the action sequences, the hardcore attitude, and the great storyline that proceeds to it as it all goes together to perfection. Tarentino being a fan of martial arts knew exactly what he was doing from the beginning. Uma Thurman played her part perfect with the emotion and sensitivity. David Carradine played his part perfect as the assassin who wanted to kill her but still cared about her and wanted her to be a warrior and even better then him. I found this movie very enjoyable a typical Tarentino movie, he hit another one rite on the point. I give this movie a 9 out of 10. A great martial arts movie.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
340,michaelheiser-25099,Better than hoped for.....,5,14 November 2021,"I'm not into violence and profanity. I wish they would not use Thurman for these roles as she's a much better actress than this. The key to this film's color is really very simple - colourful characters and dialogue. I have to be honest and say that I found the script for Kill Bill Volume 2 to be weaker than some of his previous efforts with much of the dialogue coming off as being extremely forced - but this is a comic book thrill ride at it's best and the characters themselves shine all the way through. As mentioned previously, the film is much slower than the first one, although there's plenty going on and the first hour and twenty minutes is a constant thrill ride complete with menacing characters and grisly situations (though nothing to rival the climax to Volume 1. Of course, the entire two part epic is a build up to the central character carrying out the title's statement and Tarantino really had a lot of promise to deliver on with the ending. Anyone hoping for a spectacular face off (me for example) will be extremely disappointed, however. David Carradine does get lots of opportunities to justify his place in the film - he's by far the most natural actor in terms of how he delivers his dialogue and the filmmakers rewards this by giving him plenty of interesting things to say; but the final showdown is over far too quickly. So there are good points I just do not appreciate violence in films. Our society is at the breaking point.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
341,katydid4819,"Good Acting, Good Film making",9,25 April 2004,"I don't know whether or not I liked this film. While watching, I enjoyed it and was interested to find out what happened next. Yet, after leaving the theater, I was left feeling that maybe there should have been something more. Or maybe something less.Uma Thurman's performance is something I can say that I liked both while watching and afterward. She has more character development in this film than in the first and she wastes no time sinking her teeth deep into the part. She is one tough chick and at the same time she is still human, which is something the film needs. She grounds the movie while everything else spins along side. Maybe the best word for my reaction is that this movie felt creepy. Tarantino's obsession with Thurman is made very obvious, especially in the last chapter. She responds with the reaction of a young girl when her father tells her how pretty she is; one of those comments that you know means something else. I say this is some of Uma's best acting right here in this scene.Without all the gore of the first film, this one does some background exploring of the characters and it makes a very good follow up to the first. Despite my weird feelings, this film is still one that I recommend. ***/****",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
342,eddie052010,I'm going slightly mad.,1,26 February 2015,"When sequels are usually released, they are often rubbish, as they are merely cash-ins on the original's success and while they often suck, they usually aren't abysmally bad, ad they are more often lazy than anything else. Sadly, this is a case when the sequel to an already dreadful original is so bad, it makes the original look like a masterpiece by comparison.The story is that The Bride is still on her bloody revenge, and is now after the head honcho, Bill. However, due to the many obstacles that get in her way, including Bill's bodyguards and the reunion with her daughter, will she be able to kill Bill? My problem with the story is that it is very badly written, from the constant plot holes (e.g. why does the Bride bring a sword with her everywhere she goes, despite facing potentially armed men), useless characters and even more pointless footage than last time. While it is nice to see her training montage or her wedding rehearsal before the massacre in theory, they serve to show things that either the audience already knows, or doesn't care to. Seriously, you could cut huge chunks out of both films, and lump them together as one, and it would be a better film because of it.Another huge problem is the unsympathetic main character, as despite her understandable motivations for her revenge, she is a sadistic sociopath who kills because it gives her pleasure rather than for revenge, and who doesn't have any remorse for her victims, which (despite what some feminists might have believe) isn't a good role model for the young women potentially watching this movie. What makes this worse however is the fact that when she reunites with her daughter after so long, you don't feel any sympathy, as not only do you feel that she would be an awful mother to the child (something she even admits to by saying that she can never live a normal life), but considering that she killed a mother in front of her 4- year old daughter in the previous film, it is even harder to swallow. It doesn't help that her character is never fully developed either, which makes the film hard to watch as a result.The main bad guy, Bill, is equally as dull, feeling constantly one- note throughout and gets rather boring because of it, despite David Carradine's great performance, and he often gets the movie's worst lines, including a theory that the Bride is a killer on the inside, and wears her more mature self as a disguise similar to Superman (because as we all know, people like soldiers are always destined to kill people, as they do it on the frontlines). One thing that is very annoying is that while some of the characters are completely pointless, they are the best ones in the film, in particular Michael Madsen's Bud, Gordon Liu's Samurai master or Deryl Hannah's Elle, who is easily the best thing about the film, as the character had the most personality, and Deryl's performance is both charismatic and sexy. You would wish the film was about them than some crazy sociopath, but that isn't the case, and sadly they are usually killed the quickest as well. The more personality you have in the film, the quicker you are killed. The rest of the script is completely lacklustre as well, as outside of all the plot problems, the film's dialogue is overdone and often ridiculous. While Tarantino's unique style of dialogue may have worked in Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs, here it is utterly inane, as unlike the aforementioned films, it isn't funny, quirky or essential to the story, leading to a lot of long winded pointless scenes that make the film feel a lot longer than it is. This story clearly didn't need two parts to tell it, and Tarantino should actually edit his films before he releases them. It is also casually sadistic as well, as eyes are pulled out and stepped on, a man gets bitten by a snake over and over and a blind woman runs around screaming in agony. It feels very crass as a result, and you would wish Tarantino would grow up already. It also doesn't help that many of the film's major set pieces don't pay off, as they are either too brief or are interrupted by the boring story. This is especially true of the film's climax.While there are some good elements in the film (good acting and great cinematography for example), overall it is utter crud. Whether it would be the awful writing, unsympathetic characters, sadism, overlong and pointless bits or the utter anticlimax, Kill Bill Vol 2 is an abysmal movie-making experience, that everyone should avoid at all costs in order to stop letting Tarantino's Samurai fan-fics get millions of dollars and well known actors behind it, and to teach him to make proper, grown-up films next time. Complete and utter garbage.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
343,m0rg16,"Less action, more talk",6,1 May 2004,"In the original film, we saw Uma Thurman kill loads and loads of people to get to two people. She namely out to kill two out of the Assassin squad she had once been part of, but which later betrayed her. After she managed to kill two out of it's four members, the movie ended. But we all knew that a Volume 2 was coming up.In Volume 2 she goes after the remaining members of the Assassin squad, plus it's leader: Bill. This time, it's awhole lot of more talk and less action. In contrast to the assassins played by Lucy Liu and Viveca A. Fox in the first volume, the assassins in these films (played by Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah) are very much developed. At least Michael Madsen's character (Budd). We follow him for a few hours of his life, prior to the moment when the Bride shows up. However, it appears Budd is quite resourceful and manages to evade the Bride's attack.Daryl Hannah's character Elle is brought into the picture as Budd wants to sell her a sword. Elle get's a little less development as we don't really see any scenes from her normal everyday life. But from the dialogue she later shares with The Bride, we get to know quite abit about her character. Superbly done, everything. The Bride and Elle share an awesome fight scene, with a very surprising and perfect ending.So anyway, that fight scene is the only real action we get in this film. And one might say that that's not what we wanted, considering everyone loved Kill Bill Vol. 1 for it's over the top violence and action. This film is more story driven than the first Volume, and it's definetly great. Altough some scenes tend to get a little bit to slow. Quentin could have cut some scenes down by a minute or so, to keep the audiences interested, instead of starting to lean back in their seats, waiting for something to happen.The soundtrack, like all Quentin's films, is superb. The acting is great. The dialogue may not be as good as his other films, but it holds up (most of the time). It has a good ending (altough there's not a big fight involved, if that's what you want). Pretty much, this film has what we wanted from Kill Bill vol. 2. It's an excellent, but not flawless, continuation of Volume 1.You should definetly go see this. Especially if you enjoyed the first volume.9/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
344,ctrout,Even Better Than The First,10,21 March 2007,"I first saw this one on its opening day, April 16, 2004, just as I had seen Volume One on its opening day, six months earlier. The night before I saw it I refreshed my memory by viewing the first film and I was glad that I did. Both movies really should be viewed as one single film because of how much you miss if you see just one of them. However, I will say that each movie can also stand on its own as a great film. I'll begin by saying that I enjoyed this one just a little bit more than the first. I think that has a lot to do with David Carradine. Quentin Tarantino has a knack for bringing fading stars back from obscurity and he did it again with this great actor. Carradine plays the title character and brings Bill to life so much so that you kind of find yourself a little worried about the fact that our protagonist might actually end up killing him as the title suggests.Speaking of our hero, Uma Thurman delivers yet another powerful performance as ""The Bride,"" a former assassin hell bent on getting revenge for what her former ""co-workers"" did to her on her wedding day. This chapter in the two volume series continues with The Bride's journey and leads up to a fantastic climax that only Tarantino, the best director of today's generation, could bring you.That's not all! There's even a cat fight that may go down in history as the best one ever captured on film. As one of the members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad on The Bride's hit list, Daryl Hannah squares off against Uma Thurman in one of the tiniest spaces to hold a fight scene, a trailer home.Even Michael Madsen gets in on the action! As Bill's brother, Budd, Madsen plays one of the more sympathetic roles of his career, even though he's a cold blooded bastard. His character becomes very developed and we see what we saw only a glimmer of during the Vivica A. Fox sequence in the first: someone like us. We all know that Madsen is just another bad guy, but he shows us that those ""bad guys"" are just regular people trying to live in a world that doesn't want them.Of course, we can't forget about Pai Mei. The most fearsome martial arts expert is played superbly in this film by Gordon Liu. Although he speaks only Mandarin in the film, his intimidating looks and fiery delivery give us another great supporting performance in a movie that I'll stay with any time I happen to catch it on television. I'm sure that you would do the same. Yes, this film is a bloody good conclusion to the Kill Bill saga and, if you've seen the first, you definitely need to see this one to find out what happens and how it goes down. I recommend this to anyone and everyone because it's one of the best films of this decade.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
345,adam-may-bower,Perfect,10,2 June 2018,"'Kill Bill: Volume 2' is the better, perfect half of Tarantino's bloody affair. While Volume 1 was a fast-paced and quirky action film, Volume 2 is a steadily paced drama. Toning down on the excessive violence from the first film, Tarantino adds emphasis more on dialogue. This results in a much more serious and slow-burning atmosphere that makes the ever-so-brilliant fight scenes a whole lot more entertaining. In this case, less is more. During this film, the missing puzzle pieces are all put together into the outstanding, non-linear plot line that makes this film so memorable. Despite being filled with unpredictable plot twists and a satisfying ending, the film really shines through it's superb screenplay. The film has amazing monologues and dialogue that captivates it's audience and showcases mastery of Tarantino's writing. Another great aspect of this film is the developing portrayal of The Bride. Depicted as a ruthless, invincible fighting machine in Volume 1, we see her vulnerability in this film while also learning how she came to be such a deadly assassin. Just like in Volume 1, Uma Thurman plays this role perfectly. It is also David Carradine, who plays the infamous Bill, that plays his character exceptionally well, and delivers great monologues. Overall, this is a flawless conclusion to a great and entertaining film by the ingenious Quentin Tarantino.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
346,atlihafsteinsson,"A good film at its heart, too overblown and misproportioned for its own good",9,2 October 2010,"Granted, Kill Bill vol. 1 was a tough act to follow. Considering that the two films were meant to be one big film, I was rather taken aback when I finally saw Vol. 2. I enjoyed it. There is lots to like about it, certainly. Unfortunately, it has its pretty glaring flaws to match.The cinematography of the movie is pretty impressive, as is the set-up. The camera angles and staging all work very well. The coffin scene is quite difficult to watch, B/W to perhaps subtly accentuate the Bride's feelings, not so unlike those she felt at the chapel. The introduction, with all the people in the chapel, makes the viewer generally afraid for them, because we know what will happen to them, in just a few minutes time.The acting is also very good, and the characters are given good room to breathe (perhaps too much room but bear with me). Uma Thurman is still fantastic in the leading role. We delve a little beneath her icy, broken exterior of the first movie and get a good look at this troubled individual. Sometimes, it's hard to remember that she's even on a bloody quest of revenge. David Carradine is compelling as her yang, Bill, someone who also makes us forget that he is, in his own words, ""a murdering bastard"". Daryl Hannah as Elle Driver, finally appearing after the appetiser of Vol. 1, is wickedly chilling and at the same time hilarious. Even with her, it gets hard to remind yourself that this woman is a heartless, vile being. Michaels Madsen and Parks give good, laid-back performances as well.What bothers me about Kill Bill volume 2 is the same thing that bothers most people - it is such a different film from Volume 1 to make it feel rather flat by comparison. Most of the satisfaction we expected to feel after seeing Volume 1 is not handed out. Both Budd's and Elle's demises, albeit pleasantly and freshly unexpected, feel totally contradictory to the element of this as a revenge flick. There are a lot of scenes that have no significance to the plot. The whole bar scene could totally have been cut out; Bill's and Elle's scenes with Budd were enough to register the character to the audience. A lot of the dialogue really could have been shortened. I know that Tarantino likes to have his characters talk about stuff that really is irrelevant to the plot, and that he likes to homage past movies. All the same, a film has to be able to stand on its own. If its only level of engagement is that it shows film buffs references, that's alienating the involvement of a large number of prospective audiences.It would be cruel of me to accuse KB2 of having no substance, though. There are themes of moral dilemma and unsuccessfully trying to flee who you are. Uma Thurman really goes all out with her character and turns in one of the finest performances of her career. The flashback scene with her (douchebag) master Pai Mei are entertaining and fill a large gap in the void of her backstory. It's just a shame that the albeit furious fight scene with Elle follows, where the Bride seems barely able to keep up (and this being the same woman we saw walk over everyone in her way in the last film). True, she's not exactly in an advantageous position. There is a general theme of smarts prevailing over brawn, as well as symbolism about just what revenge is.For me, though, and for many people, this just really wasn't the conclusion the first film had been building forward to. KB2 is a good film at its heart, but it's rather overblown and could easily have been trimmed down to simply have the meat. We don't even see the Death List, which was so symbolic for the first film. Even the excellent confrontation with Elle can't save the overall impression of the film. In conclusion, I was expecting a closure to the same story, not what felt like the closure to an entirely different story.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

After seeing part 1 I became an instant fan, but I was a bit afraid that no one could really live up to really making that Bill character alive enough. I was wrong - it could not have been done better than by David. Apart from him, of course all the others were good too - Ulma and the 'Hateful bitch'. Excellent music, excellent - almost absurd- discussions between the Bride and her opponents before they start the fight. Very successful mix between Spaghetti western genre and 70/80s Karate movies. And David Carradyne, if I spell it right, as Bill is unforgettable. Rollingstone once said, in the CD booklet of 40 licks, the Best of the Stones, that Keith Richards was the undisputed King of Cool - but no more, since the days of Bill! What an excellent voice, unforgettable lines, and of course last but not least acting - this guy should have got at least an Oscar nomination for it.

352,paul_mampilly,Cinematic Equivalent Of Finding Out That Santa Claus Does Not Exist.,6,30 April 2005,"I am sure that everyone in their young lives had that terrible moment of finding out that Father Christmas did not exist. Whether it was catching your Dad eating the cookies and milk while dressed up as St Nick, or just realizing that Playstation 2 you asked for ages still have not arrived. Either way, you felt betrayed in a way. A person you see as infallible, who brings joy and happiness in your life, seems to be nothing else but only human.That is how I felt when I saw Kill Bill Vol 2. Six years after Jackie Brown, Tarintino brings out Kill Bill Vol 1. After watching that movie, I knew that the genius was back in business. So knowing that Kill Bill Vol 2 was about to come out in a couple of months, I felt it was going to be more of the same. More mind blowing cinematic artistry, beautiful yet violent ballet of samurai swords and kung fu. As the months have passed by, my anticipations were rocketing sky high, and I could not wait to watch the movie, to see if my expectations were fulfilled.So April 23 come along, and my waiting is over. Yet my disappointment began Watch Out; Spoilers Ahead.The Bride now has only three on her ""to do in"" list, since Copperhead was annihilated in a show down in leafy suburbia, and then the scalping of O-Ren Ishii in the climax of the previous movie. So who was next on the list? The next person to meet their maker is Bill's brother, Budd. After a few scenes, Budd seems to have the upper hand over the Bride, when she was buried alive in a coffin. During her limited time in the claustrophobic space, she begins to think about her training with the wise and knowledgeable Pai Mei. Due to this thinking, she used this inspiration to get out of a pure solid wood coffin and six feet of dirt, and seek pure retribution on Budd. After the death of Budd, via a venomous snake, Elle Driver was next to feel the wrath of the Bride. It was during this altercation between the two female assassins, it has been found out that Elle Driver had killed The Bride's Chinese mentor. Due to this bombshell, The Bride just goes ballistic on cyclopytic blonde killer and rips off her other eye and leaves her to be blind. The list whittles down to one person, who is the main character in both movies, and also the namesake in this film's title. However there is a major twist in this movie, and that is where my movie review is going to leave it.The actors and actresses were pretty good in their roles. I thought Uma Thurman was absolutely amazing as the Bride, and I though Chia Hui Liu was good as the wise but unintentionally funny Pai Mei. I thought Micheal Madsen was pretty good as Budd, though I did want to see him play a bigger role, since I think he is such a good actor. I think that Daryl Hannah will now be more remembered as the deadly assassin rather than the dippy mermaid in Splash! It was definitely good to see the legend of Kung Fu playing a meaty role.I thought that the casting role was amazing, however the ending and the story really disappointed me. I just thought that the ending was such a damp squib, since all that crazy kung fu actions and the decapitations of enemies, just leads to someone who simply dies with a complex karate move, which no one sees. I just found it really disappointing, however that was only the icing on the cake. How can both Kill Bill Vol. 1 and Kill Bill Vol. 2 were the same movie? I could not see how is connected at all. To be honest, it feels like it was a money making stunt done by Mr Tarintino. I just wish that the movie was immediately released straight after the first installment. It has been said that this film shows the signature note that is always scrawled upon most of Quentin movies, but I felt that this one was a bit of a let down.In conclusion, I felt this movie was such a disappointment. I wanted to like this movie so much, however I felt betrayed by one of my favorite directors. One quick word to the director; direct better movies and stop acting in mediocre ones.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

She later tracks down Bill using a pimp Esteban (Micheal Parks) Bill's father figure and kills Bill. She leaves with BB and they live together happily ever after.

354,grumpyass,Semi decent film,7,30 April 2004,"Before I start, I want to point out I have not seen the first of the two movies.  So i may kick myself in the butt after posting this.  I want to say kill Bill 2 was decent.  I am not a Tarantino fan so I don't expect much out of him.  But I am a film student, so what I am about to say is coming from a film student point of view.  The movie had a lot of dialogue, most interesting but some seemed to ramble on & on.  Also what irritated me was that he doesn't use a lot of a shot variation.  He sticks with a constant shot for every scene and it gets boring, there is nothing there to hold you attention.  If he changed the shots up from time to time and not go back  & forth between two different shots, the movie would have been more interesting.  He does well with the action sequences but the other parts the shots are just boring.  I thought the black & white to color style was effective, relating to past & present.  That worked well.  I will say I am gonna try to rent the first film and watch it but so far i am impressed with the story but not with the filming style.

This scene earned the 2 points. Otherwise there has been no plot in part 1 and this did not miraculously change here either. The character of Bill is one of the main problems. It is quite unbelievable that this rather chatty but otherwise not remarkable guy is the origin of all evil (read the Trivia, can you imagine that Warren Beatty ever seriously considered this role? I can't). It is further hard to believe that every woman in the movie develops a crash on him. It is then not easier to perceive that he has lovingly raised a child of the woman he had shot, but then again, did not get killed and waited patiently for her return, then had her buried, and then even various others attending to her. In the first place, he does not seem to be worth the trouble. Then the part where Daryl Hanna's (first) eye gets poked out- in case you are a martial arts trainer and your pupil shows disrespect, take an eye but continue the relationship? Why only an eye? The brother is an enigma. I won't go into details, but surely he could have put up more of a fight in case he was in the assassin business before now. And the kill Bill part at the end? Uma Thurman actually talks him dead. No spectacular fight scenes be here any more.

I believe it was so because of the ""ultra"" high ratings that it received but when I saw it I did't share the enthusiasm. I just expected something different.And before I saw Vol. 2 I kind of already knew what to expect. Well I am glad to admit that I think I finally see why film fans are praising Tarantino the way they are. He really is a master in making us see into the hearts of violent people. I like Vol. 2 more because there are more dialogs and a better more complete style in the storytelling.I must shamefully admit that I have not yet seen Reservoir Dogs and Jackie Brown and yes I saw just the first 15 minutes of Pulp Fiction.

358,bigben5,Made total sense... and I didn't even see the first Kill Bill (slight spoiler),9,8 May 2004,"I heard this movie was really good, but was skeptical from the start because I hadn't seen he very first movie. Not to worry, the plot makes total sense and this movie fills in all the details you need to know. Further still, the acting was really good and so was the script. Probably the most disturbing thing about this film, I found, was the way Beatrice finishes off Ellen. It just looked so realisitc, painful and way too gory.  Very realistic indeed. I think the star of this film however, is Bill, the actor did a great job of portraying a villain with a sense of humor so well that it helped carry the movie when Uma Thurman's acting looked awkward. Speaking of Uma Thurman you can tell that she's not at all a very good fighter - she looks too awkward at moments and you cant tell some of the work has been done by a stunt double.I was also surprised at how graphic this movie is when you factor in the horror of Beatrice being buried alive. One minor gripe however is the way they show which chapter of the novel is playing, as well as that stupid actor that plays Pai Mei. I know him well. He stars in a lot of crappy chinese soap operas. Not only was it clear to me that he couldn't act at all but that they got the translations done all wrong. I understand Chinese perfectly and it only makes Uma Thurman sound stupid by giving simple answers to complex questions. Nonetheless, this movie is noteworthy.A",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

You learn to like Bill inspite of yourself, we know he's a horrible person, we know he's a killer, his talent is killing, but we do know he obviously loves her. He did a horrible act out of love for her.Chris Rock's Quote: ""Have you ever loved somebody so much that sometimes you want to kill them."" That quote sort of makes sense in this film. This is a Quentin Tarantino love story. Some people feel sorry for Bill because he loves her. Not that people will kill in the name of love, but some have. Now all of a sudden Uma Thurman is the bad guy for at least a little while, but you feel sympathetic to her aim as well. She wants revenge, because he did wrong by her, she feels betrayed, like he cheated her in some way, cheated her by taking the idea of a normal life for her and her baby.I don't like Bill, but I do understand why he did what he did, and I understand why the Bride feels so angry. And with there last words, Bill Quotes: I love you Kiddo.  The Bride Quotes: I love you to.

However the 2nd was just an average movie. If I didn't know any better, I would bet that the 2nd kill bill was by a different director.  Not only wasn't the story told as well as the first one, but the story itself was also not as interesting.  Most of the dialogue was cheesy and the action scenes did not have that magnificent feel that they had in the first kill bill. There were so many things in the first movie that gave it an epic like feel that were foolishly left out of the 2nd movie.  One was the list kept by the bride on people that she had to kill.  You would think with the significance the list played in the first movie, that at least she would cross out bills name when she had done the job.  However the list was nowhere to be found. With the incredible battle scenes that were in the first movie, you would expect the final scene with bill to trump all them.  But again, it didnt even come close.  The final scene where she gets bill was as anticlimactic and boring as you can get.  If you were a big fan of the first movie, I would recommend that you not even bother seeing the 2nd because it will only ruin the first movie for you.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
362,RandomTask-AP,Better Than a Game of No Limit Texas Hold 'Em,9,29 April 2004,"(MINOR SPOILERS)As The Bride (Uma Thurman) takes her vengeance quest back to the States, the nearly unlimited violence of the first volume is overtaken by story in 'Kill Bill: Volume 2'. Following the new trend of multiple films completed at the same time (a la 'Back to the Future', 'Lord of the Rings' and 'The Matrix'), it is a true continuation of the movie that was released last fall, and is a sequel only as far as the title is concerned. It is rumored that cinemaphile director Quentin Tarantino had originally wanted to create the experience of putting out 'Kill Bill' as a single film with an intermission between the halves. It would have been a moviegoer's dream to watch both parts in the same evening with a run time totaling over 4 hours. However, economics would not permit the artist's vision to be the way he had intended, but the sheer joy of witnessing the completed experience is a rewarding payoff for the wait.'Volume 1' was about The Bride's (Uma Thurman's) rage at being left for dead. It wasn't important how she got these other assassins to turn on her or how she herself was part of the gang. It was all about the action of bringing violent karma to a full and bloody circle. 'Volume 2' is all story. The whys and hows are put up for discussion, and Tarantino's characters all love to talk. In nonlinear style, we're back to the wedding chapel where the whole mess started and where everyone is alive and kicking. The emotion of the moment is what everyone is concerned with when Bill (David Carradine) shows up (deceptively alone). Because Bill is such a calm and seemingly reasonable figure, we hope against hope that the massacre will not occur as foretold. Unfortunately, nothing changes from the story we were told in the first movie, and The Bride is the only survivor. With the first half of Bill's former of assassins gang (played by Lucy Liu and Vivica A. Fox) dispatched in 'Volume 1', the film picks up with assassin number three, Bud (Michael Madsen), who is also Bill's estranged brother. When Bill comes to warn him of the vindictive heroine, Bud is living in a trailer on the fringes of small-town Texas and taking a great deal of grief at his job bouncing at the local strip club. The Bride moves in for the kill with her new Hatori Honzo sword, only to find the tables suddenly turned. Bud sets up her demise, and calls the fourth assassin, Elle (Daryl Hannah) offering to sell The Bride's priceless Honzo sword. In this time, we learn about how The Bride became such a star pupil in the lethal arts. The sale between Bud and Elle goes sour, and The Bride (who does eventually get a real name) dukes it out with the winner before moving on to Bill. Revealing how she gets to the object of her lethal affection and what happens when she gets to him is simply too well done in film to do it justice in print. It is full of Tarantino's trademark dialogue and tension, and in its own way, this steps above the masterful swordplay of the first climax.Revenge has never been this much fun, and it is Tarantino's lust for 70's pop culture and cinema that make it possible. (The recently style-less and dry 'Punisher' could take a note or two from this work.) The characters move in their own world and with their own story, but it is a world that we see through the filter of every other tacky revenge movie made in the 1970's. The movie envelops the audience into a camp world of retro pop culture thanks to director of photography Robert Richardson's exhaustive use of varying film stocks and obvious camera moves. In the flashback where we learn of The Bride's training, it is chemically washed out and aged to mute the colors. There is a wildly out-of-place shot where The Bride and Pai Mei train in silhouette against a red background, and it beautifully matches a shot of sword-fighting silhouettes against the blue background from the first half. Director and cinematographer pile on the homages to different directors and films like a kid at an all-you-can-eat make-your-own-sundae bar. It's a dizzying achievement that is all the more enjoyable because you know that Tarantino has done it because he loves it and wants to share that with the whole world. It's the approach Andy Kaufman took to comedy. 'Who cares if the rest of the world thinks its good or not? I think it's great.' 'Kill Bill' is all the better because of that carefree attitude. It's Tarantino's ability to convey that feeling which keeps everything from being just a collection of miscellaneous nods to other directors.Even if you haven't seen the first half, 'Kill Bill: Volume 2' is a giddy treat of cinema. Rarely does a movie come along and make you feel like a kid in awe while also appealing to your adult sensibilities. Go and see this. Leave the kids at home, and make sure you have enough time to get popcorn. This is a movie experience that just won't be complete without it.9 out of 10PS: Stick around until the end of the credits for the rumored blooper reel.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
363,stathisvoukelatos,One of the greatest movies of all time,8,18 October 2010,"Kill Bill vol.2 is the second part of the epic called Kill Bill and starts from the point the first volume ended,with the bride driving to Bill in order to kill him and get her revenge without knowing that the baby that she had in her belly didn't die despite the fact that she was shot in the head,fact that comes in the surface in the end of the first volume.At the same time Bill(David Carradine) and his brother Budd(Michael Madsen)are discussing about the bride's coming in order to kill them.A long flashback ensues and we are going back in the place where the whole revenge thing started.The bride is revealing that it wasn't a wedding but a wedding rehearsal,while we are watching the scene when the Viper squad killed everyone in the chapel after the brief conversation Bill and the Bride had.After the flashback we see the bride attempting to kill Bill's brother Budd who is by the way a drunk-ass loser working as a bouncer in a cheap strip club.Unfortunately she fails and gets her body shot by a shotgun and in a weird attempt of Budd to kill her and make her suffer he buries her alive.After that we have a second flashback and we see the bride's extremely hard training with the Kung Fu Master Pai Mei.After the flashback the bride is escaping form her casket and goes after Budd once again.In the meanwhile Budd and the bride's worst enemy Elle Driver are making a deal considering the bride's katana.In a twist of fate the movie's ultimate villain kills Budd with her snake but after that comes face to face with the bride in an epic fight where the bride triumphs over Elle in a quite gory moment leaving her blind,but having found out that Elle had killed Pai Mei.Then she finds Esteban Vihaio,Bill's first fathering image or whatever they call it,giving her Bill's location.The following scenes are quite sad.The Bride finds Bill but not alone.Bill is with their child,the one that as i outlined above wasn't dead.After some touching scenes we are learning the reasons why the bride left Bill and in the end Beatrix Kiddo(The bride's real name) kills Bill with a move called ""Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique"" that Pai Mei learned her while training her.To sum up Quenitin Tarantino's Kill Bill is a single movie divided into two parts.The first part is violent,gory and bloody while the second part is violent too but has more dialog and emotion.The first part is a homage to the 70's Hong Kong Kung Fu movies while the second part is a homage to Spaghetti Westerns.To cut the long story short,Kill Bill is one of the best movies of all time and gets very close to Pulp Fiction's greatness.Thank you Quentin Tarantino,you are the Godfather of today's b-movies.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

I strongly believe there's no need on writing stuff about the premise or the multiple and very well used tricks he spent on it -besides, I'm pretty sure hundreds of others here are gonna do it-, so I'll keep it short and say that never mind whether you are a Quentin fan or not, this is a must to see, to appreciate, and to give to the word ""joy"" a whole new perspective and weight. You now The Bride is on Bill's track, her anger is the strongest will, and this, on Tarantino's hand, is spectacular. That's why both parts are no less than awesome.

367,oliver-123,Unanswered questions,6,29 January 2007,"Warning: very serious spoilers Well, now I've seen both halves, and as I suspected we wouldn't, we are given no answer to how the baby is retrieved from the Bride's supposedly dead body, without any trace of this being apparently visible to the law officers. This also brings up a major continuity error: she flees as soon as she is pregnant, Bill traces her three months later, yet she is evidently near term when the massacre takes place - where did half a year go? And there are more questions: how did Bill know she was coming, when the last he'd heard, from Elle Driver, was that she was buried? Are we to suppose that Elle Driver, even in her agony, warned him? (And what happened to Elle anyway? She was blinded, but not not killed) And were Elle and the other assassins so blindly obedient to Bill that they were ready to beat up and kill her and some perfectly innocent people - and why did he want them to, when he could have had the Bride taken out by other assassin methods)? And why did they disperse afterwards, one to become an ordinary mother, one the boss of the yakuza, and one (Elle) who knows what? So, though the acting is good (Uma Thurman's is great), this is even less satisfactory than Vol. 1, in my opinion. The fighting scenes are much more scrappy, less ""artful"" than in 1, and the most interest is generated by how the Bride gets out of her bonds and her coffin - which is actually reasonably plausible, if one accepts that her body was not searched.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Oh yeah, and a lot of the character touches.So that leaves Part 2 at a disadvantage as far as pacing is concerned. Admittedly, few movies could keep up the pacing of the first part without completely leaving any pretense of plot behind.So we get to alternate between current time and flashbacks... so much so that, at first, I got a little tired of it. But unlike Part 1, the flashbacks made more direct sense.And we finally get to meet characters that were waiting offstage in Part 1, like Bill and his brother, Budd.There's a lot of good stuff here.

Remember how you thought Bobba Fett was the coolest? That's because you didn't really know jack about him...If volume one was about action, volume two is about suspense and muted emotion. Drawing the audience in with gritty exchanges and gruesome action the movie takes a different kind of turn when Bill and the Bride finally come face to face.Great film with an interesting but dangerous nearing flat ending. The plot is running on the rim when it finally screeches to a halt with a satisfying spin out. An oddly delicate if uneven ending that recalls the final piano note from the Beatles ""Day in the life"" in that after a crescendo of mayhem your left with an open ended story and moral questions left unanswered.This film will be even better if it is ever cut together and viewed as one entire piece. I felt that cutting this movie in half was a bad (and greedy) Harvey Wienstein idea and really creates something lopsided.

371,LG72387,A Conclusion to A Masterpiece,8,14 August 2004,"It's hard to review Kill Bill, Volume 2 without mentioning Volume 1, since both films make up an entire movie. So instead of just reviewing Volume 2, I shall end up combining the two films and submitting a review of Kill Bill. So let us begin. Kill Bill is Quentin Tarantino's bloody epic masterpiece that pays homage to those 70's Japanese shows, Spaghetti Westerns and Italian Horror Films. He combines the three elements to create a masterful story of revenge, featuring Uma Thurman as The Bride. The Bride is an interesting character who is indeed a woman of the world. She was about to get married and have a baby and ended up being massacred by Bill and The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (composed of Elle Driver, Budd, O-Ren Ishii and Vernita Green) and left in a coma for four years. She wakes up and immediately wants revenge on all those who ruined her lives. What results is approximately 4 hours and 8 minutes (that's what you get if you add the two films together) of action-packed, in-your face drama that can't get any better. Quentin Tarantino is a masterful writer and director that one can compare to Martin Scorsese. He is totally original in what he creates and doesn't hold anything back from the audience. He shoves it in your face and all you can do is squeal when he does it. Uma Thurman delivers quite possibly the best performance of her career (the only one better maybe occurs in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction) and honestly richly deserves a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her work in this epic film. But what is really the centerpiece of this whole entourage of violence and blood is the character of Bill. One would expect bill to be such a hard-ass, a man so violent and so insane that you wouldn't be able to like him at all. Yet Tarantino creates him as an intelligent, sweet, loving man who feels sincere regret for what he did to The Bride. The man who plays him is David Carradine, son of the legendary John Carradine, whom, like John Travolta in Pulp Fiction, Tarantino resurrects with this film. Carradine plays Bill so well in Volume 2 that he too deserves a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for his work in this film. Tarantino's writing and direction are nearly flawless in this movie, the editing of the film is spectacular, the cinematography is absolutely stunning, all making Kill Bill a vast, beautiful tale that is more than just about revenge. Volume 1 was a bloody masterpiece, Volume 2 was a beautiful masterpiece, Kill Bill is One of the Very Best Films Ever!

372,JonSnowsMother,Disappointing,6,3 March 2008,The movie wasn't bad and i am not saying you should avoid it. But after a thrilling and great first movie i was expecting this to be just as good but even though Tarantino did a good job and some impressive acting by Uma Thurman. What the film lacks is the poor storyline. If you've seen the first film you will realise the lack of fights which was shocking enough.Like i said earlier the film has a weak storyline and the only way to make it better is a good screenplay and even though it starts off quite good it turns poor near the end.One thing the movie did do very well was the acting Uma Thurman and David Carradine give good strong performances. One problem with the movie is a big twist happens near the end and it is poorly done for such an important scene. This film isn't bad just that if you enjoyed the first film don't get so excited but i am sure most big Tarantino fans will enjoy it.,Kill Bill - Vol. 2
373,hani_78696,The Bride is back to Kill Bill,8,8 July 2013,"Well,as i have heard so much that this vol is much less action packed than the first volume but it perfectly succeeds in giving us the satisfying conclusion of a two-parter movie. Uma Thurman is awesome as always. This volume depicts David Carradine as ruthless Assassin Bill(Title Character),he is as tough previous volume has shown us. I liked the way it contains so much characters and presents us the Training of the Bride AKA Black Mamba by Pai Mei. The scene where she escapes from the grave covered in sand after which she goes to a coffee shop and asks the waiter ""May i have glass of water,Please? ""is quite funny. Again,This flick is full of references.Also,the one of references to the zombie and undead movie when she takes her hand out of the grave is clever. As i believe it pays a great deal of homage to the Western and old Chinese movies especially the training where the disciple learns from his master. When she plucks out the second eye of Elle,that scene is so Intense Daryl Hannah is quite the screamer. Michael Madsen's style is very decent as a typical Texas fellow who lives in a trailer park. Everything about this movie is quite good but not better than the First volume nevertheless it lands on a comforting climax which makes us happy and cheerful,not to mention B.B looks so cute and sweet. Great Job by every member of Cast and Crew. Thumbs Up.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
374,gravity3,A Return to Story Driven Cinema,9,16 April 2004,"VOLUME 1 of KILL BILL was really all about the action - a pure revenge film dipping into every '70's action genre one could imagine, and director/writer Tarantino can imagine quite a lot of them. There wasn't much character development, nor a great deal of plot. But that left more room for what it was really about - Tarantino proving his walk was as good as his talk. He had talked about action for years, and with VOLUME 1 he delivered; enough for any five action films, I think.So it was the return to an earlier Tarantino type of character developed, story driven film that really threw me in VOLUME 2. Now that's not to say there isn't any action. KILL BILL VOLUME 2 has got that covered. But in this one we study all the background, the motives, and the characters themselves. Mostly these elements are given in an old fashioned storytelling style, told from one character to another, in that kind of conversational realism Tarantino has made popular all over again, but which he and few others have really mastered. We are given many little storytelling scenes, about this or that - I'm not going to give anything away here. But it all adds up, at least to me, the way all those little storytelling scenes worked together for the whole in PULP FICTION.It's this storytelling element that really gives meaning and depth to all the craziness that was unleashed in VOLUME 1. It's clear how much the two films are actually just one story. Without the second, the first is just action fun. Characters doing crazy things to each other without much reason behind it. But with VOLUME 2, we have the scope and the motives and intentions of those actions. We finally get inside these characters, and that, for me, is the best part of the storytelling process. At the end of VOLUME 1, O-Ren Ishii might have been the only character I understood at all. Even The Bride was a bit of a mystery, and we didn't even know her real name. Now, I feel like I know them all. They are distinct, in the way perhaps the Magnificent Seven are, in my mind.Now I don't want to give the impression this is a slow film. It's quite a bit longer than the first, but the time just flew by and I was surprised when it was over. Wonderful editing and pacing are the keys here, not to mention riveting dialogue, and action that comes out of nowhere like a truck driving into your living room on a quiet evening. Tarantino still has the element of surprise in hand. And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the talents he's assembled in cast and crew. The film is just as clever to watch as the dialogue is to hear. Buddy Robert Rodriguez even makes an assist on the music soundtrack.Tarantino has once again bravely side stepped the industry trends, turned the formula on it's head, and delivered the more thoughtful, deeper elements in the second half of the story. The audience is then rewarded with a superior, unpredictable second installment that may leave those ""check-your-brain-at-the-door"" fans a bit disappointed, but gives the rest of us, as The Bride puts it, ""bloody satisfaction"". Well done.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
375,pocomarc,Terrific acting,9,9 February 2007,"I liked Michael Parks as the 80 year old retired pimp Esteban best of all here.The guy can act. His motions, his accent, the movements of his head were worth seeing many times over.Carradine's acting, voice were also very good.Michael Madsen had his role of a lifetime in Donny Brasco. He was good here as a laidback, failing character.To me the actress playing Kiddo is a tall skinny girl with a less than beautiful face. But she does her part well.The only jarring note in the acting would be Samuel Jackson's overdone, campy attempt at acting in a bit part.Am I wrong or is the movie about men ""disciplining"" their women?1---Bill shoots Kiddo in the head because she dumped him.2---Esteban says he doesn't agree with that and says Bill should have ""cut her face."" Then he calls over a girl of his with a face disfigured in such a way so Kiddo can see her.3---The martial arts master (almost all the posters here are so clueless when it comes to martial arts they don't know there is much to be learned from those scenes) runs a non-stop disciplining of Kiddo.There are two somewhat lengthy scenes involving food prepartion:1--Bud prepares the drinks for himself and Elle.2--Bill prepares the sandwich.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
376,ven2s,Rich dialogue and Fast action,9,24 April 2004,"The surprise of volume 2 is not just it's fast action and a very shocking burial scene/experience,but its rich multilayered dialogue.  It was a pleasure to hear the characters, especially Bill aka, David Carradine, in conversation with Uma Thurman's character, B*@#*~`%&!The volume is shear genious and should have been included with Vol 1 as, the director originally intended, one long film.It is a real treat for the eyes and ears and I highly recommend it!!!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
377,Flyer78,"One of my all time favorites, Tarantino at his best.",9,24 July 2009,"Kill Bill Volume 1 was a very enjoyable and fun film for me, but one of my main complaints was the same complaint many others had- The movie relied on vicious action, and told little of a story. Quentin has always been my favorite director, but even I thought that the only reason Volume 1 received so much praise was because it was a Tarantino film, and that fact somewhat blinded people of its true essence, and that was a standard action film with gallons of blood, although in fairness, it had one of the greatest action scenes of all time featuring The Bride vs The Crazy 88.But Volume 2 on the other hand is much different from the original Kill Bill film. You can truly see what Tarantino's purpose was when making these two movies, and he did not disappoint. Volume 1 set up all of the questions, and gave vague reasons why exactly The Bride wants to murder her former boss and ex-lover, Bill. And now, Volume 2 answers all of those questions, and goes into deeper detail as to why Bride feels such a strong need to kill Bill. To use an analogy, Volume 1 opened the box and dumped out all of the pieces to the jigsaw puzzle, scattering them all about, and you know very little concerning where to go from there. But Volume 2 joins up all of those puzzle pieces, and by the end of Volume 2, all the pieces are together, and it creates a beautiful picture.If you are one of those people who only enjoyed Volume 1 for the action and the actual storyline does not concern you, don't expect to enjoy Volume 2 as much as the previous installment. The second is much more intriguing and tells a much deeper story, as well as developing the characters much more. Don't get me wrong, there a few fantastic fight scenes in this film, but this is by no means an action-packed splatterfest.As for the acting, in a word, extraordinary. Uma Thurman outdid herself as The Bride, Michael Madsen did great as the character Budd (one of the best characters in all of films, might I add. He's so mysterious in a sense), and Daryl Hannah was fantastic as Elle. But folks, let me tell you- the late great David Carradine stole the show. He is nothing short of ideal for the character of Bill.Tarantino's Kill Bill movies are not for everyone, but then again, none of Quentin's films are for everyone. But I found this a very enjoyable film, and I think everyone who enjoys an intriguing story with heartpounding action, and a touching ending should without a doubt watch this film.Oh, and did I mention that the musical score Robert Rodriguez did was incredible? The only thing I can think of that was better was the score Ennio Morricone did for Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy. But let's be honest, will that score ever be beaten? You bet not.But back to Kill Bill. Awesome movie, watch it.9/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
378,deadmanjones,The Legend Continues.,9,2 September 2006,"Hitchcockian noir bids us welcome and 70s Kung Fu provides a wonderfully welcome aside, but above all this film wears its Leone / Ford Fan Club badge with even more prominence than the first instalment. Wondering whether it's as good as Volume 1 is fairly pointless, because this truly is one film in two volumes. Maybe the second film isn't as energetic as the first, but that's to be expected from a conclusion, and the film never really disappoints. It still manages to cram in a scene more horrifying than the hospital bed scene from volume one, & it still manages to have a fight scene even more brutal and cold. If you have no soul you could, at a pinch, say it is less fun than the first. But it's an operatic climax that is deserved and needed and which you'll applaud. Bloke in front of us did anyway.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
379,benturkalj,Great ending to a brilliant epic,10,7 October 2005,"Kill Bill Vol 2. is an awesome conclusion to a great movie double. If you liked the first one, you should definitely get a kick out of seeing the remaining members of the viper squad killed.This is more like a Tarantino of old, and has all of the witty dialog we have come to expect from the modern master. There's a great deal of it to, but that is not to say that there aren't any great fights in this. If anything, the battles are just as enjoyable here, though they are certainly more concise.Everything about this film is fantastic. The acting is great from everyone, particularly Madsen and Carradine. The characters have a load of depth, much more then the first part, and even the lesser known characters will be remembered. The score is up to the usual high standard, with some really cool references to some other classic films by a certain Western Director.If you are able, it is best to watch the two flicks back to back: both are easily some of the best to come out in modern times. An instant classic.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
380,preposterous,9 out of 10,9,5 March 2005,"I wanted to give it a 10 of 10, but the truth is that it wasn't as sublime as, say, Hitchcock's Vertigo, so I couldn't do that. However, it was only when I saw Vol 2 that I realized the extent of Quentin's brilliance in composing these two back-to-back blockbusters. Considering the length of these films, esp when laid back-to-back, it is amazing to me the mastery Quentin has over his material that not a moment is wasted. Far from it, every moment is poignant with some kind of word, action, music, or other, and it all fits like a dovetail, like a man who knows what he's doing and is going about it with a sense of purpose. I've been a fan of all his films until now, from Reservoir Dogs to Pulp Fiction to Jackie Brown, and I can say that it was worth the wait.As for the acting, as usual the casting is superb. Unlike the usual parade of stars, Quentin finds the people who've been out of the limelight for sometime, or were never quite in it, and somehow or other they are great actors and actresses in front of his cameras. This time, for me, it was David Carradine who was the surprise. And there were many other great performances throughout, but of course this is blondie's movie. I don't think there's a moment that goes by with her on the screen that I am not filled with lust and desire for her body and her soul.This is an absolute masterpiece and my only question is: when's the next one Quentin?",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
381,clearwinner,A sequel more powerful than its predecessor,8,18 September 2014,"I loved the second part of the seres more than the first part as it gives the how the murder which led to all the events in the future happened. The characters are thickened and given a more meaning than the previous part. Ah! the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic. I mean The action movies are about the soundtrack but in this soundtrack captures the moment and emotions perfectly. The lead character's past is shown in this part and thus it appeals more and clearly shows how she evolved in the process. Even her relationships are shown, the face off between the assassins and the lead character are just awesome and the final end scene and the end are marvelous. The end conversation between Bill and Black Mamba answers all your doubts and closes all the loose ends.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
382,konky2000,"Great moments, but so much gabbing...",7,16 April 2004,"Basically Quentin Tarantino is the Jimmy Page of our day. Page was a great musician and Led Zeppelin made some great songs, but that doesn't mean I have to praise his 30 minute 'Dazed and Confused' guitar solo. In a similar vein, it is not an insult to Tarantino's skills to say that Kill Bill 2 is about 30 minutes too long. There is genius to be found, but unfortunately this is one of those 'Dazed and Confused' moments where QT's self indulgence is trying the patience of fans such as myself.I could easily name 3-4 scenes that could be removed or shortened considerably -- scenes that added almost nothing to the story and served only to slow the pace of the film. The film itself might have been a dreadful bore if not for a sensationally choreographed showdown between Elle (Daryl Hannah) and the Bride (Uma). The scenes of Uma's kung-fu training were equally entertaining and were beautifully integrated into the story as a whole.Too many times, though, we are forced to sit through another one of Tarantino's signature 'Royale with Cheese' moments: meandering conversations about trivialities that are meant to draw out the tension by delaying the action scenes. Well, the technique is starting to feel like a schtick and just doesn't work so easily for me anymore.I am disappointed, because within 220 minutes that make up Kill Bill 1 & 2 are two sensational 88 minute films that coupled together would represent a great moment in stylish moviemaking. As it stands now, though, we have Tarantino standing on stage playing his triple necked guitar with a violin bow -- we are mightily impressed Tarantino, but just so you know, you had me already with the double necked guitar.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
383,MildInconvenienceMan,"This is a good film, it relies to much on the first film, and did not have nearly enough action, and that is the thing that would have made this film great",6,17 October 2012,"This film was good, but in my own eye it was not as good as the first film in the Kill Bill series. This fundamentally rested on the ending of the film being an anti climax as well as the fact that this film focused to heavily form answering questions from the first film, and so did not have as much action or storyline, instead it consisted mainly on flash backs. The flash backs were useful as to figuring out things about the 'bride' character, as well as showing more links between the assassin group. Unlike the first film, most of the deaths in this film were disappointments as compared to the last film, they all were quick and there wasn't any of the intense fighting sequences that made most of the first film. Although music was integrated well into this film, I again feel that it was better in the first film, and that this film was more of a disappointment. The lack of more cartoon imagery used was again something that made this film look worse in comparison to the first film.I only wish that more action had been put into this film, and more interesting shots to bring the film to life, especially in the flashbacks which were fairly frequent. My main problem with this film was the second half, as practically all action had ceased by then, and we just got pure mother issue with her daughter, this part was far to accentuated and although I enjoyed Bill as a character, I would have much preferred to see more of his so called amazing fighting skills.Therefore all though this is a good film, it relies to much on the first film, and did not have nearly enough action, and that is the thing that would have made this film great.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

385,grandpagbm,Interesting -- It Surprised Me,7,3 November 2008,"I am definitely not a fan of Quentin Tarantino. The only films of his that I have seen are the two in the Kill Bill series. I was interested in seeing them primarily because Uma Thurman and David Carradine (in the second one) were the leads, with an interesting supporting cast.This second film in the series is not nearly as bloody and violent as the first, although there is plenty of both. The dialog between David Carradine and Uma Thurman at the end of the movie is fascinating, a complete departure from the action leading up to it. Carradine's performance is as excellent as Thurman's. As in the first, the selections of music are very interesting, fitting the different segments well, but also representing odd choices. I was most surprised by the very end of the film, which neatly tied up all the loose ends and had a storybook finish. This was not what I expected from Tarantino. It was a pleasant surprise.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
386,addicott,More subtle than Volume 1 (what isn't?) yet almost as much fun.,9,23 March 2008,"Kill Bill Vol. 1 is by far my favorite movie in recent memory. I've seen it 4 times and I still love every second. I love it for its outstanding boldness and relentless intensity.Volume 2 is quite different from volume 1  that should be a given. Originally conceived as a single movie, one shouldn't expect the second half to mirror the first, especially when it's written and directed by Tarrantino. Don't expect another sassy knife fight or Kung-Fu bloodbath  expect the unexpected.This pertains especially to the pacing. Volume 1 was fast and furious but Volume 2 is more contemplative. There's more word play than sword play and all the characters get ample room to blossom... before they are killed.Everyone is colorful and amusing. Tarrantino has a way of simultaneously building fondness and contempt for the players, such that when one heavy back-stabs another, you feel a mix of elation and annoyance. Go ahead and like someone, but don't get too attachedKill Bill is brimming with great performances, any one of which would single-handedly carry an average movie. Michael Madsen is Budd, Bill's estranged brother. (The two have a complicated relationship.) Although he appears to have gone tender, Budd is not to be under-estimated! Larry Bishop is hilarious as the sleazeball boss of the strip club where Budd is slumming as a bouncer. Darryl Hannah plays Ellie Driver, a truly bitchy villain you'll love to hate.David Carradine is the charismatic Bill. (aka: The Snake Charmer) In the opening sequence of Volume 1, we saw him at his very worst but most of the time he is surprisingly pleasant to be around. But by his own admission he is a murdering bastard and he seems to have a knack for royally pissing people off. We see this with his former mentor Hattori Hanzo, his brother Buddy, and most especially the film's protagonist, The Bride (played of course by Uma Thurman).Uma continues to dazzle as she did in the first volume. Seldom has a heroine been cast in so many different lights. Depending on the scene, she can look plain or glamorous, confident or vulnerable, exuberant or despondent. Her moods go all over the map but they're always convincing.There's a few very cool dual roles. Gordon Liu played the ""Crazy 88"" commander from Vol. 1 and in real life he's the fight choreographer. In Vol. 2, he plays Pai Mei, a lonesome hermit who is the high priest of all martial arts. (Apparently Tarrantino dubbed the voice in Cantonese!) It's highly amusing to watch him put Uma through her paces. (This sequence also helps to illustrate how Uma's character became the deadliest woman in the world and is able to prevail in one particularly hopeless situation.) You won't even recognize Michael Parks, who was the Texas Ranger in Vol. 1.Volume 2 relies heavily on dialog. This has always been an exceptionally strong point for Tarrantino and he comes through as strong as ever in this picture. It takes some strain, however, to reconcile the more cerebral high of Volume 2 with the sensational absence of subtlety in Volume 1. You have to shift mental gears to appreciate the entire package. It's well worth the effort.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
387,rogerhwerner,Those Coming Late to the Party and are Watching on DvD Watch Both Films Back-to-Back,7,6 July 2021,"I took the time to read the many reviews from when the film was first released. I was honestly not surprised by the negativity. When I watch a film I do my best to get into the director's and actor's heads to try and understand a film's back story. This is especially important with a director like Tarrantino who doesn't just mindlessly present scenes. Tarantino uses every scene to make a point and often these aren't obvious. I repeat: every scene has a purpose.The single most important thing to understand is the Kill Bill is an homage to the Shaw Brothers Hong Kong-made 'Chop Sockie' films, the Spaghetti Westerns of Sergio Leone, Ennio Morricone's grand soundtracks, 1970s Japanese samuri TV programming, and even Robert Rodriguez's 'Once Upon a Time in Mexico' trilogy. Personally, I love homage, and so for me I rewatched both films perhaps a half dozen times just to be sure I picked up on all of them.The film is non-linear but it doesn't jump around creating confusion. The linearity of the film is occasional broken up with flashbacks, which are strategically employed to explain the heroine's actions. One thing important to keep in mind is that Tarantino doesn't expect anyone to take either film completely serious: neither did Leone or Rodriguez. In fact, the best comparison would be to opera, with it's demonstrative acting (and over acting) and especially its melodrama. Wheras Volume 1 was rather filled with edged weapon splatter and loads of fighting, Volume 2 is far more thought-provoking but in both the behavior of the actions of the characters shouldn't be seen as normal human behavior. As in the John Wick films these people live in an u real bubble that permits them to behave in ways that would be riciculously impossible for the audience. Tarantino demands that we suspend disblief for the duration and follow his characters. If we do that these two films become highly entertaining and engrossing, and at times even very touching and sentimental in the classic sense of the best 'B Movies'.Some reviewers harp about the ending, calling it anticlimatic and disappointing. In rreality it's neither. I suppose the more simple-minded expected and wanted to see a climatic sword fight between chief antagonist Bill and the vengeful Beatrix but that would have been unfortunate had it occurred. Instead we see something else; a rather surprising end to Bill and Beatrix. The Bride gets her revenge but as with almost every instance of revenge she learns that it's double-edged. The Chinese saying goes: before setting out for revenge first dig two graves. Beatrix achieves her ultimate revenge but she pays a price. The viewer might consider what that price may be.One could spend a lot of time analyzing character behavior but since much of it is psychopathic, it's likely to prove unsatisfying. In their own ways each of the characters is nasty but with a few notable exceptions they have their moments of humanity and when they occur they've almost jarring in their incongruity. Watch for them! And be sure to watch all the end credits since the film doesn't conclude until Robert Rodriguez's final tune ends and there are a few important details therein that help explain the characters. Tarantino expects the audience to tune out during the credits but those who do will end up missing explanatory details.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
388,jusco15,jusco's review: Kill Bill: Vol. 2,7,24 December 2010,"Was I satisfied with the finale of Tarantino's epic 4-hour Kill Bill (I combine Vol. 1 and 2 because you can't watch one volume and not watch the other; it's the same as watching just half of any film)? Yes. Did Vol. 2 reach the high standards set by Vol. 1? Not quite, but nevertheless it was still entertaining. Immediately, you'll realise that there is more talking and less action than in the first volume. Several things happen: The Bride deals with the final two assassins, a flashback of her martial arts training with a Chinese master is shown and we finally get to see Bill (his face was unrevealed in the first volume).The pace significantly slowed down in comparison to its predecessor but it does relatively manage to maintain the suspense just enough to keep us riveted. A long-drawn flashback to the events that occurred in The Bride's wedding chapel was much too lengthy for its own good and unnecessary. The Bride's interaction with the last two assassins felt a bit disappointing. This time, it is China and its martial arts that provide the bulk of homages in the film (the first volume being Japan), presenting Pai Mei, the legendary master who teaches The Bride.But it is David Carradine that shines as Bill. My first impression of his performance as the titular character was that it felt much too unnatural, too over-acted. But overtime, I came to accept that it was unusually fitting of the ruthless nature unique to his particular character. The way he talks, every move he makes seems perfectly calculated. We come to understand why people fear him. Bill is deadly, make no mistake.Though not as commendable as Vol. 1, Vol. 2 brings sufficient closure to one of Tarantino's greatest films. It was an exceptional ride and you can only feel happy for The Bride at the end. People ask what's the point of this film; but then again, our world craves senseless violence, so I think I can confidently state the reason why this film is so popular is because there are a lot of people out there entertained by excessive violence. The threatening consequences of our dying morals is a topic for another time. I suspect this full-length feature inclusive of Vol. 1 and 2 was made for the sole intention of gratifying Tarantino's infatuation to create something that is just shocking and purely violent. Talk about intense self-indulgence. But if we were ultimately entertained, I guess that can be pardoned.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
389,mtrburrows,On par with Volume 1?,8,4 August 2018,"Kill Bill Vol. 2 is the more Tarantino-esc of the Kill Bill movies, with less emphasis on action (although Vol. 2 has my favourite action scene from the 2 movies, that being the trailer fight) and this time I greater focus on his trademark dialogue and character building. While the Bride stole the show in Vol. 1, this time it's Bill who's the standout, with the actor having the perfect balance of charm and creepy that makes you buy his history with the Bride.This movie also has one of my favourite Tarantino moments, which makes one inch punching look like the most badass move ever invented by man! Overall, Vol. 2 acts as a very satisfying conclusion to what Vol. 1 set up, and while it may be slower, it's just as memorable, and just as rewatchable.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
390,dbrookfield,A contrary opinion,4,19 April 2004,"I like most of Quentin Tarantino's work, a lot.  And this movie has a lot to recommend it, particularly interesting camerawork and photography.  You don't see a whole lot done with overexposure and backlighting like you do in this film.  The quirky, Mamet-esque at times, unusual dialogue is at times a bit much for me but I got it in the cartoony way in which I am sure it is intended.  But I think some of the quirkiness of QT's films comes from Quentin himself, and this is a guy that is a bit too self involved for his own good much of the time (at least on the talk shows that I've seen). Ultimately, this movie suffers from that in some of the excrutiatingly slow, labored speech that is intended to be dramatic.  Maybe this is in itself part of the cheese factor that this movie embodies, but between interesting bits, action, and comedy are vast boring wastelands of ""Eyes Wide Shut"" slow paced dialogues.  Making so much of the dialogue in this pace simply isn't good art in my view, there is a whole palette that can be used.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
391,Johnny0581,Excellent follow up to volume one,10,6 March 2005,"In Kill Bill Vol 2. Tarantino has focused more into storyline, characters and plot and given a little rest to the blood and gore of the first one. Making this one stand out and in my opinion surpass the first one. Once again the story picks up where part one left off, The Bride is still thirsty for revenge and has three more people to finish off, leaving last on the list, the most crucial of them all, Bill.This time around, the movie follows a more spaghetti westernish path, and leaves the chop-socky, kung fu tributes a little bit behind. That's mostly in part because the targets are different and now most of the action takes place in American soil. This time we also finally learn The Bride's real name. Next on her list, is the white-trashy, trailer-dwelling brother of Bill's, Budd, played excellently by Michael Madsen, in his best role since Vic Vega in Reservoir Dogs. Budd is the only male member of Bill's killer squad. This time around we also find out why Budd is living the kind of life that he is, and are even taken on a little trip to his workplace to really see what his life has become after leaving the squad. This time around we also learn how The Bride learned to kick ass the way she does, by seeing her taking a trip down memory lane while she's in a sticky situation of life and death and for about twenty minutes or so, we go back to the kung-fu, chop-socky tribute, and meet a new character in time, Pai Mei played by legendary kung fu actor Gordon Liu. We also see in action for the first time, the other member of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, and only worthy match to The Bride, Elle Driver played by the still beautiful Daryll Hannah. Seeing Elle and The Bride's fight on screen is one of the best seen in recent Hollywood movies but the best part of the movie comes when The Bride finally finds Bill.I have to say, even for a role that was written specifically for him and that has somewhat to do with his earlier work, David Carradine still does an excellent job playing Bill. His charisma and coolness make him a natural at this kind of role. And speaking of coolness, one of my favorite actors, Sam Jackson, also makes a very brief appearance at the beginning of the movie that goes almost unnoticed, but as always he's great even if it's in a teeny little cameo. This movie, in true Tarantino style, is filled with great dialogue, in my opinion, the greatest since Pulp Fiction. Also, once again Tarantino chooses the perfect music for his work. The spaghetti-western music from classic films also blend with the movie perfectly. In conclusion, this movie delivers in all levels, action-wise, comedy-wise, story-wise, and dialogue-wise. So there is something for everyone in this movie. This one, along with volume one, make their mark as one of the first classics of the 21st century. 10 out of 10.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

This movie lacks of everything the first movie had: Suspense, good action and interesting ideas like i.e. the anime part. On the other hand it has everything the first didn't need: Lots of gibberish dialogue which prolongs the movie endlessly. It all would have been a great 3 hour movie if u packed the first and second part together. If you get to rent the dvd I would recommend watching the deleted scene.

In part1 that wasn't a real problem because the movie was fully action packed and full of interesting passages (i.e. the anime part) This is completely missing in the second part.

It has some of the best dialogue written especially in the last parts of the movie when Bill and Kiddo finally meet. Their interaction is what makes the movie special it gives us an insight into what makes them who they are. Bill is cold and has a heart at the same time, Kiddo is deadly yet vulnerable and has a difficult time speaking her emotional state. This is most evident when Bill drops by the Chapel and her hesitation and fear is displayed by the frantic looks and tone changes Uma thurman uses, the Bride is most human then. Both movies are a one destination journey, the most touching part is her journey as a warrior under the tutelage of Pai Mei. This is where we catch a glimpse of the warrior that Kiddo really is, and what makes her different from all the others, she has a deep honor and respect for tradition. This casts her in a superior mold to Bill as a warrior, who is cunning and fierce but lacks the dedication Kiddo has for she has an honor code they all lack.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
396,MrBook,"Different from Vol 1., but still good.",9,26 May 2004,"I keep hearing everyone bitch about how Vol. 2 was ""boring and didn't haveenough action."" It definitely does not have the amount of action as Vol. 1; but what it lacks it action, it makes up for in character development and dramatic tension. Watching the Pai Mei sequence, which I particularly enjoyed, showsthat Tarantino has watched a lot of the old HK flicks (the shooting style and the use of snap-zooms were perfectly mimicked). It would also seem that DavidCarradine is back on the ""cool list,"" as Tarantino seems to do with many actor's (especially one's with the faltering careers). A very satisfying second half to the movie. 9/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

OK, but superfluous.",6,28 April 2004,"I enjoyed KBI immensely, despite the square peg in a round hole anime section and some typical Tarantino trademarks I could live without, but I had a feeling that the 'sequel' wouldn't live up to it. Like the Matrix, I was right.From the number of 10/10s this is getting, obviously other people think I'm wrong. But this should never have been a separate film. The amount of plot and action that we're treated to here could have been squeezed into the 40 minutes easily excisable from volume 1. And then we might have been spared some of the crap QT inflicted on us in both volumes (David Carradine's monologue, for instance). Viewing the two in one sitting might improve matters, but that might also highlight the filmmaker's indulgence. I give it 6/10, because I liked the music and the fights, but it's becoming increasingly obvious that QT will never better Pulp Fiction.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
398,CJXzoic1970,One Point,10,12 August 2004,"Interesting - in post 9/11 I found the most unrealistic point of this movie (KB1 and 2) is that ""The Bride"" can move so effortlessly from the USA to Japan and back to the USA and then to Mexico and back not only slaying dozens of people in her wake - with no police on her trail - but more amazingly she's relaxing on the plane rides with a huge Hanoi Sword!!!! They arrest you @ the airport now with a letter opener!!!   What - did she slay the Marshalls and stewardess and hijack the plane to get to her destination??   Why wasn't the Air Force and Marines waiting for her when she landed??  Homeland Security failed us on this one!  But then we would still have Bill running around.

They sat me down hours before and made me watch the first film before right away going to see the second. I am not the biggest Tarantino fan but I must say I was impressed. The violence was awesome and it reminded me of an old kung fu movie with Uma Thurman. Like most of his work vols 1 and 2 were unoriginal. Compilations of older films Tarantino rented when he worked at a movie store. Except at least vol. 1 had beautiful action. Vol 2. was a waste of time. If 1 was a high budget kung fu movie 2 was a low budget western complete with slow dialogue and the insertion of long long hesitations. I did not like this movie. It appealed to pimple faced, twenty-something year old film students across the world who could dissect it and analyze in their film studies 101 and talk about how great it was. But to an average joe like me I though it was bad. It was boring and anti-climactic. I like solid movies, I love to kill a mocking bird and cinema paradiso, I don't just like violence. But if vol.2 was supposed to be more dramatic it should have had more substance. And vol 2 lacked substance.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

What was the point of Michael Madsens character visiting his workplace?

Tarantino continues in full swing with his tributes to classics such as Leone's Westerns.  The first time Uma comes face-to-face with Carradine it cuts to an overlong showdown effect, why?  It works in a western whilst you're waiting to see who makes the first move, but it's completely unnecessary in this Kill Bill scene.I stopped watching this when Uma manages to punch her way out of a coffin from 6ft under, it truly is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and is very had to believe its from the same director as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction!1/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
403,hughie522,"The sun's still shining in Tarantino, USA...",3,24 August 2006,"I've never been a big fan of Tarantino films. I watched 'Jackie Brown' a few years back, heard good things about 'Reservoir Dogs' and watched the first half hour or so of 'Pulp Fiction'. Enough said.I came to 'Kill Bill Vol. 1' primarily as an outsider. I had sort of an idea who was in it, what the tone was and that it was meant to be a homage to '70s Hong Kong martial art flicks. And as an outsider I thought it was really good; it was enjoyable. So, I'm expecting the same for 'Vol. 2'. Because I figure 'Terminator 2' wasn't a 120 minute talkie, and in fact built upon the action and the violence of the first, and 'Vol. 2' will be the same. How wrong I was. As a non-Tarantino fan, you can enjoy the first film. As a non-Tarantino fan, you'll be falling asleep in front of 'Vol. 2'. There's 30 minutes of talk...just talk, mind you...and Bill is dispatched very easily at the end (I'm glad that actually happened, otherwise I would have given the film a 0). I'm willing to give the first film an 8 (yes, I'm that generous. Though I don't think I can give the second more than a 3. It was a waste of time, and nothing like I thought it would be.But, apparently, this is how Tarantino makes movies. He makes Tarantino movies for Tarantino fans. He's a great filmmaker, I'll give him that and the first film was spectacular. But the second film felt more like an episode of 'Days of Our Lives' with one decent fight scene. Don't waste your time, I say. Fortunately for Tarantino though, he can do no wrong, and unlike Uwe Boll fans will continue to flock to his movies and praise him. Non-fans, however, will probably be tuned out for good after 'Vol. 2'. What a waste...",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

405,XFLRWF,Tarantino's Martial Arts Masterpiece,9,21 April 2004,"With the brilliance of a gleaming samurai sword, `Kill Bill: Vol. 2' shines as an outstanding conclusion to its 2003 predecessor.  The second part in the revenge epic from writer/director Quentin Tarantino takes a breather from the stunning, over-the-top action sequences of Vol. 1 to focus on the origins and backgrounds of the characters.  This does not by any means take away from the film's greatness or viewing satisfaction.  Audiences and fans are still treated with a clever script filled with sharp, philosophical dialogue complete with powerful and emotional acting that is common in Tarantino's movies.  Having left his trademarks all over `Kill Bill: Vol.1', Tarantino finally completes his tribute to his adored martial arts genre in his own captivating style.Four years after she was unmercifully beaten and left for dead by her former assassin cohorts, the Bride AKA Black Mamba (Uma Thurman) returns to the United States to finish her quest for vengeance.  Wanting to leave her old life behind her and settle into motherhood, Black Mamba was busy with her wedding rehearsal.  Unable to let her enter her new life, Mamba's former boss and beau, Bill (David Carradine) orders her execution by the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, Lucy Liu, Vivica A. Fox).  Following her recovery, Black Mamba sliced and killed her way down her hit list while encountering near-death circumstances and vicious villains.  When Black Mamba's journey ends, she must not only face her old master but also the ace up his sleeve.Director Tarantino incorporates the same ingenious and unique filmmaking style that he carried out in `Vol.: 1.'  This fact comes as treat for the patient movie fans that have waited for the film's continuation. Utilizing his trademark jumps between time and space, Tarantino employs this skill with even more precision.  Each time jump ties in directly with the scene that it jumped from in the present time.  This direction gives the audience a better understanding of how and why the heroine arrives at each of her circumstances.  Lighting also plays an important role in the film. Tarantino's use of light (and sometimes lack thereof) is a key factor to capturing the characters' emotion in several scenes.  The lighting provides the audience with a better tool to comprehend a character's thoughts and feelings and gives the audience a special viewing experience.The collaborated script of Tarantino and Thurman contains even more concepts from martial arts cinema and are incorporated with Tarantino's amusing views on life.  Whereas the first film focused on incredible sword fights and eye-popping effects, `Kill Bill: Vol. 2' is more character driven while still containing a good amount of fighting and swordplay.  It is in `Vol. 2' that we learn more of how the characters came by their skills and the relationship between Bill and Black Mamba.  A beautifully done scene in which Carradine entices Thurman with his flute playing while regaling her with a tale about his former teacher not only integrates the kung-fu style of filmmaking but also explains the closeness once shared between the couple.  The exceptionally hardcore Tarantino aficionados will particularly love the director's comic book explanation on humanity and finding oneself.
Uma Thurman continues her Oscar worthy performance as Black Mamba.  In the role, Thurman plays not only an expert killer but also a human being. Thurman's character is not the typical heroine who is infallible and unfeeling.  Rather, she has fears when she is beaten and feelings of both love and regret on her quest.  Thurman's portrayal is so powerful that passion of her performance is emitted through the screen.  The audience can sense her every thought and feeling as she struggles through dire circumstances and the elation of her victories.  David Carradine is the perfect mix of coolness and ruthlessness as Bill.  In `Vol. 1', Carradine's voice carried out his performance.  In `Vol. 2', the audience gets the privilege of seeing how acting matches the action.  Carradine's rendering of Bill is not that of a callous fiend who kills without any remorse or logic. Instead, his actions are from the knowledge and acceptance of who and what he is.  Carradine performance of this realization is done in such a matter-of-fact manner that one would almost believe Carradine was speaking of himself.  Carradine also pulls are rare feat by evoking a small piece of understanding and sympathy for the criminal.  This is accomplished through the terrific on-screen chemistry between Carradine and Thurman.  Carradine brings about the sincere love Bill has for Black Mamba that it makes the shooting seem more as a crime of passion than a crime of hate.  Equally impressive are the supporting roles of Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen as Elle Driver and Budd respectively.  Hannah is deliciously evil as Driver. A complete 180 from the beauty roles she is known for playing, Hannah's Driver is out for herself and will crush anyone who gets in her way.  Her performance as the deadly killer is a villain colder than the other side of the pillow.  Hannah plays the role with such ability that she rivals many femme fatale roles.  In a similar 180 move, Madsen's Budd is not the sadistic, torture-loving villain that the actor has been known to play. Rather, Madsen portrays Budd as a down-on-his-luck con who is always looking for a quick buck.  Although the character is not extremely vicious or confident, Madsen still manages to exert his own charisma into making Budd a worthy character.`Kill Bill: Vol. 2' has all the action and witticisms that movie goers loved from `Vol. 1.'  Tarantino's unique eye and camera direction gives the film life and the incredible acting talents of his cast bring the screenplay into being.  Tarantino's kung-fu masterpiece is so incredibly well done that it almost seems a shame that the film was cut in two.  But each volume is a work of art.  Tarantino's tribute will not only stand as one the greatest and meticulous films ever made but may just secure a place for the maverick director in the kung-fu hall of fame.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

That's very good indeed. The style is different, less camp, more cinema. Sometimes it's a bit slow, but QT seems to always work it around to the film's advantage. The dialog is pretty good, it contains some great stuff and some fumbles. If you saw Vol. 1 and you were not put off by the violence, then you'll have little problem with Vol. 2.

The reason merely being the connection of the story and characters (even though not much). Important thing was Bill actually was a good character and my favourite characters in the movie. Because he feels like one of us. Too sentimental, possessive and optimistic like every other being. David played it brilliantly. I wanted this movie to be more longer and passionate than it is.

409,mattdvs,A satisfying conclusion to the epic,8,20 April 2004,"Tarantino makes his return to the talky action movie genre with the second part in his Kill Bill epic.  The first, naturally titled Kill Bill Volume 1, followed the Bride, a former assassin played by Uma Thurman, as she exacted bloody revenge on her former colleagues.  All we learn in the first movie is that on her wedding day, while pregnant, Bill, the Bride's boss, and his gang of DiVAS (Deadly Viper Assassination Squad) ambushed the wedding and massacred everyone.  They presumed to have killed the Bride, but they failed and instead left her in a coma for four years.  After waking up and teaching her muscles to move again, she begins her rampage to kill all those who wronged her.  The first movie concludes with the Bride killing the two bottom-tier assassins in the squad along with sixty-something bodyguards. At the end of Volume 1, we learn that he baby survived and, unbeknownst to her, was taken in by Bill and raised as his daughter.  We didn't know who any of the characters were, why they wanted to kill the Bride, or really anything at all about Bill, the charismatic leader of the gang.  Volume 1 was a hyper-kinetic action movie that only really took pause once, to explain how the Bride got her samurai sword.  It was a great film, but felt pretty superficial compared to any of Tarantino's others, in that one of his trademarks is the intimacy the audience feels with the characters.  The two volumes were supposed to come out as one movie, but as shooting went on, Tarantino and Miramax realized they were gonna have a four hour action movie on their hands, and so they decided to cut it into two more manageable chunks.  After watching Volume 2, it's hard to believe that Kill Bill was ever supposed to be anything but.If Volume 1 was supposed to just introduce us to the story and then watch the characters kill each other, Volume 2 explains all the whys.  Volume 1 was all action; Volume 2 is all talking.  This isn't meant to be a bad thing, however.  By the end of Volume 1, we wanted to know why we saw what we just saw.  In Volume 2, Tarantino explains it to us.  This serves to make us more connected with the characters.  We really care who lives and who dies.  And, the greatest thing about Volume 2 is by the end, even though we know what a heartless, murdering ba****d Bill is, we kinda like him.  We don't even like him in that villain-loving way, where we want to see him get his comeuppance.  We honestly like him and kinda wanna see him and the Bride (later revealed to be named Beatrix Kiddo) end up to raising their daughter together.  Obviously, as you can probably tell by the title, this doesn't happen.  No spoiler warning necessary there.This is quite a feat for Tarantino to pull off, given everything that we've seen before the end and knowing full well Bill and his cronies did everything to kill the Bride in several heinous ways.  This is what makes Kill Bill Volume 2 a fantastic movie.  By making us wait to have our questions answered, our sympathies change and change again throughout the story.  Yes, it's a talky movie, as every Tarantino movie up until Volume 1 was, but the dialogue is largely interesting and only serves to give every character some form of dimension.  Don't go into it expecting more of the same ultraviolence and gore as we saw in the first one, but rather with the attitude of trying to find out why all the ultraviolence and gore was necessary.My ratings (out of ****):Volume 1 Writing             *** Acting             **** Direction          ***1/2 Action                 **** Overall             ***1/2 Volume 2 Writing            **** Acting              **** Direction          **** Action              ***1/2 Overall             **** Entire epic Overall             ****",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
410,autumnshowers,"Miserably dull, hopelessly bad taste...grow up Quentin!",1,23 May 2004,"I suppose that with rewrites from an actual writer, this material may have congrued into a cohesive and useful story -- blending action and drama; however the two have been crudely separated, with the first film stuffing reels of comic book fake action play, and this second film little more than insipid, manipulative melodrama that would better find its home on daytime soap. Scene after scene represents an insult to good taste, with children manipulated and threatened by soulless creeps, and vast acts of cheap thrill-kill sadism. A scene from Tarantino's Dusk to Dawn comes to mind, where he plays a psychopath that kills young women: the scene contributes in no way to the plot, the writer simply appears on screen, commits a grotesque act, looks pleased (and aroused) by it. That scene seems to be an accurate summation of Tarantino's muse or the man himself. When unfettered by actual writers, he is given over to gluttonous indulgence of sadism, supposedly as...entertainment?Wrestling Fans Only -- that should have been printed in bright red letters across the movie posters of these silly, callow films. Any adult viewer ought to be insulted. Each scene requests we lower our standards a bit more, accept less, permit more poorly acted, terribly written, implausible drivel. This is below the level of freak show material, below the worst Stephen King horror film. Banal, trite, pedestrian...ridiculous!

It's even more rare to find a film that has all these qualities often on the screen at the same time. ""KILL BILL Vol. 2"" is the second half of one the best films of last year. Originally meant to be a four hour epic, KILL BILL was split in two volumes. Vol. 1 amazed so many people and this film does even more than that.KILL BILL is a homage to martial arts and samurai films that writer/director watched as a child. Both volumes constanly change genres which makes them even more amazing to watch. Vol.1 started as a 1970's revenge flick, then becomes a samuria film, and a japanese anime, where gore erupted in which limbs and heads flew. Vol.2, in the other hand, is more about story, character development, acting, it has a western feel to it, is a fun kung fu film which makes it even better than Vol. 1.Many critics and moviegoers were turned off by the lack of depth and often cartoonish nature of Vol One. This is one of the reasons why KB should of remained one film, thats what people say but I think splitting it into two volumes was the right thing. The thin but exciting characters of V1 become more human in V2. What starts off as a stylish and exciting action film becomes more of a dramatic film for the ages. As we learn more about the backgrounds for each character, we start to understand them, like them, hate them, and finally, connect with them. Volume 2 has less violence than V1, but does it mean is less exciting. It's a richer, deeper and overall, an amazing story-line. The final themes are not revenge, or justice, as were those in V1, but love, courage, suffering, and what the future holds.With these themes aside, KILL BILL is downright fun to watch. Uma Thurmans ""The Bride"", who was a killing machine in the first one, has some layers revealed here, and she becomes a warrior with purpose. Uma definiteley deserves alot of notice, come oscar time I hope she gets a nom. Not many actresses can potray this angry and violent character but shes does a great job at it. She becomes a memorable and heart breaking character here.The rest of the cast deserve alot of notice to. Micheal Madsen, here becomes a great villain in a film with other great villains in it. Darrly Hannah is even better as Elle Driver, who was the brides main rival when they were both assasins. Her and the bride face off in a exciting fight which had the audience laughing, screaming, and covering their eyes. Then there's BILL. In V1 we never saw his face which made him mysterious. He's played by David Carradine, BILL is one of the most complex and involving villains since Darth Vader. As much as we despise him at first, we get to know him through flashbacks, we kind of start to like him a bit. What the bride and BILL both prove, is that within every killer, there is a nice person hidden. Carradine is excellent. Another fun character is Pai Mei, who in flashbacks trains the bride through some amusing scenes.What more is there to say about this film, well edited, shot, acted, written, and directed.

415,burrobaggy,Puts the 'no' in 'Tarantino',3,24 April 2004,"What a letdown. After months of waiting, we're left with a drawn-out, badly written, undercharacterised anticlimax. The action scenes are poor, the plot developments predictable, the characters uninteresting and even QT's supposedly legendary ear for dialogue is revealed to be made of solid tin - was there ever a worse last line for a major movie? And were there ever so many poor performances in one film from a supposedly major director? Carradine shines only because he rises to the giddy heights of being average in such poor company (Uma is especially bad, and the extremely unflattering photography doesn't help).KB 1 was an okayish but wildly overlong actioner, but there's nothing here to match the silly but mildly exciting House of Blue Leaves finale. What that means is the big action climax actually happened at the end of another movie or halfway through this one when it's put together.

I would consider Kill Bill Vol 1 about the same in quality to Reservoir Dogs, whereas Vol 2 is similar to Pulp Fiction. Since I think Reservoir Dogs is better than Pulp Fiction, I then also think Vol 1 is better than Vol 2. But it is just fun to split hairs like this, since all 4 are great.But Vol 2 is a splendid movie, completely different in style to Vol 1, but just as great. It was just one of those movies that I wished would never end. It is one of those few great movies where I didn't want each scene to end because it was so interesting and memorable.It's just fun to see a director at the top of his game, and it is amazing how a director can make 5 movies (well 4 if you count Kill Bill as 1 movie) and have 4 of them be instant classics.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

It's just that you can't help but wonder why this has to be a separate movie. People expecting sword fight galore and chopped off limbs by the dozen will be sourly disappointed this time around. KB2 feels like it consists of 90% (cool) talk that isn't all that interesting. Sure, the bride clears a few things up about the wedding and her relation to Bill, but this is what we expected. And that is right where the crux lies. There is no suspension whatsoever. The bride will get her revenge and Bill will die. Surprise! Of course, it's not always necessary to have plot twists or elude the viewer, Titanic never made you guess twice either.In the words of Coleridge the ""suspension of disbelief"" never set in. You may argue that this is no requirement for a good movie but I digress. I kept looking at the time index and wondering when this will be over because in spite of all its shortcomings KB2 has a great soundtrack, excellent camera work and tries its best to achieve the QT coolness factor.Cutting both films into one would have set the right pace for one hell of a QT movie and not two mediocre ones.5/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
418,parsleylion,critical response to self-indulgence,6,7 January 2007,"There's a lot of fat in these movies Kill bill vol.1 and vol.2 that is too much narrative explanation, just cut to the chase Mr. Tarantino please! the action is great, the violence is unnecessary, the story clichéd and spread too thin to make this 2 1/2 hour film worth bothering with. It was geeky self-indulgence. I watched the Maltese Falcon just before now there's a master piece, short, to the point, well acted and not a flatulent moment in the script unlike with Kill Bill which is just stupid in comparison. There's no mystery, no subtlety, no intelligence, no charm and no cool. The whole premise seemed to come from that parody TV pilot in Pulp Fiction about fox force five except this time the foxes are snakes etc etc. so to sum up this film has a story that is way too thin, the film is way too long but the action is really good. This is a B movie with A action far from a classic its made for TV parody material with little to warm to in it, just sass from an ugly American. Pai Mei would not be happy at all. Thank me I never paid to see this gaudy flick.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
419,ster2001,Where's Lee van Cleef??,4,17 April 2004,"As neither a rabid fan or a detractor of Tarantino I must say I enjoyed the first vol. better simply because the action propelled the story and didn't give you much time to think about how thin the plot was. And there really isn't much here to make you care about any of these characters. The scene with the killer and the home pregnancy test where we're supposed to care about the bride fell totally flat.I'm sure this film is going to get TONS of positive reviews simply because Tarantino is one of the only original filmmakers able to command big budget films these days and fans will fawn over anything he does because there is no else to fawn over. But it seems people only respond to action and kinetics in films and not on plots and characters, which is sad because it is possible to combine both and Tarantino has the talent to do it if he'd only grow up a little. This is a lot of fun but it's not a masterpiece in any sense.Carradine is great and so is Michael Parks with a superlative job doing a Mexican pimp. Also If you're going to use music from other films take it from obscure films. The music used from the Good the Bad and the Ugly(it's in the top 100 best movies on imdb for christ sake!) is so recognizable its almost blatant plagerism to use it. I was expecting to see Lee van Cleef ride out of the desert and Kill Bill. Now that would be something!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
420,dave_wlogan,Not lacking in action but great character development,10,17 July 2008,"I thought Kill Bill Vol. 2 would be just like Vol. 1 but i was wrong. Despite the first film being a classic, this is what Vol. 2 needed. Tarantino films are all meant to provide something different to audiences with each film. Vol. 1 gave us the great blood bath Tarantino film, in truth like all his films its a homage film, and Vol. 2 gives us a chance to see inside the minds of the masochistic characters. The best of which I think is Budd (Madsen) who portrays a remorseful assassin who has given up the high paying world of killing to live alone and work at a titty bar. Bill (Caradine) is a killer with only one regret, shooting the Bride (Thurman). But the more interesting thing about Bill is that he accepts who he is and tells others to accept who they are. Elle Driver (Hannah) gives us the most bad-ass female to grace the screen ever. Elle is completely cold to all but Bill which makes for some interesting altercations with other characters. The Bride's character is explained and some others are introduced such as Pai Mei (Lu) who is the one of the Brides most influential mentors. This film isn't deprived of action. Elle vs the Bride has plenty of that but there is no denying that this film is a homage to revenge movies and even spaghetti westerns to a degree. An exceptional and more dialogue/character orientated sequel.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
421,Daelock,"Less Action, More Plot Makes This Series a True Epic",9,19 April 2004,"My summary says it all, the sequel to Kill Bill Vol 1 packs in more plot for the sake of the huge battles of the first one. Not to say there aren't great fight scenes in this one, but none are quite as enormous as the Crazy 88 fight. However that was what was holding back Kill Bill from being a real ""epic"" and just kept it in the realm of being a ""really awesome action flick,"" a lack of any plot or backstory or even real character development(except for O-Ren), however this picks it up and goes into tons of backstory and develops all the main characters to some extent. I feel that, while many may be disappointed at the lessening of action, many more will enjoy the fact that this is what makes Kill Bill a true epic, plot where it was needed.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
422,guillermotorofan,Vastly Superior to the cartoon of a predecessor,10,23 December 2005,"Kill Bill Voulume 1 did not impress me. Sorry, but I was not happy. I thought a great story of revenge was ruined. Tarantino handled the first film like a demented road runner cartoon, with an overly goofy soundtrack, cheesy deaths of much blood splatter, its impossible stunts(of course an homage to old kung fu flicks). Now I didn't hate volume 1 (I would get the DVD)yet it caused me to see this film with much trepidtude. WOW!Acting-10/10 Lovely Uma Thurman was really my favorite thing in Kill Bill 1, and she returns in this one with an even better and ore human performance. David Carradine is utterly fantastic as the title character, bringing a cocky output of his handling of the bride, but also a torture of losing her. Finally in comes Michael Madsen as my favorite character(Budd) and performance in the entirety of Kill Bill (excluding the main two of course). He plays a tricky character, at first he you feel sorry for him. He (like The Bride) seems to just want out, and put it behind him. You begin to feel as if he doesn't deserve his fate. Yet then he swings around full tilt, blasting The Bride off his doorstep so fast. He now acts like the bad guy he is, and all you could want is his death.Writing-10/10 Tarantino spins a fairly simple yarn that works and flows. Get revenge. Most of QT's work takes place in his direction.Direction-10/10 This time round Quentin has outdone himself. This film has such more of an emotional pull. This time it is much more emotional, and really at times stunningly beautiful. It really moved me. And of course all these Tarantino-isms from the first are here, but like everything else in volume 2 is smaller. This time around it is much more serious in exposition. In fact Tarantino has brought me and ending I find as unpredictable as The Sixth Sense. Expecting a big sword fight and god knows what I was surprised. Bill is killed quickly, getting the chance to get up and walk to his grave. Many people claim you can't say one Kill Bill is better than the other as they are basically the same film. NO! They are not the same at all. They are completely different, and this time Tarantino has left me pinned to my seat. Bravo, extraordinary work...",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
423,Dr.Jolly,"Good finish, should've been one movie",7,18 April 2004,"While I've read that Tarantino had no intentions of breaking the movie into two at the start, I'm sure he's not too upset at the reward of being #1 in the box office twice for the same film. The ending took where Volume 1 leaves off and runs with it. This film is not as action packed. Despite my love of Tarantino's work with dialogue, there are times when the talking seems to go on too long.
 Nevertheless, excellent work from Thurman and Carradine. Daryl Hannah played a role I didn't think she had in her and Madsen delivers his typical performance.  This film is for Tarantino fans only. I fear those outside our group wont get it.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
424,mewmewmint-1,Are you kidding me??,1,3 April 2006,"This movie was a total letdown. I was expecting it to be a lot better because I loved the first one. Vol 1 was awesome. Vol 2 sucked. If Tarantino would have called volume 1 ""Kill O-Ren Ishii"" and ended it there, I would have been MUCH MUCH happier. This movie wrecks the first one. If I could I would erase it from existence, and then erase everybody's memory of it ever existing. I don't mind there being a bad movie. But when it ruins a perfectly good movie by association, I mind that a lot.Volume 2 is a complete waste of time... I was so disappointed by this film that I can't even give it more than 1/10.If they took these two movies and put them together, people would say it's too long and they should just hack off the last one and a half hours, THAT is how bad this movie is compared to the first. It is dead weight.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
425,cmivie,QT's best since Pulp Fiction!,9,20 January 2005,"I know that it is rare to have a sequel that is absolutely better than the first film. Many feel that Spider-Man 2 is better than the first. The same goes for The Empire Strikes Back being better than Star Wars, and Godfather 2 being better than The Godfather. And the reason why these films are viewed as superior efforts over their original counterparts is simple............these sequels have their own identity. They have their own story to tell. And that is exactly what makes Kill Bill Volume 2 better than Volume 1. True. It does continue from Volume 1. True, the theme for both movies is the same......revenge! But Volume 2 is not in any way shape or form like Volume 1. It possesses more depth than the first film had. And the dialog in volume 2 is the best I have seen in a film since Fargo (and that is saying a lot.). But what really sets this film above Volume 1 is due to one person............David Carradine as Bill.I loved how you never saw Bill's face in the first movie. This strategy only built up the anticipation for when you do finally see him.....which doesn't take long once Volume 2 begins. But how we first see Bill is where the tone of this film is set. He is calmly playing his windpipe, and once he turns to look at The Bride, he commands your attention from here on out. What really struck from his first five or so minutes on screen was how Carradine displays sadness, happiness, and anger all wrapped in one. We know that Bill is gonna kill her, but the way Carradine portrays it, you suddenly find yourself wondering if he really will. You also get the feeling that Bill does not want to kill her, yet he knows that he has to because (in his eyes) she betrayed him. I loved the final lines they shared at the church, where she asks him how she looks. He touches her and looks at her like he is a proud father, and tells her she looks like she is ready. That is powerful, and what is really great is how these two lines come up near the end of the film. Truly masterful.Uma is solid as The Bride, and she shows why she is one of the best actresses in Hollywood today. She never gets the credit she deserves, and my hope is that these two films will give her that credit. Before these films came out, I had my doubts as to if she could pull off a performance like this. I'm glad to say that she proved me wrong. She is The Bride, and I don't think anyone else could have played her better.My only gripe with this film comes down to some believability issues. I won't go into any details, but you'll know what I am talking about. Still, these are minor gripes that do not take away from the movies ""greatness"".All in all, this is QT's best work since Pulp Fiction. I only hope he doesn't take another six years to make another film.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
426,noilie,# 117??,1,11 August 2004,"So sad that this awful, clumsy pastiche of clichés should generate so much sycophantsy in favour of that horrid little man Quentin Tarantino. This film has not even been out for five months and already it is at #117 on the list of IMDb top films of ALL TIME (!?!). If you want to watch a REAL Western as opposed to a facsimile of a Western, go and watch ""ONce Upon a Time in the West"" or even ""The Searchers"" again. Those films are difficult, trying, multiple meaning-generating masterworks. Those films still seems fresh, this one is tired and show-offy, without having a real sense of CiNeMa about it. ""Pulp Fiction"" (Tarantino's only good film in my opinion) is worthy, watch that again and tell me that this is not a vastly inferior work. Tarantino's cinema has always been plastic, self consciously fake, but at least Pulp-Fiction dares to have fun with its genre-bending tendencies. This film is merely a compendium of spot-the-film-references, with a couple of snide, jokey one liners to compensate. It is a fashion magazine-like tour through the landscape of the Western and other less respectable genres (as observed in terms of the 'centre', that dreary institution known as the AFI).Granted, it is nice to see interest generated in older and less-known genres by younger generations, but all this does is to highlight how much better those films are and how intellectually bankrupt endeavours like this are. It is for this film to be informed by the history of cinema, but not for it to merely lift from that past willy-nilly without adding a iota of insight or critical meta-commentary of his own. QT, in my opinion, is a brat who deserves a spanking with a large wooden paddle. He may embody the Northern Californian ideal; a proud loudmouth, not coy about much, self consciously playing a role to his adoring fans, a natural entertainer, the grand high poo-bah of all film nerds (or ""cineastes"", whichever is preferable). That would be fine, if the films were any good. They're not (beyond ""Pulp Fiction"" which, as I have stated, is an unqualified masterpiece). There is a lot of myth-generating riding on the quality of that ONE film. Unfounded. And no, dear fans, I am not 'just jealous' (a childish retort which seems to be bandied about quite often at sites like this).",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

And before you blink an eye, Bill is killed in 5 seconds. Very disappointing. Too bad the insufferable kid wasn't killed either. Don't listen to those who says part 2 is better than part 1.

432,bibleboyiam,Perfect Way to End His Masterpiece,10,26 April 2004,"Kill Bill Volume 1 blew me away. It had such an impact on me that I saw it twice within 12 hours when it first came out. I had to see it twice to believe it. The music, costumes, visuals, anime, and bloodletting were too much for me; I instantly fell in love. I didn't think that it was possible to fall in love with a movie, but Tarantino proved me wrong.
I very anxiously awaited the release of Volume 2. I had never been so excited about the release of a movie in all of my life. Then it happened, April 16th 2004; Kill Bill Volume 2 was opened to the public. Opening night I went to see it with such hope of a continuation of the first half, an adrenaline rush of hip music and intense action. Then the movie started. The first hour or so I sat in the theater waiting for a repeat of Volume 1. It never came, and I was o so disappointed. I left the theater in utter disbelief wondering how the film, or half film, of my lifetime (Volume 1) could possibly be concluded (Volume 2) in such a way as to disappoint me. It wasn't until the next morning, after a night of mental processing, that I realized Volume 2 was PERFECT. Volume 2 was everything that Volume 1 wasn't; an ideal compliment. I had to see it again. Upon second viewing, my post-movie-going euphoria rivaled that of Volume 1. (For those of you who disliked this film after seeing it one time, I strongly recommend a second run through)Tarantino knew exactly what he was doing with this project. He hooked audiences with the delicious sinful superficial pleasures of Volume 1, then smothered the same audiences in the rich textural storyline of Volume 2. Like a parent-child relationship, he knew what I needed, and gave it to me against my ignorant wishes. It was only upon the subsequent epiphany of maturity that I realized that he had my best interest in mind. God bless you Quentin!In Volume 1, the characters and the fates that they suffered affected me very little (this includes The Bride). The film left little room for emotional attachments, as viewers were filled with adrenaline and utter disbelief from the visual gluttony that they had just experienced. Tarantino knew this, purposely squeezing out every morsel of storyline and character development in order to please the audience's lusty desires. Yet in Volume 2, my empathy for every character was overflowing, as once again Tarantino had fulfilled his goal of over stimulation, only this time in the opposite direction.Tarantino took a great risk in creating this project and releasing it to the world. To make such a film work takes an ultimate amount of skill and passion. Luckily for us all Tarantino has both. Now that all is said and done and the entire world of Kill Bill has been revealed to us, there is nothing left to do but marvel in the brilliance of it all. We have to put it all away and move on with the memory of it in the back of our minds. But we will always remember that this is what cinema is all about.

Wrong move!!! There were a few nice action sequences but it was like watching paint dry waiting for them.  I'll go ahead and mention spoiler alert now since my comments may spoil it for those who enjoy this type of movie.  I nodded off a few times so they might have answered the only question I had which was how Bill got the daughter from the pregnant mother he tried to kill.  By the time they showed the daughter, I really didn't care.  At least 30 minutes of useless dialog should have been removed.   It even took an eternity for Bill to die.  And why was Uma crying after striking the fatal blow???  It was about as dumb as her going after everyone with that sword even though she was an expert marksman with a gun.  Although LadyKillers wasn't as funny as I had hoped, it was the better movie of the two.

The films are simply not good. Yes, they are stylish and have some great action sequences, but the dialogue is poor (unusual for Tarantino), the plot uninteresting, and large swaths of the footage wasted.  I understand he dragged it out in order to split it into two films, but to me, the best part is still the very first sequence of the first film.  It would have made a better single film; instead we get two pieces of drawn-out schlock.KB2 is most noteworthy in that the body count and gore is way down from the first film.

437,ivanm-5,Much slower than Vol 1 but a satisfying conclusion to the story,8,11 May 2004,"Kill Bill Vol 1 was an out-and-out comic book romp, full of violence but always with tongue firmly in cheek. The violence count is severely reduced in Vol 2 but arguably more disturbing. The big difference is that Vol 2 is about the characters rather than the action. Here we begin to find out who these people really are and that, despite there penchant for assassination, they are real flesh-and-blood human beings. The result is that expectations of another high-speed violence-fest are dashed but the seemingly chaotic events of the first film finally get explained. The pace slackens quite markedly towards the end causing an audible amount of fidgeting in the theatre where I viewed it but sitting it out to the end is well worthwhile. As before, Tarantino presents the story in a variety of film styles, my particular favorite being the black-and-white Film Noir that opens the movie.

I'm only 16, and had never watched a Tarantino film before so Volume 1 seemed quite bizarre. With that in mind, I still enjoyed the film but volume 2 is a totally different experience. Tarantino focuses more on the characters and storyline more so than spectacle, but still provides the audience with tension packed fighting and toned down blood and guts. Uma Therman is absolutely terrific as 'The Bride', giving the character emotional depth, but still with the same brutality as Volume 1. Kill Bill Volume 2 is unique, different and amazing entertainment. A sensational film that lives up to all the hype!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Yes, it takes some of the stock characters from such films and makes some great plays on them, and yes, it integrates this well into the story (even if it is amazingly cheesy).However, to watch Uma attempt to look proficient in hand-to-hand fighting is truly an unpleasant thing, and takes away significantly from the movie. I didn't realize until seeing this movie how well-edited vol. 1 was -- watch it again. You won't notice how incredibly awkward she is, because the cuts are so good that all you see is quick action, not her swinging that katana. In vol. 2, you see all of that in-between, and it turns out it's a VERY good thing we missed it in 1.Were it not for that, this could have been an acceptable conclusion. As it is, if you have any kind of background in martial arts -- or even martial arts movies -- you will probably find this film very hard to take seriously, even as a parody.Extremely overrated. Watch at your own risk; you may end up with an aversion to the first one as well, as I did, which is very unfortunate.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
440,bigfella2k1,Outstanding,10,18 April 2004,"(Contains Spoilers) Well, after waiting first till February, then March, and now mid-April to finally see how this revenge fantasy plays out, I finally saw it last night, and guess what? This blows away Vol 1. for me. The characters are more fleshed out, we finally understand the Bride (and Bill's) motives for revenge, and believe it or not, Tarantino ultimately delivers a love story (albeit a sick, twisted and massively dysfunctional one.) Michael Madsen was amazingly sympathetic as Budd, an ""alkie loser"" you feel sorry for because he realizes he deserves whatever he gets. I loved Daryl Hannah's evil Elle. I haven't liked her in a movie like this since, well, ever. The fight scenes are sparser than in Vol 1, but the Budd/Elle/Bride showdown is definitely worth the wait. (Don't open the suitcase!) Again, Tarantino pulls out his bag of cinema tricks- we get scenes with rear projection, shot in b/w, grainy color stock for the kung fu scenes, credit fonts from the thirties, etc. The final showdown is surprisingly brief, but still satisfying. Uma Thurman has never been lovelier, and the movie holds up well on its own as a separate piece from Vol. 1- amazing. This and the Dawn of the Dead remake are my favorites so far for 2004, but it's hard to see how anything could surpass this. 10/10.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

442,wiseguymattt,Perfect sequel,9,21 September 2013,"I wrote in my review of Kill Bill Vol. 1 that perhaps in the second film there would be an explanation as to how the Black Mamba became so skilled and what really was the root of her deep hatred and anger towards Bill. Well, in the first we can easily deduce that because Bill and his crew shot up the wedding and left Beatrix in a coma that she was more than entitled to her revenge. I found it profound how much we learned about Budd and how unworthy he is to be part of the DVAS. Honestly, I wonder how the hell he earned his place. What was his specialty other than being a greedy smart alec? I digress. Kill Bill Vol. 2 wraps everything up near-perfectly. The Bride already has a couple names checked off on her list as we come into the second film. Budd, Elle, and Bill are all that remain and let's just say Copperhead and Cottonmouth were like the warm-up laps before the race, the real competition. Each of the remaining DVAS members have unique challenges to offer Beatrix. I don't know how to put into words how perfect this film is. From beginning to end you're wondering what's going to happen next. And everything that does happen is so well thought out and fits the characters so perfectly that it adds so much more depth and appreciation for the movie. The ending may or not be what you're expecting. I'll just say it was both for me. It was a beautiful ending. These two films taught me a lot about honor. Obviously it's all fiction, but just like in Kill Bill Vol. 1 when Copperhead and Black Mamba are fighting in the house and the school bus pulls up, Black Mamba chooses not to fight in front of the little girl. She knew her beef was between the girls mother and that the little girl wasn't aware of how deadly and evil Copperhead truly was. That is just a very mild example of how, despite the overwhelming hatred Black Mamba harbors towards the rest of the squad, she still has the ability to be better than a mindless killing machine. Her enemies are highly-trained fighters. Each confrontation is like the beginning of a symphony and all you can do is sit back and let the melody of the swords carry you to the final heartbeat of either Beatrix or her foe. I look forward to a possible third installment!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
443,StayPuft003,Wow... Again,9,8 June 2006,"What a well made film. Following the first amazing volume of Kill Bill, I had no idea what to expect. What I got, was one of the best films I've ever seen. There is much more drama and good dialog in this Volume than in the first, much less action, and much more character development. You find out the full story of Beatrix Kiddo (AKA The Bride AKA Black Mamba AKA mommy) and it is just as jaw-dropping as the story told in the first half. The black and white is used to perfection, and seeing it in color would make it worse. The acting in this movie is superb, as in the first, especially by Michael Madsen and David Carradine. I've never seen Madsen play a character so subtle before, and it really works. The dialog is sometimes amusing, and although this is not nearly as amusing as the first movie, which was hilarious (mostly due to the raunchy action), there are some very funny moments in Volume 2. Pai Mei is officially the coolest character ever in a movie, mainly because of his beard, and every character has depth and a style of their own. The cinematography, just like Volume 1, is nothing short of spectacular and the directing is, well, it's Tarantino, so its gotta be great. All in all, this movie is film making at the highest level, and is quite the joy to watch on screen and remember off screen.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
444,FreddieLee04,Kill Bill Vol.2- A Tarantino Gem Which Is An Improvement Over The First Volume,10,10 April 2020,"I consider myself a huge Tarantino fan. I love Reservoir Dogs, constantly find myself quoting Pulp Fiction and have even sought out some of his lesser known flicks such as the mishmash Four Rooms. Yet, Kill Bill Volume 2 is the one I find myself always wanting to rewatch time and time and time again.
There is something for everyone in his 2004 follow-up to what I believe, is the fairly mediocre Kill Bill Volume 1. Sprinkles of japanese culture (mostly displayed in Vol.1), elements of western movies and homages to the great Sergio Leone, and tons of mesmorising dialogue from a range of unique and well-developed characters.Uma Therman is superb just like the first film portraying 'The Bride'. Michael Madsen and Daryl Hannah make fantastic side-villians who help create memorable action scenes and moments such when Buck burries Beatrix alive or when Ellle Driver gets her eye plucked out, leaving her blind. It is these tense, nail-biting scenes that really improve on the first movie, which at times, feels like an all-out kill-fest.The star of the show for me is the late David Carradine who brings both lovable and loathable qualities to the titular villain 'Bill'. He is also a monumental asset to the film's success in my opinion, which contains the most memorable and heartfelt ending in Tarantino's filmography. The 'five-point-palm exploding heart technique' might just be the most inventive way of killing a villain i've perhaps ever seen. Also, the credits are bound to bring a tear to your eye.In essence, there is no need for a third installment- no matter how much my heart wishes that I could get see Beatrix fight again on the big screen- the ending of this one is perfect.

445,gsprods,Dynamic Villains,10,20 January 2005,"They say action film thrillers are only as good as the bad guys. We got 3 of the best right here. David Carradine (doing his best work since his ""Kung Fu"" days), Daryl Hannah (her 1st villain role -she's awesome) and Michael Madsen (doing what he does best... torturing people!) Carradine as Bill is not who we expected him to be after watching the 1st film. He's cool but he has a lot of humanity to him as well. As his brother Bud, Madsen puts Uma Thurman through one of the most claustrophobic suspense scenes in film history (Madsen, so calm and relaxed, does his best acting since his ""Reservoir"" glory days). And Hannah squares off against Uma in a spectacular catfight, a battle to the death amongst 2 of the cinema's reigning 6-foot blonde goddesses. This is a great conclusion to the stylish Kill Bill revenge saga.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
446,sideburnmikeguitar,Had it's ups and downs,5,12 March 2008,"I'll spare the details of the plot because there aren't many and you can read the synopsis. Basically Uma Thurman's character wants revenge and wants to kill Bill. There's other people too, but...it feels sort of inconsequential to me. I don't really buy the plot so it was a bit of a let down. I think the way the story is told impresses a lot of people, but I just don't find it that clever.I don't see how people can truly say this was amazing or horrible when you take in all the elements and judge it on artistic basis. However, just as a general asthetic I can understand people hating it. I am certainly not one of those people...it's interesting to see why people seem so polarized though.Camera work: great. No argument there from anyone. I do'nt see how you could complain about how this is shot. I didn't read the credits that far because I have no idea who these people are and don't honestly care. But whoever it was, he really brought out the best of what was there.Acting: pretty damn good considering there's rarely any depth. In spite of such an absence of substance--which anyone in their right mind recognizes--Thurman and Madsen say a lot more when there's no dialog. Carradine's good, etc.Script: OK. Some people seem to miss Tarantino's overwrought loquaciousness. It would've gotten in the way here...and on the ocassion that it creeps up it continues to get in the way. They're killers not 2nd semester English majors (the kind Quinten puts in every other movie apparently).Plot: Yeah who are you kidding? It's kind of fun though.Action sequences: Cool at first, and fortunately there's enough focus to keep you drawn in. Nowadays it seems like there needs to be 15 cuts per second to convey action instead of letting us watch the actual fight. Kudos for not following that trend. On the other hand these become a cliché unto themselves pretty quickly for me.Style: Look if you want style over substance then go the full way and make it a joke. I think of this movie as an over-budget, less funny, more colorful ""Story of Ricki Oh"" about half the time. Either put more substance in next time or leave it out.Pretty much middle of the road in terms of quality for Tarantino, but usually I tend to feel his movies fit the extreme. A little more work on the plot would've taken this much farther.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
447,bryanus,Even more detail,10,15 November 2009,"This film definitely adds a lot of detail for a hungry palate left over from the first one. If you have any questions unanswered from the first one, this film definitely answers them. The lush scenery is absolutely amazing. And you also get a real mystical sense that anything is possible (taking into account the kung fu aspect of it, which is learned and practiced by the Bride). There's a real spooky element to various aspects of the film, and the film really succeeds in drawing the viewer into its story. There is also a vague feeling that this movie is about a decade ahead of its time in terms of artistry in general, and especially of independent films. To put it simply, not even one tenth of the stuff shown on IFC or Sundance even holds a candle to this film and the previous. Well done!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
448,abjerg01,The some sort of underrated volume,10,29 March 2013,"I thought the first volume was great fun, and you can tell Quentin had fun making it too. But to me, Vol. 2 felt a lot more 'complete' and well-rounded than the first one, which was action- packed and quite messy in my honest opinion. Vol. 2, although not filled with action, it was the most enjoyable for me. It was dramatic, beautifully choreographed, and of course well-written. Every QT-movie is well-written, but because this relied less on the action, and more on the dialog, it felt like it was better written too. So what Mr. Tarantino has done here, is quite amazing. He has made two movies, which are one complete story, and belongs together as a whole - but still managed to make two movies in the complete opposite directions. So it all comes up to which mood you are in. If you want something quiet and dramatic, throw Vol. 2 on ... and if you want something that's more action- packed and fun, throw on Vol. 1.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

I adored the first volume and I think QT is one of the best film makers, hands down.With that said: This movie stunk. It bored me to death for the whole first half. Once The Bride starts her training with Pai Mei...it gets better, I admit. Until that point, though, I was really ready to walk out. In fact, I had BEEN ready to walk out about 20 different times.I do think this film picks up about half way through. So I can give it that much credit.My suggestion is to rent it when it comes out, that way you can fast forward through all of the crap and get to some decent scenes.

How possible is that she didn't even suspected that she had a daughter but instantly believe she has one when seeing a child with Bill!! I just don't get it, did Bill know that its his child before trying to kill her? Because if yes, why shoot her in the head? why kill his daughter? If not, how did he know? He realized when he heard ""it's your b...""? Now, that's the worst explanation. I mean, the characters' motivations are absurd! And yes, a lot of clichés! Intentional, unintentional, the result is just boring! I fail to understand why the movie is highly rated! Last thing, every second in the movie, I hate her more.

Her ex-colleagues find her some months later at her wedding and slaughter everyone, but she survives and this movie is about her revenge.This is classic Tarrantino.  For me, this is his best work yet.  It is a real tribute to story telling and a tribute to Hong Kong Kung Fu movies, Japanese Anime and the all time great, Shogun Assasin.  I loved the inclusion of Shogun Assassin at the end of Part 2.  O'ren ends in the same was as the Masters of Death.Authenticity was preserved in the use of Chinese and Japanese artists and it showed.  From the story of O'ren in Part 1 to the final death blow in Part 2, the telling of this story rests on the pedigree of the action best story tellers.I loved it.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

I don't believe Uma at all. Carradine... his lines were well, but please don't even dare making another ""fight"" scene like that (come on, you were better even in ""Future Force""!). On the other hand, both Michael Madsen and specially Daryl Hannah (thank you dear, you looked and performed much better than in ""The Job"") rob this film. Straight into what the film is, the first volume was excessively violent, somewhat bizarre, and I called it (in my ""The Job"" comment) a ""fun crap"". this second one explores the inner side of The Bride, and all comes to an end in a long, dull, and boring way.

457,kgdakotafan,Kill Bill Volume II,9,1 October 2009,"Many fans wonder why Volume I and Volume II weren't compacted into one big movie. After seeing this, I realize why. The tone of the movies are so different from each other. There is way less cinematic sampling in this volume and more focus on dialogue and character development. The audience is asked to deepen their care for the characters. So many of the questions that the audience wondered about in the first volume are answered here. We learn about how Beatrix ""The Bride"" Kiddo fell for a nice, record store working loser. She did it because she wanted her daughter to start with a clean slate. We learn that his daughter is still alive, and we learn why Bill wanted to kill his former girlfriend. In the film, a story called ""The Legend of Pai Mai"" is told from Bill to the Bride when they are dating. It's about a woman who didn't recognize her husband's graciousness and left him, and he tried to kill her but failed, and she got revenge. That was an interesting metaphor for the movie as a whole. Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) is a sick, twisted, wicked dog but makes for a kickass character, and the music towards the end evokes many strange emotions.

Therefore, if you see one without the other, you'll be a measure disappointed.  I was careful to watch KB Vol 1 on DVD three times (with subtitles to catch every word) prior watching KB Vol 2.  Like others that commented, I thought KB Vol 2 was slow off the start, which is not to imply err, when the ending is pulled together so tightly and so satisfyingly as it was.  I was simply euphoric by the movie's end and felt that way through the rest of the night, pondering and tingling from the satisfaction that the movie delivered.In my view, the bloody fun that was KB Vol 1 is an 8, the satisfaction of KB Vol 2 is a 9 ... but as one movie, KB Vol 1-2 is a 10.The Bride, Uma:  I bow humbly.  Darryl Hannah is brilliantly fearsome and garners tremendous respect as the California Mountain Snake (this IS the same girl that was in Splash, isn't it?).  David Carradine, WAS Bill incarnate.SPOILER: Only in the final 10 minutes of the movie do we see just how human the Bride and Bill are. It's a familiar story--one that most all of us can relate to--only Bill and the Bride take it to the extreme ... Bill for his jealousy, the Bride for her revenge.  Finally, I thought the Bride's pleas of ""Thank-you"" at the end of the movie is a very moving moment--telling that there was a higher power that got her to the place she was and she knew it.  Her narrative in Vol 1 even mentions ""God justifies her revenge, even demands it"" (paraphrased). Pretty cool, eh?",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Bill explains why the Bride was supposed to be killed off and the four year-old daughter of Bill and the Bride makes an appearance near the end.There are some funny moments but this episode is far more laid back and less interesting than the first one.

I came away very disappointed with the ending of Kill Bill V2.  The first three-quarters of the film had me captivated, but it completely lost me once the Bride got to Mexico.  Half an hour of predictable and uninteresting talk and then a criminally short end fight.  After sitting through four hours of KB, I had at least expected a spectacular ending, but instead we saw a very short and amazingly predictable fight. Some of the acting in KB2 is awful. Michael Madsen, although very charismatic on screen is one of the worst actors I have ever seen, and seems lost unless he is doing the one emotion he has mastered, menace. 
Many people have been raving over David Carradine, and to be fair his performance when judged by his usual standards was pretty good, but when judged against a decent actor, would only appear mediocre.  Fortunately, Uma Thurman, Daryl Hannah and Gordon Liu are all awesome, so the film isn't all bad.I'd give it 6/10.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
461,Shred_Master,"One of my least favorite Tarantino films, unlike Vol 1.",5,9 July 2017,"OK, so I know that kill Bill is meant to be one film all together but it ended up that they did two volumes, which are very different, so it makes sense to review Volume 2 on its own.Without saying too much about volume one, it is one of my favorite Tarantino flicks - the action, the dialogue, the music, the acting, etc. I remember being very excited about volume 2 coming out, then it didIt's not that I mind Tarantino going in another direction per se but everything that was awesome about volume one, he completely changed for volume two. The first thing that I noticed right away was the music. The score and the soundtrack for volume one fit every frame perfectly. For volume two, I felt the music was very off-putting. The action is volume two was very much toned down. It's not that there wasn't any action but the few action scenes that occurred were nothing compared to the spectacle in volume one. Even the final fight between the bride and Bill, was very quick and very unsatisfying. These were the two best fighters in the story and yet, most of the back-and-forth was simply a conversation. Tarantino is known for his dialogue and the final moments didn't disappoint in that department but if you're telling a revenge story, it's kind of like going through a video game. Each opponent gets tougher and when you get to the final ""boss fight,"" it typically is and should be the hardest, longest and requiring the utmost of your skills. It seems like, for this arc, he went in the opposite direction.One of the biggest problems I had though, was the fact that I couldn't help feeling that Bill in the end was right. Let's face it, what the bride did to him was pretty messed up and she did it to the very person that she knew wouldn't just let it go. She left pregnant with his baby, changed her identity and married someone else. Did she really think he wouldn't track her down? Did she really think that if he did find out, he would be OK with ending it like it was? She was either really stupid, or very arrogant. Either way, Bill being a ""murdering bastard"" or not, he was completely justified in his actions. It was hard to sympathize with Beatrix in the end.I know that there are a lot of people that hold this movie in high regard but I don't get it.

Critics who should know better. There's an unhealthy air of 'Kill-The-King' Syndrome doing the rounds.Let's not beat about the bush, this film is a MASTERPIECE, and is infinately better than Vol.1. All the kick-and-rush of Vol.1 is replaced here with pacing, depth and texture. This is a homage, not just to Spaghetti Westerns in general, but to the ultimate Spaghetti; Leone's ""Once Upon A Time In The West"". The opening scene with Bill and Beatrix outside the Two Pines Chapel is played out against almost total silence, pretty much like the opening of Leone's marvel. Beatrix then makes a long, slow methodical process of elimination as she wipes out those who surround Bill, almost in identical fashion to Charles Bronson's 'Harmonica' as he edges closer and closer to Henry Fonda's reptilian villain, 'Frank'. The final confrontation between Beatrix and Bill is also similar to the meeting of Harmonica and Frank; it is long and never rushed(there's almost 50 minutes between Beatrix bursting through the door, and the eventual outcome). Just as Harmonica and Frank's confrontation is dealt with in mutual respect, dignity and understanding, so Bill and Beatrix's final meeting is touching and emotional as both still love each other, but must ultimately kill each other. Bill's death is dignified and romantic, a master-stroke from Tarantino.The film is heavilly littered, or should that be bejeweled with references to the great Spaghetti Westerns; the backwards tracking shot out of the Chapel as the Deadly Vipers move in is pure Leone; the mariachi trumpet score from 'A Fistful Of Dollars' and the whistling motif from Sergio Corbucci's 'Il Mercenario'; and the whole chapter of Budd and his reformed 'gun-slinger' taking on a lousy job but being dragged into one last job for a suitcase full of cash, these are all classic Italian Western traits. Just as Vol.1 was his Eastern, so Tarantino now gives us his Western.The acting in this movie is astonishing. David Carradine is an utter revelation, and his lengthy monologues are a joy to listen to. Uma Thurman again delivers, and kudos to Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen for putting in the performances of their career.The 'buried-alive' sequence comes as blessed relief to someone like me who was haunted by the denouement of George Sluizer's 'Spoorloos', and remains surely the most atmospheric and realistic burial scene in movie history.Only two loose-ends bother me; What happened to Sofie Fatale? And if Bill felt Beatrix could never lose her Assasin mantle and live a normal life, how come he allowed Vernita to do just that? She married, had a child and settled into the family-routine.

This film simply reeks of solidity, style, and most of all coolness.  It is OOZING with coolness and badassness!  So many things are explained that once left you hanging in Volume 1.  Black Mamba is fleshed out as one of the greatest cinematic heroines in history, as well as Bill an evil, sadistic villain.  The Showdown between Black Mamba & California Mountain Snake is outlandishly dirty and tough - it's improbable there's a fight scene between two women out there as vicious as this, or as COOL.From the cruel tutelage of Pai Mei, to Budd's disturbing submission techniques, to coming face to face with her daughter, and *gasp* Bill, this movie may very well be my favorite movie of all time.10 / 10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
465,mdenvee,Kill Bill 2: Kill everything about this movie & its prequel.. PLZ,1,3 April 2017,"Yet another example of creative film making which had the potential to be fantastic but ended up miserable. Kill Bill Vol 2 (and Vol 1 for that matter) is an ponderous, pretentious, overlong, disappointing revenge drama which clearly and easily could have been saved via the normal efforts of a decent story or objective movie editor who was NOT Mr. Tarantino or influenced by him. I believe Tarantino, like Lucas, Stone, and many other notables, do their best work when they do not have too much control over the story and pacing. KB has many fine points- an original plot, great casting, music, great camera work. But, fails completely in the script, pacing, and yes the action sequences, which are vital to the creation of a good movie especially of this genre. The scripts were all too 'contrived', boring, irrelevant and unnatural for the characters reciting them- too brooding and overly philosophical, which was as distracting as it was annoying. And Tarantino seems to have this arrogant assumption that we enjoy his pretentious dialogues (and inner monologues) as much as he does. The character development was insufficient- primarily Uma's who is supposed to be such a deadly assassin yet there is little or no back story which validates this. It would have been invaluable to have included some earlier scenes with Uma as the warrior/assassin that she proves ONCE (and only once) in the ridiculous Crazy 88 fight sequence- but that is a sequence which is unconvincing because watching her slice up 88 stupid bodyguards is boring. So, instead of having one of the slowest-paced movies I have ever watched, simply speed things up a little (such as that painfully slow animated O-Ren sequence and in other areas) and add in some assassin background history on Uma. I enjoyed the fight scene of O-Rens personal bodyguard in Vol 1 and the all-too-short training scene in Vol 2 with the Kung Fu master, but that was not really showing Uma as this assassin, nor unbeatable swordmaster. In fact, probably my biggest pet peeve of the both KBs is the odd fact that neither film shows any real sword fighting or special combat scenes among the ""master"" assassins. There is plenty of ""talk"" throughout both films about sword fighting, etc, but ALL the scenes (except that long, repetitive, implausible fight scene with the 88s) involved quick sequences, usually in tight quarters. THINK ABOUT IT- all the people on her list were killed quickly and without any real martial arts!!! O-Ren, Elle, Green, and Bill all were killed by Kiddo (Uma) quickly and with hardly any sword play! Yes, there was a very brief sword fight with O-Ren... but with all the build-up of O- Ren's ability, I would have expected their sword fight to be 3x longer at least and more exciting- instead of spending 30 minutes watching Uma fighting 100s of stupid bodyguard ninjas, and all attacking her one at a time! This made no sense and for me, ruined the movie, since I would have expected all the villains on Uma's list to be killed in true martial arts combat scenes with SWORDS- since they spend both movies talking endlessly about Hattori Hanzo swords! In addition to O- Ren being killed easily with only a few swings of Uma's sword, Green is killed boringly inside her house (despite ""talking"" about scheduling a knife fight), Elle is killed inside a small cramp trailer house without even one swing of either of their Hanzo amazing swords- (yawn, yawn). All the fights were more of a street brawl or cat fight than a kung fu battle. Why not go outside for a real fight?? And Budd was killed by Elle (not even by Uma- again boring!). Bill, the ultimate villain and master, is killed in seconds by Uma with a cool, but all too quick heart explosion trick... after the audience sits through 2 long movies concluding with yet another excruciatingly slow pontificating, pedantic dialogue between them. In both films, there is nothing to support or exhibit how deadly and masterful a fighter Bill is supposed to be!! Geez. All in all, KB2 and KB1 are films which had great potential, but a misguided director and writers/editors who gave the audience ironically zero real kung fu or sword fight scenes among the 'main' characters and thus left us with never really seeing any impressive swordplay or hand to hand kung fu. Instead, we have an overlong, boring, unsatisfying film. A shame.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Although these are very different films, both spoof all previous movies of their type and are loaded with insider allusions (just look at the length of the IMDb trivia sections for each!). Both use latest technology to create a hyper-real quality which goes beyond their forerunners to create a feel that the viewer is seeing something that has not been seen before. But each also stays true to their genres' conventions of character and plot that, though seemingly worn out, we still love.

Anyone who expects it to be is going to be disappointed.After a few minutes of adaptation, however, I slowly fell in love with the second ""Bill"", too. Its mood is totally different, the visual style, the pace. Which is, I am quite certain, exactly as Tarantino wanted it to be. In some ways, it is not quite Tarantino-ish. In others very much so. Like the loving details of each scene. The great camera work. And the master craftsmanship in general.So, how is this one different? It is slower. It is less violent. It gives the characters actual room for development. The music is totally different, too, which can mostly be credited to the fact that this is the first time a QT film has ""custom-made"" music. Somehow it all works. Again.To sum it up: this is another masterpiece by QT. It is perhaps not quite as brilliant as the first half (that is always a risk with sequels), but it is a very close call. It is like the other side of a coin. Completely different, but still alike. If you can, invest the 4h and watch both parts in sequence.

468,regienaldg-283-237153,An excellent conclusion to first volume,10,5 August 2012,"I agree with what most people say about this movie, that it has less actions and more talking. Yes, there were really less actions unlike the first volume and more conversations but then again, those conversations were the heart of the movie. More conversations but there was never a nonsense dialogue in this movie. Everyone who talked in the movie talked with conviction and were sometimes informational (like Elle Driver's information about the black mamba). It is through those conversations that the viewer is able to grasp the meaning of the movie, the implications and essence of the characters' actions, and the characters' behaviors that defined the story. In fact those dialogues were the ones that made this movie quintessential.'The acting was superb. I am particularly impressed by Daryl Hannah's portrayal of the evil and remorseless Elle Driver. Her performance was so excellent I would have handed her the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. The climax was great. It ended well with a resolved conflict.Again Quentin Tarantino showcased another masterpiece. This is a movie that dealt with an individual's resolution of the conflict and consequences of one's actions. Kill Bill Vol. 2 encompassed all movie genres and uncovered individual conflicts and issues that most movies don't.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
469,gluttony14,"Individually, these are two different movies with unique styles. Together, they form a masterpiece",10,29 January 2006,"This movie is quite different from Vol. 1. It isn't as bloody and gruesome (apart from one scene that is so brilliant it would be a sin to spoil it), or as violent, but it has more plot and a lot more dialogue.The dialogue is truly the best part in this movie. You get amazing acting from Uma Thurman, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, Gordon Liu and David Carradine. And even Samuel L. Jackson has a small role, but even then he plays it amazingly. They deliver incredible dialogue written by Tarantino, as only Tarantino knows how to write. It makes you smile, and that's important.What happens in this movie is quite clear - the Bride (whose name is finally revealed in Vol. 2 in a rather awkward little scene) continues her vendetta against Bill and the remaining members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, Budd (Sidewinder) and Elle Driver (California Mountain Snake). She faces peril and excitement. And she fights in incredible fight scenes. We also meet Pai Mei, Bill's master, who also taught the Bride martial arts, and he leaves an impact.Both movies are amazing, but only together they form a true cinematic masterpiece.

The final bit of the film where Beatrix reunites with her estranged daughter at last and settles odds and ends with Bill wasn't exactly bad, I guess, but it was missing some spice. Plus, I was a bit confused during that scene when Beatrix is in pigtails and is sitting in a classroom, whereupon her name gets called by the teacher? To this day, I still don't understand what that scene was about. Other than that, the rest of the movie was pretty solid, definitely less blood than in Volume 1, and I liked how Elle Driver met her end, too. That came around full circle.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

I could not have been more wrong. This movie turned out to be a favorite. The story is wonderful, and the scenes and music go along with it in a near-perfect way. If you like action, they threw in a good deal of that as well. Definitely a must-see movie. I have not seen Vol.1 yet, but I surely intend to, as soon as it comes in at the movie store. I'm not really sure what all to say of it without revealing the plot and story. The star of the show is beautiful.. and deadly, yet an interesting character.

From Sergio Leone to B-movie kung-fu movies bad imitations, Tarantatino tries to show his talent but only proves that he has no originality. This movie has no stylistic unity. At times, the dialogs are a torture ( i.e. the first time The Bride and Bill talks , in the opening chapter ). Usually in that type of movie the fighting scenes can make it at least fun to watch but the fighting sequences in Kill Bill Vol.2 are uninspired and boring. The only good thing in this movie is the soundtrack. At least Jackie Brown had some interesting characters and really good acting ( I prefer Bridget Fonda getting ... by Robert DeNiro than Uma Thurman caught in a wooden box for half an hour)...",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

I also don't think that the way he died at all made sense to the rest of the movie and I found the manner of death and the fact that he died extraneous.Uma Thurman is a bad ass as usual but her best scene was the scene where she rips out Elle's other eye and steps on it.  That scene *RULED* but the fact that you don't know what happens to her ultimately bothers me.  I did like the credits with the cross-out motif.  That was creative.I think that David Carradine, the actor that played Bill, the title character, was boring.  I was expecting someone more interesting to play that character.  Someone more bad ass like Clint Eastwood or something.  I think his death was ironically non-violent and I liked it, it was appropriate.

477,n3vermind,"KB1: ""KB2 you complete me!""",10,1 August 2004,"QT does a fine job once again. I will admit that I don't think that either of these two movies will live as long as Resevoir dogs or Pulp Fiction at all but as a movie addict I was pleasantly surprised with this second installment.I've heard so many times that QT despises the new SFX/CGI trend in Hollywood. If he does feel this way I think it's a pretty weak way of thinking. Sure you can always argue that the CGI takes the focus away from the story, the acting and all the other things we as individuals feel would make a better movie. I disagree, it's just a tool, just like the strings he works with, the fake blood and the stuntment. QT draws the line on what movies can use to convey their message, big man, but kinda stupid considering the business he is in.Getting back to the movie, for quick reference I would like to say that I think KB1 was a very mediocre film where QT decides to take make a ballet of violence combined with mange cartoon to make it more artistic, because if you make violence artistic you can cover up for the fact that you are still going for the shock effect which sells tickets. This second movie shows a lot more depth, better acting, reveals the characters, offers more story buildup and a few twists that were also left out in the first movie. Overall I think QT has probably succeeded in achieving his goal with these two movies. Each of them gives us the moviegoers something different to get excited about, where KB1 definitely gives us violence galore and overtime action, this sequel brings depth to both.I'll give this one 8/10 and say that I'm sorry for thinking after the first one that QT was heading for a disaster. He pulls out fine, but not a masterpiece.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

The first Kill Bill did have more action and gore but I found this one to be it's smarter big brother. The plot is more interesting and finishes the story nicely. The characters are more developed and Bill himself is a very central character,and a fascinating one at that. I also really liked how the characters of Bud and Elle Driver(California mountain snake) where explored a bit more and had more screen time. Plus on top of that all the main performances where really good. My favorite though was Chia Hui Liu as Pai Mei,the extreme Martial arts teacher. My other favorite performance was David Carradine as Bill. Carradine makes Bill a charming,intelligent character as well as a great villain. His super hero speech in this movie is one of its greatest moments. So despite the lack of action I found this to be a smarter,more interesting movie than it's predecessor as well as a wildly entertaining and very original movie",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

I own the dvd and call it my bible. so i was expecting a lot from the second.and i was overwhelmed by the movie. it was incredible. the first one, though amazing, leaves u in a daze from its kinetic pace. The pace of this one is slower, but it allows for more brutality (bride vs elle) more sympathy and more love for the movie.David carradine is amazing in this movie. You know he is a ruthless fuck, but you love him anyways. uma once again delvers an incredible performance. she owns the world of onscreen heriones bc she is strong, yet feminine, brutal, but elegant. Uma tops her performance in kill bill vol. 1, which i thought was impossible.tarantino's direction in this is better as well. Yes there are referneces to his fav styles of movies and whatnot, but it isnt as obvious as in the first one. I love that about the second one. and his script is astounding. i love his words and his superman speech.other good thinngs: godon lui as pai mei (wut a scene), daryl hannah (never thought she was a good actress until now) and the burial scene(wow... creepy as hell).please be smart, oscars, and vote for a truely amazing movie and give props to tarrantino and company for creating 2 movies of incredible power andsubstance.

480,ocarina619,Fantastic Cinema Once Again!,10,22 April 2004,"After watching Volume One, i was convinced that the pending sequel would round Kill Bill off as a fantastic movie.  Where as Volume One focuses on the Eastern style of cinema, Volume Two is much more Western.After the first viewing, I have to say I felt let down simply because of the stupid amount of hype this movie got.  However, I walked out at the end of the credits, walked straight back in and watched it again and thoroughly enjoyed it.Volume Two is different enough from Volume One so that when you watch them collectively, you will get bits of everything in the dosage you require, rather than overdoing one particular style of fight for instance.What struck me most about this second part was the style in which the confrontations were done in.  Where I was expecting massive amounts of sword fighting and blood, following the fight with O-Ren Ishii, I was given two completely different confrontations for Budd and Elle. This was good I felt, because it makes each member of the DIVAS more unique and makes the fights more unique.However it is the final moments of the movie where you have the remaining pieces of the story revealed to you and in Bill's final moments, i found it incredibly touching and my entire outlook on the movie as a whole was turned on its head.While some may argue that Kill Bill isn't as good as Pulp Fiction, it never can be because it is completely different.  Similarly Pulp can never top Kill Bill.  But as far as movies go, Kill Bill is one of the best you'll see.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
481,ed_metal_head,Would Be Better As One Film,8,11 September 2004,"'Kill Bill: Vol. 2' is the second and final part of Quentin Tarantino's tale of revenge. As has been well documented, 'Kill Bill' was supposed to be one film, however studio concerns over a three hour film meant that it was split into two 'volumes'.This film begins where the last one ended. The Bride (Uma Thurman) having already dispatched Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox) and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu) now seeks out the two remaining members of her would be assassination squad - Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) and Budd (Michael Madsen) - along with their leader and her ultimate goal: Bill (David Carradine). As was the case with Vol. 1, Vol. 2 is told in chapters that do not always occur in chronological order. However, Vol. 2 is more linear than the first part was (scenes that are out of order tend to be flashbacks). The pace of this film is, surprisingly, much slower than Vol. 1. Tarantino wisely eschews the gallons of fake blood and focuses on the story and the development of the characters. The result is that the cast get more of a chance to display their acting talents and they duly oblige with some fine performances. With less action, it also means that this film is more verbose than the first part. Unfortunately, the dialogue is not the classic Quentin Tarantino type (with the exception of Bill who has some great lines), it rather serves to further the plot and fill the back-story of the characters.Tarantino's direction in this film is not too different from the first part (as it should be since this is really one film). Some scenes are still shot in black and white, but this time it feels like they were done for style rather than to diminish the on screen violence. Tarantino also manages to create a memorable moment by changing the film's aspect ratio during a claustrophobic scene, giving the viewer a better feel for the situation of the character. Visually, Vol. 2 is quite appealing, but it never reaches the beauty of the first part. This is not the result of the cinematography (which is still excellent), but rather due to the colour palette which is not as broad as in Vol. 1. Thankfully, the fake blood effects of the first part are gone and are replaced with blood that looks more genuine, so that when fight scenes do occur they feel more realistic.Where Vol. 2 really shines is with its acting performances. Uma Thurman gets to show off a broad range of emotions as The Bride and she does so effectively. The way she shows the suffering of her character is truly award-worthy. The actors that play the two assassins she faces in this film (Hannah and Madsen) are definitely a huge improvement from the actors in the last film (Fox and Liu). Of the two, Madsen's performance is the better as he plays Budd with great restraint, which is a surprising trait of his character. Hannah does her job solidly  although she never really has to do anything other than be a badass. David Carradine (better known for the 'Kung-Fu' series) gives the best performance of this movie as Bill. Carradine does not only have a great on screen presence, but he also delivers his dialogue flawlessly throughout. Michael Parks and Gordon Liu, who both acted in the first film, return as different characters in this part. However, both fit into their roles so well that it is virtually impossible to recognise them.The original Kill Bill was supposed to be 180 minutes, however after it was split, Vol. 1 was 111 minutes and Vol. 2 was 136 minutes meaning both films are a total of 247 minutes. The fact that some 67 minutes combined were added to both films accounts for most of the faults of Vol. 2 (and to a lesser extent Vol. 1) since too many scenes feel out of place and like they should have been cut from the final version.Generally, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a fine motion picture. However, if the original film was not split into two it might have been great.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

As a huge Tarantino fan I love all the Tarantino-isms in this movie. It continues the cool story from the first one and brings it to a great end, bringing a lot more emotion into the story. What I loved about Kill Bill in general (this one and the first one) is that it manages to not take itself too serious, but manages to be serious as hell if necessary. Just like every Tarantino it has a really cool soundtrack. You have to see the first one to really enjoy this one, but watching them back to back is no problem at all and makes them the perfect movie-night evening filler.

He reveals all exposition and backstory vitally missing from the first installment. And he does it with sheer class. Utterly beautiful shots, perfect performances and his trademark humour blacker than Elle Driver's eye patch. But this is a true case of substance finally killing style, unlike Vol. 1. The emotional journey that the Bride goes through is stunning. And both Thurman and Carradine deliver iconic performances filled with weight and depth.

Also there was lots of funny stuff in it, f.e. the dialogue in the beginning between Michael Madsen and Larry Bishop, the Pai Mai priest ...

The loose ends and questions from Vol.1 are seamlessly threaded into the next passage of Beatrix's vengeful odyssey and flow perfectly through to a wonderfully crafted and satisfying denouement.

Yes! The fight of Elle and the bride is one of a kind. Beautifully shot, beautifully cut, tough, vicious and violent. The included Flashbacks throughout the film give lots more information on the who, what and why and come the final act, you can't help but care about all the characters. As a whole, Kill Bill offers the essence of all those trash-films, we just love to watch and Tarantino successfully shows his affection in this ultimate homage-movie.

Opening day, I was there. I might have had my hopes up too much. Volume 1 centered completely around the women. The guys are on the back burner 'til Vol. 2. That's probably why I reacted more favorably to Vol. 1. Vol. 2  is still a finely crafted film. I'm guessing that men liked Vol. 2 better since men are more prominent. Vol. 2 is a better film emotionally. The violence is less cartoonish. The fight between ""The Bride"" and ole one-eyed Daryl Hannah is quite realistic. (I kept thinking of Blade Runner during that scene). Well, as realistic as it can be. Who can really get thrown into walls time after time and continue fighting. Tarantino owes as much to spaghetti westerns as he does to martial arts films (which I've never been that fond of). Aren't nearly all of the man-with-no-name Eastwood films similar in theme? A wronged man gets his revenge. In this case, the Bride gets her revenge. I will definitely see these two volumes again on DVD.

491,nekanderson881,Starring Tarantino and Thurman,8,17 April 2004,"*** Warning! Contains Spoilers ***The second half of Tarantino's long-awaited martial arts revenge flick stars Uma Thurman as The Bride and David Carradine, as Bill.  Looking so much like his late father John, Carradine has his first starring role in a major motion picture in years.   Vol. 2 has more dialogue than its predecessor and gives much-needed background information on the characters.  The best action sequence is between Thurman and Hannah in the trailer house of the recently deceased Madsen.  He has died from the bite of a venomous snake which just happened to be inside a suitcase containing a million dollars in cash which Hannah brought with her to pay for a special sword of his.  After he is bitten, she reads (to comic effect) from a small spiral notebook information accessed from the Internet on this snake and its deadly venom.  One-eyed Hannah loses the other eye in this fight when Thurman pokes it out and subsequently drops it to the floor squishing it between her toes.  The second best action sequence has Thurman shot and then buried alive.  In this sequence there is a flashback of her extensive martial arts training by a master with a long white beard which he constantly runs his hand through. Thurman successfully breaks the wooden coffin she is buried in and surfaces to breathe among us once again.  This woman is unstoppable.  The music by 1960s spaghetti western composer Ennio Morricone is used in the film with great effect.  Classic pop songs have been used brilliantly in Tarantino's other films and here we have the wonderful hit  ""About Her"".  The ultimate demise of Bill comes from The Bride's use of the five finger heart stopping technique taught to her by the master.  Sure enough, after five steps Bill keels over and dies. Compared to Tarantino's best film to date ""Pulp Fiction"", this film lacks its originality and ultra-hip dialogue.  ""Jackie Brown"" recreated the feel of the blackploxation films of the 1970s and here we have the same decade's Kung Fu and spaghetti westerns revived.  This film is a must for Tarantino's fans.  He is as much the star of the film as anyone.

493,CadeFilms,A Better Structured And Less Annoying Addition To The First,9,18 April 2021,"Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill: Vol. 2 suffers from the same issues as the first so read my Kill Bill: Vol. 1 review if you want a more generalized summary of its problems. However, this one is definitely the preferable of the two, since it is more mature in its presentation and pacing. It is never boring and always has something happening while still being able to contain a slow pace that adds to its world-building and personality. There's still a lack of suspense; however, since Beatrix states to the audience at the very beginning of the film that she has already killed all four members of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad. This is absolutely detrimental to the movie due to the audience knowing during the film's most important sequences that she is going to get out of them unharmed. Examples of this are when she's buried alive, fighting Elle, etc. I'm so ready to move on to the films of Tarantino's later career since I know that he finally became aware of suspense's existence. Anyways, besides the needless inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson's character and a hilarious truth serum that makes no sense, Kill Bill: Vol. 2 surpasses the first in almost every way since its lack of suspense only affects the first acts. Kill Bill: Vol. 1's unfortunately affects the entire climax. Also, I am aware the Tarantino is utilizing the truth serum as a parody of the genre; however, that doesn't mean that it is any less stupid.88% or 8.8/10.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Character development and a better driven plot.The Bride has taken care of the her first two ex-partners. Now is up to her to finish off the remaining members before she can get to Bill. Throughout this journey, she has to learn the new ways of the Chinese Martial Arts, escaping from being buried alive, destroying a trailer and most obviously, tracking down her man responsible for the death of her loved one. Also, her unborn daughter.The action, the style and the content sticks to it pretty much similar to the first picture. A high praise still. Tarantino added in more characterization in to the characters. Especially The Bride and Bill himself. The late David Carradine, did an amazing job at being that character. We did not see much of how capable he was in the previous release. In this chapter, audience will get a taste out of David for his calmed and twisted martial arts expert Bill.

Vol. 2 still has enough action to satisfy a normal person, but what makes Vol. 2 so fun to watch is not what made Vol. 1 just as fun last year.  It's fun to see in Vol. 2 how all of the different story points fit together so well with the facts from Vol. 1, even the little ones, like Elle Driver's eye.  This goes to show you how talented Quentin Tarantino is as a writer and director.  If you haven't seen either movie, it would be smart to rent Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 together and watch them together, instead of a year apart like everyone else did.  This way, if you watched them together, you'd probably miss fewer of the plot points and you'd get the most out of the story.  If you really like the films, you may even consider watching them more than once, until you understand everything.  Excellent acting from Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, and, as always, Uma Thurman.  David Carradine, who I've never considered a good actor, gives his best performance in Kill Bill Vol. 2.  Good acting from the rest of the cast.  Good story and good directing, but not Tarantino's best.  Nine stars out of ten.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
497,led_zeppelin_zoso,"A triumph, Tarentino at the top of his form",8,4 March 2005,"Many people say the first volume is better but I would say that I disagree. One reason I love Tarentino's work is because he is a master a creating the dialog for his characters in an unforgettable way. One scene where i really enjoyed the dialog was when David Caradine was talking about how Clark Kents disguise is Superman but it is Actually Kent because he grew up as superman and had to find a disguise.This film continues the revenge of Uma's character ""The Bride"". The great way of ending the first volume was having Bill tell Ellle Driver that Uma's child was still alive, that made me even more intrigued for volume two. This one looks more at Uma's past with Bill(little spoiler) and her training with Pai Mai(Same actor played the role of Gorden Liu)and her struggles to find and Kill Bill. With all the high stylized action and crude language this movie contains you just know it is a Tarentino film, he excites you with his odd violence in the first volume but then captures you in the second with the unforgettable dialog and flashback that will resolve your many wonders. The acting is sensational and Caradine should have got an Oscar nomination for his role of Bill, Uma Thurman was good but not Oscar worthy, she ended up being nominated for a golden globe award. Just like how ""Pulp Fiction"" won the Oscar for ""Best original screenplay"" I thought this also should have.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

499,marinos theodore,Well worth the wait,10,5 May 2004,"Kill Bill Volume 1 was my favorite 2003 film. It was one of the rare times i was laughing in a cinema not because the movie was funny (intentionally or unintentionally) but because i was enjoying mt self. It was the most fun time i' ve had in a cinema for a long-long time! After a six month wait period, the film's conclusion finally arrived. Did it leave up to my expectations? Yes it did, although in a totally different way.Let's get on thing straight right from the start: Kill Bill Vol. 2 is entirely different to Vol. 1. It's almost like watching a completely different film.First of all the action takes several steps back and character development steps forth. The Bride (whose real name is revealed but i won't spoil it for you) is almost an entirely different person this time around. She no longer is an unlikable super-bitch. She shows an incredible range of emotions from fear to sympathy and love and this time we really do CARE for her and her cause. Bill also gets some serious development. We learn about his relationship with the Bride and why he decided to kill her, and in the end we do feel some sympathy for him too. There also is a lot of Tarantino-esque dialog in this installment. Bill's take on Superman was one of the smartest things i've heard in a movie this year!The action and humor  although toned down, still play an important part in the movie. Volume 2 is more brutal than Volume 1, and even though it doesn't contain any scenes like the Crazy 88 massacre (who as we find out weren't really 88 LOL) it's very violent and graphic (no blood (gaizers this time). The duel with Elle is truly a thing to behold! But by far the best part of the movie is the chapter entitled ""The Cruel Tutelage Of Pei Mei"" where we witness the Bride's training by a realy old Kung-Fu master. Their duels and Pei Mei's lines are the movie's highlights!Direction wise Tarantino works his magic once again. This time the film is more Spagheti-Western oriented and it almost entirelly takes place in a desert (in El Passo none the less...) and the soundtrack is full of songs by Robert Rodriguez and Ennio Moriconne. The usual Kung-Fu tricks (sudden close ups etc) still make their appearance as well as some really cool camera angles and tricks (the end of the opening sequence is a real tour de force for Quentin Tarantino). Kudos have to be given to Tarantino for creating the best and more nightmarish sequence of someone being buried alive, you'll be surprised by how uncomfortable he'll make you feel just by watching a black screen and hearing strange sounds. Credit is also due to Uma Thurman who did one hell of a nice job as the Bride (heck she deserves an Oscar for the last sequence of the film alone) and to David Carandine who was deliciously evil and enjoyable in the role of the eponymous villain.I only have two gripes about the movie. Sometimes the story dragged on and there were some scenes that just took up time and stalled the story. The sequence where we see Budd working at the titi bar for example was very very long and it served absolutely no purpose. My other gripe is that the Bride's duel with Bill is really short, and out of balance compared to the huge amount of dialog between the two characters that preceeds it.If Vol. 1 was all style and no substance, then Vol. 2 is all style and all substance. It's a different experience in many levels but it's still a very enjoyable one. If the reason you saw Volume 1 was because you liked the slick action scenes featured in the trailers, don't even bother watching Volume 2, you will be very disappointed. I rate this movie with a perfect 10. Simply put, alongside Big Fish (which debuted here in 2004), it's the best film i've seen this far in 2004.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
500,shazrahman,Please let me be cool!,1,14 September 2008,"Tarantino was the kid at school nobody liked and he desperately wanted to be cool. His movies reek of this desperation.Some parts are cool and some parts are very contrived, this movie was mainly contrived. I thought the visual effects were decent but they lacked credibility. Its hard to believe a skinny Uma Thurman is going to chop up all those people with one sword. Or that she can defy the laws of physics and escape being buried alive.The acting was nonchalant, nobody seemed to care that much - but I understood that that was the point. But then I didn't really like anybody, they were all so two dimensional who cared if they died? Nice try Tarantino - haven't seen a movie out of you for a while. Hope your sabbatical is indefinite.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
501,johnnyfive,vol.2 the western,7,25 April 2004,"Okay I admit that I loved vol.1, and that I was disappointed with vol.2 but you have to appreciate that as a separate film it is different than the first thus feeling less of a rip off (Take the ""Boogeyman"" sequel for instance). The first was an eastern action-adventure and the second - an all out spaghetti western.     Sure I would love to see a complete one volume version where all the action is more evenly paced (maybe the dvd version). I would recommend this but I would also warn that it is not as fast paced as the first. On a lighter note there is some really funny bits (especially with Pei Mei) and the fight scenes (as short as they are) are still quite watchable complete with a suitable ending. There are still some questions unanswered, but hey that might be resolved in vol. 3?",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
502,Kingveggeta87,Bill steals the show,10,13 May 2004,"After I saw Kill Bill Vol.1 the Friday Part 2 came out in theaters, I was itching for a chance to see how it all ends.  I finally got a chance to check it out a couple of weeks later and I was blown away.  We don't get jumbled up and unanswered questions like we did with The Matrix Revolutions (Andy and Larry, please take note!!!).  Instead, we get a perfectly wrapped present that ties everything down nicely.But we all know that this film would not be as great if it didn't have David Carradine, who finally shows his face as Bill.  His cool exterior and excellent humurous lines drive the whole second half of the film.  I was about to cry when he dies in the end, yes he was that great.To make a long story short.

504,MicktheGreat,"Not as good as the first, but still a great movie...",8,16 April 2004,"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***I had my reservations before seeing Kill Bill Vol. 1 last year due to the amount of gore, killing, etc. However, after I saw it, I appreciated Kill Bill for its precise wit, unique storyline, vivid cinematography, and incredible music. And I thought that the violence was tolerable because it was done in such an over-the-top, fantastical way.Kill Bill Vol. 2 is an entirely different movie. Gone are the one vs. an army battle scenes (the Bride vs. the Crazy 88's) from the first movie and there is little to no gore in this movie (except for at the end of the Bride vs. Elle Driver fight...I'll leave what exactly happens as a surprise if you don't already know...). The musical score and choice of songs are not nearly as impressive as in the first movie. Even the cinematography is not as crisp and uber-cool as the first Kill Bill.However, that does not mean that Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a bad movie--only different from Kill Bill Vol. 1. The storyline in Vol. 2 is much more methodical and the characters are given more depth this time around. And the movie is still full of crisp dialogue and humor (Pei Mei's training of the Bride is one of the funniest scenes from recent memory). Vol. 2 with its slow pace and depth is ultimately a deeper movie than Vol. 1 with its nearly nonstop action and comical gore.Chia Hui Lui (Pei Mei) is absolutely hilarious. Daryl Hannah does very well as the sadistically cruel Elle Driver. And Michael Madsen (a Tarantino mainstay) provides a solid performance as the hick/slob of a killer named Budd. David Carradine is great as Bill. The way Carradine portrays Bill with a calm yet unpredictable demeanor gives the impression that he could go off at any minute. Plus, we get a brief Samuel L. Jackson cameo as Rufus, the organ player.However, Uma Thurman's performance is the best of the movie. She brings an undeniable charisma to the Bride and does just as well as she did in Vol. 1 if not better. I think she deserves a nomination for Best Actress and would be surprised if she wasn't at least considered for a nomination.In the end, it's very hard to compare Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 as they are very different. In my humble opinion, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is not as good as the original but is still a great movie worth watching.8 out of 10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

506,flamingobill,QT delivers a masterpiece with both films combined,10,10 April 2004,"The first one was an adrenaline rush of a good time, while the second one pushes the end product to be a masterpiece. It's up there with Akira Kurosawa's ""The Seven Samurai"". The first film played out like a video game with great visuals, music, and a thin story without characterization or QT's sharp dialogue (and managed to be great because of all this, because it was, plain and simple, a bloody good, shocking time), while the second one can stand on it's own as a full movie. It has what the first one lacked, yet without the first one the mythology about the Bride, and just how brutally, and horrifyingly violent she can get, is absent. Together, as a whole, the movie delivers on every note any cinemaphile could want in a movie.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
507,Jurgen E Haug,Should never have been separated from part one,9,28 April 2005,"After seeing the fantastic first part of Kill Bill, I was counting the days until I could go and see the sequel. Finally I was able to go, and then this. I was somewhat disappointed. It wasn't really outright bad, it wasn't really outright boring, but it was the perfect anti-climax to Vol. 1. Mr. Tarantino should never have cut that into two parts! If it would have been one long film, I think I wouldn't see the second part as I do now. After the first two hours of what is now Vol. 1 with its thrill, the violence, the speed of it, continuing a bit slowing (okay, forget the 'bit'), continuing slower paced, leading to the end, that would have been okay. But since the first part is now some months old, and with the expectations I had for Vol. 2, I felt a bit like the guy jumping out of the birthday cake ""BOOO"" and realising he was two hours early and no one is there.The one good scene it it was that piece where The Bride got buried alive, until she walked into that café asking for water. And I like the piece where she tore out the last remaining eye from Elle. What I also liked (first I thought what the hell) was Bill's speech about super heroes and superman and what's the difference between Superman and the others. And what all that had to do with The Bride. That was a nice parable, and I could understand Bill on that point.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
508,Fidelios_Film_Central,Tarantino's Homage to the Leone Western Misses a Few Beats,6,14 April 2004,"There's probably not a bigger Quentin Tarantino fan than myself.  In high school, all I could talk about was Pulp Fiction.  We used to analyze that film and quote the dialogue during class.  When Jackie Brown came out, some were disappointed, but not me.  I saw the clever dialogue, the play with structure and storytelling as it was.  Tarantino made the film he wanted to make.Then when I saw Kill Bill: Volume 1 back in September of last year, three weeks before it opened at an advanced screening that I trekked all the way out of Secaucus, NJ to see, I was in awe for the entire film.  With Tarantino's highly stylized homage to Japanese Kung-fu films and Japanimation, Robert Richardson's amazing crisp cinematography, Sally Menke's skillful editing, and RZA's catchy score, Kill Bill: Volume 1 went on to be nominated for 11 Fidelio Film Awards, winning 6.
Were expectations quite high for Kill Bill: Volume 2?  Of course they were. Were expectations high for Volume 1?  Probably even more so and they were met.  Unfortunately, Volume 2 misses a few beats in Tarantino's homage to the Sergio Leone western as he tries to merge both the western with Chinese martial arts films.Volume 2 almost feels like The Matrix Revolutions compared to the first two. Volume 2 is different in tone, and lacks the style and action scenes of the first one.  And while the story is still interesting, I'm not quite sure the structure works as well as in the first one.**SPOILERS BELOW**Bill's fight scene with Michael Jai White as Alburt (Da Moe) was deleted. This is a scene which apparently would have shown Bill's kung-fu talent, and was needed.  As it stands now, Bill is just a legend.  We see him, but we don't see the tyrant that everyone describes.  We only know him through what he did to the Bride.  We needed to see him in action, to see how deadly he was and why he was so dreaded.  We got to see O-Ren in action, as well as Vernita Green and Elle Driver.  The only other one we didn't is Budd, but the point is he's a burnt out swordsman, who quit the business.  Bill is supposed to be as deadly as ever.The whole film was like an anti-climax.  It worked in Pulp Fiction, in the diner scene at the end because it fit the style of the movie.  In Volume 1, it all led up to the House of Blue Leaves Showdown.  That was the climax. Here, we really don't get one, and this should be the ultimate one. Instead, Tarantino goes for a gimmick at the end.  And it was a predictable one at that.The main problem with Volume 2 is that there is no consistent style or tone. Tarantino was trying to blend the Sergio Leone western with the Chinese martial arts fighting and because of this, there is no consistent style, like there was in Volume 1.He makes fun of the old Jackie Chan like Chinese martial arts films throughout the Pei Mei scene, with the hazy old look and Pei Mei constantly stroking his beard.  And he pays homage to the Sergio Leone spaghetti western, specifically Once Upon a Time in the West. Bill plays a flute just as Harmonica (Charles Bronson), well, plays a harmonica in West, but it doesn't work as well as it did in West.  When we first meet Bill at the chapel, it's used to build tension in the scene and the problem is The Bride knows it's him, but we don't yet.  And this is another instance where structure doesn't work.The thing that does work here, as the homage to the Leone western, is the maliciousness of Elle Driver, and her standoff with The Bride; in the standoff, Tarantino is able to build tension that Leone did so well.Another thing that takes you out of the film is the scenes with the daughter that are overly sentimental, almost bordering on Kevin Smith Jersey Girl territory.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Tarantino's become a sell-out hack like Smith, it's just that something is off here, what he was trying to accomplish just doesn't work all the time.There are still some good things though.  The Bride vs. Elle scene is great, especially the ending of that scene.  Some of the stuff with Pei Mei works, but then I thought it could have been more humorous.  There is another homage to Brian De Palma, specifically two scenes to Carrie:  Carrie's hand coming out of the grave at the end, and the close up of the blood-ridden Carrie.  I won't give away how they are used in the film, but they are there.While Volume 2 isn't a terrible film by any means, this isn't the film that should have followed up the energy, style and charisma of Volume 1.  The clever Tarantino dialogue is supposed to hold this film together, and unfortunately, it falls short here.  Whether it's Bill making a Superman analogy to The Bride, or Budd getting reamed by his boss at the bar, it feels as though Tarantino rushed through writing the scenes; they are not as vibrant as in his previous scripts, or even in Volume 1.
Tarantino has already said he's thinking about doing a Volume 3 where Nikki, Vernita Green's daughter, comes after The Bride for revenge.  He said he wants to make it in 15 years, but start filming part of it now while the actors are at this age.  Let's just hope he spends these 15 years making it as good as the first one.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

510,colinesq-859-519335,Michael Parks,1,7 January 2016,"I can't believe that Michael Parks played a fake Hispanic person for this movie. What's next Quentin? Blackface? It's 2016 and Quentin Tarantino hasn't made a single watchable film since Jackie Brown. I get it, he wants to work on mini-series type projects like the ones that are thriving right now. But Hollywood needs Quentin to sell movie tickets. Even though he never even went to film school he can make a movie that can earn the studio millions of dollars. Even Disney tried to edge him out of the competition so that they could make more money over Christmas with Star Wars. People will always try to tell you how great Kill Bill is as a movie. I think it has some cool parts but as a movie it is sort of lame and drawn out. I enjoy the Bruce Lee subtext element of Kill Bill, but then you've gone and got Michael Parks playing a fake latino.

I am not a great fan of Tarantino films. They are typically overdone caricatures of a theme and very shallow.This was either a relief to see, or Quinten's head was a little clearer when he did this one. The supporting cast definitely adds to the story, and there are comedic moments of irony sorely lacking in the first.Beyond this however, the violence and profanity is still grossly mindless- I am not at all opposed to either, however it must be justified with context.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

And just like that a new movie is just released.Pulp Fiction. Not a bad movie because of all the good actors in it. Other than that not that great of a movie. It's hard to mess up a movie about a drug dealer, an overdose, and multiple characters that are all very action-packed. See Pulp Fiction if you want. It's not something you need to own.

513,ebhae-34976,The better half but the whole bloody affair is better.,9,19 February 2017,"This review will be split into two parts, one were i talk about this movie and one were I talk about the new version of this movie and part one called Kill Bill the whole bloody affair.Kill Bill vol 2:This was a so genius move by Tarantino. After having done one of the goriest and most violent movies of all time, going back to the brides back story and give the character more depth. This movie have arguably one of Tarantinos better scripts and i would say it could have been executed better. The way that they tell the brides back story is so genius, I will not spoiled to much but it's a scene were she need to have a specific skills and then they going back to show her training. Many people is disturbed by the fact that the finally is more talk the talk then walk the walk but I ain't because it's make this movie so much more emotional and the story comes full circle. If you want me to mention something that could have been better executed I say Esteban that is bad overacting and an Mexican accent that doesn't work.Without the whole bloody affair this is my 5th favorite movie by Tarantino, my favorite director. Kill Bill The whole bloody affair:This is Kill Bill volume 1+2 in one movie with some improvements. For you who can't find this movie or don't want to buy it, I recommend (( fmovies.com (were you don't even have to download it or signing in)). And for you who haven't seen Kill Bill vol 2 at all I recommend you to see the whole bloody affair first because it's one scene in this movie that will change your way to look at Bill to the better, maybe forever. The Kill Bill vol 2 part is not so different but the Kill bill volume one is and I would still say the Kill Bill vol 2 part is slightly better. Kill Bill the whole bloody affair is insanely highly rated but get's way to less votes to arrive to the IMDb top 250 list.

516,Greggory,Is everyone a lemming?! This film is pretty dreadful!,4,1 February 2005,"I saw Vol. 1 the other night and was absolutely dazzled! It's not because I like action -- in fact, I rather don't -- it's that Vol. 1 is masterful, creative film-making, with almost impossible attention to detail (both visual and aural) and an anfractuous script that is perfectly crafted. I just saw Vol. 2, however, and I came on this site to see what people had to say...and I'm SHOCKED by you all! I can only guess that people responded to seeing character development in Vol. 2 --as ridiculous as it is (tell me, where oh where is there ANY real depth, ANY earned feeling?) -- that was withheld (intentionally, as it was unnecessary to what Vol. 1 is) in its predecessor. What is that at the end: ""All is right in the jungle / The cub is with her mother"" or something like that...Are you kidding me?! Are you people sheep?! Did this touch your heart or something? I'd think that Q's had a big joke on anyone if it weren't that it would be much too much trouble to go through. The whole training thing was nothing more than a redux of that kind of thing in martial-arts movies -- not an homage, not something new, just a redux. In fact, this is the whole movie: redux. Truth serum?! A hidden snake?! All that exposition?! And as far as the action, why bother, if you're gonna step down so far from Vol. 1?! QT ran out of steam. I know he wasn't TRYING to make Vol. 2 like Vol. 1...but he should have. Or maybe not. It seems the masses -- after all, the same people who somehow call themselves film fans while watching the Oscars year after year even though they give Kevin Costener Best Director for ""Dances With Wolves"" over Martin Scorsese for ""Goodfellas"" -- can't tell the difference.

Found Part 1 mildly entertaining and expected Part 2 to enhance overall experience.  No such luck.  Part 1 was way over the top (a times to the point of ridiculousness) and Part 2 was excruciatingly dull with too much boring dialogue. Continuity suffered through the over use of flashbacks, animation and black and white. The 2 parts could easily have been released as a single, shortened and much better edited film and accordingly felt ripped off.

I read a number of pre-release blubs saying Vol II would have a western theme, great I like old westerns. If mister Tarentino is a master film maker he used all that skill on Vol 1 and had nothing left for Vol II this ""in my opinion"" is the worst movie I have seen in the last ten years. Some other reviews here have said the distributors wanted to split Kill bill into two 1.5 hour movies, this sounds good but KB2 had at most 30 minutes of useful footage the rest was longwinded dialogue sessions that in most cases added little to plot or character development and should have been left on the cutting room floor. It should have been left as one 2 hour movie",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
519,gunflyer,"Overrated Tripe, volume 2",4,28 December 2012,"I find volume 2 to be the better of the two Kill Bill films... but that's mostly because compared to the first, this one is much lighter on the ridiculous amounts of blood and gore, and a little higher on the drama. The problem is... in doing so, the movie becomes boring and ends up looking as though it needs more editing. I mean seriously, part of the Film is about Budd going to work and getting fired or something and for some reason, Tarantino really thought we needed to see this whole damn sequence which doesn't establish a set up or anything or serve any purpose later in the film. Other parts of the film linger for far too long on many different shots too in my opinion. I don't know what Tarantino was thinking, maybe he thinks he's Stanley Kubrick or something? No, Tarantino is no Kubrick. Not by many thousands of light years.Instead, the Bride almost gets killed by Budd when in the previous film she killed many, many experts with the deadly arts, when she gets buried alive by a dumb ass hick. But that's the least of the problems with the film. My biggest problem is this: It's been established by this film that Bill is in love with Beatrix(The Bride), who is in hiding from assassins because she's pregnant. Obviously, Bill loves her. Want to know HOW much he loves her? He loves her SO much that he tracks her down, murders everyone in a church, shoots Beatrix in the head, takes her baby, puts her in a coma then into a hospital she is repeatedly RAPED while in that coma. Welcome to a world where nothing makes sense people.My point is... this movie, and the one that preceded it are based on a premise that is so incredibly, inexplicably dumb that I can't possibly wrap my mind around it. Bill loves her so much... that he almost kills her, AND takes her baby. You know what? I almost forgot that definition in the dictionary that defines love as almost murdering the one you love. Now, I understand if Bill is really emotional. I understand if he's really sad, or really angry. But I don't understand the mentality of somebody who loves somebody so much that when you find her again someday... you shoot her in the god damn head!!! That makes absolutely no sense to me, no matter how much I try to rationalize or explain it to myself. Frankly the premise causes the whole film and the last to crumble apart into dust for me. Kill Bill volume 1 sucked... and this one sucks too.On the plus side... some of the music is REALLY great and some of the ideas are fun and original, like Beatrix digging her way out of the grave. But otherwise, I would never recommend this series to anyone.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
520,justinreynolds40,Somebody merge Kill Bill 1 & 2 into one and re-edit the order of scenes!,6,18 December 2015,"The HUGE HUGE HUGE weakness of this film is the fact that it is so slow. If you have just watched Kill Bill Part 1 and expect blood and guts galore and lots of scenes showing Beatrix kick ass and sever heads and limbs then you'll be very disappointed. You need patience and to be in the right frame of mind to get the most from this movie. This film is definitely more like a western rather than a kung fu movie (besides the scenes with Pai Mei).If you do have patience though you'll be rewarded. Many things that weren't explained in the first half are explained. It ties things up. People may often pigeonhole Tarantino as an action director, but here he really shines in the intriguing dialogue that he has the actors deliver.The final encounter with Bill disappointed me and left me craving for more. It felt like something was missing and there were a lot of scenes cut from Beatrix's encounter with Bill. I feel this scene should have had a more epic fight scene, though the verbal exchanges were pretty intense. Bill shouldn't have been so easy to kill dammit! Overall this is definitely not a bad film, but it's incredibly imbalanced. Some scenes from this film should have been in the first half and some action scenes from the first half should have been in the second. I don't like the whole action first (part 1) and dialogue later (part 2)that Tarantino took.I definitely agree that someone should merge Kill Bill 1 & 2 into one and re-edit the order of the scenes.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
521,xjuggernaughtx,"Well, it's better than Kill Bill, Vol. 1...",5,7 September 2005,"But it still doesn't reach it's lofty potential.Now let's get one thing straight. This is a much, much better film than Kill Bill, Vol. 1. There is interesting character development and some twists and turns, plot-wise. Everything with Michael Madsen is great. Thurman's training flashback is well done.However, it still doesn't overcome the fact that Tarantino didn't make me care about Kiddo in the first film and, by the end, I still don't care. The confrontation with Bill is absolutely the worst part of this film, especially with as much dialogue as they have. Dialogue has always been Tarantino's hallmark and it just generally falls flat here. It's not actively bad, just pedestrian. The superhero analogy is the one shining moment at the end of the film.The film throws a plot curveball about two-thirds of the way through, but, strangely enough, it's not really a curve ball at all. The plot would have been resolved with or without it, so it really doesn't make any difference and eats up a lot of screen time.Now I'm of the camp that if Tarantino had just edited these films together, this probably would have been a much better movie. There are good parts of both, but I feel that as two separate entities, they largely fail. Together, they could have shored up each others weaknesses. The first Kill Bill is largely plot less, with bad action and bad dialogue. The second is often times boring. Together they could have been an average movie, instead of two bad ones.Once again, I would suggest seeing this, just because it is in our culture and it helps in social discussion to be able to talk about it, but don't expect a masterpiece. It's light on originality and heavy on cliché. Not quite as dependent as the first film, but there is not much inspired here in the script. A visual and technical feast, but a midnight snack as a creative film.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

He didn't know that years after his death some video store clerk turned director would completely rip-off the sty lings of his ever so popular movies. Well he might not be able to protest, but I sure can. ""Volume 2"" is one of the biggest rip-off's I have ever seen(closely followed by ""Volume 1""). I used to respect Tarantino until I saw the movies that inspired him. After watching this film again, I think that someone should call the studio and file a copyright suite! ""Volume 2"" was full of corny dialog and ridiculous action. It's almost like Quentin was trying too hard. I would recommend this movie to a thirteen year old boy who doesn't have the patience to sit through any Kurosawa or Leone films because they are too ""long"" or don't have enough ""action"" or not enough ""cool one-liners"".",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

To what end?In this film I was on the edge of my seat... hoping someone on the big screen would say even one line remotely interesting. Nope. Not even the acting was interesting. Just some bits and pieces of many movies that have come before.But isn't that what Tarantino does best? Its hip hop. Its editing. Its sampling. Clever use of other people's ideas is by no means art. But it is so cool, isn't it?Candy will not sustain one's hunger. It only gives you a quick fix. QT does have talent but someone has to shake him and tell him that at some point he needs to take the craft of film making more seriously. It is as if he is too scared to actually try and say something - to try something original.How long did it take Spielberg to finally let go of all the tried and true conventions of his craft and try something serious (Schindler's List), not letting 'box office opening weekend grosses' mentality be the bottom line?My respect for both QT and UT have dropped but what do they care?

Still i went to the theater to watch the second volume and... a big heavy deception. I though i was in a nightmare.

527,Luke902,Kill Bill Review: Vol.2,10,7 April 2006,"Tarantino has done it again. Vol.2 answers all of Vol.1's questions and then some. But you must be warned: If you are hoping to see a spectacular action film like Vol.1, then just don't watch this.So, here it goes.In the end of the first film, we learn that The Bride's daughter is alive. But she doesn't know this... Which raises another question: How will this effect/distract her when it comes time to ""Kill Bill""?This is the film I prefer of the 2. It is because, well, it is brilliant. This film answers questions that were never even asked. Tarantino just let his imagination go to work and we got this. I didn't see it coming. I thought I was in for an exhilarating action experience, and I got an engrossing finish to what was before a some what zany story. It all comes full circle. And it does so flawlessly.In this one, her first target is Budd. In one of the best parts of the film, which is ""Chapter 7: The Lonely Grave of Paula Shultz"" Budd goes to work, and he is a bouncer. He is late (as always, we learn) and is called back to his cocaine-fueled boss's office. He is fired and told by his boss to not where his hat to work. And that's the beauty of it. We see that underneath this character, a murderer though he once was, he is human. He once got paid a lot to kill people, and now is bossed around by some jerk getting paid bum cash and living in a trailer.So, he goes home, sits in his camper and puts a Johnny Cash record on. The Bride creeps from underneath his trailer and swings the door open, but instead of a getting quick kill, she gets shot. This is a point of confusion for all viewers. She survives because she was shot in the chest, and her breasts acted as a shield, absorbing the rock salt from the shotgun shells.We learn how the Bride got so good at killing. She is trained by quite possibly the most dangerous man alive, Pai Mei. We watch her harsh training.Finally, she reaches Bill and, in another touching moment, sees her daughter for the first time.This was one of Tarantino's most daring moves. The Bride and Bill don't have their showdown for a great deal of time after she arrives at his home. But it gets there. And when it does, it is one of the best scenes ever in film history, not for the violence (because there hardly is any), but because of the emotion. Bill is dying, they say their final words to each over, and he dies. But the Bride is not triumphantly howling now that she's done. She is sad. She is sad because she once loved Bill. The film manages to stay realistic in the human aspects of its characters. Though he had done wrong to her, she had forgiven him. And it's because she's done that that she is able to grieve for him, not as the man who shot her, but as the man who was once very near and dear to her. And when you think about it, it is very touching.Vol.2 is pure genius.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

531,Emre-kyncu68,Kill Bill Vol 2 Review,7,4 November 2020,"Kill Bill Vol 2 Review
I was fascinated by Quentin Tarantino's First Kill Bill movie with Uma Thurman. As Tarantino did in every film, he put something of himself into the film and put forward another masterpiece. It gave the audience a solid action combined with a beautiful script. Excessive blood and slang were the main elements I liked in the film. I was very satisfied with the duel scene in the moonlight at the end of the film. Because of that, it could be among my 50 favorite movies, which is a pretty good place, judging by the number of movies I've watched. 2 in the first film. I had a lot of question marks left in my head for the movie. What was bride's name? Why wasn't it said? I wonder if Bride would get her revenge on Bill in the second movie..... I watched the first movie about 3 or 4 months from now, and I thought I was even late 2. I started filming. Judging by the overall audience, the second film score was 0.1 degrees lower than the first film score. But my expectation was that it would be better than the first movie. I was overloaded. But I realized that this excitement was unnecessary. If you watch a movie without expectations, you will be happy that it will come out well, but you will be upset if it does not meet your expectations. In short, Kill Bill Vol 2, which I started watching with high expectations, fell short of my expectations. Don't misunderstand. I'm not saying it was a bad movie. It just fell short of my expectations. I'd like it if I watched it without expectations.Now that we've just finished the film, let's start examining it in the heat. At the opening of the film, there was a part that summed up the first film. It's nice to put it in, but it's unnecessary. I'm neutral in this scene, I can't call it good or bad.The next part shows the part before bride's ( Uma Thurman ) wedding. Bill comes alone before the wedding. He seems friendly, even attends the wedding ceremony, but then reveals his treacherous plan. To interpret it, it was nice that the scene was in black and white. Bill was older than I expected, but the actor who played him put in a good performance. And considering Bill's been with Bride before, he's too old.The wedding is happening.Bride wakes up from her coma.She's making a kill list.She cleans half of it.And then Bill's brother goes to Budd's. Budd goes to find out where Bill is or whether he will take revenge on him is not given any information about this, but the Budd character is well handled in the film. Bride is shot in the chest and buried alive while raiding Budd's caravan. Personally, it seemed absurd that the woman who dotted the Japanese Samurai Army in the first film was again made stupid in the second film. Come on, he was caught in the first movie, but he knew he was going to take action. As Budd buries him alive, he hands him a lantern and takes his sword to sell it to Ella, Bill's Assassin.In the next chapter, we go to the Bride's past. He breaks the coffin with his bare hands with his time next to his master, where he goes to learn the heart-blasting movement with 5 fingers, and what he learned there. A flashback scene that was put in place.At that time, Ella picks up the sword and poisons Budd, but he encounters the bride who comes out of the grave. Along with Ella bride's Hanzo sword, Bride and Budd's Hanzo sword begin to clash. Although the fist-to-fist battle took place in a very narrow area in the first place, I was a fan of the use of swords, and as soon as the swords came out, I said to myself, "" now I will see a beautiful duel. ""I said, but before I even finished my sentence, Bride took out one eye on Ella. It just destroyed my expectations of the stage. I expected a more epic encounter. I mean, if he was going to kill him by pulling out his eye, I wish it was after a little sword dancing.Then she goes to a Spanish man to find out where Bill is. He's finding out where Bill is. He's on his way to Bill's.When she comes to Bill's side, she encounters his own daughter, whom she does not know exists. At first, she seems to be close to Bill because the child is there, but when the child sleeps, the environment becomes tense. I found the speeches and performances that fit the personality of the actor who played Bill successful. I was expecting a big fight with Bill, but he just kills bill by making a heart-popping gesture with five fingers. It's not like the fight scenes in the first movie, it's simpler than the ones in this movie and it comes straight to the point. I thought Bill was right when Bill explained himself. Because it wasn't fair to bill that he ran away when Bride got pregnant with him while he was with her. Her revenge is a little cruel, but he has a reason. At first, when he suddenly disappears, he thinks bride is dead, grieves for 3 months, then leaves her with a child, and marries a record player in El Paso. I feel sorry for Bill if I have to empathize. Even the bride, who enjoyed taking revenge on the others she killed, cried after she killed Bill.After Bill dies, he takes his child and goes to a place where they will live together. The movie ends.If you look at the film in general, there is a disconnect in the story, but it does not stand out. Except Bill's old, his character choices are good. Acting is successful. Uma Thurman performed at the Oscars. The actor who played Bill's performance was very pleasant. Tarantino, like every movie, has added something to this movie. The soundtracks of the film are beautiful, even if they are one click lower than the first film, but they are not used much.As for the last words, it's a good series. Anyway, I think every Tarantino movie should be watched. It can even be viewed only for his first film.Kill Bill Vol 1: 79/100

My main negative is the scene where The Bride steps on Elle's eyeball after gouging it out. It was an extremely unnecessary shot to cut to.

There is more movie and less manic Kung Fu nonsense. David Carradine is great as the sly Bill and there are lots of great character bits. There were fewer long fight scenes, and there was actually a wealth of that depraved dialog that makes Tarantino films great. The epilogue scene was weak and useless, but what the heck, lots of good films have less than stellar moments. I still wish I could have watched a more compact 2.5 hour Bill movie, but wish in one hand...and, well, you know the rest. I see the second Bill movie ranks lower than the first in the top 250.

Some great, some good and some mostly inedible; most left my breath with a sour smell. Westerns, sci-fi, comedies, dramas, etc. After seeing Kill Bill Vol I, I assumed that any sequel would pale to its predecessor. I, of course, was premature in my prediction. The movie was, by all means, a classic. I feel Taratino was really trying to make a great movie versus making money for his producers. To build his tasty sandwich, he took the lessons he learned from life as a movie maker and cleverly managed to meld some slices of meat from Sergio Leone (subtly), Akira Kurosawa (very subtly) and, I'm stretching it here, Ridley Scott, to create a great sequel to an excellent first movie. He used some great, almost forgotten actors (Daryl Hannah, Micheal Parks, and David Carradine to create a memorable meal. It was only a sandwich, but what morsel it was. I was full and wanting more. Very rare to find this type of film in our corporate world. He must wield some real power in the movie world. I don't know of anyone who has saw this movie who hasn't given it great feedback. And I know all types of viewers. My wife, who really doesn't like anything that is not overly melancholy or dripping with sentimentality, actually liked the whole movie.

Volume 2 is more ""sophisticated"". The storytelling is as good as in volume 1, but here the focus is more on the story than on kicking butt. This is all good. Tarantino again shows that he's got more creative braincells than half of all the other Hollywood-directors together. Of course he's also very fu..ed up. I bet he would give Charles Manson a run for his money if he wouldn't focus all his violent energy on film making. Let's hope he continues to do so. One wish though. If he could just give therapy one (more?) chance we could hope for some extremely interesting movies in the future.

It seems strange that QT would get soft on his story of revenge and his viewers. I was not particularly impressed with David Carradine's final scene in the film, either. Too cerebrally, not fantastic enough.I also did not like how Elle Wood kills Bud, when I would have preferred to see ""Beatrix Kiddow"" get the job done.Despite my disappointment with the film as a whole, I did like the scenes of ""Kiddow"" on the mountains with the white-haired guru.

539,BIGHAIRY-1,Good but not great,6,2 May 2004,"As a stand alone action/drama, Kill Bill Vol.2 can be held against any film of this kind & would compare favourable. Which was why I had a problem with it. The standards that Mr Tarantino set in the first volume come no where near to being matched in terms of impact, style or balls. Don't get me wrong, KBV2 has some truly wonderful set pieces (the eye popping trailer catfight between Uma Thurman's Bride & Darryl Hannah's Elle Driver standing out) and some typical Tarantino humour. The performances are top notch too. Particularly David Carradine who portrays Bill with dignity & menace in equal measures. The problem I had with this film is that it's trying too hard to be a Tarantino film. It's packed with unneccesary dialogue that is trying to be cool & snappy (a usual QT trademark) yet over does it. Lines like ""wakey wakey eggs & bakey"" sound contrived, as if it is someone trying to write like Tarantino, rather than the man himself. And QT seems to have taken his directing style straight from the Sergio Leone school of film making. (The camera dollying out of the church to show the 4 assasins waiting out side is ripped out of most of Leone's spaghetti westerns) It's ok to parody someone, but to pilfer someone in this fashion feels a bit cheap. That said, it's still well worth a look. Especially if you've seen the first installment, as the characters are fleshed out a bit more & aren't as cartoony as in they were in Volume 1. You also get a cracking good flash back when the Bride is sent to train with Master Pai Mei (Gordon Liu). If however you haven't seen Volume 1 don't bother seeing it because it will probably confuse the hell out of you.

I think Europeans will not appreciate this movie which is made in pure cinematographic language without references to literature or history.  The scene with the outbreak of Uma out of the grave is physically impossible because of the weight-pressure of the earth. You simply cannot get out.  Daryl Hanah (Elle)is superb and looks younger than Uma! The fighting scenes are an absolute childification of the great Eastern fighting-movies.

I mean, if she just had sliced him to pieces it wouldn't have been as emotional as it is now. Bill just walks away and falls down slowly.The role that Michael Madsen played was small, but awesome. The Pai Mei bit was excellent (tarantino said his next film will be in this style, so I'm already looking forward to it) Daryl Hannah was convincing as the bitch Elle Driver. And some pieces were Hilarious.

542,kaplara,Kill Bill: Vol. 2,4,20 December 2004,"Kill Bill 2 is a movie whose plot is as simple as it's name. There is little below the surface here, but the movie simply runs amok on poorly developed characters and low grade action sequences. Yes I know the movie is designed to mock or make reference to many other movies, notably martial arts films, but rather then using those ""Hollywood"" moments to enhance something Tarantino uses them like a crutch. Most of this is due to the plot, which with nothing new to offer simply flows in a boring and contrived way. In addition no major roles seem capable of overwhelming the poor script and dry substance of the movie. Its as if everyone there has resigned themselves to the fact that the script and plot are dead, and act a little on the dead side themselves.Uma Thermon is clumsy and unconvincing as a vengeful super assassin. At least in the first movie one is capable of viewing the ridiculously over the top action with a bit of a grin and saying nuts to the plot. O ren also helps with a few fun lines like, ""the price for mentioning my Chinese heritage as a negative is, I collect your f@#king head."" O ren in general is more convincing though not great in her role. Uma's awkwardness forces Tarantino into doing what I often view as the first sign of a bad action movie. He uses up close shots of the characters during fast moments and distance shots during slow ones. This usually means that were one to view what just occurred from a distance, they would see it for what it is, clumsy and uncoordinated.Overall this movie retains some of it's director's excellent tough mostly through the visuals, which taken as a picture rather then a moving film as breath taking. Tarantino makes use of start color contrasts to give one a sense of texture and beauty beyond the norm. Were I in the poster business I could take a thousand frames of this movie and make them into wonderful pieces of art. I should also note that I still believe in Tarantino, movies with finesse and masterful dialogues such as Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction do not happen by accident and shine no less for the latter mistakes of their maker.

Ever since I saw Reservoir Dogs, I've had some issues with Tarantino - edgy, one-dimensional characters, forced and cringeworthy dialogues, shock value violence that doesn't add anything to the story etc. And all those issues are on full display in this movie. And on the top of that our main protagonist is a superhero in this movie, she can do anything. Anything! It all just seems very silly.

545,sith-7,Why did it all go wrong. (possible spoilers),4,25 April 2004,"I really enjoyed Vol 1, so I waited for Vol 2 with great anticipation.  I have been sadly let down.  This film is a trip into Mr T's self indulgent mind. There are far too many monologues along with unecessary scenes.  The opening at the church.  This was not needed, we knew what happened from the first film.  We didn't need it repeated in slow and boring detail without seeing the actual blood bath that ensued.  As Uma is meant to be the ultimate female assassin, how did she fall for the oldest trick in the book at Bud's trailer???  Anyone with commonsense knows you fling the door open but don't fill the space.  For an assassin she was particularly thick. Once in the casket we have to endure yet another flash back to explain how she breaks out.  Any martial arts fan will know, we don't need a somewhat tedious flashback.  She has already proved a skilled warrior in the martial arts in the first film.  Which brings me to the master.  So he falls to poison fish heads. :rolleyes:  For a master that is trained and highly skilled in mind and body control, he doesn't notice the poison!  Bud - He is meant to be a psychotic nutter.  So why does he let himself get pushed around at the titty bar???? The trailer - a Black Mamba is on the loose, but the girls don't seem to care.  I was expecting a major sword fight, didn't happen.  Quite unexpected eye gouge. I appreciated the link with the master.  We get long boring segments with Uma and Bill.  Playing the flute while she lies in front of the fire.  Bill's monologue about Superheroes.  Yes, we get it.  But please, it could have been quicker.  Which leads to the climax.  For someone who has so much hatred and anger and someone with so much to lose, I was expecting a huge climactic battle between the two foes.   No, just a little clever sword play and the exploding heart combo. Sad letdown. Where was the drawn out suffering for Bill that he showed to Bea. 
  Basically Vol 1 should have been an hour longer with the same tight script with the action continue to flow.  Instead we get Vol 2 which Tarantino has had to bloat, destroy and slow down. A real shame.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

I mean lets get serious people! a film that pokes fun at the brilliant and solid Hollywood genre, a film with intelligent dialogue and shattered clinches, a film that even makes David Carradine look like a real actor first time since Kung Fu the TV series, a film that pretends to aspire to the greats of Shindlers list with its use of lighting and black and white pallet!I mean WTF, I ask why!I have one thing to say to you Mr GT, go back to being a video store clerk and let us the masses drown our stupidity in the bowels of our despair and pointless, factory produced movie flicks.

548,archangelH8,"As a whole, one of the best films I've witnessed",10,18 April 2004,"After viewing Kill Bill: Vol. 2 this weekend, I've come to the strong conclusion that I need Quentin to release a special dvd edition as soon as possible with both films together as one.  The sooner the better because this film, Kill Bill, as a whole blows me away and I cannot wait for its release.  Volume 2 was just as good, maybe even better than the first, with its strong dialogue and flawless performances by Gordon Liu, Uma Thurman, and David Carradine.  Carradine truly delivers a great performance as Bill, no longer the evil man behind the sword but an actual sympathetic character. Granted, he ""overreacted"" but we finally get a chance to see who he was and the whole background to the Bride and Bill.  Overall, this film gives well needed closure to Uma Thurman's character and thus ends a great Tarantino tale.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
549,gadflyzzz,Death is a cheap stunt played for amusment,3,3 February 2005,"There's no trick to Kill Bill Volumes 1 & 2. Vol 1 presents slimly drawn characters engaged in a ballet of violence. Vol 2 gives their back story. That's some genius, I'll say.I have serious problems with the pivotal conceit of the Bride's character (here's the spoiler): the moment she discovers she's pregnant is the moment she disavows violence. Huh? How come? Why should the fact that she has 'life' growing inside her suddenly turn 'life' into something to now cherish and respect? Is she just selfish, or self-obsessed? Why is a fetus any more valuable than any of the lives she snuffed out as a paid assassin? Truth is this film has no respect for life of any sort. Murder is an occupation like any other. Killing is a calling. Death is a cheap stunt played for laughs or curious novelty. Dead babies are merely narrative triggers to go out and do more killing. There are a few cheap laughs in Kill Bill Vol 2. There's some effective suspense and a bit of canny art direction here and there. The actors sure think they're making something worth putting in a hard day's work. The gaping holes in the plot and the zero plausibility don't seem to get the way of their dedication. Poor old David Carradine thinks this is the greatest opportunity of his entire career (so he says on the DVD marketing featurette). He needs to go back and watch Bergman's THE SERPENT'S EGG again. There's a film that knows about humanity's dark heart. It didn't need to pick it up third hand at a comic convention.Watching this film is like being urinated on from a great height. I'm sad I've contributed to the maintenance of Tarantino's lifestyle. There's something anesthetizing about this film. It's got no soul, a dead heart, and constantly requiring shots of adrenalin to give the appearance of signs of life. Stylish it may be. Entertaining even. But in the end, it lacks the gravitas it so clearly craves. I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE has more integrity. Go ahead. Waste a coupla hours and a coupla bucks. Who cares?",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
550,weissbier,Pope's fart isn't necessarily holy,5,28 April 2004,"Who reads the backgrounds knows that the script wanted bill to kill the wedding guests. It was the minute before taking the scene that Tarantino decided to have Bills contract killers it done... to me it explains why I couldn't figure the logic behind it. Neither did I find one behind the fact that this supposed world class killer Kiddo EVERY time is fooled by her victims and only by one chance or another survives... Which completes the picture: Urma may confuse the hormones of many men, mine she doesn't. Thats why I could concentrate on the film and what I saw was an urban woman in her twenties that did not know how to handle a sword nor had the charisma that matches a determined killer. (A minimum requirement even for an absurd plot, I would say).What some other pictures of Tarantino have and the reason why I will repeat them to watch till my end of days are the charismatic characters in it. Without exception, you have to love them, the good, the bad as well as the ugly. In Kill Bill? Marginally the sheriff, Budd and ...more just don't come to my mind... There was no spell and some nice shots or funny details (the best: the dead body in the coffin has his hand risen so a rabbit head-shadow is casted on the lid) didn't keep me awake. Disappointing how money and/or fame (or whatever) have made Tarantino's mind lazy. The story was uninspired, totally profane; a woman has left her friend. He is a killer and reacts freaky. End. LOL! Just silly.As other precedent critics wrote, in 5 years, people remind this piece as they will Roger Rabbit or Wayne's World: something new but nothing to watch ever again.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
551,magnoliafanboy,"A masterpiece with eyeballs, trailers and soul",10,18 April 2004,"(minor spoilers)Kill Bill vol. 2 is a masterpiece.  It is the standard at what American Films should be measured on. Watching this one time you will begin to feel there is hope for us all that love cinema.Where do I begin? Tarantino has gone the extra mile in every possible way. Some may say this surpasses Vol. 1, but that person must also consider the fact that this is just the second half of one great big film.  All the action and visual quickness of Vol.1 was just a bit of collateral that would get the viewer to invest in the remaining of the film where it does unfold into longer character sketches and digs deep into the psyche of Uma's THE Bride.This is a film that like everything Tarantino does, pays homage and tips his funny little hat to everything he, and you and I, have seen and twists it perfectly into something purely original.From the opening of Uma driving with the processed sound stage background that contains south of the border palm trees behind her reminded me a lot of Hitchcock's Notorious.  The image of the beautiful blonde driving is similar to Ingrid Bergman's beginning in that film.  This may be Quentin's way of saying this is his star, just like Hitchcock showcased his actress's in a timeless way.There are images and situation galore that resonate all the films he loves(Master of the Flying Guillotine, Five Finger of Death and Bruce Lee's work) and the directors that Tarantino loves, like the Fulci inspired buried alive scene, the the ongoing Leone western motif and yes Quentin is still professing his love for Brian De Palma.  At first it seems to be the quick split screen that goes into effect as Uma and Darryl Hannah square off.  The last time you saw these two together in Vol.1 their was an ode to De Palma's Dressed to Kill and the echo is felt as the two women's brawl here. But it is more a gesture to Carrie, because in that film the split screen is thrown in just as all hell is about to break loose in the school gym- in Tarantino's universe it will be in the trailer somewhere tucked away in the San Fernando Valley. And we see as Uma raises from her burial a shot of a hand shooting out of the grave just like the end of Carrie.What I liked most was the shot of the Bride standing on top of a hill looking down on Budd's trailer which reminded me of Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes.  It wasn't really a shot stolen from that film exactly, but it is framed similar to the artwork of that films poster, with the trailer sitting at the bottom of a small valley waiting as prey.  And in this film, Uma is the predator to those inside this trailer.  And I will go one step further, because in the scene that follows inside the trailer you see a poster of the Charles Bronson film  Mr. Majestyk .  With this in mind, please remember the scene in the Hills Have Eyes when all the terror of the canniball's attack is going on in the trailer and you see the poster of Jaws.  Rumor/ Legend has it that Craven placed that poster in the trailer as a statement:""you think that movie was scarry? This film(Hills) you are watching is much more terrifying"".  So with that, can we say that the Bronson poster is making a statement, not about the film itself, but about the persona of Uma Thurman's the Bride.  I think Quentin is saying, ""Chuck Bronson was one of cinema's all time bad asses, but you know what after this is all over, Uma is gonna be right up there with him"".  I might be wrong, but it's fair to say that I might not be too off.And with all these homages Tarantino has his on style. If this film was in the hand of someone like Michael Bay, we would be shown ten minutes of unnecessay slow motion and bullet point of view action during the Chapel Massacre. But not here, instead we see almost ten minutes of dialogue preceding the Massacre and the pull away and out of the building as the chaos insues. Just like Reservior Dogs, it is not the heist that mattered- it is how those involved in the incident deal with it afterwards that creates the real drama.Uma Thurman steals the whole show, because she runs the gammit of persona. We see her as a violent/vengful survivor,to an eager kung fu student and as puddy in Bill's hands when she is at the pinnacle of her love for him. This is so well written and the acting by everyone(Carridean, Hannah, Madsen) seals the deal.   The black comedy thrown in at the most perfect of moments sooth us from all the gore being handed our way.Not to give anything away, but the ending will sqeeze you in every way. This is a film with more going than eyeballs popping out and white trash bitch fights.  It has a soul all its own.  Their is an abundance of  subtext here. Where does a girl become a woman?  In the most womanly of manner the expectancy of new life can make you change the way you live your life for a better tomorrow.  This film may have feminist joining Tarantino's side, but most of all those that cheer for most humane in all of us will love this movie.This is a film that covers similar film avenues; revenge, killing, death and love.  But what sets it apart is its manner/how we are  shown and told about all these things we have seen before.  This is original and it is worthy of all the hype.  It is now in my top five of all time favorite films.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
552,Flickkiller,8.2 you've got to be kidding,2,2 January 2005,"Usually a director would get to at least his fifties before he forgot how to make a movie. Like so many wunderkind this guy reads too much of his own press. The extended dialogues of his earlier work at least had some original thoughts. This film is laced with clichés and generic characters. I didn't like the first one but it at least had some interesting and different film styles. This one plods on like a wounded animal just waiting to be shot. Who cares if she kills him or not. The fight scenes are good but like a Hong Kong action film you have to suffer though endless dialogue. And this film is nowhere near as cool as he thinks it is. Don't waste your time, this is a dried up husk with nothing to offer it's audience.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

554,TexNickle,Watched 'em Back to Back,8,28 September 2004,"Due to some problems that I won't go into here, I missed the theatrical release of Vol. 1. So I got the idea to just sit and wait. Why not let Vol. 2 finish it's run too, then when I can have them both on DVD, run them back to back in my home theater.And I have to say, once I finally did it, it was fun, and well worth the wait. From the moment those crazy 1970's lobby cards came up at the start of Vol. 1, to the cool animation, thru that awesome homage flashback bit with the white haired master, and on to the final unbelievable finish, it was a riot.Not great cinema, but a lot of fun, a great night of entertainment.If you have a sense of humor, and know anything about the cinema of the 1970's, I think you will really enjoy this film. And so what that it's volumes 1 and 2, it's one movie, without question.I'm Tex Nickle and that's all I have to say about Kill Bill.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
555,dimitrispappas-71186,A Movie Full Of Awesomeness,10,17 November 2018,"''The Bride continues her quest of vengeance against her former boss and lover Bill, the reclusive bouncer Budd and the treacherous, one-eyed Elle Driver.''
Starring: Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Daryl Hannah, Michael Madsen...Kill Bill Vol. 2 adds extra plot and dialogue to the action-heavy exploits of its predecessor, while still managing to deliver a suitably hard-hitting sequel/continuation. It's almost a completely different film to the first. Where Vol. 1 is purely action-driven with a lot of uncensored blood & gore, this one is exactly the opposite. The humor of the first volume is gone, the adventure is partly decreased and the tone becomes more serious and dramatic. It however makes up for it as we learn what The Bride's real name is, what happened to her baby, how the massacre happened and more character development for Budd, Elle and Bill. The first volume had some excellent scenes and fantastic direction, but lacked depth in its story. Vol. 2 provides this backing, and does it in an immersive way. With Tarantino having scenes show us past events throughout the film, it allows us to know more backstory about the characters, but in a non-boring way. Every moment feels like it was expertly directed and well put together. There is perhaps only one or two moments of actual violence in this film, the rest is purely story and character driven.
Uma Thurman once again, impresses as The Bride, and this time her character is allowed to become a real human being driven by emotions beyond those connected to a desire for revenge. Bill is a superb character creation of Tarantino's, and he is easily one of the best, most terrifying, interesting and intelligent movie villains of all time. While the story is enthralling throughout, where the film reaches its true potential is in the final act. You'd be surprised if you expect an extravagant and lengthy final battle between The Bride and Bill, as that's what we've been lead to believe by watching the first volume. What Tarantino gives us instead is a taught, tense and sublimely written final conversation between the two characters.
Though some of the dialogues are lengthy, everything just fell into place as the movie progressed to its climax. Kill Bill Vol. 2 is all about the emotional dilemma and conflicts that result to unimaginable consequences. It is less kinetic but more satisfying. Actually, Vol. 1 is 90% style and 10% substance while Vol. 2 is 90% substance and 10% style. Totally, the two films are different, which may be the result of the split. Overall, Vol. 2 contains less action, less fight scenes, but more of backstory, depth, dialogue and better character development.In Conclusion:
Overall, Tarantino delivers a wonderful cult-style film with a fluent mixture of samurai and western style. Kill Bill plays out much like the concept of revenge itself - actions and instincts engulf us at first, but as time goes on and the journey rampages toward its ultimate conclusion, truth and meaning quickly take over. Where Tarantino starts off with a bang, he rightfully finishes off with a shock to our system - maturity and philosophical contemplation on the subject of revenge and what it means for those involved. As a whole, Kill Bill is utterly unified, possesses a strong, dramatic ark, and, above all, stands as quite possibly the most passionate, loving tribute to cinema ever made.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

I watched Kill Bill Vol 1, didn't love it, the only reason that kept myself from hating was Uma. Then, I gave Vol. 2 a shot, not the best. The only thing I enjoyed in this film was Bill, and the last parts of dialogue between Bill and Kiddo. I felt the cast wasn't well chosen, the action scenes were mediocre, and the dialogue was decent. My ratings for previous QT films were: Reservoir Dogs (10/10), Pulp Fiction (10/10), Jackie Brown (8/10).

It is also filled with meaningless torture and violence scenes, that usually occur only in anti-hero movies. By which I mean, that the 'hero' gets his/her butt kicked in every fight.I really hope that Tarantino won't produce such a piece of crap ever again.Thank god I paid only to see the first volume.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

First one was a masterpiece for me and maybe rate it around 9/10 while second one maybe avove average 6/10. Really don't understand all the top ratings for this movie i've seen almost all Quentin Tarantino movies and Kill Bill vol 2 is probably the worst i've seen.

As Kill Bill Vol 1 was all out action and simplistic dialogue so Kill Bill Vol 2 was a journey into the personas of all the main characters. i cant believe people are saying that they liked the first film but hated the second . the 2 films are QT,s double edged 'sword' his yin and yang of his Film Life. Vol 1 is his male/ yang side ,all testosterone and bang ! bang ! explosive side . Vol 2 is his female/ yin side , delving more deeply into the reasons and emotions of why The Bride is hell bent on seeking to ""Kill Bill !"". All the performances are great but Uma and david are absolutely outstanding Plus Michael Parks who i hardly recognized asa 70 year old mexican. The music is the soul of both films and demonstrates thats QT is the master of the record collection ! My fav scene is  probably when The Bride remembers her teachings of Pai Mei ,this scene got the hairs to stand up on the back of my kneck ! but there are too many to mention and i recommend you find out the gems for yourself.

563,morc-4,Best Tarantino Film,10,25 August 2007,"Yes.. I know many of you will disagree and claim that Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs is the best QT film. But as I did, you will also grow up and see the splendour that is this film.I first saw this movie 3 years ago and found it quite boring, actually. I thought that Kill Bill 1 was better and had more fighting in it. Now 3 years later, I just watched them again and I can't believe how unobservant I was back then. This time, I could see 1000 things more than I could 3 years ago. This is not only about violence, but also about the sheer beauty of atmosphere and dialogue.Tarantino has topped his career with volume 2 of Kill Bill. The atmospheres he captures in this film is among the best I have ever experienced. The music and sound is the best in a movie since Pulp Fiction. The dialogue, especially with David Carradine is so sophisticated, that I demand an Oscar for Carradine for the way he carries that out. Sitting in front of the fireplace playing his flute and telling stories. Surprising Uma with her child and charming her and being so cool about every situation always coming up with brilliant lines. Bravo! A guy I didn't even know existed, made me shiver with his performance and he does it just as good as David Carradine. Kill Bills ""father"" played by Michael Parks delivers one of the best performances, I have ever witnessed. He plays some 80 years old Mexican-American whorehouse manager far out in nowhere whom Uma Thurman drives to see to get to know where Bill is. An Oscar to Michael Parks would have been in it's place. He is so slick and disgusting and I don't know what it is he does with his face, but it is genius! That calmness of his voice. A Don Juan and with an accent and a way of speaking, that I have never seen before. Wow! Michael Parks also plays the father of the two cops we see in kill bill one in the church, and I liked him very much in that part as well.David Carradine deserves an Oscar for his role as the boss Bill. He is so great and sophisticated, so well articulate and cultivated, so charming that you almost get to like him. But you can always see through him and you know that he is an evil soab and you are never sure where you've got him. You are never sure, if he really has good intentions. Remember to see the deleted scene on the DVD! Here you get to see him fight. You don't in the real film.Uma Thurman is also extremely brilliant in this movie. In the scene, where she is at the wedding rehearsal and meets Bill outside of the church, I could read her mind. An expression tells more than a thousand words.Michael Madsen and Darryl Hannah have great roles as well and carries them out beautifully.The last character I would like to mention who contributes to making this film as great as it is, is Pai Mei played by Gordon Liu. He is the comic relief of the film and he does an excellent job as the mysterious supernatural Chinese mentor far out in the jungle. He actually also plays Johnny Mo in Kill Bill 1! I could go on and on.. The bottom line is, that every word spoken in this film and how it is carried out has been put thought into. If you like great acting, you have to see this film. If you love great fighting scenes, you should see it as well as they are totally amazing. All of them.10/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
564,Alpie,A Poor Imitation Of A QT Movie,4,5 July 2006,"My opinions on the first film were ""hmm, very different, lets see where this goes in the next volume"" When I finally did watch volume two, I cannot fully describe my disappointment. Not just with the film but with Quinton Tarantino. To me, he hadn't directed this movie, he basically ticked the boxes of people expect of him. Non-Linear story Chapaterised; Classic songs; Interesting dialogue; References to dozens of films from various decades from various genres.To be fair to him, he did tick all of them but what he ticked them with was very lame stuff, but the overall product was just plain disappointing. And it seems to me that it has got to a point where Tarantino's ego has become more important than the script. Ultimately I get the feeling that Tarantino has peeked with Pulp Fiction, but he is deluded in to thinking that is he can deliver that every time. I think that he has lost his ""voice"" in the same way I think Kevin Smith has lost his. The spark/flare in the dialogues that were in his earlier films has gone, what we get instead is stuff which is very laboured. Likewise the use of music in his films, he has used the music so badly in this film it is unbelievable.I guess the best analogy that I could give is M.Night Shyamalan films, you go watch his films expecting a twist, and when he does deliver the twist, you are kind of left disappointed with it. Likewise you go to watch a QT film expecting the stuff mentioned above, and what you get isn't what you had hoped.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Too bad it drags on, and on, and on....So much that you begin to get bored with the scenes.Tarantino tries way to hard to make this an epic movie, but if it falls flat on its face. There is way too much discourse. The dialogue has none of the magic from his earlier works. All of the characters begin to sound like people who are trying to prove how smart they can sound.Plus, he again tries to resurrect an actor's career (see Travolta, Grier) but Daryl Hannah who is just brutal.Honestly, Vols 1 & 2 could have been compressed into one film.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

I saw it in what could be the best considered cirumstances, and I sincerely believe it would have been a better night had I not seen it (and seen Crank instead.) So much talking, so much bullcrap, not enough cuttin dudes up. Uma gets shot but she punches her way out of a coffin and there's an old Asian dude with glued-on eyebrows... The yellowbook guru guy turned out to be Bill...She even ditched the Pussy Wagon. I think this is a symbol of what happened to the movie. It left behind the cool, the excitement, in favor of story and dialogue, but it just didn't work.And it's not just that I hate dialogue-heavy movies. 12 Angry Men was all dialogue, and that's one of the best films ever made, I think.

In this movie there's only two 'good' scenes to watch (remember) and that's when Uma first goes to Madsen and he shoots her and second when Uma meets Darly Hannah. After that fight scene the movie just get boring for another hour.I expected a 'big' fight scene between Uma and David Carradine (Bill) but everything was over in few seconds which was quite disappointing.And the thing that bothered me the most was that Uma hardly even says anything in this movie and the thing that everyone says how good and sexy she looks, when her look in 'Kill Bill' is definitely her worst look ever.Uma used to be really hot (remember 'Batman & Robin' or 'The Avengeres'), but she looks exhausted and very old for her real age in this two movies.All in all, i expected much more from both of 'Kill Bill' but i think it's obvious that Tarantino's best movie was 'Pulp Fiction' and that's the far-est he can go.I give this movie 4/10 and the first part 5/10.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
568,HATED_IT,"Not as good as Volume One, but still enjoyable.",7,8 July 2004,"The main difference between Volume on and Two, is that in the latter, Tarantino ditches the violence in favor of the dialouge. That's not to say there aren't some great action scenes, but it felt a little uneven after all the fighting in Volume One. Like I said, it does have some adrenaline pumping scenes, like the fight between The Bride and Elle, the training scenes with Pae Ming (forgive me if that is not his name, but it's something along those lines), and the chilling burying of The Bride's living body, but it couldn't hold a candle to the adrenaline rush I got from Volume One. I know this movie was supposed to focus more on the plot, and the dialouge in this ones will feel right at home compared to Tarantino's other movies. But I still felt a little cheated, especially the way Bill was killed. I was hoping for a much grander final showdown between him and The Bride.Maybe it was just because I was wowed so much with Volume One, and the way it unfolded, but Volume Two just seemed to fall out a bit to straight forward for a Tarantino movie. Non the less I did enjoy the film in particular the amazing performance of David Carradine, who seems to be the next Travolta that Tarantino pulled out of post fame B-Movie obscurity. I will say right here that Carradine deserve at the least an Oscar nomination for his role. In fact, all of the cast give great performances, and there are no weak links.7/10PS- You don't need to see the first one to go into this, in fact it may make Volume One more enjoyable if you see it after this.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
569,sm22281-1,Awesome unique story told in a fascinating East meets West vision,10,17 April 2004,"Spoiler Alert! I agree with the comments already posted, about the first movie being more Asian Kung Fu and rampage action killing scenes, and the second movie giving more characterization and explaining the entire story.This movie kept me riveted on my seat the whole time, whether an action fight scene broke out, or the characters just kept talking.  Each actor is fleshed out as an interesting, complex individual, including Budd, Elle, Pai-Mei, and most of all, Beatrix and Bill.This is a very complex movie with many layers and elements and I am still digesting and processing the scenes.  What did I like?  What did I not like or not understand?  What do I remember as striking?Well, there is an ongoing sense of razor-sharp, never yielding cold-steel purpose portrayed by Uma Thurman's heroine.  Not just the self-dialogue voice-over as she drives to meet her final targets.  The intense fury in her eyes as she is caught in a death trap and her violent struggles; the endurance she demonstrates as she undergoes the tough physical training (think of Demi Moore as a soldier, it's even more intense) and most importantly, her mental acknowledgment of the superior master; her focused calm while she tries to get out of the death trap; in her exhausted state, her drive to hike back many miles in the desert to find the killer (Madsen). This is a woman who will never ever give up.  I like this determination as portrayed in the movie.  That's guts! One striking scene is the heroine striding across the street to the diner, dirt flying off her in the dim lighting, and her superhuman determination to keep herself together and to keep going.The mental submission and acknowledgment of the grand master is a key to Asian Kung Fu movies.  Beatrix's mental toughness and ability to endure any impossibly tough circumstances gave her the edge in every life and death situations she meets.  Beatrix's submission and respect of the grand old master is what gives her the edge over the other assassin, Elle.  Elle lost her temper and lost first one eye, now the second.  And finally, Beatrix is the only student of Pai-Mei's who earns his respect and learns the famous death punch.  So, the serious determined good student wins at the end.  I kind of like that ending.  If you will recall, the central theme in Hidden Tiger Crouching Dragon was the female warrior girl who could not accept anyone being her master and ended wreaking havoc on everyone's life.However, I found several scenes a little confusing.  For example, how come the gun shot from Budd took her out in one volley, stunned her, but there was no visible gun shot wounds or after effects?  How is that possible? Also, the shirt and jacket she was wearing showed no wounds in the back, so I was very confused about her ability to bounce back from that incident. Even with her kind of determination, how did she overcome serious bleeding wounds?   If she was such a good assassin, why was it so easy for a man with a gun to take her out in one shot?   The other scene in the hotel room where the Asian female assassin tries to shoot her shows that Beatrix is very fast and not that easy to kill.  So I find it difficult to understand how she gets toppled over in one try by Budd.  That was an anticlimax for me.Why does Budd turn into a ""modern"" loser, when he seems to have the same assassin skills as Bill?  Budd says that he deserves to die for participating in Beatrix's execution, yet he has no wish to let that happen and he takes care to execute Beatrix again, in revenge for breaking his brother's heart.  Why does Budd keep the samurai sword inscribed with Bill's loving caption but tells his brother that it was pawned off?  He seems very ambivalent about his life and his relationship with Bill.  Clearly a complex kind of man.Why is the scene at the Two Pines Chapel shot in black and white?  Apart from the fact that it's a different technical style and look.  I was wondering if it was meant to cast that entire episode of Beatrix's life as a scene that is almost surreal, or unreal in her mind, not part of the existing colorful intensity of her current life.At the end, when Beatrix tries to reach the sword and gets a couple of warning shots from Bill, it seems incongruous that Beatrix, a well-trained assassin, is not be able to get at a weapon on the first try.  It seems that anyone with a gun can easily gain the upper hand on the sword and knife style of killing.On the other hand, Beatrix demonstrates that at close range and in a tight spot, she does not need weapons, she has awesome powers with her FINGERS! alone.  So the old school fist fighting skills still triumph over the gun shooting style, that's the secret power.What does the scene in the classroom flashing Beatrix Kiddo as a school pupil mean?  The only thing I got is that her last name is Kiddo, it is not an affectionate nickname from Bill as we might have thought earlier.I had a little trouble understanding every single word said by David Carradine so I will have to see the movie again.  His acting is very compelling in this movie, the best I have ever seen.  He comes across as courteous and guarded, then relaxed and playful, then intellectual and tender, that's awesome.  Yes, the scene between the two of them is very powerful.  The death scene is very different from most final scenes in a revenge story.  There is a feeling of deep respect (of each other's killing skills) and love between the two antagonists, almost like in a Samurai fight.  When he realizes he is dying, she touches him with a final gentle pat.  He gets up and meets his death in a gentlemanly, courtly manner, with great courage, very ""old school"" as his character says.As a woman, I had difficulty understanding why Beatrix felt she had to kill Bill at the very end.  Yes, Bill executed her and her friends in a fit of passionate hatred at the beginning of the story  But Bill also kept the baby alive and raised her tenderly. So could this act of love be his redemption, and could the heroine forgive him, and why not let them live happily ever after?  Then I realized that his parenting style was very strange, he discussed the child's stomping of the goldfish like some of us exclaim in delight at a child mastering the ABC's and he lets the child watch assassination movies at bedtime.  That's why Beatrix rejected him and his lifestyle, she could not allow him to live, it had become a choice of zero sum game, a life and death choice between his twisted lifestyle and the innocent child.  It reminds me of the Samurai execution in Tom Cruise's 2003 movie, where the winner Samurai watches the loser and helps him die, but with deep respect, dignity and love.The scene with the Mexican octogenarian was very interesting.  At first, it was not too clear why there was such a consummate conversation going on when the director might have used a voice over saying that Beatrix obtained Bill's address by looking up an old acquaintance.  I had to think about this scene for a while to ponder the significance.  The meaning is this is Bill's background, his childhood parent figure and this explains the kind of person he is.  A murderer, a man who uses other women and men for his business income, a man who is used to lording it over women and who will not take no (rejection) as an answer and will abuse, maim and kill at the drop of a hat. See the shot of the serving woman with the grotesquely split lip, that's what happens to those who do not comply in that world Bill knows best.Anyway, what are the hallmarks of a good movie, in my mind? that it should be technically excellent, visually compelling, and the story  should not only entertain but also  give me plenty to think about after the movie ends, and this is one of very few movies that meet my standard.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

571,Mulholland-95,The conclusion of the Bride's revenge,10,20 May 2017,"Kill Bill Vol. 2, the second part of the fourth film of Quentin Tarantino, is a homage to spaghetti western and martial arts movies.After of the Bride defeated to Vernita Green and O-Ren Ishii, she must cope with Elle Driver, Budd and his brother, Bill. The beginning, like in the previous film, has a strong scene because we see when Bill shoots to the Bride and she tell us directly about her revenge's travel and her final objective: Kill Bill.The elements of spaghetti western films present in this movie are: - The desert environment. - The rough and tough characters. - The dirty aesthetic. - The soundtrack for gives more intensity to confrontation scenes: the Bride & Bill, the Bride vs the grave, the Bride vs Elle. In my opinion, these scenes are the best of this film.As a curiosity, Tarantino uses part of the Ennio Morricone's soundtrack from 'The good, the bad and the ugly' in the chapter six, when Bill finds the Bride.The elements of martial arts films present in Kill Bill Vol. 2, especially in chapter 8, are: - The story about the Old China. - The Kung-fu fights. - The hard training for become a great warrior. - The respect to the master and the revenge for his murder.The movie is divided into five parts: - The chapter six (The massacre of Two Pines): The Bride remembers the last essay of her wedding. - The chapter seven (The lonely grave of Paula Schultz): The Bride confronts to Budd but she is buried alive. - The chapter eight (The cruel tutelage of Pai Mei): The Bride remembers her training with Pai Mei. - The chapter nine (Elle and I): Budd dies and, Elle and the Bride fights - The last chapter (Face to face): Beatrix Kiddo goes to Mexico, she faces to Bill and she discovers that her daughter is alive.This second part is really good for this long revenge story, so anyone can feel satisfaction for conclusion of this film.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
572,capataz_de_cargadores,3.5/5 Very Good. Recommended viewing,7,1 December 2004,"Starring: Uma Thurman, David Carradine, Michael Madsen, Daryl Hannah, Chia Hui Liu, Samuel L. JacksonPlot Synopsis: 2 down, 3 to go. The Bride (Uma Thurman) continues her hunt for the masochistic Bill (David Carradine) in part 2 of Quentin Tarantino's pop culture styled duo-logy.In part 2, we see Tarantino's influences shift from Asian cinema to the spaghetti western, with the stylings of the likes of Sergio Leone featuring heavily. This is possibly one of the smartest decisions on Tarantino's part as the kung-fu novelty of the first film having well and truly run its course.One of the most disappointing aspects of Volume 1 was the lack of witty dialogue that has defined Tarantion's CV thus far. In volume 2, we see a return to form, with Bill's superhero monologue one of the most memorable moments of the film. While, the action is still intense and fast paced, it is not the carnage of Vol.1, with the aforementioned dialogue now playing a much greater role. Thus, Vol.2 is in many ways a more well-rounded and deeper film than its predecessor.Though not as frenetic as the previous film, Vol.2 nevertheless has more to offer. It's just a shame that Miramax had to split the film in 2 parts in the first place. And I thought Tarantino was the last person to place the commercial pursuits of Miramax ahead of his art...",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

One woman who wrote on this film complained about how blood spurting out is not realistic. This is because these films are more of a tribute to the old Kung Fu films, camera styles, gore, costumes, etc. Scene's are pinched from odd films and recreated. This is Tarintino's homage to those films, don't see this as some highly original film, because it's been done before, in more ways than one.This film is good, if you're knowledgeable (SP) enough to appreciate it.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
574,irmddj,Well... It's another Tarantino.,6,22 April 2005,"The first attempt to view Kill Bill 2 on DVD failed, as the rental store inadvertedly gave me Kill Bill. Second time around, I made sure there was a '2' on there. I settled in, a Texas Tea within my reach (how ironic) and fired up the DVD.And well over two hours later, I'm writing this review.Kill Bill 2 picks up where its prequel stopped: The woman who was brutally shot in the head by 'Bill' at the beginning of the first movie is still off to kill every last person who aided Bill in killing her and her soon-to-be-husband. She already killed two, and now there's three more on her list.The first thing which immediately becomes apparent is that the tone of the movie is completely different than in its predecessor. Instead of excessive martial arts scenes with lots of gore and blood spouting all over the place, we have a much more timid, carefully laid down plot which seeks to answer all questions the first movie raised. (Well, not all, like why Hanzo made a new sword for Kiddo, a.k.a. Mommy, played by Thurman.) Combat is limited to the strictly necessary, with the Final Fight being surprisingly short but to some extent quite predictable.Despite the good, artistic camera-work, at times gripping and evocative scenes (Kiddo being buried alive, Kiddo meeting her daughter) and good, to the point dialogue, the movie somehow failed to spark my interest. Perhaps because it is so tame in comparison to the first movie: remember, we are dealing with a *continuation* of the story. Perhaps because all the bad guys admit that Kiddo deserves her revenge: where's the fun in killing off the bad guys who admit to being bad? Okay, they certainly don't intend to put their heads on the chopping block willingly, but still. Perhaps because you know already that everyone is going to die a horrible death, and that of course, Kiddo will find Bill, and kill him. Perhaps she will die in the process, but kill him she will. Perhaps because about 1/4th into the movie, you know *how* Bill is going to die. Or, perhaps when you see Kiddo being shot in the breast by Bill's run-down bro, Budd. Excuse me, but if you can handle well over 100 well-trained swordsmen, you do *not* run into the line of fire of an ex-killer with booze for blood.There are plenty of little surprises and twists to the tale, so it takes a while to get to the end. But because you know what the end will, has to, must be, and because the movie takes on a completely different character, it becomes somewhat slow and boring. I am sure there are plenty of people who will be lyrical about the entire thing, citing the good character interplay, sneaky twists, the stark contrast with movie one yet holding up its own without effort, and lots, lots more. You can read it in the other reviews. I can certainly understand why those things have been, are being and will be said. Problem is, I am not plenty of people. On its own, good movie, make sure you see it. As a continuation of a story of brutal revenge... No.6 out of 10.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
575,FZ-FX,The tribute film that could,9,10 April 2005,"While Kill Bill was originally intended to be one film, somewhere along the line the decision was made to split it into two parts, and it's quite surprising just how well this works. On the surface, volume 2 is the Spaghetti Western half of Tarintino's tribute to cult films. But when you compare to two movies on a deeper level, they're dramatically different films.The first half of the Kill Bill saga was essentially an extended romp that introduced the characters, conflicts and mythology of the story through highly stylized action scenes. Slower paced, with significantly less action and outlandish violence, Volume 2 is a departure from the original. But what it loses in action and style it more than substance. While the plot is still a revenge story, it's one of the most complex and humanized revenge sagas ever put on film. The central aspect of the plot is the relationship between the Bride (Thurman) and Bill (Carradine). Both of these characters turn out to be surprisingly deep, and through excellent dialog and acting we can understand their relationship to one another, as well as the supporting characters. This slowly builds up and comes to a head with their meeting. Some complained that the final confrontation was anti-climatic, but I couldn't disagree more. It's a deeply emotional moment for both characters, and is the perfect conclusion for the Bride's journey.And of course, the plot isn't the only thing to praise with this film. Tarantino's directing skills are, as always, superb. Uma Thurman was superb, and David Carradine gives an almost mythical performance as Bill. The supporting cast was excellent as well (particuarlly Madsen and Liu). Tarentino has always been known for being able to combine music and scenes memorably, and Kill Bill is no exception, with the score lending itself to the film perfectly.While it still possesses the style and action of it's predecessor, Kill Bill Volume 2 sets itself apart with it's deep and emotion filled story. No other director could have made this film, and Tarantino shows why he's revered as one of today's greatest directors. By paying homage to the his influences and heroes, Tarantino has created a classic.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

I left seriously let down, as did many of the people I talked to after the movie was over while we were walking out of the theater. I walked into the movie theater, sat down in the front, and slunk all the way back in my chair and got ready to watch the movie. Only one scene in the whole movie made me sit up. One section of the movie looked, felt, and sounded like it was ripped DIRECTLY from the pages of an old, terrible Kung-Fu movie. Complete with an old super powerful fool who hates Americans, women, and blondes (yet agrees to train The Bride, who is all three), has an obscene infatuation with stroking his 5 foot beard, and can do the same 'jump and balance myself on the sword on one foot' trick that Chow-Yun Fat did in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

577,ez-xbox,A fantastic brought-out revenge story,10,15 March 2016,"All the tags we needed to know that it would be great watching this was: Quentin Tarantino, Katana fights, Uma Thurman, and Michael Madsen. Never has a movie with so much brutality and cruelty made me look away. In this movie, the violence is very mild and unseen compared to the last one, but in ways I liked that more. It allowed for more character development, conflict, and backstory, and it revealed such sentimental things, such as Beatrix seeing her - not aware that that she was alive- daughter.And you all know the challenged woman who was with quentin Tarantino on the air and talking about his supposedly ""SOULESS"" movie.Um, yeah no. It actually has a soul. A lot of it. The soul in many religions, philosophical and mythological traditions, is the incorporeal and immortal essence of a living being. According to Abrahamic religions, only human beings have immortal souls. This describes most the characters perfectly. We see that they have souls even if they caused Uma Thurman to be in a coma. *cough Pulp Fiction overdose scene*.And the fact that is is directed by one of the most stylistic and thought provoking director makes it the more beautiful. This movie also had an amazing soundtrack that fit the movie so well. Every scene that had a soundtrack was amazing. The final scenes soundtrack was probably the best. Which brings me the only issues, the scene was stretched a little to much.So in the end, this film was successful in almost every way.

It contains a lot of emotion, agony, thrill, melancholy and feeling of justice and vengeance. It is definitely the best fighting movie ever. Ennio Morricone soundtracks were perfect. I admire Robert Rodriguez and RZA a lot. Itis the first time Tarantino uses Morricone music, children to play in the movie,katana swords. I loved the idea of using sword. It is actually a film with a lot of martial arts, chapters, revenge, violence & love and it has no sex scenes which is very important for the movie. The Bride is not a woman for sex.

579,greenfarfan,The Bride is back!,10,10 November 2016,"If you watched Kill Bill: Vol. 1, then you practically have to see Kill Bill: Vol. 2 because it's no ordinary movie sequel. In fact, it is more of a continuation to an unfinished movie. Where the first Kill Bill film had chapters 1-5, the second film contains chapters 6-10. And by watching Kill Bill Vol. 2, you get any unanswered questions Volume 1 had. The second half of Tarantino's 4th film will essentially give satisfaction to its viewers. Volume 1 was the more action- packed/exhilarating part, in which Volume 2 is the more drama-filled/emotional part. However, it is better not to think of Kill Bill as two separate parts because when it comes down to it, Volumes 1 & 2 are just a means of presenting this film into two halves. In the end, Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill should be considered as one long, epic, martial arts, revenge-film. So if you liked Vol. 1, Vol. 2 is a must-see.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

The story is boring,  the fighting scenes are crap, the martial arts of all characters pathetic, the camera was well done, so the movie looks cool and the soundtrack is ok too, but that does not justify a high rating. I was really bored watching this movie. I disliked the gore of the first movie but I loved the sceneries, in this one I was just bored. Btw I was really surprised David Carradine was not as bad as he usually is. I personally like Thurman, but she should stay away from ""Kung Fu"". She is way better in movies like Gattaca and Beautiful Girls. I would gave the first a 7/10 max, this one a 5/10. Do not waste your money only because the is movie from Mister T.

582,drakken71,Great conclusion,10,25 October 2004,"To me, when a movie audience either hates or loves a movie, that's a good indication that the movie probably is a masterpiece.In Kill Bill you probably don't have a middle section, either you will love it or hate it.Back in the 70s, after the legendary Bruce Lee's death, there was a boom on Chinese kung-fu films, fast action, full of violence and Bruce Lee's wannabes, they were the main juice on oriental movie theaters.Kill Bill captures this time.. and then.... so much more. Its a ""70's Chinese kung fu movie"", a ""Kurosawa classic"", a ""spaghetti western"" re-visited, a ""Manga cartoon""... all that wrapped up in a fast-paced action movie, very well directed with superb soundtrack and magnificent fighting sequences.I must say that this is the best movie Quentin made since the classic ""Pulp Fiction"". Some people won't understand it, others won't stand it, but many will love it, cause its one of those movies made with such good taste and so many subtle details, that will soon become a classic.The cast was carefully selected, only ""Uma Thurman"" could play ""Black Mamba"" in such a way. She's fragile and deadly, innocent and ruthless at the same time. Uma always had that flexibility in all of her movies, and Kill Bill is no exception.Sonny Chiba as ""Hatori Hanzo"" is perfect, the dialogue between him and Uma is one of the most memorial moments in movie history. He's the perfect samurai, a humble barman and yet the best blacksmith in Okinawa.Beautiful Lucy Liu delivers one of her best performances (the Japanese garden scene is one to be remembered forever, Darryl Hannah makes a unique and great comeback (and looks hot in nurse uniform), Michael Madsen usual is icy and subtle as a rattlesnake and ""Kung-Fu TV classic"" series David Carradine is perfect as the cool, mature and deadly ""Bill"".To review Kill Bill part 1 and 2 separately is a mistake, both are only 1 movie and should be watched one after the other (same goes for Lord of the Rings trilogy, in my opinion).Just as Kubrik and Polanski, Tarantino is the master of one thing, ATMOSPHERE.... you really get sucked into his creations, forgetting real life for a moment and live a unique experience.Thumb's up to one of the best directors of our time.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
583,tkcadmaan,An Epic Action Movie,8,20 December 2019,"Tarantino treats both volumes of Kill Bill as a single movie, and I feel that is true. At first I thought that perhaps the director took too long to arrange certain scenes, but that is most certainly not the case. Tarantino made sure to give each portion of the story the perfect amount of time that it deserved, and it was wonderful! Lots of action, lots of blood, lots of cliches, but in all the right ways. The first volume in my opinion is the better of the two, and is crucial for understanding the story, so I recommend watching the first volume before this one, or else you would have missed out on a lot of important plot points, even though this movie tries to have a kind of recap at the start. Overall a great action movie with great performances and amazing cinematography and set design, a must see for lovers of Tarantino's work!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

586,megaG,Tarantino at his... worst?,3,3 May 2004,"Considering how much i enjoy tarantino films... including Kill Bill vol. 1 - i was so very much looking forward to the release of vol. 2. Little did i realise that when Kill Bill was cut up into 2 volumes.... that it was literally cut up into 2 volumes. The first which offered a rich textured, comical and action packed experience was followed up with a 2nd half which is meant to be perhaps thought provoking.However it isnt pulled off well. Tarantino's ironic portrayal of the first movie is taken to a really bad extreme in the second film where not a lot happens, and then the film is wrapped up in about 10 minutes when Bill is confronted at last - and then dies in a matter of seconds with no sword fight, but instead a rediculous sequence of gestures....If you havent seen the film yet and are reading this review... you may probably think *wtf?* - well thats exactly what i thought when i saw the film. A gross disappointment considering the writer and the prequel.Thumbs Down",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
587,jimmyfuct,"an equally good sequel, albeit not as memorable",9,28 October 2021,"I wasn't expecting ""Kill Bill: Vol. 2"" to be a worthy sequel; quite frankly, I expected it to be a mediocre follow-up to the awesome, ""Volume 1"". As I normally am, I WAS DEAD WRONG. This sequel managed to live up to the sequel without failing to add some twists and surprises along the way. As you probably heard, this sequel is WAY less violent than the first. Don't get me wrong, it still has violence, just not nearly as much as the the first one. But in my opinion, this makes the movie more grounded and I can understand the characters and the villain(In this case, Bill's) motives a bit better. Beatrix Kiddo is halfway through on her hit-list, only Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), Budd (Michael Madsen), and finally, yep, you guessed it, Bill (David Carradine) remain. It is sad indeed that David Carradine passed. His role was and still is excellent! Now, when Beatrix, or The Bride goes to eliminate Budd, she sadly gets tricked by Budd and gets shot. Then, she gets buried alive in a nailed-down coffin. We then travel back to the past, when Bill and Beatrix are camping, when Bill decides to take Beatrix to Pai Mei for training. At first, Beatrix gets scorned by Pai Mei, but eventually starts to respect her slowly. I really like the training scenes for this reason: say Tarantino DIDN'T show us this scene(s). We'd just see The Bride do the Exploding Heart Technique and leave many unanswered questions. Of course, I also have to mention the fight scene between Driver and Kiddo. This scene is one of the best scenes out of the two movies and is my second-favorite scene in ""Volume 2"". It has perfectly quotable lines ""I called him a miserable, old fool"" and ""B*tch, you don't have a future"". Also, the final scene with Bill and Kiddo deserves a special mention. With even more memorable lines and a memorable villain death, it might hold up as one of the greatest, ever. Overall, this sequel is very good, but not as memorable. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
588,Captain-America,kiss the bride,10,15 April 2004,"i've just seen ""kill bill vol. 2"" in an advanced screening and all i can say is: WOW! after the bloodfest of vol. 1 the second part is much more the ""old"" tarantino, more story, more dialogue. still, there's room enough for action. the fight between the bride and elle driver (daryl hannah) is wild. makes the little argument between the bride and vivica a. fox's character look like child's play. after only a small appearance in vol. 1 david carradine now owns the picture. he has such a strong presence, is so cool, that all i could think was: why, oh why didn't he make more and better movies. uma thurman has never looked more radiant or more gorgeous (except of course in vol. 1) and there is no doubt in my mind that tarantino totally has a cruch on her. ""kill bill"" in its entirety is nothing but a love letter to uma - and who can blame quentin?I have yet to see vol. 1 + 2 back to back, so i'm not sure how well they play together. but taken for themselves they are two of the most exciting cinematic expreiences i've ever had.Oh, and by the way, wait till the end of the credits. you'll be rewarded with a little extra something.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Insanity.,1,20 December 2010,"Since I believe this ""movie"" should be avoided at all cost as a major waste of your time there's no need to give any summary. Although what is worth mentioning is how ridiculously boring, tedious, and pointless this so-called movie really is. I just finished watching Kill Bill vol. 2 and I am in a state of disbelief over how anybody could find this movie entertaining. Somebody please tell me the appeal of near endless, mindless dialog with a great deal of it being completely pointless. Anti-entertaining is the best way I can think of to describe it. I was looking for a little entertaining while laying on my bed home from work sick with the flu, but this ""movie"" isn't just a disappointment because its not entertaining, it goes beyond that to induce an actual level of misery. Bad movies simply are not entertaining, thus this movie is worse than bad. Its so over-the-top pointless, and don't get me wrong there is about 20 solid minutes altogether of at least SOMETHING worth watching. But its so outweighed by the vast majority of unnerving nothing-ness that is the rest... well just picture an elephant and a feather on opposing ends of a balancing weight scale. The dialog is so bad you would be better off sitting in the park listening to two strangers converse about anything thats not kill bill 2, then to subject yourself to the torture that is kill bills (a good movie) sequel. I'm a big fan of Quentin Tarantino and I gave this movie every benefit of the doubt all the way to the very end but it just kept getting worse. I thought maybe the ""movie"" was building to a big amazing climax at the end since the whole thing was so slow and agonizingly boring.. But NOPE! the so-called climax of this film is the most boring, tedious, monotonous, painful 30 minutes or so of the whole ""movie,"" maybe even film history all things considered. I read all these reviews of people saying what a masterpiece this film is. To each their own.. but that must be some kind of mass organized joke. No real sustained action period. Any fragments of what little action there is is outweighed a million-to-one by intense blaring boredom. Plot is irrelevant because before the you even hit ""play"" its already known -Kill Bill. No real flow considering all the wacky pointless scenes with no bearing on the story at all. These pointless scenes can't have even one positive adjective attached to them, for example ""funny"" or ""suspenseful"" They are just nothing. Forgive my poor grammar in this review, it was typed quickly during a moment of passion, immediately following my first -and very much last- viewing of Kill Bill 2.Mindless talk-talk-talk-talk-talk-talk-talk-talk about nothing going nowhere with no point, forever is the legacy of Kill Bill vol. 2.

590,frankyep,He delivers and he scores!,10,3 October 2004,"In Kill Bill: Volume 1, we as an audience were thrilled to see the return of Quentin Tarantino and this magnificent artwork. Now as he continues with this Vol. 2, it seems that this one slightly outranks its predecessor. This film is absolutely brilliant for one reason because of the diolague. Because Tarantino tones down the excessive violence that was featured in Vol. 1, we can focus more on the characters and the powerful diolague from his magnificent screenplay. Also, though Uma Thurman is still dominate, the supporting characters are good as well. Such as Budd who almost plays a reformed sinner and Elle who is a sinister person and has the greatest scene in the entire movie, a showdown between her and the Bride in Budd's trailer. But one of the greatest characters is of course BILL. David Carradine is so brilliant in this role that the character seems to come alive. Through watching him, we have this feeling that even though he presents himself as a simple human being, through his actions we can see he is really a sick and sadistic person. My only complaint is that Michael Parks seems to try too hard to play a Mexican and get a thick Spanish accent than try to work on his lines. But still, this is an excellent film, a true delight and one that should surely not be missed. (***1/2)A-",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Part 2 has most of the background story.  After seeing Vol2, you'll appreciate the first movie that much more.  The only complaint I've heard about volume 2 is that one friend thinks the redneck alcoholic Bud made too good of a showing in his fight with Kiddo.  I think this just let you know that while the Black Mamba is a great fighter, she also isnt invincible.  I've talked to many people and if you liked Pulp Fiction, then Kill Bill is for you.  I'd say its one of Tarrantino's best. Volume2 lets you know that the ""Kill Bill"" story is more than over-the-top anime' style killing.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
592,rosanna_rosannadanna,Tarantino rips off someone new,1,23 March 2006,"I don't know why people think Quentin Tarantino is good when all he does is rip off other people. Everything in Kill Bill 1 and 2 came from Hong Kong cinema, including Uma Thurman's track suit and shoes. The closest he ever came to an original movie was Jackie Brown-at least in that case he was making a movie from a book rather than copying someone else's work shot-for-shot and passing it off as his own. I used to like his work and thought Pulp Fiction was one of the best movies I'd seen when I saw it. Ironically I was going to school in England when it came out, back when Hong Kong was owned by the Brits. It was pretty weird to walk out of a theater thinking I'd just seen something great only to hear people in front of rattling off the movies that; the Walken scene came from, Bruce Willis character, and the whole Eric Stoltz/Uma Thurman/John Travolta storyline. Plagiarism like his doesn't deserve to be rewarded.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
593,ARRUHbeast,not as good as vol 1,5,23 April 2004,"me being a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino I was looking forward to seeing Kill Bill vol 1. It was great. Not one of his best, but still great. Now I've been anticipating vol 2 for months after it was delayed to april. It goes straight into the action, with a little introduction at the wedding, this being the first time I'd seen Bill's face. Generally this isn't as violent as vol 1, apart from one scene when the Bride is fighting Elle, but their is much more of a story. Vol 2 concentrates more on the love story between Bill and the Bride (whose name you also find out)and also you see where the Bride got all of her skills (the Pai Mei scene is very good). I was a bit dissapointed with the ending (though I'm sure we all know what happens at the end)I thought it could have happened a bit better, and Bill compares the Bride to Superman, which is just plain strange, but that's Tarantino for you. A bit of dissapointment after vol 1, but still a good film with some generally good scenes in it but not one Tarantino's best.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
594,Robin-chan,A fine addition to Vol. 1,9,11 March 2005,"As an avid fan of Kill Bill: Vol. 1, I was almost frightened to actually sit down and watch Vol. 2, not knowing what to expect. Now, I'm thrilled that I did.Kill Bill 2 focuses more on The Bride's past, answering every question you may have had in Vol. 1: Who is Bill? What happened that day of the wedding? What's up with Elle? Who is Budd? What happened to the daughter? All of this and more is answered in Vol. 2, with twists and turns galore.Let me say first off that this movie is hardly like the first -- but that's in a good way. The spiffy blood and guts and martial arts effects are no more, instead replaced with deep-rooted psychological plot points and expecting the unexpected. It lacks the kick-in-the-mouth, spontaneous martial arts scenes from the first one, and is replaced by a slow abundance of dialogue that starts the movie off on what could be mistaken for the wrong foot. But after a while, the action starts, and we're quickly drawn into a wild goose chase following The Bride -- now known as Beatrix Kiddo -- and her mad chase after Bill and all of her remaining opponents. Stories are told, questions are answered, and everything that you may predict to happen will not happen, which puts back the spontaneous plot points that we know and love. The movie is an unpredictable, wild ride that ends with a heartfelt, nicely done conclusion that wraps it all up very well.I don't expect a Kill Bill 3; on the contrary, I think I'd be rather disappointed by one, but we'll see what happens. However, the first two volumes go perfectly hand-in-hand, and you will not be disappointed by either one. 9/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
595,NMcKenzie,liked vol I? get excited...didn't see it? rent it and see what it's all about..,10,17 April 2004,"If you like the first one, then I don't really have to convince you, these two movies are a one-TWO, and they saved the best for last, that is if you have the ability to leave some of the reality at the door. I'm not saying they are stretch to the extent of ""The Matrix"" or anything like that, but they are dont creatively to give a new spin on things old. What movie with a killing in it wasn't based upon revenge? But how many of those movies are as innovative and while some say ""that's stupid and unrealistic"", well that's the point, you kill someone you go to jail in real life...it's a movie.... But back to the main point, if you didn't I commented on the first volume which recieved fair marks on here as well, but I think before you see the second that this second installment could not possibly be as good. Its defintely visually pleasing, and the sound is great (both effects and music). Along with that, it plays off some of the things in the first movie but gives the (note the quotes for modesty)""saga"" more depth..ie the chapel massacre. In any case, I loved it and I think that I liked it more than the first one. To be fair I am biased and ran out and bought the first one; so, I suggest, rent the first volume, if you can't buy into it then dont waste your time on the second. However, if you liked it in the least, get excited for volume two because it is just a great ending to the story. Also, I have to note, I was incredibly impressed with the actor's, whose name I'm not sure of now, performance. I think that Uma Thurman was a good cast for the main role, but the casting of Bill's part couldn't have been better. At any rate, I hope that even though I didn't elaborate much on the plot, the fact that I am so excited about this movies gets SOME people out and turned on to the ""Kill Bill"" stories.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
596,lastamericanliberal,He's batting four for five....,8,25 May 2004,"Breathtaking film experience. No one matches the intensity and wit of Quentin's dialogue. The story is original, and the emotional turbulence the characters each go through are brilliantly portrayed, especially by Carradine, Madsen, and Uma. The training scene with The Bride in Asia serves as some type of emotional and intellectual barometer; if you aren't involved in a rally cry for her at that point, your probably not paying attention or dead. I also love how The Bride has a punk-rock, do it yourself attitude; what drew me to the first film (aside from the directing credit) was how she didn't go to a man for help, she was going to Kill Bill herself. I don't remember a film where the heroine was actually showing independent bravado, at least not a film that was worth the price of admission.Darryl Hannah is wickedly over the top, just so that she's entertaining. David Carradine plays the villain that you hate the most: A character who is likable, even admirable by ever account, as long as you don't have knowledge of his actions or motives. Michael Madsen's performance shines brightest, residing in the vacant shadow of the thoughts of who he used to be, remorsefully determined. Uma plays The Bride better than any other actress could have, and better than most actors could play a character with such intents. And absolute must see, ranking above Resorvior Dogs and near Pulp Fiction on his ""So Far"" list.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
597,iammadeofcheese,"Bill gets killed, uma's looming, madsen is got fat-sen and darryl hannah is definitely not hot anymore",10,11 August 2004,"As is the case with most directors whose careers, albeit short or long, have seen sharp peaks and abysmal valleys, Tarantino has made his definitive statement with a film that is a far cry in quality from his previous accomplishments. Undoubtedly, his two best films were the first two: PF and RD. Though KB(s 1 'n 2) may be (2) big step(s) (for moviekind) up from the disappointment (yeah, I said it) of the purportedly emotionally mature (*ha*) ""Jackie Brown"", it's laughable to me that similar qualities have been ascribed to the KB film. This movie is terrific...don't get me wrong! It's unabashedly fun fun fun entertainment...but it's campy...""what is that supposed to mean?"" That a little polish and esoteric nods/bites here or there can pass off for style, and the true charm of this movie is the moving, BAFTA-nominated performance of the ""great"" actress Uma Thurman? Me thinks not. Her spirited performance in ""Even Cowgirls Get the Blues"" did little to assuage the general public's belief that she is selective in her film appearances by choice. She's not F. Murray Abraham, or anything - she's Mia Wallace. KB is a comic-book movie, and its actors are about as under-the-top as Alfred Molina in Spider-Man 2 (a bad, but fitting performance for the definitive comic book movie.) After all, Kill Bill, Vol. 2 might just be the definitive comic book movie to never have been based on a comic book. It's got all the fixins. Tarantino is an American filmmaker - his ""knowledge"" of the techniques utilized in foreign films is not nearly as extensive as the number of films he has watched. Upon seeing his work, a neophyte might make such observations. He loves the moving image. The ""neat"", ""cool-looking"" things he can do with a camera, or in post-production. The camera eye, studying arbitrary qualities of a room. He likes talking heads - he likes to hear himself pontificate endlessly about popular culture. He seems to have an obsession with feet. In KB, Vol. 2, he has fallen into self-parody, but it's brilliant. Tarantino has come into his own: he can use the aforementioned bastardized strains of Eurasian film-philosophy to create a moving comic book, tongue-in-cheek references to the film-styles he loves (simply because, after seeing all of his directorial efforts, it seems that Tarantino's sole wish as a filmmaker is to keep alive dead styles of film-making) and, for once, a film that is so inconsistent in style, that it functions as a continuous, running joke completely detached from the proceedings of the film. Of course, part of the reason we love Tarantino so much is that he is the frontrunner of his whole style over substance movement...""it's a good thing."" It's a little disconcerting to read a Tarantino script that is devoid of humor. There are far too many straight lines in KB2 (however, not as many as in KB1 - however nothing as funny as: ""I beseech you on behalf of my daughter."") The acting is another problem. Uma Thurman, as I mentioned before, gets by on attitude on her physical presence. Michael Madsen is a convincing sadistic hick - but I think I liked him more as a sadistic gangster in Reservoir Dogs...of course, Tarantino also has the unique distinction of being an anomaly of sorts when it comes to working with actors. On the one hand: outside of their work with Tarantino, Samuel L. Jackson, Uma Thurman, John Travolta, Bridget Fonda, Harvey Keitel, [Madsen], Chris Penn and Pam Grier (and god only knows who else) have delivered nothing but lame-as-lame could ever hope or wish to be perfunct performances with other directors at the helm. One the other hand: he managed to direct Robert DeNiro (one of the greatest actors of all time) to a performance that would rank amongst his 1990s worst. Darryl Hannah is definitely not sexy anymore and (judging by this performance) was never a good actor. Her best performance was, most likely, in Blade Runner (where she plays a robot.) Carradine steals every scene he's in with his creepy presence and menacing lisp. This is an exciting, scary, high-octane adventure/revenge flick with a genuinely crowd-pleasing ending and exploding eyeballs. 'Nuff said. C",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

I mean he picks people out who have been stereotyped, branded, whatever, to play parts in his movies and they always turn out to be fantastic! Watch these movies! These movies are perfect! You'll come out to say, "" I want to watch this again!"" I believe soundtracks are just as important to movies as anything is, these movies are perfectly tuned to music a they are to action!

So naturally kill Bill vol.2 should be as good if not better, but sadly its not. I got very excited at the prospect of seeing this film especially with the trailers and the tag line: two down three to go. To me however, although at first it was all meant to be one film, Mr Tarantino seemed to rush this movie. some of the fight scenes where lacking and looked sloppy and the simple story and plot took a nose dive into the ridiculous. I found myself regretting seeing this movie and wishing i had let the sequel stay in my imagination. This is the only film in my eyes of Quentin Tarantino's that is bad to watch. this film is a mere shadow of what he can do.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
600,Citizen_J10,Fresh in its absurdity but nowhere near a masterpiece status,7,11 February 2007,"This volume is a lot different from the first one but it wouldn't necessarily have to be a bad thing. While the first one was all about style and little substance, this one tries to be a little more deeper in meaning. Unfortunately, the serious drama side isn't as convincing and successful as the light and stylish fighting side is in these movies.The film is divided in five different chapters. Whereas the first volume was more or less linear in its storytelling, this time around the chapters are much more disjointed from each other. The flashbacks don't fit into the flow of the movie smoothly. The plot in itself is a very simple revenge story and I guess what most consider the main treats in the movie are the dialogue and the explosive albeit short action sequences. Well, the dialogue isn't the most typical one you hear in movies but it also often feels forced. The plot is full of absurd moments and sometimes those moments feel a little too self-pretentious.The use of music, the absurd plot and some over the top characters...it's all intriguing to watch but it still is mainly just eye-candy. The substance in the story just isn't there. Even though this volume spends much more time evolving Uma Thurman's character it actually is a disservice to the film because I don't feel related to the character any more than in the beginning of the movie, as a matter of fact the exact opposite. The pain was much more touching in the first volume. In this volume many scenes are too long and and serve little purpose to actually explain the motives of main characters. The dialogue is supposed to be witty, I guess, but mostly it is either too simple and repetitive or tries to be funny a little too obviously.I'm not saying the movie is completely bad, far from it. The style of the movie is still fascinating and the basic plot is OK in all its simplicity. Some of the acting is excellent (Carradine as Bill and Madsen as Budd especially) although Thurman's character loses a lot of its appeal. It might be due to some odd writing (the sequence where she's meeting Pai Mei is not very convincing) or due to Thurman's little one-sided facial expressions. Anyhow, this movie is something you should see just for the sake of it.This movie comes down to personal preferences like all movies of course. If the often absurd plot and dialogue amuses you a lot and the small lack of substance or coherent storytelling doesn't bother you you might just love the movie for its cool style. The first volume was cool in its style and this has some of the same characteristics. However, the slow pace and the emphasis on the drama side isn't working as well as it should if you call this one of the best movies of all time. This is a nice experiment and in many ways you can see how Tarantino has had some fun adding funny little sequences and things here and there but in the end the movie as a whole isn't coherent or deep, it's just a fun montage of more or less cool and sometimes naive things and tricks.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
601,jimthechin,What did i do to deserve this?,1,8 April 2005,"The movie-making career of Quentin Tarantino takes a turn for the worse following this pointless film. With successes like Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction under his belt it's a wonder he didn't choose to retire a respected genius rather than filling our lives with this emptiness called Vol. 2. (It was actually called Vol. 2) Maybe it should be called Void 2 as when you try telling someone what this film was about you find yourself wondering more about what important knowledge was pushed aside in your brain for this inflated garbage to fill. OK enough of the initial insults (we'll come back to those) and on to the main points about why this is really bad. Firstly the story is a woman who kills people in revenge for her friend's own killings. There is nothing more about it to note and to be honest a donkey could understand what's happening. Usually these films get by on the sheer amount of violence, gore and special effects (eye candy). This however appeared to be an attempt at making a proper film. He failed. The violence was not there, but to replace it was a mere collection of flash-backs, undeveloped characters and uninventive killings diluted by a slow script where it seemed to take an age for a sentence to be completed. Maybe they made it through two-thirds of the script in the first one and had to tell the cast to talk slower or they wouldn't have a 'Vol.2'. The clip-show lasted two and a half hours and after about 90 minutes I was looking to my watch hoping for it to end soon (only to be bitterly disappointed). By the time 'Bill' started giving his superman speech I couldn't bear to listen because to be honest I really didn't care about Tarantino's comic-book revelations. In fact I'd heard that speech before somewhere like a lot of this film. One bit that had me amused was the part with the Chinese 'master' in martial arts who instructed whatever the main character was called (it just didn't seem important enough to know this in the grand story-line). Once again his character was a copy from another film but that didn't matter much as the OTT sword-fighting skills and silly beard stroking were enough even to make me laugh. It was a mere interlude before the exhausting second half. It drew to a close with a ridiculous fighting move that requires five steps for its death-inducing effect to kick in. I almost laughed at this but felt inclined to spare anyone caught up in this 'emotional moment'. The attempt to round up the film with an emotional ending was unbearable to watch and I didn't feel for her at all or bother to waste the energy to smile. The acting wasn't bad, which is some consolation for one of the worst and over-rated movies in recent times. To slate this film was to reboot my brain.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

It was cinematographically inventive - eg the animated sequence. It had visually arresting and impressively choreographed fight scenes. And it had dark humour in the dialogue. So when I saw that Volume 2 was showing, I thought I was in for an entertaining couple of hours. I was wrong.There was none of the stylishness. Shooting one chapter in monochrome does not make for an interesting technique. The dialogue showed only brief flashes of the dark humour that leavened Volume 1, but for the most part was stodgy and leaden. As others have commented, quite a few of the scenes served no purpose whatsoever - they were not entertaining, they did not develop the characters, they did not advance the plot.As for the fight scenes - well, there were none. At least, none of the impressive ensemble scenes from the first volume. There were just two fights in the whole two hours. The first, with Elle, was not even a fight to the death, although I admit I did find the resolution of that one OK. But it was short and decidedly lacking in actual fighting.The second, the final climactic confrontation with Bill, must be a contender for the biggest anti-climax in cinema history. It lasted a matter of seconds, and was resolved by a bit of mystical mojo. And to get there we had to sit through about half an hour of the Bride and Bill playing Happy Families and then reminiscing about what went wrong in their relationship.Others have commented on the inherent misogyny in these films. I didn't get that with Volume 1 - it was too ""cartoony"" for that. It came through very much in Volume 2. Lingering shots of the Bride panting in agony or terror. Bud and his friend salivating over how they were going to kill her. And the ultimate in the idea of a wrinkly ancient like Bill with a young beauty like the Bride.But the film's bigger sin was in being boring. Several times I found myself reaching for the remote to fast forward. It just could not hold the interest.It is not the worst film ever. That honour is reserved for 2001 - A Space Odyssey. Now that is two hours of my life that I really want back.

It demonstrates how in-charge QT is over the movie-medium, how well he can handle all the little genre-trademarks of kung-fu and spaghetti-western movies, and just how deliriously beautiful he can be when he is the master of the universe (at least the ""Kill Bill"" universe).This movie more than shows the beauty of film when directors have full control.I loved it!10/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Unfortunately, I'm more of book person, myself.While I love a decent and mindless action flick, that wasn't ALL I was expecting from Tarantino in these movies. I admired the lofty dialogue that Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction bared, but that suddenly disappeared. In fact, it was replaced with overpoweringly cheesy dialogue! What happened? I will admit, however, a very admirable conversation between Bill and B about Superman had me thinking, ""Wow, cool stuff."" As far as I can see, this film does a great job of capturing the majority of mindless audiences out there, which is probably why more people actually care about his previous films. Because, good lord, it's cool to like QT now! And while capturing such an audience and gaining that can of recognition CAN be considered an achievement, somewhat, a movie with all style and NO substance is a B movie, period.No amount of guide-wire flipping or blood-spray can change the fact that this movie is a pretty cheap attempt to gain an audience.

""The Totally Recalled Passion of Bill""?  Wouldn't that be wonderful and uplifting!  How is this for a clever idea for your next film: a shootout in the world's largest mannequin factory!  Imagine the irony of the utterly empty body count!  Wait, has this been done before?  Oh, yes.  Kill Bill: Vol. 1 and nearly every other movie you've ever done!

You won't find references to Star Wars and Lord of the Rings here - you'll have to watch The Magic Roundabout for that. But it is a wonderful homage to David Carrafine's kung fu. It seems the film was written for him but there are brilliant performances from all the leads. ""I must warn you young lady that I am susceptible to flattery"" is delivered with dripping lasciviousness. The characters are alternative in my book - witness the assassin who meekly obeys a tart and the child who goes to sleep watching murder movies. They all create tensions, right, left and centre that are suddenly released in an almost unclimactic way. Twice as good as KB1 but couldn't have been, without it.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

613,compactDiSc,One of the best sequel of all time.,10,16 May 2007,"Kill Bill Volume 2 has to be in the sentence with Aliens, Terminator 2, Evil Dead, and The Godfather Part II. this has to be one of the greatest sequels of all time. Quentin Tarantino hits it out of the park with his great storytelling, especially his dialogue.The movie begins with a flashback of the wedding rehearsal. This is the first time we see Bill, who was wonderfully played by Bill Carradine. In volume 1 we only saw actually never saw his face.This just as Pulp Fiction is a movie full of homages, from spaghetti westerns to giallo films. I see this movie more as an spaghetti western more than anything else. First, the music which was full of Ennio Morricone, it felt like the Dollars Trilogy all over again.Just like any Quentin Tarantino film this movie has great acting, great dialogue, and great storytelling. My favorite piece of dialogue was the ""Superman"" speech by Bill.I rate this film 4/4.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
614,azrael41,Vol 2. is to story what Vol. 1 is to Style,10,11 October 2004,"Here we have a ""continuation"" of one of the most perplexing, stylistic, mystifying, and action packed movie experiences ever put on film. I had no idea what to expect walking into the theatre to view Kill Bill Vol. 2. The first film was clever, wrought with Tarantinian logic and style, unspeakably violent, and one hell of a good time. But I couldn't watch vol. 1 without the sinking feeling that there was almost literally no story involved. Tarantino made a film which seemed to exist so that he would have an excuse to recreate shots from his favorite kung-fu films, single handedly support the ""movie blood"" industry, and coordinate breath taking a beautiful fight sequences. It moved at a break neck pace which left no time for character development or conflict. I feared that Vol 2. would make the mistake of attempting to maintain this pacing.My worries, however, proved to be unfounded. Instead, Tarantino's second installment tones down the miraculous action sequences(but does not eliminate them) so that we can pay more attention to why things are happening, and what is driving these characters to do what they do. There are feasts for the eyes and the ears. This film is largely more influenced by the Spaghetti Westerns and Sergio Leone than the first. Robert Rodruigez and the Rza provide great throwback music which the director perfectly mates with his images. However, Vol. 2 finds its greatest asset in the character of Bill, portrayed by David Carodine in the most surprising performance of this or any year.It is important to note, when watching either film, that neither is complete unless viewed with the other in mind. This is a single film, written, acted, and photographed at the same time. The decision to split the film apart came in post-production, and to consider it as two separate films is to do an injustice to the much greater work as a whole. This film is the key to all genre film-making. The filmmaker has created a work in which a frame from any of its influences could easily find a home within the reels of his movie. This goes beyond the similar aspirations of Raiders of the Lost Arc, Star Wars, and Silverado, among others, to prove itself not only a great movie, but another piece of film making genius by Quintin Tarantino.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
615,Kaarmah,Not at all what i expected,7,16 August 2004,"I've decided to make this a review for both volume 1 & 2, simply because I'm too lazy to write two.Every time you see a Tarantino film you know it's going to be original and clever and that's exactly what i expected from Kill Bill. Well it certainly had the originality but it's the cleverness that made movies like ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Reservoir Dogs"" so great that this one lacks.Especially in Volume 1 it seems as if they are trying to hide the quite dull and uninteresting story behind lots of gore and ""cool"" effects and sure they've done a good job because it seems to have fooled the majority of movie goers.Volume 2 was a bit better, it seemed more mature and intelligent than the first one and this is much thanks to some great acting especially from Uma Thurman who gives us a very believable and human assassin.    I often found that the only reason why I kept watching was due to Thurman's acting and i certainly hope we're going to get to see a lot of her from now on.Kill Bill isn't a bad movie, it does have it's bright moments and some very interesting characters but it isn't a ""top 250-movie"" either mainly because it just tries a bit too hard and sometimes it can actually get kind of boring which i thought would be impossible in a Quentin Tarantino Film.I'll give Kill Bill vol. 1 & 2 7/10 stars for some great characters and acting but a not so great story.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

So when I bought advance tickets to see the second volume of Kill Bill, getting to the theatre an hour early, getting incredible seats, I was ready for KBv2 on opening night.Sadly, I was disappointed.  I felt terrible for not liking a movie made by my hero, and, in liu of the message boards, shared the same sentiment as others.""There was too much dialogue, there wasn't enough action.  Sure the acting was awesome, but the 'anti-climactic ending' left it in vain.""But that was Friday.  When invited to see it again on Sunday, I felt I owed it to QT to see this film again.  Besides, the first time I saw Reservoir Dogs I hated it, saw it again, and loved it.  It turned out to be the best decision I made all year.  I mean WOW!  I must have fallen asleep because everything in this film was AWESOME!!  The action, the humor, the dialogue, the ending, the acting, the cinematography.  EVERYTHING ~! People are arguing which volume was best, but it's all one film,  so just think of it as such.  It's Quentin's masterpiece.Nearly 4 hours of WOW.So I beg to all of the haters of KBv2 to give it another shot.  It changed me and my views.  Go QT!!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
617,ScottLabrecque,Pretty good...............,7,18 April 2004,"Pretty good, but not the end-all/be-all film by Tarantino. I'd rather have had this movie as ONE movie, not two, as the second half drops the ball, changes direction, becoming an action shadow of Volume 1.Volume one contained ""the action movie"", and did so exceedingly well.Volume two contained the ""slower emotional side of the movie"", which I thought it failed at frequently, and telegraphed the future plot complications too early, unlike the first volume's fight scenes, where you had no idea what they were going to do next.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Quentin Tarantino's story is great in every aspect and with this last movie confirms all the things that I ever thought about him and that's the fact that he is one of the best directors of the world ever. I had seen all of his movies and definitely this is the best of all. Kill Bill is creative, beautiful, refreshing and above all spectacular! The idea of splitting the movie in half was brilliant and really makes you be impatient to see what's going happened next.

Walking out satisfy Kill Bill had quench these desires and more.  It was nice to see that the sequel stay to its campy theme yet at the same time it was also refreshing to see QT usage of different movie style for each subplot.  Although it does not have as much action as in Kill Bill 1, the thickened plot more than makes up for this void.  Don't be surprise to witnessing something entirely different from the first movie.

What killed it for me was that it seemed that everyone was the typical villain and it was way to drawn out. Like David caradine always explaining his motive, or the long shots of just movement of the characters. Some times the acting even seems a little campy and I am not talking about the kung fu master. Like the part where shes driving in black n white and talking to the camera, or the guy getting chewed out by his strip club boss.all in all I should have waited and rented this movie.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

I loved it as much as the first volume though! Just wanna point out that both films would be even better if they were combined from the beginning...the dialogue-heavy second part would be balanced by the thrilling first part, making a more complete film...I don't want to spoil the fun for you so I won't say what you should expect of that movie...but it surely makes the whole Kill Bill saga a complete saga...10 out of 10.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

The buildup, so well done in Tarantino's later movies like ""Inglorious Bastards"", was poorly done in this film. I know the Tarantino fans rate all of his stuff as 9s or 10s, but they are not being objective. This film is a terrible attempt at the revenge violence genre.Now my 1 to 10 scale does not include B-movies, kids garbage, or trendy pop. Each one of those genres has it's own place.

I mean it's like Quentin has watched an enjoyed the same movies I did and the same movies that I loved growing up and created this spaghetti western/kung fu epic masterpiece of an odyssey that I've always fantasized of watching. Delicious style mixed with great movie genre loving and savvy film knowledge, a great sound track, amazing acting performances and beautiful photography makes that movie a joy to watch.I'll be waiting for the DVD that will combine the two volumes and it will be hard to find another movie to get obsessed about!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
625,bighand99-1,Exercise in Self-Indulgence,1,25 April 2004,"All I have to say is WOW, what a big let down.  After loving the first Kill Bill, i went into this with high hopes.  Knowing it couldn't have been better that Vol. 1, i wasn't expecting the best.  But i had no idea it could be this bad.  The film, although not exactly horrible, is by far the worst Tarantino movie i have ever seen.  The dialogue, pacing, and acting all work together to solidify this movie has one of the biggest letdowns in film history (far behind the matrix revolutions, of course).   This movie seems like pure self-indulgence on Quentin Tarantino's part.  He draws out scenes to the point where you want to shot yourself. Now, i'm not saying it is horrible, i really enjoyed about 10 to 20 percent of it.  But the rest is horribly written crap.  None of the characters can get a whole sentence out before they pause 4 or 5 times to let the audience catch up to the previous three words they just said. Don't even get me started on the overrated David Carradine.  I don't know how anybody thought he was good in this film.  Maybe good for David Carradine, but not good for any other legitimate actor.  Uma did ok, but her line delivery wasn't anything to cheer about.  Michael Madsen was tolerable as was Darryl Hannah, until Quentin decided to have her spat out that crap about the black mamba. I think Quentin thinks that if he draws out a scene 5 minutes longer than it is supposed to be with a monologue about snakes or comic books he is supposed to be considered brilliant.  Surprisingly that is what everyone is saying, but i found it be the opposite. Alright, i am done ranting about this film.  Go see it if you haven't yet and please take note of what i am saying.  Oh and the cinematography and camera angles are good, as is the music. There is the 10 to 20%",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

627,snakej32,I feel so cheated SPOLIERS,7,16 April 2004,"Kill Bill Volume 1 was a masterpiece, there is no doubt about that but this huge dissapointment Tarantino calls a second half does not do it justice. So many things make no sense and go against the whole style of the movie. Even the soundtrack sucks compared to the first. If you havent seen it yet dont read on SPOLIERS: The part when she is buried alive in the coffin and manages to not only break the coffin open, but she manages to get through all the hundreds of pounds of dirt that are coming in by what can only be described as flying through it to the top. So she can fly now, great. The whole scene with Elle is too short, and the sword fight doesnt last long at all. Another scene that was over promoted was the introductory chapel scene, Tarantino and others blew it out of proportion before its release saying that it was the whole scene of what really happened. In reality, they didnt even need to show it at all. All it shows of the actual ""massacre"" is a few seconds after the D.I.V.A.S. walk into the chapel (from behind no less), only to slowly back away from the chapel and only hear whats happening inside for about 10 seconds. And what the hell happened to Budd?? There's no big fight scene, theres no nothing with him and the bride, + he went from being one of the worlds most elite assassins to a poor alchaholic living in a trailer who's working as a bouncer at some strip club and it doesn't even say why. And he's randomly Bill's brother now and it barely mentions something about some kind of argument between them but nothing more. And Elle has him killed because she regrets that he killed The Bride when she told him to do it?!?! In Addition, the scene with the chinese assassin makes no sense, as assassins do not just leave their marks out of compassion or whatever you want to call it. Tarantino also cut the scene with the most potential which was Yuki's Revenge. The biggest injustice of all however, has to be the final scene between Bill and the Bride. Kill Bill is the title of the movie, and you'd think that The Bride's and Bill's fight would be some kind of epic battle, considering that the bride had such a hard time killing his assassins who don't even have half of the training or skills that he has. But no, the scene lasts for probably a little under a minute, and Bill puts up no kind of fight at all. I thought it was gonna be the climax of the movie! If their battle would have been longer I would have a much better opinion of the film. This movie does have some funny moments, and a few good scenes (especially the one with Pai Mei). I saw the first in theatres multiple times, and it remains one of my favorite movies, so me being so dissapointed with this one really says something about it. And it's not because it was ""slow"" because most of the best movies of all time are ""Slow"" and i've always been a fan of Tarantino's dialouge. And don't listen to any of this **** about it being complete now, this should have been one movie, it would have be much better and Tarantino would have had to cut some of the pointless and stupid crap making which would make the movie a great whole instead of a brilliant first half with a conclusion that pales in comparison.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

The references are everywhere - the whole master/disciple relationship of Pai Mei (Gordan Liu) and the Bride (reminiscent of Liu's 1978 36th Chamber of Shaolin - probably the best martial arts film ever made).  Also, the Leone-esque narrative construct with long, drawn out takes.  All the close-ups of feet (similar to De Palma's infatuation with hands).  Even the whole buried alive sequence and rising from the grave conjures up images of De Palma's Body Double/Carrie. This film is true brilliance, and is a great end to an epic revenge saga.

I believe it's more of a Tarantino hype then the movie is worthy. A lot of funny pointers too any move we ever might have seen, but also overdone. Very nice photography, very well instructed. I lack the kung fu capabilities of ""little Grasshopper""/Kwai Chang Kain David Carradine. My guess is they made a lot of money by spending as little as possible on locations, scenery and background. But why not if you can get away with it? As this is the part two of one movie I'm afraid that the whole thing is too long (4 hours) for a single line story, in which some impossibilities repeat to much, there could have been a bit more creative vision on these points. All together: a good film, bit overrated now, but it will also be a very nice part on the resume of Quintin over the years.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
631,rodew,Movie-making that delivers a great story,10,13 November 2004,"***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***OK so if you are a fan of Vol 1, then the expectation for Vol 2 is for more action like the first and a final intense climactic fight scene where Bill dies and the Bride barely lives. What this movie delivers is the rest of the story while telling the whole story. I liked Kill Bill Vol 1 because of the superb fight scenes, the Bride's single-minded intensity for revenge, and the homage paid to the 70's kung fu/karate film genre. What I did not understand was who she was, how she got there and why was she beaten and left for dead. Bill's answer, ""I over-reacted"", is as classic a movie line as "" dying ain't a good way to make a living"" (outlaw josey wales). Kill Bill Vol 2 was a phenomenal adventure in story telling. I wish that there was more scenes with Pai Mei and the Bride training, I wish there was a scene were the Bride dismembers the pipsqueak who helped bury her alive, and honestly, a scene that defines or establishes Bill and the Bride's relationship (why did he choose her in the first place, especially over Vivica Fox and Lucy Liu who were much better looking). Also, the Bride carries significant respect around the world (the world's most dangerous woman), I appreciated knowing that near the end, but it would have been better to have that knowledge brought forth in some fashion, like Oren Ishii's anime story. I like Uma but I could not fathom how she could go from overdosed woman on the lawn (pulp fiction) to this uncanny killer (vol 1). Vol 2 brought this home for me.I thought the acting was exceptional by Madsen, Uma, and even Darryl Hannah (a long way from Splash). Superb scenes: the Hanzo sword in the golf bag; the bride walking across the street with dirt being blown off after digging her way out; the bride being blown away with rock salt(?)shotgun pellets; the cruel tutelage of Pai Mei; Elle reading about the Black Mamba venom as Budd writhes on the floor.Interesting plot lines: Budd selling the Bride's sword for 1 million; Budd not killing her with real shotgun shells; Budd taking that crap from that scummy owner; Budd disrespecting Elle before counting his money; how Elle is even still in the picture(was she a protege also, until she poisoned Pai Mei?); the brides name.Questionable: why guns in this movie?; how did the Bride know her baby was alive or what she looked like?; Samuel L. Jackson is wasted; when do we learn that The Bride is Black Mamba?; and most questionable- why did the Bride leave Bill in the first place?Her story seemed quite selfish, although it was superbly enacted in the movie. His answer, although incredibly long-winded, was helpful for me and I actually agreed with his other classic movie line, ""when a murderous bastard over reacts, what do you expect would happen"". Bill was saddened that the love of his life and his prized protege had died (or so he thought)and was angered to find her alive, due to give birth to their child, and getting married to a total loser. Chris Rock would say of Bill's actions: ""I don't agree with his tactics, but I can understand his mindset""Finally, as I did with Pulp Fiction, I assimilated the entire Kill Bill story in my mind and fashioned that, although the story telling is disjointed and incongruous, the story is utterly fascinating with a great moral: If you are going to kill the love of your life because you found out she did not die, but she just left you to have a baby and attempt to have a normal life, and she happens to be the most significantly dangerous, skillful, ruthless and cold-blooded assassin on the planet, then your days are numbered if she survives. As Budd states, another classic movie line: ""the woman deserves her revenge and we deserve to die""",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

After assassinating two of her Ex colleges, Female Assassin The Bride sets out to assassinate her two other former colleges and kill her Ex Boss Bill who is holding her daughter in his custody. I love KILL BILL: VOLUME 2. Uma did good acting especially, she did well-acting at the end of the film when she crying in the bathroom, i thought it was a shame that Uma didn't get a Oscar for her performance. What was good about VOL. 2, was it had all the answers. David Carradine was born to play Bill. The music by Quentin Tarrantino's best-friend Robert Rodriguez was good. I thought the song ""About her"" by Malcolm McClaren had good music and good lyrics, the song was about the relationship between The Bride and B.B. The fight between Elle and The Bride was a whoop-a** showdown and Elle got what she deserved. I thought the opening sequence when Uma is talking to the audience ""When i arrive at my destination. I'm gonna Kill Bill"" is one of the most memorable moments in cinema history. This is a highly-recommended film for fans of Quentin Tarrantion, Uma Thurman and David Carradine.

Everything about this movie is fascinating. I felt not one moment of boredom.I hate long winded reviews so I'll just say go see this movie today. The acting is first rate ( watch for Michael Parks in this one!) with Thurman, Carridine and Madsen all turning in stellar performances but, oh my gosh, that wonderful Daryl Hannah is absolutely *the* femme fatale for me. She makes evil look so sexy and so beautiful that it's scary.

There are even a few surprises along the way and you get to see much more of Bill than in Vol. 1. He is no longer the mysterious man in the shadows, Tarantino really develops his character in part 2. Even non Tarantino fans should make an effort to see this movie. Although I don't think you would get the depth of the story from just watching Vol 2, you certainly could without be lost.

As with all of Tarantino's films (sans the legitimately well-crafted Pulp Fiction), Kill Bill: Vol. 2 works exceedingly hard at coming across as smarter than it really is... and as always, this ultimately fruitless technique leaves Tarantino's film looking even worse than it needed to.Even operating under the notion that the film is making a conscious effort to make fun of itself and point out how bad it truly is, it still falls flat. By relying on the same two gags over and over again, Tarantino is offering up a veritable admission that he's in too far over his head, and that he really has no clue what he's doing.To top it all off, Tarantino lies back on techniques usually reserved for enhancing a film, or, at the very least, enhancing a scene. But Tarantino throws these techniques in haphazardly, filming a scene in black and white not because it helps the scene in any way, but simply because he's taking a random crack at producing intelligence.Looking at the two films (Volume 1 and Volume 2) as a whole, it becomes painfully obvious that Tarantino split these up solely in an effort to make more money, or else he has no sense of direction whatsoever, because the two films are split as unevenly as possible. Even as one film, all the action takes place at the beginning and all the elements that are supposed to represent plot and character development are crammed into the latter half. Even worse, this second film is comprised mostly of filler that has no real relevance to the story that Tarantino is already butchering.All in all, the film is nothing you wouldn't expect from Tarantino, but that's not a good thing by any means. The characters are flat and uninteresting, the dialogue is Tarantino's worst to date, and the whole film feels more like a mockery of cinematic techniques than anything else. On the whole, this film isn't quite as much an abysmal failure as the first, but it comes close.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
636,vegged,Even better than Vol. 1,10,19 April 2004,"What can I say?  Vol. 1 was awesome, but Vol. 2 is even better!  Tarantino is a genius filmmaker and this movie is another masterpiece, perhaps even surpassing (dare I say?) Pulp Fiction.  Vol. 2 is not as cinematic as Vol. 1 but it ties up all the lose strings and questions of the first movie and it does so in a very unpredictable way.  We all know that the bride is out for her revenge, but there are many twists and turns along the way that I never saw coming.  I don't know what it is, but Tarantino has a way of getting great performances out of his cast.  Don't get me wrong, it's a great cast, but I've never seen them better than in this movie.  The long stretches of diologue between the action is fantastic, due largely to great writing and great performances.  It's all very entertaining and gripping.It's been a long time since Jackie Brown, but it was certainly worth the wait.  If this is what we can expect from Mr. Tarantino then I'm willing to wait seven years between pictures.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
637,Lekazard,Eric Forrester knows kung fu in a spaghetti western set,8,24 April 2004,"I'm one of those persons who watched vol 1 with my jaw wide open. The killing spree in the end of the movie was something which I never had seen before. Even though people get sliced, cut and decapitated the katana massacre was't exaggerated nor gross.I believe I represent a typical QT fan and from this point of view KB2 was a disappointment. Not a big one but still. First of all the flick is way too long. There are couple of scenes which have very little/none to do with the plot and they are somewhat loose from the rest of the movie. If QT hadn't cut the story in half, these scenes probably would have not been included.Secondly the dialogue is surprisingly dull. This issue was also somewhat included in vol 1 but it wasn't that noteworthy 'cause the movie had lots of action and little speech. This movie is the opposite. It wouldn't bother me if the dialogue was good but this time it's incredibly far from the level which we have been used to in QT movies. Mostly it's just merely meaningless chit chat.But the movie isn't actually that bad. The cast is good and acting is quite excellent. David Carradine steals every scene he appears in. Daryl Hannah is also good (losing the only working eye and getting blinded in a trailer in the middle of a desert, that's just sad. That poor bitch).If KB1 was Pulp Fiction then KB2 is more like Jackie Brown. In my opinion, the films would've worked better if they were both in one properly cut.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
638,ransuru,too slow too bad,3,5 May 2004,"Kill Bill 2 is a long agonizing view of a director's self loving extravaganza. There are a few really cool moments most of them are in the second trailer. The plot again was off balance but there was no fun, no wittiness and no real action. It's all a big build up to a stupid ""Lord of the rings"" long ending without the caring or the plot to keep the viewer interested. Uma Thurman is pretty but no one can just stare at her for 135 minutes without getting bored. The rest of the cast played with a  cartoon charecter's depth is annoying at best. Budd is a clasical shouthern idiot which doesn't explain how he is a brother to Bill and the rest of the cast including the charecter of the martial arts teacher are shallow and do little to entertain while spiting their lines with overacting seen usually in college productions.

642,beaudelairemaher,A quite literate tribute to movie-making,10,12 November 2006,"Where KILLBILL V0L1 appeared to be a tribute, an homage, to Japanese film makers, VOL 2 is a tribute to QT's vision. As David Furey observed it was like Tarrantino spent a lot of his energies and inspiration in making this movie and said to the rest of Hollywood: This is the best I can do; try to top it.I went to the theater to see the same movie seven times in a month twice in my life. The movies: DOCTOR ZHIVAGO and KILL BILL VOLUME 2. Volume1 is filled with gore; I found it overkill (pun intended); if you look closely, you will notice that no one as shop, hacked up, or otherwise stabbed. We are not shown the massacre and we only see three people die Bill is killed hand-to-hand, Buck is killed snake-to-face, and Elle shows us in a flashback how she poisoned Pei Mai. Quite graphic, but without a plethora of violent scenes. I admit to my students that this movie is in my top five (along with ONCE UPON A TIME IN America, CITIZEN KANE, MILLER'S CROSSING and THE RETURN OF THE KING),but I've never recommended it in class, not because of the violence, but because of the level of the vocabulary and the subtlety of the humour. Elle Diver: Gargantuan is such a lovely word, It's too bad one gets to use it so seldom in a sentence.The daughter's role is so well done, I wonder how much more of the movie she was allowed to see.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
643,ernestosan,"IT IS... CUTE!!!, TENDER!!!, AND MOVING!!!",10,6 April 2004,"CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS. This is the first time I've waited so long with anticipation to see a sequel. Finally, last friday I went to the first press screening for Kill Bill Vol. 2 in L.A. The theatre was packed and the emotion began as soon as the Miramax logo appeared on the screen. Then the ""Silhoutte of Doom"" theme by Ennio Morricone. And then, there she was, the Bride talking to the camera in her way to kill Bill. The applause went bigger when the title Volume 2, in a film noir kind of style, appeared. I'm not going to give away any significant spoilers. The film lasts almost 2 hours and a half. It consists of another five chapters. Every one of them is shot in different styles and different kind of film stock. And of course, they are all told in non-linear order. There is an extraordinary ""cat fight"" between The Bride and Elle Driver. It is quite the opposite from the elegance of the scene between O-Ren and The Bride at the end of Vol.1, but it is equally effective. And probably, the most memorable scene of the film: I'm not going to tell you what happens, but it is one that provokes claustrophobic feelings in the audience and is quite terrifying. You'll know what I'm talking about right away when you see the movie. The rest of the movie is soooo different from Vol.1, that you won't believe it is actually part of the same story. Tarantino lowers the level of violence in a pretty significant way, and dwells on a complex love story between Bill and The Bride, who have more things in common that you would think. And who would have known that Bill was such a cool intellectual guy? The movie is almost 100 percent dialogue-dialogue-dialogue and the music is pretty spaghetti western like. We all know what happens at the end. But many will be surprised (and I hope not dissapointed) at how Tarantino resolved it in the end. Just try to understand every word Bill says to The Bride trough the movie and you'll probably loooove the way it ends. Don't expect something graphic, though. But rather, something quite emotional. It goes really deeper than anyone of the press members expected. Kill Bill Vol. 2 goes straight for the audience's heart (well... o.k. you'll see). At the end of the movie, though many adored it and many despised it, we all agreed that Tarantino has surprised us again. The words that people uttered were ""it is cute"", ""tender"" ""moving""...!!! Did we expect that from Tarantino? Never. Is it wrong to make a love story? No, not at all, especially when he is so good at it. Is it better than Volume 1? No, it is different. Extremely different. Is it worth the wait? Hell YEAH!!! ... But will it leave you wanting for a Volume 3?.... Nah.... The Bride has completed her journey. Now, move over.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

However, at this stage I confess I prefer part one a little more.Part two is different, quite different. It slows down a lot, it hangs on the characters. A great idea in theory, but not in delivery. Tarantino seems a little too much in love with himself and his characters, so he lingers on them a fraction too long for comfort. when the actions comes (the Elle Driver fight scene), boy does it come.Those expecting more of what volume one promised may be disappointed, and most will find the dialogue a little nerdy and uninteresting, but nevertheless it's a very strong movie, and without doubt worth repeated viewings.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Vol. 1 ended shortly after endless, over-the-top action sequences. Unfortunately, despite its promising intro, presented satirically by Thurman, Vol. 2 does not live up to its counterpart.Keep in mind that it is only the second half of the same movie, but act two, while undeniably good, lacked what made Vol. 1 great. There is no breathtaking violence aesthetic here, the film only wraps up the story, a disadvantage to the non-linear format that was so powerful in Vol. 1. As a cinematic experience, Vol. 2 felt lacking and incomplete without its sister film. When viewed sequentially as one movie, Kill Bill was a near perfect action movie.

648,Shoegazer29,A TAD DISAPPOINTING...,9,16 April 2004,"Well I just got back from the multiplex, and let me tell you, KILL BILL VOL. 2 IS NOT WHAT MOST VIEWERS ARE GOING TO EXPECT. The only review of Vol. 2 I had read before watching the movie myself was Rolling Stone's Peter Travers's take on things. I have to say that Mr. Travers was more than a little misleading, but that is besides the point (He gave it a 4 out of a 4).The movie begins well enough, with Uma Therman speaking directly to the camera courtesy of cheesy '40s fare. Then The Bride provides backstory on her wedding, her training, and a little on her relationship with Bill. Keep in mind all of this is intercut with the encounters between The Bride and Budd, and The Bride and Elle Driver (We even find out how she lost that eye). The switching up of present and past maintains the fast pace of Vol. 1, while providing indepth insight into The Bride, something new in Vol. 2. ALTOGETHER THE FIRST HOUR IS SOME GREAT FILMMAKING.Unfortunately, it is this newfound appreciation for emotional insight that ends up being the film's worst flaw; THE SECOND HOUR OF THE FILM IS DOMINATED BY TALKING. Not that talking is bad or unnecessary for movies, but the energy of the Vol. 1 is all but lost during some of the particularly grating scenes. Granted there is the final showdown between Bill and Uma, but this is preceded by possibly the most degrading showing from Tarantino yet. And what I mean by that is this (And don't infer that I don't respect Quentin Tarantino, because I do), conversation after conversation, MORE AND MORE IS SPELLED OUT for us. Not in a symbolic or metaphorical sense, but in an actual question and answer session between the film's two key players. I found this to be insulting to my intelligence, and anyone else's for that matter. If you payed any attention to Vol. 1 the whole scene is EXTREMELY PREDICTABLE and LABORIOUS TO WATCH.-i have to pause for a second-After reading what I've written I see that I'M PAINTING AN OVERLY NEGATIVE PICTURE of Kill Bill Vol. 2. I suppose I'm still frustrated that I already bought Vol. 1 on DVD, expecting Vol. 2 to surpass the first and tie everything together. And IF VOL. 2 REALLY TRIES TO DO ONE THING, THAT WOULD BE COMPLETING THE PICTURE. But I must reiterate that that is exactly my problem with this movie, IT STOPS MOVING FORWARD TO PICK UP WHAT IT LEFT BEHIND, AND TAKES ITS TIME DOING SO (And even still one important question is never answered. Why does Hatori Hanzo not like Bill? What drives him to make the sword?).
I say: Kill Bill Vol. 1 - 9/10 Kill Bill Vol. 2 - 7/10 Kill Bill (Whole)- 8/10A two-part to remember, possibly more for its stylistic prowess than anything else, but nothing to live by. A combined release with intermission might have helped. I do realize that isn't very practicle (Look how the Lord of the Rings movies did though, despite length).",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Let those who operate in the real world watch and discuss movies. This movie was not excessively violent, nor was it really all that violent. There is violence in the movie, but its about a professional killer taking her revenge on other professional killers, so grow up. The dialogue was amazing; it was funny, clever, witty and simply brilliant. The bit about Superman is vintage Tarantino (i.e.  Tipping in Reservoir Dogs and Foot Messages in Pulp Fiction). If you didn't like the dialogue, plot, premise, or direction thats one thing, but do not dismiss this movie as being too violent. Tarantino is an artist, and it is about time people start appreciating his art.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
650,akhon,Tarantino back in top form,8,18 April 2004,"I have to admit, I was one of the few people that didn?t like Kill Bill Volume 1.  It was self-indulgent, superficial, soulless, and WAY overrated. Volume 2 takes a 180-degree turn and goes back to the Quentin Tarantino that we all know and love--great storytelling, great character development, wonderful dialog, and dark, wicked humor.*** SPOILERS AHEAD ***The Bride (Uma Thurman) continues her quest for revenge against Bill and the remaining two assassins that tried to kill her during her wedding rehearsal. After a failed attempt at taking out the washed-up Budd (Michael Madsen), the Bride is buried alive and left for dead?again.  In flashback, we learn that the Bride was trained by the legendary martial arts priest, Pai Mei (Gordon Liu in a scene-stealing performance as the bearded, bushy eye browed master).  Having practiced the three-inch punch repeatedly, the Bride manages to hit her way out of her claustrophobic, wooden coffin.
Meanwhile, Budd agrees to sell the Bride?s Hatori Hanzo sword to Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah) for $1 million.  Bitter that a loser like Budd had the pleasure of killing the Bride instead of her, Elle double-crosses him by hiding a black mamba in the suitcase of cash.  With Budd out of the picture and the Hanzo sword in hand, Elle is about to leave Budd?s trailer when is she greeted by a drop kick from the Bride.  What follows is one the best and most brutal catfights ever captured on film.  I won?t spoil the fun with the details, but Elle?s painful demise is sweet poetic justice that only Tarantino could write.All that?s left is Bill (David Carradine).  When the Bride finally tracks him down, she discovers that her daughter is still alive and that Bill has been raising her all this time.  In another flashback, we discover that Bride wanted to quit the business after finding out that she was pregnant. She disappears, and when Bill finally tracks her down, he finds her marrying a record store employee and automatically assumes that the groom is the father of the unborn baby.  Jealous, Bill ?overreacts? and sends in his henchmen to kill everyone in the chapel.  Ahhhh, it all makes sense now!David Carradine delivers an amazing speech near the end of the film that rivals Samuel Jackson?s speech at the end of Pulp Fiction.  Comic book fans will geek out at the Spider-man and Superman references, while screenwriters will geek out at rich metaphors.  Following some more meaty verbal exchange, the Bride and Bill have their showdown, and she takes him out with a secret technique that Pai Mei taught her.With her quest complete, the Bride claims her daughter, exits the world of assassins, and enters the world of motherhood.8 out of 10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
651,cGrantLimbo,"In actuality, less is more",10,18 April 2004,"Having seen part II of Kill Bill on opening night (just like I did with the first back in October), I couldn't help but expect the same amount of bloodshed and action that was so prominent in the first. Underneath it all though, I knew it was time for Tarantino to show us actual characters human sides, or it would just turn out to be two movies of nonstop, illiterate action that would remain derivative and not remain true to himself (Tarantino). The movie started a little slow, and you actually have to listen to the dialogue this time because it's important for things to come. Although, I liked the development and actually had only one eye open waiting in suspense in the opening scene (which is in the same setting as the part I took). I really had a sort of dislike for Tarantino before that I never told anyone, but this film (part I and II as a whole) changed my perspective (although fanboys really annoy me). My biggest surprise was that Daryll Hannah, who has been around forever, is finally showing us that she can act. Having NEVER liked her, I found her introduction in Part I to be stellar and the conclusion of her character Elle Driver even more-satisfying. Out of all of the Brides former cohorts, Elle Driver IMO was the only one that was never friends with her at any given time, as there is a perfect tension between Thurman and Hannah being displayed here. In volume one, Cottonmouth and the Bride finish each other's sentences, and after her demise, you see tears in the corner of the Brides eyes. Before Copperhead dies in the beginning of vol. 1, she asks the Bride if she still likes her coffee a certain way. You could see that at one time these characters actually cared for one another. Budd is questionable, although his feelings of slight disgust for the Bride come more from her earlier affair with Bill, his brother. Point being, Elle Driver was probably always viewed as the blacksheep of the group, with only Bill the Snake Charmer ever giving her a chance. ***SPOILER*******It's funny that the Bride spares her life, one she truly hated, and didn't to those she had once had feelings for in some way or another. Maybe this was her way of saying ""you deserve something worse than death"" and then leaving her with the snake. Driver (California Mtn. Snake) was indeed specialized in the way of poisening people to end their lives, so the Bride wanted her to feel as much of a slow, painful death as Driver gave to her victims.*******end Spoiler*******. Overall, I have to say I liked this movie better, if not necessarily enjoyed it more.

As more is revealed in VOL. 2, the story was very lackluster. With less action & scenes of uninteresting dialogue, I was unsure why everyone claimed this was better than VOL.1. If you edited both movies together in a 2 1/2 movie, it would be much better than sitting through 2 dialogue volumes, but Quentin would have made less money that way. This would have worked much better if the action & dialogue were more evenly distributed instead of 1 being mostly action & 2 mostly dialogue. 1 was filled with more 70's elements & pop culture references & 2 lacked that feel IMO.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Violence is presented as another piece as part of a perfect engaged machine. Dialogs are not as much present as previous T's movies, but they're far enough and works perfectly with the set up of the movie.Just say that Uma Thurman -the bride- overflows her talent in every single shot and reveal herself as a great great actress.

The plot is more developed and the character, Black Mamba is better portrayed as a heroine(vs. just one angry woman)in this episode. Thus, placing abilities of Uma Thurman prominently in the limelight.  As well, the artistic efforts for each frame of the film is notably well thought out; each would make a really cool picture book! However, I was expecting more of a sword fight btw Bill and Beatrix, and more 'squriting blood'!  More so, I thought the end was just too abrupt and it needs more of what I call ""the cool-Tarantino-cheese."" Maybe, simply his style has grown-up?

655,Dekukid,"Elle Driver, Budd ""Sidewinder"", and Bill. Superb trinity to the final act.",10,16 April 2004,"This film cannot be summarized without giving spoilers, but I'll try my best. There are *SPOILERS* for Kill Bill Volume 1 though.After The Bride took her vengeful violent wrath upon Go-Go, O-Ren, and Vernita, she continues on to her last targets. So, her next targets are marked, but what kind of crazy stuff is going down this time? This is not as gory as the first volume. There are no decapitations that I remember, no spurting blood fountains, no bloodbaths at all pretty much. There is still a lot of disturbing images.The acting is stupendous. Uma Thurman delivers a performance worthy of an Academy Award, there are some scenes that just scream ""Academy! Look at me!"", but they're pulled off so good, that their purpose is fulfilled. Michael Madsen is the focus of a good chunk of the first half. He's gotten a helluva lot worse after leaving Bill's team, and has a dead-end job, but he's still the same 'Texas killer' he fashions himself as. There is a lot of things going on with his character, and I rank him up their with Uma Thurman for his acting. Dave Carradine is mysterious in his role, and his lines are quite melodramatic, but he delivers them quite tastefully so Quentin's mediocre writing for this character is forgiven. Elle Driver is a treat that I thought would be just another character to kill. She had that super-cool almost sarcastic tone to her voice. I have to say, Daryl was awesome in her role to the point I almost liked her, despite she was created to be hated.All in all, it's awesome. Way better than the gore-flash-fest of the first, and it truly shows Quentin's ability to direct a wide range of styles, and also shows Uma Thurman and Michael Madsen's great acting skills.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
656,samaase,Annoying character inconsistency vs. KB vol.1,6,5 December 2004,"Without going into any plot-spoiler details for those who have not seen it, I found Kill Bill Vol.2 to be at points overly pretentious (like Vol.1), disgusting, and amusing. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it overall. But what struck me most is some serious inconsistency in ""The Bride"" character vs. what was portrayed in Vol.1. For that reason alone, I couldn't enjoy this movie with the same level of surprise and amazement as its predecessor. Among my friends who piled heaping praise on Kill Bill Vol.2 (somewhat more so even than Kill Bill Vol.1), I have to wonder about the extent to which they have gotten caught up the hype and ""cool factor"" surrounding Tarantino movies, vs. really acknowledging the shortcomings and inconsistencies of Tarantino's plot development and characterization. Both these movies will probably leave you ""agreeing to disagree"" if you're a Tarantino-phile.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
657,Haio,The difference between two films...,9,17 April 2004,"There's a point in Volume 2, where The Bride/Black-Mamba/Uma Thurman is shot in the chest with a shotgun.  She flies back a few feet and hits the ground.  What happens next is unbelievable- nothing.  Blood doesn't fly 12 feet into the air.  But isn't this Kill Bill?  Isn't it the second Volume of Tarantino's blood saga of vengeance.  Yes it is, but then again- No it isn't.I don't know.  Maybe if it was somebody else- blood would have shot up. But nowhere in Vol. 2 do those annoying bursts make an appearance.The two films are so different that nothing I read could prepare me for how Vol. 2 would flow.  Considering I didn't like Vol. 1, this was very good for me.  Considering some did... well, this will test their loyalty to Tarantino- or just the KILL BILL saga in general.Looking back on Vol. 1 I can easy pinpoint many things I didn't like: The over-the-top-sickening anime sequence, the lack of depth, the lack of story, the lack of development, the lack of sanity... I could go on (you know I could)On Vol. 2, however, there is almost nothing I can say I didn't like. Anime- none. Depth- it's like the deep end of a swimming pool.  Story- told with massive heart. Development- so much it would sicken anyone who loved the first just for bloodshed.  Sanity- WELL, this IS a Tarantino film (Luckily, because Vol.1- well, its not a film if it doesn't take itself seriously, is it?)Thurman and Carradine who play The Bride and Bill (respectively) are unbelievably good.  Every moment they are on the screen a love-hate feeling just drifts... Their performances flesh out the characters who were empty in Vol. 1.  And, the fact that Tarantino decided to finally write helped.Ultimately Kill Bill ends as a drama, but spins back into Homage for the credits.  For those who stick around for the closing credits- you can see just how much fun Q & U (as they credit themselves) had just by the one outtake.Uma deserves an Oscar nod for this one, and if it's not too much of a stretch, toss one to Carradine for supporting.Before you see Vol. 2, ask yourself- ""Action or Story?""  Which do you prefer?  Because if all you want from Quentin is a bloody-mockery of a film, you might as well stay home and watch Vol. 1.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

It was good, but not half as cool as the first, and the directing style and story pacing felt completely different.It was like watching another movie altogether, and the movie isn't even a true sequal.  I think that Tarentino had too much time to get into the characters because of splitting the movie.  Instead on concentrating on 'Cool', he concentrated on character and plot development.  This is normally a great, great thing that Hollywood needs more of, but in this case, I feel it back-fired.Don't get me wrong, Kill Bill Vol.2 is a good movie.

It's plainly obvious from the start that the piece was meant to be whole and therefore we the movie going public were forced into a 6 month intermission between films. Call me cynical but the fact that this movie came out 5 days after the DVD release of part 1 just smacks of a blatant attempt to rake in more cash from the consumer. That said I really enjoyed the movie, in a different way to part 1. The dialogue is more prolonged here, there are no massive fight sequences and no manga cartoons that cry out 'Hey, look at me, I'm QT and I've done something no other director has - worship my coolness!'. Taking away my cynical streak the movie was very enjoyable. I enjoyed the fleshing out of the characters and the anticipation of how each one would meet their end. The fact that I revisited Part 1 just before helped me to get straight into the plot(another reason I am annoyed at the split) and there are plenty of clever, funny and striking scenes to make even the most cynical movie-goer appreciate Tarantino at his best. Every one of the main cast are on top form, and Carradine's Bill dominates every scene in which he appears, including his ending, which unfortunately did come across as a little far fetched. But that is one of the main appeals in these movies. They are set in an unreal world where people can kill at will and not get arrested. And where humans can act like superheroes and still have very human emotions. Tarantino drags you into his world, grabs your interest, and makes you believe what he is doing is cool - and fun. I appreciated this movie as a very entertaining work, and to that end I can just about forgive the self indulgent splitting of the two movies.HIghlights for me were Daryl Hannah reading to Budd about snake venom, and Uma's training with her master, Pai Mei. The guy was just great - I love the way he screamed at her and how he was prone to stroking his beard! All in all this movie is great, and I would just prefer it to Part 1, merely because I like the characterisation. But to be honest both parts should be viewed as one movie, as I am sure they were originally intended.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
660,Drunkwilly,A True Masterpiece!!,10,26 April 2004,"Tarantino has truly outdone himself with the second installment of Kill Bill!!  This movie and its predecessor transcend the normal parameters of, ""sequelness,"" and usher an innovative and sheik perspective on film making. The first film was a true, first-rate action movie, driven by frustration, anger, and of course: VENGENCE!  The second was truly a great movie, that wasn't so driven by revenge as it was a critique on motherhood and dysfunctional relationships.  In any case both of these movies compliment each other to no end.  Kill Bill Vol. 2 especially sits close to my heart alongside Vol. I as truly one of my favorite movies!!  It also sits prominently atop the huge mountain made up of vast amounts of movies and their subsequent sequels!!

662,papillonflyers,Not like the first one,8,14 May 2004,"Kill Bill Volume 2 The film begins with a flashback to the wedding rehearsal of the Bride (Uma Thurman) in El Paso, Texas, that is interrupted by the arrival of Bill (David Carradine), the leader of a band of assassins and her former boss and lover. Pregnant with his child, she has decided to start her life anew. Bill's heart is broken, and he responds by releasing all his pent-up anger. As we remember from ""Kill Bill,"" the Bride survives the massacre and a gunshot wound to her head and vows to avenge herself on Bill and his assassins who ended her bid for a normal life. There are numerous ""problems"" with KB2, the main one being the simple fact that it's too damn ""talky."" Almost nothing happens for about the first 50 minutes of KB2. The film immediately put me off when it spent the first 20 minutes (which felt like two hours) rehashing the wedding scene, yet again!The Bride's martial-arts clash with the eye-patched Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) provides a welcome burst of adrenaline, as the pair do expertly choreographed battle in the extremely close quarters of a trailer home. Erasing all former images of herself, Hannah provides the most venomous of the ""Kill Bill"" villains. But none of these fights compares with the ""Vol. 1"" climactic samurai battle. What's missing, and this is bound to disappoint fans of the first part, are the fights. There is very little actual swordplay, and none of the demented set pieces that gave the first film its insane energy. In all ""Kill Bill 2"" feels like a dull knife. (C)",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Nothing new or interesting was revealed, the story was a total letdown.If you think the second movie will bring something new to tale you are wrong, I wouldn't have believed it but you can already guess exactly what happens in Vol 2 by watching Vol 1. So apart from dragging it out a little more there is hardly any purpose for Vol 2, a simple sentence of what happened would easily conclude the story,it didn't need another 2hrs or more of rambling which had no real drama or action worthy of keeping our attention. It's certainly a movie I would never want to watch more than once!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
664,gmorgan-4,Honestly better than the first,10,24 July 2004,"Kill Bill Volume 2 is the astonishing follow-up to perhaps 2003's best film, Kill Bill Volume 1. Quentin Tarantino once again demonstrates a mastery of dialogue in this homage to the great western and kung fu movies that inspired him from his video clerk days.Simply, this film is as entertaining as hell. Tarantino unabashedly takes the viewer for a joyride, and the end result is a movie with intense action, tempered with some of the best dialogue I have ever heard.Some have pointed to this film as inferior to the first volume of Kill Bill: I disagree. Whereas Tarantino is a great action director (the scene in the first film with the crazy 88s is one of my top five favorite battle scenes of all time), he even surpasses this talent in his ability to write witty, intriguing dialogue: and this film really delivers it. One scene in particular, with David Carradine as Bill, near the end, speaking with Uma Thurman's The Bride while he makes a sandwich, is unforgettable and insightfully interesting. There are few points where the film drags, and the movie ultimately creates the impression of a visceral experience. 10/10. Go see this film, it is by far the best film released so far this year.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

All of the actors are fierce: Where in the world was Daryl Hannah!? She did an extraordinary job, Oscar-worthy. Don't let me start with David Carradine, who was marvelous. And The Bride herself... God, Uma gets better over the years. She knows with who she should work, and that's why she's working with Quentin. A brilliant genius who knows how to jump from genre to genre, from the greatest catfight to the softest moment between a mom and her daughter.This should teach em how a movie should be make.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
666,dartslinger2,Slower than Vol. 1,7,10 April 2013,"The sequel to Kill Bill: Vol. 1 is not nearly as good as the first. The first was excellent: it was quite poignant, it was exciting, fast paced, intriguing, and it had one of the best soundtracks I have ever heard.The second was not so good in these areas. I didn't find it to be touching at all, as the first was. This one was exciting at times, but it was definitely a slower-moving film than the first one was. Not that being slower-moving than the first is necessarily a bad thing, but this one seemed to have excessive dialogue.Another area where Vol. 2 fell short is the soundtrack: I found many of the pieces to be unhelpful in setting the tone of certain parts of the movie. The music, instead of drawing you into the moment, drew excessive attention to itself.Kill Bill Vol. 1 was extremely gory, but chopped off heads and arms didn't really gross me out—at least not as much as the eyeball being squished between someone's toes, and the vitreous humor oozing out that appeared in Vol. 2. Overall though, Kill Bill Vol. 2 wasn't nearly as violent as Vol. 1 was. The entire tone was much sleazier though, especially the beginning of the movie.Kill Bill Vol. 2 was a competent movie, but it was not the masterpiece that Kill Bill Vol. 1 was.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
667,bluesky-23,Surprisingly wonderful,9,9 February 2005,"First of all, let's make one thing clear: I have never been a Tarantino fan and have never seen his other movies. They never appealed to me one iota. Yet the trailers for Kill Bill so intrigued me I finally had to watch Kill Bill, Vol. 1. I liked some of it, I started to understand why he is critically adored, but as a whole, it really wasn't outstanding. KB1 was fun to watch, but sometimes over-the top and lacking in coherence and plot. I watched KB2 simply to see how it ended but without high expectations. I was blown away.From the black-and-white beginning where Uma addresses the camera to the final shot as the credits roll, there are so many brilliant moments I can't even list them all. The flashbacks to the wedding chapel and her conversation with Bill completely draw you into the characters and (which KB1 never did) make you care about what happens to them. The scenes in the coffin are so claustrophobic you feel trapped yourself, and the moment when her hand bursts out of the dirt is so terrific it induces cheering. Walking into the diner covered in dirt and politely asking for a glass of water is another great moment, reminiscent of the gunslinger walking into a bar. There are other wonderful Western homages and Western-style music which are incredibly cool as well. There are of course great action sequences with Pai Mei and Daryl Hannah and cringe moments (the snake and the eyeball) but thankfully, no ludicrous blood spurting as in Vol. 1. (There are also very funny moments as well, in particular the reaction of Daryl Hannah to the tobacco spit - a totally girl moment and absolutely hilarious.) But the genius of Kill Bill, Vol. 2 is in the dialogue between Bill and the Bride (aka Beatrix Kiddo we discover), and in the wonderful scenes with their daughter (such as: playing with toy guns; David Carradine making sandwiches, butcher knife in hand; tucking her daughter in bed for the first time; the superhero discussion... all moments to savor).Ultimately, KB2 is an amazing tribute to motherhood and what makes us women. Even such a cold-blooded killer as Beatrix changes her entire life and does anything to save her child once she learns she is pregnant. The credits say it all: the shot of Uma smiling at her daughter, driving away, and AKA: Mommy as the last line - a defining part of her character from this point onward. She isn't just a killer, as Bill implied, who can never lead a normal life; she can be something more. It's a shame that a lot of women will see this as a guy's movie and not be drawn to it; as a woman, I loved the movie even more for the development of Uma's character and her stunning performance. And I have far more respect and admiration for Tarantino as a filmmaker than I ever did before. If you think this movie isn't exactly your cup of tea, try it anyway (if you have a tolerance for the action sequences) - you might be delightfully surprised.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

This one is even worst then the 1st kill bill! I could only stand to watch 30 minutes of the second film and had to leave to room. I could not even stand to hear this movie in the back ground as I tried to read a magazine at that point. I lost interest of the movie when Uma was shot in the chest. After being shot in the chest with a beanbag and buried alive she manages to claw her way out. I would not recommend this movie to any one!

670,jesusesque,Some Unsaid Critiques,7,8 December 2014,"Reading old critics or new users, few are saying what I thought upon release and now, re-watching these. Only posting because of that. 1)the dialogue almost never coheres into the electric, fascinating rhythms of ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Reservoir Dogs."" This movie is more like ""Death Proof"": it often seems like a cheeky imitation of ""bad"" dialogue from genre movies Tarantino loves. There are actual cringe moments nobody dared tell uh, ""Q"" (cringe moment 1) made them cringe. The most ""Pulp Fiction""-like scene involves a strip-club owner yelling at a bouncer for being late. 2)The approach to dialogue and style nearly strangles the emotional film, whether it's a revenge drama or whatever it is. Tarantino's talent in his best movies clearly is utterly compelling episodic scenes, often grounded in a weird mix of references to real humanity and movie humanity. He's kind of chucked real humanity out the window here, and it hurts him. I don't quite see the throughline from ""Pulp Fiction"" to this, ""Kill Bill"" is trying something new, for better or worse. Often it's worse, as ""the Bride"" must carry the film, and her character motivations often get lost in the stylistic shuffle.3)It's a revenge fantasy, but the sterility of the stylized reality and heightened Kung-fu world manage to strip vengeance of much meaning, reward or even coherence. Uma Thurman does a good job panting, looking hurt and crying, but she also frequently sits down and smiles and chit-chats. While contrasts between chit-chatting hit men and brutal killing were stunning in ""Pulp Fiction,"" in a film with a central protagonist fueled by (presumable) undying vengeance, these scenes undermine the character, and really undermine much emotional punch. I think that's about it, most people (me included) mostly have positive stuff to say about the movie. There's fun, clever fights, brilliant use of music, much inspired stuff. But I think a mix of weak, possibly ""indulgent"" writing and tonal miscalculations make this clearly not a masterpiece. A tighter revenge-based action film might have been better, a more ""Tarantino"" (in the ""Pulp Fiction"") sense) ""realistic"" vengeance film might have been better. The two approaches don't sit in perfect harmony with one another.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
671,zhekov,Can't understand why people find it boring,9,25 December 2008,"Albeit I like vol.1 more (which is normal, for a fan of Shogun Assassin), comments like ""why so many pointless dialogs"" or ""she wrote a list, but failed to kill everyone"" surprise me. You know what, in life we often talk, not because we have to, not because it's important, but just like that. And we don't always keep our promises - the things happen in an unexpected way, or we reconsider at some point, or simply don't care to.You know what I find really boring? The hour-and-half Hollywood movies, in which people speak what they are supposed to, do what are supposed to do, and everything is predictable from the first five-or-so minutes. It's refreshing to see a movie in which the heroine can take a break and simply talk to somebody. Makes her alive, I suppose... more vital than Black Knight or V.Oh, and there isn't a finale grande, with a long sword fight. So what? Honestly, if I was to write The End, she wouldn't even kill Bill, just take her daughter and go away. Maybe even sue for the house or moral injuries :) (or whatever you call it in US).",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
672,t-h-flint,"sound, fury and absolutely nothing else; I'm embarrassed to have contributed to its gross takings",1,18 January 2006,"Everyone is anxious to underline how clever Tarantino is at paying homage to a broad range of cinematic influences. Whilst I'm sure that these references must satisfy those members of the audience who recognise them, they wholly fail to make up for the misery suffered by those who don't. Neither Kill Bill film has anything else to redeem it. The dialogue is woeful throughout, retaining all the style but none of the substance of Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs. The performances are two-dimensional and completely un-involving, although much of the blame for that must fall on Tarantino for having penned such feeble characters. Because you don't care about anyone on screen, the violence appears aimless and gratuitous. But the worst thing about these films is that the ""Tarantino"" badge seems to be enough for some to excuse these terminal flaws, where any other director would be completely torn to pieces. Those of us who believe that film-making should be about involving an audience and telling a story can only hope that the aura of infallibility that surrounds the man is dissipated rapidly after these spineless and inept films. The tragedy is that they will probably only feed the hype. Whatever the fans say, style can never survive without substance; thankfully we can be sure that this meaningless rubbish will disappear into the mists of time, and the sooner the better.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
673,hunterprimm,"Not as good as the first, still keeps it fresh",9,10 June 2017,"Now this is an interesting continuation. It really barely has a lot of what the original has. There is action but it is so much different. For one, this movie takes influence from many different other genres. The first pretty clearly took influence from samurai and kung-fu movies. And this one very clearly takes influence from westerns. It doesn't feel out of place though, especially with Budd in this movie. This movie is also more dramatic. And comedic. It's a weird tonal shift from the original movie but it still works. Somehow. The tone doesn't work quite as well balancing the drama and the comedic as say Pulp Fiction or Inglourious or Django or even the first Kill Bill. But just knowing this is a Tarantino movie makes it work. And it doesn't get rid of all Asian influences. Lest we forget the funny and pretty great Pai Mei sequences? Now this movie also takes itself a lot slower. It starts with a great little talking to the audience with a tension filled score under it. And then it slows down with showing us the wedding rehearsal where this whole bloody story begins. Then, she goes after Budd, fails and is buried alive. Then we go back even further so we know how she got all the kung-fu she knows. Then it is fairly linear. I can see how this would feel jumbled, but Tarantino takes real care of these sequences with fantastic editing and shots.Although done with more western flair, the movie has plenty of style. Just done differently. For one, the battle with Elle is a lot more comedic in tone but shot fantastically. And she doesn't really die, just gets a more poetic justice sort of end. And Elle kills Budd with a black mamba. But style just oozes from the Pai Mei stuff. Plenty of kung-fu creativity.It's really hard to explain why this movie works because it almost seems like a mess the way I'm describing it. I think one is more of a presence of Bill and Elle because they are both very good characters. I'd say the other thing is that even if it is more of a continuation rather than a sequel, it differentiates itself enough to feel fresh. Especially near the end it is more dramatic with the Bride's daughter being alive. And of course the western edge is also very different as well as the only person the Bride actually kills in this movie being Bill. But the end of the movie is also where some problems arrive. I thought the writing was great for Bill typically. Especially his thing about superheroes. But truth serum? Really? That has to be the dumbest thing in a Tarantino movie yet. And the actual fight that we have been waiting about 4 hours for lasts maybe 30 seconds. Although very well choreographed and suitably emotional, it is way too short. But on an overall scale, its a great sequel. It has all the visual flair, style, and fantastic musical choices of the first and keeps it fresh as well. Kill Bill Vol 2 gets a 9/10.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

The dialogues were nice and at same occasions excellent and the action was good, but not worth the good critics the movie has got.Now with part 2 I was even more disappointed than part 1. Once again this part was talked about of being the best movie ever made, but it was so boring that I almost fell asleep in the theatre (and that is only the first time that happened). Tarantino tries to make more of a story, but it is like 13 in a dozen. Take 10 movies at random from the videostore and changes are that 5 of them will have a similar story. The dialogues were interesting at their best. One nice thing was the music. That is one of Tarantino's strong points to select excellent music with the scenes in his movies.This was definitely the most boring movie I saw in the cinema the last 2 years.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
675,lasher42,A clearly defined second film,10,17 April 2004,"Having just completed a back-to-back comparison of the two volumes of Tarantino's Kill Bill, its clear that his two narrators have very different storytelling styles.  Kill Bill Vol. 1 was a tribute to the Kung-Fu films of the 70's and later, as told by Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba).  Blood, honor, and kung-fu style fighting were paramount.In Vol. 2, The Bride (Uma Thurman) narrates our story in the style of a ""Classic"" film.  There is more of a noir attitude and feel.  The violence is more realistic, and frequently implied instead of seen onscreen - a few graphic moments aside.The story is told wonderfully, in a more linear style, incorporating more flashbacks than out of order chapters.  Tarantino's direction is crisp, with impeccable acting by Thurman.  Daryl Hannah finally gets her moments in the sun, as our stunning villain.  While Bill (Carradine) may be the man behind the evil, Elle (Hannah) is the true evil villain, reveling in the destruction of her enemies.All in all, the two movies together tell a great story, and the stylistic differences clearly delineate between the two films.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Less action yes, but with it we get more depth. You still get your action scenes, the battle with Elle Driver has to be the standout, and ends in a very satisfying conclusion.The big dramatic scene of the burial is also gripping, and really needs to be appreciated at the cinema, rather than at home.I have also seen criticism of the amount of talk in the film, but when the words are those of Tarantino, surely this is unfair. The actors do a superb job with the material in most cases. Uma Thurman the standout in every scene she appears, with the possible exception of Chia Hui Liu as Pai Mei, who is nothing short of superb. Speaking as a UK viewer, the one thing that was grim for me, was the acting and script for the Bride's daughter. Attack of the sickly ""Spielberg"" child, if ever I saw one!Overall though, an excellent experience. Perhaps a little long in places, and the final killing of Bill, although maybe appropriate, may be short of the blood lust some may have craved.Well worth the viewing, whatever kind of film fan you are. 9/10.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Uma(The Bride), Caradine(Bill), Madsen(Budd), Hannah(Elle), Liu(Pai Mei), Parks(the old guy in the mexican whore house)and the brides daughter(very suhweet), has to be the perfect cast ever in a movie.

It's slow, it's practically mute, it relies heavily on music, it's nothing but a series of childish ideas, a comic strip, like the Coen movies, but they at least know how handle the genre. I think Tarantino understands the basic meaning of cinema (the burial scene proves that, with a totally dark screen and the slowly fading sound of earth falling on the coffin, a great scene). But Tarantino turns out to be rather superficial, as is proved by everything else and particularly by the total void of depth in either the story or the characters.

682,perfect_paradisiac,Tarantino's Return to the Art of Dialogue,9,5 August 2006,"The two things that Quentin Tarantino specialize in are action and dialogue. While Kill Bill Volume 1 had more than enough action to quell any action fan's hunger, Kill Bill Volume 2 is more dialogue based. In comparison to Kill Bill Volume 1, the story is slower, the events that take place happen much slower, and much more dialogue occurs throughout. (Although, Kill Bill Volume 2 does have its fair share of action, i.e. The Bride's confrontation with California Mountain Snake).The true beauty of this movie, like the first, is Tarantino's masterful blending of several film genres, (predominantly spaghetti-western and 70's kung-fu.) However, where the first one lacked in Tarantino-like dialogue, the second one fails to disappoint. From Pai Mei's words of wisdom during The Bride's training, to her final confrontation with Bill (and the verbal exchange that commences, particularly Bill's line about Superman comics) Tarantino fans that felt let-down at the lack of sharp dialogue from the first Kill Bill, should find plenty to rejoice about in this one.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Unfortunately, although still an extremely good film, Volume 2 doesn't hold a candle to the 1st.One film that he (Mr T) was 'pressurised' into chopping into 2..?

True, but one of the achievements of ""Vol. 2"" is that the story is filled in, the characters are developed, and they do begin to resonate, especially during the extraordinary final meeting between The Bride and Bill  which consists not of nonstop action but of more hypnotic dialogue and ends in an event that is like a quiet, deadly punch line.Put the two parts together, and Tarantino has made a masterful saga that celebrates the martial arts genre while kidding it, loving it, and transcending it.

And that being said - this movie is its exact opposite.At this point I've watched it twice, and I usually get a lot out of watching a relatively bad movie a second time, since I don't have any expectations it has to fulfill. Plus I get the possibility of getting an alternative perspective on it. But in this case even that did'nt help. Well, first of all the casting is horrible. If you gotta star Michael Madsen, star him at something he is good at. Hence being macho! In this movie he's a drunken excuse for an ex-pro-assassin, being dragged around the nose by his strip-club owner-boss, for whom he works as doorman or should I say doormat. Not cool, since Michael Madsen is a type-actor and nothing else! Secondly Darryl Hannahs performance as a mean, one-eye-patch assassin with a grudge is totally of the scale. And not in a good way! Most critics probably look right through this fact, because they think its intended on Tarantinos behalf, but if you ask me, you cant disguise poor acting, as a filmic visual intend, in relation to 70's blacksploitation movies, when its really nothing but poor acting. And thirdly David Carradine. He couldn't act in North and South and he sure can't act now. For what intend Tarantino drew him out of the closet, other than as a promotional stunt, I really cant see! There you have it. And thats just the cast. Will be back with more on the movie later. Sleep tight.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
687,MorganJones_33,LOL It's Hilarious,9,3 January 2007,"This was a very funny movie. I think that the way they make fun of the old Chinese, kung fu movies. And how could Pai Mei be any more funny than what he already is. Oh yeah, in kill bill 1 the crazy 88s ,or whatever they are called, after she beats them their arms and legs have all been cut off and they are squirming around. LOL! Then after that when she is fighting that Chinese girl, i forgot her name, at the end of the fight her scalp is flying through the air, then she is just like standing there. Then when Uma Thurman rips out that chick's eyeball with the patch, and she is freaking kicking around screaming and cussing. That was freaking awesome. I could go on but I'll stop. I think that it is a funny movie, but just not the same kind of funny as a lot of other movies.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
688,l33t_FX,Excellent yet lacking,8,16 April 2004,"I liked Vol 2 a lot.  While I was watching it in the theater I felt that I liked the second more than the first.  But now that I look back I don't like one more than the other.  I like the first one for the fight scenes, and the second one for the wonderful plot, the story was so great.  The only bit that was lacking was the fighting.  I was expecting elaborate grand finale sword fighting scenes; instead of Fire Works I was awarded with a Flash in the Pan.  The bride simply killed or disabled her opponents to fast.  I do believe that I liked the sound track to Vol 2 better.  I really enjoyed the back story of her training with Pai Mei.  I wouldn't have minded seeing even more of her training with her master.  Of course there was a purpose for it and QT had to keep the movie going.  Overall quite good.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
689,Rayvin,"7/10, but with a volume 1 bonus",6,27 April 2004,"Kill Bill Vol. 2 brings to an end what part 1 had started, but unfortunately in an a bit disapointing, because unsurprising way. Compared with Vol. 1 the second part has not much that you would not expect and is not able to impress as a movie by itself. It is a must for everybody who has enjoyed the first installment, but don´t wait for an enhancement. Especially the last bit is not much of an masterpiece, since the plot is brought forward in a pretty artless way. The movie lacks of the flair and atmosphere, which convinced many a couple of months again - not unexpected, but nevertheless not completely worthy.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
690,Gracioso,Amazing on many levels,10,20 April 2004,"***Minor Spoilers***I was absolutely floored by this movie.  When I wrote about Kill Bill Vol. 1, I wrote a lot about the themes (maternal, feminist, violence as catharsis, etc.), and neglected to also point out the sheer FUN of the movie.  That movie was themost enjoyable experience I've had in a theater in years.  Now that I've seen Kill Bill Vol. 2, I have to say that the bar for both levels of enjoyment have been raised.  Vol. 2 takes the motifs of the first movie and complicates them, making what was black and white in the first volume shades of gray.  We see villains with humanity, and we see the Bride grow to realize the weight of what she is doing.  Philosophically,  her journey becomes more and more complex as shenears its completion.  Where in the first movie, she could make the statement about revenge ""It seems irrefutable proof that not only does God exist, but you're doing his will,""  in the second that moral certainty is no longer so simple. The film ends with Bill's revelation--in two beautiful monologues--that she is no better than the ones she kills; She is a killer, and will never be able to hide from that.  She knows that she will have to suffer as much as the ones she kills, and that her actions may have incalculable consequences.  And she still does it, so committed is she to her goal.  All of that said, the movie is just plain fun to watch. Tarantino puts music, dialogue and images together to create such a cool effect that it is almost impossible to sit through the film without a great big goofy grin on your face.  The acting is phenomenal, the writing amazing, thecinematography (and old movie allusions) breathtaking. 10/10.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
691,mr_hk,boring ... and stupid,5,24 August 2004,"I like Kill Bill Vol. 1, but Vol. 2 is really boring. I can't believe how can this movie runs for more than 2 hours. It should be a 90 min. movie !Being a Chinese, I think the role of Pai Mei (Gorden Lui) is really stupid. Stupid in the way Gorden Lui acts; stupid in the way Gorden Lui talks. The conversation is really foolish, sounds like the master Pai Mei is an idiot. I have no idea how can Pai Mei put in the movie in such a stupid way, it only makes the movie laughable.Other acting are good. But it cannot save the movie. The movie is not fun at all (boring indeed !), especially when you compare Vol 2 with Vol. 1.I give Vol. 1 a vote of eight and Vol. 2 only five.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
692,waltsalvie,Modern homage to the Spaghetti Western,9,10 March 2005,"Kill Bill One was a homage to the old Samurai revenge classics. Many of the old martial arts movies including Bruce Lee's first few films focus on revenge being a emotional response to a injustice thereby revenge from Eastern thought is more of a out of control rage.Kill Bill 2 is Tarantino's homage to the Spaghetti Western. Revenge in Western thought should be more about justice and based less on emotion. As the tag line says ""Revenge is a dish best served cold"".Nothing is more ""Americana"" in movies than the western and Tarantino does a excellent job of blending the old West with Eastern culture in this film.The whole saga is about revenge, from Bill getting revenge on Kiddo to Kiddo avenging Pai Mai, the old saying holds true that what comes around goes around in this movie.Though not as violent as K.B. One the film does have some great fight's in it but more important are the characters and the lesson that revenge is a vicious cycle of cause and effect.This is a true modern western masterpiece from Q.T. with the focus that there is a fine line between revenge and justice.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
693,jnaniguy,By the Balls,10,18 April 2004,"Contains spoilers, but i mean, come on, if you've seen the trailer, you already know what im talking about.  No great surprises are ruined.Before i went to see Kill Bill: Volume 2, i would joke to my friends that i don't go to church, i go see Kill Bill in theaters, so when the second half of the movie came out, i felt compelled to see it as soon as possible.  It is my own version of a religious committment.  In order to put my own opinions on the second film in perspective, i need to explain what i thought of the first one, however.I am slightly biased, as Kill Bill: Volume One is one of my favorite types of movies.  It is a heroic epic of a sole character who needs to beat insurmountable odds to accomplish a relatively small task, and is only able to do this because of an inhuman amount of passion.  It is also a movie that is made not by the plot, the characters, the style, or anything really, except for these moments of intense power where you are completely awestruck by the force and power of the situations given to you.  I will not go into great detail on the movie itself, as if you are reading this you probably already know a lot about it.For a long while Kill Bill 1 was one of my favorite movies.And at first, second, third, and in fact all superficial glances, Kill Bill Volume 2 is a COMPLETELY different movie.  Gone are the Crazy 88 battle scenes, with warriors flying Yue Wu Peung style, gone is the barebone archetypical plotline, gone is the magic realist feel of a world gone backwards, and gone is the splaying blood infused gore.And what are we given instead?  Near the beginning of the film, The Bride is buried alive, which is strangely the same predicament that those who see the film are put into.  I am sure that Quentin has enough storyline on each of the 6 main assassins in this movie to make an entire series of movies at least as long as this one, and it is only in this movie that the sheer weight of all the deep, intertwining background history of this world falls on our heads.  Whereas Bill was seen merely as the enemy in the first one, in this movie he is The Bride's greatest foe, yet also her greatest freind, greatest lover, and ultimate father figure to the end.  All the main characters, in fact, are deeply and perosnally connected in a way that niether Vernita Green nor O-Ren Ishii seemed to be.
The amount of dialouge in this movie is almost unbelievable.  Almost.  The amount of action scenes is relatively non-existent compared to the first one.  But the ones that are there are completely pervasive.  The fact that they are diminished in number only increases their quality.This movie is, in fact, completely similar to Volume One.  It is, like the first one, a movie that depends entirely upon the instrumental, shockingly impactful singular moment.  I will not ruin any of these for you.  You will know them when you see them.The best way i can describe this movie in one sentence is a realization that i had midway through: ""This movie has me by the balls.""  No other movie has ever done that to me before.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
694,jdish,Boring - SPOILERS when it says (SPOILERS),3,17 April 2004,"Its been a while since i watched a movie in the theatres that i actually looked at my watch as much as i watched the movie. kill bill vol 1 was an actual decent movie for tarantino, it had laughs, great fight scenes and some decent dialogue. and i don't even like him that much. so obviously i came into kill bill vol 2 expecting to be blown away by great effects, great fight scenes, and good dialogue. well the only thing i got was DIALOGUE. it was like i was watching a woody allen movie without the humor. honestly there were some parts that i enjoyed but there was too much story telling. and another thing is that in the first one she had such a hard time getting to the people she wanted to kill and then the scenes were creative and well made.
in this one (SPOILERS) she doesn't even kill one of the people on her list and the fight scene with elle driver had little fighting and although the ending was creative it wasn't pleasing. and finally the death of bill was awful, we never even got to see this man fight he just dies by some BS technique. what a bore-fest 3/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
695,altimetermanswo,Great second half to an awesome story.,9,15 April 2004,"Tarantino continues this movie with what is now considered Tarantinoesque directing. He has almost cliched' himself and I love it. The camera work is as expected genius. Again the black and white scenes, and every move deliberate. Micheal Madsen is exactly what you would hope for, cheesy one liners like we all love. Carradine, looking every bit of 67 at times, surely didn't act like it. His acting and storytelling intriguing along with his smooth voice that just lures you in and makes you want to listen. Overall a 9, but not as much action as KB1, so if you are looking for that, just enjoy how the story comes together. The presentation I saw included a preview of Tarantino's next flick ""Hero"" which looked great also.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
696,mzombie33,A Movie For the Ages,10,19 April 2004,"Although volume 2 of this extravagantly excessive, indulgently fun endeavor is quite different than the first installment, it works undeniably well. Where volume 1 is a ridiculously gory thrillride paying homage to several of Tarantino's favorite movie subgenres (grindhouse martial arts flicks, 70s exploitation flicks, etc.) Volume 2, although containing some of these elements as well (including a spaghetti western type feel throughout) differs in that it is more plot driven and story focused.  Although some critics may suggest that Tarantino is too stubborn and excessive because of the incredibly elaborate plot elements that lie within volume 2 (the fifteen minute segment with The Bride training with martial arts master Pai Mei, and the unusually long intro) however, I dismiss the ramblings of these types of critics because every second of both movies are absolutely necessary as we see the plot come full circle.In volume 1 we get to witness Tarantino's visionary genius machismo at work and it is truly awe-inspiring, however, in Volume 2 Tarantino shows us that he is not simply a visual genius behind the camera, but that he can also weave quite a tale of intrigue as well.  Individually, each movie is stunning with that unforgettable feeling of ""coolness"" that have accompanied every other one of his films.  However, together, ""Kill Bill"" is a masterpiece.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
697,ujdur,Tarantino's worst = still a decent movie,6,19 August 2012,"I am reviewing both the volume one and volume two with this review as Kill Bill was meant to be a one 4 hour long movie. So when I give it a 6 out of 10, I am judging both the volumes as a whole. First I will say that I am one of Tarantino's biggest fans, I watched all his movies, I look for Tarantino's interviews online, etc. I think Jackie Brown is a masterpiece, as is Pulp Fiction, as is Reservoir dogs. But Jackie Brown was met with mixed reviews, some fans thought the movie was too mild for Tarantino, some were disappointed. This most likely hurt Tarantino on a personal level, ergo after a long pause from movie making he delivers the Kill Bill(s), the most childish of all his works. That is right, no question that Tarantino enjoyed himself making the movies, and no question that he made what he wanted to make. But, I have a feeling he decided to bend over to the masses with this one. Everything to please. And the masses loved it, I loved it (when I was 16). Kill Bill is still a decent movie, and if someone else made it I'd have given it 7, 8 or 9. But Tarantino can do better, he should do better. Luckily, he made Inglorious basterds which carried a true message in it, delivered with skill of an artist. Now he is making Django unchained, a controversial movie that may break his career. That is what the artist has to do if he wants to call himself an artist. To conclude with what I think Kill Bill is about. It is Tarantino's fantasy of what it would be like if the Blondie was a female in a relationship with Lee van Cleef working together in a band of assassins. Pretty infantile. There is a deeper theme of how revenge is a sin, and who has the right to decide who lives or dies, and who is really clean and good (no one) and who is evil. But I think he did this theme better in his other works. I think the movie that inspired Tarantino, Death rides a horse, is a better movie than Kill Bill. Tarantino is a genius, I love him.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
698,noomehtrevo,A Disappointment for Action Lovers and Tarantino Fans,5,17 April 2004,"Kill Bill: Vol. 1 was, by far, one of Tarantino's best.  With witty dialogue and tremendous fight scenes, Volume 1 was a delight for move-goers everywhere.So here we are.. Six months later, lined up outside theaters for hours on opening day to see what?  A lame script, lackluster action, and mediocre dialogue.  Not only was Kill Bill: Vol. 2 disappointing for action-fans, whose hopes were to see Volume 1's fight sequences matched and possible surpassed, it was a disappointment for Tarantino fans everywhere.  What was Quentin thinking?  A lousy and conclusion to a brilliant beginning.  It's hard to believe that it's being considered to merge these two movies into one.  Two hours into the extended release, there would be a cease in all action, and plot.Aside from 2 or 3 flashbacks, Volume 2 was in perfect chronological order. There was (in total, no exaggeration), about 10 minutes of good, actual fighting.  And the end?  It was just plain dull and ridiculous, even for an 80's B-movie.  Once again, I ask the question, what was Tarantino thinking? It seems our beloved writer/director has sold us out, as we were looking forward to more of what we had in Volume 1.  About 20 minutes into the movie I was skeptical as to what Tarantino had done, and watching some of the flashbacks from Volume 1 only made me miss watching it.  Hopefully Tarantino will be remembered for Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, and not this only-mediocre flick.  Thanks for nothing, Quentin.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

It's good to know there are still movie makers like Quentin Tarantino out there who make movies because they want to portray not just an idea but a lifestyle a line of work that can be had.

700,tr0n,I think I have fallen in love with this movie,10,22 April 2004,"I really do.The way everything is told, the contrast compared to the fist one, the originally, the recycling of old TV / movie styles into a new form. And the hidden ""movie fan"" stuff. Many people will not see it, but it's there. It just works and it works very, very well.I really loved the first one, but I have totally fallen in love with the second. Hard to explain why, it just made a big impact on me.And the soundtrack. Brilliant. It's not just that the music rocks, it's also how and when it's used in the movie. For example Ennio Morricone - L Arena or Malcolm Mclaren - About Her.Sweet, lovely, brutal, smart and just plain cool. Mr. Quentin, you've got a winner!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
701,Spider-man_2099,"Excellent movie, but nothing like the first one",10,16 April 2004,"This movie was fantastic.  However, for those of you who were only into the first one for the adrenaline rush, you may want to rethink seeing the movie. I myself loved this movie; it was perfect in every way that I can think of. However, there are about three fight scenes throughout the whole movie, and the death count in this movie will surely surprise most people.  Also, the backstories of the other members of the Deadly Viper Assassination squad aren't as fleshed out as O-Ren Ishii's, which was a slight disappointment, but they're implied well enough.  This second film is more about the emotions of the Bride than her ability to kick ass, and it is more a drama than an action film.  Thankfully, Tarantino knows how to make all sorts of great movies.  This one is extremely well done, and I urge you all to see it.  Just don't expect a crapload of action in this one.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
702,muscleman1,The greatest imagination in movie history,10,18 April 2004,"I believe that Tarantino probably has the greatest imagination in the history of film making.  Now some could argue that Spielberg and a few others are better directors(although not many), but no one could come close to creating the character development and bizarre stories that Quentin comes up with.  The cool thing is though, that he makes his bizarre and sometimes corny stories and details work with a mixed aspect of seriousness and timelessness that no one else can construct.  Kill Bill(1 and 2 together) is what I believe the greatest feat in film history.  This is because the movie has some of the funniest scenes ever, the coolest story, and the greatest action.  Despite their being few action scenes, the ones that he puts in the movie are by far the best I've seen.  The film is so great that it doesn't even have a true genre.  It is composed of everything: action, drama, comedy, suspense, thriller....  You name it, and he put it in there.  His films include sub-characters(GoGo,Mr.Blonde) that are remembered as much as some movies' lead roles, and the character of the Bride will probably be remembered years from now as well as Ripley from Aliens and Indiana Jones. This is also a credit to Uma.  So my hats off to Quentin Tarantino for achieving perfection.  Vol.1 didn't and Vol.2 probably won't take home the oscar, but it has to be the biggest cheat in movie history.Kill Bill(1&2) 13/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
703,Mccrd,Should have been one movie.,6,16 April 2004,"It's three in the morning (opening day) and I just saw the movie.  I must say I'm a little bit disappointed.  Now before I go any further, the acting, character, and dialogue are on par, and in some cases better than Volume 1. This movie is very different from the last one though as it is hardly an action film.  There are 3 (I think) 1-on-1 fights, none of which last more than five minutes.  Plus, there is virtually no swordplay at all.  Now, for an over two hour long action film, that's not exactly what you'd expect. Now this is fine, because the drama in this film is incredible.  Great dialogue, deep characters, and pretty good acting is what makes it worth watching.  But here also inlies the movies main problem, vol 1 & 2 shouldn't be seperate films.  If you ask me, they should be combined into a 3 1/2 hour long epic.  While vol. 1 did pretty well on it's own as a stand alone movie, 2 doesn't.  The pacing is absolutely horrid and makes it kind of chop along from scene to scene.  I was actually frustrated by the end.  I wont watch these again unless they are released re-edited together, the way they should have been (before money scamming became an issue).",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
704,aeternitas_adamo,As a whole great film by itself quite boring,9,18 April 2004,"Although this film has some very entertaining parts such as the Pai Mei sequence and other bits and pieces throughout but I have to say the dialogue which is Tarantios specialty is very lacking here , instead of being hilarious conversations most of it consists of David Carradine going on long metaphorical monologues which were neither funny nor intresting and proceeded to bore the hell out of me . Now to all those who say the second is more tarantino like and fans of the old movies who didnt like volume 1 will enjoy it I say No way in hell like i said alot of the dialouge is very weak and is infact noway as witty or insightful conscerning backstory as his otherfilms and I gotta say I was very disappointed .

Uma is perfect as The Bride, and David is awsome as bill. The rest of the cast is just so good! There is less violence but more dialogue, precious dialogue. You will love the action.

What were you thinking man? This is 1st year film student stuff. I watched this last night with my partner. We were hard pushed to stay awake! Neither of us could believe just how s-l-o-w this film was. The story could have been told in less than 15 minutes!! What gets my goat is that you took 15 minutes-worth of story, blew it out of all proportion, and then sold it to us poor slobs as a fitting sequel to KB1. Man, I have lost a lot of respect for you.Oh, and before you other losers on here give me a hard time about ""The Art"" or that ""Action isn't everything"", get a grip! This film didn't have any art and bog-all action!! It had no substance. It did not ""Grab you"" and make you want to stay in your seat.

707,jsibley,Nothing like the first one,4,19 April 2004,"Volume 1 was fantastic.  The characters were great, the action sequences were artistically conceived and stylish, and even the editing and pacing of the movie were excellent.  Not so with Volume 2.  Pai Mei is the only really new character, and while he is the highlight of the movie, his scenes don't last long at all.  There is very little action, almost nothing stylish or unique, and the pacing was agonizingly slow.  It slowly builds up to a very disappointing ending with almost no pay-off for sitting through some really terrible dialogue coming from Bill and the Bride.  Bill especially seems like a mouthpiece for Tarantino's inner monologue, which would be fine if Bill was supposed to be like Tarantino in any way, but that's a little difficult to believe.  In short, why on earth would Bill be reading comic-books?  Despite all that, there are some things I liked about this movie, such as the interesting characters and director's attention to details and sense of humor.  If this were a stand-alone movie I would give it 7 stars.  Having seen the first one though, I drop it to 4 out of sheer disappointment.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

709,halo_fourteen,Completing the birth of a legend,8,21 April 2004,"The second part to this film has probably been one of my most anticipated moments in cinema of the last year at least (par Shaun of the Dead) and with good reason. The first came out with such a bang that it's hard to ignore, and you can't help yourself, but to want find out what could drive The Bride to kill so many people so violently. And yes, nearly all your questions will be answered (I do say nearly though). They may not always be the answers you were hoping they were going to be, (but this is Quentin Tarantino - when has he ever been one to go with the flow?) however as the story unravels in it's infamously non-chronological order, it all comes together.After getting a severe beating from Budd, you begin to learn more about the Bride's past with Bill and Pai Mai, and this becomes a segnificent domino effect to how the twists in the plot are going to unravel and lead you into many moments of you thinking, ""ah, that's clever"". A few more excellent fight scenes (especially with Elle Driver), although the death and gore count is substantually less than Volume 1. However this is made up for.It sometimes feels that Volume 1 and 2 are completely different films given the first finished so violently and to the very maximum that you have to allow the film to slow down ""before this tale of bloody vengence reaches it's climax"" according to Bill. Volume 2 kind of takes on a new plot as it's more about answering questions and discovering the meaning behind what is now a legend. If you were to watch this film as a single piece, as it was originally meant to be, then nothing is going to compare to the House of Blue Leaves scene (in other words, all the action gets over and done with) but your eyes will be peeled with awe at discovering the truths. So it's a double edged sward (excuse the pun) between action and the fantastic Tarantino script lacking from the first Volume.Performances were astounding by everyone, and this goes without saying to be Uma Thurman's greatest roll to date. David Carradine is just the greatest villan in recent film history.A few unanswered questions, such as why did Bill initially still want The Bride dead (when Elle tries to kill her in a coma) when he admits to regretting shooting her in the first place (true, he does abort the mission, but whether he was just telling Elle to calm down for B.B.'s sake or he wanted to actually kill her when she woke up becomes more of a mystery later on).Generally though a satisfactory ending and combined with Volume 1, this will be one of the greatest films of the decade.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

How can you not, at the very least, be entertained?V2 was certainly slower than the first and a bit condescending to the audience.  The ""lessons"" learned - it was an action packed psycho love story if you will.  Casting was superb - I haven't a clue as to how Uma Thurman pulled this off being that she is so tall and lanky - but she did - and she did it better than anyone.

711,johnny_snoops,BURIED ALIVE!!,10,19 April 2004,"I can take gore. I can take extreme violence. Hell, I can take graphic sex and masochism. BUT, the scene where Budd buries 'The Bride' is the most disturbing thing I have ever seen. I know it's been done before, but QT did such a great job of communicating the claustrophobic feeling of being in a casket underground. I couldn't bare to listen to the dirt falling on the thing!Really though this drives home my 'point'. This is the most masterfully acted movie I have ever seen. Ever. Uma Thurman gives us a real feeling of how any of us would react in that situation. Total fear, isolation and helplessness. I have never felt so claustrophobic in a giant room full of people. On a side note, when Elle (Hannah) gets her eye plucked by the vengeful bride her screams began an incredible onslaught on me. It was the most convincing portrayal of a person in mortal pain that I will (can) ever see. Absolutely blood-curdling. It must be said however, these are just two of the reasons I LOVE this movie!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Yes, I realize that it really is ONE film, but when seperated as two, one ultimately must be better. Now, I find the first one to be friggin' amazing, but in an entirely different way. It's comic-book in its wicked cool style and action, as well as crazy awesome humour, but does that make it better? The second is so powerful, and admitidly, I was near tears in the B.B. scene. Yes, yes, they are both great movies... but help me out here...which one kills? (Oh, and by the way...why didn't she kill blindy Mcgee there? Elle, I mean. Will she come back for her own, blind and stumbling revenge? Or will she repeatedly trip over things until her own snake bites her?)",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
713,tommytom,The finale to the opus of revenge...,10,19 April 2004,"While this film is much different than the first part it resolves in great form. This second movement to Tarintino's opus is more plot driven than the first parts multiple fight scene, which in some cases last over twenty minutes. We learn the past of the bride and more about the circumstances of her apparent 'death'. This second part really shines in its story telling ability, the actors are faithfully able to show us the extent of their emotions without saying a word. This is by far one of Tarintino's best, while it is not 'Pulp Fiction' the quality of the acting and the quality of the script are all there. While this movie will most likely be snubbed at the Oscars because of its release date, I truly hope voters will look at this film as one of the 'truest' movie of 2004.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

The story lines, the background information on the Bride, as well as the other Vipers, answered so many *important* questions I had after seeing Vol. 1, that I..... I can't even describe this movie. Just... see it... now. Right now. We just got back about 10 minutes ago and I'm still giddy and lacking any vocabulary a normal functioning adult should possess. There are a few minor goofs, like the Bride's hair length and the calendar in the titty bar, but those are rather minor and just add to the enjoyment of watching this film. It is our considered opinion that the six step thing is not a goof, but rather a show of strength, so y'all can just hush right up about that. Quentin and Uma.... Thank You.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
715,jontysidgwick,perfection,10,27 April 2004,"i, like everyone else, had high expectations for this film, having adored the first one. For a start, this is a very different film, and i had realised that was going to be the case from early after seeing vol.1, and i was first in line to see the second part.I gotta say, this film is sheer perfection.sure, its not as action packed as the first one, but so what, action doesn't make a film good, in fact, its often the opposite. Vol.2 is more intelligent, witty, funny, and emotional than the first. now, i though the first film was a perfect film, but this takes the cake. the great post modern inclusions of the truth injection, and the five point palm exploding heart technique were fantastic.This film is not only, by far, Tarantino's best, its also one of the best films ever made. a more than worthy sequel to the first slice of perfection cake, that was vol.1.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
716,beenerz,Bang!,9,18 April 2004,"Volume 1 was nifty.  The world and the characters Tarantino set up were intriguing.  The pastiche of genres was darn cool.  The camera work was phenomenal.  The violence got to be a bit much at times (as if T was sitting around, scratching his head and saying: ""where can i make blood spurt out of now?"").  But the coolest things about Vol. 1 were the tantalizing hints of back-story.Volume 2 makes good on the promise of the first, and may actually be the better movie.It's different.  There's not so much screentime devoted to gore.  The style shifts aren't so abrupt.  It's actually more cohesive and more-or-less linear.  The characters are phenomenal, as are the actor who portray them.
Above all of this, it's a wonderfully done anti-hero picture.  The moral ambiguity is absolutely delicious.  I think Buddy sums it up best when he says that they deserve to die--but so does she.  So... shrug.  We'll see. As surreal and stylized as the movie is, the characters seem very real and honest, and just weird enough to charm your socks off.
Finally, Tarantino deserves some major credit for digging Carradine out of the depths of obscurity for this movie.  If you consider how much of this movie rested on a title character who got very little screentime, you'll see why it was so important that Carradine made the part of Bill his own.Chalk me down as a non-Tarantino-fan who really enjoyed this movie.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
717,own2feet2140,"Different than Vol.1, but still Tarantino",8,17 April 2004,"I must say that where Vol. 1 pumped me up with it's fast paced homage to bloody decapitating action, Vol. 2 had a whole other vibe similar to that of the Pulp Fiction flavor. I read a review where the critic complained that Vol. 2 is not as good as Vol. 1 and that it's simply Tarantino being ""self indulgent"". I disagree. I don't believe that audiences will be getting a film that out-does the first. However, what they will be getting is a whole other movie, which stands on it's own. While Vol 1. was shocking, Vol. 2 is more sultry and bitter sweet. Where Vol. 1 started you off with the champion of all catfights, Vol. 2 starts you off with a drawn out dramatic scene which builds the tension to a crescendo. You get a truthful look of the girl inside the badass warrior, as well as the man who loved her so much, he had to put a bullet in her head. Although, I was disappointed that the long awaited showdown with the title character was more talk than swordplay. It would have been even more disappointing if Tarantino would have simply created a carbon copy, ""more of the same"" from the first installment. And when it comes to talk, Tarantino is the the master. His collaboration with David Caradine in the creation of the ""Bill"" character is one of the greatest of all time. Bill is charming, using subtle tricks and tactics to derail the Bride's rampage of revenge. Tarantino stretches his directing muscle by holding back some of his old techniques and using new ones to give you an original film and not just a sequel. Uma Thurman gives the acting performance of her career, worthy of the Oscar she was nominated for in Pulp Fiction. David Caradine is better than ever, and Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen give much stronger performances than was ever expected from them.

718,amanbz,Tarantino Strikes Gold Again!,8,3 June 2004,"Once again Quentin Tarantino has released a masterpiece. Though not as violent and action packed as Volume 1, Volume 2 offers the a more story like movie, but with a sufficient amount of action. The plot thickens as the story unfolds and the viewer begins to understand the mysterious incident between The Bride (Beatriz Kiddo) and Bill. You get the sense of a little kung-fu training with Pai Mei, but you still get that Tarantino retro feel with some tasteful gore. The ending has some excellent suspense as you are on the edge of your seat (No spoiler for those who did not see the movie) constantly waiting to see what will happen next. Tarantino never fails to add suspense to his films. Even though I loved this film I felt it lacked the action that I enjoyed some much in Volume 1, but nevertheless a fantastic film, just a notch short of Volume 1.

719,tegucigalpa17,Entertaining and Great,10,16 April 2004,"Quentin Tarantino commonly makes great films. However, you didn't know what to think with Kill Bill Vol. 1. It was a great action film, but at times became tired. There was no great dialogue as you come to expect from Mr. Tarantino. However, this film gives you everything that you want. It is a good thing that he split it into two films, because after you get to see his masterpiece of action experimentation, you get to the great stuff, with the dialogue. Also, Budd and Elle Driver are much better characters than Vernita Greene and O-Ren Ishii. This movie is great.

However, if your interested in the actual feelings of the characters, this provides plenty more. Overall though, as a story on its own, I'd say this isn't anything remarkable, and I think if it is incredibly acclaimed it's because of Tarantino's acclaim. Ultimately though, if you buy both the DVDs, I think being able to watch polar ends of a movie from the absence of conscience to the desperation at motherhood-- it is a pleasant thing to watch. But once again, even in that way, I'd say this is a pretty good movie, just nothing awe-inspiring, like Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs.

Kill Bill Volume 1 was so over the top, so over stylish, and oh so very good that I had to doubt myself if Volume 2 could live up to the first. Now granted, we all know (or should, before basing judgment) that this is really one long movie, essentially chopped in half. The first half being action and set up, the second half being the conclusion and character building. I was relieved to find the second half being what I just said. The directing by QT just goes to show that he has to be one of the finest writers and directors of our time. The dialouge in and QT movie, in my opinion, sets his flicks apart from the rest, and he does not disappoint here. The finest part being the ladder of the film, with the conversations between The Bride and Bill. Also here is something we aren't too accustomed to from a QT movie... sentiment. I couldn't help but smile as I left the theater. All things considered, from the few action scenes, to the beautiful scenery, to the well-written script, KB 2 more than lives up to the reputation that the first movie set.

722,Aevora,Quentin Tarantino's raging revenge story draws to a close!,10,18 April 2004,"Warning: This review might contain minor spoilers, but I'll try to keep them as low as possible. ~ Aevora.K I L L   B I L L   V O L . 2Yesterday it was crunch time. In a completely sold out cinema I was going to watch the sequel of what I thought to be one of the best movies ever. First Kill Bill Vol.1 was shown, then a break and finally it was midnight and Kill Bill Vol. 2 was about to be shown.While the movie was playing, I didn't move. I didn't wink and I almost forgot to breath. I was so amazed. This was such an unique movie, and it was great on both a 'nice story'-level as an artistic level. When the credits came rolling, I was shaking and I was totally convinced: Kill Bill vol.2 is not only better than Vol. 1, it is one of the best movies I've ever seen.And that quite surprised me. After seeing Vol. 1 with ultra-cool Gogo Yubari and classy, stylish O-Ren I did not think that QT could ever surpass the quality and intensity of that movie. I did look forward to Vol. 2 but was afraid to be disappointed. I was so wrong. Not only do Budd and Elle Driver overdo the coolness of Vernita Green and O-Ren Ishii, they actually are able to be even cooler as Gogo Yubari.Vol.2 is a lot less violent and it is one big pack of dialogue. But the dialogue is so stunning, that you're not even disappointed that there's not so much violence in it. The action that does appear in the movie is outrageous and just great. As an effect of all these dialogues, you get sympathy for The Bride and even for Bill. The dialogues are never too long or too complicated, because there is always some action intwined with it.As The Bride comes closer and closer to the mindbreaking climax of the film, there are a couple of extraordinary scenes in the film. I will try not to spoil anything, but Pai Mei's training, the Paula Schultz thing and Budd and Elle in the trailer are certainly one of the best scenes there ever were in a movie (people who have already seen this movie know what I'm talking about).I don't think that QT could ever have used a better cast for this film. Uma Thurman shows that she act everyone of the screen as she plays a mother, a killer, a revengeful Bride and a lover. On top of that, each different side of her character is so well worked out by Uma that I think there might be an Oscar for her. Not to forget David Carradine. He plays Bill as such a mindless killing machine with a heart, that you think he is playing a double role, but it's just a piece of excellent acting. Michael Madsen is Budd and I wonder if the role is written for him. If not, Madsen could also be in the running for some awards. I was never a fan of Daryl Hannah. I thought she was kind of annoying. But I have to admit that she was sexy as ever and a great actress for the role of Elle Driver. At least one award for her. Keep an eye out for double roles by Gordon Liu and Michael Parks cause they are great. I really need to see this movie one more time to discover every little hidden detail that were also in Vol. 1.Conclusion: Fans of Kill Bill Vol. 1 are bound to go to this one, cause it's by far better than Vol. 1. If you found Vol. 1 a little over-the-top violent I suggest you just try out this one. You'll probably be amazed by the great storyline QT has written. The cast is great, the action is amazing and the storyline is stunning. I've got a A+ for Kill Bill: Vol. 2!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
723,agentorange_clementine,Why a disappointment?,8,27 April 2004,"The most important thing that can be said about Kill Bill Volume Two is that it doesn't quite live up to expectations built up from the incredible Volume One.  But that isn't to say that the movie isn't something special anyway. If you like Quentin Tarantino, and in particular, enjoyed the first volume of Kill Bill, then you will want to see this movie again and again.
*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*The film is completely different to the first, with dialogue taking over from violence (though we still get some fabulous fight scenes-The Bride's showdown with Elle shouldn't be missed by anyone!), and unfortunately, unlike with other Tarantino films, this dialogue can drag at times.  When the Bride finally gets to Bill, don't expect The House of Blue Leaves-you will be disappointed.  Some parts of the final confrontation are fantastic, but some will leave you itching for the story to just move along already. Emotion takes over, and whereas in the first movie, the Bride is portrayed as someone looking for cold, heartless revenge, (the scene with Vernita Green's daughter proving this), the character seems to do a complete turnaround.  At the time it seems a little annoying, but with the addition of the Bride and Bill's daughter to the equation, it does make sense looking back.  The last line of Volume One, in which Bill asks `Does she know her daughter is still alive?' was impeccable, and added a fresh twist to a very linear story up to that point.  The moment when the Bride finally learns the truth is one of the most perfect moments of Volume 2, leading up to Bill and the Bride's final confrontation.   And despite the seemingly endless amount of Superman talk, this confrontation is still fascinating for the most part, even it doesn't quite live up to expectations rendered from the first movie.
Other parts of the movie however, do really give us a reason to treasure Kill Bill.  The scenes where the Bride is being trained by Pei Mei (a great and often hilarious performance by Gordon Lui) are fantastic, as is Chapter Six where we learn more about the day of the wedding rehearsal massacre-shot beautifully in black and white.  The scenes where the Bride is being buried alive are surely the best of the movie though-the direction is amazing, making the audience feel everything the Bride is feeling.  Even when the screen is nothing but black, you are entranced by what is happening. These are the scenes you leave thinking about, and which make you realise that even when Quentin Tarantino is not at the very top of his game (the level which Kill Bill Volume One achieved) it is probably impossible not to adore him anyway.
Unlike Volume One, performances really need to be at top level in this movie, due to the much extended use of dialogue.  And on the whole, they achieve this.  Special mention must go to Michael Madsen (Budd) who possibly put in the performance of his career, despite the rather small amount of screen time.  David Carradine was immense as Bill, as was Uma Thurman (the Bride) though at times, Miss T struggled slightly with lengthy amounts of dialogue.  Finally, Darryl Hannah was a revelation as Elle, conveying pure evil in everything she uttered.   Hopefully, Kill Bill will be the beginning of a big revival for her.
Kill Bill Volume Two is a slight disappointment, but only in the highest sense of the word.  On it's own, it would probably be regarded as a classic, but it suffers from being in the shadow of it's predecessor.  As a result of the film being split into two parts, a lot of Volume Two seems to be padded out to fill time which is a shame.  But it still deserves 4/5.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

In that way I thought of part 1 as kind of boring (to much action can really bore me). Part one also lacked the cool characters and conversations I expect in a Quentin Tarantino movie. Part 2 (Vol. 2) totally makes up for that! ..It is the right blend of action and story. Just like part one it can go quite ""over the top"" sometimes (a bit like desperado), but being the style of this movie I consider it cool. Uma really shines too.

However, we were checking our watches during several talky scenes, especially when David Carradine was droning on. And. On. In. His. Very. Portentous. And. Halting. Way.  And what has happened to Michael Parks?  He was such a cutie in his younger years, and now he's a character actor playing a dried-up 80-year-old pimp. However, it must be acknowledged that he gives a gem of a performance.On the plus side, it's not as bloody or gory as I feared (I didn't see KB-1) due to the comic-book style.  At times this comic-bookness seemed like a cop-out, providing an easy out for things like, how can someone get shot point blank with a double barrel shotgun and not have to deal with a cavern in their chest -- or at the very least the embedded buckshot.  Clearly, the director is so in love with the images and the IDEA of the film, that he loses the plot and structure of the actual film we are watching.  I mean, really, how many people were clamoring for an homage to martial arts films? And how many really needed a sequel to the homage?

726,wayne-eden,Miramax & QT are vindicated,10,28 April 2004,"Having seen comments on vol 1, accusing Miramax and Tarantino of blatant profiteering by releasing KB in two parts, it's great to see vol 2 answering those critics with aplomb.  Vol 2 is such a different film from its predecessor, and for that reason works wonderfully.  As one film, such contrast would have been impossible!  Okay, I was a little skeptical about the decision myself, but am I glad it became two movies!KBV2 is a treat.  Vol 1 seemed to lack plot.  Vol 2 brims with it.  Okay, the dialog still doesn't burn like vintage-QT (I felt the Superman thing, although entertaining, was shoe-horned in and seemed incongruous with Bill), but you sense he's trying his hand at something else entirely. Uma's performance is fantastic, David Carradine's, even better. The supporting players aren't half bad, either. In particular, Gordon Liu as Pai Mei, the vindictive Kung Fu master, is hilarious - never has insane laughter coupled with vigorous beard-stroking been done so stylishly on the cinema screen!
As for the denouement, I loved it.  A noble and delightful end to a fantastic, stylish, and exhilarating ride.  Go and see it, even if vol.1 didn't float your boat - it may just make you reevaluate the whole thing.
And now a line from vol 1: ""It was not my intention to do this in front of you. For that I'm sorry. But you can take my word for it, your mother had it comin'. When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it, I'll be waiting.""There's the sequel, right there.  Can't wait...",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Anyone just out for gore should avoid this one. Sorry to you bored, bloodthirsty multitudes!  you have to listen to people speaking! Gasp!

It really does look like layers of soft plywood when Pai Mei punches through it... Did they have to do that to make it technically possible for the actor to punch his fist through it, or are we supposed to draw the conclusion that Pai Mei was cheating and just trying to test Beatrix (i.e. nobody would have been able to punch through the blocks she's faced with and he's just trying to gauge her will to continue with the training)?",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
731,tnnick77,To anyone who has anything negative to say.,10,9 May 2004,"I would like to comment on Kill Bill: Volume 2.  I was surprised to see a few other users commenting about this film negatively.  Although entitled to their opinions, I feel that they do not show this second volume any justice. First of all, Kill Bill: Volume 2 is equally as excellent as Kill Bill: Volume 2.  There is simply a different atmosphere, to a degree.  Your enjoyment of the film is what you make it.  Tarantino finds it necessary to show a considerable amount on Budd, but I do not see how it slows the movie down.  Kill Bill: Volume 1 has fast-paced parts and slow-paced parts, as well.What most people do not understand is that although this is a revenge movie, there should be no major issue about sympathy or empathy with the Bride. The issue, rather, is WHY she is doing what she is doing.  Unless you are involved completely in the life as an international assassin who is among a social group of outstanding martial arts experts who are assassins themselves, you cannot begin to understand the complexities involved.  The Bride and her enemies have totally different mindsets than the average commoner in society.  The Bride's issue is ""kill or be killed"" and as mentioned within Kill Bill: Volume 1, all human emotion and compassion are compressed within a warrior's mind.  Things happen in this world that are right and that are wrong.  If someone wipes out a person's family, two wrongs don't make a right, but that is beside the point in these movies. It is arguable that just there is a time for peace, love, sadness, war, famine, etc., there is a time to fight...and yes, a time to kill.
Finally, Tarantino is telling a story in HIS very own unique and brilliant manner.  I myself felt sympathy with the Bride in Volume 1, but I feel that that was not Tarantino's goal, so that is merely a side effect.  The movies seemed to be different simply because of the EMPHASIS on different characters.  Each Death List Five character has a different amount of emphasis...so any issue of HOW LONG TARANTINO DECIDED TO STRESS A CHARACTER'S PERSONAL STORY is irrelevant and unnecessary.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

It was everything Van Helsing tried to be, and failed miserably at actually doing.This movie isn't really very original. And in this case I don't mind. QT has put his love and knowledge of films into this two part epic and it shows. He has a deft touch and knows how to get good performances from his cast, which were all perfect for their parts.I really can't find a flaw with the film, other than the lack of originality. That is not to say that QT did not put his own personal spin on things, or that this movie was a ""creation."" But it is a master work of synthesis, combining things not usually found together into a nearly seamless whole.If one is a QT fan this film is a must see. If you loved old westerns, Japanese Anime, Honk Kong Cinema (and/or Kung Fu films in general) this is a must see. If you want to see something that will seem very familiar at times, but still challenge you, this is a must see.If you don't like gore, violence, ""adult situations"" or foul language, stay away.I got to watch the DVD then go see the film the next day, I recommend this, and I am looking forward to owning both Kill Bill DVDs.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
733,kennethchwong-428-864394,Kill Bill vol 2 is a passionate work from Tarantino,9,3 June 2014,"Kill Bill vol 2 is a passionate and thought-provoking movie. Building on Kill Bill vol 1, the themes of bloody revenge, self-dignity,life and death and persistence are further demonstrated. The flow of the movie is well-paced with the use of chapters, the movie gives you a sense of classical Japanese comics. The arrangement of chapters also allow events to be displaced in a sequential order rather than a chronological order.There are many excellent quotes in the movie such as Kiddo's dialogs in the beginning of the movie showing her determination to ""Kill Bill"" and Bill's analogy of superman as to Kiddo as a natural born killer. In addition, the soundtracks of the movie is extraordinary. The soundtracks contains the element of western instruments and eastern melancholy tones, both effectively added suspension to the scenes. My favorite scene of the movie is where Kiddo plucked out Elle's eyeballs, in particularly when she destroyed her eye by stepping on it recklessly. The is the scene which gives me the strongest emotional stimulation of how powerful revenges can be. Furthermore, something i liked about vol 2 is where Kiddo's daughter comes into the scene. This gives a full explanation of why the whole massacre had happened. The scene where BB attempt to ""kill"" her mom with a toy gun, further reflects the nature of killing and life and death through the mind of an innocent and pure kid. After-all, is there any good reason for killing when even a child understands killing is not justifiable. This wraps everything well by bringing out people's regret and guilt after killing every single people!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
734,andreascaspersen,A fantastic follow-up to a middle-rated vol.1,10,8 June 2004,"Kill Bill vol.2 is nothing less than a masterpiece, and deserve to be rated just as high as pulp fiction and reservoir dogs. It is a true Tarantino movie with the fantastic dialogues and sceneries of his earlier movies. It is so wonderfully stuffed with spaghetti-western environment, kung-fu fighting. And just plain kick-ass characters performed by Michael Madsen in his best part since reservoir dogs, Darryl Hannah in her best part ever, and David Carradine has never ever played a character close to his performance in kill bill. An over-all rating must be 10+, and that is considerably more than I would give to Kill Bill vol. 1, which is one of Tarantino's weakest movies.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
735,The_Walking_Holocaust,Ying and Yang,9,14 June 2004,"Kill Bill volume two, in my book is the superior of the two films. One must remember that this is meant to be one large film, so it must be analyzed with the first one in mind. This film to me acted as a foil for the first one, It's ying to the other's yang. The first one was a beautiful flower of death, as the bodies piled up the flower blossomed and film became an action epic. The second one feels more like a Tarantino film because it focus more on the conversations and the interactions between characters rather than the overall violence. If we were to put both films together it would be easier to see that one section must be violent and the other must be calm.It's like comparing ""Friday the 13th"" to ""Halloween."" Both are iconic films in the horror industry, both being the slashers that are ruthlessly copied. Friday, has a large body count, as with all the sequels. Halloween was more subdued and had a smaller body count. I preferred the latter albeit both movies are great.There are many scenes in this film that are very memorable, and I'd rather not give them away.The film has a spaghetti western feel to it, especially with the music and the locations in the film. it's a much lighter film with a good dash of comedy. Tarantino is very imaginative behind the camera as he usually is, providing unique angles to convey even the simplest of events.In the end those who like action will like the first one and those who like conversation will prefer the second one.Kill Bill as a whole is the closest thing I have ever seen to my dream movieThe Glengarry Glen Ross meets The crow",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
736,huugh,bullshit,1,23 July 2004,"Unfortunately I have seen this and I want to warn you, don't watch it! Totally dumb, boring piece of s**t, piteous acting, imbecile plot (actually NO plot presence in this crap) and all the time worse than Hong-Kong action movies from 70s. Volume 1 was quite good, nothing exceptional but watchable without hazarding with your health, imho this vol.2 was extended to 2hours just for money-making just when from whole story left about 5 lines in screenplay of volume 1, so why don't make sequel, a lot of little green papers will become handy just for nothing, what a deal! So don't wonder about 5 and more minutes long monologues over lying (and probably dying) enemy, what should probably symbolize that there is something like a plot behind 5 year old kiddies would make a better movie Quarantino's worst movie, actually worst movie I have ever seen",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
737,anotherpatsn,super bad,1,19 July 2004,"I've never seen a worse sequel in my life. This movie is so boring and shitty it made me wish I was watching The Talented Mr. Ripley. The tiresome attempts of Bill's assassins getting to Uma are about the same as the coyote after the road runner. You know it's just not going to happen. All you know is that Uma will kill Bill. And I expected it to be ten times better than when Uma took on Oren-Ishii. instead I felt let down by Quentin Tarantino for the first time ever. And yes I have seen Jackie Brown. I think it's a damn good movie. But you just have to a fan of Shaft and Superfly, Foxy Brown, and that type of s**t. Kill Bill vol. 2 was like church to me unfullfilling and an utter waste of time and money. I could have spent a Friday night watching a Twins game or something worth while. Perhaps even PAINT DRYING!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
738,tapatriarca,Just because it sounds cool! Does not a good movie make,1,15 September 2004,"OK This film really was the pits! VOL 1 didn't impress but wasn't a total loss. Tarrantino wanted to make the COOLEST kung fu flick ever with kick ass fight sequences (none of which even come close to Ang Lee's operatic action in crouching tiger) Vol 2 however has a bunch o f awful monologues trying to out cool each other. this isn't anything new for a tarrantino flick but they generally had a purpose in his other films.QT gives you style, no substance and whole lot of terrible acting.(known for resurrecting careers but nailing the coffin on darryl hannahs here.)QT was looking for a vehicle to throw in as much cool things as he could get out of his pop cultured stew of a brain.In other words if your a 15 year old boy this will be the best film you have seen in your life.The rest of us will be thanking god there is no vol 3.I heard tarrantino abandoned a war film project to make this dribble would much have preferred to see that.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
739,bart_NL,Did not live up to my expectations,4,10 November 2004,"After seeing Kill Bill 1, I was thrilled to see the sequel. When I finally saw it, I have to say I was a bit disappointed by it.I'll give a few reasons: In part I the person 'Bill' is a complete mystery, which makes the movie attractive till the end. In part 2 this mystery is directly unfolded in the opening scene; to my opinion this could have been done with a lot more tension and excitement to keep the viewer tight to the screen. The second thing is the plot which is to my opinion too predictable and has only a few weird twists and turns. Last point I have is the length of the movie. It takes 136 minutes to finish, while with this storyline it could be done in about an hour.I like Tarantino-movies, but this one certainly lacks quality.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
740,tbumber,fantastic!!!,10,18 January 2005,"When I first saw kill Bill vol. 1 I was so pleasantly surprised because first of all, I didn't expect I would like a Tarantino movie that much (this movie turned me into a big fan of QT!!) and second of all, that underneath this bloody, feisty plot is a great story about a great woman that is so strong and in the same time so warm, which might not be noticeable in vol. 1. The next day I bought Kill Bill soundtrack because the music swept me away, and I couldn't wait vol. 2 to come out. In a way I was afraid what to expect... WOW!!!! The biggest dilemma after seeing it was:"" which one I like better?"" Than I realized i DON'T HAVE TO DECIDE AT ALL. Volume 2 is all about knowing the Btide, understanding her reasons which were'n trivial at all. Music is just as good, Michael Madson, Gordon Liu, Michael Parks as s Mexican pimp... WOW! Everybody were fantastic! QT created a new world in this movie and everything makes perfect sense in it, nothing is strange (not even to me, until now, a complete kung-fu ignorant), whatever a person does, we understand, we can relate. You can even start to feel this deep connection between Bill and the Bride. The scene of his death is absolutely beautiful and again, makes perfect sense. This is a story about great women in kinky situations. I strongly recommend it. I LOVE it!!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
741,MISSMASS,Do Not watch this movie!,5,1 February 2005,"This film picks up right where Volume 1 left off where the bride finds the other remaining assassins and Bill. Despite that the fact that the first one was so-so and highly enjoyable, once the second half came out and we saw it: It was better than the first one, NOT! Just when critics were rating this film with good reviews just like the first one they gave a bit of warning that it was changed from the drama/action to the almost full drama. They defiantly were right. For one thing this movie was way over hyped. When you see the first section of an entire title usually the second half or next fraction would get better as you progress through the sections but the second part Volume 2 was a real letdown man it just tanked. Take a look at the proper Kung Fu franchise Once Upon A Time In China Trilogy. The first part was an amazing Kung Fu film, which was long, and you had to sit through plot to get to the amazing action scenes just like in Kill Bill Volume 1. In part 2, the movie was shorter and the pace was quickened, and finally in part 3 it was complete non-stop action with very little plot. Now that's a proper Kung Fu franchise. When I see a sequel to a film I enjoyed. I like watching the story progress further down the road. The road, which always tries to be smooth, had some bumps on the road. Just when you got to the prologue part and Bill's (David Carradine) character comes up, his acting just bored everyone to death, I liked him in Kung Fu: The Legend Continues, but man his acting was terrible. It should be known as ""Boring Drama: The Legend should not continue"". If Darly Hannah's scene with the black mamba is the best part you have in this film, you are in serious trouble. Micheal Madsen & Daryl Hannah, they've had better days. This was supposed to be a proper Kung Fu movie just like the way Volume 1 was and the action in Volume 2 was way too empty. Even slow-paced films such as Crouching Tiger, Hidalgo and Peter Pan had more action than this entire film. Even the one fight scene with Daryl Hannah can't save this film. I rather would have watched Peter Pan than this deadly boredom. ACTION and GOOD PLOT: Non-existent GOOD ACTING EXCLUDING UMA THURMAN: Non-existentBottom Line: THIS MOVIE IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST LETDOWNS IN Hollywood HISTORY! TRULY Overrated",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
742,ilias_gizl,Bride with the deBill,8,30 March 2005,"Kill Bill 2 isn't just the sequel of the first movie.It stands imperiously as a self-existent creation.Undoubtedly,it's astonishing.Comparing Kill Bill 2 with Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs would be a trap.These movies are traps by themselves. Presumably,Tarantino could make again a Pulp Fiction.Who would blame him?However,seeing that he is an omnipotent director and he hasn't the same power of surprising like 10 years ago,he did his wonder!And his wonder is double,completed in the second movie. This part focus on Tarantino's attention on the perfection of the screenplay,of course always with the presence of his great directing man oeuvres. The union of the story isn't linear but this fact doesn't deprive the viewer of its complete comprehension.The film is embellished with various philosophical monologues and dialogs which prove that Quentin isn't behind in the ample and interesting shading of the characters and this very shading of Bride's enemies is the reason of transforming her revenge into viewer's revenge. This man certainly knows how to direct and it's easy-understanding that when he does it,he enjoys it.I take his influences from the East for granted and they're given in a masterly way.There aren't so many colors as Kill Bill 1,since the logic of the second part is black and white:Bill vs Bride.Also,there's an evident lyrical mood which makes Kill Bill 2 an epic. The core of the film is David Caradine.""Kung-Fu man"" is acting explosively in the most cool way and he is starring in 2-3 anthology scenes.What a father!The most interesting character is Pai Mei (Gordon Liu) who gives an East-atmospheric tone in the movie.Hannah and Madsen form firm values,whilst for Uma Thurman words are useless.Uma,will you marry me? Conclusively,in my opinion Kill Bill 2 is something different and it cannot be compared with the past Tarantino's films.Quentin steals and he knows it.However,he steals in a perfect way and he makes movies that he likes first of all.Is there any cult director more rich than Tarantino is?Think about it while you're listening to the marvelous soundtrack.Do you think that Kill Bill 2 will be a classic?It still lies in the womb of time...",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
743,winston00,Kill Bill Kills,4,5 August 2005,"It takes more than good editing and cameras effects to make a good film. After Kill Bill Vol1 I was hoping that the second film would have been a bit more fast paced. Unfortunately it wasn't the case lots of unneeded dialogue which was used to fill in, until we got to the action. I thought the scene where Uma got herself out of the coffin which was buried under a ton of soil was so unbelievable that it killed any credibility the film had gained that far into the movie. This film might appeal to the Mtv crowd but I'd give it a miss, if Quentin Tarantino believes he can cover up a mediocre film with flashy editing and a slick cast he certainly has succeeded, judging by the votes he has gotten here.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

KT is a super fan of action movie. So fights are full of his movies. But compare with china's Kong Fu moves, his movies are very low. There is a Chinese Master of Kong FU in the film of Kill Bill, named BaiMei. The master who tech Woman-actor is a serious man. It looks like Chinese style. But, meanwhile, the master is a madcap man too, and this feature led him to die. Violence is the sign of his movies. I think violence not only fight each other between two guys or more.

This film is more dialogue driven than it's predecessor, however is just as enjoyable. Once again the highlight is Uma Truman's lead performance. In fact this film probably displays Thurman's talent as an actress more prominently than ever before. However like it's predecessor this film also features excellent supporting work. David Carradine in particular give an outstanding performance in his villainous role. Daryl Hannah and Michael Madsen are also excellent in this Martial Arts flick.

747,illdesign,This movie is Tarantino's worst...,4,17 September 2006,"Kill Bill vol.1 was a stylistic success, and QT tried to flip the script...but where this film fails is in it's dialog and pacing. Too long, too un-interesting and too Tarantino-ish. It's almost a sad caricature of QT.'s work up to this point. The final ""superhero"" dialog between Beatrix and Bill was so unsuccessful and forced, I wonder if Tarantino was messing with his audience or committing career suicide... or maybe just feeling himself a little too much. In most other parts of the movie the actors fail to deliver on the dialog...and the pacing of the movie is so purposely slow that it renders the experience a snooze-fest.

748,katerinageorgiou-73659,"It's Good, But Not Better Than The First",9,30 October 2018,"It's fine but it could have been better. The first one was entertaining, artistic, action-packed, impressive, archetype... it was something special! Also, Uma Thurman's performance was better in Vol. 1 (she won a Saturn Award and an Empire Award for her performance in this movie and it was the first time she won so many awards and nominations).
Vol. 2 is quite decent but honestly, too much dialogue ruined it. Also, music could have been better. Performances are good, especially David Carradine, who steals the show this time and Daryl Hannah (they both won a Saturn Award for their work in Kill Bill Vol. 2). However, it has more depth and backstory but then again it was too slow-paced.
Quentin Tarantino did an amazing job in Kill Bill Vol. 1 (he proved to the viewers that he was not only a good screenwriter, but also an awesome filmmaker) but Vol. 2 was a bit mediocre comparing to the first one. It lacks on action and badassity, Uma's performance was mediocre, music was mediocre and too much unecessary dialogue lowed it.

749,bwoolf,Bait and Switch...,1,25 April 2004,"I was a huge fan of Kill Bill: Vol 1.  I liked the excitement and story and enjoyed the mix of film styles. Kill Bill: Vol 2 is, on the other hand the most boring, self-indulgent piece of cinematic crap I have had the misfortune to sit through.  I can see why Quentin edited all this junk out of the first one and how he NEVER could have released them in the opposite order.  He spends endless amounts of screen time explaining/showing minutia which you at least hope will be useful later in the film, but ultimately turn out not to be.  His trademark style of mixing up the sequencing here is a total failure as he's constantly interrupting any chance of building tension or a story to go spend 15 minutes on some point that turns out to just detract from the film. Quentin desperately needs someone to stand over his shoulder and say ""NO"" when he's in the editing room and decides to keep a scene running a solid 10 minutes longer than it should. If you feel Ridley Scott was obscenely self-indulgent in that travesty of a film Hannibal you will feel worse about Vol 2 as it doesn't even have a saving grace shock you ending that at least made Hannibal a water cooler topic.

Basically nothing happens in the whole movie. The plot is really inexistent. You could summarize it in a couple of lines and it wouldn't be a synthesis, but just a faithful report of what happens on screen! The first hour is just damn boring! I've never yawned so much at a movie since Matrix 2! The only entertaining part is Daryl Hannah's fight vs The Bride and that's not much! Direction is great, as you would expect from Quentin, but there are so many homages to other movies and styles that you start asking yourself what's the real Tarantino contribution going on here! Acting is absolutely fantastic and Uma Thurman is quite simply majestic. But that's just not enough to build up a decent movie!

It's as disappointing as Matrix: Revolutions.Nothing is really added to the story.  The beginning of Vol. 2 is slow, and the end is slower.  Even after ""Final Chapter"" pops on the screen, the movie won't end.Here are some good quotes from Ebert's review:""There is a lot of explaining in the film.""""Such speeches function in Tarantino not as long-winded detours, but as a way of setting up characters and situations with dimensions it would be difficult to establish dramatically.""""One of the achievements of 'Vol. 2' is that the story is filled in... which consists not of nonstop action but of more hypnotic dialogue...""The speeches are so excessive that I can't help think QT should've just written a book.  There's an expectation you have after seeing Vol. 1, which had the most gratuitous violence of any film I've seen.  Vol. 2 is much longer and has almost no action.  I'm not complaining that Vol. 2 is missing the the gallons of spraying blood; I mean the movie is entirely stagnant. The Pai Mei scene was great, but most of the rest is just monotone dialogue. Carradine is interesting at first, but you quickly get sick of him talking, and by the end of the movie you really wish Uma would just walk in and shoot him instead of talk to him.I don't suppose it's actually as bad as I'm pretending, but it's a complete 180 turnaround from the first movie.

However, the second time around, I got to appreciate it for the great movie it was and how well everything came together. The chemistry between Uma Thurman and David Carradine was amazing. I think it's a crime that Carradine wasn't nominated for an academy award for his performance. Thurman should have been nominated as well.

757,rae-69,the disappointment,5,9 October 2006,i think for an average film director this film would have been a masterpiece but for a director such as Quinten Tarintino its a failure. in comparison to his earlier priceless films this was an embarrassment. the dialogue was poor and did not entirely pull you into their personalities and doesn't give you the belief that they could be real people where as Jackson and Travolta made you believe that they were real people because of the attention to detail in the dialogue. But as always the sound track was phenomenal! with good music you can always add style to a weak film scene! which I think Tarintino took advantage of in this case! The story line was poor and the only thing that fully engrossed me in this film is the well regrouped fight scenes! All though the cast was impressive the film was pieced together poorly and failed to tie in significantly there was just too much left unexplained of my liking!

759,mlambboy,Separates the eye-candy moviegoer from the artistic moviegoer,10,18 April 2004,"First off I'd like to say I thought this installment was by far the more creative, and more enjoyable. Many people have criticized it for having drug on to long, and too much acting and not enough action. Well this clearly has separated us as moviegoers from the first installment.
In the first movie, QT fans, and a few people who just like to pick a random movie and watch it saw it first. They then reccomended it to all their friends, and before you knew it, everyone liked this movie, because it had something for everyone to like. For the action fan, it had plenty of that. For the art fan, scenes like the anime sequence, or the fight in the Japanese garden would more than pacify them. And for the fan of a great acting... I think refraining from talking about Uma's performance would be acceptable seeing as how not many people disagree when someone says that her acting in this was brilliant.But the second movie was a little different. Sure it had all the above elements, but it was lacking a great deal more in the action/eyecandy department. This movie can be compared to Pink Floyd's album ""Wish You Were Here"" in that if you are the type of person that likes brilliant things, you can wait just a little bit longer for them to come out. They are both simply just a test of patience.Volume 2 has many brilliant points in it, such as the Superman dialogue, and the scene at the church, but they slow down a lot at these points, and the average moviegoer just says ""oh come on already,"" but they dont really care about whats actually happening in these scenes, they care more about when the next time they are gonna see blood is. If you stop complaining and just open your ears, and eyes, you will see and hear some of the best acting and dialogue in a movie today.""But Daniel, thats not what I saw in the first one. and thats not what I came to see in this one. So where's the blood?!?!""My answer to you is, its all in the first one. If you are a Tarantino fan, or you are into a good movie, or if you care about what happens to the bride, then watch this one. But if all you care about is some blood and violence, then either rent Vol.1 again, or go pull one of the Halloween movies you have off the shelf and pop it in.-Daniel",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
760,rich.baldwin@nth.com,The movie achieved the results but not like you expected,10,16 April 2004,"Part 2 brings everything to the conclusion that you expected it would but not at all the way you expected or the pace of the first part. Volume 2 is still a story of revenge, but not with massive amounts of violence like in Volume 1. There was a couple of times when we thought that the bride was dead, but she is like a cat with nine lives. There was several shocks and impossible situations, but our heroine came through in ways you thought weren't possible. The use of black and white photography emphasized the drama of the wedding massacre. All in all this is Quentin's best flick yet! Be sure to watch all of the trailer credits - there is an extra ""eyeful"" at the very end!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
761,disliked,Worst movie ever,1,23 February 2007,"The first part of Kill Bill was good, I say good, not excellent or anything, it was OK, you had to keep your brains aside to watch it, but at least it provided us with stunning action sequences, which although defied logic were fun to watch.But this sequel is totally absurd, it defies logic totally and there's not much action, only about 10% of the movie is action the rest 90% is pure BS talk, which doesn't provide any drama, it is not intelligent at all! I'm not saying I don't like movies which have a lot of talking and no action, but this movie is really awful, it will bore the hell out of you.There are so many plot holes, But I can't point them out as I may be blacklisted for posting a spoiler.I am a person who loves these movies - The Shawshank Redemption, Forrest Gump, Enemy at the Gates, etc.. I'm not the Alien vs. Predator type movie buff.I give this movie a 1 out of 10. I bought this movie seeing its 8/10 score. It doesn't deserve a 8. I have never commented on a movie on IMDb before, but I hated this movie so much that I could not resist posting about it.It doesn't deserve to be in the top 250 movies of all times. I agree with the rest of the movies there, they really deserve to be there. I'm really disappointed to see this movie there. I just can't comprehend how did IMDb users trate this piece of 'you know what' this high??!!!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
762,ratchpick,Amazing,10,2 April 2007,"There is something amazing with every Quentin Tarantino film. He is a god of film-making- his style sticks out like a sore thumb. From the opening monologue exchanged between Bill and the bride to Bill's final steps, you can feel Tarantino's power surge through your head. Some call Tarantino a pervert. Yes, he has a thing for excessive violence and sex in his movies, but that's why they are so amazing. He can put incredible amounts of exploitation in his films (even though this film isn't too violent) yet, when he mixes it with dialogue from heaven, can create a powerhouse. This is is greatest achievement in this category. Yes, most of the technology is corny, but that's why it is so freaking awesome. It's supposed to be that way, and that way is the best way anyone can do a movie of this type. Kill Bill is one of the best movies I have seen in my life.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
763,darmac,- you get what you were looking for.,9,22 May 2004,"let s face it, we all know what we are looking for with a QT film...we get it in this movie. Gore, good scenes and characters that you either love to hate or you think they are over the top. Aside from the tripe that will remain nameless this movie is as good as the rest...of the 2 I liked this better ( with the exception of the animation from the 1st ). David Carridine does a good job playing the character 'Bill' and is the face and the voice of the image of the character partially revealed in the first chapter of the 2 movies. Seemingly timeless and aged like the bark of a weathered tree he seemed....ah just see it...10 line minimum? IF you like Tarantino AND liked Chapter 1 THEN see it.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
764,sturyder,she roared and she rampaged (may contain spoilers),8,27 April 2004,now that i have seen both parts of kill bill i can now comment on both parts as one whole movie will i feel is how kill bill vol 1 and 2 should have been done in the first place but enoght about that and on with the review.Vol 1: i personally think that this is the better of the two halfs it has everything that just one film would have (e.g a big cinimatic fight at the end of movie) add to that a great soundtrack and you have one of the best films of 2003 if not of all time. I give Vol 1 ***** out of *****Vol 2: This half of the film at time feels like it is a completely different movie from Vol 1. I have to say that Mr Tarantino always get a great performance from both Uma Thurman (Who was great in Pulp fiction and this but bad in Batman and Robin and the avengers) and Michal Madsan (who i think is the best part of this and Reservoir Dogs). The only real problem i have with this film is the last half hour went on to long and i was hoping for a big fight between the bride and bill but it did not happen. I give Vol 2 **** out of *****I give Kill Bill as a whole ***** out of ***** ok Vol 2 let it down sightly but i still enjoyed it,Kill Bill - Vol. 2
765,Jakob_rud,Tarantino is back... great as always,8,16 May 2004,"Quentin Tarantino is back with the second part of the his latest work, Kill Bill. The first part of Kill Bill can be compared with the work of ""Naturel Born Killers"". In the second part of Kill Bill Tarantino has really captured the brilliant work of Pulp Fiction. All of the individuals are as original as one can get. The short and sharp/witty dialogs truly shows the mark of Tarantinos incredible work that can easily be compared to Pulp Fiction. To sum up. Kill Bill is a true masterpiece with the great screenplay of Naturel Born Killers, the flashbacks of Reservoir Dogs and the dialogs of Pulp Fiction. If you haven't seen it - see it. If you have seen it... see it again",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
766,treefingers,Brilliant Work By Tarantino,10,18 April 2004,"I eagerly watched Kill Bill: Volume 2 this afternoon and when I left, I knew that Quentin never fails to please the audience. A continuation to the so-called ""pretty much all fighting yet great"" first volume, Volume 2 presents the elements of a true classic with the style of Quentin Tarantino. Characters, plot, conflict, and the seek for revenge build to remarkable levels. Although some people argue that the fight scenes are not as long or gory as Volume 1 presents them, they are just as great, if not better. What impressed me most was how Tarantino brought ideas given earlier on in the film BACK towards the deaths of specifically Elle and Bill (yeah, they die in case you didn't predict it by some chance). Tarantino brings his incredible characters to life. My favorites were Pai Mei, with his signature beard wave, and Elle Driver, who, with all other characters, did a fantastic job. My rating: 10/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
767,habsfan123,Best movie of all time,10,17 April 2004,"I consider Kill Bill 1 and 2 one movie and this movie is the best movie of all time hands down.  Tarantino is simply brilliant with every aspect of this movie.  I feel I owe him more money watching these films, the regular admission price is not enough to charge for a piece of art like this. The whole movie was perfectly cast and the storyline was orchestrated with surgeon like precision. When she was in the coffin how many of you thought ""How is she going to get out of this?"" then they cut perfectly to her training and it all made sense. When she finally got to Bill you almost have this feeling they may actually get back together. I've seen thousands of movies in my life and this is at the top of my list, until the tarantino movie comes out. Please Quentin, make movies more often, i need your movies!!!!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
768,quack63,9 out of 10; in this case 1>2,9,16 May 2004,"I found the last part of the film with Bill and Little Kiddo to be weak and somewhat trite, not up to Tarantino standards. Otherwise it was almost measured up to the superlative level of excellence set in Vol. 1. If anything could be added, I would like to have seen a flashback on the story of Brother Budd, a most interesting piece of human debris. Kudos on the fitting end of Ms Driver and her one remaining eye thus avenging the murder of Pei Mei. Tarantino is master artist without peer in the use of blood and gore as the media of choice. Hmmmmmm, gore!That's all I really have to say, but teacher requires at least 10 lines. This harkens back to high school and freshman year of college where one criterion for the measurement of the quality of work was quantity. So now I have 10 lines.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
769,solitaireshark,Tarantino goes back to what he does best,9,15 April 2004,"Like a good director should, Quentin Tarantino has saved the best for last with Kill Bill Vol. 2. The second film is an emotionally charged finale that will leave you with a smile on your face. Without a doubt, this is Tarantino's finest work especially considering that this is supposed to be one giant film. What he has done is taken everything he loves about cinema and put it all into a gem of a film, and this really comes through in the second volume. Kill Bill Vol. 1 was Tarantino's exercise in making an action movie, Volume. 2 is his Citizen Kane. I haven't enjoyed a movie this much in a long time, and the critics agree that this is one of the best films of 2004.While the first half of Kill Bill was a crazy mesh of violence, the second half is a poetic character-driven opus that truly is a heartfelt piece of filmmaking. With Volume. 2, Tarantino goes back to what he does best, and that is showing interesting characters, who deliver the coolest dialogue around. There isn't near the amount of action that Volume. 1 contained, and that turns out to be the strength of part 2. We are finally allowed to see Bill's character and his relationship with The Bride (Uma Thurman). David Carradine plays Bill with a smoothness that oozes cool and is totally lovable. Bill can be a mean SOB but he has a purpose and thanks to some excellent scenes with he and The Bride, we get to see his side of the story. Let me say that it is not what you think, and if anything you will adore the character. Carradine delivers his lines in his own unique way, much like Christopher Walken does. In one scene, he talks about why his favorite character is Superman just before the big showdown and you can't help but love the guy.Other interesting characters inhabit Volume 2 as well. The coolest member of the Viper Squad, Budd, is a cowpoke that realizes the error of his ways and works as a bouncer doing crap work. Michael Madsen plays him with such an air of humility, that you might feel sorry for the guy. Budd is a modern Charles Bronson as a poster in his trailer home references. Not to give too much away, there is a scene involving Budd and The Bride that will have some feeling very claustrophobic just after a dialogue about a flash light and mace. There is a scene with the one eyed Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah) fighting The Bride in very close quarters. This is the best cat fight that will probably ever be seen on film and ends in a shockingly funny way. Be on the lookout for a surprise cameo by a famous Tarantino thesp. Of course The Bride needed training for all of the martial arts, so we get a wonderful flashback sequence of her training with Pei Mei. The training sequence is both hilarious and painful, providing some great glimpses into who The Bride is.Everything surrounding the production of Volume. 2 is top notch. Every chapter is shot with a different film stock, giving each one a different style. Unlike the previous film, Tarantino lets the shots go longer instead of quick cuts, thereby letting us view the characters and events more naturally. Tarantino still uses tricks from his fun bag such as the old fashioned background projections or colored objects in black and white scenes. The music is much more natural and effective in part 2 as well. Robert Rodriguez and his Spanish guitar provide for a cool spaghetti western soundtrack, even Ennio Morricone is used.Tarantino has delivered a very cool flick and the best film of his career. Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a moving film that is the culmination of what makes cinema fun. If you weren't a fan of Volume 1, you may want to give 2 a chance as it is a much different film. We are shown the motivations of these characters and reminded why The Bride is doing what she is. When you laugh and almost cry when a character delivers a line, that's good cinema. A film that leaves you with a huge smile on your face should be seen and seen again.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
770,tony-whelan,Masterpiece.,10,21 April 2004,"Having read some of the comments on here I can honestly say that some people just don't get it. Kill Bill Vol 2 was the best movie released so far this year, QT is a genius that makes movies that he likes to watch, he doesn't care if we like them or not, but the fact is we do, and there are reasons for this.Seems to me that the detractors have probably never seen a spaghetti western, let me recommend one to you.A Fistful of Dollars, see this movie and then watch Kill Bill again and you will see exactly were QT is coming from, his use of silence is as breathtaking as anything Sergio Leone ever did. This is where QT comes into his own, he uses other film makers methods but improves upon them. He is the ultimate fan, and because he knows and loves the genres he pays homage to, we are brought back to these excellent films, and we are left in no doubt that we are seeing one mans love for them.I can honestly say that Kill Bill vol 1 & 2 are probably going to be around a long time, these are movies that will be held as benchmarks for film-makers in the future, in these movies we see how it should be done. QT has his share of problems in life, but directing wonderful movies is not one of them.*****/*****",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
771,dave_taylor999,A bunch of rubbish with the worst anti-climax ever!,3,2 July 2004,"This really is a poor film in my opinion. I really can't understand all the hype. The fighting is poor, and doesn't know what it wants to be. Half-kung-fu, half-comedy, and competent in neither. If you want a decent kung-fu fight, watch a kung-fu film, not this commercialised rubbish.And the story and characters are pathetic. The premise is simple, a long quest for vengeance blahblahblah. But this simple story is somehow spread out over about 4 hours of viewing time (and indeed, this review could easily apply to the first film). Quite how boring I found this, as well as the insertion of pointless scenes (e.g. Budd in the nightclub - why add it if I can't even empathize with the character?), is indescribable.And Tarentino's directing, particularly certain camera styles, is also way below-par. If I had seen this film and none of his others, I wouldn't think he was a half-decent director. Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction fortunately make up for this, but I feel that those films contributed to the misplaced hype surrounding this film.And finally, the ending, which can be summed up in one word: ""WHAT?!"". I was expecting something, anything, from the ending, maybe a huge fight or some half-decent dialogue. What did I get? Some pointless ranting and the worst 'move' ever. The Five-Finger-Majiggy. Not only is this outrageously unrealistic (take four steps, talk for ages, another step and, ooh, he's dead. What a shocker) but it really did let down the film and was a wasted opportunity. I can only assume the script-writer gave up and they had to hire monkies to finish it off.In climax (unlike the film), a massive letdown. This film doesn't belong in a genre (some people for some unfathomable reason call it a thriller) and doesn't belong in a cinema as far as I'm concerned. I have enjoyed many films which have a lesser reputation far more than I enjoyed this.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
772,prohibited-name-1616,"A lot of hype, but nothing impressive",6,16 August 2004,"As a Tarantino fan myself, I have been thoroughly disappointed with this series. Perhaps it was all the hype. Perhaps it was pre-expectations. Regardless, I feel that this film falls well below what it could have been.The cinematography is great. The dirt getting thrown on you in the coffin really puts you 6 feet under with Uma. There are countless other scenes that grab you the same way.But where it lacked the most, was the hook. It took me about 4 days to watch the thing the entire way through. I'd watch 20 min of it, get bored, turn it off, and go do something else, or go to bed. The next night, I'd pick up where I left off. If a movie is fully grabbing me, I will watch the whole thing all the way through. Bill just didn't have that effect on me.Rating: 6",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
773,bart-deville87,Much better then the first one!,9,11 June 2010,"I was going to watch this movie with mixed feelings, I liked the first one but it let me down a bit. I was overwhelmed when i watched this second one. There are really some good conversations in it, much better then the first one in my opinion. There was less action but that really didn't matter, there were enough exciting moments. The acting was great especially David Carradine really did a good job in this one, his conversations are really interesting to watch. The plot was also great (not unexpectedly but exciting) and it gives you the feeling you really care about the characters. I think this movie really deserves a 9 out of 10. If you like Tarantino movies you will really like this one, it's one of my favorites! Greetz",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
774,charlesclover,"Awesome movie, but not up to the level of the first one.",8,18 April 2004,"To me it seemed that Kill Bill Vol. 1 explored some really unique techniques of film-making that the second seemed to ignore in favor of more common techniques. This is not to say that Kill bill Vol. 2 is unoriginal, just that it isn't on the same ground-breaking level as the first. Also, the corny one-liner gag is a little overdone in the second movie; eventually it becomes more annoying than humorous. The one major redeeming factor of this movie is The Bride's (Kiddo's) short tutelage under Pai Mae. He is a very interesting character, portrayed as just the perfect mix between strict taskmaster and rude brute. Several other points also seem to make the movie stand out, including the black and white shot of the wedding rehearsal and the short scene which introduces The Bride's name from an elementary school teacher calling names for attendance.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
775,victork30,Well worth watching again.,7,16 April 2004,"I would give this film a 7.5 out of 10, Tarantino has done a great job of volume 2 it's better than the first. There's a good balance of action, comedy and love, the action is much more believable than the first. The love is not too cheesy, and the fight scenes you can't help but laugh and shout ouch!!We learn the truth about the Bride, how she became so deadly, how she trained under Bill's Master Pai Mei (typical 70's kung fu grand master), I'd say is my favourite part of the film.Uma Thurman shows great acting skills, from fear, sadness joy and just being plain normal. One scene where it seems our heroine has finally met her doom is particularly well acted out its pretty convincing. David Carradine character Bill you almost feel sorry for, I quite liked the guy especially for the ending.Only two things I didn't like about the film, once she gets to Bill the movie does drag on a little, I think Tarantino saw this because he adds in a few surprises should u begin to fall asleep with all the talk. Samuel L Jackson's appearance is a black and white scene as the organ player for the wedding rehearsal, the room is quite dark and being black it is hard to see him, but saying that Tarantino doesn't concentrate much of Jackson's face during his conversations.Funniest scene for me was Budd's calendar scene and Pai Mei laughter whilst beard stroking; think you'll like it too.PS saw it yesterday as my brother works for a cinema company.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
776,widmarbs,Taratino tries to draw attention to himself...,5,16 April 2004,"This movie was an arrogant piece of work by Tarantino.  It moves slowly and the dialogue is often out of place and cheesey and seems to be trying to draw attention to Tarantino more so than it does to the plot and character development.  There is no better example of Tarantino trying to put himself above this movie than at the end when the letters ""Q&U"" take up the entire screen in giving credit to him and Thurman for creating the character of the Bride.  With mild attempts at scoring a few cheap laughs, the movie does a displeasure to itself and the first volume.  There were too many shallow, meaningless violent gags and not enough of the intrigueing dialog and wit this has become the norm for Tarantino.  The film is above average, but does not meet the lofty expectations that people have set up for it.  6 out of 10 at best.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
777,silentbob_tg,Classic Tarantino,10,16 April 2004,"First i must say this is just classic Tarantino. There is little violence in this movie but the dialogue is what makes it. I'm also a big fan of Madsen so him just being in the movie made it great. It has classic characters such as the Pei Mea(SP?), Budd, Elle, and Bill. The story has been greatly improved upon since the first half. The silly blood spray that was in the first half is now gone, which is not a bad thing. Bill and the Brides past really is well done and makes you think Bill isnt really that bad of a person. If you ever are able to free up a few hours go see this movie right away. Thank You Tarantino for this wonderful masterpiece of a movie. I recommend this to everyone 10/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
778,jakob-bohem,a worthy conclusion of last years gorefest!,7,2 May 2004,"Volume 1 spoilers ahead!!I thought the first half of Kill Bill was stimulating in the sense that it delivered an interesting cinematic experience. The action was good but the rhythm felt somewhat wrong with the big ending fight (the kill'em all and the one-on-one felt kind of like one big thing with only a slight pause to mark the intersection) being sort of all there was to the climax of a so far dull plot. For a film to be really great I think it has to surprise me in some way or make me think about things, this is absent in Kill Bill.Volume two put the plot to a little higher grade though it still isn't the most fascinating ever. The style of the film isn't as much Japanese manga-inspired (with the Japanese subject of revenge dead and all) but feels more like a classic American action movie..The playing with styles is really the strength of Kill Bill and this is just as wonderfully displayed in vol 2 as it was in vol 1. The film felt more fluent, and though there was a lot of dialogue it felt pleasurable listening to, perhaps more because of the way it was performed than what was actually said..Overall - a better film throughout than vol 1 but even better as the ending to the great movie that is ""Kill Bill"" 8/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
779,snoogansjl,what it was about,10,17 April 2004,"Well, volume 2 is a continuation of volume 1 (they are one movie, split into 2 parts) and the difference between the two of them are night and day. While the last movie explained very little in the way of plot, and the character's histories, Volume 2 gives you everything that you missed in the last installment. There was some amazing action in this movie. There were less grandiose battles, and more one on one settling of personal differences, which were intimate and really damn cool. While some of the characters may be a bit long winded about their pasts, or their motives, what they talk about is definately worth paying attention to. This will definately strike a chord with the fans of QT. This highly stilized, well directed movie had some nice suprises if you can forget the fact that you know what happens in the end. (I wonder why its called Kill Bill...) Every performance, from the Bride to B.B (her daughter)was stellar. With a jump start beginning, an emotional ending, and some great plot fleshing, action, laughs, emotion, and insight this conclusion of a revenge story, could not have been more sweet.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
780,cadademon,Tarantino thought people wanted to see how the story unfolds and not better action. WRONG,4,23 March 2011,"The Kill Bill movies are supposed to be silly and over the top. I get that, and I in some way applaud them for not being serious and going past rules other movies try so hard to follow. After watching Kill Bill 1, I was pretty happy with the movie. It was, well, silly and over the top with a very entertaining action scene. I don't think 2/3 of the movie should have been about trying to kill that Asian chick but whatever. Speaking of which, how come nobody else got a big animated back story? Like Bill's brother could have had a cool back story animated in some kind of western fashion... but whatever. So even tho Kill Bill 1 was silly it was still a fun movie and I enjoyed it.But what the poop is up with Volume 2? I didn't give a darn and a half for the revenge story and none of the action was even half believable. The first one was far fetched too, but come on. Punching your way out of a coffin? Getting shot in the gut and never acknowledge any signs of pain for the rest of the movie? The 5 finger death poke? Now this would all be OK if there was any fun action scenes to go along with it, but dang, the whole thing is them sitting around talking as if Tarantino thought people actually cared about the story. Which was stupid, but hey. It gave a good reason for a bunch of guys to be thrown around a room in the first one. But if you really cared about the story for some dumb reason then by all means go ahead and watch it. But if you hope that the movie is as cool as the first one then you are in for a disappointment. A boring piece of crap.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

It was that good. The only other movie that has come out recently that compares to Kill Bill vol. 2 is L.O.T.R. Return of the king. Now it might not be solid action like the first one which had the fight between the Bride and the Crazy 88, but instead we got cool scenes, a strong story line, and we learnt The Brides real name. Tarantino is one of the best movie directors and it shows in this movie. I can only hope he comes out with another soon.I hope this makes you want to see the movie because it is worth every penny.Have fun watching!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

This second part mainly brings everything to an end nice and simple and very unique as well.  Quentin once again did a terrific job on directing and writing and producing.  The Acting was once again perfect like Quentins other movies.  Uma did a great job as the bride and no one could replace Dave Carradine for the part of bill.  Most people need to make sure they go into this movie with an open mind, if anyone were to expect as much action and violence as the first one they will be disappointed.  Hopefully Volume 2 will also make the top 250 just like volume 1 because thats what it deserves.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Not only has he created a new kind of movie, but he has created 4 of them. While this movie does contain TONS ofdialouge, it all makes sense. The movie contains drama but it is also a Black Comedy, and is not nearly as violent as the first. I also think it has one of the best fight scenes in movie history. I am talking about The Bride and Bill'sassassin Elle. It is new and unique kind of fight. It has many thrills, and jump in your seat moments.

The picture is superb and the flaws found in volume one feels like nothing anymore.The first volume feels like an introduction after seing this. You get the story explained, and the same feeling of disgust and enjoy at the same time.
I really recommend this to anyone fancy beautiful movies and violence. The fights are awsome, and you get a to laugh many times aswell. Tarantino delivers a jewel with no, or very few flaws.A warning though. If you don't enjoy violence or gore, this is nothing for you.

I was all set to call Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind the best film of the year, and then here comes Volume 2, and it just knocks me flat on my ass. Anybody that complained about Volume 1's graphic violence will be happy to note that the violence has been toned down, and anybody that loved the graphic violence shall be happy to note that there is still some scenes of pretty nasty stuff. I havent smiled this much at a movie since the first time I saw Pulp Fiction. The best part is, you can watch the film for entertainment, or you can watch it to find all the other film references QT has thrown in there. It's brilliant. Quentin's trademark dialogue is back in full force, and he still has an incredible ability to shock you while at the same exact time making you laugh your head off. Just wait until you see the scene in Budd's trailer with Elle. Pai Mei is a hoot. Probably the best part of the film. The cinematography by Robert Richardson is once again superb, my personal favorite being the black and white in !!!SPOILER!!!! the scene where The Bride is buried alive..END SPOILER... The film is a great deal more emotional than Volume 1. Whereas Vol. 1 was just a fun time watching blood and limbs fly, Vol. 2 is rather elegant and understated, if such a word can be used to describe a QT film. Beautiful music from some of the worlds best westerners, and a nice original score from Robert Rodriguez (who should stick to scoring films, and give making films a rest).

I loved the close ups, the bloody faces, and that western music playing throughout the movie. just awesome, Uma's best acting performance ever. i voted a solid 10 for this one. Elle driver was so perfectly evil, and Budd the perfect hillbilly. This movie probably had some of the best writing I have ever seen. David Carradine was so perfect for this role with his leathery face and smooth voice. The wedding chapel masacre made it hard for me to believe he was gonna kill everyone at all.

787,DrexlSpivey88,Tarantino's Best Yet.,10,22 April 2004,"Kill Bill 2 is, by far, the most powerful film to come out of Tarantino's massive head.  Maybe it isn't as hilarious as Pulp Fiction, or as jam-packed with blood, gore, and action as Kill Bill Volume One, but it is by far the most emotional. I'll be honest, when I went in to see this at a late night show, I had already heard that it was slow, boring, and that the dialogue was monotonous, and I feared that I might fall asleep at a Tarantino movie, god forbid. Instead I cried. The Bride and Bill now join the illustrious list of film characters who have illicited tears from me, next to Jesus and Samwise Gamgee. Quentin crafts a relationship with these two that is much deeper than any we have seen from him before.  There is a bittersweet kind of connedtion between the two, right down to the very end. But, aside from all of the emotions, there is also plenty of other good things about this picture. Michael Madsen's portrayal of Budd is so well done that I go from wanting to feel bad for the man to wanting to cut his head off in the course of two minutes and one plot twist.  I won't give away the big surprise related to him, but let's just say it strikes when you least expect it. Darryl Hannah's Elle Driver serves one purpouse in this film; to get the livng snot beat out of her in the most epic catfight of all time.  She fullfills her duties well. Quite honestly, this review doesn't really explain how good Volume 2 is.  You have to see it for yourself.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
788,persanell_jinx,Worth A Look,8,24 April 2004,"The 5th film by Quentin Tarrantino was somewhat a disappointment. Those expecting to see a huge super-slashing blood bath seen in Vol.1 will not have  their expectations met. The bride only kills one person in this film (guess who it  is). Along with the lack of action comes the disapointing soundtrack filled only  with spaghetti western themes and no other music genre. Enough about the shortcumings heres the good stuff. The dialogue is back... okay it's not as great  as classic lines like 'you know what they call a quarter pounder with cheese in  france' and 'are you gonna bark all day little doggy, or are you gonna bite?' but  still there a streams of dialogue that inspire a good chuckle. All the characters in  the film are good and they each have their moments of dialogue spotlight.

789,peter65,quite simply brilliance,10,24 April 2004,"After being a huge fan on Kill Bill: Volume One, I was not particularly expecting to be impressed by Volume Two - mainly due to the much rumoured genre change.  Upon viewing the movie, however, my doubts were all set aside easily.Volume Two builds up the characters a lot more, and we begin to understand the motivations each character has much more. We are also introduced to several new characters - my personal favourite of which has got to be The Bride's martial arts master ""Pai Mei"", who provides much comedy with the numerous times he laughs and strokes his beard. The music is of course a huge asset to this movie - utilising pre-existing spaghetti-western soundtrack pieces with great effect.This movie was well worth the wait.

I felt that the story was average and the plot lacked a punch. I still gave it 4 out of 4 stars.  Vol. 2...is better.  Granted, there is not as much action (which, to me, is a good thing) but there is more Tarantino dialogue.  I loved ever part of this movie, and i was never bored. The piecing of ""The Brides"" past and present was the key to this film. The plot unfolds and the story is told. Unlike vol. 1, we actually feel for the bride and for bill.  We understand the story, and we understand the characters.  Tarantino has built some powerful players in this film.  This movie is better than vol. 1 in virtually every way, and will surely make my top 100 upon second viewing.  My only gripe is that the ending wasn't quite as fantastic...but I guess that could be a good thing.  As in, it wasn't expected.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
791,temescalian,unique and entertaining,10,17 April 2004,"That quirky Tarantino.  Like his other films, he really puts his eccentricity into this.  In this movie he demonstrates his mastery of manipulation and direction.  One minute I'm laughing, the next I'm sad, then angry, then laughing again.   Sometimes I experienced more than one emotion at a given time.  The story telling is overt and purposefully over the top, playing off of cliches from older genres of film, particularly that of martial arts.I watched vol.1 with my Happa roommate and he confirmed that the action sequences were very reminiscent of the old samurai movies he used to watch, and with lovably hilarious Master Pai Mei in vol.2, there was no doubt of QT's references--no, his enthusiasm for old chinese kung fu films.  In retrospect it makes you think, ""I just watched a samurai duel take place inside of a cramped trailer in the middle of the desert and I accepted every moment of it--to say the least."" Tarantino infuses and integrates the kind of elements that one would otherwise find incredulous; so seamlessly and with such unique prose.  The type of attitude you see in his character interactions makes you chuckle, even amidst the gravity of the situation if you stop to think about it.The second movie is what some would consider slower than the first. Still, I found even the heartless antagonists to have their own sense of charm--adding to the mixed sensations I was speaking of.  Personally, I hardly missed the mindlessly excessive gore found in Vol.1
For me, it was a unique, over-the-top, and utterly entertaining film. Very intentional and well composed.  I would recommend both volumes of Kill Bill UNLESS you are squeamish about blood or are completely unable to comprehend any cultural satire presented before you.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

793,punkskiian,This movie rocked my socks off! (SPOILERS),10,18 April 2004,"Kill Bill Volume 2 is utterly incredible.  It creates this perfectly balanced ""yin-yang"" effect with Volume 1. I would suggest buying into ""The Man's"" sleazy marketing scheme and renting and watching Kill Bill 1 before seeing Kill Bill 2 just so you can get the full effect.  While Volume 1 focuses almost entirely on the Bride's (AKA Beatrix Kiddo--""Silly rabbit TRIX are for KIDs"") invincible, natural born killer nature, Volume 2 tones it down a bit to show a much more human, survival-oriented, and even motherly side of her.  In fact, the only person she ends up killing in Volume 2 is Bill himself, and even that is a very emotional scene.  Volume 2 takes a look at how she got to be the world's deadliest woman, while simultaneously focusing on her following through to the end of her journey. As you might know if you paid attention to the end of Volume 1, her child is still alive, and that adds a whole new element to the story.

These are the types of movies that are meant for enjoyment, they are meant to honor kung fu movies and to satisfy an audience. Tarantino isn't proving anything, or showing off, he is just creating something that years from now, someone can look back and say: this is some seriously awesome shit and not help but smile.  You can watch other movies and be shocked, or empathize with the character, or maybe cry if someone dies, but for once it is nice to just walk into a movie theater and just enjoy a movie!

I dont have to go on a long spiel about it, just know the movie is very entertaining, all questions are explained that may have arisen in Volume 1, and Uma Thurman absolutely kicks ass.In advance, I'm sure there will be at least one guy that says ""that movie sucked,"" to which I would reply:  If you enjoy QT movies, which are a genre all to themself, and you DONT like this movie, then you should consider yourself NOT good source for opinion, as you lack imagination, humor, and a certain level of depth required to completely appreciate this movie.

If you considered vol. 1 to be a master piece, vol. 2 was a work from the hands of God.  The thought process and emotions of Q are on a level I've never seen anyone imagine.

Which she does in some over-the-top Kabuki-style Fighting.I made myself watch all of ""Kill Bill vol. 1"" and made it through 30 minutes of ""Kill Bill vol. 2"" before I gave up on the appalling stupidity of the story. It's bad enough when a film has massive fights and destruction in public areas but no cops ever show up, or has a character commit two brutal murders in a medical clinic but no one even notices, but to have anyone be allowed to take a deadly weapon into the cabin of a passenger plane is beyond the realm of ludicrous.What finally tore it was when the Bride fell for the oldest, dumbest trap in the world. Sh'es supposed to be a great, crafty, intensely focused warrior, and it was so insanely obvious a trap, I honestly thought it was meant to be a feint. It wasn't. So I dumped the movie from my player and am sending it back to Netflix. I'll never watch another Tarantino film.If all you want is Hong Kong style fighting from the 1970s, with limbs lopped off and spewing blood as dozens of bad-boi-bodyguards stand around and take turns attacking the protagonist so they can all be slaughtered, this movie's for you.

799,catroni,Quentin's best feature,9,19 April 2004,"I will say it right away: I was sceptical about Tarantino and always viewed him as talented yes, but overrated. It seamed he never had a style that really stood on its own, but rather based on the cinema he had been watching since a kid. He was an excellent recycler (the best and what I truly liked of him: never tried to hide that he was referring and sometimes copying some of his mentors.)Still, I couldn't wait for Kill Bill. And I enjoyed it very much. A lot of violence, yes. But unreel and not to be taken seriously. But in my mind, this film was a B-movie. One of the best. Along with memorable films such as The Killing(Kubrick), Touch of Evil (Welles)... and Pulp Fiction of course.Then came Volume 2. I was infiltrated in the picture and felt the magic in every scenes. Uma is unbelievable as is Caradine. As I watched this unforgettable film, I now understood why this film was separated from its predecessor: The tone is different, and so is the ambiance. Vol.1 was a Samurai picture, this one is a Spagetthi western. The editing is also great, because some of the scenes that could have been unbelievable, were believable because of the way the film was constructed. It reminded me of 60's cinema, and the intro reminded me of 40's film noir.With Volume 2, Tarantino actually polished a genre that have not been taken seriously for a long time: The B-Picture. He could have sell his soul and do typical Hollywood pictures, but Quentin has a quality that most Hollywood filmmakers don't possess (besides Burton and a selected few): Passion and dedication for the stories he wants to tell... and no compromise.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
800,cakeling,"Less violence, more brutality?",9,18 April 2004,"As someone who has never really been a big Tarantino fan, I wasn't expecting to enjoy either volume of Kill Bill. However, the first defied my expectations and was one of my favourite films of last year, and Vol. 2 in my opinion betters it. If you're after more of what you saw in Vol. 1, this movie may not be for you, but if the characters piqued your interest then Vol. 2 should offer you plenty. QT cuts back on the violence to the extent that it simply serves to punctuate the chapters, but the brutality of the first is exceeded because this film is far more personal. The story of Bill and The Bride really is a tragic one (although the comic touches throughout keep the film from being depressing), and is definitely worth telling. Uma Thurman was made for this role and plays it to perfection, with the rest of the cast complementing her with excellent performances.It's not as much fun as Vol. 1, that much is certain, but I believe that it stands up better on its own as well as providing a fantastic conclusion to the first volume.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

The character development is among the best of the best.  The movie could not have been done any better.My faviorate movie has alwasys been Pulp Fiction, but if I could take Kill Bill as a whole movie, it would top my list.I highly recommend anyone to as least give this movie a try, with an open mind.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Thats why I'm going to count them as one. Yes, the film has it's share of cliches but they seem intentional, so I wasn't bothered. In Vol. 2 it takes more time to build up the story that Vol. 1 didn't completely cover. It shows you the sides of every persons story and develops the characters. It doesn't have the breath-taking fighting scenes the first one has, but as one movie, it has the best story development and action I've seen in a while. People who hate this movie, are normally people who don't like the trailer and decide to not see the movie itself. Thats how I was before I finally saw Vol. 1.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

The second part reminded me something from the film ""Natural born killers"" (the scenes in the desert) and something from the old TV-series ""Kung-fu"" (the flash back with the Saolin priest) with David Caradine, who is good enough as ""Bill"", too. Uma Thurman looks like enjoying her role and Darryl Hannah is equally good as her opponent. The dialog between Bill and the Bride at the end of the film is very clever and I believe that has a lot of suspense, explaining at the same time, everything about their previous relationship and the reasons of their violent behavior.

I am a huge fan of Quentin Tarantino. I think he is the best thing that Hollywood has going for it right now. The first time I saw Pulp Fiction I was just amazed by it.  I also loved Jackie Brown and Resevior Dogs. Then Kill Bill Volume 1 came out, and I absolutely loved it. I could not wait to see Volume 2. After seeing Volume 2, I think that both Volumes together is now my favorite Tarantino movie. Uma Thurman's performance in my opinion, is the greatest performance that at least I have seen by an actress. Bill is one of my favorite villians ever. What a spectacular character. I could go on and on about all of the things I loved about this movie. When they come out with an unedited collector's edition DVD of both of them, it is going to be so amazing.

805,topaztiazel,"Wonderful piece, but it might not be what you expect.",8,16 April 2004,"Kill Bill Vol. 2, the second half of an intended full-throttle 4 hour epic, is amazing in its own right. However, viewers may feel surprised when the credits begin to roll, as, despite being aforementioned second half, Vol. 2 is almost entirely different.It's almost hard to believe that Tarantino planned to keep the movie as one piece, especially since the focus of each ""volume"" contrasts greatly. In Vol. 1, the focus was to give enough story to support what was to happen on screen. The focus was action over plot, certainly. Viewers were treated to gorgeous fight scenes (most notably at the House Of Blue Leaves) only knowing the mere basics of the plot. With Vol. 2, the focus has flipped over to character development. We learn more about the Bride's past, as well as the other members of DVAS, and the settings are (seemingly) intentionally more dull in order to allow us to focus on the characters.And nothing is wrong with this, at all. Tarantino has certainly succeeded in giving life to his cast, and the actors (especially Thurman and Carradine) have no trouble portraying their parts. The only flaw, then, is that the movie is just not what the typical Vol. 1 viewer expects. Nevertheless, Vol. 2 is a treat that no fan of Vol. 1 should miss, but don't expect another House Of Blue Leaves.8/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
806,alan-mayer,What a masterpiece! Such a brilliant turn for Tarantino to make!,10,19 April 2004,"I would like to say that I have read some comments already made of the film, one that gave a dissatisfied review. His comments made of the film were that it did not have a very clear love story shown between Bill and the Bride, and that the fight scenes were not of the caliber of Vol. 1. In reply, I would like to state that the love story was one of the most poignant touches in the whole film. You feel Uma's anguish in this piece, and you sense a very heartfelt love between the two when they share the screen together. The fight scenes were not that of the House of Blue Leaves sequence in Vol. 1, nor were they meant to be. This movie is a Spaghetti Western and Kung-fu epic at heart; it's ferocity and wit is astounding to see, and the writing is, above all, compelling. In fact, there is not a single piece of dialogue that lost me, and the flashbacks tie in to important sections of Uma's survival that I cannot reveal to you until you have seen it (wow, what a shock and surprise!). The dialogue may not be blunt and frank, but its depth speaks for itself. The story about the fish on the ground, or Superman's masked identity is probably one of the most awe-inspiring pieces of dialogue that I have ever heard. This is a film that brings back some of the things that have brought aboard fans of Tarantino. Granted, Vol. 1 is just as pleasing to Tarantino fans, but this one reminds us of the genius of Tarantino's writing, and what he brought back to cinema with Reservoir Dogs. This is a tour de force or massive cinematic power, it is Tarantino using his budget to the best of his ability, and is his ability exceptional! Prepare yourself for a classic!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

This was not the case the dialogue however well delivered or not by the actors was uncool and definently not even close to the work he did with Avary(Props). There were some highly pleasing moments mostly the training scenes but i think  all the avenues that could have been taken for a homage movie like this were overlooked and the story was not entertaining enough to come off.

The reason I thought i should change this vote, was because when I thought about it, there is nothing I can think of to change this movie to make it any better. Mr. Tarentino has done something with these two films that is unique in the midst of most film-making today. When you first see Bill, (or rather, hear Bill) He is the most despicable of the despicable. You can't wait to see The Bride get to him in the end.

I had read that Quentin Tarentino was going for an East-meets-West combination, and in my opinion, he nailed it.  If you're looking for more of the first installment, then you might not like the second half as much since it's more story than action- I personally thought the second half was just as good as the first, but for different reasons- the acting was amazing and I unlike most movies out in this day and age, I cared about what happened to the characters.  Overall, I loved it and can't wait until it comes out on DVD.In closing, I personally wouldn't base going to see a movie or not going to see a movie on people's reviews- you might view the movie differently and every person has their own personal taste so definitely check it out for yourself!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

Like many other impatient viewers, I too had read the screenplay online long before the movie hit the screens. But it did not diminish my movie experience in the least.The camera changes from black-and-white to color to grainy, and back to black-and-white... and back to color. But Tarantino's prolonged and indulgent ode to his influences and pop-culture is driven to a riveting end. From the moment we see the killer turned expectant bride in that chapel, rehearsing for her wedding to a record store employee, to the final scene of the final chapter, Kill Bill Vol. 2 is an exhilerating and mostly satisfying cinematic journey.I did find the Budd story a little bit of an unwanted diversion. Instead, Tarantino could have let the casino scene with Bill make it through the final cut (if you don't know what I am talking about, you can read the script online). It would have had more relevance in developing Bill's character, which is of course crucial. But strong performances all around more than make up for this shortcoming.I especially enjoyed the cruel tutelage of Pai Mei. I felt Tarantino succeeded at maintaining the fine balance between edgy humor and over-the-top ridicule in paying homage to Chinese Kung-fu movies, with those sudden facial close-ups, Pai Mei's arrogant laughter, and his repeated stroking of that wispy beard.But to me, the best chapter was easily the final one. I was pleasantly surprised to see how genuine the interaction between father (Bill), mother (Beatrix/Uma) and child (B.B.) looked onscreen. David Carradine, who puts in a strong performance throughout, shines especially in this chapter. In particular, the `goldfish' scene where he recounts how their daughter learned about life and death was captivating and insightful.I give this movie 9/10.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
814,theking-14,This movie IS for everybody!!!!,10,17 April 2004,I saw this movie last night with my brother and we were stunned at all the beautiful camera work. The direction of this movie is enough to see the movie alone. The comes the movie itself which is amazing. Its better than the first volume and keeps itself fresh the whole way through. Its got a very good story and they pull it off brilliantly. The score adds to the movie to you'll especially notice how good the soundtrack is when the bride fights Elle.Spoiler ALERT...My favorite scene is where she's buried alive it actually made you feel helpless and like you could barely move. The music when shes digging out is also some of the best off the soundtrack.My only complaint is that we didn't get to see Bill use his kung fu skills. The fight at the end should have well.. happened because there wasn't a fight really.The training scenes were unforgettable as is the whole movie. I recommend this movie even if you didn't like volume 1 because they are very different in so many ways. Go see this movie. 10/10,Kill Bill - Vol. 2
815,PRjavi,Is just very cool,10,24 April 2004,"i just like it very much Kill Bill: Vol. 2.is just very cool and straight with the story.continues as The Bride(Uma Thurman) continues to completing his vengeance of Bill(David Carradine) and his remaining members Elle Driver(Daryl Hannah) and Budd(Michael Madsen),i like it very much because the story flows just were the vol. 1 just left off,the Force's of ""The Bride""  is just stunning that even broke a coffin with his very hands and walk her way out to Budd's house again fight Elle.the fighting is just better than the first one,though not as bloody that the first,is just not exaggerating though,and have is bloody bodies too hehe.and the stuns and blows were better than the first seeing ""The Bride"" kicking butts is just a cool experience.and too Pai Mei(Gordon Liu) kicking ""The Bride's butt is just cool too.the whole movie is very good,it envolves in the plot and story why her wants to kill them.is to get revenge and secure that they not do to other persons what they did to her,in a bloody form of taking justice but they did worse on her.thats why i like it very much the Performance of Thurman is good too.showing seriousness and hatred for they and sometimes compasion and love for others.Quentin's kill Bill sequel is better thatn many others sequels because he did not change the story and format of the movie.thats why i like Quentin Tarrantino in this sort of movies,because he is the best in this sorts of movies.i am a big fan of Kill Bill series and i recommend to anyone who whant to see a woman's Force's of Will and Prowess with self-confident to do her goal,Kill Bill :)",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
816,Infernalflora,I haven't seen this great a movie in years.,10,29 April 2004,"I was quite astonished at the work put into this film. I hadn't seen Volume 1 in theaters. I purchased the movie upon it's release, just in time for Volume 2. I knew little about the film's details, and only a little more about it's plot. I must say I was thrilled with Volume 1, and far more thrilled with Volume 2. Tarantino's work is unique to say the least. He has a distinction all his own, and it is the dialogue within his films I find most exhilarating. The character of Bill is, well, a literary piece of perfection. Normally, long scenes of dialogue are boring and uninteresting. However, when ""Bill"" tells his tales and spills his stories, it is hard to not be involved. Volume 2 is a bit opposite of Volume 1. Gore, guts, and gross-out stuff prevailed, while explanation, tied-up loose ends, and revelation ruled Volume 2. Each piece of this story is excellent alone, but when you travel back to reality and remember that it's a two part film, well, then you can learn to appreciate such unity, organization, and perfection in film-""creating"".",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
817,rexfelis00,More story than gory. Thanks,10,18 April 2004,"I enjoyed this film much more than the needlessly gratuitous Vol 1.  While Vol 1 had some great scenes, in hindsight it only serves to create a motivational backstory for the anti-hero played by Thurman. One could spend a few sentences to summarize Vol 1 to a friend (who has not seen it) then direct them to Vol 2 to the same story told better.
If Vol 1 had the too-narrow focus on bloody revenge, then Vol 2 is the belated payoff to QT's fans who hoped he would create a tale with more feeling, like he did with Pulp Fiction.I felt Vol 2 expertly drew me into the narrative through the same use of gritty visuals as Vol 1, but was more successful because it used suspense more than comically-graphic spurts of arterial blood.  Vol 2 played upon fears of the dark, closed spaces and helplessness, all while interjecting the humanity of family in the form of a wedding then later a mother's love for a child.  I was able to relate more to Vol 2 because it's satire content used family concepts that I am familiar with.While Vol 1 was still fun ride that alternately caused me to grimace and gag, or blink in startled amusement, or chuckle with guilty pleasure at the violence, Vol 2 is the pay-off that removes the guilt and lays out a human story told in the wonderfully absurd Tarrentino tradition.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
818,fellc,"Excellent plot, edge of my seat every second. A must see.",10,19 April 2004,"If anyone had any problems with the first volume, Quentin answers those naysayers with this spectacular conclusion.  David Carradine is especially good, and Gordon Liu is hilarious as the master Pai Mei.  Fight scenes not as extensive or bloody as the first movie, but the plot is more developed, and all questions are answered.  Quentin doesn't fail to use flashbacks and black and white sequences.  This volume is more of a tribute to spaghetti westerns than to samurai films, although there are some references in certain scenes, most particularly ""The tutelage of Pai Mei"".  It doesn't seem to be necessary to have seen the first volume, all though I would definitely recommend it because it is a dazzling film and supplements vol 2 quite well.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
819,dvf-1,Kill Bill? Kill me!,2,19 April 2004,"I know that almost all of the people who will read these reviews are in LOVE with Tarantino, and don't get me wrong I really love his movies; Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, both films were written and directed very well. However, Kill Bill 2 sucks! So what if this is his fifth film, his tenth film, or his first film, I mean really do we really care? There are plenty of directors and writers out there that have made better films and more of them. As a film student I view films all the time and I could have made this film, bottom line, not that I would have wanted too. But if I had the money and I could have used the same actors etc; I could have easily made this boring, long, totally pointless film. Let's be honest both Kill 1 and Kill 2 look like a college students final project before he goes out into the film making world. Quentin needs to grow up and try making a film that is good and that will make some money. Bottom line here is watch it at a friends house because it's not even worth renting.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
820,coletrickle90,Better than Vol. 1!!!,10,19 April 2004,"Quentin Tarantino's latest effort is so thoroughly satisfying, even his strongest supporters might be amazed.  I certainly am.  Although it can't match ""Pulp Fiction"" outright, it reminds us of how much he can obliterate our notions of what is possible, or perhaps just prove that QT is the singular most clever and entertaining filmmaker today.
Vol. 1 was a rock 'em sock 'em video game action extravaganza that borders on saturation.  But now with Vol. 2, any doubt about the values of the first installment can be forgiven.Vol. 2 hits on most every element I love about movies.QT's God blesses him.  We thank him.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
821,sprookjesfilm,A poor second half to a great first.,5,25 April 2004,"Once you have seen Kill Bill vol.1, you are thrilled to see the second part of the movie. But the problem with the second half is that there is too much explaining to do, to make good for the first. Even when the first didn't really need any explanation. Still, Quentin had to fill in to make this second half into a feature, so here we go with pointless scenes about a deadbeat Budd who has some issues with his boss. A Spanish pimp and a training sequence to explain the miraculous escape of the Bride from the coffin.While the first part was exciting, the second part is disappointing, not to say a bit boring. They should have made 1 movie instead of two, and the result would be as good as Quentin's amazing Pulp Fiction. But financial consideration made it into two unbalanced pieces.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
822,sacred_minotaur,Excellent,10,21 April 2004,"For those ignorant boobs who think this movie sucks with the lack of action, grow up. Movies arn't all about action, look at the dialogue and storyline, and how QT made fun of the 70's when they first figured out that there was a zoom button and they used it for everything. It also uses themes from old Samurai and Western films that also made this movie excellent, no one can deny how good this movie is. Don't compare this to the first one, WOW the first one had 80 limbs chopped off, oh well if this doesn't it is a great way to wrap up the end of the movie.This has a great story line with enough action to tingle my needs.

It may not be ""strange"" enough to satisfy the hardcore Tarantino fans, but the telling of the story was phenomenal.  I have to see this again!  Some may argue that there was no action scenes, but those people must realize that Tarantino already covered that genre in Vol. 1.  Even with all of the jumping around the timeline does, it is not hard to follow the events and put them together in your mind.  This movie really took the viewer on some emotional highs and lows, you really sympathised with The Bride's experiences.  The emotional attachments she had with Bill really explained her rage.  This is a masterpiece story!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
824,mpnc,"Good, but few will be happy with this Sequel",7,23 April 2004,"I think that many fans of Kill Bill vol.1 will be disappointed, as vol.2; though its a good film does not display the originality of story telling techniques, which the first film did so creatively. My prediction is that fans of QT films will enjoy vol.2 the most, but for the average cinema viewer they will feel as though there are not enough action sequences. Me as a huge fan of QT and Kill Bill vol.1 was disappointed in the lack of 'that something special' which defines his other films, however throughout the film I was steadily entertained. My favourite part of the film was the wedding scene at the start and fight with Elle (Daryl Hannah). My worst parts Bill's death  and Budd and Bill being brothers seemed pointless. Great ideas: when we find out her name and a clip shows her in class. Referring to the movie adverts at the start. Score 7/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
825,xsmd723x,Truly brilliant,10,23 April 2004,"Kill Bill Volume 1: **** Kill Bill Vol. 2: **** Kill Bill as a whole: One of the top 20 movies of all timeBoth movies are easily four star movies.  They are brilliant.  However, what each one lacks, the other makes up for.  Examples: In volume 1, there was no character development.   That was made up for in volume 2.  In volume 2 there wasn't non-stop action sequences.  In volume 1, there was.  In volume 1, however, there was hardly any of that brilliant dialogue.  That is made up for entirely in volume 2.When you combined the 2 movies together and make them one (which by the way they were originally intended to be) then you have an amazing movie. People say that the styles are way too different to be one movie.  I don't think so.  Tarantino has done something truly original here.  In his last movie before the Kill Bill saga, Jackie Brown, he spent the first half of the movie developing characters and just letting them talk.  In result, it was much slower in the first half of the movie.  With Kill Bill, Vol. 2 he develops the charactes in the *second* half of the movie.
Standing alone, Vol. 2 works as it's own movie.  It is probably the best movie you'll see this year.  It has everything: dialogue, action, great characters (Budd, Bill, and the Bride come to mind) and a great ending. With Vol. 1, it is not only the best movie of the year, it just may be the best movie of the decade.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

827,kiehlchristie,subtly disturbing,1,24 April 2004,"So the second half of Tarantino's epic Kill Bill promised to be the pick me up the first required to stand up and be validated.  It failed miserably in that attempt.  Beware, there may be some spoilers.Kill Bill 2 suffers from a shift in directorial tone so drastic that much of what Tarantino so effectively did in the first one was lost.  In the second installment the audience is shown the softer side of Thurman's character. Instead of the spectacle of Thurman out slaughtering hundreds of people in enacting her heroic vengeance, we see her succumb to the psychological trauma that would naturally follow from what she had just participated in. The empowered woman of the first installment (which is a problem in itself: giving a woman a sword and implying that she's empowered) had all together fallen apart and assumed the role of the helpless and weak.Kill Bill 2 lacks the elaborately sarcastic violence that made the first volume close to palatable.  The second is filled with an overtly sadistic misogyny that is disturbing to watch, for example, Budd shooting Thurman in the chest with rock salt and burying her alive after threatening to fill her eye-sockets with mace.  All of this in an uncomfortably close quarters with Thurman so that we can watch her suffer.  Where the first movie had fun with its overblown violence; the second relishes in a much more terribly painful place.Kill Bill 2, does however; include some instances of rich dialogue.  There is a scene where Carradine and Thurman discuss superheroes and why it is that they are popular.  The audience learns the appeal of superman, where he differs from other super heroes.  Instead of a human that changes to an alter ego, superman is an alter ego that changes into a human.  This conversation is reminiscent of Tarantino's older works, but is short-lived.
One of the problems with the Kill Bill movies may actually be with more than just the movie.  Tarantino champions the middle-class white male perspective, and this perspective becomes visible if we consider the stereotypes adopted by each character.  For example in the first movie we see a juxtaposition of two kinds of stereotypes imposed on Japanese women by American men.  The first is the school girl, adopted by Oren Ishi's body guard, and the other is Oren herself, dressed in traditional Japanese garb for the final battle with Thurman.  In the first installment, Tarantino effectively wrapped these stereotypes and issues into a sardonic and nearly humorous violence.  In the second, Tarantino disregards that tone.  So what the audience is left with is a plot that very subtly declares a deeper malaise beyond the movie.  It exposes an unspoken evolution in American racism and sexism, and I believe it does so unintentionally.
Half of what made me feel ill when I left the movie theater last Sunday was the movie, and the other half was its being so popular",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
828,ltucescott,We've seen it all before,6,25 April 2004,"First off, I have to admit that I hold Kill Bill Vol 2 to a higher standard do to the fact it is made by Quentin Tarantino.  Also, I felt so much hype around the movie that it inflated my expectations.When some people read my One Line Summary ""We've seen it all before"" they will think, ""Thats the point, Tarantino is paying homage to films that influenced him.""  However, I don't think recycling old ideas to squeeze a few more bucks out of them is paying homage.  One of the things I anticipated the most when watching Kill Bill Vol 2 is finally finding out The Bride's name.  I thought this was a pretty cool idea, but its really stolen from The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.  If you've seen many martial arts movies, like me, you'll probably be pretty unexcited about the action in both Kill Bill volumes.  It definitely doesn't break any new ground with special effects or new styles of displaying fighting.  *This part of my comments could be considered a minor spoiler so skip to the end of the next paragraph if you want* I loved and hated Pai Mei at the same time.  I loved his laugh and how he played with his beard, but personally, I find the stereotype of the ancient and insanely strict kung fu master pretty tired. I can't count the number of movies I've seen where someone goes to be trained by a kung fu master.  The master is ALWAYS barking orders to the pupil and ALWAYS uses some weird training techniques (wax on - wax off, catch the chicken, etc).Personally, I felt the best thing about Kill Bill was its style, and I felt that most of its style came from the music.  The Kill Bill soundtrack is definitely something I'd look into getting.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
829,benoubo,Not as good as Kill bill vol. 1,8,25 April 2004,"I've been expected kill bill vol. 2 since I watched vol. 1. But to my surprise, the two volumes are in totally different style, though by the same director/writer. Vol. 1 concentrate on the action/brutal photography, which might bring you some inside feeling you could never articulate but at least you can you are shocked when you finished vol. 1. Vol. 2, tells us a story, comedy/philosophy/drama type. I like vol. 1 more than vol. 2, coz I appreciated the director style of vol. 1, thinking it differentiate the director from other thriller/action directors. But the vol. 2, I guess, maybe consider too much about the common psychology and needs. It can make you laugh and chuckle all through the whole movie, it has much dialogue, but it neglects the expectation most audience would have been waiting for since vol. 1. So I give vol. 2 a 8 out of 10.Anyway, if you watch the vol. 1 & 2 together, it would be a masterpiece.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

831,perfectcolour,Bloated & Boring,1,27 April 2004,"When I first heard about Kill Bill, it sounded like a filler project, a fun exercise in which Tarrantino cold pay homage, riff and rip-off his favourite genre pics. If this had been true, I might have enjoyed this film (for it really does not not deserve to be listed as 2 films) and would not have this sense of disappointment and sadness at an obviously talented filmmaker being allowed to indulge himself so completely in what is in reality, a very, very slim premise for a a 247 min film. I can understand why the Weinsteins wanted 2 films, because it is good business, but surely Producer Lawrence Bender,  should have stepped in and questioned the motivations of  his Director and suggested some much-needed pruning of his ""epic"".Whilst I wasn't blown away by Volume 1, I enjoyed its trashy homage to the Grindhouse  pictures clearly dear to its Director's heart and I was intrigued to see how he would weave the Spaghetti western genre into Volume 2. Spaghetti Western!!! To even mention this film in the same breath a Leone et al. is the funniest thing I have heard in years. Believe me. this is no Western, this is no cool, revenge flick, this is simply an exercise in style that runs out of steam way before the inevitable denouement.There are scenes in this film that go nowhere, dialogue that meanders and ultimately bores and action that whilst wonderfully choreographed (esp Vol... 1), has no real excitement or genuine sense of danger. The much-anticipated Pai Mei training was dull dull dull and I honestly wondered if I had experienced a micro sleep during this part, as I felt the whole sequence was under-developed and incomplete.There are however, some wonderful moments in these films, but the poor editing and bloated direction means you have to wait and wait for so long for them to happen, that you begin to question whether you're really that interested in these shallow characters anyway. The characters in this films are supposedly the epitome of iconic cool, but they are like the sets of Old Hollywood westerns, well-dressed facades, with nothing behind, but the desert.A disappointment on every level.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
832,gogginboy,"tarantino, where have you gone?",4,4 May 2004,"Admittadly im an avid fan of this director, producer and writer.From Dusk till Dawn was interesting and fun, Resovior Dogs was superb and Pulp Fiction was quite simply a master class.Indeed i throughly enjoyed Kill Bill Vol 1and was looking foward in anticipation to the second helping.however i was bitterly dissapointed with what arrived.Kill Bill Vol 1 set the scene, it was a fantastic visual expierance and a thouroughly enjoyable ride.The absence of your typical Tarantino dialogue was replaced with sublimely clever visuals, the interactions between the main players allowed you to hear witty conversations take place without a word being spoken.Vol 2 has very little, in my opinion, to offer.it was good to see Madsen back and Carridine puts in a good performance by being slimey and irritating every time he appears on screen (""performance""?). Daryl Hannah is excellent as Elle, and the movies one saving grace (the allways outstanding) Uma Thurman, is as ever wonderful. However aside from the cast one has to say ""so what?"". Increased dialogue??they might as well have just shut up because there was very little of interest to say.Tarantino, the worlds most popular self confessed nurd,had his nurdiness turn around and bite him hard on the ass.the first installment was nurdy cool the second, just plain nurdy.Truth sirim?Please.Night of the living dead?its been done.the time hardened professional hitman and one of the worlds greatest killers playin Kindergarden Cop?Please.admittidly the scenes with Gorden Liu are very enjoyable, entertaining and downright funny and it here that Tarantino succeedes most in paying homage to his treasured Kung Fu genre.However this isnt enough to make this movie great, it isnt even enough to make it average.i walked away after viewing it(not during it as i was tempted to do) and had what alcaholics call, a moment of clairity....it was the first time i had watched a totally forgetable Quentin film.A sad day.Lets hope that Vincent and Vic can restore some of my faith in humanity.a forgetable 4 out of ten and not worth the effort.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
833,callaghd,This movie got Derailed along the way somewhere.,6,27 April 2004,"Kill Bill Vol1 was a very very good movie. It was violent, but violence with a purpose of redemption. It was an action thriller with the rare topic of a plot. I also liked how the director mixed Japanese-style Animation with live-action. This created a unique way to tell the story. That was certainly part of the charm and mystique of the original movie.Kill Bill Vol II was tried to be made into a drama, straying away from the original piece. I just never bought into that much. The acting was not that great as well. Just a little too 'Hollywood'.The ending buildup, which of course should have been loaded with action, was kind of a let down, in my opinion.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
834,larshaun,You can be a QT fan and NOT like this movie!,6,1 May 2004,"SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!If you didn't like Kill Bill volume 2 (KBv2) too much but loved the first, you're not alone. Unfortunately the most common defense I hear by supporters is that if you didn't like it, you didn't understand it (as if it were Shakespeare) or you're a simple action-movie junkie who needed a fix.I've enjoyed many other films where dialogue successfully keeps the film engaging and interesting, driving the plot forward (i.e. Miller's Crossing, Chinatown, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Reservoir Dogs etc.) and chuckle at this poor attempt of KBv2 to do the same (yes I know QT did Reservoir Dogs).I can appreciate nearly any kind of film type in what it tries to do, as long as it does it WELL. At first, I didn't know what to make of KBv1 because it didn't have the usual QT banter we're all used to. I wasn't sure where he was going.It didn't matter in the end because the action was more than satisfactory, and some of the best communication in the film was subtle and not endlessly over drawn: Oren Ishii and Beatrix's profound respect for each other as warriors behind the HoBL, Beatrix's deep appreciation of Hanzo's assistance towards reaching her goal, Bill's mysterious and omnipotent puppeteering in the background in key scenes... you didn't HAVE to be knocked over the head with a play-for-play explanation as to the motivations of the characters - a lot was inferred.In KBv2 however, nearly everything is explained to us as if we're eight year olds. Talk talk talk talk talk. In Miller's Crossing, the dialogue is cleverly written and serves to constantly reveal layer after layer of it's complex and twisting plot with hints of symbolism throughout to reveal the emotional state of the characters.In One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, the dialogue-based script (based on the excellent Kesey novel) successfully holds up to light the conflict created when one tries to inject individualism into a repressive system designed to force the masses into conformity. It's entertaining, disconcerting and unpredictable all at the same time.So here comes KBv2. I know it's not meant to be particularly deep, but it decides to put aside the rock'em sock'em excellence of the first film to spoon feed us the plot details in the second. Well that can work better if the dialogue had something to offer - sadly, KBv2 for many it seems, does not. It's often over drawn and heavily in need of editing (why take so long to make a simple, barely important point?).Bill's parables, some of which are interesting (Clark Kent), take faaaaar too long to say something. By the end, everytime he opened his mouth you knew he was going to just begin babbling off another 5 minute story (""the truth serum doesn't take effect for two more minutes! babble babble babble""). The mexican pimp only adds to the tediousness of it all. Budd didn't say one memorable line the entire excessive time he was on screen (except the 'and we deserve to die shown' in v1).While KBv1 said a lot (despite some cheesiness) by saying less, the excessive talk in KBv2 could've served the audience better by being tighter and more engaging.The other main disappointment of KBv2 (when compared to KBv1) is in the way it handles it's ""genre homage"". The Japanese samurai attitude is well represented in v1, as is it's nod to Japanese modern pop culture, along with the taste of 70's american pulp fiction (glasses, van, music, Vernita). In v2 we get a taste of old school Chinese film influence which is the highlight of the movie.But I take a strong exception of KBv2's attempt to be compared to the great spaghetti westerns, which makes up the theme of at least half the movie. Besides being in a western setting, mimicing the music, and maybe biting a few camera shots and angles, it has NOTHING to do with the Sergio Leone/Eastwood classics. Go watch the movies yourselves (Fist Full of Dollars, A Few Dollars More, The Good the Bad and the Ugly). You don't ""feel"" none of that greatness in KBv2.For instance, there's no one as pitiful as Budd in those movies. Also, there's no character presented with the awesome presence of Eastwood's ""Man with no Name"" character. There's no intensely skilled and confident antagonist like Lee Van Cleef (who at least proves his skills by doing something on the film, unlike Bill). The style and coolness factor of those films is DEFINITELY not in KBv2, which only adds to the disappointment of what's left. Even Sam Raimi's ""The Quick and the Dead"" is a much better homage to this genre.I didn't like how we are to assume that a character deserves their title as a world class assassin. Oren Ishii -now she deserved all the awe and respect we gave her by the end of the KBv1. She is by far the only DiVA (besides Beatrix) to be fully fleshed out. The Metal Gear Solid approach to give us background on the villain was successfully used with her, and I wanted it for all the DiVas and Bill. Do we get it? No... too much time instead is wasted on unedited dialogue and a weak Western side plot.Budd's character - we're supposed to assume he's a great DiVA assassin? Throw us a friggin bone to chew on QT! After Oren Ishii's innovative background introduction, can we see at least ONE awesome flashback of Budd in top form? Something where he's not a portly oaf, slobbing along cleaning up dirty toilet water? Contrast is what's missing to fully appreciate his degradation because we don't have a clear point of reference to compare him to. So for 30 minutes of the film, we see him arching his eyebrows and mumbling nonsense... what a waste.Vernita Green - In v1. we at least get to see she's all that in the first scene of v1, but then she completely disappears for the rest of both volumes! Another great opportunity wasted to make room for endless babble. A flashback showing her origins and entry into the DiVAs was SORELY missing. A great story wraps up loose ends like that, and to tell O.Ishii's story fully without giving the others a near equal treatment is just plain sloppy, let alone the fact that the alternative given was far less entertaining.Elle - Her constant presence in v2, along with a presentation of her disposition in v1 was at least a good attempt to flesh out another DiVA. I enjoyed what was there, but would've also like to see her and Bill's past relationship highlighted. A minor request, but at least her scene with Pai Mei was included.Bill - As much as I liked him in v1. I disliked him more in v2. As a character, he had all the potential in the world but comes across as extremely underwhelming of a main villan. Like Budd, we get nothing to show he's the most dangerous man in the world.With Hanzo's eyes trembling at the suggestion of Bill in v1, after seeing what DiVAs like Vernita, Elle and O.Ishii are capable of under his leadership, after seeing Beatrix kill over 100 dangerous people just to get at him, THIS is all we get?!?!?! How underwhelming can a main villian be?!
He sits around playing the unassuming assassin who blows his Kung Fu flute and intimidates by cutting sandwiches with a butcher knife, all the while just talk talk talk talk talk on end, non stop... shut up already please and get to the point. Screw that, throw us a friggin' bone QT! I understand that a scene of him in hardcore killing action was cut - it might've helped, but still he disappoints. And to go out like a punk at the end of KBv2 (some elaborate beach fight with Beatrix was not filmed either). Oh man what a waste. Beatrix kills dozens of enemies just to take out Bill in seven seconds at a coffee table by attacking his heart (corny symbolism)... booooooo!KBv1 wasn't particularly deep, but it found it's purpose and pulled it off well: it had many innovative presentation styles, an unexpected anime sequence, a death attack theme riff to get us pumped for the ensuing battle, perfectly layered and memorable musical themes, PLENTY of exciting action, and interesting, memorable characters (Vernita, O.Ishii, GoGo, Hanzo, Crazy 88s, Buck, Sophie, a mysterious Bill, Elle the nurse, even ""Charlie Brown"" etc.).KBv2 is appallingly weak in comparison. Innovative presentation styles? The B&W church scene is a nice unique intro but WAY to long at 30+ minutes (plus the HoBL B&W takes away some of the uniqueness for the series). Pai Mei's scene is infinitely awesome, but the burial scene is just above interesting. The remaining 80% of the flick is just a standard movie.
Memorable music? Only one of the themes in the final credits caught my interest... notice how there is no buzz about the music like the film before? Even the death musical riff feels out of place... Beatrix doesn't kill anyone with it! The serviceable but forgettable music in v2 is definitely a disappointment. Compare that to KBv1:Bang Bang in the opening credits - Twisted Nerve's evil whistle tune in the hospital - The soft humming melody when the Bride sees Hanzo's swords in the attic. - The Flight of the Bumblebee during the Tokyo motorcycle ride - 5678's songs in the HoBL - Don't Let Me be Misunderstood opening in the Japanese garden's final battleThat's musical greatness in one single movie! How could KBv2 be so average in comparison?!How about interesting characters? Bill went from cool unseen in v1 to boring and long winded in v2. Strip bar characters are forgettable, no one in the church opening (even the great Sam Jackson) raises an eyebrow, her husband-to-be was a joke, the mexican pimp was a waste, Budd was just plain blah with no background story, the Korean assassin added nothing, and B.B. was a one-dimensional, smile-happy character as the emotionless Nikki was in v1. Pai Mei and Elle are all in the movie that are memorable.KBv2 was not wrong for going in a different direction, it's wrong in the execution of it. While not as bad of a sequel as Reloaded and Revolutions, it has too many problems from the gifted filmmaker to be as basic as it is.
There are people who obviously liked, loved, or are enamored with KBv2... I have no qualms with you. But try not to paint every critic as a disappointed action junkie. What QT tried to do in v2 is actually more difficult than making a decent action film sequel, but the payoff could've been more satisfying, and in my opinion it misses the mark.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
835,cherryboxs,movie industry greed has struck again,7,1 May 2004,don't get me wrong. I liked the movie and loved all the movies it was inspired from.  When we are asked to come back a few months later to see the ending of a great vol.1 I am game. When we sit thru 137 minutes of decent pacing I suddenly realize that hey this would have been a citizen kane of martial art flicks if only we we allowed to see the 3 hr version all at once! Trim a bit of flick lets see it all at once and we have a flix that tops/matches pulp fiction. But then again it is a business first and fore most.,Kill Bill - Vol. 2
836,gsp_222,Really boring 2 hours and 16 minutes,2,13 June 2015,"I think Kill Bill vol.1 is the best movie of all time for me, on the other hand the sequel is really awful. It's so boring and there is no action, everything is predictable. Bill is boring as hell and he just can't shut up, talks nonsense through the whole movie. There is no single interesting character, the teacher of Uma Thurman was not funny at all and also was boring. I think everything would be great if it was only Kill Bill 1, even though Bill is not shown, audience can imagine their whole life what happened, and not see this awful movie. All the scenes are far too long and mostly don't make any sense at all. So to warn you guys , PLS don't see this movie.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
837,Mr_Bisto,Truly Superb,10,7 May 2004,"After viewing this motion picture, I felt complete. It had taken almost six months to watch this movie as a whole, but it was worth the wait. Kill Bill, as a singular film is one of the best of all time, probably Tarantino's best work. Vol.2 as a film worked well, rich in classic Tarantino dialogue, Bill's Superman soliloquy being the perfect example, less of the rapturous violence that filled number one, but made up for by the inclusion of the coolest character in the Kill Bill saga, Pai Mei. His scenes of 'cruel tutelage' shot in a 70's kung Fu movie style really demonstrate Gordon Liu's martial art mastery (yes, the same Gordon Liu that played Johnny Mo in vol.1) All is explained in this concluding chapter, with twists and turns as is to be expected from the great director and a cameo from the man called Sam. The ending of this film had to be good and it is, it is. If you haven't already, watch Vol. 1 on video or DVD, then go to the cinema and watch no. 2, then spend three days trying to remove the smile from your face. A definite five-star masterpiece, ten out of ten, 100% magic movie making.  - Bisto",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
838,jonesjimmyjones,please forgive me Mr. Tarantino,10,15 May 2004,"After watching Kill Bill Volume 1, I felt as if I had been raped. While it certainly did hold my attention, and quenched my most primal urges, the sentient part of me was disgusted, and I felt truly betrayed. Either that, or Tarantino had completely lost his mind.After seeing Volume 2 (to which I was dragged kicking and screaming) I am ashamed to have pre-judged. Suffice to say this movie complements the first in a way I could not have imagined.I usually leave the movie theatre with the feeling that I have been manipulated into embracing some perverse, often self-contradictory, ideology. Not tonight, though, this one is honest, and explores a subject taboo in Hollywood.Congrats Mr. Tarantino, you are Champion. ...both films together, 10 out of 10.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
839,sadamek-1,What a huge disappointment,1,17 May 2004,"First, I should preface this by stating I am not a Tarantino fan. I think he is a great director who too often tries too hard to create culturally iconic images which are over-shadowed by batches of tired dialogue laden with uninteresting babble which in his own mind makes him some sort of genius. I will also say, to the contrary, I am a huge fan of Reservoir Dogs, which was truly groundbreaking and entertaining. However, so few people had seen it before Pulp Fiction was released, that the latter film was credited with revolutionizing the ""time machine"" style of plot progression. For those who saw these films in chronological order, it is clear Tarantino simply recycled the same formula that made RD such a great film and slapped it on top of a fairly weak and rambling plot with famous actors that depended on ""cool factor"" to keep viewers interested in PF. I encourage anyone to go back and view PF now...it's one of the most outdated and overrated ten year old movies around.On to KB Part II. Kill Bill 1 was awesome. Everything from the plot, to the bloody anime, to the fantastic sword fights were clearly the product of someone who has studied traditional Kung Fu films in depth. Even the yellow jump suit (a la Bruce Lee in Game of Death) was right on the money. I was excited to see what Tarantino had in store for Part 2 and was ultimately let down completely. Where did all the action go? No lengthy choreographed fight scenes of note--the Hannah/Thurman scene in Madsen's trailer was more of a drunk cat-fight than a battle of two warriors--the dialogue in many parts was long, and languished into oblivion for 5-10 minutes at a time without moving the film forward, and the final 30 minutes left me looking at my watch every 5 minutes and praying the movie would end soon. Did we really need 20 minutes of pseudo-intellectual babble about the trials and tribulations of Bill and The Bride's relationship? Granted, I understand the point was to expose her softer, emotional, maternal side even in the face of her enemy, but for crying out loud, take it outside and settle it alright already!Ironically, walking out of the theater, I couldn't help but thinking that Part II was a completely different movie the Part 1. Ironic because they are one in the same film. It seemed to me the few elements I disliked in Part 1 completely took hold of Part 2. Perhaps it was a yin/yang thing he was going for, but for my taste, the yang really stunk it up! Aside from about 4 scenes (buried alive, anything with Michael Madsen, the ""surprise plot twist"", and the funny, but all-too-short training-with-the-master segments, the other 75 minutes of this film were fairly awful. This is probably the most disappointing film I've seen since the turn of this young century.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
840,qt_one8tytwo,"Great acting, writing, and entertainment makes a great ending",9,21 August 2004,"Going into this film, I expected another kung-fu action flick with Tarantino's creative flare thrown in the mix like the first one. However, I found that this movie was completely different from the first. Where the first lacked in much character development, it was made up for in Kill Bill: Vol. 2. The performances from every character were right where they needed to be, and, not uncommon for Tarantino movies, the dialog was witty when it needed to be witty, sadistic when it needed to be sadistic, and interesting the entire time. The audience can really feel the successes and pain of Uma Thurman through her terrific acting.Even if you haven't seen the first Kill Bill, I recommend watching this. I would not be surprised if it was nominated for an Academy Award for it stood alone as a powerful movie. 9/10.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
841,The_Nay-Sayer,That Crazy Tarantino...,10,27 May 2004,"Though I consider Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2 as separate movies I view them as part of the same Tarantino ""era"" and so therefore whether I like Volume 1 better or not I still believe that Tarantino is continuously bettering himself. This movie continues the trend as his films become increasingly emotional, mature and beautiful. Much like with Vol. 1 Tarantino outdoes himself in every possible way, the casting is better, the script is better, the music is better, the cinematography is better.Tarantino has become the master of the emotional roller-coaster movie, both Kill Bill Vol 1 and 2 run the full gamut, mostly played out by Uma Thurman.The whole thing is just great. I'm just worried about the inevitable let down if he makes a movie which doesn't live up to the standard he's been setting for the last ten years.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

As a militant film fanatic, and fan, I defy anyone who knows anything about film, movies, and entertainment in general, to state that this is not a great film. Tarantino knows how to make a movie! I found the screenplay for this film to be so powerful and well written, that I haven't been able to enjoy any movie I've seen in the theater since. Kill Bill volumes 1 and 2 are a breath of fresh air amid stinky, overbloated, cinema of Hollywood today.I can't wait for Tarantino's next project.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
843,stevenmejia007,Mostly deception,8,2 June 2004,"*SPOILERS* *SPOILERS* First of all i apologize with the fans of Quentin Tarantino, cause the guy has his talent but in this movie he falls down a little bit, is like Matrix Revolutions compared with the first and second Matrix films. Kill Bill vol.2 has his good moments but for god sake Quentin, Uma Thurman get a shot in the chest with a shotgun at close range and mysteriously hours later she has not even scars, that is the error that i hate most in this film. The greatness of Kill Bill vol.2 is in the flashbacks and the unforgettable fight scene between Beatriz and Elle (the best of the film), Master Pai Mei is a great character and i think that he should had more time in the movie, The character of Bill played by David Carradine is the best in the film and i think that he deserves a Best Villain nomination in the Mtv Movie Awards, Uma is Good but not great, but in the other hand Daryl Hannah steals the show with the character of the coldess heart killer Elle and Michael Madsen makes a good performance for a comeback in his career, at the end i grant 7.5 of 10 to this Tarantino flick.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
844,michigan_movie_kid,An Odd Pleasure,7,2 August 2012,"When I tell people what my favorite movies is, my answer varies. One of the answers I will give them is Kill Bill, without saying Vol. 1 or Vol. 2. If you are a fan of the first movie (like myself) be warned: this is a completely different kind of movie! The first time I watched the movie, I did not enjoy it. The second time, I enjoyed it quite a lot. This movies contains long stretches of dialog, with only a few scenes of so called ""kung-fu action"" mixed in. This movie definitely gives us a more personal view of The Bride, and explains a lot of open-ended questions from Vol. 1. That being said, the movie does have some less than exciting parts. For example, every scene with Bud (in my opinion). Along with this, Beatrix and Bill's love story is less than desirable. Especially all of their attempts at killing each other (which, spoiler, she does in the end). It is kind of a sick love story meets a kung fu movie meets a dialog piece, but is an enjoyable watch in the end.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
845,ghostman211,Is this what we expected?,6,10 June 2004,"I was really looking forward to see this movie after seeing vol. 1 but it definitely didn't accomplish my expectations. Yeah, the story finally unfolds but when the movie ended, I realized that it wasn't so satisfying for me, compared to the rich and dynamic vol. 1. Yes, I think that the second part of the movie was kind of slow-paced...Next thing which disappointed me was, that: SPOILER!!!!WARNING!!!!SPOILER!!!! only one person died by black mambas handEND OF SPOILER that I kind of disliked after (in 'masterpeasely' way funny done) bloody prologue...and I'm not any gore maniac, believe me...And what I did like about the movie?

846,Wasta69,Don't Mention Pulp Fiction...,7,13 August 2004,"So we come at last, to Tarantino's cinematic fantasy, His parody of Classic films has reached new heights. The amount of Homages in this film is incredible - Daryl Hannah's Character must be a wink to the 1974 revenge flick 'They call her one eye'. Kill Bill itself is rumoured to become a trilogy in a 'dollars' style. The one thing that really shows the brilliance of this film is the face-off with Bill, okay so the dialog is a bit Hammy by Tarantino standards (see - Superman anecdote) while not bad is slightly out of place.*SPOILER* Anyway just as you wait for the huge showdown the death of Bill. It ends, The bride wins and its over. Just like that. B+Uma Thurman: ***+ slightly inhuman, but a good performance Daryl Hannah:*** dosen't say/do that much but suitably evil David Carradine:**** Perfect Tarantino Character, A 'Baddie' but very likable Michael Madsen:**** Again Perfect Tarantino, very dark not at his best but hey, it's Madsen for *&^% sake!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
847,Brandonez303,Too Much Talking?,7,16 March 2006,"I really enjoyed Kill Bill Vol.1 because of its over the top music, violence, and directing. Kill Bill Vol. 2 was good, but my only complaint about the film was the extended dialog. It seemed as if Tarantino was trying to fill space and extend the length of the movie. The main scenes were with Budd at the strip club and the dialog between Bill and Uma Thurman before the final fight. The sometimes pointless dialog made parts of the movie boring and quite un-enjoyable. Maybe I'm missing some greater meaning or underlying message, but overall it just made me think less of the movie. I would enjoy to hear your thoughts and comments on the subject.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
848,f0reelfosho,"A triumph, both Volumes together are 1 of the best films ever",10,9 August 2004,"Kill Bill. Wow what a movie. Volume 2 starts off with a the little bit of the beginning of Volume 1, and goes to ""The Bride"" driving a car and reciting a few cheesy lines as in ""I went on with what the movie advertisements referred to as a roaring rampage of revenge"" and of course ""When I arrive at my destination, I am gonna KILL BILL."" The wedding scene was a good way to start the film. We get to see Bill's arrival in the chapel and some great dialogue with Bill and the Bride and we see the Bride's fiancée. The last shot of the chapter though is phenomenal. The Vipers heading into the chapel with their guns is just a great shot, and I'm sort of glad that they didn't show the massacre. Next we see the Bride's, (Ok now I'm going to start calling her Bea) next target, Budd. A trailer trash brother of Bill who works in a strip club. Though I didn't like the scene in the strip club we kind of started feeling sorry for Budd. Michael Madsen does the role very, very well.The burial scene, wow that was a great scene and brilliantly done.The Pai Mei bit are one of the best parts of the movie. Gordon Liu does a fine job playing the uptight Chinese trainer for Bea and the whole chapter is fun to watch. Elle's chapter is probably the most fun to watch. Daryl Hannah who plays the downright b*tch Elle Driver is just fabulous with the role. The whole Black Mamba speech which she got from the net with a notebook is priceless.The Elle vs. Bea fight is fun, fun, fun. It's dirty, raw and fun to watch. The conclusion was finely done, better than in the script.The Bill and Beatrix confrontation is probably my favorite part of the whole film. Uma Thurman just seems so natural in the role of Beatrix and definitely deserves an Oscar nod for this emotionally challenged role, I mean the scene where she sees her daughter is just an example of how GREAT she is in this movie. David Carradine is very charming as Bill, who has some of the best lines and dialogue out of all the characters. I thought the solution between Bea and Bill was beautifully done and I'm not disappointed with the film one bit. Tarantino is just a man who really loves movies and Kill Bill is a celebration for everyone who loves movies.Still so far the best film of the year and one of my favorites ever.10/10",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

I've enjoyed Reservoir Dogs and found Pulp Fiction entertaining stuff. It's just that his choice of films doesn't quite sit with me. Now that you've read that, add 2 to my score if you're a fan.Kill Bill Vol.1 was good slapstick stuff. Pure revenge and silliness to boot.Kill Bill Vol.2 was really, really average. I found myself feeling completely uninvolved. Bill's script was unwieldy and lacked any real substance. Michael Madsen's character history had no place in the film. I agree with someone else's comments about the film needing to be 20 minutes shorter or so.I can't say I'll be in a rush to watch the second part, but would happily view the first one again.I've have to give this a 5 out of 10.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

The music in the background makes every scene seem so real and almost like you are there. The action and fighting is amazing and incredibly entertaining. The characters are actually pretty funny, and I almost identified with them. The camera shots are absolutely stunning. Altogether, this is a movie I wish I haven't seen so I could watch it again with the same feeling I had the first time. That feeling was utter astonishment at the beauty of this film.

Mister Quarantino just rips off his own favorite movies and puts them all together into something that is too long; too much boring conversations and one cliché after the other. If you have seen all the movies he has (like Once upon a time in the west; Peckinpah-movies; Hong Kong-movies etc etc), there is no surprise at all. The ending is a anti-climax. Of course, he has a very good cameraman and good actors. But let him try to make a film without guns, swords, fast cars and violence. A Dogma-film for example. A real story, about real people. I don't think he is capable too make something out of that. The thing what I dislike most about Quarantino's movies is the senseless use of violence. It gives you nothing to think about. It has no social relevance at all. Compare this with Peckinpah or Kubrick, to name a few real masters. Just violence and endless talking; it is not enough.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

This great film touches on the eternal theme of love and its complicated struggles, all through the symbolic world of serial assassins. Carradine portrays a stunning villain, who like many of Q.T.'s bad guys, we desire to associate with. Thurman herself continues the passion carried on from first part of the film. The ability of the film to blend genres and still maintain a complete and functional story and style is very commendable.Also, deeper meaning is a waiting for those willing and able to look for it.

854,radiofile,Fantastic.. (BEWARE spoilers below),10,31 January 2005,"I'm called Bill ... and I read some hype about these films and thought - s%^t - a silly film, by an over hyped QT...I accidentally watched KB 2 and was blown away by it.. I watched KB 1 and was less impressed - but could see the point that the extreme violence has a comic book character to it. The only really jarring note to me is the end of KB1 how Oren - Ishi (SP?) is 'finished' in the beautifully snowy garden.But KB 2 has a depth and a maturity to it that still sends tingles up my spine. OK, it's not the real world but what do we watch movies for. All the actors are great .. I don't know why people dislike Pei Mei by the way, I find him an 'old school Gentleman' - merciless, but with his own rigid code of honour. He does nothing that is sadistic or out of character..oh and the humour is there also, in the first fight scene with Uma.. The music is fantastic, and it took the second or third viewing for me to appreciate the humour (maybe graveyard humour, but humour nonetheless..)Uma crossing the road after emerging from the dead, with dust flying off her clothes and calmly sitting down and asking ' may I have a glass of water please'... The first fight scene with Kiddo using a frying pan as a shield.. etc etc.. And her 'rising from the dead' was a bit of the film I have watched over and over..I am new to all this and this will do, but suffice it to say - I initially thought QT was over hyped, violent and shallow (not really knowing much) - now I would rate him are one of the all time greats. I think this is shown by the fact people either hate or love these movies.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
855,lonelywatcher,disappointing,6,6 February 2005,"Vol. 2 is disappointing, a big contrast to vol. 1. I would give vol.1 9 out of 10, but vol.2 6 out of 10.If you have ever been exposed to Hong Kong kung. fu movies, you cannot but say that the fights are too short and superficial, with no real kung fu inside. The way director QT portrays Master Pai Mei is even laughable. I'm afraid it can only appeal to those Americans who are not familiar with kung fu movies.It's supposed to be an action movie about vengeance. Then, what's the point to add so much story-telling in vol. 2? I don't mean it's not needed, but it's just too much, slowing down the pace of the movie. It's just not cool. I think more than 10 minutes of the story-telling in the movie should be cut away. And there is just too little action. After the boring Budd's dealing with Black Mamma (it's boring because there is strictly speaking no fight at all), I expect a fierce fight between Black Mamma and Elle Drive. But it is very short, and there is no real fighting with swords between them, just American beating, punching, and throwing. These two characters are supposed to be students of Pai Mei and they fight like those drunk people in bars without any skill or tactics! Rearding the plot, getting out of the coffin underground is too unbelievable. She has previously learned how to punch through a piece of wood. Fine. But there is a whole lot of stone and soil behind that piece of wood in the coffin.The weakest point of the plot is the last moment, when Black Mamma retold why she left Bill. How incredible is it to give up a whole career (though it's a career of assassin) and a lover just because you find that you are pregnant? OK, it's not impossible. But it's surely not a nice thing to do to Bill, who is the boss of the assassin group and the lover, and there is no wonder that he would get mad. So, come on, Black Mamma, why are you so mad as if everybody owes you their lives? (Actually Bill raised similar question to her and she just said she couldn't imagine that Bill would do that to her. What an answer!) Yes, I know, I know, action movie about vengeance does not have to be reasonable in this kind of thing. But if director QT know that it's not that reasonable, why doesn't he just drop that part or shorten it to a minute? No stylistic fight, no thrilling music, and lots of unnecessary and unreasonable story-telling make this movie much worse than the first. I really don't understand why it gets so high a score in IMDb. Maybe there are something too particular about QT that people vote for QT but not the movie.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

The story was better, Pai Mae was awesome, and Uma was a lot better in 2. The Pai Mae scenes alone made 2 better then 1. 1 had nothing even in the same league as those scenes. And When Elle and B go at it, nothing is better. Then, the ending! It was fantastic! The little girl was great, Bill was great, the only down fall was the 5 point palm exploding thing, a little corny, but Kung Fu is a little corny.

857,Pinkgurl3533,So much better than Vol. 1.. SPOILER!!,10,26 February 2005,"Personally, I thought that the second movie was better than the first one. Vol 1 didn't have a plot, just massive killing and the revenge to kill Bill. I fast forwarded through the whole fight scene in the restaurant when the Bride was going to kill O-Ren. The scene was ridiculously long and the killing was so dumb. Like when the Bride cut off a person's arm the blood squirts out like a water fountain... unrealistic. Also I thought the whole anime scene was bad. Yes, unique because not a whole lot of movies incorporate cartoon drawings to the movie but c'mon. The second one actually had more plot than random killing. There was emotion and a story. The whole situation came out as to why Bill tried to kill Bea Kiddo. But there was still awesome action so it balanced out. I loved when she crawled out of the grave and went to the diner for a glass of water. Hilarious!! Not many movies can pull off a better sequel but this one has!! One thing I didn't understand. Why didn't she finish off the girl with the eye patch (sorry I forgot her name).

858,tbuttretro16,Tarantino bounces back with his continuation of the story of The Bride,8,24 October 2014,"When I say ""bounce-back,"" don't let that fool you completely. I thought Kill Bill: Vol.1 was decent, but for the great Quentin Tarantino, that's not strong enough. Kill Bill: Vol.2 is simply everything missing from the first volume. No Crazy 88? No over-the- top blood spewing battles? No problem. This is made up with more excellent Tarantino writing. David Carradine gets a thumbs up performance as the fiendish Bill. His strong presence gives new life to the movie. Not so strong however was Michael Madsen, as Bill's brother Budd. Yes, he was very memorable in Reservoir Dogs, but in this film I found him to be a bore. There were many scenes in the movie that I couldn't get into at all. Then later on, many scenes (like the training with Pai Mei) filled the holes of the story and created much character development. I can't write this review without mentioning the outstanding Beatrix ""The Bride"" (or Black Mamba, whatever suits) Kiddo played by Uma Thurman. In the follow- up, she shows even more color to her character, besides of course red and yellow. If your concerned about the lack of crazy action like the previous volume, don't sweat it. You'll get more out of Kill Bill: Vol.2 than you'd think.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
859,gutierez7-1,Materpiece,10,22 March 2005,"No doubt about it - Vol II is even better than Vol I. Where the first one gets a bit absurd, the second stays impressively real. Where the first one leaves you hanging, the second one gives an inspiring and completely fulfilling ending. This is Tarantino at his best.There is no real way to summarize this movie. But essentially it picks up where Vol. I left off. ""The Bride"" is continuing on her revenge rampage, getting closer to Bill himself. We find out a lot more about Bill and the events surrounding his relationship to ""The Bride."" This makes the movie more effective and the characters more real. The action, the acting, the drama, the humor, the moral, the everything of this movie is better than the first, which was very good in itself. This is a must-see!I would recommend seeing Vol I first. The second will just simply not mean as much.Wow. Great movie.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
860,Kaboomcereal,Revenge is a forest,10,6 August 2005,"At the end of Kill Bill 1, Hattori Hanzo is quoted, telling the Bride that she can get lost on the way to her revenge. This fantastic sequel shows that with its winding pathways. Her encounters with the rest of the Deadly Viper Assination Squad is different from the first movie in the saga. She acts upon different whims. Budd's character is complex for his position in the story. As she comes to face her adversaries, her actions change and the reasons change.By the end of the movie, with possibly the best quote from movies I've seen (those who've watched know what it is), The Bride is turned into somebody else. The last scene after the credits show perfectly the transformation of Quentin and Uma's character, The Bride.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2

862,loumatthews23,"Kill Bill Vol. 2 is a success. Tarantino does it again ""spoiler""",10,1 August 2014,"Kill Bill Vol. 2 is the second and final installment in the Kill Bill series directed by Quentin Tarantino. The film stars Uma Thurman as the ""Bride"" Beatrix Kiddo and David Carradine as Bill. The film picks up where the first installment left off with Kiddo on a ""blood thirst rampage for revenge"" as she describes it in the opening scene. Unlike the last film this one was not as bloody and gory in the screens. This film had a lot more dialog, which gave the viewer answers to some of the back-story questions we had about Kiddos past and exactly what happened in the church that day Kiddo was shot in the head. Unlike the last film that just narrated with Bills voice from time to time we actually see what Bill looks like and the roll he plays in Kiddo;s revenge with Kiddo finally getting the revenge she deserved. Revenge is still the main purpose in Kiddo's story and the theme of the film. Tarantino does a great job keeping the film moving at a fast pace with also giving the viewer the necessary dialog to know what is going on in the film. I finished the film without having any big questions unlike Tarantino's other blockbuster Pulp Fiction. The acting in the film I don't think was the best I have seen but it was not the focus of the movie. The film had excellent editing and use of sound effects that made the acting not as noticeable. An example of this editing is when Kiddo is being buried alive. The editor chose to show shots of the hammer close up and the hammer striking the nail to show the power of the hammer sticking the nail. Then he showed close ups on Kiddo's face as the casket was nailed shut. By cutting back and forth between these close up shots help show the fear in Kiddo as each blow of the hammer strikes the nail. By doing the editing like this it gave the viewer a feeling of power in the hammer and help show the emotion that Kiddo felt being buried alive. It was as if I was being buried myself.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
863,ex_clamation,What a waste of time watching such a stupid film!!!,1,25 June 2005,"I can't believe some people think Tarantino is a good director!!!! What a stupid film!!! I can't believe those stupid dialogs can be deep to some people...!!! The Vol.1 was somehow funny but this one is a Truly Terrible film!!!""The venom of a black mamba can kill a human in four hours, if, say, bitten on the ankle or the thumb. However, a bite to the face or torso can bring death from paralysis within 20 minutes. Now, you should listen to this, 'cause this concerns you. The amount of venom that can be delivered from a single bite can be gargantuan.""HA HA HA...!!! Incredible...!!!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
864,tecdiver-70512,Masterpiece!!!!!,10,22 February 2021,There aren't enough words anyone can say for this spectacular excellent and flawless movie. Quentin Tarantino is a genius and i hope he will always dazzle us with more movies,Kill Bill - Vol. 2
865,Lurker521,Great Movie!! If you love nostalgia you will love this!,9,1 October 2005,"Excellent movie that is superior to the first. As I walked out of seeing the first movie, I was jumping around re-enacting scenes with my friend Ed talking about ""Oh when she...."" After leaving Kill Bill 2 I was left with a different feeling; one of awe. Quentin as really made a wonderful homage to many of our childhoods with a flare rarely seen. References are abound in this movie that will make you remember instantly to the ""cheap channel"" on Sundays and you will instantly remember scenes from the past. Not to say it relies only in the past, there are many innovative concepts but this is truly a movie lover's movie. Get into this, and if possible, line the two movies up to get a feeling right up there with Shawshank or Godfather.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
866,blokeuk2003,"Kill Bill 1 and 2, poor movies but good for Asian movies being made available",3,14 October 2005,"After spending my life watching Chinese and Japanese movies i feel that Quentin Tarantino has done the genre some good even though these two movies were very bad remakes, or should i say "" scene borrowing "" ever.I don't pretend to be a expert at movie knowledge, but come on people, what was so good about these movies? Tarantino has been stealing scenes and idea's from other Asian movies for years and getting the credit for his own movies. Don't get me wrong, i think that it is good that he is putting his name to the likes of "" Hero "" and helping these films reach a wider audience, but he does borrow scenes and story lines.I was really looking forward to "" Kill bill 1 and 2 "" but after watching them i mights as well of just watched "" The Lady Snowblood "" films instead. Same as "" Reservoir Dogs "" which Tarantino stole from "" City on fire "".I would of probably enjoyed these movies more if i had not seen a million Asian movies before hand, but i just felt a little robbed as there is too many comparisons to a lot of other movies.But on a positive note i do think that Tarantino has done the Asian film market some good and he does admit that he is a big fan of Asian movies, so i will forgive him, lol.",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
867,tpolonoski-1,Beautiful!,10,24 March 2006,"Quentin Tarantino is at his best,we all wish there was a #3,Kill Bill 2 has the most wonderful music!Tarantino has excellent taste for beautiful Japanese music.My favourite was when the bride is in the coffin and that Brass music plays,Beautiful!Everyone I know loves Uma Thurman!Shes a very good actress in all her movies!I give Kill Bill 2 an excellent 10/10!More if i could! There's so many mysteries hidden in Tarantino's movies I love Kill Bill the most!I haven't seen Reservoir dogs yet but I'm sure Kill Bill is better.I don't get it how people don't like Kill Bill how could you not?Buds Hot :3 Make sure YOU vote for Kill Bill 2 or 1 so it can be #1 MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!!",Kill Bill - Vol. 2
