0,bkoganbing,The parenting thing,3,7 April 2016,"Plot premises such as we have in Daddy's Home usually are reserved for more serious type films, father and stepfather rivalry for the affections of the kids. I also can't think of a stepfather in real life like Will Ferrall who just let's his wife's former husband move right on in.Back in the day Linda Cardellini was really taken by bad boy Mark Wahlberg who is still something of an overage kid. And I'm sure the sex was great. But after two kids come and all the issues with them that inevitably occurred it's Wahlberg who decides he's really not cut out for the parenting thing.But after Ferrall lets Wahlberg stay with them it's like Cardellini's kids with Wahlberg have two competing dads. And Ferrall's losing ground. The whole thing is just dumb and juvenile. Wahlberg's hunkiness and Ferrall's comic talents are sadly wasted. When a stray dog that Wahlberg names Tumor because he grows on you is the best laugh in the film you know you've got trouble.",Daddy's Home
1,SnoopyStyle,not that funny but great pairing,6,9 November 2016,"Brad Whitaker (Will Ferrell) is a mild-mannered radio executive struggling to be loved by his stepchildren. The children's biological father Dusty Mayron (Mark Wahlberg) comes to town. Despite reservations from his wife Sara (Linda Cardellini), Brad invites him to stay. Dusty starts manipulating and overshadowing Brad. Brad's inability to have children is another way to diminish him. Dusty brings them to his friend fertility doctor Emilio Francisco (Bobby Cannavale). Leo Holt (Thomas Haden Church) is Brad's unhelpful boss. Griff (Hannibal Buress) is a handyman who ends up staying in the home.Ferrell and Wahlberg are a great duo. The jokes don't really hit that hard except the dance off in the end. The great thing is the duo. They have great chemistry together especially when they end up in a bromance. Despite not being terribly funny, it would be great to see a sequel with the guys struggling together which is what happens in the last act of the movie. That's the best part of this movie.",Daddy's Home
2,Horst_In_Translation,"Sometimes very funny, at other times just try-hard",6,24 November 2017,"""Daddy's Home"" is a 95-minute award-winning comedy movie from 2015 that recently returned to the headlines because a sequel is coming out these days that adds the legendary Mel Gibson to the cast, but we will talk about that one later. Today the focus is on this one we got here. It is among the most known career works by writer and director Sean Anders and the story can be summarized quickly. Will Ferrell plays a family man, only problem is the two kids are not his, but from his love's previous relationship. And when that man (played by Mark Wahlberg) enters the family's life again, it is not helping Ferrell's character's plans at all for the kids to finally accept him as their co-dad if you want to call it like that, especially as Wahlberg is (apart from the issue of responsibility) the perfect man, but not really the perfect dad. This is 100% about the comedy for me. There were some moments where they slightly tried to make a statement on good parenting and emotions, but these were really not too memorable at all. But it's fine as the film never takes itself seriously at all. Ferell is the MVP here without a doubt, but he also has the best material and he only has very few moments when he is missing the mark. It sure helps too that for the most part he is next to a relatively limited actor when it comes to comedy at least.Some parts I liked a lot indeed. For example the very ending with the inclusion of John Cena and the turned tables. Or also the ""racism"" parts about the Black buddy. And there are more fairly hilarious sequences for sure. You will recognize them when you see them. Oh yeah and Linda Cardellini is still as sweet as it gets. What else? Sadly, there is negative too. The film is pretty generic and predictable at times, like with the big conflict in the second half that has Ferrell's character somewhat move out. But did anybody think that Wahlberg would really take his place and then the film ends? Or that he won't fail again with responsibility? Hell no. Even if that was a nice idea to turn the tables again. There weren't really any moments at all when the cast disappeared into their characters that much that I felt like I was watching genuine, actually existing people. Admittedly you cannot blame the actors too much as the script's constant craving for humor made it really difficult for them. There are two sequences that certainly can be considered among the film's defining parts, but both went horribly wrong, namely the basketball part (small cameo by Kobe Bryant) and the dance parts near the end (Ferrell's character would never ever have dances topless there all of a sudden). It was a reference back to the idea of dancing to solve problems and conflict, but it just felt wrong. And they quickly built in a new antagonist there to make sure we don't really see Wahlberg's character as such (anymore). We should accept him as a friend eventually. This also explains the scene after the fast forward where we also get served the idea that he really no longer is interested in taking Ferrell's character's place as he has his own family now. So yeah, I think it was an entertaining watch and this one is worth seeing once, maybe twice. Sadly at times they just did not manage to restrain themselves in their attempts to make this a funny watch and the result is sadly that it feels absurdly over the top. But luckily, the good is still more frequent than the bad and I also liked the dialogue writing here for the most part, which was smarter and wittier than I initially expected. Overall, I give this project a thumbs-up and recommend checking it out.",Daddy's Home
3,Prismark10,Keeping up with the dads,5,10 October 2016,"Brad (Will Ferrell) is the doting stepfather to his wife's (Linda Cardellini) two young kids. He does so much for them to be the perfect stepdad. They in return hate him and just as he has made a breakthrough to be accepted by them their real father arrives, Dusty (Mark Wahlberg) and he is a true alpha male.Ignoring his boss's advice to be wary of Dusty, Brad is welcoming and hospitable but he soon finds out that Dusty wishes to sideline him and humiliate and belittle him at every turn.Not sure how involved Dusty was with his kids life previously or even was up to date with child support. Maybe the ex-wife should had shown Dusty the door pronto. However his bad boy attitude with a Harley Davidson impresses a lot of people including Brad's boss.There is good chemistry between Wahlberg and Ferrell and some of the slapstick comedy is amusing enough, but a lot of it is only sporadically funny as nice guy Brad is too inept ever to be a match for Dusty.Still a nice ending when Dusty encounters a super alpha male at the end of the movie.",Daddy's Home
4,nogodnomasters,THE KING IS A GUEST IN HIS CASTLE,7,16 May 2018,"This is a light near-family comedy. Brad (Will Ferrell) is the step-dad who tries very hard at being accepted by his wife's children. Just when he is making a break through, their real father (Mark Wahlberg) shows up. He is super cool and has AC/DC swagger music. Brad works as an executive at a light Jazz radio station. Wahlberg appears to be an iron man mercenary.As expected there is a testosterone battle between the two. Sara, the wife (Linda Cardellini) reassures Brad, but the audience has to wonder if having a buff Mark Wahlberg part time is not better than having Will Ferrell all the time.The comedy is in part slap stick and at times adult as the guys drop their pants and body parts are compared with their backs to the camera. The story was formula and many jokes were on the stale side. The boss (Thomas Haden Church) for me was the highlight of the film as he tells stories of his various ex-wives in an attempt to help Brad...or not.Guide: No f-bombs, minor swearing. No sex, some sex talk. No nudity. Wahlberg shirtless.",Daddy's Home
5,kosmasp,Step up Dad,7,12 June 2016,"This is actually pretty funny. It's not the most sophisticated comedy, but you should know that even before watching this. Mark Wahlberg showing off his perks ... I mean comedic talents again. Also his muscles yes (for those who care). There are quite a few jokes that go below the belt (even literally), but it's all kept pretty light, if you don't mind that direction in general.Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg have lots of fun, playing off each other and being ""enemies"". The ending kind of could be seen as a ""things to come"" kind of thing, which might ring true, with Part 2 already announced (though the movie as I know did not make that much business in Germany at least). Still you get what the box/cover promises after all, so why complain?",Daddy's Home
6,lee_eisenberg,it is what it is,6,30 January 2018,"That ""Daddy's Home"" stars Will Ferrell as a straight-laced stepdad having to cope with the cool original dad (Mark Wahlberg) should tell you all that you need to know about it. Pretty much the whole thing is a series of gags as the two dads vie for control over the family, with no shortage of crude humor. I suspect that they enjoyed filming it, especially the motorcycle scene. I will say that when it comes to slapstick comedies about parents, I preferred ""Bad Moms"" and its sequel to this one, but there's still no lack of fun here. Good times.",Daddy's Home
7,jboothmillard,Daddy's Home,3,7 May 2020,"To be honest, I mainly knew about this film because of the Christmassy sequel starring Mel Gibson, it was rated low by critics, but I wanted to make my own mind up, directed by Sean Anders (Sex Drive, That's My Boy, Horrible Bosses 2). Basically, mild-mannered radio executive Brad Whitaker (Will Ferrell) struggles to be a good stepfather to Megan (Scarlett Estevez) and Dylan (Owen Wilder Vaccaro), the children of his wife Sara (Linda Cardellini). He is also seemingly sterile, following an accident some years ago. Over time, the children grow closer to Brad, with Dylan confiding in him about being bullied and Megan asking him to take her to a father/daughter school dance. One night, Sara receives a call from Dusty Mayron, her ex-husband and the kids' biological father. During the call Dusty discovers her new marriage to Brad and says he will be visiting the next day. Sara hesitates to let her ex-husband come, but Brad convinces her that it is important for the kids to have their father and stepfather establish a respectful relationship. When Dusty (Mark Wahlberg) arrives, Brad is immediately intimidated by his tough, muscular appearance and his charm with Megan and Dylan. Dusty repeatedly talks Brad into letting him stay, despite Sara warning about Dusty's true nature. It eventually becomes clear to Brad that Dusty is intending to drive him away from the kids and reconcile with Sara. Dusty shows Brad up constantly, including getting the kids a dog, finishing a treehouse, and making him appear to be racist. Dusty continues by trying to create tension between Brad and Sara, taking them to a fertility doctor, hoping Brad's inability to give Sara a baby will cause them to split so she will return to him. The two men do appear to reach an understanding, helping the children. Additionally, Brad and Sara are overjoyed to learn that they have a chance of having a child together after all. However, Brad is stunned when Dusty reveals that he still intends to drive him out of the family. Desperate to impress Sara and the kids, Brad spends thousands of dollars on early Christmas gifts, including a pony and the tickets to the best seats at a basketball game. At the game, Dusty once again shows Brad up, being friends with the coach of Dylan's favourite team. Irritated, Brad begins drinking heavily. During half-time, a drunken Brad is chosen to try to shoot a basketball to win a prize. Brad ends up ranting about Dusty before accidentally pelting a cheerleader and a disabled child in a wheelchair in the face with basketballs. Humiliated, Brad moves out of the house. But Dusty is rejected by Sara when he tries to comfort her and forces him to step up as a dad to help his kids. Four days later, Brad is depressed and living in his office at work. Dusty, meanwhile, is overwhelmed by the responsibilities of being a full-time father. When Dusty decides to call it quits and leaves on the day of Megan's father-daughter dance, his friend Griff (Hannibal Buress) goes to Brad and convinces him to fight for his family. Brad catches Dusty at a bar and tries to get him to come back. Dusty admits that being a father is hard and admires Brad for putting up with everything that he must go through. Brad says that being a dad with all the hardships is worth it because he is doing it for his children. Dusty is convinced to go to the dance, and he and Brad arrive together. There, they find out Dylan is being picked on by a girl named Serendipity (Reba Elizabeth Carston), and almost get into a fight with her father Jerry (Bill Burr). But Dusty acts like a father, he puts a stop to the fight by starting a dance-off. Brad and Sara reconcile, and Dusty decides to stay and be a good ""co-dad"" to his kids. Later, the whole family is happy; Brad and Sara have a new baby boy named after Griff, and Megan and Dylan have finally accepted Brad as their stepfather. Dusty has become wealthy a voiceover artist on Brad's radio station, and has moved across the road, and he and Brad are now friends. Dusty has also moved on after meeting a woman named Karen (Alessandra Ambrosio), and is now a stepfather himself, to Karen's daughter Adrianna (Didi Costine). Sara is immediately intimidated by Karen, being more gorgeous, and she is also jealous of her professions as a doctor and a novelist. In an ironic twist of fate, Dusty is now in the same position that he put Brad in a year ago, when Roger (John Cena), Adrianna's more muscular biological father, shows up. Also starring Thomas Haden Church as Leo Holt and Bobby Cannavale as Dr. Francisco. Ferrell is rather pathetic as the try-hard stepfather, and Wahlberg is smarmy as the good-looking biological dad with a hidden agenda. There are the deliberately over-the-top and humiliating moments, but there are not as many bickering scenes between the two men as there could or should have been, overall, it is not all that funny, and a little boring, a below average comedy. Adequate!",Daddy's Home
8,paul_haakonsen,Quite funny...,7,25 April 2017,"This is perhaps one of the better Will Ferrell movies in years, and I was more than genuinely entertained by the storyline as I sat down to watch it, though I did so with no particular expectations as I feared it would be another run-of-the-mill mass-produced standard comedies. But I was proved wrong, luckily so.The team up of Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg worked so well, because they had amazing on-screen chemistry, and they each brought something very unique to the movie. Will Ferrell brought his usual comedic charms, while Mark Wahlberg of course brought his rugged appeal and bad boy approach. But it just all worked out nicely together, and this was definitely a great recipe for a hilarious movie.Sure, the storyline was fairly generic and straight forward, but you quickly look past that because the is a lot of hilarious situations in the movie, situations where both Ferrell and Wahlberg get to shine in each their own rights.I was laughing hard and loudly many times throughout the movie, and if I have to pick one single scene to represent the entire movie, it would be the scene where Brad Whitaker (Will Ferrell) have taken seat on Dusty Mayron's (Mark Wahlberg) motorcycle and it loses control of it. That scene had me laughing so hard and I went back to watch it two or three times.The characters in the movie were also quite interesting, especially because their are very charicatured versions of stereotypes. But it works nicely because of the acting talents hired to portray the characters and roles. I did think that it was a shame that Thomas Haden Church wasn't given a bigger and more prominent part in the movie, because he could also have contributed a lot more to the movie than what he was allowed to do.""Daddy's Home"" is really an entertaining comedy that will you have laughing hard. And if you enjoy comedies, then you should most definitely take the time to watch it, if you haven't already done so. And regardless of if you are a fan of either, both or none of Ferrell and/or Wahlberg, then the movie is still great to watch.",Daddy's Home
9,studioAT,Cardellini saves a weak Will Ferrell outing,3,16 February 2017,"Will Ferrell is so associated with his roles in 'Elf' and 'Anchorman' that I often find it difficult to see him play other parts.However, this is the sort of comedy that he could make in his sleep and to be fair does a good job in his role.It's a one joke comedy really, with lots of irrational things happening to stretch things out. I found it odd that the DVD box touts it as being a 'family comedy' when some of the jokes are inappropriate.Ferrell and Wahlberg have good chemistry, and this is clear throughout, though the saving grace is Linda Cardellini, who I wish would make more films.This is an average comedy that will mainly appeal to those who follow Ferrell's work.",Daddy's Home
10,zardoz-13,"Far Better Than ""The Other Guys""",10,26 January 2016,"""Sex Drive"" director Sean Anders has helmed another classic Will Ferrell farce ""Daddy's Home"" with muscular Mark Wahlberg as his nemesis of sorts. Indeed, this consistently hilarious hokum surpasses their , first film, ""The Other Guys,""a half-baked, harebrained buddy picture about a couple of forlorn cops. This entertaining but formulaic laffer concerns the responsibilities that come with fatherhood. Specifically, everything boils down to a never-ending competition between a jealous biological father and the intimidated stepfather of an adolescent boy and girl. Naturally, cast as Brad Whitacker, Ferrell amounts to a hopelessly ineffectual stepfather. He struggles desperately to win over his wife's two munchkins from a previous marriage. Neither have much use for our protagonist, but he does everything that he possibly can to find ways to ingratiate himself to them.Brad Whitaker has been married to Sara (Linda Cardellini of ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"") for several months. It seems that Sara divorced her first husband Dusty Mayron (Mark Wahlberg of ""Ted"") a couple of months before she married this smooth jazz radio syndication producer. Brad has a good job, and things are going well for him until the real father of two kids, Dylan (Owen Vaccaro) and Megan (Scarlett Estevez), shows up. Dusty ignores Brad when Brad approaches him at the airport. A frustrated Brad goes home to find a shiny new Indian motorcycle parked in his driveway and Dusty at the house enthralling his children. Later, Dusty tells them outrageous bedtime stories. Dusty resorts to every sneaky trick to keep his children content, and Brad's efforts to distract them from their dad don't succeed. Incredibly, the brawny as well as brazen Dusty persuades Brad to let him bunk in their house. Sara is not happy about this arrangement. Brad is in awe of Dusty, and he tells him repeatedly to put on a shirt when he struts around bare-chested to turn Sara's head. Chaos ensues when Brad claims he can ride a motorcycle and winds up wrecking his own house when he loses control of the bike. When Brad isn't putting up with Dusty at home, he must contend with his boss, Mr. Holt (Thomas Haden Church of ""Sideways""), who spins some pretty tall yarns. Dusty and Brad pull one outlandish stunt after another to influence the children about who they prefer. At the outset, we learn that Brad cannot have children of his own owing to an incident in a dentist office. A dental technician taking an x-ray of Brad's teeth accidentally lets the camera shoot radiation at his groin. The one-upsmanship that our two dads stoop to is sidesplitting. ""Daddy's Home"" features Ferrell in top comic form. No matter what he tries to do, Dusty can always top him. The dance-off at the end is pretty funny as well as the revelation about the fourth-grade bullies who terrorize Brad's stepson. The humor relies on physical comedy quite often.",Daddy's Home
11,oscaralbert,Paramount Pictures warns American Men off certain divorcées & Fords . . .,7,7 January 2016,". . . with its latest flick, DADDY'S HOME. As F150 pick-up drivers have recently discovered, Ford is piecing together vehicles of flimsier and flimsier materials, so that they're totaled during the slightest driveway mishap, as illustrated in DADDY'S HOME. (As they say, ""Ford has a Better Idea"" for turning a profit: planned obsolescence!) In regard to divorcées, DADDY'S HOME shows us that most American working women with kids regard serial marriage as sort of an extended baby-sitting service, like ""Sara"" in this story. When they're not with the one with whom they first made babies, they MIGHT make a half-hearted attempt to make babies with the one they're with--that is, until DADDY'S HOME. But as the original seeder's absence makes their hearts grow fonder, all the cards are off the table when DADDY'S HOME, as Will Ferrell's ""Brad"" learns here. Linda Cardellini's Sara immediately gives Marky Mark's ""Dusty"" the run of Brad's home, if not his bedroom. (Such women generally Recouple only after one of the new pair is declared sterile, as was the case with Brad and Sara here.) This allows Sara to have her cake, and eat it, too. Paramount's advice to American men appears to be simple: If you're getting hitched to a divorcée with kids, make sure to bring AT LEAST an equal number of your own young ones to this new team. But if you've been ""fixed"" before having kids (and still want to parent, like Brad), seek out WWC's (Widows With Children) to avoid DADDY'S HOME fiascoes.",Daddy's Home
12,george.schmidt,Who's Your Daddy? Disarmingly funny,7,13 January 2016,"DADDY'S HOME (2015) ** Will Ferrell, Mark Wahlberg, Linda Cardellini, Thomas Haden Church, Scarlett Estevez, Owen Vaccaro, Bobby Cannavale, Hannibal Buress, Bill Burr. Frequently amusing dopey comedy with Ferrell as a far-too-meaningful stepfather attempting to win over his family goes into overkill when their real-life dad (Wahlberg giving poker face a new dimension) arrives unexpectedly to shake things up. While Ferrell and Wahlberg have chemistry to spare in their second outing as a comedy team the script by director Sean Anders and John Morris & Brian Burns ebbs and flows from odd to oddly off-paced yet there is some disarmingly funny moments seemingly on the fly improv particularly with Haden Church as Ferrell's out-there boss.",Daddy's Home
13,neil-476,Successful comedy with some charm,8,8 January 2016,"Brad is Sara's second husband, and her children are just beginning to accept him when Dusty, their father, breezes back into their life. Brad is conventional and conscientious: Dusty is irresponsible and thoughtless: he is also exciting, attractive, full of fun and, in many ways a genuinely nice guy. He is also minded to compete with Brad over the children and, maybe, also Sara.Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg pair up for a second time in a comedy which plays to their strengths. Ferrell plays the conscientious, thoughtful schlub stepfather well (apart from a section late in the film where his character dives headlong into behaviour which loses him much of the sympathy he has gained), and Wahlberg's Dusty delivers believable nice but devious: we like him despite the fact that we can see what he is up to.There's a lot of slapstick humour here and despite the fact that the best gags are in the trailer, there is still a lot to amuse. The two kids are natural and often funny, Linda Cardellini is gorgeous and suitably conflicted, Thomas Hayden Church does his dry, funny, mildly sarcastic characters again, and Hannibal Buress and Bobby Cannavale are two fun characters who one would not normally expect in a film with this plot.And the ending pleased me enormously.

14,anaconda-40658,Daddy's Home and He's Pi**ed That This Film Was Made.,4,9 March 2016,"Daddy's Home (2015): Dir: Sean Anders / Cast: Will Ferrell, Mark Wahlberg, Linda Cardellini, Thomas Hayden Church, Hannibal Buress: Daddy's home and hopefully not met with this disappointment. Idiotic comedy about man's competitive nature as step-dad Brad Whitaker, played by Will Ferrell desires to be accepted by his step-kids but when biological father Dusty Mayron, played by Mark Wahlberg, returns a predictable back and forth unfunny prat falls follows as one struggles to out do the other. Formula driven plot with a dance off climax that is as lame as they get. Sean Anders has directed better comedies in Horrible Bosses 2 and Sex Drive, which are both underrated but here even the production seems routine and uninspiring. Ferrell as Brad is his usual self in his loud payoff but the character can be identified with and Ferrell is a trooper even when accidentally electrocuted. Wahlberg as Dusty shows up on a motorcycle brandishing black leather and intimidation. Linda Cardellini as Ferrell's wife caught between the two is nothing more than a prop to be jerked back and forth. She wants a third child and obviously Dusty will attempt to fulfil that. Thomas Hayden Church as Brad's boss at the radio station is another cardboard role best forgotten. Hannibal Buress is the one supporting characters that brings a few chuckles as a black construction worker sheltered in Brad's home because of a racial situation urged on by Dusty. The message regards being a good father or step-father and coming to some sort of truce. Either way when daddy gets home, something better has to be playing on TV. Score: 4 ½ / 10",Daddy's Home
15,FlashCallahan,Looks like we got ourselves a dad-off.....,6,2 April 2016,"Brad Whitaker, after spending years of being mocked for being named after the Bond villain in The Living Daylights, is hoping for his stepchildren to love him and treat him like a dad. All is going well until their real father, Dusty Mayron, shows up, then everything takes a turn for the worse. His stepchildren start putting him second and their father first, and now Dusty will have to learn what being a good dad is about, pains and struggles. Brad will also experience once again what it's like to be second best......It was inevitable that with the success of The Other Guys, Ferrell and Wahlberg would get together again and try to recreate the magic of their first outing. And while the film is a decent comedy (a genre that I really dislike), it's inevitable that the film isn't a patch on the aforementioned one.And I fear that that's down to the laziness of the writers. They know that they have already got at least half the audience from The Other Guys that would be waiting with baited breath to see this, and it's pretty high concept, if unoriginal material that is simple and straight to the point.So we have the usual appendage jokes, Ferrell doing comedy fall after comedy fall, and Wahlberg being the epitome of everybody's dreams.And this is the films first and most fundamental flaw. If you are a father yourself, there would be no way on gods good earth that his Dusty would usurp Ferrell in any parenting way whatsoever. Yes, compared to Ferrell the man is wonderfully handsome, but is that supposed to be the joke?If the writers had a little more sense about them, they would have thought outside of the box, and made Dusty not a fly by night type of rock and roll star, for the ladies, they would have made him just that little bit more successful, that little bit nicer, so Ferrell and his tantrums would have more comedic weight about them.But then, it's only a silly high concept comedy payed for laughs, with a soppy message at the end, basically saying, we can all get along.It was okay, it made me laugh a couple of times, but it's just a little too lazy.",Daddy's Home

18,StevePulaski,"A desperately unfunny, mean-spirited slog of a family comedy",3,29 December 2015,"""Daddy's Home"" is a questionable film on all cylinders, not only for its cynical, truly mean-spirited temperament just in time for the holiday season, but by it's marketing approach. This was a film that seemed to be communicated through advertisements and TV commercials, to my judgment, a movie for young children. I wasn't alone in this assumption because, when I attended my screening, my demographic of eighteen and older were undermined by the barrage of young children in the audience. If you pay attention to the zippy, blink-and-you-miss-it previews for ""Daddy's Home,"" you'll take note that this is indeed a PG-13 film, and a hard PG-13 film, if I do say so myself. Jokes about sex, nudity, male and female genitalia, and innuendos run rampant in the film, but I just can't help but think that this is a film that won't appeal too much to people older than eighteen, who will likely perceive the premise as being too childish, nor parents of kids younger than twelve who probably, knowing full well what they're in for when they see this film, wouldn't allow their little angels to see it.The parents who decide to settle for ""Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Road Chip"" these next few weeks, or even ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" for the second or third time, will certainly not miss much if they choose to skip ""Daddy's Home."" As stated, this is a mean-spirited, downright unfunny slog of a comedy featuring two proved charismatic and capable actors exhausting the lowest common-denominator of humor. It's a tired comedy about pitting a square and a rebel together and having them desperately try to ""one-up"" one another throughout the entire course of the film. Only fitting, because this is one of the most desperate comedies I've seen all year, so anxious and rambunctious to provoke a laugh it leaves no poorly executed slapstick circumstance of situational setup unexploited.The film revolves around a mild-mannered radio executive named Brad (Will Ferrell), who has just gotten married to Sara (Linda Cardellini), a woman with two kids from her first marriage to a hot-shot, motorcycle-driver named Dusty (Mark Wahlberg). Brad has been struggling to earn the respect and love from Sara's two young children since the four moved in together, and things are only complicated when Dusty decides to drop by to meet Brad and spend a week. What unfolds is a week full of ribald situations that tests everyone's patience, but particularly Brad's, who is far too collective to say anything negative to Dusty or stick up for himself.Interesting side characters come in the form of Brad's boss, played by the always affable Thomas Haden Church, who ostensibly has an unrelated story for everyone of Brad's circumstances, Hannibal Buress's Cliff, a handymen who accuses Brad of racism under the stupidest of circumstances before proceeding to move in with him per Dusty's request, and a fertility doctor, played by the now-ubiquitous Bobby Cannavale, who tries to help both Brad and Sara conceive a child of their own.""Daddy's Home"" is a constant, desperately unfunny array that stems from the insecurity of both leads - Brad's in the respect that he's being ""dethroned,"" so to speak, in his own home, and Dusty's because he's no longer the man his children call ""dad."" Many films could be made to show the real sadness, pain, and insecurity this kind of thing does to the male ego - a story almost reminiscent of the tearjerking classic by Toby Keith ""Who's that Man"" - but the approach here is simply unacceptable. I call ""Daddy's Home"" a mean-spirited slog because it's nothing more than a showcase for buying the love and affection of children through gifts and early Christmases (quite literally); in a time when the marital success rate in America is less than a coin-flip and more and more children find themselves the victim to divorce, it's frustrating to see a film capitalizing on buying affection from children rather than naturally summoning it.But of course, the latter wouldn't inspire such a lousy family comedy to take up screens away from films late last month and earlier this month that were strong and commendable efforts. ""Daddy's Home"" is one tired joke after the next, featuring Will Ferrell, hot off his egotistical bout of playing for ten different teams in the MLB earlier this year, in a grating and consistently unfunny performance, and Mark Wahlberg in what looks to be a role he could sleepwalk through. This is their first comedy together since ""The Other Guys,"" a thoroughly enjoyable film, but their brand will need to continue to flourish into more risqué or challenging territory than a film about daddy issues taken in the most brazen and unfunny way possible.",Daddy's Home
19,Hellmant,"It's a pretty funny film, most of the time.",8,15 January 2016,"'DADDY'S HOME': Four Stars (Out of Five)The new comedy flick; which re-teams actors Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg (following 2010's 'THE OTHER GUYS'). In the movie, they play a father and stepfather; both vying for the love, and affection, of their two young kids. The film was directed by Sean Anders; and it was written by Anders, John Morris and Brian Burns. Morris and Anders previously co-wrote, such popular comedy flicks as, 'SEX DRIVE', 'HOT TUB TIME MACHINE', 'SHE'S OUT OF MY LEAGUE', 'WE'RE THE MILLERS' and 'HORRIBLE BOSSES 2' (Anders also directed 'SEX DRIVE' and 'HORRIBLE BOSSES 2'). The movie costars Linda Cardellini, Thomas Haden Church, Hannibal Buress, Bobby Cannavale, Scarlett Estevez and Owen Vaccaro. It's a pretty funny film, most of the time.Ferrell plays Brad Whitaker, a very conservative radio executive; who's also a husband, and loving stepfather. There's nothing Brad wants more, than for the son (Vaccaro) and daughter (Estevez), of his new lovely wife (Cardellini), to love him, as much as he loves them. Brad is finally starting to make a lot of progress, with the two kids, when their biological father, Dusty (Wahlberg), decides to pay them a visit; and won't leave. A bitter competition ensues; for the love of the two children, and their mother.I'm a big fan of Anders and Morris; the films they've done together, are some of my all-time favorite comedies. I also love Will Ferrell, and I really enjoyed 'THE OTHER GUYS'. Given all of those things though, I expected (at least) a little more from this movie. It has hilarious moments, and the premise is a great idea; but there's also a lot of jokes, that just don't work well (at all). Ferrell and Wahlberg's chemistry together (also) isn't nearly as effective, this time around; and some of the humor is just too mean- spirited (for my tastes). Parts of the film are hilarious though!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/3D-Xa6uhK5U",Daddy's Home
20,FeastMode,my notes,5,26 June 2019,"Meh. had lots of funny parts but lots of jokes fell flat or felt corny or forced. and the story was pretty stupid and followed the same plot formula as so many other comedies (1 viewing)
SPOILERS
common comedy plot formula: 1 couple is happy. 2 conflicts escalate. 3 husband messes up and wife is mad at him. 4 husband wins her back and redeems himself. also I normally try not to over analyze the story in a comedy movie but the part where she made him move out because he went crazy at the basketball game was just so absolutely ridiculous. There was no previous tension that showed they were having problems, all they showed earlier in the movie was that he was the greatest husband and dad of all time, but he messes up one time and she kicks him out? That makes NO sense. terrible wife.",Daddy's Home
21,Robert_duder,Sadly doesn't live up to the expectations,6,19 March 2016,"I haven't always been a Will Ferrell fan but every once in awhile a dumb comedy is okay and Ferrell tends to do that easily. I actually had some decent expectations for this because the trailers looked silly fun and had a good concept and it does. It's a simple concept but that doesn't make it unwatchable. The biggest issue with Daddy's Home is that it is painfully predictable. I mean comedies tend to be this and usually they show many of the best gags in the trailer but there just felt like there was nothing surprising here at all. The entire film rests on the two leads chemistry which is decent so it does carry the film. I suppose I just wanted some laughs to be a surprise and maybe something outside of the trailer and outside of what you might expect. It also doesn't know what demographic it is aiming at. It could have almost been a family film but is far too dirty and far too many curse words for family or even early-teens. Considering the fun and lightheartedness of the rivalry and comedy, it is disappointing. What I wanted to see was some zany physical comedy but they use CGI and really bad special effects like a gag on its own.You can guarantee the main cast meet expectations for their fans. I admit I have never seen The Other Guys but Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell definitely make an odd couple together that work for comedy. Ferrell does what he does playing the overgrown child and the wimpish fool like nobody else can and it works again. Wahlberg is perfectly cast as the smooth, suave, testosterone laden ex-husband of Ferrell's wife. The two of them against each is fun if you ignore the predictability and obviousness. Linda Cardellini plays their wife and I have to give her credit because she doesn't have a big role but she is actually almost believable that she could have been married to Wahlberg and then Ferrell and that's not easy to pull off. Supported cast including Thomas Haden Church (who should have been used more), Scarlett Estevez, Owen Vaccaro, Bobby Cannavale and Hannibal Buress are all good but very underused considering how good they could have been.Daddy's Home is simple and fun and you likely will enjoy it if you're not expecting a lot from it. No matter what kind of film you're making I think you should be making it as great as possible and Daddy's Home feels rushed and under-made to cash in which it did that. Sean Anders isn't exactly a top notch comedy director after helming duds like That's My Boy and Horrible Bosses 2 but he makes a better writer and should stick to that. However, this is better than both of those films. So check this out for a fun evening watch but keep your expectations low. 6.5/10",Daddy's Home
22,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Wahlberg and Ferrell continue to hone their double act in this generally fine comedy,7,23 January 2016,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Nice guy Brad (Will Ferrell) has settled down with Sara (Linda Cardellini) and her young offspring, the only problem being their resentment of him for not being their real dad. Gradually, however, they start to warm to him, until their real dad, Dusty (Mark Wahlberg), a swaggering rebel type, arrives back on the scene, and has to adjust to the new man in his place. They try and get on, but inevitably conflict arises and the pair find themselves in a deranged comedic battle to win the affection of Sara and the children.The Other Guys was one of those (fairly) recent comedies that didn't make much of an impression on me when I first saw it, but that I warmed to and actually grew to quite like afterwards. So this second pairing of Hollywood tough guy Mark Wahlberg and affable comedian Will Ferrell sparked my interest, to see if they could recreate the chemistry of that film. The set-up is effectively the same, with Wahlberg as the mean edged hard case and Ferrell the more gentle natured, easy going type, only here he's trying to fight against it, rather than just have a grudging acceptance of it.As a comedy, and as far as doing what it says on the tin, it delivers the goods, providing a fair dose of belly laughs at various points, the only problem is a story that fails to really maintain a steady narrative flow, jointing one scene to another without the best cohesion. This won't be a massive problem if you just pay attention for the next funny set piece, which come by like buses, along with some of the slushy human drama in between.It's another high concept Hollywood comedy, that generally works very well and paves another stone in what could turn out to be a prolific Wahlberg/Ferrell double act. ***",Daddy's Home
23,ThomasDrufke,Thunderstruck,7,12 January 2016,"I haven't laughed during a lot of comedies this year, and it's actually been a pretty average year of film in general, but I can't deny the enjoyment I had watching Daddy's Home. Much like Sisters, it has a terrific comedy duo that works perfectly off each other, and the story doesn't just revolve around stupid gags (although there maybe one too many of those). It has some emotional weight to the story, that even I bought into.Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg star as the step dad and dad of two kids respectively. The Other Guys wasn't all that well received, but their chemistry was good enough to produce quite a few laughs and get me excited for their next outing together. Daddy's Home has more heart, but also a few more really stupid gags. Every outrageous gag is pretty much shown in its entirety in the trailers, which is frustrating, but that's expected with a comedy these days. The good thing is that the dynamic between Wahlberg and Ferrell create for great scenes and laughs beyond just a motorcycle crash through a house or somebody getting hit with a basketball. I thought the timing of certain songs and music throughout the movie was handled extremely well, especially the choice to play Thunderstruck when Ferrell first sees Wahlberg.The story is absolutely as clichéd as you think it will be and it absolutely wraps up the way you think, but I was ultimately okay with that. The film did exactly what it set out to do and that's to make me laugh. Take away a few of the unnecessary potty humor moments and silly physical gags and you may have had a really good comedy with drama blended in. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my time with Daddy's Home.+Chemistry and battles between the dads+Plenty of laugh out loud moments+A lot more heart than I expected-Stupid scenes from the trailers are the bulk of the physical humor-Potty humor7.0/10",Daddy's Home

In some parts, it acts like a straightforward situational comedy, but then at other times it is completely cartoonish.

There are some funny parts in it, but sadly those parts were also in the trailer, so we are left with good bits that are no longer funny cause we've seen them all already, and a ton of lame, immature jokes such as watching Will Ferrell get electrocuted or a ridiculous dance off between Mark Wahlberg and Bill Burr. Ferrell and Wahlberg really weren't the stars of this movie because any chemistry that the two certainly have is thrown away with poor development, as well as the fact that both of their characters are unlikeable, it was hard to tell who we were suppose to root for, neither of them was really an antagonist or protagonist. The only two people who really seemed to enjoy being a part of this movie were Thomas Haden Church and Hannibal Buress, they did have me genuinely laughing in their scenes, and for the time they're on screen we can forget about how poor, unfunny, poorly edited and regretful this movie is. Lacking energy, heart and original comedy, Daddy's Home kills any potential it has, and you would be much better off avoiding it. Brad finally gets the two children of his wife to look up to him as a father figure, but all his effort is thrown away when their dead beat father returns.

The kids haven't fully accepted him yet but that doesn't bother him. When their dad, Dusty (Wahlberg) shows up with an agenda a war between the two begins. This is a hard movie to review. First of all, this is not really a typical Will Ferrell comedy, or a comedy in general for that matter. The subject matter is very serious and as much as they tried some things just can't be funny. This is a good movie that has a great message and is very heartwarming but Wahlberg's character is almost too mean and unlikable for the comedy to win out. Most of the time you feel sorry for Brad and are so angry with Dusty that the jokes get lost in the emotions. All that said though, the message is worth the watch and even though the movie is very predictable it still has an impact.

The premise is nice, while i you have to wonder how Will Ferrell's character gets to be in time to do all the daddy things and provide for his family, but this plot is just basically a set up for jokes, and there are plenty of them, and if you don't set your expectations high and just enjoy the dumb ride, this movie is just a fun stuff. Performances by both lead were good, i liked what how they created this Mark Wahlberg's character uber-cool ex. who can literally raise people from the dead and do the other uber-cool stuff that you or me or other normal people can't - funny stuff. Thomas Haden Church was superbly funny, he steals every scene. Overall, i laugh a lot during ""Daddy's Home"", probably because at the beginning i kinda lowered my expectations to minimum after seeing mainly negative reviews from critics and low rating at IMDb. But if you take a premise just as a premise for jokes, don't take this movie seriously and get all the uber-cool character actions - this movie is going to be a lot of fun.",Daddy's Home
29,ironhorse_iv,It's seem like nobody was home in Daddy's home. This comedy had little laughs from me.,6,25 January 2016,"This family duo comedy from mega-stars Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg was no 'The Other Guys' (2010). Directed by Sean Anders, the movie follows a mild-mannered, devoted stepfather, Brad Whitaker (Will Ferrell), struggling to connect with his two new step-kids, Dylan (Owen Vaccaro) and Megan (Scarlett Estevez) after marrying their mother, Sarah (Linda Cardellini). But just as his new family is warming up to him as a father figure, the kids' real dad, Dusty Mayron (Mark Wahlberg), comes to visit with his sights set on winning back his family. And, as you probably guessed, a battle for the right of fatherhood ensues in a depressing, unfunny bitter childish action. Don't get me wrong, I get that Dusty has the right to see his kids, but here is the reason, why this set-up fails. Who in the right mind, would allow, the ex to live with them, so he can have time with his kids? Not only, is the plot so easily could be solve with a strong 'no' from Brad or his wife, or settle in a legal action, logically, but it doesn't make any sense, for Brad to keep him, around, after the two started to butt heads with each other. The conflict was so drawn out, that it becomes so unrealistic and unwarranted. Not only has this gag, gotten beyond borderline stupid, but it also became too frustrating to watch. I really, don't mind, most comedies, when they do this fighting for custody bit, like 1993's Mrs. Doubtfire or 1979's Kramer Vs Kramer, because they somewhat give the subject, somewhat emotional weight; however, in this film, it's still all play as laughs. Seeing, these two fighting endlessly over the love of their children isn't that funny, it's just sad. Add, the crass, cruel, and mean-spirited jokes, and you have a receipt of a very unpleasant movie. I really couldn't stomach, watching most of this film. If anything, the trailer for this film is more interesting to watch, than the movie. After all, it showcase most of the good slapstick humor that mostly got a laugh from me. Other than that, it's not funny. The characters are all one-dimensional, over-the top stereotypical and even somewhat recycled. I really felt like everybody talent was wasted by the horrible written dialogue. Like, honestly, who in the hell, talk like Brad in this movie!? 'I'm a hot habanero pepper!?"" Who says, things like that!? At least, he's doesn't have, too many, irritating yelling and screaming scenes in this film, like his other films. I also hate the fact, that Will Ferrell's insecure Brad is mostly the same character as he was in 'The Other Guys', just not a cop. The same can be, said with Mark Wahlberg's character of Dusty. Supporting actors like Linda Cardellini got it worst. Not only does, both Will Ferrell and Mark Walhberg don't share any sign of chemistry with her, at all. She barely has any lines and barely a character. It's sad, because she's a fine actress. I hate that she has little more to do than look pretty and warn Brad that Dusty is a master manipulator. It was a very lackluster role. You would think, maybe, she would play a bigger part in the film, but no. She has no say, in anything, what Brad and Dusty is going to each other. Then, there is the bizarre & completely random subplot featuring Griff, the repairman (Hannibal Burress) who moves in with the family because Dusty invited him. Not only does Hannibal's character get really annoying with the film's overused 'racism card' jokes, but he also takes away, most of scenes that could had been reserved for Linda Cardellini's character. It could had been Sarah commentary about why it is wrong, it was, for Brad & Dusty to fight against each other than this minor character. If there was anybody, that look good in this film, it had to be Thomas Haden Church as Brad's womanizing boss, Leo Holt. He looks like he's having tons of fun and had some semi-alright jokes. Yes, he doesn't really play much into the plot, but for me, it's was a blessing, just to have, something different than seeing these two father figures fight like morons. Overall: Despite the movie, not being that funny, there are some positive messages to take from this film about, the benefits of biological and stepparents being around and getting along, and the fact that jealousy, while understandable, is toxic to healthy relationships, but in the end. Daddy's Home is a far cry from Ferrell and Wahlberg's last team-up and that's the sad truth.",Daddy's Home
30,Reno-Rangan,Step-dad versus stepped-in dad.,7,24 March 2016,"In the past for an action movie, Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg came together and now for a comedy, once again the unusual combo returned. Surprisingly the movie was more hilarious than what I thought after listening to those who saw it already. Being a comedian, Will Ferrell was as usual awesome, but Wahlberg contribution had an equally advantageous.The story was a one liner, but individual comedy scenes made an impact for its grand scale success. Generally, the scenes from the comedy films are easy to predict, so in this I felt similarly, but in the many parts it kept turning in another direction. Tried its best to avoid clichés, but we know that's impossible. Either way, it carried out some decent laughs.The movie was all about the dad versus the step-dad. When a man thinks he's finally getting along with his step-kids, then comes their real dad who threatens to take aback his wife and children. So they go head-to-head and followed by a chain of life changing events comes a suitable conclusion. But there's a loop in the end, so possibly we can expect a sequel. Knowing it was not the best comedy of the year, I was not upset either for overall movie. I can even suggest it if you are looking for a simple entertainment.7/10",Daddy's Home
31,Floated2,Above average but has its moments,7,10 September 2016,"Daddy's home was released on Christmas Day in 2015, which turned out to be quite a successful box office hit, that is pressingly has been greenlit a sequel (although that might not happen). This film is the second pairing between Will Ferrell and Mark Walhberg and one might say this pairing is better than Ferrell and John C. Reilly. Since both Ferrell/Wahlberg films have been box office hits. Daddy's home is quite average, on run time it's plot is expected though it does have its enough share of funny moments to be entertaining.The first half of the film is quite predictable and not all that funny, then once Walhberg asserts himself, the film because much funnier and more entertaining. The chemistry between Ferrell and Wahlberg is why the film is above average and enjoyable. The film is quite nasty (much cursing), but it's watered down due to it's PG-13 rating. The film is marketed at families. Many have wondered how different the film could have been had they made it more adult oriented with a stronger PG-13 rating or even R rating. Though the film may not have been as successful. Overall, Daddy's home is a good enough comedy, for fans of Ferrell should enjoy it. As for having rewatching the film later on- 2/22/17', there are definitely worthy of laughs and the chemistry between Ferrell and Wahlberg is what makes it great. This film is most definitely better on the second viewing, and now that the sequel is officially coming later, we are more than welcomed to see what that film has in store.

32,leonblackwood,"Watchable, but silly more than funny! 4/10",4,30 May 2016,"Review: This is another one of those comedies which are silly more than funny but there were a couple of scenes, like the motorbike scenes when it goes through the house, that made me laugh. The chemistry between Ferrell, who plays the loving stepfather who can't seem to get close to his two step kids, and Wahlberg, who plays the kids father and has made it his goal to win back the love of his kids and his ex-wife, wasn't as good as the Other Guys and the far fetched storyline got a bit ridiculous after a while. I didn't particularly like Ferrell's character, Brad, because he was way to gullible, to the point were it became annoying, and I also didn't warm to Wahlberg's character, Dusty, who thought way too much of himself. The whole outcome of the storyline was pretty predictable but on the plus side, it's non-stop comedy and it gets straight on with it, right from the beginning. Average!Round-Up: With two big stars playing the lead, this movie was bound to make a profit but I personally think that they could have made a much better movie with half the budget. The scenes with the real LA Lakers, just seemed like the director was showing off and he also used Tony Hawk for the skateboard scene as a double for Will Ferrell, when he electrocuted himself on the telephone line, so that might explain were the budget went. With all that aside, director Sean Anders, who also wrote the movie, certainly made a hefty profit from the movie, which is why there is a sequel planned in the new future. He also directed Horrible Bosses 2, which wasn't as good as the first movie, That's My Boy, which was awful, Sex Drive and Never Been Thawed. Judging by his track record, I'm not surprised with the outcome of this movie, and the fact that he wrote Dumb and Dumber To, Hot Tub Time Machine, Mr. Popper's Penguins and She's Out Of My League, proves that his taste isn't for everyone. On the plus side, he did write We're The Millers, which I really enjoyed, so there is some hope for this writer/director.Budget: $50million Worldwide Gross: $240.4millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their comedies starring Will Ferrell, Mark Wahlberg, Linda Cardellini, Thomas Haden Church, Bobby Cannavale, Hannibal Buress, Bill Burr and Jamie Denbo. 4/10",Daddy's Home

37,jtindahouse,Has its moments but it's no game-changer,7,26 December 2015,"'Daddy's Home' is the second collaboration between Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg, the first being 2010's 'The Other Guys'. There's no doubt the two have chemistry. What there is doubt about is how to perfectly utilise each of the two as characters. The problem is that for Wahlberg's confident, in-charge character (which he has to play) to work Ferrell needs to play the straight guy and that isn't when he's at his best. He does it well there's no doubt about it, but he's at his best when his character has an edge to him like 'Ron Burgundy' or his character in 'Step Brothers'. Playing the overly straight guy just seems almost a waste for the one Ferrell movie we get a year, even though no one could deny he still does it very well. The difference in quality between this and 'Get Hard' is noticeable. There, Kevin Hart was unable to find a chemistry with Ferrell and it just turned into the two competing with each other trying to make the movie their own. Here that's not the case. Wahlberg seems happy to let Ferrell take the reins and is comfortable just doing what he does best, with his laid back, dry sense of humour accompanying Ferrell perfectly. There are consistent laughs throughout, but perhaps not one stand out scene that will be memorable for years to come. It doesn't push the envelope as much as other Ferrell movies have in the past either. I really would love to see him always be given free rein to say and do as he pleases but also understand why that can't always be the case. If you're just looking to get your annual fix of a bit of Ferrell hilarity then you won't be disappointed. If you are looking for a game-changer, perhaps wait for the next one.",Daddy's Home

Major spoiler for Frozen in this movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,8,2 July 2019,"Seriously, they straight up give a major spoiler for Frozen (not the horror movie, the one with Elsa) in this movie as if it were nothing. What is wrong with them?!!?!?!? What if someone hadn't seen it yet?Anyway...I think people watch this as a straight comedy and hate it for being a bit painful.But although it's delightfully comedic, I think this movie has more to it than that; it's a charming story of people competing for the love of the same people and their attempts to fulfil the role of a father. The nurturing step dad verses the mega sexy biological father in a test of machismo, daring and cunning.It goes to a dark place because the pains we go through to be the best parent and spouse we can be are tough, especially as we unintentionally challenge the traditional nuclear family.Expect an explosive bout of head butting as two very different people learn to see from the other's point of view. It's an idea we've seen before but it's fresh with its handling and tone.Watch if you want a lot of cheap laughs and a very intelligent application of character, motivation and conflict.",Daddy's Home
40,alindsay-al,An average comedy that does have a nice message,5,24 September 2016,"I like will Ferrell comedies for the most part so I did want to watch this film and it is a pretty average by the numbers comedy. The premise of the film sees a stepdad trying to bond with his stepchildren when they're biological father returns to get his family back together. Will Ferrell and mark wahlberg play the two dads and I thought they both did alright jobs in this film. Ferrell was pretty funny especially when he got the chance to be a bit more crazy with his character. But when he is trying to be the normal dad it can come across as a bit forced and wasn't overall that funny. Wahlberg plays the lovable rogue well in this film but sometimes his character comes across as cliché and predictable. The supporting cast are a mixed bag, I liked the character of griff who basically becomes a third wheel in this whole situation and has some funny moments. But I actually found the rest of the family a bit annoying and I don't think they added much humour to this film. The story is pretty simple but it is pretty effective, by the end you can see the good message. However, it does come across as very by the numbers and very predictable which hurts the film. The script has some OK humour and drama but it just isn't as good as other comedies and comes across as a bit basic. The style of the film is fun in a crazy unrealistic kind of way but like this film you have seen most of this before. Overall this is a harmless by the numbers average comedy.",Daddy's Home
41,iquine,Yes. Yes I Did Rate This A 9/10,9,1 November 2017,"(Flash Review)I know that is a crazy rating for a silly comedy but the jokes were really funny and worked for me as well as exceeding my low expectations. I can totally understand rating this a 4-6/10. For me, compared to the last several dumb comedies I've watched, it actually made me laugh hard. The plot, at its core, was a good carrier for the over the top surprising and comedic scenarios. Onto the plot, which is about a step dad who is newly married to a wife with two elementary age kids and suddenly her ex-husband re-enters their lives with the hopes of winning his family back. Ferrell, who is the new husband, plays a kind-hearted, emotional and gentle man while the ex is Wahlberg who is of course strong, brash and intimidating. The two men joust back and forth trying to prove they are the better father figure with their varying personalities and skills. Cue escalating and sensational testosterone battles. Who will end up winning the family? Will the two learn any moral lessons during their many fiascos? Ferrell is on his game as Wahlberg plays off of him well; often shirtless. In fact, there was one scene where the two are talking and Wahlberg is constantly doing push-ups or pull ups. Pretty random and oddly amusing. A good reason to drag a female guest along to the movie. Ha. Above average for this genre.",Daddy's Home
42,jimbo-53-186511,"MacKay and Ferrell's sledgehammer approach to the narrative doesn't do it any favours, but it still doesn't deserve the kicking that has been dealt to it by the critics",7,24 September 2016,"Brad Whitaker (Will Ferrell) earns a modest income working for a radio company and is currently married to Sara (Linda Cardellini). Brad lives with Sara and her two kids (whom were fathered by her ex). Brad is starting to build up a rapport with Sara's kids, but before he has a real opportunity to do this their real father Dusty Mayron (Mark Wahlberg) returns which causes immense problems for Brad.For me, Ferrell is always at his best when he's cast in more natural roles where he plays likable characters (as he does in this film). He's a good actor and it annoys me that he seems to spend a good portion of his career overacting and playing irritating characters. Brad is one of life's good guys; he's got a steady job, he'll do anything for his wife and kids and he just wants himself Sara and the kids to be one happy family. Dusty is the mirror opposite to Brad and is the archetypal 'Sunday Dad'; he turns up, showers his kids with gifts, but is unable to provide them with any kind of emotional support. What follows from this point on is a kind of 'Battle Of The Dad's contest' which Dusty more often than not wins, but interestingly he tends to win the battles by using a lot of reverse psychology and he also uses Brad's good nature against him. This results in a lot of funny situations and many of these situations don't always take the most obvious route in order to get the jokes across.Within the film, Ferrell and MacKay throw in the rather sensitive subject of bullying and once again our two dads both give their two-penneth on how the kids should deal with this situation. For the most part, this is generally well-tackled and the assertion here is that bullies are cowards and that you should stand up to bullies (which is great). When it was revealed that it was a girl doing the bullying I thought that was a clever twist (as you generally wouldn't assume that a girl would bully a boy). To me this reveal on its own was surprising enough, but Ferrell and MacKay take the joke one stage further by actually allowing the boy to punch the girl and kick her in the 'you know where'. That scene made me wince not only because it was uncomfortable to watch, but also because of how poorly the plot point had progressed - why not just have the girl being the bully as the reveal and then explain to the boy that you shouldn't hit girls and leave it at that. I just felt that Ferrell and MacKay extended the joke to get a cheap laugh, but to me they both took things too far here. The character of 'Griff' features prominently, but he isn't used particularly well and is little more than a 'racism cliché' which does get tiresome.Ferrell is good here and Wahlberg is also fairly good value (although one wonders whether this was more of a vanity project for Wahlberg than anything else). Thomas Haden Church is also good in a supporting role as Brad's boss.The film does have some good moments such as the moment where Brad goes into a clichéd fit of hysteria when he believes that Griff has left the room only for Brad's boss to announce that he's still in the room which was both ironic and amusing. I also liked the way that the film went full circle at the end whereby we learn that Dusty may be about to reap what he has sown.Daddy's home has its fair share of problems but as far as I'm concerned it still delivered on what it promised.",Daddy's Home

Mark Wahlberg & Will Ferrell were absolutely fantastic together in Buddy Action Cop Comedy,THE OTHER GUYS & carry on that perfect chemistry to this family Comedy with a big heart.
Basically Ferrell is a step dad to a couple of kids & is a very timid & loving type of guy & the kids real dad comes back into the picture & that's Mark Wahlberg who is the super cool, Handsome & muscular alpha male who wants to get back in with his beautiful wife & kids & push Ferrell out & it leads to many hilarious moments & side splitting humour.This is really a very feelgood film one that really cheered me up & cracked me up & I'm a fan of both actors as Will Ferrell is a comic genius & Mark Wahlberg is one of the greatest actors working today!!!

45,AudioFileZ,Politically Uptight Correct Step Dad Vs. Hunky Passive Aggressive Sarcastic Real Dad...Funny Stuff.,7,14 January 2016,"This movie is exactly as you would imagine a Will Ferrell comedy with this title and Mark Wahlberg as the biological father come home to reclaim his brood. To be blunt, if you love Will Farrell's other comedies you'll love this, while others, may simply, turn away. But, there's much to like even if it is all too predictable story-wise.Mark Wahlberg, being in every way the polar opposite of Will Ferrell, is the perfect juxtaposition to Ferrell's trying so hard to be accepted by his wife's children. Wahlberg has proved he can be a solid straight man comedic actor, and here, given plenty of pure gold passive aggressive lines to undermine Ferrell's over-achieving need to be step dad to Walhberg's kids...well, let's say Ferrell and Wahlberg make the tepidness of predictability less of a liability, succeeding in a fairly frequent flow of laughs.Daddy's Home, like just about all Ferrell vehicles, goes too far and there will be some who find it a bit much. That's what Will Ferrell does and he's smart enough to surround himself with synergism in his co-stars. Walhberg certainly hits the right notes here as does Thomas Hayden Church who plays Ferrell's boss. There's even gold in a handyman for hire called Griff and a feral dog (pun intended of course) named Tumor.Apparently someone can write this stuff and with Ferrell presiding it is raised to a kind of lowbrow art. For all it's senselessness there's even that buried ""kernel of truth"" which weaves itself in at some, actually, key times. In the end the movie just makes one laugh while it entertains so for fans of Will Ferrell it's another solid movie if not his best. It's a comedy that goes a bit overboard and comes out in the end...succeeding. I think it's pretty darn funny. I will give it a seven with the caveat that it is pure Will Ferrell schtick which he owns and can do better than anyone.",Daddy's Home

47,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Daddy's Home,5,17 January 2016,"Will Ferrell's latest is a 2015 release that's less amusing than his boldest endeavors (The Campaign comes to mind). Let's just call Daddy's Home Ferrell lite shall we. At 96 minutes, ""Home"" as a comedy is stupid funny without being hilarious. It's like a mild hack job from director Sean Anders. Sean's leads (Willy Boy and Mark Wahlberg) are perfectly cast with a few laughs seeping through. However, the screenplay by ""Home's"" three writers is just meh. A creepy Thomas Haden Church (he plays a radio station owner) giving insensible advice is not amusing. A gag involving a dog who looks ragged while possessing silver-colored eyes is also not amusing. A scene where characters dance with each other instead of fight each other is kind of half-baked. And finally, what's with the adage of locales used in Daddy's Home. Twenty minutes in and I thought things took place in Los Angeles, California. Come to find out that New Orleans, LA was the primary setting. I guess a car license plate and Pelicans basketball gave it away. Natch.Anyway, the three main characters in ""Home"" are in a sense, labeled. Their identities are sledgehammered towards the audience as if they were types. Brad Whitaker (Ferrell) is the dimwitted stepdad, a doofus lacking self-confidence and an easy target for ridicule. Dusty Mayron (Wahlberg) is the biological dad, a manipulative jerk who deals in childcare MIA (he's also a slimy badass). Finally, Sara Whitaker (played by Linda Cardellini) is the spouse of Brad, a beautiful yet dull housewife who seems to be caught in the middle of it all.Slapstick antics of the obligatory kind ensue with Brad Whitaker crashing a large motorcycle into his house, Whitaker punching Dusty without so much as a flinch, Whitaker getting drunk and hitting a cheerleader at a basketball game (with a b ball), and finally, Whit getting electrocuted while trying to skateboard in a backyard half-pipe. I chuckled, I winced, I checked my phone, and I eventually left the theater. The whole time I thought, this flick got green-lighted because of actor notoriety. There's no other explanation.The story is as follows: Brad works as a radio executive and shares a beautiful house with his wife Sara plus her two kids (Scarlett Estevez and Owen Vaccaro as Dylan and Megan Mayron). He loves being a stepfather to them even though they haven't warmed up to Brad yet. Just as he is about to make a connection with said ankle-biters, in walks Dusty Mayron, their real father who's been away too long and is making up for lost time. Dusty I guess, works in black ops (that's what a couple of other reviews said but I wasn't entirely sure). He drives an intimidating chopper, he can build an intimidating tree house, and he has the radio voice to make mad royalties. Dusty's motivation is to get his kids back, remarry his ex-wife, and eventually give her another baby. He even persuades Brad and Sara to let him stay at their home for an extended period of time. What happens next is you guessed it, an old- fashioned ""dad-off"". Both of these dudes compete against each other for the affection of two adolescent tykes. Examples would be early Christmas for the kids (in April), complete with tons of presents including a pony. Another example would be the kids meeting Kobe Bryant while sitting in $18,000 seats (at an NBA game). Oh and who can forget Dusty telling fun, bedtime stories while slipping them each twenty bucks. I wish I got that kind of dough when I was seven.All in all, watch for a lot of erratic jokes, PG-13 fare that doesn't really push the envelope, Ferrell being Ferrell, and Wahlberg being Wahlberg. And despite feeling like a vehicle that was cooked up over a couple of days, Daddy's Home has already made a ton of money ($162 million-plus). Bottom line: Everyone involved (the filmmakers, the producers, the studio executives) is probably laughing all the way to the bank. Rating: 2 stars.Of note: I read somewhere that Mark Wahlberg has achieved enough success to the point where he's not trying to impress critics or parlay audience members. He now does movies for his family, or for his own self- satisfaction, or because he's got clout, or whatever. ""Home"" is proof of that. Also of note: For the record, I couldn't tell you whether Daddy's Home is better than Ferrell/Wahlberg's earlier screen pairing being 2010's The Other Guys. I have yet to see that cult worthy, monster hit. Finally, I have to give ""Home"" points for picking actors who look alike (this applies to immediate family relations). I get annoyed when this is not the case (see my review for This Is Where I Leave You). In reality, if Wahlberg and Linda Cardellini had children, they would probably look exactly like the young troupers featured here. Bravo to the casting department.",Daddy's Home
48,rannynm,Great Cast! Great Delivery. Perfect Family Film.,9,27 January 2016,"I really enjoy watching this funny movie directed by Sean Anders. It is pretty hysterical and enjoyable for preteens. I think adults might like this as well. This movie made me laugh because the movie has a lot of humor and the jokes are spot on. The movie is about the good step-dad, Brad played by Will Ferrell. He wants to be accepted by his family because the kids aren't happy that he is their step-dad. Eventually, they do accept him, but things change when their dad, Dusty played by Mark Wahlberg tries to come back into their life. Brad and Dusty slowly begin to start a ""Dad Off"". They try to beat one another to show the kids who the cooler Dad is. Will they fight until there is a winner or will they make a truce and end up liking each other? One of the things I enjoyed most about this film is the cast. They are really great! I love the message because it talks about acceptance. I also like the jokes in this movie because they are very hilarious. My favorite character is Dusty because he is comes off as this mean person but he is actually not so bad. Dusty makes changes throughout this movie and makes many hilarious jokes that will make you like him.The message of this movie is acceptance. Both of the dads are trying to get acceptance. Brad wants to be accepted by his step kids so they can be one happy family. Dusty wants to be accepted again after the divorce. Dusty wants to have a family, but he can be irresponsible. In this movie, acceptance is a huge thing. It takes a long amount of time since things don't happen overnight.I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars. I recommend this movie for kids ages 11 to 18. It is perfect for tweens and teens but it does contains some inappropriate mild profanity, rude humor and mild violence that make it unsuitable for younger children. I think adults will enjoy this as well. It comes out on Christmas Day so mark your calendars. Reviewed by Ryan R., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

Walburg deserves better material to work with.",3,7 January 2016,"Ferrell plays Mr. Milquetoast, working at a smooth jazz radio station, who finds himself having to play childish games of one-upmanship when his wife's macho ex-husband comes to live with them for a week.The remainder of the film is just stupid, as these two grown men basically try to out ""macho"" each other, and sink even further, ultimately trying to buy their family's love. Ferrell stages a phony Christmas, Walburg appears intimidated, and in need of a shave. Hannibal Buress moves in with them for some reason, and rears his head several times throughout, even though his character should have been kicked out of the house after five minutes. A couple of his scenes were funny, the precious few times I chuckled during this one.

50,bkrauser-81-311064,Nobody's home in Daddy's Home,3,4 January 2016,"Daddy's Home assails the quiet domesticated life of Brad (Ferrell) a step-father with the presence of Dusty (Wahlberg) the real father. Brad has just gotten his step-children to like him largely due to his ability to master the mundane tasks of parenting; dropping them off at school, making cookies for the PTA, volunteering at church etc. Dusty on the other hand is not the domestic type and seems okay with loading up the children with candy before bedtime, making a skate park in the back yard and teaching the young son to fight. The affable, feeble and timid Brad competes for the family's attention and love against a competition that seems better than him in every way.There are many ways to describe the characters of this movie and realistic isn't one of them. The two leads take the same antagonistic approach taken from their other collaboration The Other Guys (2010) accept Wahlberg's gone to anger therapy and has an affinity for shirtless workouts. He also weaves tall tales about living overseas and meeting famous people, all of which end up being true. Ferrell's hobbies include crying, flinching and saying ""oh- shucks"" all the time. He's a man that's hard to root for let alone stomach for too long, yet we're supposed to spend 96 minutes of our time hoping he can find the familial love he craves. Both men are caricatures in the worst sense of the word. They're boring and flat with no redeeming characteristics that matter. Their actions make no sense other than in the fictional SNL inspired crazy town they seemed to have come from and they easily buckle under the litany of humdrum, tired, and brainless comedy clichés.With an unfunny script, bad characters and terrible setups you can at least count on Ferrell and Wahlberg to come up with some bilious, grossly-inappropriate improvisations to stomach the banality; right? Such are the modes in comedy today where amusing dialogue and brilliant satire is replaced with something you can see at an average open-mic night. But while I must admit I am surprised how much you can get away with with a PG-13 rating, a lax policy towards the b-word can't keep the one-ups-man-ship to a palpable level; It's all so tame, so domesticated and so, so lifeless.The real tragedy is Ferrell has always been a talent that doesn't need to resort to cliché, banality or ugliness. Just when you think he's down for the count, he comes back with an out-of-left-field dramedy that works like Stranger Than Fiction (2006) and Everything Must Go (2010). Beyond that, his work on SNL (1975-Present) and the riotous Anchorman (2004) keep him well paid and well fed. Yet there's no saving this turd, it's and awful assemblage of deja vu and who cares and Ferrell and Wahlberg are either unaware or simply don't care anymore.",Daddy's Home
51,quincytheodore,"Returning in clever and fresh comedy, Wahlberg and Ferrell might just be the best surprise duo in comedy.",7,12 January 2016,"Mark Wahlberg is a wild card, he can deliver a gripping performance and worthy of award statue, then stuffs like Max Payne and The Happening happen. Fortunately, he seems to find the correct comical niche with Will Ferrell as their second collaboration produces a kind of sleeper hit. Daddy's Home uses all the awkward instances of unorthodox family and turns them into a witty charming comedy.Brad (Will Ferrell) is the providing stepdad who understandably feels intimidates when the biological father Dusty (Mark Wahlberg) shows up unexpectedly. The two compete in both subtle and blunt fights for dominance which only make matter worse for them. In serendipitous manner, similar to The Other Guys, both leads have strangely synced chemistry. They make very good characters from people expectation of macho and timid roles, then completely alter them to make a clever parody.Majority of the humor comes from the teasing of typical family comedy, yet it goes entirely in different way. There are moments where they banter about dramatic events or familiarly awkward situation in such exaggerated satirical tone. A few crude jokes are also played in expense of the characters' manhood or dignity, it's cringe-worthy yet hilariously drawing.Support characters perform nicely as well. Thomas Haden Church as the insensitive boss and Hannibal Buress as a truly random character Griff would pop out of nowhere manly to instigate or add salt to injury. With this kind of brash tone, a few of the scene might seem forced yet it usually ends up in the movie's favor due to timely satire.Daddy's Home is smarter than average family comedy, it's a scintillating medium for parody and it fully capitalizes on Wahlberg and Ferrell's enigmatic chemistry.",Daddy's Home

53,Screen_Blitz,Disappointment by a talented comedic duo,4,22 March 2016,"Will Ferrell has proved to be one of the funniest actors over the years with some of his hit comedies such as 'Anchorman' and its sequel, and Mark Wahlberg has taken on more serious roles while slipping into a few successful comedic roles, like a man living with a foul-mouth talking teddy bear for an example. These two managed to prove themselves as a cohesive comedic duo in the action comedy 'The Other Guys'. This comedy directed by Sean Anders who was responsible for the comedies 'That's My Boy' and 'Horrible Bosses 2', both of which were sad disappointments; reunites Ferrell and Wahlberg in a wild battle of Parent Vs Parent. Ferrell plays Brad Whitaker, a radio executive married to his wife Sara (played by Linda Cardellini) and tries desperately to earn the affections of his stepchildren Megan and Dylan who struggle to accept him as their step dad. Overtime, these began to work out, that is until their bad- boy biological dad Dusty (played by Mark Wahlberg) shows up and turns Brad's world upside down in a wild competition to win the affection of the children.Wahlberg and Ferrell delivered plenty of laughter during their first collaboration with The Other Guys, but their comedic talent is left to a dispiriting cutback in this one. This film aims to get audiences' laughter from seemingly non-stop pratfalls and slapstick humor that starts off funny but quickly grows tiresome before the long run. Characters crashing their motorcycles, getting socked in the face, or a cheerleader getting pounded in the face with basketball just isn't funny anymore. Now that is not to say that the two leads don't manage to branch out a few gut-busting one-liners, there are a few that had me laughing, but of the jokes sadly don't land. The children here may deliver a few potential laughs, but thats only when they are not spouting out obnoxious little one- liners or shocking viewers by dropping some swear words. As the movie progresses through this continuous battle of the two main characters desperately competing for the love of the children, it blows through these gags that grow more and more clichéd by the minute. And towards the end, the movie stops being funny. Daddy's Home is a rather disappointing attempt to reunite Ferrell and Wahlberg in their comedic duo, and probably a movie that may only be worth renting at a Redbox, unless you're an easily amused moviegoer who can find laughs in just about everything. While this movie does deliver a few laughs here and there, its not as satisfying as it should have been and definitely not the best of works by Wahlberg or Ferrell.",Daddy's Home

58,dave-mcclain,"Get your father to leave daddy's home and take him to see ""Daddy's Home""!",8,27 December 2015,"""Modern Family"" has been showing it to us on our TV screens since 2009. On the big screen, ""Mrs. Doubtfire"" talked about it back in 1993: ""Some parents, when they're angry, they get along much better when they don't live together. They don't fight all the time, and they can become better people, and much better mummies and daddies for you. There are all sorts of different families."" The Best Picture Oscar winner ""Kramer vs. Kramer"" dramatized it back in 1979, along with numerous other TV shows and movies before and since. These entertainment products reflect today's society and help people deal with the stresses and heartbreak of divorce and the formation of new and even unconventional families. Often, TV shows and movies do these things with humor, as in the film ""Daddy's Home"" (PG-13, 1:36).Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg (previously seen together in 2010's ""The Other Guys"") star as Brad Whitaker and Dustin Mayron, two dads vying for the affections and loyalties of young brother and sister, Dylan and Megan (Owen Vaccaro and Scarlett Estevez). Dustin was the proverbial bad boy who was exciting for Sara (Linda Cardellini) to date. After marrying her and giving her two beautiful children, the same qualities which initially made him appealing, made him impossible to live with and the couple split. Enter Brad, a sensitive man who can't have children, but who has a tremendous paternal instinct. He marries Sara and is a great husband and father – at least, to the extent that the kids allow. Still attached to their absentee bio-dad, the kids make Brad work for every ounce of grudging acceptance.When Dustin unexpectedly calls the Whitaker home and announces that he's flying to New Orleans for a visit, Brad happily picks up Dustin from the airport. Brad's a bit intimidated by Dustin's machismo, but remains confident in his own lovingly and patiently-cultivated position of step-dad. Just starting to make emotional inroads with Dylan and Megan, Brad is thrown off his game by Dustin's ""fun dad"" persona – and passive-aggressive efforts to make Dustin look less. Along the way, Brad gets ""advice"" in the form of humorously self-aggrandizing stories from his boss (Thomas Haden Church) and medical help in trying to expand his family from a famous fertility doctor (Bobby Cannavale), while having to deal with a handyman (Hannibal Buress) whom Dustin invites to move in and who thinks that Brad's a racist. As Brad and Dustin escalate their competition, each deals with some of his efforts hilariously backfiring. It's going to take a lot of grit, determination and cunning for either Brad or Dustin to win this ""dad off"".""Daddy's Home"" is a very funny and well-constructed comedy with a lot of heart. The movie's jokes and sight-gags range from sweet to predictably crude, are often clever and sometimes laugh-out-loud funny. Ferrell and Wahlberg are in top form. Ferrell's over-the-top patient understanding and affection-winning efforts make us root for him until we're not so sure. Wahlberg's oblique persona and shifting tactics keep us guessing. The cumulative result is a back-and-forth battle whose outcome may be predictable, but still entertains us with the method to its madness. My advice? As soon as daddy's home, get him to leave daddy's home and take him to see ""Daddy's Home"". He'll appreciate it. ""A-""",Daddy's Home

The last thirty minutes are great and the delivery from all the actors is fantastic.However, it often goes way too over the top and runs its' points right into bedrock. I'm not sure what it's focus group is.. It's PG-13, and the film has no nudity, a fair share of cuss- words, but more importantly half the lessons that 'are to be learned here' are a bit twisted;seeming to go one step beyond necessary at every opportunity. There's a couple of shady CGI moments, and the film is, as I hope it's' makers would agree, sickeningly predictable.The film out of nowhere smooths out the edges and makes a dramatic late comeback over the last 30minutes- Saving the film from a lower grade.. It has more than a few funny moments and a good cast trying their best. That's the movie.63/100 No chance at my ""top-25 of '15"". Better than ""Get Hard"", and some other, lower-end Will Farrell films, but nowhere near his best. While crude in it's methods, it somehow manages not to bury its ratings board boundaries, and maintains a leftover shred of a heart for us to find our way to the end of the line. Slightly.. Above...

63,SquigglyCrunch,"Half is Good, Half is Bad",5,23 September 2016,"Daddy's Home follows the stepdad of two children when their biological father shows up and he's supposedly much better than him. They then begin a competition to win over their family. The last half of this movie is pretty decent. There were a handful of good laughs, and by that point it'd built up the characters enough that you as the audience could somewhat relate to or at least understand the characters. They did stupid stuff but you understand why at least. Surprisingly, Mark Wahlberg is pretty great. His character is vague and mysterious, and you can never really tell when he's being genuine or not. And that's just his character, that's how the dialogue and writing make him out to be, and he's just perfect for the role. The first half, however, is another story. It's so incredibly dull and boring and nothing really happens. Sure, there are good elements to it, but when it comes down to it it's not funny and for a comedy that's not good, especially when this is the first half of your movie. I wouldn't have finished this movie, but I still did. I ended taking a break at the halfway point, going to sleep, and waking up to finish it. I could barely stay awake. There were a handful of points in the movie where the comedy seemed really forced. Lot's of parts were over-the-top, sure, but that was the tone the movie was trying to set. There weren't many parts that were just out-of-place forced for comedy, but they were still there and they kind of took you out of the movie. Overall Daddy's Home is a pretty average family comedy, if you can even call it that. Half of the movie is good, the other half, not so much. Mark Wahlberg is pretty great, but the movie tends to drag a lot. In the end I'd only really recommend this as a family movie night kind of thing.",Daddy's Home

It was still funny, and there were a few really laugh out loud moments.Will Ferrell is always great, so there is no surprise that he smashed it in this role. He's building quite a decent onscreen partnership with Mark Wahlberg after a few outings together now, and their chemistry on screen was solid in this film.The story was fun, very predictable but still fun!There's not much more to say here really.

65,estreet-eva,Not as bad as it sounds from the trailer,6,26 April 2016,"In no way as much as an upside surprise as ""The Lego Movie"", ""Daddy's Home"" plays much better than the trailer or lame title would lead you to believe. Mostly, this resulted form the trailer featuring Will Ferrell's character in a scene where he violently strikes a cheerleader with a basketball which is a decidedly unfunny thing to do (apparently the writers felt that if hitting a mascot with a ball is funny - ""Major League"" - then hitting anyone on a playing field but not directly playing the game is also funny). Around the slapstick comedy most of which lands with a similar thud to the basketball scene lies an interesting discussion of the place of modern American males in today's blended families. It examines instinctual jockeying for pecking order and how this now plays out through sensitivity and care towards offspring - a major change from 100,000 years of preceding human development. Once they put the Three Stooges mugging and slapping aside we come to identify with Farell and Walberg's characters and their struggles to find themselves in a changed society. In short, think of it like a salad containing ingredients you don't like - just watch around the stupid parts.",Daddy's Home

This is an unbelievable comedy movie that has so many funny moments you wouldn't know where to even start, such an incredible watch that I would watch again and again happily.Mark Wahlberg never fails to impress me with his comedic & seriousness its such a great combo. Will Ferrell is equally as funny if not funnier, I dont think I've ever seena scene where Ferlrell doesn't leave me in stitches, the chemistry between this two is crazy, first saw them in 'The Other Guys' another amazing masterpiece.Highly recommend this movie!",Daddy's Home
67,EthanBJones_03,Solid Comedy; worth a watch,8,15 January 2017,"Overall: This movie serves its main purpose - It's funny. Everyone who I watched this with was crying from laughter in this movie. I would watch it; it is entertaining enough.Good: All the characters are fun and interesting and the premise is quite cool. It is hysterically funny with lots of jokes due to the drastically contrasting character.Pretty much everyone does a good job acting wise with the two standouts being obviously Will Ferrell and Mark Walhberg. The two kids also do fantastic jobs considering their young age which is to be applauded. The story is okay but the ending more than makes up for it with a heart-warming, full circle end. The cinematography was reasonable and can't be faulted much.Bad: ​The actual story itself was pretty mediocre and was just a scramble of scripted events of them trying to beat each other without any rhythm or structure to them until the end. Linda Carledini's acting was sub-par and just felt lazy and like she wanted a pay check. The ending felt, while clever and funny, like sequel bait which, while I'd love to see, is something I hate in a movie that isn't pre- established as a series and has a satisfying ending.Best Part: 'James and the Giant Peach'MVP: Will Ferrell as Brad8/10",Daddy's Home

69,Ramascreen,Very funny!,9,23 December 2015,"DADDY'S HOME was such a pleasant surprise to me, I was just expecting your usual Will Ferrell type comedy where he'd be yelling and screaming on and on and on and we the audience are supposed to just take it and find it hysterical somehow, but nope, DADDY'S HOME is actually funny from start to finish! I couldn't stop laughing.Co-written and directed by Sean Anders, Will Ferrell plays a mild mannered executive at a Jazz radio station. His character, Brad Whitaker, is a husband material, financially stable, responsible, but a bit too by the book. He's married to Sara (Linda Cardellini) who has two kids from previous marriage to Dusty Mayron (Mark Wahlberg). Now, Dusty is everything Brad is not, he's Brad's complete opposite, a renegade, cool, he's got that bad boy look and not to mention super-buffed as hell, let's just say that ladies get their panties wet at the first sight of Dusty. Ever since he could remember, Brad has always wanted to be a dad and it's tough being a step-dad because the kids would often pull that old fashioned ""you're not my dad"" card, but Brad plows through, he believes in his book methods, and he finally connects with them, seems like a happy ending, until Dusty comes back into the kids' picture. He's the cool dad by a long shot, and ya know how it is, cool beats ordinary every time, or does it? That's when this dad vs. step dad begins. It takes him a while but Brad finally learns of Dusty's sabotage, and the battle is on.Here are some of the reasons why I think this movie works comedically, as I said earlier it's finally a movie where Will Ferrell doesn't just yell and scream loudly for long periods of time for no reason. Next to ""Anchorman,"" DADDY'S HOME is a movie that actually showcases Will Ferrell for the funnyman he really is. Another point is that Dusty's sabotage is done in this very clever way that even in Dusty's or Brad's most ridiculous attempts, you'll find yourself rooting for both because you see the good qualities that each one has despite Brad's dorkiness and Dusty's insecurity. The comedy serves the characters, not the other way around, that's ultimately what makes DADDY'S HOME effective. And ladies, if you've been a fan of Mark Wahlberg's all your life, baby you're about to love him more, if there's ever a movie that really accentuates Marky Mark in all his glory, DADDY'S HOME is it. The man even gets to practically work out half-naked in front of you! DADDY'S HOME is slapstick physical type family comedy but it also shows how difficult it is for parents to win the affection of their kids at times. Families come in different shapes, sizes, and forms these days, but you can make it work. Equally hilarious scene-stealing supporting performances by Thomas Haden Church and Bobby Cannavale, DADDY'S HOME is funny and heartwarming.",Daddy's Home

And this is the first film with Mark W that I have seen ( or maybe I did saw some a very very long time ago) and must say he was good ( I remember him more from the 90's and his music phase).Although many scenes are kinda cliché and have been in so many films, I admit that in this one they seem more cute and more interesting ( game scene - drawing of a family scenes - my kid has problems with other school kids - new/old man trying to win over his new/old love etc) ...The soundtrack could have been better. And they should have put some more recent songs. Though, the entrance of the daddy at the airport matches good with the song!All in all, quite a good film.

72,Figgy66-915-598470,Disappointing,5,3 January 2016,3January 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester This Afternoon - Daddy's Home. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg star in this comedy about the competition between a biological father and a stepfather who are vying for their children's affections. There were many humorous moments throughout the film but they were fleeting and both of the main characters appeared to be trying too hard. For two such established actors this vehicle was uncomfortable to watch. Both seem to be out of their comfort zones and I'll at ease with their roles in this film. The children were cute and the story rolled along smooth enough but as with most purpose written comedies these days you tend to see all the best bits in the trailers. Not my favourite film of the year so far....but I've only seen two!!!!!,Daddy's Home
73,ginocox-206-336968,Wahlberg carries the movie,5,17 March 2016,"""Daddy's Home"" is uneven. Certain aspects are brilliant and quite funny, while other aspects somehow manage to be simultaneously grating and tedious. I loved Dusty's relentless passive-aggressive manipulation and Machiavellian schemes, the moppets' undisguised hostility and some of the supporting characters, particularly Griff, Leo and Dr Francisco. There's a clever reversal of fortunes at the midpoint and another in the denouement. However, the movie also has a few issues. At various points other characters tell Brad to his face how much they dislike him. It's difficult to understand why anybody in the movie or the audience would like Brad, who is weak, sniveling, obsequious to a fault, insecure – the usual character faults that Ferrell's characters exhibit, but even more exaggerated. Yet, he has a beautiful wife who is 100% devoted to him. One can understand why she would be drawn to somebody who is the opposite of her first husband, but not why she is drawn to Brad, particularly when her children despise him so thoroughly. One would have expected her to condition marriage on his first gaining their confidence. Brad is apparently sterile, but not impotent, which interferes with their mutual desire to have another child. He overcompensates by throwing himself into all manner of parental activities, from chauffeuring the children to packing lunches with dreaded inspirational notes. As in many comedies and rom-coms, it isn't clear what Brad does for a living. He earns a comfortable salary working for company that provides branding and content to local radio stations, but the only thing we see him do is audition talent and he doesn't seem to be very good at it. Dusty is some sort of Renaissance man who is extraordinarily capable in all areas of human endeavor and glibly deceives everybody as to his capabilities in other areas. He makes friends quickly and has an incredible network of influential friends, all of whom owe him favors, much like Jack Nicholson's character in ""Anger Management."" The character is interesting, well acted and fun to watch, but like Brad, his success seems too easy. He completes a complex construction project under the radar in less than a day. Both characters seem to have too much money. We're not quite certain what Dusty wants to accomplish, whether he simply wants to drive Brad away or if he sincerely wants to reunite with Sara and his children. The film is basically a bromance between Brad and Dusty. Both characters are exaggerated and raise their initial rivalries to absurd levels without any difficulty. Meanwhile Sara (Cardellini) displays the patience of a saint as Brad and Dusty compete to see who can spoil the children more extravagantly and her life is thrown into turmoil by unwelcome house guests, vacillations of allegiances, life-changing events, betrayals of trust and significant destruction of property.I've never been much of a Will Ferrell fan, considering his comedy best enjoyed in small doses. He was brilliant in ""The Producers,"" amusing in ""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery"" and enjoyable in ""The Other Guys."" Here, his brand of comedy becomes a bit monotonous and grating. Wahlberg carries the film. Although his talents seem superhuman, he is much more grounded. He plays the straight man with deft timing, sings, dances and tells bedtime stories in a baroque voice. He's the type of antagonist you love to hate. He manages to be convincingly duplicitous, particularly when expressing sympathy over Brad's misfortunes. Technical aspects are adequate, although there is a jarring shift in POV near the end. The entire film is told from a first-person perspective. Every shot is either Brad or Brad's POV, until the end when Dusty has a voice-over. The Ford product placements were a little heavy-handed, with endorsements written into the dialogue. One gag concerning a feminine hygiene product seems incomplete. A quick search revealed various alternate uses for the product, but none really seemed to explain why it was left where it was. Camera movement was noticeable in some shots, but not distracting. Overall, the good parts are pretty good, but the bad parts are pretty bad. I had to pause playback about five times because it was just too annoying to endure in one sitting. But the movie had enough jokes and interesting performances that I eventually returned to it. The final scenes are a bit formulaic, but well executed with an interesting twist and a strong performance.",Daddy's Home
74,luke-a-mcgowan,"Don't come for laughs, cos there aren't enough",4,21 April 2016,"1. Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell have terrific chemistry. The two of them on screen is a delight to the senses. Wahlberg was born to play a character named Dusty who walks around with a shirt off. 2. Thomas Haden Church is really funny but his character serves next to no purpose in the entirety of the film. Outside the main two, Linda Cardenelli does a fairly good job herself.3. There's a lot of good writing in here and very subtle and believable maneuvering on the part of Wahlberg's character. Unfortunately, there's also a lot of silliness, especially when Ferrell splurges on a huge mid-year Christmas. Ponies and skate ramps get dropped in for stupid plot point reasons and then vanish once they aren't needed.4. The worst of all of them is Hannibal Buress' Griff, the target of a moderately funny joke that then overstays its welcome for the entire run time of Daddy's Home. They recycle it roughly six times, all while ignoring the obvious intrusiveness of the character. Viewers are required to suspend their belief completely as Brad (and more importantly, Sara) continue to tolerate Griff's presence in their home. No one is THAT afraid of being called a racist. 5. The movie won props for me when Sara toughened up and kicked both men out of her life (plus Griff). Her joy at the potential of a third child was a pure display of jubilation and genuinely brought a smile to my face. Then the film kicked her in the teeth and demeaned her in the film's final act.6. I didn't laugh nearly as much as I wanted to. There were two laugh out loud moments but the rest was fairly standard. It didn't help that most of the best jokes were in the trailer.7. The best way to make someone's stunt double obvious is to have a black stunt double for Will Ferrell. 8. The film's climax is terrible, with an excruciatingly obvious, preachy and cliché resolution. Not even watching Marky Mark bust a move is worth the cringe I suffered.9. Okay seriously, they actually name the baby after Griff. Seriously. 10. That John Cena cameo though.",Daddy's Home
75,srdjan_veljkovic,"It has quite a few good moments, but they don't compose well",5,17 January 2016,"The problem here is that, for such a fundamental theme, fatherhood, the movie depends on gags. Some of the gags are good, but, they stand isolated, not forming a compelling whole.Thomas Hayden Church, for example, is completely wasted in this way. His gags are not that good and he doesn't contribute much to the movie, except being a well known and liked actor.There were many opportunities to get more in touch with emotions and be closer to all the dads out there. It isn't enough to put Linda Cardellini as the mom to make you wish you were in Will Ferrell's place and wonder what you'd do. BTW, Linda Cardellini's reaction to seeing Allesandra Ambrosio as her ex husband's new wife is one of the finest points in the movie.The story also has some strange dynamics, cuts pretty abruptly and while the ending is actually OK (unlike many modern movies), it is disjoint from the rest of the movie, much like most other parts / gags are.",Daddy's Home

It actually does pretty well for a while, managing to entertain us with its amusing moments and pleasing humour. However, it quickly descends into a slothful and unfair comedy in which we were obviously fooled by the enthusiasm of the trailer.Comedies obviously provide as much laughs as they can during trailers to attract audiences to the film. That's how it works, right? Well Daddy's Home excites us before bringing us to the fact that it's simply just a few funny situations before shaping into a big load of clichéd dad material. But it also suddenly bombards us with extremely uneven gender stereotypes and plain toxicity.Thankfully, once all of that garbage is settled to the side, it's a bright blue sky! Before becoming clichéd, the moments where the bright and shiny stars, Ferrell and Wahlberg, get competitive in increasing adoration from their children are very fun and thoughtful. There's obviously humour as well, but it's just to the point of becoming predictable.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Daddy's Home
77,patriciogl10,Actually surprised.,7,29 November 2019,"Let's face it, nowadays it's a major surprise when a comedy actualy makes you laugh and for me, Daddy's Home shockingly did that, and I mean shockingly because I had no expectations at all. Previous Ferrell and Wahlberg pairing didn't prove effective last time I checked, mainly the reason I was unsure about this film. The plot certainly serves as a seemingly expected recipe for comedy, even though most comedies are horrible at executing properly plots that on page appear to be funny. Rivalries between two opposites most of the time deliver, and this is no exception.
Both Ferrell and Wahlberg play their parts correctly, each providing their own funny input to a hilarious cocktail that is their chemistry together, something I feared it wouldn't turn out so well.Daddy's Home proves you can still make comedies with a small but effective plot and an adequate execution with two great leads, forging its weight on the efficiency of the pairing.

78,FelipeCarrillo,"""Hi, Memorable Comedy? No.""",6,23 January 2016,"""Ferrell: Good Daddy - Wahlberg: Bad Daddy"" Who won the battle of this indecisive comedy? The first mistake of this film is seen with the naked eye, Why Daddy's Home? ¡Mediocre!. It would have been much better with ""Daddy's War"" adapting more to the plot of the film between a dad exemplary and a daddy not exemplary. The participation of Ferrell in this shaky project (years ago, in something similar, interpreted by Julia Roberts and Susan Sarandon) is without a doubt unstable. This man is in charge of doing good and deep comedies and Mark on the other hand, it is responsible to make comedies empty but the blockbuster (Ted - Ted 2). What comes out of this mixture? Visually, Ferrell is influenced by the attitude of its imposing and rockstar co - star. Perhaps, the paternity's issue is adopted quite well the two stars, Dusty wanting to have more to his wife that his own children, tries it with bribes and telling fantastic stories and Brad being a good stepfather trying to overcome his enemy. Linda Cardellini joins to Ferrell with her performance totally abstract, Interpreting a hopeful mother in pregnancy and executing the function of balance, she has to be balanced in part and part. The ""Other Guys"" duo are reattached to give us something that can be called ""Comedy"". At the present time, the subject of divorce is easy in fury, and ""Daddy's Home"" takes advantage of these situations. Undoubtedly, the part more exciting in a film in which two men fight for their children is the 'fight'. It's very striking is the 'VS' in this movie. War events are fun and hilarious and often it is the best of all the run - time. Really aimed a few aspects, little we can squint. it is tortuous but at the same time enjoyable and even a bit heartwarming. So the film is fun until the moment that it becomes irritating. 'DH' promised much and it looked very interesting leading our excitement to the top of the thermometer, after 96 minutes, out of the film room feels like a bucket of water cold, all our excitement disappears and makes us think: ""Whoa!!

Finally a funny movie again, with a charming cast (besides Wahlberg and Ferrell Linda Cardellini, the always great Thomas Hayden Church and the cute Scarlett Estevez (shining also in the terrific show Lucifer), a nice story with a clear link to reality and therefore an even more amazing reconciliatory ending which solves the dilemma in a (plausible) way that none of the parties falls by the wayside.

The story is interesting and there have been some moments in the movie when it actually worked but there was no flow in there. The story was interrupted constantly by moments of stupid humour or poor choices in plot, not letting you get into it for more than five minutes. While it could have been a movie both serious but with some really nice laughs, it was not. Mark Walberg is not the star actor, but I mean, come on. Do you really need to be making these movies?

I am not saying every single joke was original, but it certainly fit the movie, and everything felt like in place. The acting is just so good, two of my favorite actors paired up and gave us one of the most well-written greatly comedic movies.It is so underrated, I don't think this deserves 6 at all, if anyone is being skeptical, it's these guys who's making tra-sh of this movie.

87,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 42,4,13 January 2016,"We all know Will Ferrell's comedy. It's irreverent, self-deprecating, and raunchy. But none of these belong in a film that wants to be sentimental. And it doesn't even reach the point of cloying until about 10 minutes left.This is nothing against Ferrell or Mark Wahlberg's comedic skills or their chemistry with one another. I just think the filmmakers got excited about all the talent on board that they forgot that they had to make an actual movie.In Daddy's Home, Ferrell plays Brad, the nebbish new husband of Sarah (Linda Cardellini), who tries to vie for the affection of his new stepchildren. Then, all of a sudden, Sarah's deadbeat ex-husband, Dusty (Wahlberg), comes to town to see his children. Dusty has no knowledge of Brad--an issue that never gets resolved--and does everything in his power to bully him and make him feel inferior while trying to win Sarah and his kids back.The film has very few laughs, despite its talent, and feels obviously reliant on its credentialed leads. There is no real meat to the plot and never builds momentum. It just muddles along until about the last 15 minutes, when it actually attempts to go somewhere with its empty premise. It's literally an hour and a half of Dusty bullying Brad and everyone in the film laughing about it. It's relentless. And there's no back and forth either. All of the humility is on Ferrell's character.Brad can't have children because of radiation exposure to his genitals, so Dusty belittles him by convincing him that Sarah wants more children and that he won't be able to provide for her. But it turns out that Sarah is the one with no scrotum, as she does nothing to stop Dusty's harassment, and even sides with him a few times. What an appealing movie.We feel bad for Ferrell's character the whole time (or at least we should) that it makes none of this funny. But with Ferrell comes insensitivity. He almost begs us to be okay with him being put down. And although he provides almost all of the laughs in this film, it would have almost been better if he wasn't in it. Maybe then the writers would have been okay with giving the movie some real meaning.The biggest problem is that Ferrell doesn't fit in this type of role. He's at his true best when he's the one playing the douchey guy (Anchorman, Talladega Nights). Then his foibles are exposed and it's pure ironic genius. Personally, I don't like seeing him in these types of roles.I just couldn't help feeling the entire time that this was just a lazily put together product. In fact, at one point in the movie I believe the camera actually shakes as if it was bumped slightly.The only saving grace is Thomas Hayden Church's character. He plays Brad's coworker at the smooth jazz radio station. He provides us with a few off-kilter quips of insight which are better bottled up and served separately from the rest of the film.Unless you enjoy an entire movie where everyone worships the antagonist to the delight of the audience, you won't be pandered by this. The epicaricacy borders on sadistic. And when the redemption finally comes in the end, it doesn't make up for anything. The people who like this film must get their psyche fully evaluated.Twizard Rating: 42",Daddy's Home
88,hoxjennifer,"Funny, amusing, one-time comedy",6,31 December 2016,"Daddy's Home is not classic comedy, it's one of those one-time, watch on an airplane movie just to pass the time. Will Ferrell plays the stepfather who's always wanted to be a father, clearly a wimpy kid in his childhood that grew up to be a pushover adult that lives for other people. Dusty Mayron played by Mark Wahlberg, a tough guy, no strings attached kind of dad who is still living and reliving his adventure years instead of facing his own responsibilities. It has its moments, Will Ferrell has his typical outbursts and the stark contrast between the two father figures is enough amusement on its own. It has its corny moments (especially near the end, although I won't say what to avoid spoiling anything) that are almost cringe-worthy, but otherwise I would say it's quite an enjoyable film, although good for just the one-time watch only.",Daddy's Home
89,japamo,Batty Stepdad v Super Real Dad – The Dawn of Parental Justice,8,16 April 2016,"On Saturday, April 9, 2016, after stuffing ourselves with seafood at the Shaking Crab in Newton, MA, my friend Mark Sterling and I went to his home to watch a movie on his 70"" TV in his furnished basement. At first, we were trying to decide whether to see the Oscar- winning ""Spotlight"" or ""Bridge of Spies"". But, feeling that we had just gotten through a long, tiring, busy week (especially Mark, since he's a gastroenterologist at Tufts Medical Center), we were really in the mood for an outrageous, screwball, dumba$$ comedy. Therefore, we finally decided to rent Will Ferrell's ""Daddy's Home"" (hereafter ""DH""), since it seemed to fill the bill.Ferrell plays nice, domesticated, somewhat docile stepdad Brad Whitaker, basically happily married to loving, supportive Sara Whitaker (Linda Cardellini). The only downside (besides a case of impotency caused by an X-ray accident at the dentist) is that his stepchildren Megan (Scarlett Estevez) and Dylan (Owen Vaccaro) haven't quite warmed up to him yet. For example, at the beginning of ""DH"", we see a montage of Megan's drawings showing Brad not only separate from the rest of the family, but with poop on his head. Gamely trying to see the best in everything, Brad comments that in each picture he gets a little closer to the family. At his executive position at VERY light jazz playing radio station called The Panda (hee-hee), Brad's boss Leo Holt (Thomas Haden Church) tries to give him moral support but ends up whining in endless detail about his ex-wives.Things get more complicated and desperate when Megan and Dylan's real, biological father Dusty Mayron (Mark Wahlberg) suddenly comes back to visit his family. Almost completely, diametrically opposite to Brad, Dusty is a rough-edged, muscular, masculine biker guy. Although Sara is not thrilled that Dusty is trying to ease his way back into the family, the kids are overjoyed. Despite the competition, Brad allows Dusty to remain in the house so he can demonstrate to the kids that he is the better parent. Boy, did Brad ever underestimate how hard this was going to be!Not only is Dusty handsomer, more confident, and assertive than Brad, he's cooler, handier, and more fun. Brad tries to show than he can be too, but he just ends up literally running into walls and getting the shock of his life while trying to skateboard. He also inadvertently offends a repairman named Griff (Hannibal Buress) who had come to repair the hole in the bedroom wall Brad put there while driving a motorcycle. Even though Brad says that he can fix the hole himself (which set off Griff in the first place), Griff stays as an unwanted house guest and constantly criticizes Brad.The funny thing is, Dusty does not actively compete with Brad. He is content to lie back, make vaguely sarcastic remarks about Brad's parenting philosophy and his manhood, and let Brad make a pathetic wuss of himself. Brad even goes practically broke by dressing up like Santa Claus and buying a ton of toys for his stepkids and buying $18,000 basketball tickets for courtside seats for them and his wife. This infuriates Sara and causes her to toss both Brad and Dusty out of the house. The only hope for Brad (and Dusty) to make things right is a father-daughter dance.Make no mistake, ""DH"" is a crazy-dumb, out-of-its mind comedy. Nevertheless, it's a laugh riot because Will Ferrell is such a versatile comic treasure. He can handle sophisticated, rational verbal comedy, as when he's trying to explain his touchy-feely, New Age-y approach to child psychology, rearing, and discipline (e.g. use dancing instead of fighting to solve disputes). But Ferrell is also not afraid to launch into profane, crude tirades and meltdowns when things don't go his way (e.g. using his chance to sink a basket and win a Disney vacation to instead tear into Dusty and his sneaky attempts to take over the family). Finally, Ferrell fearlessly tackles physical comedy, too, even willing to dive into slapstick and personal embarrassment scenes to get his family back (e.g., besides the motorcycle/skateboard accidents, we have Farrell half-naked at a fertility clinic run by Dr. Emilio Francisco (Bobby Cannavale) and dancing shirtless at the father-daughter dance, and the ""classic"" basketball court scene, which made Mark and me howl).Ferrell goes to the limit in ""DH"" and yet is such a fundamentally decent guy that, even as you're laughing your guts out, you're urging Brad to get his s#!t together and get his family back. Does he? Well, ""DH"" does prove convincingly that while any idiot can have a child, it takes a very special person to be a parent – and to drive within the cones.P.S.: WWE wrestling superstar John Cena appears in ""DH"". He makes even the chiseled, buff Wahlberg look like the 90-pound weakling who gets sand kicked in his face at the beach.",Daddy's Home

91,TheGreatMarkukini,There is always a bigger fish in the sea,4,8 July 2019,"Not the first time I see the Mark Wahlberg and Will Ferrell duo; and as always it's a macho & wimp cocktail stirred but not shaken. The same I can say about myself after watching the dad rivalry that stretches for good hour and a half, but why is that?Contrast is the key to attract attention to the picture, and we see it everywhere. Literally, each breath of Dusty by Mark Wahlberg is countered rickety by Brad (Will Ferrell), every cool trick slammed by a disastrous pirouette. Once or twice it's funny, but after the plot becomes as predictable as obesity after McDonalds.Nevertheless, I think that out all of the mess we can dig a bunch of witty and cracking jokes from fit and cool Mark. He never fails to deliver unexpected refreshing breeze amidst the stale stink of rotten vegetables. Honestly, more than a half of the jokes are even lower than a toilet humor and force a desire to scroll further to the end.Still wondering what did I just see, I would say that there are a few good moments that make you appreciate being yourself but overall for me it's a total disposable comedy that passes in your memory as NASCAR racers by the vigilant fans - blink and you'll miss it.

This film isn't something you should race out to see, but hey if you can watch it for cheap or have nothing else to do then hey why not.The film is fun and entertaining to see on screen, and it knows what it really is and embraces itself for that.

93,tjgoalie13,"A Somewhat Funny, Albeit Clichéd Comedy",5,12 January 2016,"Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg have good comedic chemistry, if you need real proof look no further than The Other Guys, this isn't quite as funny. If you're hoping for something like The Other Guys, these two films share a few similarities but are ultimately very different films. Daddy's Home has its stretches of good humor, but ultimately drags on, and offers nothing really new to the comedy genre. It should be clarified that the film has a good amount of humor, so if that's the main concern Daddy's Home should deliver.The comedic premise of this film is exactly the same as The Other Guys, in that Will Ferrell plays a bland man while Mark Wahlberg brings some chaos into his life. The film is fairly funny and proves that there's still water in that well, for the moment. The film has a fun tone, that's infectious, even the most serious people could find themselves smiling during stretches of the film. However, these stretches are too inconsistent.The film is only an hour and a half but feels more like a two-hour film. While many of the film's gags work, many other gags feel like long stretches of awkwardness, that just drag on. To further that, while the film is funny, it's never hilarious, or belly-aching funny. The film ultimately leaves a feeling of emptiness, because it tries to be funny, but ultimately fails for stretches, and drags on.Maybe the worst thing the film does is what it doesn't do, which is offer any original concepts to the comedy genre. When you get so many talented people working together and you get jokes that are rehashes from previous films they did or rip-offs of Bridesmaids jokes, it's disappointing. The film is dumb, in the sense of logic within the story, but also in terms of effort, as a film that only rehashes old jokes is just lazy. It seems unfortunate that the filmmakers couldn't make a denser story to fill the framework of the film.In the end, if you're looking for a comedy that has a good amount of laughs in it, that you can watch with the family, Daddy's Home will get the job done. However, if you're searching for the next great comedy, that offers new ideas to the somewhat clichéd comedy genre, this isn't it. In the end, Daddy's Home is somewhat funny, features good chemistry from it's two leads, and has some decent character development, but fails on the originality test.",Daddy's Home

Well their is a competition between the dad's for the love of the kids and mom and what you saw on the trailer was the full extent of the jokes. what I found the most annoying was the will Ferrell performance I find him silly and very idiotic and I swear he has phoned in the same performance for the last ten years and I am tired of his historonics and schtick . I noticed people ripping adam sandler about his performances well Ferrell should be lambasted too. this movie was just tired yet I enjoyed it better than the new star wars so that should be an accomplishment.,Daddy's Home
95,nmholland,One of the Better Comedies of 2015,7,28 January 2016,"Daddy's Home is directed by Sean Anders and is the story about a man (Will Ferrell) that is newly married to a woman (Linda Cardellini) that has two kids from a previous marriage. Ferrell doesn't feel too accepted by her children, but when her ex husband (Mark Wahlberg) is invited over by Ferrell, it becomes a battle of the dads. This movie was released on Christmas Day of 2015, and I saw it on the 26th. This movie definitely was one of the better comedies of the year, but that's not saying too much.I personally like Mark Wahlberg, and I don't mind Will Ferrell either. I like Wahlberg in Lone Survivor, Shooter, and others, and I liked Ferrell in Elf, and the Anchorman movies. They also have really good on-screen chemistry together as actors. However, some of the jokes in this movie were just dry and bland. Really, I'd heard a lot of the same stuff before in Ferrell movies, so it didn't sound too original. I kind of feel like the screenplay writers for his movies just make him say the same stuff, just because it's funny. One of the biggest rules of comedy is: if it's said more than once, it's not funny. And Ferrell doesn't seem to follow that rule.However, despite the above paragraph, Daddy's Home had some genuine comedy and laughs in it. I laughed multiple times just in the first 15 minutes or so. I laughed especially in a scene towards the middle of the movie in which multiple ""package"" comparisons are made between Ferrell's character and Wahlberg's. It had me laughing a few time, just in one scene, and that's pretty impressive. Linda Cardellini was a highlight in this film as well. Some people may know her as Laura Barton, Hawkeye's wife, from Age of Ultron, where she also delivered a good performance. I somewhat hope she has a bright career ahead of her, because I would like to see more from her in the future.The last point I'd like to make is the children actors in the movie. For children, they honestly do really good. Not the best child acting, but you really can't expect too much from children when it comes to being a big character in a Hollywood flick. They will most likely be doing another project in the near future, due to their good abilities.Overall, Daddy's Home did feature some dim comedy, but was ultimately pretty funny. I think Daddy's Home deserves a B-, or a 7 out of 10 stars.",Daddy's Home

97,dissident320,90 minutes of seeing someone getting kicked in the groin,3,1 July 2017,"I think I'll put as much thought into this review as the writers did for this movie. Will Ferrell is the dorky step-dad. Really nice but uh oh the kids don't like him. Girl kid says random mean things and has advanced vocabulary for her age and is articulate when convenient. Starting to connect with boy kid but not quite there! Uh oh their real dad is coming home. He is super cool Mark Wahlberg! His hair is slicked back. Can you guess what he drives? A motorcycle! Not a stupid Ford Flex (Hahaha cute self-aware product placement!). Will Ferrell is kind of a wet-blanket and Mark Wahlberg sweet talks himself into staying with the family. Who can tuck the kids in better? Marky Mark of course! He's so cool! Can Will Ferrell drive that motorbike? He can try! Ooops he drove through the house and got stuck in the wall. Don't worry Marky Mark has his shirt off and will punch you out. You're such a dork compared to him! Now they hired someone to fix the house but Marky Mark makes Will question his masculinity! Send him away! Uh oh he's black! Now you feel racist and it's Hannibal Buress so obviously he will call you out on it, silly! Don't you feel dumb! Don't worry, cue the montage of you being a cool dad helping the kids in sports and after school activities. The audience can see you're the unsung hero cool dad Will! Oh no, you cam home and Marky Mark built a tree-house and a half-pipe with Hannibal! Now he's living at your place now too! He's so kooky as well, always commenting on family issues when he shouldn't! Oh Hannibal, you big goofball! Will is now going to prove he can skateboard and be cool! He probably won't hurt himself. Oh he died. Yes he literally dies and Marky Mark brings him back in a ""hilarious' sequence where he tells all the kids to stay calm before calling 9- 11. This movie is so fun and unpredictable. How will it end? Read on! Earlier we find out for no reason Will is sterile but it wasn't for no reason because Marky Mark says she does want a kid! Now they go to the clinic and the doctor thinks Marky Mark is the best, his penis is huge and he has the record for the most sperm and his balls are perfect. Will has weird balls and then he goes to jack it and the curtains fall down and a whole office birthday party sees his sad presumably small dinky. Oh you can't catch a break! Blah blah blah he has early Christmas and tries to make himself look better to the kids. He gets Lakers tickets for the family but Marky Mark comes too and then he knows the Lakers trainer (Of course) and then they get court-side seats without Will. He mad and randomly yells at the kids and mom gets mad. I almost forgot there's a mom because her character barely has any purpose other than decide on which wonderful man to fight for. I think she has a job because at one point she was wearing heels but who can be sure. Those type of things would just get in the way of the comedy! Who's Bechdel and why are they giving me tests? Anyways, Will gets drunk at the NBA game but he wins the half-court throw because why not. Oh hey Paul Scheer, you're in a movie that you would probably mock on your podcast. Will so drunky he throws the ball at a cheerleader's face. Ooops!!! He wants another throw. He hits a child in a wheelchair?!! He can't catch a break at all! This goofy movie! And he is kicked out of the house. We're almost done, I think. Marky Mark is gonna be super awesome dad and win his wife back because she is a prize to be won, okay. Oh no he gets annoyed about waiting in line with his new car, to pick up the kids. He drives off!!! Now Will is with Thomas Hayden Church who has Colonel Saunders facial hair because why not. He's probably the funniest character in this garbage anyway so I'll give him a pass. Now Hannibal shows up to tell Will that Marky is skipping town. What next? Will goes and gets Marky Mark and they go to the daughter's dance thing or whatever together. On his motorbike together because funnier, okay? Now the bully thing with his son gets tied up here that I forgot to mention earlier because it's dumb and just adds to Will being a doormat and loser character because it's just the way to do comedy! Looks like the bully is a girl! Twist! And the dad is Bill Burr. Is Marky Mark gonna fight him? Almost! Will suggests dance off instead! Let's undercut everything and just have a dance off! This is superb! Hilarious! Does the wife take him back? Do you have any doubt? Course she does. Now Marky Mark has a literal castle next door because he got so rich because of his job as the jazz radio voice at the station that Will worked at that I forgot to mention earlier because it was also stupid, I mean clever and there's so many clever things packed in here that I miss some. Well the jazz station makes a lot of money because reasons and they can pay him millions and millions it's a great gag don't worry about it. And he has a Ford Flex, Will was right it's great.

What is this happening throughout in the movie and the second husband Will Farrell is being humiliated altogether. What is shown might be a custom or tradition in US families; well it's not a custom in other societies that after the second marriage the ex-husband is that much welcomed in the house as in this movie.

105,mirkobozic,Too predictable.,3,20 January 2016,"Will Ferell's never really been my cup of tea comedian-wise, save for Zoolander. Here, he plays Brad, a step-dad who's all about his kids accepting him as a real father, until their biological dad Dusty(Mark Wahlberg) waltzes right into the picture on his bike and a biker outfit. Dusty's been missing for years out of that picture and is making Brad miserable by playing the good cop who treats his offspring as pals instead as children, embarrassing Brad in the process over and over again up to the point where his opponent ends up clinically dead due to a skating accident. Will Farell's character is a wuss and though we're supposed to root for him, you just want to push the guy in the face for his stepford dad thing. On the flip side of the coin, we have Mark Wahlberg who manages to win you over in spite of his behavior, and that's probably not what the director was going for. As he grows into a responsible adult towards the end of the film, Ferrell just stands there as a crybaby. If it were for me, both of them would have had left and never returned in the end, but this is a Hollywood film, so a bad finale isn't really an option, and it's all too predictable from the very moment when Wahlberg shows up.",Daddy's Home

108,rebeccalucy,Just okay...,4,17 December 2017,"Has some decent comedy but sometimes becomes too silly or cruel in its manner. Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg can be quite good actors, but the performances are quite basic. I like the way Farrell's character really wants children, which is unconventional. Lina Cardellini's character is kept to the sidelines and has little development throughout the film. She often becomes a plot hole by letting Whalberg's character get away with far too much! Furthermore, some of the comedy can be funny. Like some of the back and forth between the fathers can be entertaining. However, some jokes really fall flat and needed a lot more work. Certain scenes like the basketball scene are far too cruel, we are supposed to root for the main dad but this scene makes it incredibly hard to feel anything for him. The cinematography is very dull and uninspiring, it could of added to comedic scenes if used effectively. There is a quiet a funny cameo near the end, which was a little unexpected. Overall a few decent laughs but better comedies are out there.",Daddy's Home

Critics, stop pushing this into the ground!!!!!!",10,26 December 2015,"I saw Daddy's Home in a packed theater at an afternoon screening and I personally think this movie's very funny in a lot of places. I found myself laughing out loud throughout the entire movie, and the rest of the audience agrees with me. There were times where the people in the theater were laughing so loudly and heartily that the next lines of dialogue were nearly inaudible! Everyone loved it so much, they clapped their hands at the end of the film, so critics, know what a great comedy is. The characters Griff and the boss played by Thomas Haden Church were particularly hysterical. The movie also has a few heartwarming moments to add to a really funny script. The trailers and TV ads didn't show all of the belly laughs for a change!! Great soundtrack to add to that. Daddy's Home is a hilarious gem and it's definitely worth going to watch in the theater!!!! Don't believe the critics that gave this a negative review who just select little nitpicks and enlarge them to an extent so that they can get a paycheck- go watch this!!",Daddy's Home

He just says ""I love my family, and I love..."" and he goes on about his car.Yep.That was about a minute or two in.The movie is somehow worse as it goes on. Multiple times they make unfunny, bland, racist jokes that serve nothing to the plot and are just insulting. Many times over I just sighed and buried my face in my palm.

No filler, Very well paced and never a dull moment. Laughs were frequent and often throughout the entire running time. If you like the premise of the trailer and found it funny then the film totally delivers on it. The audience around me were laughing throughout too and it was a packed screening. I can't understand why the critics have given it such poor reviews, worse than the majority of the other comedies reviewed this year or before. Maybe they want you to go and see that boring below average Star Wars movie that's dominating film news and screens at multiplexes right now. If you want to be entertained, have fun and leave the cinema totally satisfied then i would thoroughly recommend Daddy's Home over the blandbuster Star Wars The Force Awakens anyday.If you thought The Other Guys was funny then you will not be disappointed with Daddy's Home...you may even laugh more in this one. And its way more funnier and pacier than Get Hard.For an example of my taste: The stand out comedies of this year that i laughed a lot in were... SPY. The Wedding Ringer. Vacation.

117,saymaraza,Daddy's home review,9,27 March 2016,"One of the funniest films I have ever seen! Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg team up as dads who hate each other. I think Mark Wahlberg really shone in this movie, as the cool, and sexy dad who had just got out of prison. While Will Ferrell plays his same old character of the guy who always gets pushed around by the male dominant, which in this case is Wahlberg. Will Ferrell always plays these roles, but he does play them perfectly in my opinion. This follow up from Wahlberg and Ferrels previous film 'the other guys' was some what just as funny if not better. Director Adam McKay probably would have done this film if he was not busy with the financial Crisis film 'the big short' I thought this film was epic. I can't remember the last time I laughed so much in the cinema. If you haven't seen this, and you like that silly sort of comedy, then this might just be the movie for you.",Daddy's Home

120,brendandevere,Ferrell versus Wahlberg!,8,27 December 2015,"Everybody loves a good laugh, but what makes us burst out into shrieks of delight is purely in the eye of the beholder. Some people still find Adam Sandler funny (and relevant)while others find the rebooted canned laughter of early eighties slapstick comedy the right fit for their sense of humour. It is all about taste and what one actually finds amusing. I find Will Ferrell amusing and when he teams up with Marky Mark Wahlberg, then what you have are a couple of ""goofs"" that can actually make people laugh. They are opposite in every way and because of this extreme difference, their personalities just seem to gel.Director, Sean Anders (We're the Miller's) has reunited Ferrell and Wahlberg for the first time since their maiden outing together in the goofed up comedy, 'The Other Guys'. Surprisingly, that film worked with a collection of the most bizarre casting coming together to produce a funny cinematic experience. 'Daddy's Home has created a similar feeling with plenty of riotous events that will leave you with no other choice but to laugh out loud before choking on a mouthful of popcorn. Brian Burns screenplay is nothing spectacular but it doesn't have to be as Ferrell revels in the moment, delivering his trademark idiosyncratic 'fruitcake' performance. The funny man is constantly on the receiving end of Wahlberg's macho act but it sets the tone for some memorable events. Ferrell's films are predictable but he does them so well that the fans keep coming back for more. Marky Mark is proving versatile and isn't afraid of fabricating his own style. He is comfortable in allowing Ferrell to take the lead and then with all the smoothness of a newborn babies bum, slides into his role, bouncing off the comedic turn of big Willy's antics.As the title refers, 'Daddy's Home' is primarily about fatherhood. Ferrell is the Step-dad, Brad Whitaker, who has longed to be a dad but because of an unfortunate incident, can no longer father his own. He gets his opportunity when he marries Sara (Linda Cardellini), a sheer beauty who has two children from a previous relationship. Ferrell's dopey, almost juvenile approach to his two step-children fuels the laughs from the very beginning. He is a man that loves his role and even in the face of adversity he enthusiastically launches himself into the children's lives. Brad's world is threatened when the irresponsible biological father makes a visit. Dusty Mayron (Mark Wahlberg) is everything Brad is not. In a simple word, the man is cool. He is popular with everybody and can do pretty much anything.What follows is a riotous narrative of Step-dad versus dad as both Brad and Dusty go to great lengths to out do each other for the admiration of their children. There are some truly gut busting moments and throw in the dry humour of Thomas Haden Church as Leo Holt, adds flavour to an already delicious pie. A real standout are the well timed comments of Hannibal Buress whose presence is hard to ignore. His character, Griff, is likable from the very first appearance. Griff's relationship with both Brad and Dusty are priceless and commands the audiences attention whenever he is on the screen.'Daddy's Home' does exactly what it was supposed to do and that was to make people laugh. Director, Sean Anders has delivered a thoroughly amusing film that allows its cast (especially Ferrell) to do their stuff. Relax and enjoy it. You will be rewarded.",Daddy's Home

It doesn't make sense. In a cartoon like fred flintstone, it's clearly indicated that it's a cartoon and they make all sorts of unrealistic things like using dinosaurs as appliances, or talking to aliens. But this movie just has these moments where you think ''please stop insulting my intelligence''. This movie might be entertaining for an 8 year old, but I think it poisons their mind. It tries to make people think how ''the stay at home dad is a beta male loser who has no backbone, and the alpha male is the cool dude!''. No, the alpha male is the one who raped your mother and hits you, is unemployed and causes you trauma. The ''bad boy'' is not the ''cool father''. And no 40 year old is a beta male loser with no backbone.Apart from that, it just doesn't make sense why they let that bad boy loser in the house.

High functioning autism is autism.Will Ferrell plays the perfect half (step) parent not the man child this time but high functioning autistic all the same. Instead of a TV anchorman, Will plays a radio executive. Given he is neuro untypical, it is very challenging for him to compete with the brawn and coordination of his other half: the biological father played by Mark Walburg. Will this beginning un coordinated and co dependent dance between them turn into a slam dance? Autistic spectrum: Rigid thinking, strong resistance to change of routine, sensory processing differences (often a lack of fine motor skills) and a strong desire to fit in and be accepted.Because of a strong desire to be accepted as the stepfather, he invites the braun to stay in their home for two weeks. A nightmare for any step family.My first laugh came when this HFA step father took picture of the homework routine (special interests) . My second laugh came when it took him six months to put three boards together to build a treehouse. The motorcycle escapade was hilarious. Fine motor skills lacking.I could not stop laughing when the overripe glamour boy Tom Church from Sideways says to the biological father ""Wow...you flew for the 101st Airborne. I have a lot of respect for you. Will you come over to my house?"". Just like in Sideways Tom issetting up others (this time Will the step father) to get angry. On a positive note, I loved how this perfect HFA half parent was always on time, was their Sunday School teacher. Was that ever refreshing to see in a movie.

132,divingsofla,Stereotypes that don't change,6,21 January 2016,"This movie made me think of how as a society we love to talk about gender equality and closing the gap ,etc, etc. but what really happens is the gap is being closed ONLY in women's issues. But that is not equality. Equality would be if we cared about all issues, not just those affecting one gender.For example, why does 99% of movies involving divorced couples, are made under the premises that: 1) the father is a deadbeat; and/or 2) it is the father who has to leave the house and later beg to see their kids. I mean, if we are EQUAL, then why doesn't the mother move out? why do we overwhelmingly see custody of children given to the mother? what is being done to change that? I have heard about shared custody, but it seems to progress real slow.The second stereotype involving genders is that men can not defend themselves from physical attacks from women under any circumstances. In this movie, we see for example a girl that is much bigger than the little boy and on top of that, she attacks him, but of course no one reprimands the girl for doing that, but rather, they scorn the little kid when he fights back ... sure, it is a movie, sure,it is a comedy...but there is a reason why this scenes exist...movies reflect how society thinks. Watch movies or TV shows and see how women react when a guy tells them something offensive...immediately she slaps him or punches him and no one thinks that is wrong. In fact, it is sometimes portrayed as ""funny""..Why? because we have come to accept that female to male violence is OK. So if we want real equality, These paradigms should END",Daddy's Home

There were times when Dusty did not have to do anything and Brad sets himself up.

While the plot is very generic, the characters are surprisingly not. The child actors are not the best, but their innocence combined with hilariously unexpected lines worked well. The best parts of the movie, in my opinion, are at Will Ferrell's workplace, the Panda. This is a funny and care free comedy that you can just shut your brain off while watching.

It is not consistently a barrage of righteous humor. It is not a complex and thought provoking plot. But what it is, is dependable, and surprisingly entertaining. The theme is simple ; Step Dad (Ferrell) and Bio Dad (Wahlburg) alpha male it up against each other for the affections of their children. A simple enough concept that is just rinsed and repeated throughout the film to varying effect. It has the chemistry the two leads established in 'The Other Guys'in spades. Its not quite as crass, or funny, as 'Stepbrothers'. Its not quite as clever in its humor as 'Anchorman'. Instead its a mish mash of all three. A funny consistent easy movie that is simple to follow, inoffensive, and scores big laugh out loud moments two or three times. The two ""dads"" are ably supported by the other actors in the film : the fertility doctor, Ferrells boss & the handyman. But the film never challenges in its humor nor its plot. It is very predictable on all fronts. The only real question is why they are tussling over the opinions of those annoying spoilt kids in the first place. But definitely worth a watch.",Daddy's Home
138,istvandragos,A movie that would've worked better with a R rating,4,3 January 2016,"Will Ferrell and Mark Walhberg team up again for comedy with far less success than last time. If The Other Guys was witty, Daddy's Home is just depending on some sight gags which are few and far between. The movie has a promising premise, but that's all, it never bothers to exploit it to maximum, it never pushes the comedy far enough, having just a PG-13 rating. The movie relies too much on the chemistry between Ferrell and Walhberg, whom you would expect to have some pretty nasty conversations and also doing some pretty naughty stuffs to prove their masculinity and their leading role in the family, but those moments are never coming. We rather get some sight gags that were already given away in the trailers, there are left almost no surprises, except the last joke, which is probably the funniest one. Sometimes the movie tries to to be family friendly and we get a disneyish feel, which doesn't really suit the movie and also feels in contradiction with some other moments. The characters aren't the best either, some of them giving up to easy on their goals and all these give ups happening due to a few short scenes and you are left wondering, where has all that motivation gone. Some characters are there just for the sake of being there, especially Linda Cardellini's, Will Ferrell's fictional wife, who acts contradictory, because she's just an extension either to Walhberg or either to Ferrell, most of the times when she gets a few lines, because she's not talking very much in the movie, she's just extending what they were saying.The other supporting characters aren't something to brag about either, being there just to say funny stuff. In conclusion the movie is not really worth watching, it really depends on what are you searching for, if you want a comedy that doesn't foray into too much darkness and perversity, I'd say go for it, but if you want something edgier and wittier search for Ferrell's previous movies.",Daddy's Home

145,frode-le,Could have been an Adam Sandler movie,6,26 March 2016,"Given how much I loved ""The Other Guys"",I was pretty excited to see Ferrel and Wahlberg back together again. But it turns out that ""Daddy's Home"" is for the most part just a normal family friendly comedy. It lacks the edge and twisted humor you'll normally find in Will Ferrel movies.Since this is a spoiler free review I'm not going to say too much about the plot. Will Ferrel plays the role of ""Brad"", who is working his ass off trying to be the new dad for the two children in his new family. But suddenly one day their real dad, played by Wahlberg, shows up with a plan to win his family back. From there on out everything is pretty predictable. In fact, if you replaced Will Ferrel with Adam Sandler you might think to yourself ""have I seen this before?""If you're expecting a movie in the style of ""The Other Guys"", you will be disappointed.

If you think it is inappropriate for your child to be subjected to masturbation, men touching each other's testicles, and boys punching girls in the face then you need to skip this one. The script is completely ridiculous. A child must have been in charge of editing and continuity. In one scene Wahlberg wants to take his family back from Ferrell. In the next scene Wahlberg cannot keep his car within the cones when picking up his kids from school so he no longer wants to be their Daddy. Makes perfect sense....in a 4/10 movie.",Daddy's Home

It was also a great showcase for its two leads, bouncing off each other like they'd been doing this for years. It's therefore perhaps a little surprising that it's taken five years for the duo to team up again, though this time the roles require them to be each other's antagonists rather than cop-buddies.Ferrell is Brad, a well-meaning stepfather to his wife's children. He aspires to nothing more than having these kids look up to him as the father figure he's always dreamed of being. However, this becomes complicated by the sudden arrival of the kid's actual father Rusty (Wahlberg], thus beginning a battle of wits between the two for the affection of the kids.The concept itself is a good one and carries potential, even if the execution is about as formulaic as we've come to expect from this sort of comedy. Its central story arc of two rivals competing for something or someone, only to come to the realisation that they might have to work together to achieve a common goal is nothing we haven't seen a million times before. As such, the script never fully allows the two leads to reach their full potential, though there are some undoubtedly laugh-out-loud moments (Ferrell and a curtain-blind, we'll say no more).Director Sean Anders has had a sketchy record so far, with a directorial record that includes 2008's gloriously unfunny SEX DRIVE, 2012's seldom seen THAT'S MY BOY and 2014 inferior sequel HORRIBLE BOSSES 2. It's safe to say he does not carry the weight of expectation on his shoulders. It's because of this that Anders can feel somewhat reassured as DADDY'S HOME is his best film so far, and hopefully a sign that the filmmaker is on his way in the right direction, even if there is still a bit of a way to go.Ferrell, not always used to playing a character as mild-mannered as Brad, has to tone down the usual schtick, only allowing himself a few fleeting glances of that glint in his eye that suggests he's just had the most ridiculous yet awesome idea ever. Wahlberg continues to show he is a lot more restrained when approaching comedy. As Rusty, he channels his inner-douchebag to create a guy who is actually not really very nice at all, with few qualms about wrecking Brad's life if it means he can get what he wants. He's a difficult character to like, or at times even find funny. The inevitable conclusion dictates that there is some character development by the end that really doesn't feel very true to Rusty's character, only serving to highlight the unfocused nature of the script these guys are working from.In the supporting roles, Linda Cardellini brings a real sense of warmth to the role of Ferrell's wife and Wahlberg's ex that could easily have been a throwaway part in lesser hands. As Ferrell's boss, Thomas Haden Church fares less well; not really possessing the comic timing to land the jokes he's presented with. In fact, you can't help but wonder that his part may well have been written with a different actor in mind. Finally, Hannibal Buress milks a role that is essentially not a lot more than a running gag.DADDY'S OUT will no doubt appeal to those after a more cuddly comedy, and there are a few decent gags to be had here. However, in the end this just feels like a bit of a missed opportunity, let down by the restrictions of its family-friendly rating.",Daddy's Home

A lot of laughs. Will Ferrell and Mark Walberg are the perfect team. Will is the suck-up Harvey Milktoast step-dad and Mark is the hot-as-a-firecracker sperm donor who unexpectedly shows back up in the kids lives. I get so tired of critics who rate comedies as though they are dramas. Lighten up people. Sit back and have a little fun. This movie isn't perfect, but I'd watch it again.

Imagine a semi funny SNL skit, not one you'll remember and talk about later but one that may have invoked a smirk. Now stretch that skit into a movie, without adding any more of the funny and you have Daddy's Home. I can only surmise the decent score this has received is from plants from the movie company, at least trying to fool you and sucker you into going before you have a chance to hear just how painfully dreadful this movie is. Is is a spoiler if I tell you this movie is horrible? If anyone is hoping for something as funny as their movie The Other Guys which was bad but had some funny parts, forget it.

As I said I am not a comedy fan and if there are any comedies I do like I prefer the dark comedy or satirical and life like/observational comedy. I have never seen a Will Ferrel movie and had reservations. I do remember Mark Wahlberg ( and brother Donnie) from old days of pop music, so I didn't really expect much from him either.

And the movie didn't make a tiny little effort to make the story about that whole process even a bit interesting. Bottom line: the movie was full of stereotypes.

All the so called funny scenes are in the trailer but they look better in the trailer that when they happen in the movie. The first 'funny' scene starts at 50 minutes into the film. Then you have to wait another 10 minutes for another so called joke. There are perhaps 4 jokes like this in the entire movie. The dialogue has no humor. We wait hoping the dialogue will get funny or the film pace is going to kick in gear, but nothing happens. Not a family film either because of the language.

I laughed out loud once, and sniggered a few times. The script smacked of someone out of ideas, the acting came across as forced as a consequence, and the final result is a movie aimed at no more than a juvenile audience.

First, I have to say that the movie is funny throughout most parts of the movie, but it lacks the storyline it deserves. The movie really did have the potential to be a very good movie overall, but I feel like it focused too much on it to be funny to where the storyline couldn't reach its potential. The best part of the movie was definitely the first 30-40 minutes of it, it just had so many smart and funny jokes in my opinion. I would rate this movie overall a 6/10, because it was funny and the storyline was okay and heartwarming in the end. I would have rated it higher if the storyline was better.I would recommend this to friends, family, and complete strangers; and I would watch this again in a few years.

One of the most important qualities of a good movie is memorable moments. When you talk with friends about movies they will ask ""how was it?"" ""What was it about?"" ""What was the best part?"" Or in conversation you will talk about a certain part. In this movie NOTHING STOOD OUT! When asked about it i just say ""unless you are bored don't waste your time.""

They are wrong to do this because I do not believe either have ever been in such a well crafted political satire. This film is obviously a satire of the 2016 Republican nominations.The children represent the American people. Will Ferrel's character is clearly Jeb Bush. He's very low energy and an all around loser. No one really seems to like him, but he is your only choice for a father figure in the beginning. Then Mr. Wahlberg shows up. At first I thought he was Donald Trump, but as the film progresses it's obvious he is Ted Cruz. He's better than ol Jeb, but he's so used to running around in the Senate you wonder if he can really be your nominee/father. Then there's Hannibal Buress's character who is pretty much Ben Carson. He's very relaxed and seems pretty cool, but still not the best father figure due to his lack of experience and the possibility that he may fall asleep at any moment. Then just as the credits are about to roll, the man, the legend John Cena comes on the screen, and it all becomes clear. This is our father, our president in this clever metaphor. Donald J. Trump.

The movie brought to life an exaggerated version of the step-father versus actual father battle and was sub-par in doing so. With the random bringing in of Hannibal Burress, and I mean really random, the plot failed to really make you keep attention as to what is going on in the movie, especially the beginning where I remember countless times scrolling through Twitter.The comedy of the movie was typical Will Ferrell. Some controversial topics joked about, some inappropriate content, and some childish humor. All in all, not my favorite movie but the comedic value is iffy, depending on your type of humor. Most likely would not watch the movie again but would definitely watch the humor clips online.",Daddy's Home
188,saraaclarke,Dreadful film,1,31 December 2015,"The trailer contains the only funny scenes in this movie. The characters are totally unbelievable and the storyline is threadbare. The supporting cast do not lend anything to the film and none of the actors gel together. The comedy elements are weak and embarrassing. The worst thing about this film is the uk rating 12a which is extremely misleading - the language and content are not appropriate for age 12 or under children. We went with our two daughters aged 17 and 13 and they were embarrassed by the content. I can't give a full review of the film as, for the first time ever, we walked out after watching the first hour as it was so poor.",Daddy's Home
189,daddkf,Watch it at Home,2,1 January 2016,"A good movie to watch at home, but not in the theater. The first 20 minutes are OK and the last 20 minutes are good, but the middle hour you can fast forward through. Not much to see there. I liked the supporting cast, but many of the scenes are far fetched and inappropriate humor.I like Mark Wahlberg, but in this film he was not at his best. He did well some of the time, but the writers didn't give him much to work with. I thought that Linda Cardellini performed the best. Her role and performance was the most believable. If you watch the movie, don't miss the best part - the ending. I was relieved when it was over.If you like typical Will F. humor, then you will probably rate this movie a 6 or 7. If you liked The Other Guys, then you will like this one.",Daddy's Home
190,colemandevils,Save your money,1,2 January 2016,"Wow. Horrible. One of the worst films my family has ever had the unfortunate experience of seeing. Yuck. So So So very not funny. Will Fail-all is brutal. The writing is atrocious. This films condescends to anyone with an education above grade 4. The African American character ""Griff"" has no funny lines. Like none. The wife ""Sarah"" does not get anything to do but pout smile and fold her arms over her chest. Mark Wahlberg - 2 words NOT FUNNY. The writing was really only outdone by the brutal directing and awful acting. Save your money - and your time - RUN as fast as you can from this hideous excuse for a comedy - much more of a tragedy!",Daddy's Home
191,collettemourier,Walk-out bad,1,5 January 2016,"I've never written a review before, but I'm pretty sure watching this movie killed some of my brain cells. I expected Daddy's Home to be bad, but not ""I want to claw my eyes out"" bad. First of all, I am perplexed by who the target audience is. The movie is centered around a family with young kids, leading most to believe that this is a family movie. The overtly crude jokes and sexual references had the little cousin I brought with me asking me to explain what the characters meant. Talk about awkward.Not only that, but the utterly predictable plot and poor dialogue resulted in this painfully unfunny film. Did my dog, who has no basic understanding of the English language or opposable thumbs for that matter, write this script? I would've enjoyed the movie and laughed much more frequently had that been the case. There is nothing about this review that is hyperbolic. This film is mind-numbing. Please go watch Star Wars again instead.",Daddy's Home
192,max_achenbach,One of the worst movies ever watched...,1,17 June 2016,"It all started okayish in a Ferrell-style funny way. But then there were scenes where I asked myself: wtf? Did that just happen now? And why? Not funny at all... And really bad... I man really bad! Wasn't there budget for either some kind of plot-quality-control or better CGI-artists and stunt-coordinators? After 37 minutes I had to quit.. It was just so bad. I usually don't turn off movies... I even force myself to watch bad movies to the bitter end. But this was really bad... There is only one movie that I turned off earlier: record holder with being turned off after 10 minutes is ""Eagle Eyes"". But this is a well-earned second place in my ranking of really bad movies. I just felt I had to share this...",Daddy's Home
193,bucior-60667,Seriously mislabeled movie,1,24 January 2016,"Just the fact that a movie is ABOUT a family does NOT make it a ""family movie"". Completely inappropriate for the children. We watched the trailer and it was kind of fun so we decided to see it. Unfortunately, ALL the funny moments of the movie are already in the trailer. If you care about just funny stuff, then just watch the trailer and save $$$s and time. Oh, wait, the masturbation scene is not in the trailer. So maybe if you are all about funny stuff there is still something in it for you. The rest of the movie is a horrid story, full of foul words. Complete disaster.",Daddy's Home
194,jacktwyss,Wahlberg and Ferrell are Great,8,28 February 2016,"If you want a comprehensive plot, intelligent humor, and developed characters, THIS IS NOT YOUR MOVIE! But if you're looking for a lot of laughs and something to do, go see Daddy's Home. When I saw this everyone in the theater was cracking up. It's slapstick at its finest. It was almost impossible not to like the duo in their roles. Will Ferrell portrays sweet, lovable stepfather Brad, who just wants his kids to love him. But when tough biker/Marine Dusty (Wahlberg), the kids' real father, arrives from Cameroon, Brad's world is turned upside-down. It's packed with laughs and has a very heartwarming ending. This is not a movie for the Academy Awards. If you are a serious film critic, do not waste your money. But to everyone else I recommend this picture.",Daddy's Home
195,james_dutch-43425,"Two ""dads"" (bio and step) vie for the children's affection",10,8 March 2016,"I'm glad to have watched this movie, loads of laughs! I postponed watching it because of all the bad reviews; now wish I hadn't! It's incredibly funny, probably the funniest I've seen in a year. Wahlberg and Ferrell are perfect together in this and though it's hilarious, at times the tension between the two ""dads"" is lifelike. Perhaps what makes it even more funny? There's physical comedy as well as subtle humor throughout. It's definitely better than some of my other ""dad"" favorites like ""Daddy Daycare"" (which was good but not great like this). Some examples of my taste are: ""Christmas Vacation"" and ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"". I'd compare it to the movie ""Are We There Yet?"", only better. I gave it a 10 because it's definitely a movie I'll watch again and again!",Daddy's Home
196,igormicunovic,Don't even try to watch it. Truly pathetic.,1,10 March 2016,"I am not professional critic but educated in photography. In my opinion movie plot goes to sarcasm, now and then sadism and overall no taste! I am true movie fun since my childhood and I am in love with all generations of American actors and decades of movie excellence. Well, this movie is kind a pity, miserable and with pathetic screenplay. I believe that movie director has sick idea of parenting. Also important is where does it go tolerance in American society? Does It have limits? In my opinion this movie expresses artificial step-dad behaviour as family interaction in total. Having known about normal American society as family interactions, this movie plot expresses horror but no comedy. Better put the finger at your eyebrow and think folks!",Daddy's Home
197,charlesh-89966,"Overall funny , at times made you cry and worth the watch!! Pleasantly pleased.",8,27 March 2016,"I didn't really honestly think much going into watching this movie. Butthere had not been many comedy movies lately that had caught my interest. Upon watching the trailer, which i thought was somewhat entertaining, i decided to give this movie a try. I must say that i was pleasantly pleased. The movie was pretty funny and even had a few moments where one may break a tear or two.I really liked the chemistry between the two main characters, Will and Mark Whalberg. Considering the type of lame comedy movies there are today this one was a breath of fresh air.I would watch this movie again.Overall i recommend this movie!!",Daddy's Home
198,sellerhong,worst movie ever,1,1 April 2016,"This movie is one of the worst movie i every watched, This movie is about a loving foster father who work hard to provide for his family, he gave them love, food and shelter. Until one day the biological father (Fun Dad) came out of nowhere, he took everything from him, the children, the house and even his work. This show isn't really a comedy as i don't even find this movie with a pinch of funny. So glad i didn't pay to watch this show, this is more of a tragedy than a comedy. The foster dad,i had never seen anyone so clueless, what's worst the end, the biological got another super hot wife. Moral of the story, don't bother about your children, let someone take care of it, than come back and take everything back, god isn't going to punish you. Sorry i watched only 40 minutes of the movie and i forwarded to the end, the front is horrible the ending is terrible. Its like the movie is not even funny and they are trying to squeeze out the funny.",Daddy's Home
199,tybis,Bad characters and even worse script.,3,6 April 2016,It was quite boring. The moral I got was if you buy your kids' stuff they will love you. Mark Wahlberg's character was almost unbearable as was Will Ferrell's. The kids swore more than both Mark and Will combined. I would not recommend this to anyone. The only good part was towards the end. Talladega nights was funny and Step Brothers was even more funny. The Other Guys was hilarious but then they make this movie and it was awful. A lot of parts made me cringe and look away and even more just did not make sense. It did not make me laugh hardly at all.,Daddy's Home
200,troksoy,predictable,3,9 April 2016,"first of, huge fan of both mark and will. But this movie is funny one time throughout the whole thing. And never has any surprises in store. I had high hopes for this movie, but they managed to ruin them. Also the chemistry between the cast seems very off. They make it seem like the whole movie was shot in 1 week, between the hours of 9-5, mon to Friday. And they make it look like a travesty most of the time. All i can say is that will and mark needs to be ruder, and have the balls to try and offend more. People wants to be offended, at least when you have every possible chance to make comedy gold of so many situations",Daddy's Home
201,ClassyGilmore,Horrible Example and you just ran off my future Husband...,3,14 May 2016,"First I appreciate that the movie was not average same old story lines that couldn't never possibly happen in today's reality or feeding fairy tales to kids which will disappoint them after turning 18....but it was not believable to a actual blended family(maw), but believable enough for men to be single till 45(maybe) When most kids are out of high school. If I was a single male that would make me run too.It's not you its me hunni. Now my true Opinion Willie needs a drink, as bad as that sounds. Hannibali was what made Will and Mark movie kinda funny and saved their movie reputation. Good save!!! But I read between the lines...moving on to wifey plain wrong for withholding information on her ex husband from her new husband. Us women wouldn't do that and if we did best believe my now husband would swabbed the kids and run a background check with results by dinner time on the same day shipping. And no no no ex staying on the same property let alone in the house, no lasting functional married couple would this be allowed in the castle. But the participation for school crap,crabby bossy, (need some) volunteer-lady and kids activities are the truth but honestly ,should have casted a real blended family and come on Wille snap out of it and stop getting out done your the Drake of Funny... A 3 for different tho.",Daddy's Home
202,phoenixhamdorf,Daddy Is Home Baby!!!,5,26 November 2017,"I expected better from this movie, I will admit the jew himself ""Will Ferret"" and ""Mark Gangbang"" make a good duo. They were good in ""The Bad Guys"" but this movie wasn't the best. All my autistic friends like this movie but some of them probably like Elf as well the dumb ba*****s. By the title of this movie I thought I was in for some Step-Dad and Daughter porno but I was heavily misguided. When I watched this movie all I could think about was, ""Sh*t I wish my dad came home"" but sadly just like this movie he disappointed me. I give this a 5/10 f***s given.",Daddy's Home
