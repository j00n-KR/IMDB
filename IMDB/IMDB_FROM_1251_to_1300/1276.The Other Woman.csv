0,SnoopyStyle,Funny sporadically,6,21 August 2014,"Successful professional Carly Whitten (Cameron Diaz) has a new man in her life. Mark King (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) is the perfect guy except she doesn't know he's married. Something's off and she walks off angry. Her father Frank (Don Johnson) dealing with his fifth divorce convinces her to go back to him. At his house, she meets his wife Kate (Leslie Mann). Carly wants to end the situation but clingy crazy Kate keeps bothering her until they become friends. Then they find out that he's seeing another girl Amber (Kate Upton). They bring along Kate's brother Phil (Taylor Kinney).Cameron Diaz is way too cold and too angry. She has to be nicer to justify her becoming a friend to wacky Leslie Mann. Leslie is her nutty wacky persona and at least is able to keep the energy high. I think they have a good possibility of being fun comedy duo. It takes them a while to get there. Kate Upton brings a good Bambi vibe. She's like the mascot of the group. This is funny sporadically mostly generated by Leslie's manic presence. Otherwise, it does struggle to maintain its comedic tone.",The Other Woman
1,Prismark10,Your cheating heart,3,6 June 2016,"The Other Woman is an unfunny, bland and messy romantic comedy that still finds itself sunk by its wafer thin characters and other better films that dealt with cheating husbands/boyfriends. Director Nick Cassavetes is far removed from the talent of his father.Carly Whitten (Cameron Diaz) finds out her rich, successful businessman boyfriend Mark is married. When she meets the wife (Leslie Mann) they find out that they actually awkwardly like each other in an odd couple way. Later on they find out that he is cheating on them both with a younger and more buxom Amber (Kate Upton) so all three women team up for revenge by humiliating him.Just so the audience finds the discomfort that Mark goes through is OK such as pooping in his pants because of secretly added laxatives they also make him someone who is framing his wife to take the rap for his dicey business dealings.A tired, contrived and laboured film.",The Other Woman
2,claudio_carvalho,Annoying and Silly Comedy,3,13 August 2014,"In New York, the successful lawyer Carly Whitten (Cameron Diaz) is in love with her handsome boyfriend Mark King (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) and she expects to introduce him to her father Frank (Don Johnson). However Mark tells her that he needs to travel to his house in Connecticut since his housemaid has just reported a plumbing problem in the basement and he need to fix it. Carly decides to travel to meet him without previous notice and she finds that Mark is married with Kate King (Leslie Mann).Carly returns to New York and on the next morning, Kate visits her at her job to get information about her relationship with her husband. They conclude that he is a cheater and befriend each other. Soon they learn that Mark has a younger girlfriend, Amber (Kate Upton), and they befriend her. The trio decides to team-up and plot revenge against Mark.""The Other Woman"" is an annoying and silly feminist comedy about a cheater and his three women – his wife and two mistresses. Leslie Mann is an irritating and unfunny actress and it is impossible to laugh with her gags. Her dumb character ends president of several companies in a ridiculous situation. The wooden Kate Upton is absolutely inexpressive and also unfunny and not hot. The awful story and screenplay waste Cameron Diaz and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau. The laundry or embezzlement of money is a mess impossible to be understood since Mark's partner is making money and happy with the partnership. Last but not the least, it is maybe the movie with greatest number of fake reviews in IMDb promoting it. When you see ten stars, click on the name of the reviewer and see how many reviews he or she has in IMDb. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Mulheres ao Ataque"" (""Women on the Attack"")",The Other Woman

The three women form a sisterhood making me feel like I was watching a ""Sex in the City"" episode. Together they conspire to ""hurt"" Mark.The movie is a chick flick. Cameron Diaz is not the spry Charlies' Angel anymore. Leslie Mann plays an unrealistic character that was fun to watch. And Kate Upton ran in slow motion in a white bikini.

4,kosmasp,Shaming itself ... unfortunately,5,19 September 2014,"For a first movie Kate Upton is doing a decent job. Recent (Summer 2014) photos from her aside (which I haven't seen yet), because you won't see her revealed like that in this. But this is supposed to be a light fun comedy. Unfortunately sometimes the lightness takes over too much and makes you feel dizzy ... that is if you care, that it doesn't make much sense and that actual talent is wasted (not to mention good jokes too).The movie still has some fine scenes, which mostly work because of Mann and Diaz. The male actor (main villain) is brought down to serve as a caricature. You might not mind, but good movie making looks a bit different. If you don't care that much you might be able to enjoy this more for its silliness. Otherwise try not to overreact on the clichés and the very easy to read story (yes, you'll know who with whom and where anyone is about to go) ...",The Other Woman
5,paul_haakonsen,A comedy about women for women...,5,16 July 2014,"I must admit that I had initially expected more from this movie, especially given the synopsis and the people starring in it. I had expected a bigger amount of comedy, to be honest. But instead, this turned out to be more of a woman's movie, more than it was a proper comedy. Don't get me wrong, it is not a bad movie, but it is was just aimed more at a woman audience than a man/woman audience.The story is about Kate (played by Leslie Mann) who finds out that her husband Mark (played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) is cheating around on her, and when she seeks out the other woman, Carly (played by Cameron Diaz), a very unlikely friendship comes to be, and together the wronged women set out to make the adulterer pay for his heinous deed.While the movie was entertaining enough for what it was, I was expecting more comedy. But the people in the various roles were doing great jobs, and the lead women really carried the movie nicely.The comedy aspects to the movie were subtle, yet well used, but mind you that this is hardly the type of comedy that will have you laughing while tears trickle down your cheeks.""The Other Woman"" will appeal to a large group of people, of that I am sure, but it just didn't live up to what I had expected. And as such, it turned out to be a mediocre experience for me, and thus I am rating it a 5 out of 10 stars.",The Other Woman
6,tavm,Me and my movie theatre-working friend laughed aplenty at The Other Woman,8,3 May 2014,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both enjoyed this comedy about three women getting revenge on one man. There's his wife (Leslie Mann), his paramour (Cameron Diaz) who ends it after finding out about that wife, and the younger paramour (Kate Upton) who finds out from the previous two. Quite hilarious we both found this and nice team-up on those three. Oh, and Don Johnson appears as the father of one of those three. When his name appeared on screen, my friend says he didn't know he was in it which then made me mention that ""Miami Vice"" was nearly 30 years ago (though neither of us watched it much since ""Dallas"" was on at the same time) which then reminded us of our age especially when I then pointed out to him the placement of a couple of songs from that era as well when they were played (A cover version of Pat Benatar's ""Love is a Battlefield"" and Cyndi Lauper's ""Girls Just Want to Have Fun""). Anyway, in summary, we both found The Other Woman a lot of fun.",The Other Woman
7,edwagreen,**,4,14 January 2015,"Cameron Diaz reminds me of the girl who couldn't wait to finish high school and enters the world as a completely immature fool. This picture goes along quiet well in preserving that image.In this film, she is an executive who discovers that her boyfriend is married. She befriends the wife and along with another woman who has been sleeping with the fiend as well, the three plot revenge on our Casanova.There is a good acting performance by Leslie Mann as the wife who goes from being a fool to being quite a shrewd character. By film's end, the guy is ruined and in the process, the girls find themselves. Some of their choices may appear to be inane, but after all, isn't the entire film just that?",The Other Woman

The screenplay was written by Melissa Stack and it was directed by Nick Cassavetes.The movie boasts of a talented cast.Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann manage to elicit lots of laughter in a lot of scenes.They basically carried to movie from beginning to end and had a lot of wonderful and funny scenes together.Too bad that Kate Upton was somewhat underused except to show her curves and big boobs in the beach.As for the story,it was definitely far from original and refreshing but nevertheless it would not disappoint viewers who are want a movie that has lots of funny scenes.",The Other Woman
9,Scarecrow-88,The Other Woman,5,11 January 2015,"Nick Cassavetes of all people directed this female empowerment chick flick (this movie was ridiculously popular at the box office) regarding three women (a wife and two mistresses) cheated on by a sleazy, hunky ""start-up businessman"" and how they plot to get even with him. Comic hi-jinx ensue. The women try to conceal their partnership, attack him with laxatives, estrogen, and hormones, and avoid allowing him to seduce them. Out of the trio, Leslie Mann scores the home run as the ""walls come crashing down"" emotionally distraught wife with everything to lose, while Cameron Diaz is the strong, assertive type, independent and eventually supportive of the cause to take this scoundrel down (he's also a thief, fraudulently using false start up businesses to take money from those who invest in them). Kate Upton is the jaw-droppingly stunning supermodel he meets and sleeps with in Miami who joins forces with the ladies to see the cheating scumbag fall. Before you know it all three women see the chance to move on, with Mann obviously having the toughest time letting go (and why wouldn't she?). All Mann needs is the encouragement to realize she can in fact find another more worthy relationship down the road while Diaz falls for her brother (a contractor) and Upton has found herself a new romantic attachment. This is the kind of film that follows a wronged innocent woman (women) and sees her (them) eventually overcome her vulnerabilities and insecurities for a better outcome. The fraud perpetrated by Mark (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) and all his lies/deceit will certainly come back to haunt himthe finale should enrich the hearts of plenty of female movie-watchers. Mann rising above just being a doormat suburban housewife and becoming a success story will perhaps bring quite a bit of joy to the appropriate audience. Don Johnson's small part as Cameron Diaz's father is a nice addition to the film. The result is never in question, and there's not a doubt all three women were bound to come out better than when the movie first started. The chemistry of the leads is an essential ingredient to the film's overwhelming success. Perfect for a rotten Valentine's Day when you just want to see a womanizing cretin get his. Not my kind of movie, but I see why it was a hit.",The Other Woman

I didn't expect to like this as much as I did. Leslie Mann is really the whole show. She's hilarious. Cameron Diaz is good, too. About what you expect from her. Kate Upton is beautiful to look at, which is her primary reason for being in this I suppose. She gets little to do but does fine with what she has. I was surprised to see Nicki Minaj doing a competent job in a supporting role. Don Johnson and the guy from Game of Thrones are also good. It's a predictable story but entertaining.

11,grantss,"Stupid, unfunny, pointless",1,30 March 2015,"Stupid, unfunny, pointless.I'm guessing this was meant to be a comedy, as it fails at drama and there are some attempts at humour. However, it is not funny at all and is just silly.Plot is so contrived and pointless that it is irritating.Probably the most evidence you need that this movie is craptacular is that Nicki Manaj has a role in it. Yes, one of the most moronic people on the planet and the biggest sign that modern music and society are screwed, is in this movie. Pretty much your standard movie for Cameron Diaz nowadays and Don Johnson probably just needed the money.If this was meant to be Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau's breakout role in movies, having made a name for himself on Game of Thrones, he is going to have to wait a while longer...",The Other Woman

The two women unexpectedly bond, at which point they are both further surprised to find out that he has yet another woman on the boil, voluptuous youngster Amber. The three women put their heads together to decide what can be done.In many ways this is a fairly standard ""sex wars"" comedy. It has a decent set-up, and features likable performances from the three main characters. It is somewhat overlong, and Leslie Mann has clearly been let loose on a long leash to improvise. This is mostly fine since her performance is both funny (especially physically) and touching, but she could usefully have been reined in here and there. Kate Upton, in her movie debut, proves to have a very warm and natural screen presence to add to her more obvious assets. And the film features one of the best ""comeuppance"" sequences since Ian Carmichael's tennis match with Terry-Thomas in School For Scoundrels (no, not that one, the original).",The Other Woman
13,anaconda-40658,The Other Woman Should Have Replaced Upton.,7,1 June 2015,"The Other Woman (2014): Dir: Nick Cassavetes / Cast: Cameron Diaz, Leslie Mann, Kate Upton, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Don Johnson: Revenge comedy that pitches the possibility of the competition being a potential ally. Cameron Diaz plays a successful career woman who learns that the man she has been dating for two months is actually married. To make matters more complicated his wife seeks her out and ends up trying to attempt a connection through her brokenness. This leads to comical moments as Diaz doesn't want this woman around yet she cannot shake her. To make things even more deceiving they both learn that he has another fling whom he is courting on a supposed business trip. Eventually the three women band together to bring their suitor down leading to a predictable conclusion. While not as great as Nine to Five, it avoids the revenge theme of The First Wives Club. Its premise will appeal to women and its structure nicely takes its time. Nick Cassavetes previously directed Diaz in My Sister's Keeper, and she is the best element of this film. She is bold yet grows to sympathize with the wife. She is played with comic drunken hysterics by Leslie Mann who struggles to fathom what her marriage has become. Kate Upton as the mistress is lifeless, and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau as the male suitor is primarily just a dart board for the tactics of the three women. Don Johnson is underused as Diaz's womanizing father who is into younger women. This is a decent comedy about friends becoming from pain, but it pales to that other woman's revenge film called Nine to Five. Score: 7 / 10",The Other Woman
14,phd_travel,Unfunny and painful - it's no 'First Wives Club',3,20 July 2014,"There are hardly any jokes and no laugh out loud moments. The humor is strained unoriginal and the crude toilet part is so done to death. The dialog is obvious and predictable. Even when they started to exact their revenge it wasn't delightful to watch at all. What they made Leslie Mann do - acting so loopy was just painful. The drunk thing was repetitive. The ending with Nikolaj Coaster Waldau walking into glass is not funny at all. Cameron isn't so good at acting the serious one. Better as the crazy one. She was better in Bad Teacher. Kate Upton didn't have many lines and looks quite sweet. Of course her voluptuous body is used to full effect. Taylor Kinney as Cameron's love interest is a bit under utilized.Can't help but compare to another wronged woman revenge comedy ""The First Wives Club"". That one was funny and delightful. Melissa Stack is not good enough a writer to write a movie - she needed help. The talented cast could do nothing with this material.The only good point is that it's pretty to look at with nicely decorated sets and beach resort scenery.See it if you are a fan of one of the stars but be warned it's not funny.",The Other Woman
15,gradyharp,'If we find anymore mistresses I'm going to have to send her to rehab.',5,14 January 2015,"Director Nick Cassavetes and writer Melissa seem to have jumped on the 'Hangover 1 – 3' etc line of thinking and made a film that tries very hard to make having numerous mistresses seem a thousand laughs. If you like the potty mouth slapstick comedy type film populated with pretty people then you may (if you're in the right mood) like this naughty little 'men are beasts' story. After discovering her boyfriend (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau – 'Game of Thrones') is married, Carly Whitten (Cameron Diaz – 'Bad Teacher', 'Sex Tape', etc) tries to get her ruined life back on track. But when she accidentally meets the wife (Leslie Mann –'Knocked up', '17 Again', 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin', etc) he's been cheating on, she realizes they have much in common, and her sworn enemy becomes her greatest friend. When yet another affair is discovered – Amber (Kate Upton - model), all three women team up to plot mutual revenge on their cheating, lying, three-timing SOB.Lots of drinking, lots of crusty one liners, and lots of wasted talent here, but it is a chick flick that obviously has a definite audience. Don Johnson, Taylor Kinney represent the men's side, and the supporting cast is huge.",The Other Woman
16,Hellmant,"Silly, sexist and almost completely unfunny!",3,10 September 2014,"'THE OTHER WOMAN': One and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Revenge comedy flick about three women who bond after discovering they've all been sleeping with the same man, and then plot revenge on him. Cameron Diaz, Leslie Mann and supermodel Kate Upton star as the three women, out for revenge, and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau plays the despicable cheater they're seeking vengeance on. Taylor Kinney, Don Johnson and rapper Nicki Minaj also costar in the movie. It was directed by veteran actor, and filmmaker, Nick Cassavetes (who's directed other popular chick-flicks like 'THE NOTEBOOK') and written by first time feature film writer Melissa Stack. I found the movie to be silly, sexist and almost completely unfunny.Diaz plays Carly, a lawyer who recently started dating a handsome ladies man named Mark (Coster-Waldau). When she decides to surprise him one night at his house, wearing a sexy outfit, she discovers Mark is married. His wife, Kate (Mann), is just as surprised to find out Mark has a girlfriend and the two women form a friendship, based on their mutual depression and disgust for Mark. They later learn that Mark is also having an affair with another woman, the much younger Amber (Upton). The three ladies then team together in getting revenge on Mark; by doing things like putting estrogen in his smoothies, putting hair removal cream in his shampoo and filling his drinks with laxatives.The movie is about as unoriginal as a comedy film can get and the jokes are horrendous and painful to watch. Mann has been good in other movies (like those directed by her husband Judd Apatow) but here she severely overacts. Diaz is OK but she's a little too old for her part. Upton looks great but can't act. I would have much rather seen Minaj in Upton's role (and she's by far the hottest woman in the movie, in my opinion). The characters are all stereotypes, and insulting to both genders, and the comedy just doesn't work (for the most part). There's a few good laughs, here and there, but they're way too few and far between.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/Xz0GNkin4cw",The Other Woman
17,Robert_duder,HIlarious? No. Passable and entertaining...barely.,6,23 May 2014,"Now I know many of you will say that this is a guy's perspective on a woman's movie. I'm not your average guy. I am a movie fanatic and I LOVE so called ""Chick Flicks."" I wanted to see this as much as my wife did. I had already heard several people call it the funniest movie they had seen in ages and the trailer looked great. It wasn't great. It was okay and it was decently entertaining and it did get significantly better towards the end but it was still a bit of a let down to me. I think this film falls under the ""Bridesmaids"" category. Its a film made for and marketed squarely at adult females. This is a very small market with great potential and if you can hit the right chords and impress those females then you've got a huge hit on your hands. The problem is that the film pool is so small that the demographic latches onto anything and make themselves believe its great when its average at best. The characters are mostly irritating (some more than others), and the script is just not funny. The various physical gags performed feel completely forced as does much of the humour. I think it actually struggles to be a comedy and pushes itself in that direction.Cameron Diaz is hit and miss for me and this was mostly a miss. She certainly is no stranger to comedy especially slapstick and rude humour but her character in this is very predictable and obvious. She is okay in the role but doesn't really stand out. Leslie Mann is great in small doses. As a co-star of this film...she is just downright irritating. She gets a little better later on but overall watching her perform in this film is excruciating. She is whiny and awful and you feel no empathy before her. I get that her performance is supposed to be funny but its not. The one thing she has going for her in this movie is that her chemistry with Diaz is decent enough to carry the ""buddy film"" feel so it works. I actually think they should have given more screen time to Kate Upton. Her role could have been the funniest of the three as the ""dumb blonde"" that endears herself to you. She gets very little development and scenes and the three of them seem to have a good little thing going in their scenes together. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau is very good as their boyfriend and husband who is cheating on all of them. He is attractive, believable and a scum bag all at once. He gives probably the best performance in the film because you love to hate him and that's exactly what they're going for. Solid supporting performances by Don Johnson and Taylor Kinney (who should have got more screen time as well.) Total waste of Nicki Minaj who looked ridiculous, talked ridiculous, was not believable but was thankfully in a very small role.Director Nick Cassavetes is building himself a tidy little resume. He directed what some would call the most romantic film of all time (The Notebook) but was he really trying to create any sort of art here? I think they handed him a bland script that he knew would make money from the female population and he went with it. I mean, you have cast appeal, you've got the perfect demographic and yet it struggles to be funny. At times its darkly funny (when our hated man leaves at the end bloodied and broken to the extreme I looked at my wife and we wondered...why is that funny?) Either be dark and twisted or be slapstick funny but don't combine the two. It needed a fair bit of work before it was ready to be ""comedy of the year."" I hate Seth Rogen and I hate raunchy, unintelligent comedies but Neighbors beats this in the comedy category hands down. Still some seem to love it so what do I know? I know this...it was passable, forgettable and wouldn't be a go-to comedy for me. 6/10",The Other Woman
18,bowmanblue,Couldn't get past 30 minutes,3,13 December 2014,"Okay, I have to confess two things: the first is that I'm a guy and the second is that this 'review' is based on the first half hour only. I know this is a 'chick flick,' but I am a fan of Cameron Diaz and always thought that I could sit through her performance in anything. And, to be fair, it wasn't Cameron Diaz that destroyed this film for me.Leslie Mann. Why? She's clearly a talented actress as I've seen her in other stuff and she was fine. However, I just found her more annoying that the offspring of Jar Jar Binks and Ruby Rhod. She was annoying. Totally annoying. The premise (from what I gathered from the first half hour) is that Leslie Mann's husband is having an affair with Cameron Diaz. The two women – accidentally – meet each other and – sort of – become friends. However, the first problem I had was that I couldn't believe any man would actually MARRY Leslie Mann's character. He was supposed to be an intelligent, successful guy – if he could pull someone like Cameron Diaz then why did he sadly himself to this nattering, needy, never-ending yapping woman? Seriously, I know I've mentioned that she's annoying, but she's annoying when she's getting in cars. She's annoying when she's lying down. She's annoying when she's walking her stupidly-large dog. And, when you tell her to go away and that you don't want anything to do with her, she turns up at your flat door (after breaking into the communal area), bringing you dinner and expecting you to be pleased to see her.It was about at that stage when I decided to turn the film off. Yes, Cameron Diaz was good (as was the little bit of Kate Upton I actually saw). It was just Leslie Mann that may well give me nightmares for many years to come.But, after all that, I checked the other reviews. People are giving it between eight and ten out of ten. I guess other people saw something in it that I didn't. Maybe Leslie Mann has a secret fan club that I'm unaware of. I'll stick to 'Bad Teacher.'",The Other Woman

Nothing works in this ""comedy"" - it's not funny, not a single real laugh through a whole movie. Acting was just lame, ye, i know, this is comedy but lame is lame, no matter what genre it is. Kate Upton, well, she was in this just for looks, and only for looks, she's super cute, but acting, lets just say is not her strongest side. So what else? Nothing. Absuolutely nothing. The only reason i saw this film is because of the director Nick Cassavetes, which has made some really good pictures (""The Notebook"" 2004; ""My Sister's Keeper"" 2009). But these where good romantic / dramas, and ""The Other Woman"" is a absolute disaster to compare.

23,pennyelenabooks,Hmmm,5,19 November 2014,"Carly is a professional woman who thinks that she has finally found the one. However, soon she will discover that he is married. Even worse, his wife, Kate, knowing that Carly is her husbands girlfriend, becomes friends with Carly and the two of them, along with his other girlfriend Amber, start a quest to make him pay. Even though ""The other woman"" is a comedy, it lucks of humor. Well, not entirely, there are some funny moments, but I expected them to be more. Fortunately the humor wasn't that roughly sexual offensive that the comedies tend to have those days, so that was a plus for the film. The movie focuses on the relationship that it's developed between Carly and Kate mainly, the revenge plans and the maturing of the characters. In the end, it ends up as a story about the friendship between women than the theme that had started with, the cheating of the husband. The performances were good, I certainly hope that Niki Minaj will stick to music and not try an acting career again, but that's just me. Kate Upton was okay, playing the foolish blond, but that was an ""easy"" role, so I can't really say if she is good at it or not. For now, she passes her first test. Finally, something that really bothered me throughout the entire movie was the continuation of the scenes. It seemed that it was roughly made, just cut and paste by someone who didn't know how to connect the previous scene to the next one. And the music, even though it was good, didn't really fit for the scenes that was chosen to play. So, 5 out of 10.",The Other Woman
24,leonblackwood,Silly more than funny! 4/10,4,29 November 2014,"Review: Personally, I didn't find this movie that funny. The acting was way over the top, especially from Leslie Mann who went around shouting out her business were ever she went. The concept also wasn't that great or original and I found the ending pretty corny. The movie is based around a cheating husband who blatantly gets caught out by his wife and 2 of the women that he is doing the dirty with. The dashing Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, who plays Jaime Lannister in the Game Of Thrones series, is finally left without a leg to stand on after the 3 wounded ladies become best friends and join forces to take the love of there life. CORNY! Anyway, there are a few laughs in the movie but they weren't that amazing. Its definitely a movie for all of the cheated women out there but from a man's point of view, it really wasn't that entertaining or interesting. Disappointing!Round-Up: All the way through the film I was trying to work out what had changed on Cameron Diaz's face because she looked completely different from her early days in the Mask. I finally realised that she has had loads of botox injected into her cheekbones and her nose has changed shape. Her leathery skin also looked a bit weird and her toned down acting in this movie really didn't suit her. I'm used to seeing her taking the lead and making a fool out of herself, but the director chose to give that role to Leslie Mann who was crazy throughout the movie. She also had weird looking skin and the body of a 5 year old, which is why it wasn't that surprising that her husband cheated on her with the beautiful Kate Upton, who seemed a bit useless in the movie. Finally, I think that the director was trying to pull in a bigger audience by casting Nicki Minaj as the secretary, but I found her nasal accent, outrageous clothes and strange proportioned body, a pointless addition to this unfunny chick flick.Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $197million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into their chick flicks about a cheating husband who gets taken down by his wife and 2 of his mistresses. 4/10",The Other Woman
25,matthewssilverhammer,Leslie Mann is funny...But TOW is a hot mess,3,3 May 2014,"TOW was originally rated R, but whatever comedic teeth the movie had in its first version were clearly left on the cutting room floor. As it is, the movie teeters on being funny instead of actually being funny. The three actresses are giving their all, but their efforts can't fix the final edit. Ultimately, a couple of funny scenes don't forgive a movie full of awfully predictable writing and sloppy direction. It's the story of three women who meet, become friends and seek revenge on the man cheating them. It's a story of rich, privileged people being selfish and obnoxious. It's a story of women becoming friends minutes after meeting each other. It's editing and music are dated and jarring, leaving no connection to the audience. It bombards us with jokesif only those jokes were funny. Sadly, other than a couple strong physical comedy moments, it's largely laughless. Towards the end of TOW, one of the women chides the cheating husband/boyfriend, saying, ""None of those women or money or objects can fill the hole inside you"". If only the creators of this film had heeded this advice. Sure, its casted well, Upton and Diaz doing their best, and Mann almost making something out of nothing. Unfortunately, instead of fully leaning on its talented cast to run comically wild, it relies on outdated story devices (Freeze frames?! Retrospectives?! THREE MONTAGES?!) and cheap humor (Hidden laxatives?! Seriously?!) to fill the soulless hole in its cinematic heart. Clichéd, sloppy, and rushed, TOW is a hot mess.",The Other Woman
26,lisafordeay,From the director of The Notebook comes this comedy about getting it even with a man,5,12 June 2015,"The Other Woman was released in 2014 and I never even seen this movie before as I heard it got A lot of bad reviews and that it wasn't worth watching. So I seen it yesterday on the bargain sale at my local store and I decided to give it a shot. Cameron Diaz(There's Something About Mary),Lesile Mann(George Of The Jungle)and newcomer Kate Upton(who reminds me of someone)team up in this film about a New York attorney named Carly(played by Diaz)who is in love with a man who she gets it on with named Mark King(played by Nikolaj Coaster). But what she doesn't know is that he is a married man and is married to Kate(Mann)who Carly later befriends as Kate has Carly hounded about her husband(with no bitch fighting whatsoever)so Carly gives in to Kate and team up together to find out what other mistress her womanizing husband has. Turns out he is having another affair with a younger woman named Amber(Upton) and the two girls decided to team up with Amber as they tell her that Mark is married to Kate(Mann's charcther). So the 3 girls pull a John Tucker Must Die scenario and try and get even with Mark. One scene in particular that I found hilarious was where Mark got this stuff that helps him move his bowels and he needs to go to the bathroom a lot to get rid off all the waste in his bowels. That just cracked me up. Another scene which was funny was the part where the 3 girls go to the Bahamas and catch Mark with another woman(when he clearly told Kate that he has this job and he wanted Kate to sign documents unaware that Kate becomes a CEO for his company in the end and has had it with Mark and fills for a divorce). But will he come clean to Kate and the other two girls(Upton and Diaz) about what he did was wrong?Also starring Nikki Minaj(who wears a ton of wigs in this movie and her accent is really annoying btw),overall though I thought this film was going to be really stupid as we have seen this before with that 2006 teen comedy John Tucker Must Die and the Diane Keaton,Bette Midler and Goldie Hawn flick The First Wives Club,I actually kinda like this film.Its by all means amazing but this is the kind of film Taylor Swift or Meg Ryan(if she stayed in the spotlight)would star in together. As its all about getting it even with a man who happens to be a narcissistic womanizing jerk who can't help being so charming. I was always a fan of Cameron Diaz(since her debut in The Mask with Jim Carrey back in 1994 when she was like 24 or 23 at the time filming)and also I liked the rest of the actresses too in the film. Lady Gaga's future husband Taylor Kinney also stars as Cameron Diaz's soon to be boyfriend who is a brother of Lesile Mann's charcther.Verdict: A great movie night with all your girl pals. I am giving it 3 stars and a C+ 5/10Hilarious",The Other Woman
27,freemantle_uk,Girls don't want to have fun,2,3 May 2014,"When a film has two jokes involving defecation then you know it is hardly stretching itself to be a high class comedy. The Other Woman is lazy affair filled with mugging performances that only occasionally raises a smile.Carly (Cameron Diaz) is a high flying corporate lawyer in New York City who has seemingly has found the perfect man she can setting down with, Mark King (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau). But there is a big problem, Mark is a cheating scumbag and when his wife suburban Kate (Leslie Mann) finds out he was having an affair she confronts Carly. The pair form an unlikely friendship and when they find out Mark is having an affair with a much younger woman, Amber (Kate Upton) the trio plot their revenge.The Other Woman is a comedy of the lowest common denominator, using easy slapstick, sex jokes and the aforementioned cruder jokes about bodily fluids being expelled as well as Ms. Diaz getting hit in the face with a pair of a Great Dane's testicles. The humour is obvious throughout, such as when Carly tells Kate not to let her dog on the furniture and you can guess what happens next. And there are a number of conversations about sex, including graphic conservation about women including shaving their Brazilian areas (this is a film with a 12A rating). There was the occasional witty line in the rough but it is too few and far between.The Other Woman is an over acted aware with Mann being the worst as she mugs her way through the film, overplaying Kate's naïveté and ditzy personality. She cries and plays dumb constantly as she suffers through the slapstick shenanigans. Even Coaster-Waldau who has done great work on Game of Thrones and the Norwegian thriller Headhunters embarrasses himself in the film, going through many indignities that is beneath him. The character of Amber is so underwriting that it was unclear if she was made to be fairly intelligent or very dumb she easily flips either way.Nick Cassavetes slums his way in the director's chair, using a soundtrack of pop songs to spell out the events on screen. It's so bad that the Mission Impossible theme when the women follow Mark and a guitar riff when revealing Upton and her buttocks. Cassavetes bland direction shows he has no real skill for timing, letting his actors run amok and had no sense of comic timing and use easy art and costume short-cuts, like all the suburban women having the clichéd blouses and sweater look.The Other Woman is a lazy comedy using crass humour for a cheap laugh. It hardly has anything to offer and it will be a blot on many careers.Please visit www.rocknreelreviews.com",The Other Woman
28,stevendbeard,Laugh Out Loud Funny,7,25 April 2014,"I saw ""The Other Woman"", starring Cameron Diaz-Bad Teacher, The Green Hornet_2011; Leslie Mann-This is 40, The Cable Guy; Nikolaj Coaster- Waldau-Game of Thrones_t.v., Black Hawk Down; Kate Upton-The Three Stooges_2012, Tower Heist and Don Johnson-Django Unchained, Machete.From the previews, this may seem like a chick-flick, but it was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. Cameron plays a single, successful lawyer that is dating Nikolaj pretty exclusively-she thinks he could be the one. Then, she finds out that he is married to Leslie, and being the morally upstanding person that she is, breaks things off with Nimolaj. Then, the unthinkable happens; Cameron and Leslie become BFF's and then, they find out Nikolaj is dating Kate on the side. Kate is brought in to their little girl's club and they all plot revenge on poor old Nikolaj. Don plays Cameron's father, who gives Cameron fatherly advice. I always like Cameron in just about anything she does, Leslie is very funny here-she is usually good but she is hilarious here-and Kate is...Well, she is just gorgeous, especially in a bikini. It's rated ""PG-13"" for language and sexual situations-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 49 minutes.

29,estebangonzalez10,One of the worst films of 2014,3,17 July 2014,"""We got played by the same guy... do you want vodka or tequila?""We got played once again with another familiar and clichéd romantic comedy with uninspired performances, weak direction, and poor writing. I guess Leslie Mann could have used some help from her husband, Judd Apatow, because the material she had to work with here was completely unfunny, or at least she should have asked him for advice before accepting to make this film. I'm sure she had a lot of fun making this, but I wish we could have at least had half the fun watching this as she did making it. She was really annoying, especially during the first half hour, and it's a shame because she is an extremely funny actress. I've seen Cameron Diaz playing similar roles before (for example in The Sweetest Thing which this film reminded me a lot of) so I wasn't as surprised with how uninspiring her performance was. Kate Upton looked great, but that is all she had to offer in a film where she felt completely lost playing alongside Diaz and Mann. As for Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, well he is much better as a Lannister. I really can't blame the actors because the material they had to work with was too cliché and their characters completely one dimensional. They were all stereotypes and their was no personality whatsoever to this comedy. The jokes are all recycled and there are very few funny moments. I wasn't expecting much from this film really, but I didn't think it would be as bad as it was.The Other Woman (or should I say, The Other Women) lacks substance and the funniest scenes for me were the ones borrowed from other comedies I'd seen in the past. I don't know why Hollywood producers think poop and vomit jokes need to be included in all comedies, but it needs to stop because they are not funny anymore. I'm all up for female empowerment, but this isn't really the way to go. This is easily one of the worst movies of the year and I should have avoided it. We have several contenders here for the Razzies and I forgot to mention how bad Nicki Minaj was in her supporting role here.",The Other Woman
30,pixrox1,"Toupee, or not toupee . . .",8,8 May 2014,". . . what a dilemma faced by the revenge-minded female threesome in THE OTHER WOMAN. Whether it is better that the philanderer suffer the slings and arrows of cruelly premature baldness, or lose all his ready cash; whether to take the low road to cheap comedy or the high road to a caper finale--that is the question. This flick toys with lots of bathroom-humored low-brow tricks to assail the serial cheater's manhood toward the middle of the film, but these generally fall flat. On the other hand, the ex-lovers' club members hit their stride during the trio's closing escapade in the Bahamas, when they attack their cad's wallet, rather than his hairline (or bust line). Anyone aware of the large number of American wives offing their spouses with anti-freeze tainted ""jello"" concoctions may not see the ""humor"" in the soap sabotage-in-a-public-place scene. Even man's best friend will lap up coolant from the driveway (and expire), but a guy must have a pretty poor sense of taste to chug a load meant for the dishwasher. Financial Come-Uppance, on the other hand, hits 'em where it really hurts. Turning his ""golden years"" into a twilight of dumpster diving for icky deposit cans & bottles to scrape together enough to finance a bean burrito sure beats 20 minutes of agony on a toilet.",The Other Woman

I found quite a lot of it wryly amusing. Leslie Mann had the most demanding role, her character being a bit neurotic and somewhat over the top. I don't recall having seen her in anything before. Cameron Diaz is still gorgeous, and an accomplished comedic actress. Kate Upton is apparently a model or something, and did just fine in a smaller part.

World of difference. Second, I enjoyed how the movie built up to the moment when the three women confronted and bested the cheating slimebag who had been manipulating them throughout. You do not get cheated out of your payoff, as they completely destroy him in that scene. However, the movie waited a long time to really show you if the husband was a sympathetic character or not. When they finally get to it, they of course have to show that he is totally evil so there is no doubt you want to see him dismantled. The movie is not interested in showing us the subtleties or shades of gray that an actual person would exhibit--they just want you to hate the guy like a terrorist so you can cheer his demise. When the three women do finally finish him off, his performance goes so far off the rails that you won't have any trouble remembering this is just a movie. At this point, the cheating husband behaves more like a supervillain from the Power Rangers. But I watched it back a couple times because it was so goofy. I like a lot of the roles I see Leslie Mann and Cameron Diaz taking lately, especially the ones where Cameron gets a little nasty. She's gotten really good at playing angry, badly behaved characters. I totally believe she has no sympathy for her opponents in films like Bad Teacher. So go watch that one next.",The Other Woman

It's after a romantic comedy, fashioned after those silly 30's and 40's films but with a bit of updating, mostly for language and some contemporary situations. Still, Diaz commands the screen and allows the other two actresses to have their moment in the spotlight.It's an interesting premise, as a lonely and misunderstood wife seeks the support and advice of the other woman. When these two join forces, it becomes more complicated because their common headache turns out to be a bigger rat than they expected, and if that wasn't enough, they are soon joined by another of his exploits. There's an interesting balance here, as Diaz projects sensuality and brains, the wronged wife is apparently a bit of business wizard but acts sillier than anyone else I have ever seen on the screen, and then there's the body, a sweet young woman who appears to have daddy issues. If this combo isn't enough, we have Nicky, playing a secretary with a bit of a sassy attitude.Eventually, everything is solved neatly, and all the girls get their men, have a happy ending, and the rat gets its day.

How can a woman be that attached to her husband's cheating partner?The comedy is a so-so. Diaz and Mann can act funny scenes well, Coaster- Waldau plays well as the 'target of revenge', but Kate Upton really did a horrible job. There's no real face expression worth shoot from her. Though for a point I agree to the opinion saying that Upton does fulfill the role of the physically better woman between the three woman.The execution is an okay job, though there's no new theme or epic scene offered by this movie.

Jokes aside, I'm a man and I must admit this movie's story is really interesting. From the moment Carly and Kate met each other on, the plot became very entertaining, due to the unpredictable situations the characters got into. Kate King is the typical wife, who albeit feeling extremely mad at the husband, still loves him and gets indecisive about the next step to take. Cameron Diaz's character, on the other hand, is that kind of woman that doesn't accept being fooled by a man, and does whatever is in her power to have some revenge. Both characters interact with each other and show the audience the neurosis that women face in relationships-- and maybe that's why it can be labeled as a ""chick movie"". The plot, of course, never tries to be too pretentious, once it admits to be just another Hollywood feel good kind of comedy.

They become friends and later they discover there is another woman, Amber (Kate Upton), he has been seeing. All these women become friends and vow to turn the tide on him that involve some unconventional things. (like what?) You don't want to know, but, some of them are funny. Wow! Kate Upton in a movie. Life if good. See, prayers do help. I may have to watch this several more times just to be sure I understand what the director was trying to say. (Say what?!!?) Kate, as Amber, is a breath of fresh air, so pretty with laughing eyes, and her smile is so infectious I couldn't take my eyes away. (You do realize there are two other pretty women in here: Cameron Diaz as Carly and Leslie Mann as Kate, right?) Who? I don't want to be unkind but I think too much make-up and, perhaps, some bad lighting affected some of the stars. No, not Kate Upton. Heavens, no.Kate Upton was the only reason I took this DVD out. Otherwise this can be considered a ditzy chick flick. What I saw before Kate Upton comes on the scene was a lot of overacting by Leslie Mann and some really unfunny, and annoying comedic skits, usually involving Leslie Mann as Kate. Some may blame the director for this. At times, I think the director thought he was directing a 3-Stooges movie (they were funny, this not so much) and he wasn't good at it. I will admit to some chuckles, at times, as there were some other funny things taking place. These times usually involved a huge Great Dane that Kate called a puppy. HA! A puppy indeed!I did enjoy the Mission Impossible music when Carly and Kate go on a mission to find out who the other woman is. Kate Upton, as Amber, appears on the beach (now, you're talking!) about half-way through and is an eye-candy filler so to speak. Hey, that's okay. But next time we need to see Kate Upton with more screen time.To sum up what you will see: bad acting, overacting (and not limited to Kate as Mark has a go at it, too, near the end), unfunny and annoying comedic skits, lame dialogues mostly in the beginning.

46,rzajac,Ditzy chick flick urban fairy tale,1,5 October 2014,"I can't remember the last time I marked a flick based on it's political correctness, but it feels like it's time to do it again. I think I'm ready to do this because of a somewhat recent dawning awareness that the key to the magic of film is its ability to weave a spell of myth. And the things I find repulsive about The Other Woman (TOW) are ultimately acting on the mythic level.Marketing types in the film biz went into full-bore development on this one; and what de rigueur elements were brought to bear for their target demographic? These are: Women as hot, sassy ditzes, regardless of their professional profiles; alcohol; affluence; the primacy of carnality and a meat-market sexual mentality.They pitched this salad to the suits, got the funds, and set the wheels in motion. It's interesting to watch the flick while keeping in mind how sad it is that the system can muster these kinds of incredible production values to make something which is, at heart, reprehensibly soul-sucking.I'm thinking of something Sarah Silverman said to Jerry Seinfeld: That an aging woman's all-consuming struggle to fight the onset of wrinkles is exactly WHY her daughters aren't dreaming of their futures. That's actually what's at the heart of the problem with TOW: A better example of a clearly articulated mythos designed to rob young ladies of hope could hardly be imagined.The final piece of the puzzle of the existence of flicks like TOW is the self-siphoning nature of that media market: Why do people (as J.R. ""Bob"" Dobbs said), ""Pay to know what they *really* think""?--especially when they're paying to be reminded yet-again to accept a status quo of women as venal, consumption-worshiping, walking man-servicing units.The writing is moderately artful, for what it is. Some people here are crowing about how gosh-darn *funny* TOW is; I suspect they're a little *too* easily pleased; happy to take their soul-poison with a spoonful of sugar; a modicum of the occasional witty turn of phrase, coupled with childish, over-the-top physical comic bits.",The Other Woman

Thinking he's simply being commitment-phobic.Imagine her surprise at meeting her boyfriend's cute-but-naïve redheaded wife (played by Leslie Mann)! Followed by the two of them meeting--and befriending--the buxom-yet-sensitive Kate Upton!I won't spoil the rest of the film for you, except to say that Ms. Mann practically steals the show with her character's ditziness.* And, Ms. Diaz still looks as good in a bikini as Ms. Upton! The latter is not just eye-candy, however. She's very articulate. And, Waldau is almost _too_ believable as the unfaithful con artist they now love to hate.Of course, I must confess that Ms. Diaz and Mr. Johnson are the only two names I recognized in the opening cast credits.

The significant others who are dragged to this outing will be pleasantly surprised at the genuine laughs that are offered. Try as she might, Diaz continues to be greatly limited in her cutesy-comedy performance, not unlike THE HOLIDAY; and although nobody else in particular is ""bad"" per se, it is definitely Coaster-Waldau who carries this picture the extra mile. Crude at times, and while there's not usually anything wrong with crudeness, one can't help but wonder if this movie's use of it is just to compensate for its many other imperfections.**½ (out of four)",The Other Woman
49,Christian_Dimartino,"When it's funny, it's pretty funny. When it isn't, well...",5,2 May 2014,"There is nothing wrong with a good girl revenge comedy every now and then. But when it's done, it needs to be done right. It needs to have the right script, and the right actresses for the leads. In the case of The Other Woman, only about half of that is true. While some of it is quite funny and the actresses are always delightful, the script takes some pretty dumb detours.Cameron Diaz plays Carly, a New York lawyer who seems to be in a happy relationship with a guy named Mark (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau). Mark is kind of mysterious, so one night, out of suspicion, she follows him to his house only to realize that he's married to a woman named Kate (the always delightful Leslie Mann). So, once they discover just who each other is, the two sort of form an alliance. But soon, they discover that there is yet ANOTHER woman. This one is named Amber (the unbelievably sexy Kate Upton), and once she discovers what Mark has been up to, the three women plan vengeance.Sure, it's a rip off of better girl-power movies, but that isn't the problem here. I laughed, a fair amount. The problem is that there are times during The Other Woman that are so excruciatingly bad that I as soon as the movie was over, I ran out of the theater in embarrassment. Embarrassment that I just spent money on it.Don't get me wrong: I had low expectations going in. I mainly saw it because I had money to blow. If I hadn't already seen Captain America: The Winter Soldier, I probably would've been in there instead. But I had no where else to go. Strangely, those excruciatingly awful moments don't involve Nicki Minaj, who makes her acting debut as Carly's assistant. Minaj is kind of a moron, but yet her presence is kind of funny. I can see her pursuing an acting career. The movie, I'm sad to say, needed more of her.The movie does work for about half the time, but that other half is pretty bad. The soundtrack, which includes Lorde's god awful ""Royals"", a remake of ""Love is a Battlefield"", and oh dear God, I just threw up. Never mind, I can't continue. Just know that nearly every song played is cliché and awful. Upton is mainly here to look good, so, mission accomplished. Diaz and Mann make a good comic team also.But then there are the times when the humor falls flat on its ass. The entire last half hour, honestly, is quite horrible. It takes a weirdly violent turn in the last ten minutes, in which Mark has a strange temper tantrum. It also feels like an eternity, especially during scenes like when Diaz pours laxatives into his drink. Guess where the scene goes. Unfortunately, that scene goes the same direction that the rest of the movie goes: down the toilet.C",The Other Woman
50,Shopaholic35,Completely hilarious if you can forget about your sense of reality.,10,20 April 2014,I really don't care how unrealistic or clichéd this movie is because I loved it. It was absolutely hilarious and stayed true to it's chick flick roots.Leslie Mann deserves major credit because she is incredibly talented and carried a lot of the movie. Don't get me wrong I also enjoyed Cameron Diaz & Kate Upton's performances but Leslie is in a comedy league of her own. So incredibly impressed was I with the movie that I was even able to alter my personal feelings about Cameron Diaz (I don't know what it is but she annoys me).Be prepared to throw your expectations and sense of reality out of the window for this film.

You'll enjoy it, despite the occasional lack of humor, but also forget it as soon as it's over. Actually, this is more than you might expect from a contemporary mainstream movie.What surprises me is the praise of Kate Upton's display of talent. Actually, her lines have been trimmed to a necessary minimum which turned out to be the right measure. Otherwise she sure is young and well endowed but this also where her ""hotness"" ends. We'll see how she develops both physically and as an actress. Until then throughout the movie Cameron Diaz and emaciated Leslie Mann showed much more sex appeal. As a side note, i'm not sure who convinced Leslie Mann to lose weight to this extent.Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau delivers a fine performance and was the right choice for the alpha male of the movie.",The Other Woman

She is so into him and even decided to be exclusive, well as exclusive as she can be. After he cancels on a date, she decides to surprise him and makes an unplanned visit to his home. There, to her surprise she discovers his wife and his whole secret personal. This movie is funny, and it reminds you nothing worse than a scorn woman. The mistress, the wife, and another discovered mistress plan a plot to get even and make this two time cheat learn his lesson. Nicki Minaj makes an appearance as the assistant to Carly, but her biggest asset is her round figure.

53,ArchonCinemaReviews,"Surprisingly uncliche and methodical, funny too",7,8 January 2015,"The term 'chick flick' was thought up for the express purpose of describing the film The Other Woman, but it's not as bad as it seems.As a genre, I hate chick flicks. I hate their frivolity, I hate their sexist opinions of what is funny to women and I hate the obligatory character trait that every lead has: the romance starved desire to find a man. Maybe screenwriter Melissa Stacks feels the same way, because The Other Woman really does not have any of these clichés.Carly, played by Cameron Diaz, is a New York City lawyer and self sufficient woman. She meets a seemingly wonderful man Mark, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, and a whirlwind romance ensues. Hoping to surprise him at his house, she unexpectedly shows up to find his wife Kate, Leslie Mann, at the door. Kate's happy Connecticut housewife life is turned upside down by the discovery of the affair and she turns to Carly for emotional support, advice and maybe a little retribution.Mann plays the typical crazy archetype similar to the majority of her previous roles. At times it is distracting, excessive and desperately in need of being reigned in. Diaz is the definitive star of the film (this coming from someone who is not typically a fan of her acting). Her character is strong, independent, and no nonsense which plays wonderfully against Mann's neurosis.Given the premise within The Other Woman, the comedy easily could've been the most deplorable systematic cliché of a film. Instead, writer Stacks and director Nick Cassavetes refreshingly allow the women to join forces against the scuzzball philanderer rather than cattily and vindictively gun for his affection.Cassavetes is a veteran director in the film industry and it shows with the minute details within the film. The Connecticut housewife drives a Volvo and wears brightly colored Tory Burch attire, lamenting of her potential Norwalk destination as a future divorcée. The entirety of The Other Woman is peppered with moments like these, some explicitly touched upon and others left for subconscious effect.The film loses its spark in the third act promptly after introduction of the final mistress, played by Kate Upton. She is a minor character with very little lines but her novice acting is a glaring diversion from the rest of the tone of The Other Woman. At this point the movie turns into a generic and formulaic rom-com, neither notable or remarkable, and it lost my attention.The Other Woman is a comedy geared toward women but is funny, even for those females that don't expect it to be. Even though it loses steam substantially in its final third it should be a fun one-time watch.For more of all the reviews of the recent releases, in full, please check out our website.",The Other Woman

Leslie Mann is a comedy genius and is at her best here as the insecure wife who finds out that her husband is enjoying affairs. Cameron Diaz is very good as a woman who finds out that she's one of his mistresses.The reason I'm not giving it a 10 is that the first several minutes are bad. The opening song is so bad that it's painful to listen to. What looks like it's going to be a sex scene turns out not to happen. The first conversations (between the man and Diaz's character and between him and his wife) are boring.Don't let the bad start put you off - it gets really good as soon as the wife and Diaz's character meet.,The Other Woman

59,trublu215,The first truly awful film of 2014.,1,9 May 2014,"The Other Woman plays at the same pace of a turkey cooking on Thanksgiving...and you have front and center seats to watch every painful second of it. The latest film from Nick Cassevettes is an absolute dud, and another failure to mark down for Cameron Diaz. This is hands down the worst film of 2014 so far. The comedy is bland and under-cooked, the performances are terrible (aside from the always perfect Leslie Mann), and the story overall can't find its footing. We spend the first twenty minutes of this film seeing Cameron Diaz waltz around like the baddest bitch alive then only to succumb to being apart of the supporting cast once Leslie Mann's character is introduced. So not only do we have a character in Diaz that is relatively unlikable, we also spend the next half hour of the film getting used to Leslie Mann's presence as she takes over the screen as the lead. This is surprising to see especially because it was marketed as a ""Cameron Diaz"" movie. While she is in the film just as much as Leslie Mann, she has no character development and no driving force by the hour mark. The supporting cast, which includes the likes of Kate Upton, Nicki Minaj and Don Johnson isn't any better. Kate Upton's character maybe has fifteen minutes of screen time all together, and what a useless fifteen minutes it turns out to be. Nicki Minaj is even more horrid than imagined, not being able to say one line without sounding like she is reading off of cue cards and Don Johnson is, well, Don Johnson. Cassevettes has made some brilliant films over the course of his career such as Alpha Dog and She's So Lovely and I am a HUGE fan of his work, which is why I gave this movie a chance. But, in all honesty, he really missed the mark on this one and he has nobody to blame but himself, which is unfortunate because we all know the type of talent that this man is capable of. Overall, The Other Woman is a horrid excuse for a film and I can't really recommend this film to anybody. It marks the first film of 2014 to actually make me angry for, not only paying for it, but willingly sitting through it.",The Other Woman
60,D_Burke,"""The Other Woman"" Needs To Just Dump The Guy Already",4,26 April 2014,"""The Other Woman"" is a harmless film, but I think that's part of its problem. When a wife befriends her husband's well-intentioned and equally duped paramour, and teams up with her to exact revenge on him for philandering, it would help if the story had a little more bite to it.The film has a few laughs, but its main problem lies in its consistent meandering around a solvable problem. The story inserts forced slapstick that has Leslie Mann & Cameron Diaz (mostly Mann) literally falling over themselves in a seemingly desperate attempt to add more time to this movie.Anyone who has seen the preview for ""The Other Woman"" knows the story. Cameron Diaz is a lawyer who has the problems that every professional woman has in a Lifetime movie: she works too hard, she has a sassy secretary (Nikki Minaj) who tells her that to beleaguer that point for exposition's sake, and she's finally found the ""perfect man"" in Mark (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau).After dating Mark for months, she decides to surprise him by arriving at his house in an outfit that will most definitely draw men to theaters. It comes as a surprise to no one that his wife Kate (Leslie Mann) answers the door, but I suppose you have to have something to get a plot like this going.While the two points in the love triangle meeting isn't supposed to be a surprise except to these two women, there are supposed to be other spontaneous moments in the movie. Unfortunately, the movie lacks any truly unpredictable ones.That problem is not entirely the fault of the screenwriter, relative newcomer Melissa Stack. I think the movie would have been a more refreshing surprise if the marketers had left the cheating man's third girlfriend, the voluptuous, too-good-to-be-true beach bunny Amber (Kate Upton), out of the advertising campaign entirely. I guess they thought Cameron Diaz wasn't enough of a reason to draw in male audience members, which makes me feel bad for her actually.Truth be told, there is nothing wrong with Upton's acting in this movie. Granted she isn't given a lot to do, but she's believable enough when given dialogue.As for Diaz, she can be funny, and has proved herself in other comedies (""There Something About Mary"" (1998), ""Being John Malkovich"" (1999)) to be more than just a pin-up girl. I thought she tried too hard to be funny and edgy simultaneously in ""Bad Teacher"" (2011), but the $100 million that movie ultimately made may have proved me wrong.Leslie Mann has more solid comedy credentials, as demonstrated in her husband Judd Apatow's films. In ""The Other Woman"", the scenes where she gets drunk with Diaz seem too desperate to echo her much more enlightened, and funnier, scene in ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" (2005).It also seemed as if both Diaz & Mann were told by someone on the set, ""When the laughs get low, run into something or just fall down."" In 9 out of 10 scenes when either or both of them fell into something or out of somewhere, the sad trombone (wah wah waaaahhhh . . .) would have fit too conveniently.However, the ways in which the three women exact revenge on Mark revealed the film's lack of originality. There are several ways, all of which audiences have seen in other movies, and most of which are brought up in one scene, and dropped in the next.Seeing Mann put hair loss formula into her on-screen husband's shampoo bottle leads to one comic moment that is dropped entirely for the rest of the movie, like Daffy Duck getting shot in the face by Elmer Fudd. The difference between Daffy being fine in the next scene and Mark still having perfect hair is that ""The Other Woman"" is not a cartoon.If you've seen ""9 To 5"" (1980), ""She-Devil"" (1990), ""The First Wives Club"" (1996), or even the remake of ""The Longest Yard"" (2005), you'll already know the methods of downfall these scorned women bring to Mark. The only difference is that in the previously-mentioned films, the methods were actually permanent.The final climax that leads to Mark's downfall is one you knew was coming anyway. The story's meandering and stalling makes you wonder why Mann's character just doesn't go up to her husband and say, ""I want a divorce"".It would help even more if Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau didn't make Mark such a bland character, making the audience neither feel the pain of his women's furies nor hate him for being a jerk. He just looks like a J. Crew model with the personality of the paper on which that model is printed.If he was given a personality the same way Mann, Diaz, & Upton were, it would have been a better movie. It would have been a classic if these three likable women actually sat down and watched movies of similar formulas, then thought it better to exact their revenge in other ways.",The Other Woman
61,ghost_dog86,Absolutely Misogynistic!,1,26 April 2014,"Not starring Natalie Portman, ""The Other Woman"", sloppily directed by Nick Cassavetes and shockingly written by a woman (I'll get to why this is so shocking in a minute) is a comedy meant to make men look bad, but in the process makes women look substantially worse.Synopsis: Mark King, played by Nickolaj Coaster-Waldau, is a millionaire middle-aged scumbag with a full time job, a wife and numerous mistresses (who all refer to themselves as his girlfriend). Leslie Mann plays his wife, Kate Upton plays his girlfriend and Cameron Diaz plays his other girlfriend, or the same character she plays in every movie; the seductress who eventually proves that despite her slutty exterior, she is smarter than any man. When these women find out about each other, they team up to get revenge. While the premise is what it is (not bad, but more so harmless ""John Tucker Must Die"" fluff) if you haven't spotted the problem with the plot, then allow me to enlighten you: Mark has a full time job and a wife and a bunch of girlfriends. Aside from him having to be a master of time management, the fact that women who called themselves his girlfriends don't seem to have any clue that the 24 hours allotted to him daily is being divided between multiple women, and simply accept the fact that they don't hear from him for days or weeks at a time as if this is some sort of normal dating practice, is a massive plot hole which dooms this film from act one.That said, as if the only one who understands how bad this material actually is, Mann attempts to inject some of her unique improvisational slapstick into as many sequences as possible. But sadly, after a while her efforts come off as aggressively desperate; if anything making us all feel bad that she is putting on a brave face while standing on a sinking ship.Final Thought: Even though every beat of this plot is also in the trailer, even though every time Nicki Minaj spoke (she plays Diaz' secretary) it made me want to kill myself and even though this contains an odd amount of misplaced fecal humor and an ending which logistically made zero sense, there is one deplorable truth here which is absolutely unforgivable. ""The Other Woman"" is misogynistic. Every female character in this movie is one dimensional and totally defined by a man. Mann's character is a housewife who lives for her cheating husband and can't seem to find any meaning to her existence outside of holding the title of his wife. Upton's character is the quintessential large breasted bimbo who needs a man/father figure for ""guidance"". Even Diaz's character, the most independent of the three, must consult with her father and a man that she's never met before (but who has dreamy eyes) about how to handle her plans for revenge. Screenwriter Melissa Stack should be ashamed of herself for essentially saying: Women cannot survive without men, and furthermore must join forces to even be on the same intellectual level as a man. And for those of you who enjoyed ""The Other Woman"" enough to want to see more material like it, you should be ashamed of yourselves too.",The Other Woman

63,Bruce722,Great female comedy.,8,26 January 2015,"The Other Woman is hands down the best ""female style"" comedy I've ever seen. Cameron Diaz is essentially the lead character in the film but Leslie Mann carries the film from a humor standpoint. Her nonsensical style is a delight and never gets boring or aggravating. Diaz's character has the bulk of the depth and she delivers as needed while Kate Upton provides the stereotypical ditzy blonde with big boobs but does so while maintaining a sort of sweet and innocently stupid charisma. Honestly, my only real negatives with the film were the decision to cast Nicki Minaj as a sort of comedic relief character and the underutilization of Upton's character. Minaj annoys you every brief moment she's on screen and Upton often times feels out of place; almost as if she was thrown on screen simply as eye candy, even though the film's target audience is women. Nonetheless, this is a surprisingly great movie that most women (and I think plenty of men) will enjoy.",The Other Woman

Not young women, unless they think Manaj with that freak body is inspiring. Young men would view more senior snatch than desired and older men want to see only rake thin nubile hotties. So how'd they do the bait and switch here and for whom? Only ONE scene in the film intrigued me, and that was the Bahama coastline, just soft, languid and lovely. But what do they do to enhance the beauty? Crank up the extreme cackle of a henpecked trio with no discernible dialogue. Sigh...a friend of mine highly recommended this film, have to rethink that alignment, dementia has surely set in deep.First Wives Club actually achieved the female empowerment MO while this film degrades women to cartoon characters. Maybe Diaz forgot this was a real film in 3D? She sure was sublime in Shrek! I think the final cut involved many decisions about appearing too revengeful and to prevent some ideas flowing for scorned viewers.

The film is about what happens after discovering her boyfriend is married, Carly soon meets the wife he's been cheating on. And when yet another affair is discovered, all three women team up to plot mutual revenge on the three-timing SOB. The movie does achieve it's goal but not that much I mean it's not that funny.

I rarely ever find that comedy film where I'm just laughing my butt off throughout the picture and I was expecting this to make laugh real hard a couple of times but it only did three out of five. The story is not that interesting though,if a male such as myself was about to watch this they would not be invested in the story,characters or situation presented here. The performances are very mediocre from the cast,Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann try to muster what they can but they just come off as not too good but not bad either. Kate Upton was pretty good though I mean she plays the dumb hot double d blonde and I honestly thought she pulled it off quite nicely. The direction is not that good,why in fact the director of this film is actually the director of one of my favorite romance movies of all time The Notebook and since this is his latest he's really hit the barrel of crap. The worst thing is that this movie talks about nothing,it's a chick flick and one of the most UN-enjoyable ones I've ever seen.

And when yet another love affair is discovered, all three women team up to plot revenge.Director Nick Cassavets, well known for The Notebook and She's So Lovely successfully step aside to make way for a purely entertaining and popular movie purpose. Hollywood knows how to make a good comedy. It's impressive how the machinery is so well- oiled. Indeed, the recipe is simple: a plot looking like the headline of a summer magazine article (Can we be friend with our husband mistress?) and a touch of girl power (Make him suffer!!!!). Added to this Cameron Diaz and you got a pure comedy product made in Hollywood. It's efficient. Moreover, Leslie Mann is brilliant in the part of the desperate housewife betrayed by her husband and close to a nervous breakdown. She gave us some anthological and very funny scenes though. She managed to prove once again that she is one of the most underrated weapon in American comedies. Plus, Leslie Mann and Cameron Diaz have a great chemistry in the movie, but Kate Upton is definitely the stereotypical third wheel in this trio. And we literally have a scene telling us that. They gather around a table for breakfast and decide to make the guy suffer as much as he did; ""I'm the lawyer, you're the wife, and we'll find out what she's good at..."" The problem is that this movie is trying to be more than just a comedy, carrying a message of female empowerment. This film is begin women to go and watch it. But it's trying to hard to empowered woman so that all they're doing throughout the entire movie is talking about MEN! So this concept of empowering women is just a giant lie.

And I'm sure that nobody could blame me.She was really, really, really bad here. Her character, her lines, her appearance, and, most of all, - her acting. Just terrible. Annoying to the point of nausea. I wanted to turn the movie off several times just because Leslie Mann was downright unbearable to watch. If the idea was for her antics to be funny, it failed miserably.The other women? Not much better...Cameron Diaz looked terrible. She is not a bad actress in general, but here... urgh. Not funny, not cute, can't pass for a tough career woman. I don't know what she was supposed to be, but she didn't pull it off.Kate Upton... oh, dear! The worst actress ever. A chubby bimbo with bad hair. I think she should get some hair extensions and stick to posing nude for lads' mags (since her acting is painful to watch).And that butt-ugly transgender monstrosity with her inflated backside - Nicki Minaj - don't get me started on that. Why was she cast, seriously? And the guy? Zero charisma, below-average looking, permanently dumb look on his face, lame haircut. Who'd fall for him? Well, at least there were a few funny moments in the movie, I must say. Very few for a comedy, though. I think the diarrhoea scene alone was worth it. That's the main reason I'm giving it 4 (instead of 1) stars. That was a good one.Oh, and I really liked the Great Dane - a beautiful animal, although I missed the point entirely. Other than s****ing on Cameron Diaz's apartment floor, the dog served no purpose and just randomly tagged along throughout the movie.Anyway, I guess there's no harm in watching this movie, but don't expect anything remotely impressive - it's not that good.",The Other Woman
69,MUFCOK,Better than I expected,7,7 July 2015,"I remember seeing the trailer of this movie at the cinema last year and commenting on how awful it looked 'another mainstream Hollywood comedy flop'. I'm unsure on what inspired me to watch this on Sky Movies, the genre is not my usual choice and the style of humour and plot isn't something that jumps out at me. Nevertheless, I gave it a go and surprisingly I am quite glad I did as I was pleasantly surprised with The Other Woman.The plot is very simple, as is usually the case with movies of this nature. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau plays multi- millionaire Mark King, a clichéd womanizing, materialistic, cheater who has 3 women on the go at once. Leslie Mann plays his wife, she is ditsy, clumsy and more of a family woman that the other two. Cameron Diaz plays his girlfriend, she is a high flying business woman who is a similar match to Mark King and Kate Upton plays the younger, model looking girlfriend. The three women are created well with each one offering something different that Mark King would want. The three women find out about his cheating but rather than take it out on each other they come together to get their ultimate revenge on their cheating partner, developing a friendship along the way.The highlight of the Other Woman is Leslie Mann's performance;, she easily gives the performance of the movie. Her character is the most likable of the three and she made it very easy to connect with this character, much more convincingly than the other two actresses. Leslie Mann and Cameron Diaz share the most screen time, their chemistry is believable and often amusing. Kate Upton has very little screen time as she isn't introduced to the movie until around half way though, she feels more like a third wheel to the other two women as she doesn't share the close friendship.These movies are always predictable, suffering from cliché after cliché and The Other Woman is no different there. It is highly unrealistic, how could a woman who has just discovered that her husband is a cheating rat, be that calm? The script is average to poor, and all characters apart from Leslie Mann seem to have several negative features. The lead male character should be sophisticated and suave but he is far from that, he is boring offering no laughs and it isn't that believable that he should have women fighting over him. Cameron Diaz' character is wooden and overly stereotypical and Kate Upton is there merely for her appearance, her one line based tiny script cannot save her, her acting is woeful. Leslie Mann carries this movie with her fantastic performance; the supporting cast really let her down.The women meet as strangers and finish as best friends, yes it is clichéd and predictable but it is still done with a refreshing look. This isn't a rom-com; it's a film about friendship and getting their deserved revenge together.Despite the predictable plot and questionable characters I still enjoyed this movie! Don't judge me, I am aware that as a movie, it is far from perfect but strangely I actually enjoyed it, I know I shouldn't! This is probably because I expected those faults and much more to be honest, plot holes and hollow characters are common in chick-flicks. However the film did make me laugh on multiple occasions and it was just the film necessary after a few beers on a Sunday afternoon.7/10",The Other Woman

The only couple of bright spots in this clichéd mess was seeing Don Johnson again – but he deserved better than this mess - and Taylor Kinney is fine to look at, but neither of these guys had anything to work with in this film. It is, in all honesty, weary, dreary and predictable. I think what I was most unhappy with was they took one of the best songs ever released to start this picture, Etta James singing A Sunday Kind Of Love, and I could not as it turned out, in my wildest imagination picture a worst waste of a fabulous musical number than inserting it into this drivel.

71,kekca,My rating: 7,7,18 September 2014,"Some might say it was not interesting, or that is a female, but I think the film ranks on fun shortly after The Hangover trilogy and adds a serene touch in our daily lives. The amazing Cameron Diaz in the company of a bunch of beautiful friends, views, places, cars and cadres... balsam for the eyes.In the form of revenge, although it was kind of gentle lesson, it was shown (literally, too bloody compared to above said) to the ""macho"" (the opposite of hussy woman) who was oblivious, living in his impossible world. Lessons are - there is justice in the world, be good, optimistic and believe in true love. Here I will open brackets (hardly for the first time until now), sharing the insight that sooner or later the miracle happens, no matter who you friends are, who your love is, etc., as it is happening to you it means that would be nice and you deserve it.A female comedy as not common among the thousands of titles on the big screen.

So, for the first half hour or so, I was wondering when the laughs would start. Yes, there were a few smiles but nothing to make you wish you'd sat nearer to the toilet!Businessman, Mark King (Danish actor, Nicolaj Coaster-Waldau)is what you might call 'a busy lad' when it comes to the ladies and, even though he has what appears to be a very happy and satisfying (sexually) marriage to Kate (Leslie Mann), he also has a torrid affair going on with Carly (Cameron Diaz) who doesn't even know he's married. (If she had known, she wouldn't have been with him even though she enjoys a good romp!)I guess it was when Amber (Kate Upton) shows up at his Bahamian business getaway that things started to get funnier and then, once all three girls were committed to the task at hand - serving Mark up with everything he deserved - the laughs really started flowing.It's not the sort of film you can write any sort of lengthy, detailed review about other than to tell readers to go and see it. For me, the most enjoyable scene in the whole film was when Mark is ushered into his office by his assistant, Lydia (Nicki Minaj) and all three ladies are sitting in line! That was classic cinema only surpassed when Mark's business associate joins the party and mark realises he's well and truly stuffed! I just loved the line about all three girls having a nice Bahamian suntan!Not Oscar material but a fun movies nonetheless. But shouldn't the title be ""The Other Women""?",The Other Woman

77,ahegde3149,Such a waste of time,2,12 December 2014,"There was not a scene in this film that made laugh out loud. Maybe a small giggle about 3-4 times apart from that this in no way is a good comedy. Despite having a good cast, it falls flat with bad script and poor characterization. The jokes it tries to deliver are bland and the story is far too predictable. The movie involves an adulterer Mark (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau of Game of Thromes fame) who cheats not 1 or 2 but 3 girls Kate(Leslie Mann), Carly(Cameron Diaz) and Amber(Kate Upton). While Kate is Mark's wife whom he cheats for Carly. When both of them get to know Mark's secret they both team up to take him down. While our womanizer unaware that they both know the secret seems to have another woman in his life which is Amber. The earlier two had been following Mark also take Amber into their secret and now on the ultimate mission to teach the s.o.b. Mark a good lesson. It seems Mark is not only cheating on the girls but seem to have invested fake money in the name of his wife Kate. Now there is also Nicki Minaj who plays some secretary at Carly's office was simply unwatchable with an annoying accent.Kate Upton also bored with her acting but the viewers were kept distracted by her body. She simply runs on a beach in a bikini for no reason and that's pretty much her role in the movie. Cameron Diaz was nothing special and Leslie Mann tries too hard to play this crazy-insecure wife. Nikolaj was my favorite actor among the lot, but he is portrayed as one of the worst person giving a damn about anyone in his life. There was not a single funny dialogue or scene which I remember. All it tries to be is a feel-good movie about 3 girls who become BFFs. There is also some toilet-humor forced onto like dog cgi- pooping in apartment, man shitting his pants, if you find that all funny then good this is the movie for you. But for me it is easily in the bad-worst movie region of the year.RATING:[1/5]",The Other Woman

79,The_moan_of_all_moans,Go away Minaj and take your fake ass with you.,2,28 April 2014,"To be perfectly blunt, if you have seen the trailer then you have seen the film. Unfortunately it is simple as that. All the ""highlights"" are shown, the story is spelled out for you, and as it blatantly screams ""girl power"" then you know who will come out on top. These feminist superiority films are all the same so if you have seen one then you have seen them all. And like the majority of them, this film is awful, just awful. As i said you see 90% of the ""comedy"" it has to offer in the trailer. The rest is just painfully packed with prolonged conversations and embarrassing attempts to make the audience laugh. There is one scene that made me sink in my seat, as it was clearly meant to be a scene where the audience laugh and continue to do so the more ridiculous it gets (see Wolf on Wall Street; cerebral palsy scene). Although that was its inept intention, it fell as flat as Cameron Diaz's acting ability. I like Leslie Mann, but that squawk she does can only be tolerated in small doses. In this film, that squawk is so prominent, i considered suicide. As for the one with the big...smile, well i predict her career will be determined on how much she is willing to show her....versatility, because she is forgettable in this film. Ironically the only person that is worth mentioning is the sleaze-ball himself Mark King (Nikolaj Coaster Waldau). He, unlike anyone else in the film, actually showed more than one dimension to his acting. He was like a 3d cube in a game of Pacman; surrounded by things that like to put balls in their mouth. Speaking of balls.....there is the unforgivable casting of Nicki Minaj. Did they photo shop out the peg that was on her nose? Because that voice cannot be real. It was like Janice from Friends had snorted helium. Yet another singer who has invaded movies using their stature rather than acting skill to get the part; it is criminal.This film might make woman stand up, united and say stupid things like ""you go girl"", but that feminist front aside, this is a horrible film, where ironically a man is the star of the show.2/10 for the Playa.",The Other Woman
80,GTeixeira,"Unsurprisingly weak, but at times unbearable",3,26 July 2014,"Lawyer Carly Whitten (Cameron Diaz) ends up discovering her seemingly-perfect boyfriend is married; yet, she ends up forming a strange friendship with the wife, Kate (Leslie Mann). As they find out and end joined by yet another affair, Amber (Kate Upton), the unlikely trio plot a revenge against the cheater while also uncovering his many lies.A very silly sitcom-styled comedy, which tried to sell itself through its stars (Diaz, Mann and Upton), but that's it. It offers nothing special, nothing that hasn't been done thousands of time again and again; even worse, it does all that badly. The movie picks up a bit towards the end, but only barely.The characters are awful. Mann's is irritating and even obnoxious at times, and terribly inconsistent at all others, which her terrible ('quirky') delivery and overacting makes almost unbearable; meanwhile, Diaz is always overly cold and bored-looking, completely flat in her delivery. In special, their early interactions (with Diaz reciting her lines rather than acting and Mann overdoing hers) are particularly bad.The entire first hour or so is terrible, a 1 rating, but not only thanks to them. Nothing interesting happens; whichever amusing situations Cassavetes/Stack attempted end up ridiculous by not only the fact we have seen it all done before, but also because these are situations usually geared towards teen characters. Seeing Mann and Diaz in their scene at Diaz's apartment is cringe-worthy.On the other hand, Kate Upton is incredible to look at, which is already a great addition, and while quite amateurish she has a cuteness that make her likable; she does the ditzy blonde stereotype quite well, though from what I've seen of her she seems to be a bit like that in real life too. The movie picks up a bit after she arrives and the group band together to get back at the guy, with some of the revenge bits being quite amusing but, even then, nothing memorable.A little corporate-scamming plot is added near the end; just a weak attempt to make the movie appear a little more 'serious' (i.e.: pretentious). Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, who plays the cheating guy, is good, as is Don Johnson in what little screen time he has. There are a few chuckle-worthy moments, but no real 'laugh out loud' ones, to the point they end up falling back on bathroom/poop jokes to elicit a reaction.Overall, 'The Other Woman' is just another typical chick-flick comedy, the kind you go to see already knowing it will be a silly pastime and far from memorable. But then again, this kind of film has its intended audience; I'm just not part of it.",The Other Woman

There are not a lot of surprises, characters being developed, fun moments, heartfelt moments, etc. They are just ""okay"". I actually think it would have been better had it been rated R, then they could've gone for more of the jokes, and wouldn't of had to dub out the few lines that they did, which was bad. I like all of the actors fine, and appreciate Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau from ""Game of Thrones"", just not enough for them to aspire here to unfortunately.

There's nothing you could get from this besides seeing angry desperate women doing revenge on a cheating husband/boyfriend. Unfunny jokes, cliché drama and predictable storyline become a routine and repeating all over the film. The idea itself is quite interesting which unfortunately isn't executed well and Nick Cassavetes fails to give soul and chemistry from each character. Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann seems trying hard to liven up Carly and Kate's character but horrible and childish script just waste their talent to improve more. Overall ""The Other Woman"" is a mess and watching it was completely waste of time, the only reason I could stand seeing this film until the end was Kate Upton.

An extreme chick flick!",7,10 February 2021,"The latest in a series of 'women getting even with their chauvinistic boss, husband who dumped them, or cheating husband' films. A number of reviews mention the likeness of this film to ""The First Wives Club"", of 18 years previous to this film. Again, there are 3 women who band together to get revenge against badly behaving men. But I didn't happen to see any reviews that mentioned it's likeness to the the grandmother of these types of films: 1980's ""9 to 5"". Again , we had 3 women who banded together to punish a man behaving badly toward them. In that case, it was their chauvinistic boss. In the present film, it is a cheating husband. For much of the film, it's knockout girlfriend Cameron Diaz and beautiful wife Leslie Mann as an unlikely 40sh buddy pair. Eventually, they are joined by newest girlfriend: 20sh beautiful Kate Upton, who takes the place of Dolly Parson, in ""9 to 5"", in the sense of one notable physical asset, although she hardly takes her place as a personality. Nice skimpy diaper-like bikini she initially wears. ............I noticed that, of these 3 films, '9 to 5"" has the highest mean reviewer rating, although the fewest reviews(probably because it is much older), while the present film has the lowest mean reviewer rating, but the most reviews. I agree that ""9 to 5"" is the best of the 3, with a memorable theme song and a constructive last part, on the part of the women. From my rather brief scanning of the written reviews, each of these films has probably a sizable majority of 8,9, and especially 10 ratings, and many of the 7s said they loved it. On the other hand, there were also quite a few 1s and 2s for the present film, and ""The First Wives Club"" film. In contrast, there was only the occasional 1 or 2 rating for ""9 to 5"", thus explaining it's higher mean reviewer rating. In regard to the present film, clearly, the vast majority either loved it or hated it, with few such as me, in the middle. I would love to know the sex ratios of those who gave it a 1 or 2, vs. Of those who gave it a 8, 9, or 10! Despite being a man, I fall in the middle group, with a more qualified opinion than the most enthusiastic writers. I hope some other men also fall into this or the upper category........... Some object to the excesses the women went to to punish the cheating man. But, at least they are more imaginative than conking him with a frying pan, or arranging for his imminent death. I will say that I don't think of myself as a male chauvinist, I haven't dumped my wife for a younger model (But perhaps that's only because my only wife is 21 years younger than I?), and I haven't cheated on my wife of 32 years.(Thus, I must be a rather dull fellow, eh?). Thus, I can laugh at abuse heaped on these stereotypes without feeling guilty............. Addendum : The dialogue between Leslie and Cameron or by Leslie, when she was hyperexcited, was often unintelligible to me.Why didn't Mark lose all his hair from using that shampoo doctored with hair remover? That would have been spectacular! ........... The most interesting moment for me is when Mark entered a room, not expecting to see his wife and 2 mistresses together, acting as a team in condemning him, and ready to sentence him. The door was locked behind him, so he couldn't escape. The subsequent events are much the most spectacular in the film!",The Other Woman

86,thomas-w15,I think I laughed once in the entire film.,2,22 November 2014,"The Other Woman 2.5/10- Almost all romantic comedies tend to be poorly made films with no plot of any kind other than the common clichés that plague the genre. Even with Leslie Mann giving an above-average performance while carrying all of the comedy in the film, The Other Woman is no exception. Aside from the scenes of Kate Upton on the beach, Leslie Mann is really the only enjoyable part of the film. Anyone who saw the film would agree that Leslie Mann is the only person in the film that has any talent for comedy. Yes, Cameron Diaz has some funny moments in this picture, but those are really only because Leslie Mann is in those scenes and is forced to carry the scene. I do not know if this is entirely fair because Leslie Mann is definitely given the best role, but still good comedic actors always find a way to be funny regardless of what role they are cast in.The plot is nothing to talk about as I said earlier. This film really does not try to differentiate itself from the probably 15 romantic comedies of the past year. There are a few subtle changes that is at least creative and definitely show potential, but with poor execution and lack of funny actors, this movie adds nothing to the genre. I knew coming into this movie that the acting was going to be sub-par, so I guess in a way I was not really disappointed. Cameron Diaz honestly does not do as good of a job as she usually does, and honestly seems like she is not even trying. As I have repeatedly said before, Leslie Mann gives one of her better performances of her career and I applaud her for giving her best effort. Kate Upton did not really need to add a whole lot of depth to her character since she just had to play the hottest woman in the world. This part she did very well, but I would advise her not to try for a big acting career in her future. Nikolaj Coaster- Waldau, I am really sorry to say because he is amazing in Game of Thrones, but does not have a gift for comedy. All of the jokes he did no one really laughed at in the theater so if you love Game of Thrones, you should not see The Other Woman. There are not many other aspects to this film to discuss. I would not say anyone is disappointed after seeing this movie because we all knew what we were walking into.

87,manxman-1,Witless mess that is kept afloat by the hardworking cast,2,13 May 2014,"Lesley Mann is always a delight as an actress and she battles it out as a betrayed wife in this tasteless piece of dreck aimed at the feminist audience. Cameron Diaz, looking like a stick insect put together with silicone and play dough, scorched with a blowtorch and bleached to distraction, goofballs her way through the story with a manic charm and perseverance that is more than this vile, untalented script deserves. One wants to weep at the depths to which screen writing has sunk when a witless piece of garbage like this that depends on vomit and diarrhea jokes for its laughs -- and judging by reading other postings -- succeeds in entertaining the female viewers. By all means let's see a movie about wives and mistresses taking revenge on an unfaithful mate but let's see it done with wit and style, not with unpleasant bodily functions and scenes in which the man develops breasts due to being unknowingly plied with female hormone pills. (Would a movie in which a man slips male hormone pills to a woman be funny if she developed balls and a beard? Maybe in America, nowhere else.) What a HUGE condemnation on the taste -- or lack of it -- that permeates Hollywood today. The fact that audiences have applauded this movie only indicates the depths to which film-making has sunk. That this script was greenlit at all is saddening beyond belief. Mars and Jupiter are planets other than Earth, and the fact that this movie has attained the success it has makes one wonder what planet the viewer who applauds this dreck is from. Where is the wit? Where is the intelligence? Is lavatory humor the wave of the future? Yes, there are movies around that have scatological humor in them and yes, they were written by men, but they succeed because they have solid wit and smarts behind them. The Other Woman has a basic idea that rapidly descends into the gutter and chooses not to raise its head again. For all the battles that women have had to be accepted as individuals in their own right, this movie hurls them right back down into the pit. I would love to see Lesley Mann, Cameron Diaz et al in a movie about women taking revenge on an unfaithful mate (see the 1959 Alain Delon movie Women Are Weak or the 1968 Three In The Attic for tips on how to write such a movie) but The Other Woman is a tasteless stinker of a movie that fails to understand how scriptwriting works. Obviously the only thing that matters in Hollywood today is the box-office count and the fact that this movie has scored big can only be attributed to the pull of its stars, who deserve one hell of a lot better.

They carry on their affair for awhile until Carly realizes Mark is married to the ditzy Kate and he lives in Connecticut with her and their Great Dane. Carly stops seeing Mark immediately and for some unknown reason Kate starts stalking Carly wanting to be her friend. Then they both find out that Mark is also seeing another woman named Amber. Long story short, the three decide to make him pay. Yawn. It might have been funny if it wasn't so poorly done. None of the 3 women seem to work (even Carly the lawyer) but have plenty of money to spend weekends at the Hamptons, the Bahamas, etc.I think the actresses needed a paycheck and the movie theatres need to fill up their numerous seats because I can't understand how this drivel was even made.

There is an expression that has worked its way into the psyche of the American public, which is that we (as the American people) are being ""dumbed down"" by the movies currently being put out by Hollywood. This movie is dumber than Jim Carrey's movie, ""Dumb and Dumber"". The lead actress is absolutely abysmal in her comedic talent and the writers are truly bad to have created such a typical, ""dumbed down"" comedy, that had nothing clever, nothing really funny except perhaps one scene where Cameron Diaz thinks she has been hit in the face by a dog's balls (wow that took a lot of original thinking to come up with that).

I'll give you a hint it's not Mark and it's not the ""house keeper"" either! Yes, it's his wife Kate (Leslie Mann).Kate feels betrayed by Mark and wants revenge, but wants Carly's help. Not until Kate finds out that Mark has a second girl friend Amber played by Kate Upton, that Carly agrees to help Kate.So if two girls friend weren't bad enough a third must be the extent of Mark's mistress mischief right? Wrong! it get even weirder, more bizarrely diabolical and then the revenge part actually starts.THE OTHER WOMAN is like a modern day 9 to 5 (Dolly Parton movie) on overtime. Yes it's true this is most definitely a chick flick with strong over tones of insane farce, Much of the story line straddles the borderline of what some women may have experienced in ""the dating world"" coupled with outlandish situations that could not possibly occur in real life to anyone.Full review and MORE reviews at: HollywoodJunket.com",The Other Woman
94,matic-boh1,A clichéd and weak vengeance comedy,4,11 July 2014,"As one would expect, The Other Woman is a typical revenge comedy that is based on a somewhat predictable plot, one that sees three women joining forces to find vengeance against a disloyal and unfaithful man, which creates a film that fails to produce any particularly amusing moments. Although the film clearly aims to emphasize the notion of female empowerment, it comes across as nothing more than straightforward comedy that focuses on clichéd vengeful ideas and schemes. Leslie Mann is definitely a bright spot and her performance does elevate the film in some respects, as she provides a wonderful addition of physical humor. However, The Other Woman has few positive features, as the film is far too long, while also being dominated by a simplistic storyline and poorly developed characters that desperately lack depth.",The Other Woman
95,michael-sengwah,Hilarious yet Ridiculous,6,6 May 2014,"It definitely does not serve as a serious film but the ridiculous story and funny moments provide general audiences an enjoying, hilarious and relaxing cinematic experience. While it is a film for female, the story on women seeking revenge on a playful man through different kinds of tricks shows that the screenwriter does not take any efforts on seeking fresh ideas. However, the chemistry between Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann, especially the surprise performance from the latter have actually more than enough to leave audiences with laughters long after the show, but it is a bit of let down when the film chooses to narrate the ending using words rather than visual.",The Other Woman
96,Clockwork-Avacado,"The Lawyer, The Wife and The Boobs",7,25 April 2014,"Cameron Diaz is back in comedy, after her amazing turn in last year's ""The Counselor"", in which she finally nailed a solid, challenging dramatic performance. Now that she's back in the home territory, she would, one assumes, be able to do what she's been doing so well for almost twenty years. ""The Other Woman"" is really a two-header, between Diaz and Leslie Mann, as a standard straight-laced/ridiculous combination in the Laurell and Hardy vein, as two women unknowingly in love with the same man; Mann is his wife, Diaz is his casual fling, although she doesn't know it yet. When things finally come out, Kate's(Mann) world collapses, and she clings to Carly (Diaz) for help, and eventually, revenge. What neither of them are aware of, though, is that husband Mark, is his infidelity is pathological, and that Mark, far from being the desirable lover, is a worrying villain, who not only cheats in love, but is planning to cheat millions of dollars out of various businesses. Can the Lawyer, the Wife and The Boobs defeat his evil schemes in time? Actually, Nick Cassavettes new film is delightfully un-pretentious in its' presentation of good, relatively clean fun. Whilst this is not one of the most outstandingly memorable comedies you'll ever see in your life, it is an appealing, aesthetically pleasing 109 minutes of frothy, silly entertainment. It isn't all Biblical moping about, or CGI dominated video game super hero movies. It's a film about people - simple, bizarre comic archetypes, in a relatively competent script, that is just sufficiently lacking in structure to be fun, without being aimless. It's not especially laugh-out loud funny, again, but it mixes slapstick sequences, with sharp wit, and cringe-worthy monologues, courtesy of Leslie Mann, who is hilarious, and yet at times, so embarrassing it is hard to watch. But this is, thankfully, all in character - she plays a hopelessly devoted, and hopelessly stupid wife, whose enthusiasm is both cute and more importantly, the driving force behind the entire plot more or less. Feminists may criticise this character, as indeed they have, but without her, none of this film could have happened. And also; it's a comedy for god's sake. Of course she's silly. She's meant to be. This isn't a statement about what all women are like, the same way that Mark is not meant to represent an archetypal man. Grotesque stereotypes are what fuel all the best comedies, and this is no exception.The balance between the three female leads is at times, uneven - Mann gets most of the gags, Diaz is playing essentially an exasperated ""Straight Woman"" to her incessant stream of breakdowns, and Upton plays perhaps an even more offensive stereotype (very well) of the dumb, sexy blonde. Whilst she isn't the best actress in the world, Upton's character actually has a lot of potential, which isn't quite fully exploited, when you finally get over the fact that you enjoyed the film better when it was just Diaz and Mann.There are a few moments of rock-bottom crudity, which, depending on your tastes, will make or break the movie for you. Some work, and some don't, but on the whole, it is a love song to female friendships, about the importance of having friends you can rely on...over having a single meaningful relationship. Yes, it is a little cock-eyed, I'll grant you, but, allowing for the situation these characters are in, its' about the most positive message to be derived from the action. Mark is totally without redeeming features, which is a good thing in these days of moral apathy, and a light comedy is a strange place to find such a well defined sense of moral aesthetic, but at the end of the day, it is rather a ""Sisters doing it for themselves"" kind of film. And Mark is a worthy adversary for their curiously puerile revenge, which soon blossoms into something far more effective - A point a lot of critics who have criticised the film's ""lack of realism"", seem to have missed out on.Their final revenge is definitely satisfying, although there are moments were the momentum rather sags, not soon after Kate Upton is introduced. This isn't Upton's fault - she actually has some of the best lines(""She's not a whore - She's just a slut""), but there's no denying the film's finest moments are the horribly awkward ""Let's be friends"" chemistry between Diaz and Mann. However, the resolution is quite complex, and very well worked out - only, it's not exactly set up very well - although there's no denying that it is an effective climax. However, the final shots - freeze frames detailing the fates of each one of the three ""Other Women"", seems rather ill-conceived, and a more fully realised ending may have been nice, especially as it makes the rather perfunctory romantic sub-plots seem even more perfunctory. But then I suppose in a film about ""Women Together"", the idea of romantic fulfilment may see rather old-fashioned.On the whole, then, Cameron Diaz is on cracking form, and may well be reaching a new pinnacle in her career, although its' more than likely that this will go down in history as a decent enough movie, not a classic.(Like ""The Holiday"")But Diaz seems even more comfortable at this age, sharper, funnier and more measured in her performances. Mann essentially makes 75% of the comedy in the film, and a nice sexy cameo from Nicki Minaj as Diaz's self-serving, empowered PA is a nice bonus- but it really doesn't make or break - she's on screen for maybe 4 and a half minutes in all. But, this is a piece of fun, and, in a rather turgid climate of grossly over-rated mainstream garbage, it's definitely an entertaining way to spend an afternoon.",The Other Woman
97,QueerVamp20,Fabulous - Fun - Funny - Fantastic,7,26 July 2016,"I really had no idea what this movie was going to be like. I came across it at F.Y.E. It caught my eye and I read what it was about - Looked like a good movie to watch with my grandmother. Cameron Diaz is great in this movie. But so are the other two women. Cameron Diaz discovers her boyfriend is not being truthful. An Unlikely friendship begins with someone close to her boyfriend. But trust me, Cameron doesn't want to be friends at first. Lies, betrayal and deceit play a major role in this movie. But revenge and karma can be a pain. Join Cameron and two other women who team up to get back at a scumbag. You will laugh and you may even cry - but either way you will love this movie (Warning: Movie may not be suitable for men who can't stand chick flicks).",The Other Woman
98,iraz,Amazingly unfunny!!!,3,15 July 2014,"No matter how much talent is in front of the camera, if the writing is not up to par there's trouble ahead. That about sums up ""The Other Woman"", which is a mess of a film and makes the almost two hours feel like at least ten hours.It is just not funny and is filled with implausible situations that try your patience. Of course, if those situations resulting in humor and ""ha ha"" funny, you just go with it, but there's nothing worse than a unfunny ""funny"" picture. Leslie Mann is a talented actress but is wasted here along with Cameron Diaz. I kept waiting for those funny moments I read about in other reviews. Well the film ended and I'm still waiting!",The Other Woman
99,bland-kevin67,Madeline Kahn Lives Again!,8,6 June 2015,"Leslie Mann! I must say that the trio of women really made this film. I am not much of a Diaz fan but she had me laughing a bit in the first parts of meeting Mann. This movie works on the improbable scenario where a man's wife meets and plots with his two mistresses who weren't aware that they were messing with a married man. Upton just shines on the screen as the youngest of the three. I thought the plot was a lot like another movie ""John Carter Must Die"" Still, this was pulled off with a bit of class. The actor from Game Of Thrones did a great job as Mark. His accent pours out sometimes but he is convincing. I guess I was not too crazy about watching this because it is definitely a Girlie Movie, but I was drawn in by Leslie Mann! She reminds me of the late Madeline Kahn who could crack me up with just an expression. Of course some of the scenes were played over the top but a few of them. I even kinda like Minaj in her bit part as Diaz' assistant. I would recommend this movie to a friend. Don't expect any profundity from it and just go with the flow. It always cracks me up how Hollywood depicts cheating men when the industry thrives upon infidelity.",The Other Woman
100,EmmaNelly,Hit or miss movie,6,19 April 2014,"I went into this movie expecting to laugh and not take it seriously. I laughed but ten was annoyed by the underlying problems in this movie. SPOILERS BELOW- Basically you'll walk out thinking the women are stupid and the men are mostly dogs. This is not a movie that makes sense- Would a wife really do what Leslie Mann's character did and become buddies with the other women (arrange dates for her husband, drug him, play ""rock,paper,scissors"" to see who'll have sex with him, visit the mistress at her home and get drunk with her)?, Would a husband NEVER call his wife on his trips to check in?, Could a lawyer never appear to be working or in court with clients yet take vacation randomly to the Bahamas and even randomly pop up in Connecticut? Why would a secretary dress like Nicki Minaj? Who uses GPS and binoculars to follow a cheat everywhere? Why would the mistress hook up with your brother? Why would Don Johnson end up marrying the young model and playing the dog of a father who later randomly punches the cheater on the street?The young model played a silly bimbo with her only features being her boobs and great body. Nicki Minaj's behind was accented in every one of her scenes as if that's all she brought to the movie. Leslie Mann plays the same role now in everything... Annoying, crazy, idiotic. Cameron - blah. She's too old for these silly girlfriend roles. I'd love to see her stretched as an actress. Overall- just go in to laugh and don't try to make sense of this movie and you may find it funny and enjoyable.",The Other Woman
101,TheMovieVlog,I did laugh a few times..,5,16 April 2014,"Not sure what I expected, but this movie was funny yet completely unremarkable. While I did laugh a few times, all that I really came out of this one with was a realization that Kate Upton fills a role that is completely defined by her body...having no acting ability apparently wasn't an issue when casting. Also, Leslie Mann has certainly typecast herself in a role, as she seems to have played the same person in every movie that I've seen her in. The laughs were too few and far between for me to think that I enjoyed it...but judging from the noises in the rest of the theater, the women in attendance seemed to get a real kick out of it.",The Other Woman
102,siebertws13,The Movie that Made Cameron Diaz Quit Acting,1,4 January 2018,"Terrible ripoff of ""The First Wives Club"" concept, wasting a pair of talented comediennes.

103,kr98664,Is Leslie Mann's Real-Life Marriage on the Rocks?,3,14 May 2014,"It's not my fault, I swear. As a citizen of the United States, I don't have to take personal responsibility for anything, thank you very much. Yet somehow, I found myself furiously tapping my watch, willing it to go faster so this movie would just reach the end. My main mistake, and I'm still actively trying to find somebody other than me to blame, was to think the presence of the delightful Leslie Mann indicated a pleasant cinematic experience was at hand. She has teamed up with hubby Judd Apatow and made some very funny movies. Now in my boundless ignorance, not having read all the details of cast and crew, I thought Mr. Apatow was also involved with this movie. Turns out I was wrong. Not only did he have no association with this movie, but his marriage to Leslie must be on the rocks. It's the only logical explanation. Otherwise, they'd have casually talked about her involvement in this project, he'd at least have looked over the script with professional curiosity, and then lovingly warned her it was a dud. There must be something seriously wrong in their household and it breaks my heart to think of the effect this will have on their kids. The basic premise had promise, but that's it. The laughs were few and far between. The theater was eerily silent most of the time, meaning nobody else had any trouble containing their laughter, either. Maybe this was supposed to be a light-hearted drama, erroneously packaged as a comedy, but if so, it was still flat and lifeless. Was it a chick-flick, and as a male, I was outside the target audience? If that's the case, you certainly don't feature a bikini-clad Kate Upton jogging on the beach. Besides, my beloved wife, whose opinion I respect highly and is most certainly of the feminine persuasion, disliked this movie as much as I did. My unsolicited advice? Skip it. And hope Leslie and Judd work things out so they can go back to looking out for each other again.",The Other Woman
104,marykshaw-20799,Silly and strong,10,24 May 2019,"Great laughs and a great concept. Too often the cuckold lashes out at the equally ignorant mistress. It's refreshing to see the women band together and form such a strong bond. The villain really is a super-creep too, so you don't really form a bond to him. Cameron Diaz is strong and plays the alpha well, which I found surprising. Leslie Mann is perfection, per usual. The only bad part of the movie is Nicki Minaj but her part is extremely small. Overall, a fun way to spend a few hours and a great message for women who are afraid to leave a bad relationship. There is life after heartbreak!",The Other Woman
105,cyclerrollie,When Men Cheat,10,12 May 2014,"When men cheat, what happens in this movie usually doesn't happen, but it did for these three ladies, and it makes for an enjoyable watch. The plot isn't filled with holes, and there are a lot of laughs, especially out of what Kate Upton says because she's really only known for the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Editions and therefore starts off playing a bit of a ditz, sort of like Leslie Mann's character, who is the insecure one of the group that's tricked into signing papers for her husband's company that she's the CEO of.Enjoy this film with friends. It's the perfect buddy comedy even though the cast is largely female and men aren't really a big part of it at all. It'll be part of Cameron Diaz's best of collection in the coming years.",The Other Woman

There are # of problems with this Cassevetes film: - Leslie King is not a great actress; - the predictable script does a poor job of its portrayal of women; - the much-vaunted humor is largely based on gender stereotypes; - the writer Melissa Stack takes a number of gratuitous and stereotypical swipes at Canadians (e.g. ""the ugly Canadian"".How did the casting crew convince Cameron Diaz to star in this forgettable film?

108,bobbystryker,A perfect example of a good idea poorly executed as Hollywood spoon feeds us yet another forgettable chick flick!!! Read our review for more!,3,20 April 2014,"I've probably mentioned this before, I don't mind seeing a chick flick once in a while!!! Not at all! In fact they can be unusually relaxing after a tense week. Notting Hill, Love Actually, Hitch, Sophie's Revenge and South Korea's My Sassy Girl are just a few faves that come to mind. I even own all seasons of Sex and The City and Gossip Girl on DVD! I think that gives me enough chick flick street cred to say I know what I'm talking about when I say this is a pretty rubbish movie!That's right, this ranks up there amongst crappiness such as Mel Gibson's What Women Want – how could he not know that they don't want to see him prancing around, stereotyping and insulting women everywhere? Okay, perhaps The Other Woman is not quite that bad but it's pretty bad.The premise is simple enough. Kate King (Leslie Mann) realizes her husband, Mark King (the accomplished Danish actor Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau of Headhunters and Game of Thrones fame – with a darn good American accent), has been cheating on her with Cameron Diaz. Rather than go ballistic on Diaz's butt, Kate goes to Diaz for solace and the two eventually realize there is even a third woman in the picture. The ladies join forces to seek revenge.When I put it like that, it sounds like it could be a pretty funny and amusing movie. Unfortunately the execution and generic performances fail to live up to the potential. There are so many funny things they could do but don't, so many missed opportunities, that I found myself feeling more and more frustrated as the movie went on.The friendship between Mann and Diaz feels fake and contrived right from the get go and Kate Upton is essentially a token character as the third woman who adds absolutely nothing to what's going on.There are only a handful of funny moments which really don't save this movie from failing miserably. The only redeeming moment is something that reportedly happened off screen. Upton was reportedly very anxious and self conscious about her beach running scene, but Diaz and Mann are so awesome in real life that they went out there on the beach, leaving their lunch breaks, to run by her side and give her the moral support she needed. Unfortunately, the on screen shenanigans are nowhere near as awesome.I'm sad to say this is a movie you should all try to avoid. A by the numbers chick flick which probably only serves to given Diaz and Mann some extra pocket money for their next shopping spree.Avoid..Rating 3 out of 10FOR THIS AND OTHER REVIEWS CHECK OUT MAXIMUMEXTREME.NET",The Other Woman

The plot seems to pander to the lowest common denominator and the humor is childish and immature.

The other characters were fine though (well acted), and even one of them with the most common sense with breaking away from the cheating husband as soon as she found out about his wife. But.. the wife? No. They try to make us feel sorry for this woman but really we kinda see why the husband would have started cheating on her. She's annoying (and creepy due to following one of the mistresses to her apartment) to the point you want her to shut up and let the other women talk! And to be honest? The wife just reminds me of the other wife Debbie in This is 40 (same actress). No differences. Same annoying talk.",The Other Woman
111,carollaw51-41-56256,Dreadful,1,4 February 2020,"I expected a lot more from this film as it sounded like it could be fun especially with Cameron Diaz starring in it.I usually like her films.
To start with the film looked promising at first' a naive woman dating a man who is a serial cheater.She finds him out when she decides to turn up at his house hoping to give him a nice surprise but instead is greeted by a woman at the door who tells him she is his wife.
Okay so far so good but then suddenly the film takes a drastic turn for the worse.
The wife Kate turns up at Carly(Cameron Diaz) work place and starts to act over emotional causing a spectacle of herself.This is i believe supposed to be a funny scene but instead is so over the top and to say over acted would be an understatement .At this point it looks like Cameron Diaz was desperately trying to save the film as she is still giving a realistic performance.
But the film gets worse as the next scene is when the wife Kate goes out for a heart to heart drink with Carly only to get legless and again act well over the top.The Kate character is so annoying and irritating that it becomes of no surprise that the husband was cheating on her.The actress plays the character with far too much over confidence that you feel like you are being forced into finding her character funny.And i for one did not.And her painfully thin figure was painful to see.I saw other reviews that criticized the Amber character of being too chubby Really? i know whose figure i would prefer to have.Hollywood anything under a size 8 is not attractive.
I could go on about this film but what is the point its cliched in girl power and not in a good way.
Towards the end of the film the cheating husband Mark walks into a glass room that literally shatters all over the place.How is this even possible ?wouldnt this glass have been health and safety checked so that this wasnt possible.
If you are into over the top acted cliche comedies then this may be for you otherwise avoid like i wished i had",The Other Woman
112,superwomanproductions,If You Liked The First Wives Club...,10,16 May 2014,"This was a hilarious movie of revenge and consequences. One thing we know for a fact is that there are a lot of women who have been cheated on, and there are a lot of women who have unknowingly been the other woman. As women, we're told not to blame the other woman for the affair, but instead the blame should be placed on the married man, because, after all, he knew what he was doing the entire time. ""The Other Woman"" is a lot of women's fantasy on film; a depiction of women getting together to get back at the cheating, lying man in their lives, who brought them heartache due to his selfishness and deceit. ""The Other Woman"" is cleverly written, has a lot of relatable humor and shows that out of the heartbreak that comes from cheating, not only can their be vindication, but a friendship can develop between women due to that unfortunate, yet common bond. Cameron Diaz was the funniest I think she's been since ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""The Other Woman"" if worth going to see if you want to laugh out loud. This is the best 'wife revenge' movie since the ""First Wives Club"". So if you liked ""The First Wives Club"", you will love ""The Other Woman""!",The Other Woman
113,gottfriedsv,This is very silly...,4,27 May 2016,"Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau not able to repair the plot. I not support cheating... but I think real cheaters only laugh at the moments of this film. Why? Let me to introduce the character of our Gold Lion: Mark King (name describe the character trope) Mark King is a business man... decent, tall, handsome, shrewd and looks-like a romantic-film type man by always wearing full business or using the rolled up shirt style. He is DEFINITELY not cautious or overthinking. Mark King's flaw is not over-cheating but his insane foolery. Mark cheating his wife with two women. This is a fair set, I believe harmed, abused or bullied woman may enjoy his downfall as a temporary cure to their problems. Mark works as a regular man, maybe low-cunning in the script, but he is dumb. He types different woman on his ******** account, lie to travel to golf or a business trip. (typical American cliché): Mark however had maybe two chance to redeem himself, but all may be ended in bittersweet. If he told, that the papers for the illegal companies signed by his wife, then the wife surely hates him, even Mark told him, that it made for their wealth. No way for the previous events... - Mark is an evil man... boastful females can look down the people by that fictional or real character's attitude. Their hateful arrogance in that way is shredding the mind. BUT, if Mark stick on his wife side and when he failed to broke the law, his wife may excuse him and she can visit him in the prison! It also been a somewhat downer ending. - Mark cheating even Kate Upton's meaningless character. He is a ""playboy"" man with ""playboy"" attitudes and desires: More cars, more women and more wealth. I feel sorry to Leslie Mann's character, she is trapped.In fact the characters of Nikolaj-Coaster, Cameron Diaz, Leslie Mann, Kate Upton and all are meaningless ones are paper-thin and without depths. I not give it to a 1/10 rating, because the core of the plot is logical. A skin-deep man cheated his wife three times, also protect himself bad falsehood... like golf match, business trips or incoming calls from co-workers. He provided his position by signing the papers with his wife. Sorry Leslie Mann... your character is dumb too... I even realized it now. SHE definitely not read the papers or speak about this? A fool, a blinded fool. When they in a serious situation (several times) a woman speaks about something and the other two around him begin the natter. This makes the film non-serious! Right... Mark and Leslie Mann's character are in the dead end, because of the plot, somehow for the law of ugly-trashy enjoyment the redhead will become the main protagonist. In a logical film, Mark should be taken to prison by broke the law and Leslie Mann will require some intelligence uplift, because her dizziness and dumbness caused her downfall, even if she able to create business ideas. Her kind nature are irrelevant now. Cameron Diaz... healthy in appearance and bad in acting. Seriously, she feels herself old... the film even jokes it, as he always compare herself the youth in an uncomfortable way. Her character is a fake-lawyer architecture woman, by the way fake-lawyers also go the prison? What about that line of story? All people just ignore her? (LET'S CALL HER LAWYER FURTHERMORE) OK right? He is easily deceived by a cheater, while she not met the wife. Where she taken her degree? She is blind? She should have suspect it by somehow, if the film motivations and other background things were made it properly. Kate Upton is believable than a lawyer, even a fool (but maybe richer) man can deceive a naive youngster. Return to the lawyer. She is a maniac! INSTEAD OF TELL THE POLICE about situation, he begins to plot a CHILDISH revenge in an Adam Sandler level. And when the another no- name wife's brother tell him some advice, she replies: Leave your silly man logic... MAN LOGIC? Tarnation... that character is awful, she spits the eye of the reasonable! The revenge plot and the all other party scene with the sun-burnt terrace is simply awful. Man logic... people should know, that in the cover of the no-depths of the lawyer, there are hidden personality with the disdain of different people. A greedy, satanic, envious, avenger and boastful personality. For the rule of why not, she befriending the naive, kind, dumb, needy and silly-smart wife. The end of the film with that old man is lame and awful. Kate Upton's character is only for fan service. She only served as a third cheated person. Her ""jokes"" not improved the film. The ""punishment"" is maybe funny for those, who grown up with Adam Sandler, but in real life they are desperate and childish. The office scene is wrong, even it has a potential, where even Mark's boss invited by the women, but this scene ended with Adam Sandler jokes. Right... the end is Euphoria ending, everything is happy except Mark, enemy is out and the princess saved. Beautiful? Only for the fools! Logical? No! I can tell an alternate version: - Mark cheated his wife, wife and the lawyer take this to the court. They deal with the economic end of the problem (in the film it is done, even it is sketchy and we not see, how they do it CORRECTLY) and Mark went to prison, without burlesque- themed wall fails and life-dangerous pranks, however no one can proof that... maybe except that a skilled one begins to investigate, they surely gets on caught. But please... they are adult people, adults do not needed to act like stupid peasant women from the 9th century.Overall: 4/10 - Jaime/Nikolaj is a fine actor, even in this nothing-role - Leslie Mann is likable, even with her serious flaws.The others are nothing in this film, sorry.",The Other Woman

Involuntarily alter his body by overdosing his drinks with female hormones.Dilute his shampoo with hair removing cream, causing him to lose his hair.Flush his toothbrush in the toilet...Pour dangerous amounts of laxative into his drink at a restaurant.Have a drag queen sexually assault him without consent.All the while, the women are portrayed as strong supportive characters, with a cringey slow-motion beach shot where they all hold each other as if to say 'yeah girl power! we're all in this cruel vendetta until the end!'.After the slew of assaults upon his person, they climax by confronting him, causing him to have a nervous breakdown, and they literally stand around watching as he breaks his nose and then trips into a glass pane that shatters and cuts him up. They literally just stand there watching. Nobody offers to check if he's okay or call an ambulance. I guess that's okay because he's a man.The worse thing about this movie is that it is NOT a good portrayal of women, and there is something seriously wrong with society if we do find this funny.",The Other Woman

Kate Upton well the reasons her acting sucked less, 1 she had a very small role and 2 its hard to concentrate on her acting while the screen time. Story was plain dull, jokes were very over hyped with least funny punch lines. and for Nick Cassavetes how do you go from directing John Q, Alpha Dogs and my sisters keeper( though with this one they had a very touching story to begin with and a very good cast) to directing this. Was Tyler Perry a consultant on the movie? I recently saw game of thrones and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau was very decent in it, but this s**t.

Even more tristesse can be found in the picture drawn of these three awkward ""girlfriends"" on ""exchange principle"" (I give you stupidity and you give me your idiocy in return): acting-out of narcissistic huff on basis of Freudian hysteria. It would be better to read a psychiatry in-patient-report instead. Who really seeks some sort of possible solution to one's own inner unpredictabilities - especially regarding adultery and other themes alike - will be disappointed big time here. And what could ""good old"" revenge-garbage like this produce other than lecherous feelings of petty satisfaction for people without any self-esteem at all (like the three brainless girls shown here)? So Adorno was right: these three miniature-versions of kinky witches become themselves what they allegedly most hate by means of their own dirty deeds. Meticulously how they get off on their torturing of the one they apparently once ""loved"" - without, of course, realizing how they expose their own inner garbage dumps by doing so. Because by intentionally trying to damage the person they claim to having ""once loved"", the three chicks just proof that they not only have got no brains at all (just see what they are babbling about all the time), but rather that they are people without morals and totally unable to love somebody in general. What a sorry state of culture that excretes such a film, even showing diarrhea as some sort of entertainment in more than one scene.

Some reviewer are giving low scores because of no depth of characters, plot holes etc etc, but come on - did you really expect that from this kind of movie? This (kind of-) movie is like a simple action movie, you must not expect too much realism, it is simply made for making you laugh. I know I did.Thankfully, this movie is not so much about revenge which has been so many times, but rather about the development of the odd friendship between the ladies and their conspiracy towards the man in the film, Mark, played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau.Cameron Diaz is actually rather good in her role, and her character Carly's way of dealing with the situation is quite refreshing (trying to just walk away).

The script is a mess: if you are writing a film about a wronged wife exacting revenge on her cheating husband, don't make the wife so irritating that you'd be sympathetic if he buried her alive in the back yard. The hilarity of a character being sick in her 'bag and a large dog defecating in a pristine flat is limited to those under 6 (which seems to cover most of the positive reviews judging by the grammar and spelling). What was Cameron Diaz thinking? What was the director thinking? I can only assume (in both cases) the motivation came from the pay cheque. I'm sorry, but this film is drivel. I can't really imagine who it's aimed at, but anyone who did enjoy this is probably not bright enough to be in charge of a blender.We lasted half an hour before hitting the eject button.

123,karenlim89,A vapid and underwhelming shell of a movie,2,26 October 2014,"I never had high hopes for this movie but I didn't expect to be so sorely disappointed either. Considering that this movie centered around some form of female empowerment and was mainly about not letting a philandering man get away with adultery, the movie reeked of a shallow plot and an even worse script. I can overlook the uncommon nature of 3 women bonding over an unusual shared circumstance -- they're all in love with 1 man who's been cheating on all of them (he's married to 1 and the other 2 are his mistresses) — because hey, it DOES happen in real life, but what was highly unbelievable was that these 3 women became best friends almost overnight and became somehow, impossibly, connected on some deep spiritual level by just getting drunk together and plotting revenge on the same target. I use the term 'impossible' and 'unbelievable' because there was almost no believable character development to speak of. Sure, the spotlight was on Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann but the great injustice was that their characters had little to no substance. What constituted their characters' personalities in the movie were clichéd and ultimately, revolved around the cheating man. I mean, if you're going to make a movie about female empowerment, it might help to give their characters a little depth in areas of their lives where the man is not necessarily involved.Worse still was how they included Kate Upton's character in the movie without ever really including her. Watch the movie and you'll get what I mean about her prop-like status. I find this to be somewhat outrageous because even in a female-centric movie like this where Kate Upton played one of the 3 scorned women, she was reduced to standing by the sidelines and was only given attention when her bosom and/or butt was needed to fill a scene.One of the biggest disappointments of the year. Struggled to even finish this and found myself frowning throughout the entire ordeal.",The Other Woman

The scenes that are completely hilarious are when Kate is putting estrogen pills in her husband's smoothies while Carly has put laxative powder in his drink. Taylor Kinney as Kate's brother Phil is so hot in this movie that any girl or woman even would just swoon when he's on the screen.

I was shocked and horrified and as a result we talked about this movie for a couple of hours after-wards, I'm sure that we were not the only couple that walked away from this movie to then have an argument.The reason for my upset was first and foremost that if there was a movie made with three men, who decided to (even talk to each other after finding out that the woman they were involved with had been sleeping with them all) team up to destroy a woman who, yes is potentially a bitch in her business endeavors as well as being a cheating whore. would then proceed to take the bitch out but destroying her ability to have children, taking all her money from her and then to have her thrown through glass and have a broken nose, well need I say more. There would be uproar at such an evil movie. Yet I read here how funny it was! Seriously the plot was flawed and obvious, the main characters didn't seem to have to work and got to go to many locations and get drink (nice) Basically it was a mess of a story and I feel ashamed that I sat through the whole thing.Diaz, your days are sadly over, I remember being in my teens watching her in the Mask and falling in love, since that time she has seeming carved herself out as a power woman and it doesn't matter if she is a bitch or a saint, she wins! In The Counsellor she was the royal bitch who took everyone out, yet she won and it was somehow okay.

137,marshagentry,The Other Woman Isn't Always a Mistress,8,2 August 2014,"I have seen Cameron Diaz in comedies where she wasn't funny at all. She was adorable in ""There's Something about Mary,"" but I thought she was UN-FUNNY and obnoxious in the movie where she trades places with Kate Winslet during the holidays. That movie was a loser, especially for Cameron. I believe that she did what the director asked her to do. Her acting made me uncomfortable.I mention this because I was so happy with her performance in The Other Woman. She didn't laugh or cry or act melodramatic in inappropriate moments. She was appropriate for her character, but very charming. Leslie Mann is the actress who does some over-acting, or her part is written so that she is hysterical a good part of the time, but she does this rather well. I'd read that Kate Upton wasn't all that great in this flick but this was a perfect movie for her. She is a beauty with a pleasing charm.THIS IS A SMALL SPOILER. I'M NOT GIVING AWAY MUCH OF THE PLOT. I'M DESCRIBING THE REACTION THAT EACH WOMAN HAS WHEN THEY FIND OUT THEY'RE DATING A CHEATER. I believe that all this is evident in the previews. The previews often give away half the plot anyway, but the part that I describe is evident during the first third of the movie.Let's get to the good part of this review. This movie is about three woman who realize that they're all with the same cheating man. That is the premise of the movie. Leslie Mann plays the wife. This is what I love about the story: There is no competition whatsoever between women. I was able to love Cameron Diaz' part because she isn't willing to be the other woman. She isn't willing to beat out the wife. The same is true of Kate Upton's character. These women make some clarifications about the woman ""mistress."" You can't be a mistress if you don't know that the man has a wife. If you pull yourself out of the situation when you find out, you are not a mistress. I like this definition.I think this is a movie more suited for women viewers because I could revel in the good feelings of loyalty that these women had as friends under duress. Cameron Diaz plays a career woman who also knows how to attract men. She has a balanced life. She's a successful single woman who has scruples. She is still disappointed in men, or at least, this man.Leslie Mann's character is dingy, but she isn't stupid. She's emotional, and she plays a funny drunk. She is not quick to hate ""the other woman."" Because these women don't hate each other, I can have fun watching this movie. I can enjoy the relationship that these women create as they deal with this cheating man.Kate Upton doesn't have a huge part; her character isn't super developed but this isn't necessary. A third woman is needed in this story to show that this man is a cheater all the way. He'll cheat on the wife. He'll cheat on his hot intelligent girlfriend. He'll even cheat on the even hotter, younger girlfriend.Another big plus for women viewers is Taylor Kinney who is mostly known for the TV show Chicago Fire. But I'd never seen him. He's a nice surprise as the brother to Leslie Mann's character.This isn't a perfect movie. Its a very good comedy. I didn't give it a 9 or a 10 because it isn't When Harry Met Sally or The Princess Bride, my favorite comedies that I've watched many many times.One more thing: There is some gross humor that doesn't work for me (even though I loved Bridesmaids, one of the tackiest movies ever, but I didn't like all of Bridemaids' tacky gross stuff either). I hate the term ""chick flick."" This movie would be fun for women to watch together. Because most of the actors in the movie are women, I'd say that women will prefer this movie. Here's a newsflash: I have no desire to watch a movie with men only. Men enjoy watching other heroic men doing heroic things. We don't call their movies ""men flicks,"" or something similar that's a vague put-down.The Other Woman is fun and sweet. The financial transactions in the story weren't clear to me, and perhaps twenty minutes of nothing happening could have been shaved off the movie. But this movie is cute. The main characters are moral; they take the high ground under duress. I enjoy the distinction made between strong moral women who like to let their hair down and have a good time and weak desperate women who don't mind breaking up families or stepping on anyone to get their man.The moral code in this craziness is refreshing.",The Other Woman

139,helsinki027,Cameron should be above this,2,5 February 2015,"Some people here have a problem with this movie's premise itself - that the two heroines would ever become friends. Me, I see nothing wrong with this set-up: Cameron is tough, Leslie is needy, they were both lied to by the same guy, so it doesn't seem impossible that they should actually find themselves feeling ""united against the same enemy"".The beginning was decent. I have little to object to in most of this movie's first half. While none of it is fresh/original (literally everything can be found in earlier movies), it's not too hackneyed either, and compellingly acted by both female leads.The second half, however, is a mess. Juvenility sets in: potty jokes, bad dialogue, poor interaction, useless new characters. Don Johnson is scenery, Leslie's hot brother is too hot and young for Cameron (ten years her junior). Kate Upton well, her appearance simply takes 40 IQ-points out of this movie's intelligence.But being moderately impressed by the first half, I kept hoping that it'd still get better by finale, that maybe Melissa Stack stacked the deck in order to impress us in the end, and there's an ace up her sleeve.By no. A silly, easily predictable and anticlimactic ending instead.Here are some things I think the scriptwriter and the director did wrong: 1) none of the characters are presented with enough depth and lifelikeness - a minute should have been spent to present each principal (girls, cheater, brother, Nash) as a flesh-and-blood person: the daily domestic routines, the job specifics, hobbies, concerns. I guess Melissa tried to do that in her clumsy way, but the ""brain camp"" rant is not what I mean by ""lifelike"".2) no one is either likable enough nor hateworthy enough in this movie. The girls are one-dimensional and paper-thin, and all have traits that many viewers will find detestable (Leslie is ""ditzy"", Kate is a ""bimbo"", Cameron is a never-been-married 42-year-old lawyer who blithely dates a married guy); conversely, the husband character is so demeaned by the diarrhea, the hair-loss and the pregnant nipples that many viewers will stop seeing him as an diabolical slick schemer, and some will even sympathize with him a bit. In other words, the good guys here are not good enough, and the villain is not villainous.3) the finale is abysmal; none of it works - not the dialogue, not the acting, not the set/interior, not the visual composition of the shot. (Upton's presence feels silly and redundant in that scene.) And why even have a stupid Nuremberg-trial showdown for a finale? Why not just write him a letter or record a sarcastic video message, informing him that he's now broke? Way more effective. And even if the producers felt it was absolutely necessary to have a stand-off, why not at least make a show of it - with the girls appearing one by one in some striking, fascinating manner (smoke, mirrors, creepy music), and the villain slowly piecing the girls' plan together, bit-by-bit.4) when you make a film about people in their forties (whose age is accentuated by the presence of 20ish and 30ish hotties of both genders), never miss a chance to fill your movie with beautiful stuff such as epic landscapes, pretty buildings, antiques. Otherwise it'll feel as if your not-too-young characters participate in some kind of rat race, never stopping to enjoy the beauty of the world.5) Leslie's brother Phil should have been played by an actor in mid-forties, and perhaps not too hunky - like a Hugh Laurie type or something.6) If Kate is supposed to be dumb, a lot of attention needed to have been paid to her dumbness - which for writer & director means creating plenty of silly situations, instances of ignorance, mispronunciations. If, on the other hand, she's not inveterately dumb, why make her dumb at all? Why not, instead, give the girl good lines and something to contribute? But I'm a guy, and maybe only a woman can truly appreciate this movie - maybe when cheated on, wives do want their hubbies to shitt pants, shed hair, grow nipples, lose fortunes. Maybe that's why this movie is a ""6"", and not the ""5.3"" it deserves.First Wives Club, which I watched five years ago, was also a bit of a disappointment. It didn't deliver on the same good premise either, and generally had the same weaknesses as ""The Other Woman"".",The Other Woman

We are asked to believe she can be both a victim in a fugue state and a cool and level-headed player in the film's overarching theme of revenge. Further, her acting is so over-the-top and her character so obnoxiously unpleasant that the films falls largely apart due to this. Cameron is showing her age here and some of the shot selections make her look downright homely. I'll confess to laughing once but if this is a comedy, comedy is no longer funny.There's a laundry list of problems with the script, the acting, and more, but for me it was th horror show of Leslie Mann's performance that made this a 2 out of 10 stars.P.U.",The Other Woman

Some people might not like it, but I see that as a no different movie than any other revenge film.",The Other Woman
148,praveer-mishra,Scheming Mistresses Get Their Revenge,3,5 May 2014,"Carly (Cameron Diaz) has the perfect boyfriend Mark (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) tall, handsome, and upwardly mobile. There is just one little tiny problem with their relationship, Mark is married to Kate (Leslie Mann).Fate introduces Kate to his husbands' mistress Carly, when Carly decides to show up unannounced at Mark's home. Kate mistakes Carly to be some kind of strippergram gag for Mark but the two shortly learn that Mark has been using them both. Kate then becomes obsessed with trying to become Carly's friend in order to learn what she has that Kate does not, because in life most women want to befriend their husband's mistress. As the two find enough reasons to spend time with each other they plot their revenge on Mark. During their little reconnaissance mission of the supposed business trip Mark is on, the movie continues to devolve with the introduction of Mark's third woman, Amber (Kate Upton). The subplot involves Mark not only carrying on affairs with all three women but also setting up Kate to possibly take the fall in a shady business scheme. The remainder of the movie is filled in with equal parts gross out comedy, and some really awful physical comedy, as the trio torments an unsuspecting Mark. Add in a really pointless role for Nicki Minaj as Carly's secretary with some cliché dialog, and that is where this thing really bottoms out. While Mark suffers through one lame gag after another, unfortunately the real torment is inflicted on anyone who has to see this movie.THE VERDICT:The Other Woman is supposed to be a romantic comedy that is neither romantic nor comedic...unless you can laugh at how bad this is. The film tries to leverage the success of the film ""Bridesmaids"" but the difference is that Bridesmaids contained likable characters in funny situations. The Other Woman misfires on all levels. Leslie Mann who is a an otherwise good comedic actress is left mugging for the camera and whining throughout. Which is actually an improvement over how one dimensional Cameron Diaz is in this movie. As for Kate Upton? She should stick to modeling, most definitely stick to modeling. The Other Woman is really ends up in territory that should be left for Adam Sandler only.",The Other Woman

This is why I LOVE this movie. It's the acting and the emotions displayed by Cameron, Kate and Leslie this keep watching it over again for years to come.I 100% recommend this movie to ANYONE who is going through a breakup or even at a low in their life.

I'm certainly glad i did!What i liked most was that i was never bored, unlike other movies where i am fast-forwarding parts, and found it entertaining and funny. I liked the storyline and the characters, especially since there were well- known actresses and actors, although Nicki Minaj got on my nerves.

I am sure though, that lots was improvised as the ladies seemed so at ease and naturally funny together.

159,kostyantynsteblovskyy,As seen at Haydn Kino: The Other Woman,7,3 May 2014,"If you were waiting for a chance to laugh your heart out, all you need to do is buy a ticket to watch ""The Other Woman"". The director of ""The Notebook"" brings his charm to the romantic comedy film, written by Melissa Stack, who makes her debut in the cinematic world and comes up with great dialogues, funny jokes and some fair ideas about modern day dating policies.The film goes over the subject of cheating with a fine-tooth comb, but nevertheless also covers trust issues, friendships, complicated relationships, heavy drinking, bad decisions, good decisions, revenge, Kate Upton's flawlessness and last, but not least, waxing. And with all previously mentioned, it stays true to the goal of every comedy movie to make you laugh.Starring Leslie Mann, Cameron Diaz and Kate Upton, as broken-hearted girls, the three will have you rolling in the aisles almost every minute of the movie, except of one scene with Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, which I still wonder how it made the final cut. You'll know it, when you see it!Leslie Mann does an amazing job, playing Kate King, the wife of an unfaithful husband, who battles not to lose her mind after she finds out, that her husband is not really training for the marathon. And although most of you will be going to the cinema to see Cameron Diaz and Kate Upton, in the end of the movie you will be leaving with the best impressions about Leslie Mann, who just rocks with her performance.That does not mean of course, that Cameron Diaz and Kate Upton do not do an excellent job. Cameron Diaz, portrays Carly Whitten, a successful Manhattan attorney, who is the perfect woman as she has the package any man would wish for - yet she is not irreplaceable, especially when ""the lack of sex"" is on the table. Just when Carly tries to explain to everyone that she is really not a mistress, as she did not know that the man she was dating was married, Kate Upton's Amber or also known as ""The Boobs"" from the official trailer, comes into the picture, as the new other woman, who knew she was sleeping with a married man.Read the rest here: http://austriantimes.at/news/Panorama/2014-05- 02/50847/As_seen_at_Haydn_Kino%3A_The_Other_Woman",The Other Woman

161,cc_vivalavida,"Hollywood 1, Bechdel 0",1,29 April 2014,"My experience of watching The Other Woman can best be equated to being presented with a large iced cake, only to take a forkful and realise that beneath a miniscule layer of icing there lies nothing but impacted excrement. The film comes courtesy of director Nick Cassavetes (whose previous crime against celluloid was 2004's The Notebook) and is intended as a story of female empowerment as one woman (Cameron Diaz) who, upon discovering that her boyfriend is married, teams up with the wife (Leslie Mann) and another secret lover (Kate Upton) to take revenge.The biggest of many, many problems with the film is that it pretends to be a story of female empowerment: I'm not sure if I missed a meeting, but since when has swooning over every male character, getting drunk and being sick into handbags been the mainstay of strong female characters? There is also a horrific display of double standards: could you imagine a film where a group of men get their own back on a cheating woman by suggesting that they kick her in between the legs or supply her with hormone pills designed for pre-op trans-sexuals? The initial promise portrayed by the film's poster (a knuckleduster sporting a wedding ring in place of a spike) is scuppered within the first five minutes.The three leads actresses are incessantly annoying, Diaz sporting a possibly plastic-enhanced smile all the way through, Leslie Mann apparently under the belief that any line of dialogue can be made funnier simply by shouting it, and Kate Upton is there purely for set dressing. The second Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (playing the cheating husband) walks into frame, the women (even the ones he has cheated on and lied to) can't help but fall instantly in love with him. Nicki Minaj is cast as an assistant to Diaz' lawyer character (no, I'm not making that up), and spends her scenes plastered in grotesque layers of make-up and doing her best to shove her bottom at the camera.As if that last piece of casting wasn't enough, the entire film seems to be populated by the interior decoration of Maxim magazine, everyone looking perfectly tanned with perfect hair and nails and sporting snow-white teeth. None of the events or the dialogue bears anything even resembling real life, at best looking slightly tacky and at worst giving characters lines like 'you need to cry on the inside, like winners do'. I guess that makes me the biggest winner in the entire universe, because I left the cinema positively bursting with internal tears.At best, one could say that the film is coherently put togetherand that's it. There is nothing else in this vacuous, grotesque, star-studded pile of crap to redeem it, and the fact that it has just taken around $25 million in America is a depressing reminder of the state of modern cinema. At least Devil's Due had the decency to make me feel so ill that I could have prematurely left the cinema with my integrity intact, but The Other Woman kept me pinned, mentally kicking and screaming for the entirety of its' unbearable 110 minutes.",The Other Woman
162,JustTexasChamelion,Complete Hilarity........,10,6 January 2015,I absolutely LOVE this movie! I am stunned that people are rating it so low. I found it very entertaining and was surprised at how much I laughed. Just when I thought it had hit the funniest point and would slow down it got funnier. All of the characters were perfectly portrayed in my opinion.You have your lying sneaky guy who has a great wife whose soul purpose in life is to support his career. The girlfriend who just adores him is clueless he is married. Someone plans a big surprise and the roller-coaster of hilarity begins. I won't give away any of it but if you miss this one you are doing yourself a disfavor!!! The antics the characters engulf themselves in are such a riot. The scenery is great. Every situation so well planned out this movie ..in my opinion..is simply flawless.Keep your remote handy because you will laugh so hard you'll need to rewind to catch something else that just happened it is DEFINITELY a MUST SEE!,The Other Woman
163,lucyyy,Unlikely friends are the best of friends,8,19 January 2015,"This film combines three different kinds of women into one ""ideal"" girlfriend. As actresses, Diaz, Mann, and Upton also are very different, and it is enjoyable to see their characters interacting. The film has the perfect amount of humor, most of it crude but not vulgar. It is a very quick paced movie and viewers want to see what comes next. Everything comes together in the end nicely, as well, and the antagonist gets what he deserves. This film may be more pleasing to female audiences, because of the strong idea of female power. Women can put themselves in the shoes of the three leading ladies, and imagine how amusing it would be to sabotage an unworthy man. The ways in which the sabotage is done are very creative, whether it be hair removal, laxatives, or a toothbrush dipped in the toilet, the audience will get a good laugh. This is the type of movie that could be watched whenever it is on, if one is not up for a film that needs complete attentiveness or puts you in an emotional mood. It is a feel good film that many different kinds of people can enjoy, especially if you still find dumb sex jokes funny.

My boyfriend even caught himself belly-laughing out loud a handful of times during this movie. It was just what I needed: a lighthearted, feel-good comedy that ultimately becomes a story about female friendship and self-empowerment. If you're a girl who's ever been betrayed, felt insecure, down in the dumps, or felt like you've lost the upper-hand in a relationship, go see this movie! It will pick you up, dust you off, give you a pep talk, and remind you of how important it is to have good girl friends that make you laugh and pick you up when you're down. It might also make you paranoid that your perfectly charming husband is having a secret affair... but try not to let it have that effect on you. :)",The Other Woman

Just overall, this was a horribly difficult movie to watch. Leslie Mann's character's lack of proper tact in all circumstances (forcing her way into Cameron Diaz's life) was almost worthy of walking out of the theater.

The movie was quite predictable as there has been movies like this made previously where ex girlfriends finds out about other affairs and plan together to take the ultimate revenge. So, it was nothing new but some scenes were different and hilarious. To be honest, there were some funny moments to share. A typically funny movie to enjoy with friends but I would not recommend watching it with a girlfriend as it might be nostalgic situation.

When I came inside the theater, I thought it will bore me to death. Only to find out that when I came out, I was still smiling my heart out.

That movie was so much better than This Means War. Basically, The Other Woman was about Kate (Leslie Mann) finding out that her husband Mark (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau) has been sleeping with Carly (Cameron Diaz) and they become friends and try to ruin Mark's life. They soon find out that Mark has also been sleeping with another woman named Amber (Kate Upton). Leslie Mann and Cameron Diaz had me laughing almost the entire time.

173,liliamarquez93,A film focused on three women out for revenge against the man who cheated on them.,8,29 July 2014,"Definitely turned out better than I had expected, (due to certain reviews I'd read.) I got the impression that this movie would be a cheap knock off to the movie John Tucker Must Die but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and though these two films do hold the same concept I thought that The Other Woman did a fantastic job of creating its own take on the idea that it centered around. I liked that this was an adult version of many movies out there similar to this; because instead of feeling over done or repetitive, it was fresh and creative. I loved that they strayed from typical romance takeovers, (that usually envelope around this sort of project,) and stuck with the basic idea of the three main female characters creating a bond throughout the whole experience. Yes there was some incline to romance at the end but that's all it was, a short summary of what turned out instead of a bubble of love they try and pin on audiences. I enjoyed the dry humor and comedy in this movie, I'd definitely recommend it. It's a great watch and a nice film to just enjoy a night in. As to the character and the actors playing them, I loved it, I thought they were great and what's not to like about a film featuring Cameron Diaz and Leslie Mann, two amazing actresses and although I haven't watched allot of Kate Upton's Work I think she did a great job despite not having as big of a script as the other leads. That's about it, it's a decent film, I say watch it if you haven't and be the judge, see for yourself because with this sort of thing it's really a 50/50.",The Other Woman

There were a few funny moments but otherwise the comedy felt cheap and did not reflect what I saw in the trailer. I thought this was a movie of revenge, instead the part where the girls actually take action against the cheater is relatively small. I admit that I did leave the theatre after the first hour and twenty minutes but nothing new was happening. The story was beyond bland which is very sad since this movie had so much potential.

I think Kate, mark's wife, is supposed to be kind of stupid but also funny, kinda like Michelangelo from the teenage mutant ninja turtles series but it fails miserably. Also this movie has fart jokes which usually never work and that doesn't change in this movie. Also some of the jokes are just very bad, the only one that made me kind of laugh at was one, about fight club.

Shallow, high-pitched crazy trying to pass as cute, the only thing that she inspired me to do is to want to punch her in the face. I kept waiting for the moment the movie would turn funny, a friend even suggested that it's perhaps not meant to be a comedy since there wasn't a funny scene happening for the first hour.

Sure, there were moments when you thought - hey this doesn't make any sense, but if you park reality at the door, and just sit and enjoy the hilarity of the situation and the characters, it was pretty entertaining. I left the theater satisfied that my movie dollars were well spent for a couple of hours of diversion from life's troubles.

Diaz was a little unappealing as the bitch lawyer and perhaps Kate Upton's acting does leave something to be desired.

Having walked into the cinema with the premonition that it would be the adult version of a teenage feel-good flick I was, actually, pleasantly surprised -though, not wrong. Despite many films such as ""The First Wives Club"" and the fore-mentioned ""John Tucker Must Die"" being obvious influences on the script, the film channels aspects of every woman's life and combines them to create the ultimate revenge for the ultimate cheating misogynist. Yes, of course, the story has been done before -as has every single chick flick story in the history of cinematography- but that does not take away from ""The Other Woman"" being a man and a woman's feel good comedy. Packed with one liners, witty jokes, beautiful locations and hilarious protagonists the film is heart-warming and highlights the importance of friendship, love and sisterhood.A very entertaining film.",The Other Woman

We couldn't stop laughing and it wasn't the typical cheesy Hollywood humor. It was very smart. It got a little cheesy toward the end as they were tying up loose ends, but I would honestly watch this over and over again. I have a masters in creative writing so I'm no easy audience. Honestly, what a bummer that I almost passed it by as a result of the poor reviews! My fiancé is also quite the critic and he was calling me every 15 minutes or so, laughing, telling me about the last scene that he watched. It was so good that we paid for it on Amazon Prime twice--once for me to watch and again when I told him, ""You HAVE to see this.""",The Other Woman

And I do think the acting women pulled it off! Unfortunately I do agree with reviewers which mentioned bad acting from the male character. But it didn't bother me that much to make the movie less enjoyable. This is a typical chick flick, and the kind you want to watch on a lazy Sunday. Because I love that kind of movie from time to time, and I think this one is just the wright fit, I gave it a high rating. But I can understand this movie is not for anyone.

Time sure does fly!) My hat is off to Leslie Mann. Her comedic skills were top notch. She should be on SNL. Found out through IMDb that she is married to a movie producer but she herself is not that well known in my mind. I think she should be in more movies just for her entertainment value that she adds. I am getting nearer to my 10 lines but really can't think of much more to say. Not sure why the reviews have to be so long. I do recommend this movie if you are looking for light-hearted fare.

Cameron Diaz was funny, as usual, but Leslie Mann's performance pushed the film from a 6 to an 8. Even Nicki Minaj (not a fan) has some acting skills, though she is known already for her many ""characters."" Taylor Kinney...who is he? Hmmm, he was so-so; his acting started out very rough in the film. The other actors were great.An unlikely storyline, the band of wife and mistresses becomes believable. Coincidentally watched The First Wives Club a couple days later and this movie is like the updated, raunchy, and edgy version of that. Great storyline and it (and the characters) developed wonderfully! I say... go see it. Or at least watch it on video!",The Other Woman

I especially loved Cameron Diaz, she is so funny, as always in her movies! Kate Upton did better than I imagined, and concerning Leslie Mann, even though her voice annoys me a bit, I found her great! Thinking back, I think that her voice really suited her character after all. As for Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, he made me laugh a lot and I really hated his character in the movie. I think that the choice of actors and actresses really paid off and made the movie shine, because I don't think the plot was THAT amazing. In fact, I think the plot/some scenes were quite similar to the movie John Tucker Must Die. So I guess the movie itself lacked some originality. But anyways, I still laughed a lot and considering myself as a really a hard person to make laugh, I was very surprised to find the funny scenes and jokes hilarious.",The Other Woman

It honestly deserves some Oscars I really applaud the casting director and it's actors. But overall the movie was excellent, then I have to say that nicki minaj really showed me how she can act and I was still stunned on her fabulous work.

196,hugo-olsson-orgryte-gbg,Just terrible,1,20 April 2015,"I could not possibly despise this movie any more that I do. It has practically captured everything that is wrong with film making in Hollywood today and made it into a movie. What frustrates me even more is all the people who call it ""hilarious"". Cause it was anything but hilarious. Not one joke was original and not one of the characters contributed to the plot in any other way than with pure slapstick. The acting was pretty bad throughout the movie and a lot of what happened in the movie made no sense whatsoever. Take this for an example: Why on earth did Cameron Diaz get so upset about seeing that Mark was also cheating with a younger girl. Feeling insulted and getting angry would be fine, but running after her trying to do whatever she was trying to do was just hurtfully out of proportion and made her character come of, if possible, even worse. The so-called ""strong bonds of friendship"" that the characters form is so thin I could practically break them just breathing on them. Not one scene made the characters evolve with each other. And all the let's-bond-through-trying- on-shoes-and-talk-about-shaving kind of crap that was meant to fill this purpose just made you think of the characters as brainless morons with nothing better to do than hanging out with their husbands mistress. And as for the ending: What was that even about? Why did he start walking into glass walls, and more importantly; why did they just break? That must happen like a dozen times during a regular working day! And if you put all of this together and think: Wow! That seems like you mentioned everything that could possibly be wrong with a movie, then you are wrong! Because all of this combined does not even touch the level of awfulness that the character Mark is sculptured out of. He is simply nothing but evil, without even being aware of it himself! Why not just go ahead and name him Mr. Evil 2014! Then we would at least know where we had him! But wait, we already do, because his character took less than a blink of an eye to figure out!

Today it is available on Blue ray DVD and unless it costs 99 cents it is not worth it. People who leave 10 stars for this movie must be affiliated with the movie producer and DVD seller themselves.The movie should be considered as a regular drama movie and not a comedy movie because there is not many things to lough at. I have seen better movies where a person is cheating on their wife or girlfriend and there was more action.

Superb! The movie itself, not so much... Leslie Mann as the deceived wife is extremely annoying and gross; up to the point that I thought the movie was going to be about her realization of how unpleasantness is not the best way to keep your husband's love. A number of dubiously original or amusing gags ensue to her discovery of 'the other woman' - aka Cameron Diaz in a refreshingly mature and sedated role-; including dipping the husband's toothbrush in urine and mixing his food with copious amounts of estrogen AND a laxative; which in my book classifies at attempt poisoning and not just an amusing way of getting payback.

Even with all the people trying to stop sexual assault, we have this film try and make light of it with phrases like ""why don't we kick him in the balls"". You are left wondering if we had switched the genders around if that would of been as funny to these people...You have to wonder why people trying to make films based on revenge like this. Clearly this was meant for women to enjoy. You don't see men longing for films which depict men taking revenge on their cheating wives by drugging them and causing physical harm to them. As a result I think this film tells you a lot about the mentality and intelligence level this film was aimed at which as a woman who doesn't stoop to these levels of childish revenge fantasy but just moves on with my life like guys do this film just re-I forced the fact that a lot of women need to grow up.Perhaps we should be making films to teach women how to, rather than encouraging this infantile behavior shown In this film.",The Other Woman

I came to a point where I couldn't breathe as I was laughing so much- a nice bit of stress relief. I didn't find that there were laughing moments the WHOLE way through- I don't know why the critics didn't like this though- at least it's not just a mindless comedy. It has a genuine plot line which is followed through- a comedy with substance- it's not just one funny scenario after another and this emphasises the hilarity of the funny moments that do come up. Would definitely recommend it- left me buzzing after wards- can be enjoyed by everyone. I found Leslie Mann was the shining star of the movie- so was Cameron Diaz (slightly less so than Mann).

Cameron Diaz is starting to look a bit old to play these parts, but she pulled it off for this movie and she was fabulous in the part. Kate Upton isn't the best actress in the world, but no more than she had to act, she did fine, however, the person who made this movie was Leslie Mann. This is the first thing I've seen her in, but she was awesome. The movie was clean and it was delightful. The only downside to it was that the audience was laughing so hard, you missed some of the lines. The end of it was a little over done in my opinion, but we are talking about 2 minutes out of 100.

The movie itself is a very simple rehash of an often used plot device, that of revenge. But there are points in this movie where one is left wondering if the director simply wanted to get off on the whole, ""men are evil and stupid"" thing and because of that, If I were rating this movie on its sexist, misandrist content, I would give it 10/10. The movie, however, is very far from this. I won't be including any spoilers as that would simply deny you the sheer frothing hatred that will inevitably pour forth from you upon watching this failed excuse of a movie. Just something to point out though, take all the characters in this movie and reverse their roles, and see how that plays out. I imagine if you do you will quickly be forced to realize that had that been the case the movie would simply never have made it to air, and if somehow it did, would have been rightly castrated as the sexist, misandrist drivel that it really is. Now that we've reached the 21st Century, I really hoped we'd never be seeing crap like this anymore.",The Other Woman

With Mark's wife Kate (Leslie Mann) together they get their revenge on the two-timing bastard, and they quickly discover yet another affair with the much younger Amber (Kate Upton), so the cheater is actually a three-timing bastard.THE OTHER WOMAN has a brand new screenplay and is also a female buddy movie, but this oft-used theme of women getting even does immediately remind one of Olivia Goldsmith's book and movie called FIRST WIVES CLUB (1996). With its unrealistic and unlikely storyline, THE OTHER WOMAN is a raunchier, edgier take on the subject.Of course the audience is anticipating how the revenge will play out with the excessive consumption of alcohol including shots. With the clever use of music to quickly move the story forward the movie's 109 minutes went by at high speed, and there are many gross shocks and surprises ahead, as the three women royally set up their man.Sports Illustrated model - Kate Upton at 21 years of age- appears to have been cast in her role as the silly bimbo, simply as a result of her upper body size. What the casting agent missed was spotted by every woman in the audience, her cellulite.Leslie Mann is perpetually typecast in this kind of role although this reviewer was very impressed by the range of her emotionally driven performance. Nicki Minaj (Carly's secretary) delivers her witty modern day metaphors with great aplomb.The audience were mainly women, and from their constant laughter, they left their sense of reality at home! They got real pleasure from the rough treatment deal out to the cheating husband, including the physical injuries.

Leslie Mann was awesome I didn't think he could play such a goofy role :) I recommend this movie to anyone who wants a good laugh and wants to see some ho and talented actresses!! Its start off with Cameran Diaz and the SOB their all lovey and what not soon after were introduced to the WIFE she's a total dork so sweet but naïve. It becomes obvious that the SOB is only using her for his own good (you will learn what I mean if you watch it) but Kate Upton aka boobs is not introduce until waaaaaaaay later one and shes the young one with not much to say lol ooo and nicki minaj mini role was also a killer for the movie felt like total DIVA CONTROL MOVIE LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!,The Other Woman

Cameron Diaz still has it going on and the girl who played the main actress was really funny. The only bad thing I can say is Taylor Kinney cannot act to save his life. He's one of the worst actors I've ever seen. Painful to watch. I guess looks are everything in Hollywood. On the up side of things the main actor was really good and it was a pleasant surprise to see Don Johnson. It was neat seeing how the two main women switched roles and one became more loving and the other became ore independent. It was a cute movie overall and I would recommend it.

But i must say that i didn't like the end of the movie. I mean it was great the way that they busted him, but his reaction to it was just a little bit too much. The screaming was fine and all, but the way he crushed into that glass and broke his nose? I mean come on! That was just too much. I would definitely leave that outI didn't like the part where he ran off and just pushed the girl away, that was also like what is going on, it was just off. And then of course again into the glass and the glass just boom broke. That does not happen and it was just over done if you ask me. The end would have been just fine if they busted him and that's it. But after all i like this movie and i would give it a solid 7 or even 8, because of all that woman power.

There are some parts that I recommend no one under middle school should see or else they might not understand some of the humor in the movie. If you watch the trailer it may give away some of the spoilers and some of the funny parts but it will make you get up and go watch it. Carmen Diaz really puts some effort into her character which makes the movie even better. Plus the end you won't see coming.

Men = evil, cunning entity driven by his urges. Women = kind, stupid and caring person. However at the happy end, where these girls apply their revenge, truth suddenly appears and show them as evil and careless human beings, while this cunning men is just driven by his urges.",The Other Woman
221,caluacacia,So UNFUNNY that the Outtakes Reel wasn't even funny....,2,25 August 2014,"This movie is complete and total garbage... please do not waste any money on watching it. Its completely unfunny, the acting is so BAD, this is the worst movie I have ever seen Cameron Diaz create... I honestly can't believe she did it. She also looks horrible in the movie. The male ""actors"" in this movie are forgettable, the guy they are all fighting over is not even overly good looking. What a waste of 2 hours of your life. Don't watch it! I even made sure that I rented the HD Bloopers reel version of this movie, thinking that it would be cool to see all of the funny outtakes after the movie was over. I didn't laugh ONCE on the outtakes... nothing funny happened in this movie, and that is proof! I also have to say that I love Leslie Mann... I think she's funny in every movie I have seen before; she's not funny here. The whole premise of the movie is just junk, please don't waste your time.",The Other Woman
222,mrsashe2005,This is Terrible,2,27 September 2014,"I have a long history of choosing bad movies; with my friends as well as my husband, and his one makes that list. Terrible acting by Diaz and the red haired chick, who was trying to be funny, but didn't make the cut. It just seemed to get worse as the movie played on, the end was groan worthy and predictable. Don't bother....it's really awful, leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I am rating in 2 out of 10 because my husband laughed when the dog pooped on the floor and spit his beer across the room, which in turn made me laugh. My husband just reminded me of my last choice, ""Abduction"" with Jacob Lautner...which he says was worse. Next choice, ""Neighbors"", we'll see how bad that one is.",The Other Woman
223,leah-davies2001,Really Good Fun,8,3 October 2014,"I have been waiting for this film forever and when I got to finally see it, I wasn't disappointed. I love how at the start how everything seemed like a romantic tale but then it turns out he's playing loads of women. My favourite part is when Carly, Amber and Kate start doing pranks on him, the prank I find most hilarious is when he grows boobs because Kate gave him hormone replacement pills in his smoothies. I would love if they made a sequel where it shows all the girls after, especially as Carly is pregnant with Kate's brother. However, I don't think they will make one as they will not be able to follow the same story line.",The Other Woman
224,savannahwilkins1,Absolutely Amazing.,10,1 November 2014,"Do not listen to critic reviews they just down movies for attention . This movie is hilarious, witty, and interesting. Seeing how the girls bond will make you almost wish this was happening to you! I just imagined all the fun they had and me in their place, it was an awesome movie. I signed up just to review this movie if you don't read anything I say just take this advice. Watch the movie yourself. Cameron Diaz, Leslie Mann, and Kate Upton played their roles stupendously and each had their own unique skill to bring into the sisterhood and none were as dumb as one might think. I would rate this movie a 100 out of 10 if I could I cried during the last 10 minutes just seeing how each life was changed as a result.",The Other Woman
225,deena-195-105652,Excellent movie for the most part,8,25 December 2014,Wasn't expecting much as the reviews were pretty dismal however I was pleasantly surprised and found myself laughing out loud. It's not a serious movie. If you don't have a sense of humor and only watch award winning flicks then it's not for you. Seems like the critics never like a movie that's simply fun. Ignore them. Look at the total box office. It's a pretty major success. Leslie Mann is great. Kate Upton is a little weak but acting isn't her strong point anyway. She does her part well. Cameron Diaz is excellent as usual. I will say the ending isn't as good as it could have been but whatever.......its well worth your time. Have fun.,The Other Woman
226,jwikander,Watch Again Funny,9,27 February 2015,"This movie is time and time again funny. I saw it in theatres and purchased it as soon as it came out.Leslie Mann is by far an underrated comedian. She did extremely well in this movie! She did well going from serious to funny, which can sometimes make or break a movie. I feel like she was the best character in the movie.Cameron Diaz did good as the stone cold you know what. She had her moments and it was smart to bring a big name to this production.Kate Upton was just too similar to my friends. I feel like the vapid character has been super overplayed and is very 2007. Ehh, could have done something better.The biggest thing this movie lacked was a great soundtrack!",The Other Woman
227,hellointernet,Waist of time,1,7 April 2015,"'The Other Woman' was incredibly boring, wast of time but above all predictable despite the fact I've never seen the trailer. It was obvious how the whole movie was going to turn out before the 10 minute mark, I wish that I would have just stop the movie then. There are so many good movies out there but this is NOT one of them!The character development was almost non-existent, story line have been done before (nothing new here), songs didn't have any effect on the mood. I like most of the actors staring in this movie but even Cameron Diaz couldn't save this movie.If the movie was supposed to empower woman it did nothing of the sorts, in fact the stereotypical characters were insulting, Kate Upton's role as Amber was particularly disturbing. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!",The Other Woman
228,superrutu,Refreshing!,7,4 June 2015,"""The Other Woman "" appears to be just another one of those ""Chic-lits"" but it is clearly something more. Yes, the name gives out what it is going to be like , but as the film unfolds it pleasantly surprises you! There is a certain "" feel good"" charm about this movie. Although it is a bit lengthy for a Hollywood movie, it never tends to get boring. The characters actually make you care about them and you secretly want justice to be served in the best way possible. It is a little predictable and the characters are a little larger than life but that just makes them likable and helps the story to develop. The character of Lydia could have been handled better , but nothing to really complain about. I recommend you to watch this movie when you are feeling a little blue .It will surely lift your spirits and reinstate hope!",The Other Woman
229,peterjamesday,Well there's 2 hours we won't get back,2,18 September 2015,"what a waste of time, the plot seemed a good idea, the actresses seemed a good choice, but how anyone can laugh out loud at this garbage is beyond me. All involved must have been working for a pay check, no talent was involved , simply going through the motions , doesn't even make it as a Rom com, over the top acting and a rubbish script.... Cameron Diaz is usually good, but this was below par, the love rat was dreadful and I felt no sympathy for him, but I guess I wasn't supposed to, so that one thing worked in the movie, and now I'm just typing to fill up ten lines so this review is acceptable to IMDb So to summarise, it was rubbish, oh and return to sender is crap too...",The Other Woman
230,zillah_charis,Finally seeing laugh out loud female humour,9,21 May 2021,"I absolutely adore this film. It makes me laugh so much. It's wonderful to be seeing such diverse female characters that don't fit into the typical stereotypes. The fact that women end up in different states of ""success"" at the end rather than all of them finding love and giving up their career like many typical Rom Com endings is refreshing. The only bit I don't really like is the ending which is slightly too gory to fit with the general tone but that's literally my only criticism. The two main characters are so funny and work really well together. If you're looking for a factory made, average Rom Com then this isn't the place to come. If you like female comedy, quick wit and layers of detail in a story then this will keep you watching time and time again.",The Other Woman
231,samftoo,Thoroughly Enjoyed This Movie!,10,30 December 2017,"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie! The physical comedy and clever dialogue kept us entertained from beginning to end. The actors all did an excellent job and the script was strong and captivating. Interestingly, we had started to watch 2 movies prior to this one, got bored with them both, one after 10 minutes and one after 20 minutes. We started this one up to give it a try and were reeled in instantly! We both highly recommend this movie!",The Other Woman
232,g_dabrowski,underrated film,8,5 June 2017,"this film is better than it's current IMDb rating (June 2017) of 6.0 would suggest...it's not ""all good"" as they like to say in California, but it's surprisingly funny and skillfully directed... there is an amusing mix of dry & sophomoric humor which (existing together in one movie) is relatively uncommon in American film...having SI cover girl kate upton with a significant role in the film does not ruin the film, as is often the case when supermodels turn up in movies and come across like cigar store indians...8/10...",The Other Woman
233,likki-69972,Beware of miracles...,7,16 April 2021,"A really funny film, with great representation of childless women (which is rare!)...but the epilogue lets it down with an unnecessary miracle for one of the older female characters. It added nothing to the story save for a feeling of bitterness that movies still need this trope to be viable in Hollywood.",The Other Woman
