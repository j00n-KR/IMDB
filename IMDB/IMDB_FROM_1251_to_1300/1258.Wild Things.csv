0,Leofwine_draca,Twist-a-minute thriller,7,3 February 2013,"I remember when WILD THINGS came out on first release; for some reason, it never appealed to me. Back then I only cared about horror films like SCREAM, and this sleazy-looking thriller didn't have what it took to whet my appetite back then. Fourteen years later my tastes have broadened a great deal, so I decided to check it out.WILD THINGS turns out to be a real thrill-ride of a film, and that's all down to Stephen Peters' script, which is tremendous. It packs more genuinely surprising twists into its running time than half a dozen other Hollywood thrillers, and you can never predict where it's about to go next.An ensemble cast of actors known for appearances in sometimes-trashy cinema adds to the appeal. Matt Dillon does well balancing a difficult leading role, and Kevin Bacon has fun as a hard-ass cop, riffing on a role he must have played dozens of times during his career. Denise Richards, too, appears to be having a good time, trading on her cheerleader looks to decent effect, though Neve Campbell can't seem to shift her SCREAM-style goody two-shoes persona.Watch out for decent production values, slick direction from John McNaughton (HENRY: PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER) and a wicked supporting role for Bill Murray.",Wild Things
1,SnoopyStyle,Fully committed campy noir sexploitation,6,5 August 2014,"In the Florida glades town of Blue Bay, Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards) is the rich queen bee of the high school. Her father killed himself leaving her with her flirtatious mother (Theresa Russell). Sam Lombardo (Matt Dillon) is the school counselor accused of raping her. Police detectives Ray Duquette (Kevin Bacon) and Gloria Perez (Daphne Rubin-Vega) investigate. Sam hires unscrupulous defense lawyer Ken Bowden (Bill Murray). Suzie Toller (Neve Campbell) is the outsider poor white trash classmate who has a similar story about Sam raping her. Both stories have Sam saying No little girl can make me come.As a noir crime mystery, this is way too convoluted to be compelling. It tries to be hard-boiled but it has a few too many twists. It has two or three twists too many. The good thing here is that this is a full-on campy sexploitation and the movie knows it. Director John McNaughton happily and proudly wades through the muck. This is deliberate cheese and there is some good fun to be had. Bill Murray is really camping it up. The threesome is famous or infamous on par with Sharon Stone. It's a cheap guilty pleasure.",Wild Things
2,kosmasp,This is where the Wild Things are,9,28 September 2010,"Maybe at this time some of the names are not really saying a lot to folks right now. But back when they made the picture (I know it's only just over a decade, but still) those names meant something. Denise Richards was just fresh of the success of Starship Troopers and onto being a Bond girl. Neve Campbell came off the success of Scream and it seemed she had a wonderful career in front of her. Those two women were doing an erotic thriller? It was a dream come true (no pun intended) for most fan-boys. But what really made this movie work (apart from the great acting by everyone involved) was the script. It is very twisted and wicked, but also very good and suspenseful. So apart from the obvious titillating scenes, there is more here that will get you excited ...Try not to read too much about the story and just enjoy this thriller for what it is ... a great B-movie with great actors and a really great story.",Wild Things
3,gavin6942,John McNaughton's Twists and Turns,8,29 September 2014,"A police detective uncovers a conspiracy behind a case involving a high-school guidance counselor when accusations of rape are made against him by two female students.While this film is perhaps not as critically-acclaimed as the crime comedy ""Mad Dog and Glory"", this is the more satisfying McNaughton police story, with a great mystery and more intrigue. You never really know who is working with who until the very end.The DVD commentary pays close attention to all the attempts to have beautiful lighting and backgrounds. There are a few behind the scenes tips, such as the use of cardboard where more expensive visuals would be no better. We even find out that one scene is actually an homage to ""Red River"", which you might never have figured out.",Wild Things
4,lee_eisenberg,our introduction to Denise Richards,7,3 May 2006,"Obviously, the scene in ""Wild Things"" that really surprised everyone was a certain scene with Kevin Bacon. But as for the rest of the movie, it involves a rape lawsuit in a Florida high school, and the strange things that follow. I'm not sure how much I can tell you without giving it away. I never would have envisioned so many twists and turns in a movie. As it was, this was our introduction to Denise Richards (although she had earlier appeared in the worth-seeing ""Starship Troopers""). All in all, if you come away from this movie royally confused, don't say that I didn't warn you. But don't get me wrong: it's a pretty interesting movie. Also starring Matt Dillon, Neve Campbell, Theresa Russell, Robert Wagner, Bill Murray and Carrie Snodgress.",Wild Things
5,jboothmillard,Wild Things,6,12 March 2007,"I can agree with the critics that the most notable scenes are X-rated, and the story isn't exactly all great, but if you like that, it's one to watch. Basically high school counselor Sam Lombardo (Matt Dillon) is taken to court when he reported by Kelly Lanier Van Ryan (Denise Richards, after her big break in Starship Troopers) that he raped her. Suzie Marie Toller (Scream's Neve Campbell) also tells the police that he raped her, in court however, there is a big fight when she tells the court it was a lie, and she believes Kelly is doing the same. The big twist however turns out that the three of them are in an agreement in order to get a big cash settlement. Sgt. Ray Duquette (Kevin Bacon) is determined to prove that he knows this agreement. It gets pretty crucial when it looks like they kill Suzie, and then Kelly dies. All the big action however takes place on Sam's boat when you find out Suzie's death was faked. Also starring Theresa Russell as Sandra Van Ryan, Daphne Rubin-Vega as Det. Gloria Perez, Austin Powers' Robert Wagner as Tom Baxter and Bill Murray as Kenneth Bowden. The great threesome with Richards' fantastic breasts was number 21 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Good!",Wild Things
6,rmax304823,Sex and Money.,6,11 August 2011,"It would be a major mistake to take this seriously because it must have been meant to be a comedy. It's actually pretty amusing. It follows in the train of such hits as ""Basic Instinct,"" ""The Mean Season,"" ""Masquerade,"" ""Fatal Passion"", or whatever. Everything is parodied. The score slyly chuckles as it traces the contours of Bernard Hermann's masterful theme in ""Vertigo"", shamelessly ripping off the ostinato. The plot rests on a kind of pretzel logic in which everybody is in cahoots with somebody else. It's too complicated to describe. But let's say that Matt Dillon is a proletarian guidance counselor at an elite Florida high school. He teams up with two luscious babes -- Denise Richards of the unending bosoms and Neve Campbell as her friend. The two gals are bisexual and are getting it on with each other as well was with Matt Dillon and the local detective, Kevin Bacon. Dillon and the succulent babes have a false rape charge brought against him, Dillon, and afterwards they sue the rear ends of Richards' mother and her husband, Teresa Russell and Robert Wagner. Much duplicity follows and multiple murders. All is not explained until the end credits roll. I told you it was complicated.I don't think it's worth commenting on the acting since it's all a joke anyway. If you doubt that it's a joke, consider this scene. Dillon and Richards have apparently murdered Campbell, wrapped her body in a shower curtain or a plastic tarp, and bundle the remains into the rear of an SUV. The two killers climb into the front seats. There is a pause. Then Richards says, ""My mother would kill me if she knew I took the Rover."" The funniest part is just about over by the time Bill Murray, as a shabby storefront lawyer, disappears from the plot. Here's how we first meet Murray. At the point where Dillon is charged with rape and about to be hauled into court, he seeks out Murray, who is seated behind his desk wearing a neck brace. Dillon sits down and begins to spill his sad tale but interrupts himself to ask, ""What IS that thing?"" Murray says, ""Oh, this is nothing. I can take it off any time I want."" He peeks out the window and mutters, ""There was this insurance guy around here a while ago."" Then he tears off the neck brace, flings it away, and sits back to hear the rest of the story. The director doesn't miss a stroke. He gives us a brief shot of the lawyer's wall, papered over with pictures of successful clients, all black, swathed in bandages, waving checks, and wearing big grins.I'm not sure all the performers knew they were in a comedy. Some are like Margaret Dumont in the Marx Brothers' movies. But the director certainly knows the kind of material he's dealing with. Richards and Campbell have an argument in a swimming pool and while Richards is apparently holding her buddy under water and drowning her, the camera lingers salaciously on Richards' jiggling boobs. It's a magnificent display of bad taste. If the camera had a neck I would wring it.Robert Wagner is in this, too, along with Kevin Bacon. Let's see. RJ was my supporting player in the unforgettable artistic triumph ""Windmills of the Gods."" Or was it ""Rage of Angels""? I forget. Anyway, that gives me a Kevin Bacon number of one. As for Kevin Bacon, I get a Kevin Bacon number of two.Nice shots of Florida beaches. Man-eating alligators. Sailboats of such dimensions that I couldn't afford the upkeep and neither could you. But, withal, this is a message movie, funny or not. The message is that money buys an opulent existence on a tropical beach with Neve Campbell as a companion. Don't worry. She's a genius, with ""an IQ of 200"", which puts her right up there with John Stuart Mill. To prove it, she remarks that the name of the sailboat is ""Helios"" and brings up Medea and Creon and some other high-falutin' Greek. She's sexy too. The only thing is, you have to keep one eye open all night.",Wild Things
7,Tweekums,Is anything or anyone quite what they seem in this steamy thriller?,8,15 June 2016,"Sam Lombardo is a councillor at a high school in Blue Bay; a town in southern Florida. He is popular with the students; a little too popular in some cases. His life is turned upside down when one of his pupils, Kelly the daughter of a rich woman Sam had been involved with, accuses him of rape. At first it looks as though she has made up the allegation as revenge for him rejecting her advances but when a second girl, Suzie, makes a very similar accusation Sam is arrested and it goes to trial. As the trial proceeds it becomes apparent that the two girls had been colluding and Lombardo is cleared. It isn't long before his lawyer has extracted a multi-million dollar settlement. Shortly after we get the first major twist of the film; it emerges that Sam, Kelly and Suzie had planned everything to get the money. They will have to be careful though as police officer Ray Duquette is sure he knows what they have done and is determined to prove it. As the tension rises tempers fray and it isn't long before somebody is dead and it looks like others may follow before the end credits.This film is best known for the threesome involving Matt Dillon, Neve Campbell and Denise Richards; this is a pity as the film is far more than that one scene in fact anybody watching for raunchy content is likely to be disappointed as it is fairly tame by modern standards. However people looking for a solid thriller with plenty of twists and turns is likely to be pleasantly surprised. Once the trial is over we get the first major twist but there are plenty of others before the story is over. Twists often seem forced but these worked and should keep the viewer guessing until the very end. The cast do an impressive job; Matt Dillon is perfect as Lombardo, making the character suspicious enough that we wonder about his guilt without making us certain of it. Twenty-somethings Neve Campbell and Denise Richards are suitably sexy as the eighteen year old temptresses Suzie and Kelly. Kevin Bacon is solid enough as Ray Duquette but characters who are meant to be good as often not as interesting as those who are obviously bad. Bill Murray is also a lot of fun as Lombardo's dubious lawyer. Overall this is a lot of fun; don't be put off by its reputation; it isn't all that sleazy.",Wild Things
8,BA_Harrison,"Wild Things, you make my heart sing.",8,27 September 2012,"A tawdry tale of sex, murder, money and betrayal, John McNaughton's neo-noir Wild Things comes across like a gloriously trashy blend of Body Heat and Cruel Intentions, only with bigger boobs and a greater degree of salacious Sapphic snogging.The film has more outrageous twists and turns than a worm at a zumba workout—no-one is who they seem to be, everyone is looking out for number one, and there are no depths to which the characters won't sink in order to achieve their goals—but director McNaughton copes admirably with the movie's many Machiavellian machinations, adeptly juggling the complex script's many plot threads whilst still ensuring that matters move at a reasonably brisk pace.A superb ensemble cast also helps to make this a hugely entertaining time-waster, the acting talent including Matt Dillon, Kevin Bacon, Robert Wagner, Bill Murray, Theresa Russell, Neve Campbell and, last but not least, Denise Richards, who admittedly couldn't act her way out of a soggy paper bag, but who at least helps make good on the film's promise of some serious sexiness: she's soaked whilst washing a car, goes topless during a drunken threesome, flaunts herself in slow motion wearing a semi-translucent swimsuit, and gets it on with Campbell in a swimming pool.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.",Wild Things
9,moonspinner55,Seat-numbing heavy-petter...,3,24 May 2009,"Torrid, preposterous piece of would-be modern noir. Guidance counselor Matt Dillon is accused of raping two female students who look as though they are well-equipped at taking care of themselves--naturally, there's more going on than meets the eye. Lots of plot twists and turns, each one more outlandish than the last. Implausible and ridiculous in the extreme, though the South Florida locations surely help, as do supporting turns by old pros Bill Murray, Robert Wagner, Theresa Russell and Carrie Snodgress. Cinematography by Jeffrey L. Kimball is colorful and expressive, yet the end results are exhausting instead of pleasurable. *1/2 from ****",Wild Things
10,Quinoa1984,One of the best and most stylish mysteries in this generation,8,23 June 2000,"John McNaughton's Wild Things is a stylish thriller that gives new meaning to the term, Kevin's Bacon (just kidding, but that scene tells all).  Story takes more twists than a pretzel factory as a prissy upper class teen (Denis Richards comes great in her breakthrough) accuses a womanizing guidance counselor (Matt Dillon in top form) that he raped her.  It ruins his life, until the plot thickens (among other things thickening).  But seriously, this film is great entertainment with the story having more pzazz that the ending (though the ending is pretty cool too).  Not for kids though.  Bill Murray gives a fine performance as a coniving (and funny) ambulance chaser. A+",Wild Things
11,edwagreen,Wild Things- Wild is the Wind? ***,8,28 March 2013,"The classic tale of wealth, greed, conspiracy, mistrust and the eventual downfall of so many people all mark this 1998 thriller film.The problem with the movie is that there are too many plot twists here. Yes, they're very interesting, but after a while, it becomes who is doing what to whom. Honesty and integrity have all but fallen through the cracks here.Never underestimate the one most deviant. She or he may very well have a brain after-all.Robert Wagner is completely wasted here in a bit part of the rich girl's step-father.

12,preppy-3,Cruel and complex,8,30 June 2000,"Dillon plays a teacher at a school accused of raping a student (Denise Richards)--but did he?  That's only the beginning of a very cruel, extremely complex and VERY entertaining thriller.  There are tons of twists and turns and the movie doesn't take itself seriously for one second.  There's also a fairly explicit sex scene between Dillon, Richards and Neve Campbell. There's also a few shots of Dillon shirtless and full frontal nudity from Kevin Bacon!  Lots of fun and never dull.  Well worth seeing.",Wild Things
13,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Average thriller,6,4 February 2004,"This started out looking very interesting, but it dropped somewhere around the middle, when it stopped being an interesting entertaining thriller, where nothing is as it seems, and dropped to just being filled with more or less nonsensical plot twists. The acting is typical thriller, not very good, nor very bad. The plot started out pretty good, but was soon completely ruined by meaningless twists, that slope very quickly downwards in credibility. A lot of the scenes and twists seemed to just be there, in order for one or more sex scenes, and probably were, too. I'll admit that the sex scenes are pretty good, but they seem to have only one purpose, and that's distracting the viewer from the incredibly unrealistic, unbelievable plot. If it hadn't had so many ridiculous twists, it might have been better, but at the end, the movie just popped out a new twist every couple of seconds or so. I would only recommend this to people who'll watch any thriller, regardless of quality(or lack thereof) or people who want to see lesbian scenes between Neve Campbell and Denise Richards. 6/10",Wild Things
14,view_and_review,They Had Me in the First Half,7,9 November 2020,"So this movie got me. That's something I rarely say. Normally I can predict the arc of a movie with some degree of precision. I was pleasantly fooled watching ""Wild Things."" I knew a lot more remained when the movie seemed to have a conclusion only midway through, but what?Matt Dillon plays a high school guidance counselor named Sam Lombardo. He works at a high school in Blue Bay, Florida and has the girls going crazy for him. His life was turned upside down when one of the students, Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards), accused him of rape. Her charge was buttressed by another high schooler named Suzy (Neve Campbell). When Suzy gave it up that she and Kelly were lying he beat the charge. He then went on to successfully sue Kelly's family and was on to bigger and better things. Or so we thought.This was a torrid steamy movie that was itching for an X rating. The sex and sexual content can be considered superfluous, but then again it did help set up the plot. The plot was such that you couldn't believe anyone nor anything you saw. The drawback to that is that you're expecting to be fooled so when the reveal does happen it's not as shocking. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice... you're not gonna fool me again (to quote George Bush). I enjoyed the divergence from the norm. It wasn't the cleverest plot ever, but it was good.",Wild Things
15,neil-476,Everybody's right!,8,15 April 2008,"Yes, it's lurid. Yes, it's trashy. Yes, it doesn't stand up to close scrutiny. And yes, if you're the sort of person who specialises in spotting plot twists, then you're probably going to do well here.But if you haven't seen this film before, and you're prepared for something a bit on the lurid and trashy side, and you can manage to steer clear of the many spoilers among the reviews here, then you just might find that Wild Things is a fun ride.Because there are, it's true, a number of twists and turns, and not everyone sees them coming.

16,anaconda-40658,Wild and Wet Things.,8,25 May 2015,"Wild Things (1998): Dir: John McNaughton / Cast: Neve Campbell, Denise Richards, Matt Dillon, Kevin Bacon, Bill Murray: Full of double crosses that transpires with manipulation as a school guidance counsellor is accused of raping two girls. He is fired and lands in court. Local police do not believe the girls due to lack of evidence. Clever plotting with nobody pin pointed as who they seem to be. The ads promise sex and seduction and this film delivers in full explicit mode. Director John McNaughton films fetching everglade atmosphere that work for mood and mystery. He previously made the controversial Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. Matt Dillon plays the guidance counsellor who becomes the victim of manipulation. Kevin Bacon plays a hard edge cop investigating the case. Neve Campbell and Denise Richards portray the two girls who may or may not be guilty. Bill Murray steals scenes as a lawyer providing humour as he proceeds to irritate the females on the stand. Screenplay manipulates but mainly to avoid being predictable, which it certainly is not. Some viewers may question whether or not the double crosses play fair within the realms of realism but thankfully it holds strong to elements that have occurred in reality. It presents a strong theme regarding manipulation and how one can be victimized by deceit and lust and other wild things. Score: 8 / 10",Wild Things
17,The_Void,"Seductive, slick and sexy; great entertainment!",8,6 May 2006,"Wild Things is a fantastic example of what can be achieved by not worrying about substance and having a film play for straight entertainment value. Here we have a film that takes elements such as beautiful stars, beautiful locations and a bucket load of plot twists and blends it all into a highly enjoyable film experience. Of course, Wild Things doesn't always come across very realistically and, at times even, it's downright ridiculous; but it's done in such a way that it doesn't matter, and because of that we have a film that can do what it wants. The film is helmed by John McNaughton, who had his first success with the cult horror flick Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer. It has to be said that the scene setting and way that the plot moves is somewhat ham-fisted, as sometimes it's painfully obvious that certain sections of the film exist only to give it another selling point; the argument that starts out between Denise Richards and Neve Campbell beside a swimming pool being a case in point. However, McNaughton makes good of these selling points, and for every three way sex scene and absurd plot twist, the film gains an extra point for trashy entertainment value.It's not immediately obvious what Wild Things is going to be about, as the first twenty minutes serve only in setting the scene and from that base, the film could easily turn into any teenage school flick. However, it turns out that this time is well used; as by nulling the audience into a false sense of security, the film is able to make sure that every twist comes as a surprise. The film benefits from a great big name cast, which is anchored by Matt Dillon; who gives one of his best performances. Dillon clearly enjoys himself, and his persona is able to suit both the sleazy and upstanding nature of his character. Kevin Bacon sleepwalks and isn't really able to show his true talent, and similarly Neve Campbell looks out of place (sexy with it) in her role as a teenage junkie. However, Denise Richards rounds the piece of nicely with a charged performance and the ensemble is nicely topped off by the likes of Bill Murray, Theresa Russell and Robert Wagner. The settings that the movie takes place in look great, and ensure that there's more eye candy than just the female leads. Director McNaughton presents a fabulously mysterious atmosphere which obviously bodes well with the plot and, on the whole, if you want a couple of hours of entertainment; you can do a lot, lot worse than this twisty little flick.",Wild Things
18,Sylviastel,Wild Things is truly wild!,7,13 June 2006,"Matt Dillon is brilliant in his role as a guidance counselor who is accused of raping his students or is he. Anyway Kevin Bacon is also brilliant as the police detective in charge of an investigation of murder. Neve Campbell has a strong unusual role as a brilliant but trapped in a blue collar life. Denise Richards who I never saw before is above average in her part. The plot is not easy and you have to watch it to the end to get it but you're left with more questions than answers anyway which is why I am giving it a seven. I love Carrie Snodgress who plays Ruby in this film. I think she is brilliant actress who does a fantastic job with her small part. Of course, I won't reveal anymore regarding the plot because you have to watch it for yourself. It's not an easy plot with lots of twists and turns. In the end, they show the scenes that we don't see and it helps explain what really happens and that does help answer some questions. I can't forget Bill Murray who has a small role in this film as well. Of course, I would like to ask the director lots of questions about this film but that's not going to happen.",Wild Things
19,christopher-underwood,craziness during and after main credits,8,4 November 2017,"Hadn't seen this for a very long time so the twists and turns had me going all over again. Watched the longer, import version, which has a bit more sex but more importantly more plot exposition, just to help those twists nicely along. Matt Dillon is as good as I have seen him in anything and the two young women, played by Denise Richards and Neve Campbell are perfect. As a bonus we have a wonderful, underplayed of course, performance from Bill Murray. Looks good with solid cinematography and direction and I was surprised how good the dialogue is.

22,JamesHitchcock,Let's Twist Again,3,29 May 2009,"There are certain films which have become famous on account of one sexually provocative scene. ""From Here to Eternity"" is an excellent film, which deserves to be remembered for many things, but it lives on in the public imagination as the film where Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr make love on the beach, even though that scene only occupies a short part of the film's running time. Similarly, ""The Seven Year Itch"" is remembered mostly for Marilyn's skirt billowing around her legs. And ""Wild Things"", of course, is best known for That Kiss between Denise Richards and Neve Campbell, although to be honest it has so few intrinsic merits that it deserves to be remembered for little else. Sam Lombardo, a Florida high school guidance counsellor, is accused of rape by a female student, Kelly Van Ryan, the wild daughter of a wealthy family. Things start to look bad for Lombardo when a second student, Suzie Toller, comes forward to say that has also raped her. Lombardo is arrested and engages a lawyer named Kenneth Bowden to represent him. (Is it a coincidence that Lombardo has the same Christian name as, and his lawyer the same surname as, the hero of ""Cape Fear"", another thriller set in the American South and which also involved allegations of rape?) When I started watching this film, I had no idea of the plot (except that it involved two girls kissing) and at this point I was still assuming that it would be either a traditional courtroom thriller or an ""issue"" movie about sexual abuse, but it turns out to be neither. There is an unexpected turn of events during the trial. Under cross-examination Suzie reveals that Lombardo did not rape her and that Kelly, who has a grudge against the counsellor, persuaded Suzie to join her in fabricating charges against him. Lombardo is triumphantly acquitted. Now I have long learnt to be wary of crime films which involve the sudden and unexpected acquittal of the defendant about halfway though, as this is generally a sign that a major plot twist is in the offing, the twist normally being that the supposedly innocent man is in reality as guilty as hell, if not of the crime of which he was accused then of some other felony. (There was a twist of this nature in ""Just Cause"", another nineties thriller set in southern Florida). And so it proves here. Following his acquittal Lombardo brings a lawsuit seeking compensation and is awarded $8.5 million. The twist proves to be that he, Suzie and Kelly planned the entire incident in order to split the compensation money between them. That, however, is not the end of the story. Ray Duquette, the police officer who investigated the original rape allegations, becomes suspicious of Lombardo, and keeps him under observation. Moreover, this is not the end of the twists either. Most ""twist thrillers"" only have one main plot twist. Some, like ""Reindeer Games"", have two. ""Wild Things"" has so many that I lost count. The whole of the second half of the movie amounted to little more than one twist after another. I haven't got space (or the inclination) to list them all here, although they all involve variants on the two most popular twists, namely:-1. That a character believed to be dead is in fact alive, and 2. That a character believed to be a hero is in fact a villain. Denise Richards will never be my favourite actress; her performance in ""The World is Not Enough"" means that she must go down as one of the worst Bond girls of all times. Nevertheless, her looks and her combination of innocence and sensuality make her just right for the role of the wanton rich girl Kelly (even if, at 27, she was about a decade older than the character she was supposed to be playing). Neve Campbell was also convincing as the sluttish white-trash Suzie, but few of the other actors make much impression; the likes of Kevin Bacon, Theresa Russell and Robert Wagner are all capable of much better work than this. The real problem, however, is not with the acting but with the plot. The result of all the twists is a plot which has been twisted out of all recognition. The story, at least on a first viewing, is virtually incomprehensible, even with the assistance of a series of flashbacks intercut with the closing credits. Eventually the viewer may realise what is supposed to have happened, but this does not help much, as it means that the film simply becomes incredible rather than incomprehensible. One of the characters- I won't say which- has devised a scheme to dispose of all the others, a scheme of such baroque complexity that it bears no relation to the way in which any real human being, even the most fiendish criminal, would behave in real life. Films like this one serve little purpose other than to show off the supposed cleverness of the director and scriptwriters. Comparisons to the work of Alfred Hitchcock, a noted student of psychology, and to the best films noirs, which have a much more realistic view of human nature, seem to me to be very wide of the mark. ""Wild Things""- I don't think I love you. 3/10 (2/10 for the story, with a bonus point for That Kiss).",Wild Things

24,=G=,What a croc!,6,1 August 2003,"In ""Wild Things"", B-flick director McNaughton manages to wrest some lame performances from a pretty good cast while telling a convoluted story about a couple of babes (Richards/Campbell)  who accuse their school guidance counselor (Dillon) of rape. A conspiracy flick set in sweaty swampy Florida with everything but the proverbial kitchen sink tossed in, the only question this flick raises is which of the many predictable conclusions was selected. Full of twists and turns, ""Wild Things"" is best watched with the brain disengaged so each switchback will come as a surprise and the mind can just zone on the titillators. An okay couch potato guy flick, those who want more info should check Ebert's review as he nailed this one. Be sure to watch through the closing credits for more scenes. (C+)",Wild Things

26,FeastMode,as trashy as some of its characters,2,26 May 2020,"This movie made me laugh at how basic, trashy and blatant it was. there is no finesse in anything it tries. the story has some good ideas, but there are many plot holes and things that don't really make sense. character don't make sense either. it's all just madness (about 2 viewings, 5/25/2020)",Wild Things
27,ElMaruecan82,Delightfully Sleazy and Trashy Florida Noir...,8,21 October 2018,"Seriously, how much more ""noir"" could John McNaughton's ""Wild Things"" be?To call it ""noir"" is in fact an understatement, the film features such a trashy gallery of characters that it would be a miracle to keep faith on mankind after watching it... had the movie taken itself too seriously, but smartly enough, it hadn't. ""Wild Things"" is just a big ""joke"" of a thriller wrapped up in deliberate sleaze and soft-core package, and it works. Oh yeah, it does.It's been almost 20 years that I watched the film, I visualize my friend urging me to watch the VHS tape, he knew I was a fan of twisted movies with labyrinthine plots, those were the times of FHM magazine and when Internet was still marginal enough so the sight of a bikini or a bare-chested woman was enough to arouse our senses... and with stars such as Denise Richards and Neve Campbell, ""Wild Things"" was the offer we couldn't refuse.Watching it again at almost twice the age I was the first time, I'm surprised by how much I enjoyed it. It was even more fun to see the reaction of my brother who never heard about it, who grew up with the TV series and far more intricate plots than I and yet didn't see anything coming. Yep, that might be a relic of old-school cinema, no artsy sequence shots, no ominous close-ups or fancy dialogues, just a film with a plot as thick and tense as heat before a storm.Speaking of heat, it's all fitting that the story is set in Florida. During the day, it's sunny, warm and welcoming like a postcard tropical paradise or a ""Miami Vice"" establishing shot; at night, the colorful bikinis are long gone and the place becomes the twin sister of New Orleans with menacing alligators and scary yet sometimes conveniently disposed swamps. Blue Bay mirrors the soul of the film's characters, summed up by detective Ray Duquette (Kevin Bacon): ""People aren't always what they appear to be.""And this quotes overarches almost every single action in the film, it's all about intentions, plots, schemes, deceptions where every single anticipation or prediction is toyed with and every 'normal' reaction is twisted. After a murder, a girl says ""My mom would kill me if she knew I took the Rover"", and it's the same rich and powerful mother who's enraged by the fact her daughter was raped... in Blue Bay. And as if they wanted to embrace the sleaziness of their characters, the manipulative writers gratify us with soft-core sex when we expect a cat-fight. Still, if the plot is utterly ridiculous, it's intense, sensual and perfectly executed.There is Matt Dillon as Sam Lombardo the high school counselor and the rich, sexy, spoiled and manipulative Denise Richards as Kelly Van Ryan, daughter of Theresa Russell, who waves at Sam from the balcony wearing an open gown and a bikini... like mother, like daughter. In the opposite end of the spectrum, there's Neve Campbell as Suzie Toller, the trailer trash punk whose establishing moment consists on leaving a conference about sex crimes when Sam had just introduced Ray and his partner (Daphne Rubin Vega).It's interesting that the first scene introduces every single player of the game, and the only hint it leaves will be useless by the time the plot starts with its pivotal point: an accusation of rape. This case leads to introduce the last player of the film, Bill Murray in one of his most underrated role as a more competent version of Lionel Hutz. Like all the other characters, he embodies the notion that you shouldn't trust what you see, only in the most mundane way: he wears a brace to fool an insurance man, he calls his secretary with an interphone while she's just behind the glass and behind his own jovial ""glass"", he's more cunning than he seems.At that point of the review, there's no need to pursue, the film had a way to grab you by the heart, the eyes (and maybe something else) and take you to one hell of a conspiracy plot. Yes, we know there's something fishy, but we can only follow the characters one discovery after another, some of them contained in hot and steamy eroticism. But sex isn't gratuitous, it's crucial because it represents the one weakness that makes everyone commit their mistakes, that's the irony of the whole ""Wild Thing"" scheme, it's about a perfect crime undermined by the way people can yield to temptation, be entrapped by their hubris, or have their ego manipulated.It's the collision of something deemed to succeed in the name of greed and lust but deemed to fail in the name of their aftermaths, and guess what? even with these parameters in mind, the ending is unpredictable and doesn't follow any pattern. The film is pure neo-noir trashy B-movie material but its conclusion has a strange power, it leaves a weird smile on your face with the idea that you actually liked it, and you'd be glad to make someone discover it. That's what prompted my friend to give me the tape and actually, he was glad to watch it again with me, I wonder if it was to see MY reactions or to admire the beautiful sight of Denise Richards. I guess a little bit of both.One more thing, ""Wild Things"" is a forgotten little gem of 1998 with cell-phones as big as laptops and where Internet was still utilitarian, the same plot would be impossible ten years later with the new technology... so it was perfect timing. The old-fashioned neo-noir cult-classic holds up quite well today, better than ""Showgirls"" anyway. Yes, there's good trash and bad trash.Maybe it's too pervert for some people's tastes, speaking for myself, I don't know what's mort pervert in the sexual material or the storytelling devices. I enjoyed both anyway.",Wild Things
28,paul2001sw-1,Wildly bad,3,21 May 2004,"'Wild Things' is a hard film to comment on, basically because it is two films; or at least, one film in disguise.  It commences as an ""issue-based"" melodrama, except that two things seem odd: the pacing is too fast (how is the story going to last the movie?) and the bizarre score seems more fitted to a comedy.  Sure enough, this ""straight"" drama is wrapped up, only to subside into a larger thriller; a thriller in which twists and turns of the plot come at an ever faster rate, until in the end the film's aim is clearly to make you gasp rather than care (this is particularly evident when the missing holes in the plot are explained through the perfunctory insertion of extra scenes into the closing credits).  So, to assess it we need to ask: what's the quality of the initial set-up; how good is the twisty thriller; and how well is the transition handled?  In fact, the same answer pretty much covers all three bases: badly.  The initial drama is based around a high school teacher accused of sexual abuse. A potentially interesting situation, but presented in an absurd manner: the teacher seems terrified from the start that the moment he is alone with a girl, she'll fall out of her bra for him (and it's the kind of film where a lot of falling out of bras goes on); and sure enough, the moment that it happens, the girl in question (inevitably gorgeous) is accusing him of rape (and her evil mother is trying to run him out of town).  One might suggest that one is meant to smell a rat as a lead in to the film's later development; but it's not just the details of the situation that ring false, but the portrayal of the whole world (when the girl, for example, first gives a statement, one policewoman suspects her of lying from the start, but never tells her colleagues (or us) why - indeed, all police work seems to proceed by arbitrary pronouncement at all points).The twistier second half doesn't work either, in part because the first part proved so shallow; as none of the characters are likely or believable, who the hell cares if they aren't what they seem?  As the twists mount, the whole thing feels more like a parody of a David Mamet film; one can only suppose that it's meant to be humourous, but there's no humour beyond the outlines of the plot.  And the film's final joke depends entirely on the audience's prior relationship with Bill Murray; otherwise it simply makes no sense.On the way to this disappointing end, it manages to commit most of the sins typical of films aimed at the teenaged market: gross materialism, gratuitous profanity and titillation, the insensitive intrusion of popular music in almost every scene, wafer thin characterisation and the complete absence of real insight into the human condition.  In its defence, the brisk telling of the complex story ensures that, however shallow, 'Wild Things' isn't boring. But it is flimsy, exploitative entertainment hiding under the thinnest veneer of pretension. Avoid unless you've truly nothing worthwhile to do.",Wild Things
29,bowmanblue,They'll make your heart sing,10,6 June 2015,"'Wild Things' is a classic. It deserves its top marks. Of course, in the history of cinema it probably won't be talked about in the same terms as other 'classics,' such as The Godfather and Empire Strikes Back. 'Wild Things' is a different type of film for a different type of audience.It's a twisty-turny thriller where you can't really say too much about the plot without giving away important information that is best left kept secret until you actually watch it. Basically, it involves plenty of glamorous (and murderous!) back-stabbing, by beautiful people in beautiful locations. If you've watched the trailer (and I suggest you don't, seeing as that too gives away more than you really need to know) then you'll see that there's a strong 'sexual element' to it. Therefore, critics can easily dismiss the film as just some (slightly classier) p0rn and leave it at that.Yes, sex is an important part of 'Wild Things,' but, like I say, it's so much more than that. Matt Dillon, Kevin Bacon, Neve Campbell are all great, but, for me, the stand-out performances come from Denise Richards and Bill Murray. Murray normally turns in an excellent performance in whatever he does, so you'll probably expect it from him. However, since Wild Things, Denise Richards has taken more than her fair share of criticism concerning her acting abilities. I can tell you though she shines here (and I'm not just talking 'visually!') and even gets what I would say is the best line of the film – something about 'taking the car,' but you'll have to watch the film to see the context she uses it in.If you're not offended by plenty of sex in a film and you like your films with more plot twists in than a filmic corkscrew, then give Wild Things a go. Just be sure to sit through the credits for added scenes which explain a lot of what's happened (when I first saw this in the cinema, I noticed that some people actually left the moment the screen went black – they really missed out!). Also, don't watch the sequels – I mean it – just don't. They're basically the same film, only done worse and if you've seen the original you'll have seen it much better.",Wild Things
30,bowmanblue,So much more than you've (probably) heard,10,27 February 2020,"I'm not sure whether 'Wild Things' was a commercial hit when it was first released back in 1998 or not. The critics seem to hate it, calling it 'trash' and 'soft p0rn.' Whereas it soon developed a cult audience - many going to see it because its marketing played heavily on nude scenes from (then hot property) Denise Richards and various lesbian love scenes (spoiler: there isn't that much lesbianism contained within).So, many people said it made money because it was effectively soft p0rn (and remember, this film was released before the internet became mainstream - nowadays anything found in 'Wild Things' is absolutely tame compared to what shows up on Google!). Perhaps that aspect helped sell the movie. However, it's so much more than just idle schoolboys' fantasies.I'll be deliberately vague about the film's plot, because anything too detailed will give away major spoilers for what's to come. It's more of a thriller, with a healthy dose of murder/mystery and - of course - some sexual scenes thrown in there, but - again - I stress not as many as you may think, based on the film's reception back in the day.There's so many twists in this film that you may actually have to pay attention to what's happening (even when the performers have their clothes on!). And that's the film's true selling point - it's story. It's one of those films where you can only ever watch it once and enjoy the fact that you don't know where it's going. The four main actors (Kevin Bacon, Matt Dillon, Denise Richards and Neve Campbell) all shine in their respective roles as they fight for money, greed and (in some cases) love.Yes, if you probably held every aspect of the plot up to extreme scrutiny then it may require some suspension of disbelief in some places, but doesn't every film these days? It's fun. It's trashy, but overall it's a very cleverly-written story and the initial negative feedback it received shouldn't be what your opinion is based on.Oh, and I forget to mention that even Bill Murray is in it. It's only now 'Breaking Bad' has come and gone that I think Murray's character could well be a distant relative to 'Breaking Bad's' 'Saul' in terms of dodgy lawyers. Murray's not one of the main quartet of characters, but he steals every scene he's in.",Wild Things

Then, when it aired on cable I just watched if for the infamous but glorious threesome sex scene. I mean, who wouldn't like to watch the incredibly hot Denise Richards kissing Neve Campbell? I enjoyed it but didn't care for the plot. Bad mistake. But those kind of errors happen when you sell the movie only for a sex scene. Anyways...Years later I decided to watch it when I caught it on cable. It's a teen thriller with an edge and some good dramatic plot twists. Matt Dillon is a very good actor and exploits his talent here. Neve Campbell is also a fine actress and I'm glad she decided to take this sexy role. Denise Richards steals the show mainly because of her beauty and sex appeal.Watch this movie if you are into Teen Thrillers. This one is spicy and overall good.",Wild Things

33,GOWBTW,Can't get any wilder than this!,9,9 May 2005,"This movie lets people get into the action of everything! It's got a great cast, a great plot, and full of suspense and intrigue. Denise Richards is H.O.T., HOT! Very sultry when she got wet after washing her teacher's jeep. Her mom is hot too. And don't forget Neve Campbell, she was hot when she was involved in the love triangle with Richards and Matt Dillon. In my opinion, this movie should be titled ""The Greed Game"" however that title wouldn't stick. There's ""The Grifters"" another movie about manipulation. Bill Murray did a spectacular job at playing the lawyer for Matt Dillon's character. He never got harmed in the movie. This has a touch of Hitchcock to it. I think if Alfred Hitchcock was still alive, he would watch it too. It's like a chess game, but only one person can have the prize. Watch this movie, you'll get yourself hooked.

34,jtindahouse,Denise Richards Stunning!!!,10,21 September 2004,"Magnificent storyline. While the basic storyline of what was happening was so simple it was so original as well. All the twists and turns kept you interested throughout the movie which is what people really want to see from a movie, not something that drags on and on about nothing and then finishes with the same kind of ending that every other movie does. Neve Campbell played a different type of role to what she's used to but did it very well. Matt Dillon (playing Sam Lambardo) was excellent although the role could have been cast slightly better maybe with George Clooney. Kevin Bacon gave another stellar performance and kept you interested in his role throughout the movie. But without a doubt the the best performance was Denise Richards who was absolutely perfect for the role. She couldn't have been cast better from anyone in the world. Her beauty made this movie what it was. I think a lot of people would consider Matt Dillon the luckiest man in the world.",Wild Things
35,elshikh4,When Basic Insect Rules !,6,25 April 2008,"""Thriller, with so many twists, graphic sex scenes, some good scenery, and maybe a vendetta against rich people.. So why not?!"". Sure the producers loved that approach. It got the word ""commercial"" all over it!Actually, this movie is candid to a respectable extent; explicitly they wrote the word SEX on the board at the first scene! It's the human greed, instinct, impurity as wild things. But maybe it tried to say something extra.If you tired to philosophize it, it gave you chances: we're living a rotten world where the instinct's needs rule. The society's values became lower and lower, since the investigators as well as the defenders of the truth; like the officer and the lawyer, are investigating and defending money only. There is no perfect truth; only detached pieces of it. Greed can make the human a real beast with evil brain and no mercy.. etc.Plus, the movie is catchy, solid, and darkly sarcastic. It pulled off being not stupid or hyped; which destroyed any similar movies, like for instance Basic (2004).So what's the problem?!, what's here to make the critic criticize? Well, the performance was cold, rather fake, especially from Denise Richards and Matt Dillon sides. Add to that, the bad feelings that this movie leaves you with, intentionally or unintentionally, about the illusion of the trust, the dominion of depravity, the end of goodness or at least its weakness. Or the fact that after (Basic Insect - 1992) crime movies used to hackney and degrade their good issues to act immorally, and be sexually trite and perverted.Thus, if its substance is about living a rotten world where the instinct's needs rule; then this applies to Hollywood world also. Because it's all about wild things done in a wild way, where morals are being beaten in the movie, and by it too.The 1990s inaugurated a new age, where ""commercial"" had to be wild, if not too wild, and it is scary if you give it a little thinking.",Wild Things

While they are two detectives on the cast (Kevin Bacon and Daphne Rubin-Vega), they find out there's more than meets the eye in the mystery of deceit, sex and greed.Directed by John Mc Naughton (Herny:Portrait of a Serial Killer, Lansky, Normal Life) made an entertaining trashy noir that has an unique blend of sex, suspense, comedy and a twisted story. An terrific cast makes things enjoyable, which included:Theresa Russell, Robert Wagner and Bill Murray. This film wasn't much of a hit, when it was first released in the spring of 1998. But it turned into a cult hit on video. The Unrated DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. The Unrated DVD adds seven minutes of additional footage, which it has some good moments...especially during the end credits and the characters are more fleshed-out in the Unrated DVD. ""Wild Things"" has an good moody music score by George S. Clinton (Austin Powers Trilogy) and striking camera work by Jeffery L. Kimball (Jacob's Ladder, Stigmata, True Romance) are one of the highlights of this guilty pleasure film. Bacon is also the film's executive producer.

To put it NOT so charitably, it is a stupid, sour spirited, self-indulgent piece of filmaking that doesn't seem to have a clue what it wants to achieve. Anyone with an IQ above average will find their intelligence insulted. To even attempt to describe the plot would be out of the question. It is difficult to summarize, because it keeps changing the rules of the game on us. With one silly twist after another, Wild Things becomes increasingly difficult to invest in. Its lack of focus is aggravating, yet the movie is so in love with itself that it will try anything. It takes forever to end, and even when it does, and we see the words 'THE END' on the screen, the movie throws a little extra material in there (supposedly flashbacks).

45,lemon_magic,"Lovely to look at, heaven to touch...it's a real shame it has to sleaze so much!",6,5 June 2005,"I think the directors, screenwriters and actors involved in this sleazy tale were going for the feel of a noir thriller by a writer like James M. Cain or Jim Thompson. They also seemed to be trying to mix in some of the arch wit and cynicism of an Alfred Hitchcock movie or a Lawrence Block ""Burglar"" novel. However, they pretty much missed the mark with the last objective, and the first two have already been done quite well by films such as 'Body Heat' and 'Miami Blues', so 'Wild Things' ends up looking a bit shabby by comparison.The problem is the nature of the story material. Noir thrillers always have two overriding themese: 1) ""People (Especially Women) Are No Damned Good (CRIME)"" and 2) ""Instant Karma's Gonna Get Ya Every Time (PUNISHMENT)"". A noir movie has to incorporate these two themes in new and unpredictable ways, and ""Wild Things"" simply thrashes around too much in an attempt to do something new while it moves from the CRIME theme to the PUNISHMENT. Trying not to be derivative, the story ends up exhausting the viewer's patience. A master plotter like Loren Estleman could have streamlined this puppy and simplified it while preserving the 'wheels with wheels' factor going, but the screenplay here just doesn't know when to say 'WHEN'. And there's the matter of taste and restraint, of which 'Wild Things' has none. Keep in mind that Cain and Thompson had plenty of sleazy, trashy, sociopath characters in their books, and it took considerable care and taste to bring their plots to a movie without overloading the Sleaze Meter and making the viewer loathe and despise everybody in the story. But somewhere in the process of making this film, the director lost control and let the whole thing lurch over into ""I Hate Every Major Character In This Film"" territory. I think I hit my gag limit with the totally gratuitous nude shower shot of Kevin Bacon. It didn't add a thing to the story, and was obviously just there to expose yet another acre of flesh to the camera. All of my quibbles with this film are really with the screenplay. I think the actors are all high level pros who do what they do really well...it's just that the movie requires them to play repellent characters. And boy, are they repellent! In defense of Denise Richards, no she can't act, but she never really is given a chance to act, in this film or most others. Film makers just use her as a Barbie Doll with nice boobs and striking eyebrows - kind of like the 2nd coming of Brooke Shields. That is again the case here. I think that it is still possible that Richards could go the route of Jennifer Connelly and eventually do credit to some 'real' actresses roles...If she is ever given the chance.And the movie LOOKS great. Wonderful scenery, lighting, camera work and production values. However, when you have to use this as a defense for a movie's quality, you are basically admitting that the problems with acting or direction or storyline are insupportable. I am not saying you shouldn't see this movie...you just have to be in the right mood to enjoy it. If I had to described the internal criteria a viewer needed in order to enjoy this movie, he or she would be saying to them self: ""I'd like to watch something like 'Body Heat', or ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", but it doesn't have to be as good.""",Wild Things
46,philip_vanderveken,"All in all it was a very promising movie, but the many twists just made it too complicated and unbelievable.",6,10 November 2004,"Let's be honest: the only reason why men watch this movie is because Denise Richards and Neve Campbell are in it. Too bad for the girls, although I guess they don't mind Matt Damon is in it as well. Isn't there another reason to watch this movie then? Well, I don't think it will be the story, because there are so many twists in it that it is almost impossible to keep following it. The only other reason I can come up with to watch this movie must be the many erotic scenes (Richards and Campbell kissing in the pool and in a car, a threesome between Campbell, Richards and Damon,...). Wild Things is about Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards), a rich snob, who accuses the school guidance counselor, Sam Lombardo (Matt Dillon) of raping her. The police starts an investigation and they soon find another victim. Suzie Toller (Neve Campbell) is a poor, drug using girl that lives in a trailer. She attends the same school and she claims to be raped by Lombardo as well. However, during the trial she appears to be lying. She admits that it is just a trick to punish Mr. Lombardo because he has let her down once and that Van Ryan is in it as well. So far so good, but then the movie starts to twist and turn so often that it makes it very hard to keep understanding what is actually happening. All the good people appear to be bad; the victims are in a conspiracy with the criminal, but so are many other people; murders are being committed like if it is nothing... It's just one huge mess. I guess the only reason why people keep watching until the end is because they are expecting even more steaming sex scenes. All in all it was a very promising movie, but the many twists just made it too complicated and unbelievable. On the other hand, I'm only a man with a healthy dose of hormones... I give this movie a 6/10. It's the best I can do.",Wild Things
47,Gislef,Hitchcock meets MTV,6,21 September 1999,"It's not really that worthy of the Master, but it's got a few decent twists and turns.  I didn't think it had that much sex/nudity (three, maybe four scenes over 108 minutes).  Actually, I thought the twists were kinda telegraphed a bit much:  it's one of those movies where about a minute before the shoe drops, you realize, ""Hey, it must be [Person X]!""  Hitchcock wouldn't have done that.Bill Murray is hilarious, and Kevin Bacon is okay.  I wasn't overly impressed by anyone else.  The insertion of the scenes at the end is probably the best part.  Most of it is unnecessary, but at we least we find out how the baddie is going to get at the money at the end.",Wild Things

But it's one of those movies I've watched several times as a teen. And rewatching it today, it's still very satisfying.

51,seymourblack-1,"Intriguing, Humorous & Outrageously Twisted",8,23 September 2013,"This highly entertaining sleaze-fest features gratuitous nudity, bi-sexuality and a ménage-a-trois which all seem to have been included purely to spice things up. It's also, however, a glossy thriller with an extremely well written plot that's intriguing, humorous and outrageously twisted. Remarkably, by the time all the explanatory flashbacks (which are included with the closing credits) have finished, it's also evident that the whole thing makes sense. Greed, betrayal and murder are the story's main ingredients but the sheer wickedness of its characters and the movie's satirical qualities also combine well to ensure that ""Wild Things"" compares favourably to most other crime-related mysteries that may be on offer.Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards) is a spoilt, 17-year-old rich girl who lives in Blue Bay, Florida. She's used to getting everything she wants but when she sets her sights on her High School guidance counsellor, Sam Lombardo (Matt Dillon), things don't fall into place as easily as she expects and she accuses him of rape. Local police detectives Ray Duquette (Kevin Bacon) and Gloria Perez (Daphne Rubin-Vega) are charged with the responsibility of investigating the alleged crime and Perez is certainly not convinced that there is any substance in Kelly's accusation.When another girl, Suzie Toller (Neve Campbell) also comes forward and makes a similar accusation, Sam Lombardo is arrested and hires lawyer Kenneth Bowden (Bill Murray) to defend him. Kelly's mother Sandra (Theresa Russell) is very wealthy and powerful and also one of Sam's ex-lovers. She's delighted to use the situation to try to ruin Sam but after the case against him collapses in bizarre circumstances and Lombardo is awarded a multi-million dollar settlement for defamation of character, Sandra Van Ryan is left furious and humiliated and looking for revenge. The course that the story takes from this point on is full of twists and double-crosses that keep on coming until the movie eventually ends with the most surprising development of them all.The characters in ""Wild Things"" include the very rich and the very poor as well as people who are employed in the legal profession, education and law enforcement. What they all have in common is that they're all morally bankrupt and most of them are criminals. The way in which they're represented on-screen is brilliant as the acting is pitched at just the right amount over-the-top to exploit the absurdity and humour of so many of the situations without allowing the impact of the more scandalous and wicked goings-on to be diminished in any way. In this respect, the entire cast is top-notch but Bill Murray does particularly well as a shyster lawyer who enjoys a good insurance scam but is also smarter than he first appears to be.""Wild Things"" is beautifully filmed and some passages of the score wouldn't have seemed out of place in ""Twin Peaks"". It's tremendous fun to watch and very rewarding because it delivers so much more that it initially seems to promise.",Wild Things
52,inspectors71,"Garbage In, Garbage Out",3,4 May 2016,"17 years after seeing Wild Things, my memory is pretty sketchy, much the same as the movie. All I can recall is that there were some interesting plot twists and turns that kept me watching. The story of a detective--Kevin Bacon, I think--involved in something or another about murder and a guidance counselor--Matt Dillon?--and two nymphets-- Neve Campbell and Denise Richards--and, oh, whatever. The only reason people, er, guys watch this movie is to see Campbell and Richards having sex. Wild Things is raunchy, but it has just enough skill in the storytelling that it isn't purely soft porn.If you're not terribly interested in letting the mutt in your brain pan lick himself (Stop that, Rover!) while watching the two gals ""kiss and make up,"" you may find Wild Things marginally interesting, although it gets off (sorry) to a very weak start that telegraphs that much of the film's focus is below the belt.Funny story: At the recent White House Correspondents' Dinner, Fox News' Jesse Watters was interviewing Neve Campbell and brought up the pool scene with Denise Richards and her. She got a snarky grin on her face and said something like ""It figures you'd like that.""I'm no prude, but was that a slam at Watters or conservatives or just guys in general?My mutt would respond but he's busy.",Wild Things

Then it's interesting because for one time we have a movie that shows elite as lusty and corrupter instead of being our constant models! At last, we have the sex issues: indeed, it's a Hollywood production that features all tastes and mixes and one more time, we don't have the usual content as here it's very graphic! For sure, Denise Richards is really exciting with her greats tits and crazy curves: the pool scene was a favorite in the beginning of Internet! In a way, for me, this movie hunts on the same territory as Showgirls (same new level on nudity, Hollywood stars and dream not that so pure and angelic) and it's not a surprise that both Denise and Dillon would later work with Verhoeven because we find the same vibes.",Wild Things
54,RNMorton,Only if you're in that mood,8,25 April 2003,"For mindless entertainment, then it's perfect. If you're looking for a challenging detective puzzle go elsewhere. But if you're up for a modern film noir mood movie, with great musical backing, and not too worried trying to sort things out at the end, then sit back and relax. I wrote a scathing review of this ten years + ago, I've lightened up since then. Enjoy.
*spoiler* Fine cast in gritty story of teacher wrongly (?) accused of sleeping with students and resulting defamation case. There are only two very real problems - 1) everybody that matters is a dirtball, and 2) by the time you get to the third or fourth ""shocking surprise"" it just doesn't make sense anymore. Oh, and a third thing, the wrap-up is pretty unpleasant. Movie tries to redeem its credibility by giving you final flashback scenes that are supposed to explain the many twists in the storyline, but they actually explain very little and only highlight the falseness of the earlier script. Funny part is, this would have been entertaining if a portion of the plot (you pick the portion) had been played straight. As it is it's just attractive junk. 6 out of 10 is probably too much but I'm sticking with it...",Wild Things
55,baumer,One of the sexiest movies I've seen,8,18 August 1999,"I admired Basic Instinct for being sexy.  Every nude scene that was in that film was done so to further the plot, deepen a character or play with someone's mind.  I enjoyed it for those reasons.  Wild Things has none of that.  When there is nudity or sexy scenes in here it has nothing to do with furthering the plot, it was gratuitous nudity.  It was to get men into the audience and holler at the gorgeous women on screen.  And I loved it for that.  There are not that many movies that dare to stoop to that level to sell tickets anymore.  Wild Things does and makes no apologies for it.There are so many plot twists in here that when you are not watching Denise Richards get wet and get into a menage a trois, you are engaged by the story.  And it never stops moving.  It always has something new that you are shocked at just when you think there is nothing more to figure out. Especially entertaining in this film is Bill Murray as a sleazy attorney and his secretary.  She had me in stitches at times.  Especially bad is Theresa Russell.  I have never thought of her as a good actress and I think she got by on nepotism for her whole career.  Here she whines and has no idea how to play her part.  I really can't believe that they didn't try to replace her with another actress.  But if you can stomach her for the brief time that she is on screen then you should enjoy the rest of this film.The very end of the film was a shocker to me.  Don't turn the VCR off until the credits have completely stopped rolling.  Here you will see some of the best stuff in the film and it will explain to you alot of what it is that you need to know.Wild Things is a great film, more so for guys for obvious reasons but even for women who like a good story, this will please you as well.It's not often that a film will blatantly use sex to sell their film, it seems like the glory days of the 80's are gone.  But this restores my faith in pointless nudity, and if you like this sort of thing, then you will really enjoy this film.",Wild Things

The main characters, Bacon, Dillon, Campbell, and Richards turn in excellent performances, as does Bill Murray as a sleazy lawyer.

60,bellino-angelo2014,Decent thriller to not take too seriously,7,16 February 2020,"As I wrote in few other reviews I am not a huge fan of thrillers but some surprise because of the plot or originality. While WILD THINGS didn't surprised me it was still ok.When the movie begins, high school conselour Sam Lombardo (Matt Dillon) is accused of rape by female students Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards) and Suzie Toller (Neve Campbell). Soon Sam asks his lawyer Ken Bowden (Bill Murray) to help him. At the trial we discover why the two students accused Sam of rape: Suzie since he failed to bail her out of jail and Kelly since he had an affair with her mother. In the meanwhile Police Sergeant Ray Duquette (Kevin Bacon) investigates the possible scam between Sam and the girls but after some killings and Ray is dismissed from the police, everyone except Suzie dies and the movie ends with her that she receives a briefcase full of money by Bowden and she rides towards the sunset.As I wrote in the summary this is a movie to not be taken too seriously because if you think too much your head might explode! However it has some pros. It has very bright cinematography and nice sets that make you want to go where the movie was filmed. The performances by Matt Dillon, Bill Murray and Neve Campbell are decent; while Kevin Bacon at times overacts terribly, Denise Richards gives a very lazy performance. The soundtrack is probably the best asset of the movie in my opinion.In substance, not a great movie by all means but still a good thriller with nice surprises and twists and turns galore. Just a time passer and nothing more.",Wild Things
61,Maziun,Sex is the only real reason to watch it,4,15 September 2013,"*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS*SPOILERS ""Wild things"" is a trash entertainment , but an enjoyable entertainment . It isn't great on any kind of level . Still , it provides a quite decent entertainment for nearly 2 hours. It's better than most of the movies in its genre - erotic thriller (not that the genre has about 2 really good movies in it , while the rest is basically a straight-to-video/DVD crap.The best thing about ""Wild things"" is sex. We have three hot ladies here – Denise Richards , Neve Campbell and Theresa Russell . Not that the men are ugly , hell no , after all we have here Kevin Bacon and Matt Dillon. I can assure you that at some point in the movie you will see everyone of them in some state of undress. ""WD"" also has some great sex scenes – the lesbian scene at the pool and great threesome between two ladies and one man . The threesome is one of my favorite and most arousing movie scenes EVER.The screenplay by Stephen Peters isn't exactly a brilliant one . It feels like a story from one of those pulp magazines that inspired Quentin Tarantino to make ""Pulp fiction"". I was able to figure out most of the twists and connections between characters before the movie presented them to the audience . Yet there was some inspired stuff here – the teeth , the lovely ""behind the scenes"" ending credits and Bill Murray's part in the story (!).John McNaughton directs the sex scenes very nicely . Atmospheric score by George S. Clinton certainly helps him. On the other hand he tries to hide the surprises from the audience in a too obvious way – for example if you didn't saw Dillon raping Richards or the fight between Bacon and Richards it means that the truth is completely different than what movie is trying to suggest you.Denise Richards is watchable here . Her body does most of the acting . Neve Campbell is really solid as the naughty girl , same as Kevin Bacon as FBI agent. Matt Dillon isn't bad , but the way he acts makes it obvious for the audience that he isn't exactly a good guy as the movie tries to present him . Theresa Russell is quite good as the rich and powerful Sandra Van Ryan. I was surprised by Bill Murray who gives a very funny performance as the tricky lawyer.It's obviously the best movie of the franchise . Not really a quality movie , but if you will low your expectations you probably will have fun with this popcorn thriller. I give it 5/10.",Wild Things
62,Jack the Ripper1888,My mouth is still watering.,10,23 December 2002,"This is one of the coolest movies I've seen in a long while. Denise Richards is oh so hott! The plot twists are unpredictable and everything that you think is true, most likely is not true.Kevin Bacon, Matt Dillon, Neve Campbell and Denise Richards are the stars as two girls who accuse their guidance counselor of rape and the detective who knows there's more to the story. In the end, its a story of revenge, betrayal, lust and greed. There are a few sexually explicit scenes which may be a little much for young viewers, but for any strait male, this movie is a fantasy! Bill Murray provides comic relief as Matt Dillon's lawyer who always manages to crack a joke just at the right time. Although his part is not that big, he is a key character. So, you know those movies where you think something is true, and then it turns out not to be true, and something else comes out of that little mistake you made? You know what kind of movie I'm talking about? Well, take that scenario, through in a couple more reversals of thinking something is true and you have WILD THINGS. There are literally about a million plot twists in this film. And they all make sense! How many movies can you say actually make sense when you sit down to really think about what is going on? Not very many, especially when the plot is consistantly twisting.Like in that stupid movie ""Double Take"" with Eddie Griffin-- the plot is always twisting. And in the end, the whole movie made absolutely no sense! This film is different. It was expertly structured by a guy who had some serious time to think and then a few sex scenes were thrown in for good measure. WILD THINGS gets 5/5.",Wild Things

At first it seems odd why it's so lighthearted when it has a plot that is more appropriate for a serious drama, but after it begins to reveal itself the reasoning becomes clear. This isn't a picture that takes itself too seriously nor does it want its audience too. Everything plays out with complete nonchalance and it kills off characters without skipping a beat, as it peppers you with twists.Wild Things has so many turns and shocking reveals to its story that after a while it seems like a joke. The direction of the movie changes probably 7 or 8 times, and after a while they lose their impact. Constantly reevaluating itself becomes the m.o of this movie and the shocking twists cease to be so shocking-they even start to dilute the movie instead.However, the movie never becomes dull and with some decent style and performances-most notably a scene stealing effort from Bill Murray-Wild Things has enough going for it to keep it from being a bad film.",Wild Things

On one hand I really enjoyed all the actors and actresses in it and it had a great story and beginning but as the movie went on and after about 300 twists later I find the movie to be just getting silly but it did come through in the end and wrap everything up nicely.This movie is about a teacher who is accused by two of his young students of rape. They take him to court and make a case agaisnt him but everything is not as it seems.This movie was really good I just feel it did not need to get so silly and overdone exspecially near the end.

68,Movie-12,A sexy sizzler that will keep you guessing. *** out of ****,8,4 May 1999,"When I first heard of ""Wild Things,"" I expected it to be one of those greatly offensive lurid trash movies that contain lots of vulgar material, sexy twists and bizarre happenings. After watching it, I realized that I was corrected. What I never guessed, however, was how entertaining the movie actually was. This movie has more unexpected twists in it than it can actually tell in its 113 minutes, so in the ending credits they're still explaining the hidden elements. This is a clash of originality, sex, humor and suspense and fun.The movie's plot is so annoying, yet smart and trashy. The filmmakers give only enough information away so that we can't figure anything out on our own, and that we can guess and interpret things maybe differently that a person watching the film from a different angle.It takes place in a Florida town called Blue Bay. It's a little city where alligators roam the green tropical swamps and marshes that look creepy and uneasy. Matt Dillon plays Sam Lombardo, a well respected high school guidance counselor, who at the beginning, hosts a seminar about sex crimes. Kevin Bacon is officer Ray Duquette, and his partner, played by Daphne Rubin-Vega, is named Gloria Perez.Then the film introduces the attractive young Kelly Van Ryan, the rich spoilt but unhappy brat of Sandra Van Ryan, who is having an affair with Lombardo. The father of Kelly killed himself, leaving the two of them lonely and hapless for years.Another key player in the film's plot is Suzie Toller (Campbell), another young lady who lives in a beat-up trailer behind an alligator farm, and is not so wealthy.Soon after the characters are properly introduced, Kelly follows Lombardo home, asks for a ride to someplace, washes his car, and appears in his living room so wet and seductive, only the imagination can wonder what happens next, for all that we see in Kelly leaving the trailer of Sam's after a while looking mad. Latter, we learn that she is testifying that she was raped by him. Her mother is outraged.The movie follows a series of over six twists (I counted, but I may have missed a few, it is hard to tell.) many double crosses, unexpected turns, character deceptions and even a few triple crosses leaving only the phrase that comes to mind that no one is who they seem to be.The actors are indeed a little soap opera like. That is Especially true for Denise Richards, from ""Starship Troopers,"" who's entirety seems so over acted and fake, put on that I didn't even buy her character.  Who is devilishly perfect, however is Neve Campbell. My raves go out to this person who is capable of a performance tower above all others here. Kevin Bacon and Matt Dillon both were right on the mark, here. While Theresa Russell and Bill Murray did what they could in what little screen time they had.After screening ""Goodbye, Lover"" a few days ago, and ""Wild Things"" today, I am beginning to realize what movie like this are all about; they exists only to keep an audience guessing what will happen next, but then, they don't necessary know what already has happened, now do they?",Wild Things
69,alice liddell,Superb: the spirit of Russ Meyer is alive and well.,7,4 May 2000,"Frenziedly campy thriller which manages to undermine everything it purports to be - a pumping exploitation movie - through excess, parody, irony to create a Russ Meyer classic for the 1990s.  Never mind swimming pool/menage a trois frolics - the key to the film is the Kevin Bacon shower scene, where the seeming 'straight' impulse becomes something else much more fun.  What's more, it actually tells us if we care to notice - we should be looking at the swamps, not Miami, those crocodiles and their tears. 
This is a perfect vehicle for the unhinged normality of Bill Murray, who gives another sly, moving, wicked performance.  He is our greatest actor. Add to this a subtle film-viewing/exploitation/the Law critique from HENRY-director MacNaughton, and what more could you ask for?",Wild Things
70,moviesleuth2,Sub-par Thriller,6,7 June 2009,"""Wild Things"" has been compared to ""Basic Instinct,"" and that's an apt comparison. Both are steamy, pulpy thrillers filled with sex, violence and diabolical schemes. But while ""Basic Instinct"" succeeds in its ambitions, ""Wild Things"" doesn't.Sam Lombardo (Matt Dillon) is the much beloved guidance counselor at a Florida high school. But two students, rich kid Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards) and self-proclaimed ""white trash"" Suzy Toller (Neve Campbell) accuse Lombardo of rape. But did he do it, or is something more devious afoot?There are two big problems with ""Wild Things:"" the script and the direction. This kind of thriller needs two things, and in as much amounts as possible: atmosphere and sleaze. Unfortunately, director John McNaughton makes the mistake of misunderstanding the material. He knows it's supposed to be pulpy, but he presents the mood with subtlety. This is precisely the wrong thing to do with this kind of story. Furthermore, when the first big twist comes, McNaughton doesn't know how to handle the material anymore, and he becomes unsure of how to proceed. The result is an unconvincing second half. Finally, McNaughton does not know how to pan a camera. When the camera moves, it is done so badly that it's jarring.The script's deficiencies would not be so noticeable if McNaughton's direction had been better (at least until the end). As such, they are emphasized. The story works great until the final 20 minutes, when it really falls apart. Writer Stephen Peters is so determined to bend the story over itself again and again that it ceases to make sense.The acting is okay. Matt Dillon fares the best as Lambardo. Denise Richards is less effective as Kelly, then Neve Campbell comes in third. Kevin Bacon is flat, and Bill Murray is miscast.

72,CANpatbuck3664,Vastly Underrated Trashy Camp Classic,8,2 March 2020,"The perfect guilty pleasure film is like a well-mixed cocktail or your mom's secret recipe for her lasagna. The ingredients seem easy to mix and there are instructions but a little too much of a hammy performance here or an odd cut there and the whole thing ends up inedible. There has to be an earnest quality to it that can't easily replicated or calculated. I love a ""so bad its good"" movie but it has to match the viewer. I had heard Wild Things was a trashy thriller, it was sold on Denise Richards' sex appeal and I guess Kevin Bacon and Matt Dillon were still legitimate draws at the box office? Neve Campbell was also riding the high off of horror smash-hit Scream so minus director John McNaughton being more of a documentarian/ TV guy, I can see why this movie got made. I can't comment on the reception at the time but to preview my closing paragraph, I'm shocked it doesn't have more of a cult following, its glorious in that rare way that makes it memorable.Its mind boggling how convoluted the plot of Wild Things is but how it can be so simple to describe. There's little to no nuance in the story, I haven't seen any other of screenwriter Stephen Peters' other credits but I was still surprised at almost every twist that they threw at me. They don't travel down the creativity highway; they take the backroads. Also, like every time you take the backroads, you make 20 unnecessary turns, you have to slow down to make sure you know where you're going and its more of an adventure to get to your destination. Wild Things thankfully moves at a pretty brisk pace and the relatively short runtime kept my attention from wandering, but it conversely makes the movie ridiculously overstuffed. You may get 1 or 2 big twists in your regular thriller; Wild Things boasts at least 7 and they get more and more ""inventive"" as it goes. Between the fits of laughter, my friend and I just started calling out the most ridiculous things we could think of when the movie was building up and we called a couple of them just ahead of time. Wild Things also holds the distinction of being the first movie I've seen that has exposition playing through the credits to try and justify where it ended up. These were scenes that were cut out of the movie and re-inserted once it was over? The movie is already finished! Its not a stinger for a sequel, why would you slip them back in? At that point the audience is leaving confused whether you like it or not, its too late to repair it.Everyone acting in this movie has talent but this certainly wasn't the best showcase for it. I guess Matt Dillon is the protagonist, its harder to determine then you would think. He's his typical gruff self but until his character turn, he's going at half speed. When the plot thickens, I wouldn't say he's better but there is more obvious effort. Dillon can be good (he's perfect as Dallas in the Outsiders, an adaptation of one of my favourite books) but I think he was on the downslide at this point. Bacon is giving off a similar vibe, not trying isn't an accurate description but one-note might be closer. Their character motivations are constantly flipping so the material doesn't do them any favours. On the other side of the coin, you have Denise Richards, Theresa Russell and Bill Murray going over-the-top. Its actually a pretty brave performance from Richards, she lets it all hang out but I couldn't help but laugh at some of her more serious moments. Theresa Russell follows suit, she's almost operating at a soap opera level of overacting but that's how her character is written, I can't blame someone for doing what they were hired to do. Bill Murray's inclusion in this is so bizarre, why did he take this part? He's appropriately slimy and he is funny but he's so tonally different from everything else here, it may be a concession to the overall campy nature of Wild Things. You have Neve Campbell in the middle, she's a professional but much like Richards, she can't rise above the hammy dialogue or the twisty plot. Much like the movie, the cast is all over the map and it adds to the peculiar charm Wild Things has.I could go on and on about the acting but I'll pivot and talk about my mixed feelings on the characters and their motivations. Peters shows he has a lot of balls with his writing here, I couldn't believe how broadly these characters are drawn. For example, Sandra is the exact archetype of a rich, spoiled, man-using sugar mommy. Is there anything added to make her easier to relate to? Nope, she's just a hateful woman who uses men. It's the same thing with cop Ray Duquette. He's a bully of a cop, who gets more than a little rough with suspects. Any real explanation why? Not really, he goes into a case where he was tricked by the suspect but does it justify his behaviour? The supporting characters are so clearly recycled ideas of a type that it again leaves me wondering how ""in on the joke"" they were. To me, it seems so simple to paint this as someone making fun of the genre or trying to show the audience how easy it is to manufacture this kind of a script. But I look at the reviews when this movie came out, some of the critics think this is a legitimately good movie instead. Are the creative team laughing with us? I genuinely can't say which is another hallmark of a ""so bad its good"" classic.This movie checks all the boxes for what I look for in a cheesy, guilty pleasure masterpiece. A story that tries to be smart but just ends up as a mess on the floor, check. A talented cast that can't establish a tone or decide how seriously they want to take the material, double check. An attempt to say something to the audience that gets lost and impossible to digest, absolutely. The most obvious and ridiculous dialogue that's too implausible to be believed, you better believe it. Lastly, a couple of moments that can be found underneath the surface that make you wonder about the creative team's true intentions, of course. I was blown away Wild Things and if a melodramatic romp through the bayou that is this movie sounds like your thing, grab a couple of beers and get ready to laugh.",Wild Things

Even with minutes to go you still aren't sure what's going to happen next and it made it genuinely a really interesting watch.But the twists, wow. A couple of them genuinely made me go ""wow"", because I didn't see it coming at all. You have no idea what characters are good ones either and overall the whole thing is just dead interesting!The ending I'm still not too sure if I liked or not. Everything was answered, but I'm left just a little underwhelmed I think. I would have liked a character to get behind and to root for and this didn't have that, so I think that's why.The acting is a little wooden from time to time, but it's what you expect from the 90s really. Got to think this is 22 years old.But yeah I don't really have much else to say, there's no overwhelming negatives to talk about. It's just a solid 90s film.

Then the filmmakers seemed to remember they had a plot to wrap up, and every scene was about a plot twist and explaining that plot twist, and I became tired just trying to keep up with them all.

78,chrisbrown6453,A wild sexy thriller. This is what I've heard about Wild Things.,6,19 June 2002,"Well, it's wild, and it's sexy, and at times it does thrill. But I don't think it's a wild, sexy thriller. Wild Things stars Matt Dillon as Sam Lombardo, a guidance counselor at some school of some sorts (although I've never been to a school where you can learn how to sail). One of his students (Denise Richards) accuses him of rape, and his life is turned upside down. And when a second student (Neve Campbell) comes forward with a similar story, all hell breaks loose. But this is just the beginning. I have never seen a movie with so many twists and turns before. Just when you think you've got it figured out, they throw something else at you. Here's the problem. It's just too damn far-fetched. You know what I was thinking when I finished watching it? I was thinking about the O.J. trial. If you believe that O.J. was innocent, you'd have to believe that there was this huge conspiracy between the police, the District Attorney, and everyone else involved. If you believe what happens in Wild Things, then chances are you too believe O.J. is innocent. You remember The Usual Suspects? Now that was a good movie. There were twists and turns, but the story somehow seemed believable, because the people seemed believable. And the ending, although shocking at first, made sense and I at least, turned it off thinking it was the best script I'd seen in a long time. I left Wild Things thinking that the director must have known something was wrong, because I'd never seen a movie where they had to explain to you what happened during the closing credits. Everyone is back stabbing everyone else. Cops are not who they seem to be, students aren't who they seem to be. Lawyers are never who they seem to be. Now for the good things. I love Neve Campbell (as I'm sure most men my age do), and you get to see a lot of Denise Richards, if you know what I mean. And the ladies aren't left out either, because you get to see all, and I mean all, of Kevin Bacon (he's a cop). The performances weren't all that spectacular. I never believed a word Matt Dillon was saying, and the rest of the cast just sort of phoned in their work. I did like the background music. Although the movie took place in Florida, the music made me feel like I was in New Orleans for some reason. Anyway, if you enjoy looking at beautiful people, and I certainly do, go ahead and check out Wild Things but don't expect to really like the story, because while it started out OK, by the time you get to the last 20 minutes, it all just falls apart.",Wild Things

If none of you know, Neve Campbell is my favourite actress ever. Not that that makes me biased, she has made plenty of bad movies, but this isn't one of them. Lots of twists, perhaps too many, and enough sleaze to satisfy most men and boys, just watch the glorious threesome scene to see what I mean. Don't expect any deep message here, unless it's 'don't trust your lawyer if he's Bill Murray', but then again, it's not that kind of movie.

Always good for some extra public, but is it it worth the fuzz? Yes and no... The scenario (or story if you want) is in one word breathtaking as it opens like the usual teenmovie you're sick of seen but soon it turns out to be a thriller with so many twisted plots that it feels like you're in the middle of the game that's being directed by John McNaughton (the man who shocked America once with the godlike ""Henry, portrait of a serial killer"". The story is about a school psychiater (Matt Dillon) who is so gorgeous that all female students would jump into bed with him, but Mr Dillon is Vanill a Ice in here as he rejects all the invitations he got... But then one day it happens, Kelly (played by Denise Richards) who happens to be the daughter of the most powerful and rich man from the area, accuses Matt from having raped her. Inspector Duquette (Kevin Bacon) is doing the investigation, and soon he meet a second ""victim"", Suzie (Neve Campbell). And then the fun can begin...is Matt Dillon a teacher who rapes his students or not? We tell you nothing, but you will be surprised... But good we told you in the beginning that there is a bad side as well and sadly enough it's the acting... Matt Dillon is a good looking boy but he absolutely cant convince as playing Mr Evil, Denise Richards (remember her rol in Starship Troopers) is like some barbiedoll who can better be located in some yuppiecomedies with Alicia Silverstone and Bill Murray is just laughable as an advocate. Only good points are Kevin Bacon (even if McNaughton could have done more with him!), Neve Campbell (one of The Craftgirls who is always a pleasure to be seen) and a very nice return of Nicholas Roeg's fave actress, Theresa Russell. Tons of erotic scenes as well (even some hot lesbian scenes), but this just doesn't go any further than just a nice picture.

85,bh_tafe3,Mixes Hitchcock with Cronenberg and just about works,7,2 December 2014,"Good casting, a twisting and turning plot and some sleaze combine to make this a sexy and effective thriller almost in spite of itself.Matt Dillon stars as Sam Lombardo a teacher accused of sexual assault by two school girls, the sexy Kelly (Denise Richards) and the disturbed Suzie (Neve Campbell). Investigating their claims is Detective Ray Duquette (Kevin Bacon) who suspects the assault claims may be a conspiracy involving the teacher and the two girls to try and get at Kelly's trust fund money. And Bill Murray is in this. I throw this information in at the end of the plot summation so it can be as arbitrary as his appearances in the film.The film gives us a little glimpse of Kelly's decadent Upper class family situation and Suzie's plight as a member of the under-class, but the film is not trying to say anything about this, simply underlining the differences between the two girls and also getting us to pity both women.There are a lot of twists and turns in our story, and they do come together quite well at film's end end and it all makes sense on a second viewing. You even find out why the hell Bill Murray is in this movie! This film is infamous for its lack of subtlety, including a (relatively tame) threesome sex scene, lesbian kissing, and a full frontal shot of Kevin Bacon in ALL of his glory. Also notable for Richards' over the top outing as a conflicted femme fatale. This is easily her best film role. Dillon's performance is probably the film's high point. Once you know what the film is about and the true motives of the characters, you can really appreciate what he does with Lombardo. Campbell is excellent as well.In the end, Wild Things has a lot of flaws, and is easy to poke fun at, but the bottom line is it works. All of the performances, story threads and over the top sexiness come together to make an entertaining and satisfying film. Not classy by any means, but it works.",Wild Things

OK, there were a lot of nasty characters.But so what? This is not a movie for children, it's for grown-ups, and it's a first-rate crime thriller. Its steamy Florida location is played for all its worth and the plot is so suitably twisted and complicated that you'll never guess everything that's coming no matter how many thrillers you've seen.Matt Dillon and Kevin Bacon are both in fine form here. I never saw 'Starship Troopers,' but some who saw both movies have expressed surprise at the good performance of Denise Richards in this film following the other one.

The middle tends toward ""Body Heat"" and attempts to twist us around a la ""Usual Suspects""; but this is a poor backwoods cousin with none of the narrative brains of noir.This is the second time McNaughton failed to use Murray with effect -- he incorrectly sees Murray as comic relief. But watch ""Quick Change"" or ""Groundhog Day"", and you can see that he knows how to play in that place between the movie reality and us.If the storytelling had a real conspiracy with a smart actor like Murray, we might have had something interesting; this is laid out for dummies.",Wild Things

91,mnpollio,Great trash,8,16 May 2011,"Florida high school teacher/all around nice guy Matt Dillon is accused of sexual assault by nubile student Denise Richards. Detectives Kevin Bacon and Daphne Rubin-Vega launch an investigation given that Richards's mother, Theresa Russell, is filthy rich and not taking this lying down so to speak. Dillon's reputation is further besmirched when another student - poor white trash Neve Campbell comes forward to also claim sexual assault. Did Dillon really do it or is this some bizarre revenge plot playing out? Trash can be incredibly fun if it is made right or incredibly boring and laughable if made badly. Making great trash is very tricky. Wild Things is great trash and I mean that as a compliment. It knows it is trash, it does not have any aspirations to be anything better than what it is and it revels in the fact that it is trash. Director John McNaughton does not miss any chances to play up the sultry Florida heat or intersperse his scenes with knowing clips of gators cruising the waterways, likening them to the various predators cruising the screen.Other than McNaughton's assured direction, there are a gaggle of other aspects to the film that click in just the right way so that the viewer is in on the fun and games as they unfurl. The screenplay is surprisingly inventive and tight. The sexual assault angle and subsequent courtroom mayhem are only the starting point for a rather complex plot. The film twists and turns with characters double-, triple- and occasionally quadruple-crossing each other. There are so many surprises that they keep coming even after the credits have started to roll.It also helps that the film is so unabashedly sexual, even with two leads known at that time for avoiding excessive skin. Richards is a limited actress - and I use that last term advisedly - but the film truly knows how to utilize her. Showing up at the start at Dillon's house for a charity car wash she looks like a walking porn movie. The film progresses to include a titillating threesome, a lesbian flirtation between Campbell and Richards and the now legendary shower scene where Kevin Bacon...well, shows his impressive bacon.The rock solid cast also helps matters and they seem to be having a blast. They pretty much play everything straight rather than tongue in cheek, which keeps the audience guessing and entertained. Dillon walks a fine tightrope as a guy who may just be too good to be true. Bacon provides just the right touch of world-weariness as one of the investigating officers with just a flourish of sleaze to keep the audience wondering about his own motives. Campbell probably has the most difficult contribution. She needs to be sexy without being overt, enigmatic, vulnerable and yet convey a certain degree of intelligence to guide the audience through some of the twists. To her credit, the viewer rides along freely and only after the film concludes does one realize how improbable some of her character's motivations are. Richards is undoubtedly the weakest link in the cast, but her sexpot looks, sledgehammer delivery and broad acting actually serve her character here well. The supporting cast is littered with a surprising array of familiar faces, all looking like they are enjoying themselves. Russell as the rich mother, Oscar nominee Carrie Snodgress as Campbell's mother, Robert Wagner as a rich friend and Bill Murray as a shady attorney all have moments to shine and plot points to contribute.Ironically, I think this may well have been the last successful potboiler that Hollywood has provided, as I am hard-pressed to remember a more recent successful example.",Wild Things

Let's see what we have. We have a bunch of brainless characters(of which one has an incredible IQ of around 200), so many plot twists that it becomes absurd and to top it all, we have the honor to see some of the worst acting ever. I especially think of the two ladies while saying this: Denise Richards and Neve Campbell. The ""gentlemen"" aren't much better though, the biggest disappointment being Kevin Bacon.SPOILERSHere is what bothered me most, beside the stupid and usually predictable plot twists: we see a world composed of idiots. Towards the end, where Ray is killed, he goes without much reluctance toward the edge of the boat( I doubt it's called edge, but I can't find another word). Or...the cops are plain stupid. Strangely there are some interesting things, which explain themselves during the movie, like how did Ray know so well what happened. You got the impression he was smart...an impression which is totally changed at the end. Then again, during the whole film you think that Sam is intelligent, just to find out that the girl was the one with the brains. In a straight forward way: the film is totally not believable. And it becomes less and less believe with each scene that passes.All the girls, all the beauty, all the lack of intellectual ability: this is a poor teen flick. It hardly amazes you...maybe at the first twist, but certainly not again. Though that was the one which amazed me least.It's quite sad to see what stupid and meaningless movies some do for living. There was no sense to it all. Nothing. Plain boring, and so bad that I could hardly keep making fun of its stupidity. ho I can hardly give it a 4. In the best case a 3.5/10 but I'd go more towards 3. You will see I rarely give one's. It's because of a solid reason I believe: one means nothing. No acting, no sound, no good picture, no nothing. That isn't very often the case.

In 15 minutes, it destroyed well constructed illusions into cliches.Also, towards the end, in the hot pursuit and dedication to deconstruct it's own impressive work, Wild Things started to get a bit messy as well.

Plot twists are usually a good thing to have in thrillers, but when they come in such ridiculous amounts as in this movie it becomes really painful.Things start out promising, though. Two girls (Neve Campbell and Denise Richards) accuse Mat Dillon of raping them. The case in brought to court, the charges turn out to be fake, and the Denise Richards' family has to pay Dillon a huge compensation. A police officer (Kevin Bacon, how did he get mixed up in this pile of crap?) suspects there is more to the case then meets the eye and starts an investigation.So far, so good. However, after this point the movie turns into a non-stop series of people betraying each other, having sex with each other and killing each other. The main problem with these events is, that after a while it just loses any form of credibility..you haven't got the faintest idea why on earth these people are doing all these things. For example, the police officer that starts the investigation later turns out to be involved in the entire scheme..why start the investigation then? And after his partner notices he is gone, it takes her about 5 minutes to find out everything...yeah right.After seeing this movie I couldn't help but feel horribly confused and disappointed, even though the ending credits (supposedly) cleared up some gaps in the plot.Maybe I've missed the point of this movie. There'll undoubtedly be people that think that this is a brilliant movie that constantly puts people on the wrong track. But I think this movie manipulates the audience in a very cheap way and simply becomes an implausible mess of plot twists.

There is honestly not too much I can remember about this film,I only saw it once and I didn't even see it all,I got to the part were Neve Campbell was murdered by Matt Dillion. I didn't really think too much though about it,I liked it though. The movie has a twisted original plot and the acting was really really good Matt Dillion,Bill Murray,Neve Campbell,Kevin Bacon and Denise Richards. I heard about the 3 other sequels which I don't want to see because all of them look like to movies or straight to DVD films,I might watch the second film but eh I don't know. Starring Matt Dillion,Kevin Bacon,Denise Richards,Neve Campbell and Bill Murray,wild things is an alright thriller,crime movie. A bit cheesy but a OK film. Also,I watched this film on film 4 is think with my mom at about 10:00PM. Thanks",Wild Things

100,wnterstar,Twisted,7,13 December 2004,"There is a website that shows silly abbreviated synopsises for movies...for this movie it says ""There's a plot twist, There's a plot twist, There's a plot twist...There's a plot twist...There's a plot twist...There's a plot twist...The End...There's a plot twist.""This sums up the movie very accurately. It's mind popcorn, nothing more. The saving grace of this movie is that you KNOW it's a melodrama that's really not to be taken seriously.The main actors bring life into what could be very overdone characters.

101,NJMoon,TWIST & SHOUT,6,12 September 1999,"Chalk up one less degree for those working with producer/star Kevin Bacon in this wicked swamp-steamy potboiler. When all's done but the twisting and shouting, the famous game may be all that this movie's good for.
Our sub-tropical treatise on greed is set in an oozingly rich faux Miami suburb named Blue Bay.  At a yuppie private school in town well-endowed cheerleaders practice their pep as guidance counselor/sailing instructor hunk Matt Dillon is accused of rape by Blue Bay's richest brat-ette (Denise Richards).  In true CRUCIBLE style, town bad girl (Neve Campbell, over-acting in spades) soon joins in the finger pointing pitting Miami bitch matron Theresa Russell (as the mom also scorned) against Counselor Dillon and his low-rent lawyer (Bill Murray, in a performance restrained only by the editor's shears.)From then on this lurid Everglades epic has more twists and turns than the West Coast Highway.  Add in Robert Wagner, Carrie Snodgress, Broadway's Daphne Rubin-Vega (wooden) and a bunch of hungry gators (lovingly shot), and stir well.  After plot control has been handed off for the umpteenth time, our flick loses all common sense and it's clear anything goes - logic be damned! Fade-out inserts that help dimmer viewers fill in the plot are insulting and unnecessary. Give us some credit! Unlike play to film thriller DEATHTRAP, which also turned the tables time and again, WILD THINGS has no characters you care about and spends most of it's screen time soaking in the Florida sunshine and that glowing moon over Miami.  Kudos to DP Jeffrey L. Kimball for this motion-based tourism brochure.",Wild Things
102,kooleshwar,Not even the legendary scene could save this movie!,5,12 April 2006,"Well when i got hold of this DVD my first instinct was to do what i Woolf have done in school fast forward to the scenes and then return it to the friend i borrowed it from ........... but something made me watch this movie just to see what it was all about, to say i wasn't expecting was an understatement.That said in fact this movie didn't offer to much in terms of entertainment but it offered to much in other departments namely.1)To many twists all of which you knew or guessed at least a few minutes and more before they happened. (warning i guess them 9.9 times out of 10 but these were to obvious and the legendary scene does a huge damage on this front too).2)To many explanations!!! Dude we are not that dumb and we don't need to know everything, theorising what happens is a lot of fun.What this movie didn't have enough of was Denise Richards she was way too hot and even though i didn't watch it I would recommend you watch the UNRATED version. At least if there were some more sexual tensions in this movie then we could have sexy and entertaining thriller like basic instinct.The acting was surprisingly good not that you expect much from such a film but there are a few fine actors in this movie and they have done a good job.P.S Both the women look anything but 18 the age they are supposed to play also Matt Dillon looks out of place the casting was not the best but no ones complaining.I kind of liked the background score as and when it was used it was one of the saving graces in this otherwise ordinary movie.All said and done this movie is not that bad a package provided you watch the unrated version, are really bored, wish to know how and where they fit in the legendary scene and love watching a movie and guessing the twists.More like a last choice but watchable nonetheless remember to rent the UNRATED version though.",Wild Things

105,len-21,8 on a scale of 10,8,21 February 2000,"I came really close to rating this a 9. It was a smart thriller that seemed to have no major holes.There were many surprises - especially the closer to the end we got. It is somewhat ridiculous to believe all these could have happened without more hitches, BUT as long as the movie doesn't have holes, we have to suspend disbelief. Still, because it had just one or two too many twists, I couldn't quite give it a 9. I actually thought about even one or two MORE twists that could have been added to make it REALLY ridiculous. In theory, you could go on forever.The movie did one thing I have never seen before. At the end of the movie after the credits started rolling, they interjected scenes that we did not see - those scenes we saw from a distance and had to speculate (or subconsciously made assumptions) on what happened. The beauty of this is that it filled out the story and answered any remaining questions, but yet did not give us that information DURING the story. Clever and effective.The characters are very intriguing. Everyone is great to look at. The sex appeal between all involved just about breaks the thermometer. I found it vaguely similar to Body Heat - a movie that I rated a 9 and really liked a lot. It has the same kind of twists (though more of them), sensuality, attractive characters, crime, beach-as-the-reward, etc. I think it is safe to say if you liked that movie, you will like this one as well.",Wild Things

Do not try to piece everything together though as you may begin to find gaping holes in the storyline, most of which the director tries to rectify during the end credits in a kind of 'out takes' way. The film surprised me as I went in to it thinking it was going to be very poor, solely a showcase for gorgeous rising Hollywood starlets, Campbell and Richards, but despite its faults it was an original and entertaining idea.",Wild Things

Neve Campbell is one of my favorite actresses and here she surprised me playing an unusual girl, completely different from Sidney Prescott (Scream 1 and 2).

108,Dragoneyed363,An erotically superb adventure of deception and action with a brilliant script and twist,10,28 March 2008,"Wild Things absolutely wowed me the first time I watched it. I had no knowledge of what it was about, actually, and so I had no knowledge of what to expect. When I saw it for the first time I just had to watch it a second time right after that, to be honest, because I was astounded at how much I enjoyed it. Although I did not own the movie, you know that I went back to rent it a couple of more times because it was just so wonderful, and finally when I got the chance to buy it, I did, and now I have watched it numerous times on numerous occasions because it truly is an excellent movie that I can enjoy with every watch.Each actor and actress had a amazing role and they performed it with excellent expertise; I loved all the performances and they were all so fun and precise with the character they were given that in the long run they make the characters that would normally have been dull and uninteresting awesome and unable to look away from. The way every single line and move was so suspenseful and or clever and it just clicked all into place made my heart sink deeper into the story and never look away; I really was entertained to the point where I could not take my eyes off the screen for how amazing it was. As a Neve Campbell and Denise Richards fanatic, I enjoyed them and their luminous roles, as well as Matt Dillon who was awesome. I thought the way each and every twist and turn in the plot was just so great that my eyes lingered on for more after it was over, which is why of course I watched it a second time, and the only problem I had with this movie is that it was not long enough, though if it had have been longer I do not think it would have worked out for the better or anything, if you understand what I am trying to say. This movie is simply great, so wonderful; I would watch it over and over again if I had to simply because it is so fantastic and I really got into the way there was a major turning point at the ending that blows your mind, as well as the twist halfway through the film. It is magnificent, with unforgettable performances and a great story line. I would recommend you see it immediately if you can stand the subject matter.",Wild Things

There are certain movies, like Wild Things, Body Heat and others, that just revel in pure sexuality, not of just nubile young bodies, but the sexiness of mystery and deceit and suspense and conspiracy and swampy locales.Anyone can find sexy actors and throw them up on screen and let them writhe around. But it takes special talent to truly make a movie ""hot"". It takes great writing skills to take romance novel dialog and make it presentable. It takes great acting to deliver such lines in believable, yet sexy, ways. It takes great directing to properly pace and shoot the action and ratchet up the suspense. It even takes great set direction and location spotting. It's not an easy thing to pull off, and these people pull it off superbly.This is the ""torrid love affair"" at its sleaziest best.

The two empty headed females in question are Neve Campbell and Denise Richards. Both of which I found boring and so predictable in their over acted performances. But then we are graced with some real professional women in the likes of Theresa Russell and Carrie Snodgress. Unfortunately they aren't in it long enough to count. Also Bill Murray in a cameo performance. I thought the plot was stupid and can't understand why no one caught on to Campbell's witchery. Or should I say bitchery. Wearing unflattering wigs, one wonders what her real hair was like. The author of this piece of junk (and I'm being polite) was out to lunch. The ending will find most viewers sick at the sight of the fem fa-tale (if you really want to call her that) sailing off into the sunset having killed someone and getting away with it. I guess the code of decency doesn't exist anymore and we continue to make films of violence letting the killers get away with their dirty deeds. Maybe that is why there is so much crime and violence in this world. I give it 2 and a half stars for Bacon, Dillon and supporting cast.",Wild Things
115,Ziglet_mir,Awesome,10,20 April 2020,"People aren't always what they appear to be. Don't forget that.Before feasting my eyes upon 1998's Wild Things, I suspected it would be an extra raunchy film with little to no plot and terrible acting. Instead, I was more than pleasantly surprised at what the film is, which is a rather incredibly made neo-noir that fully embraces the time period it came out in with modernized adjustments made to the classic film-noir tropes. The film knows what it is and sticks with it; pushing the envelope of that knowledge until it nearly bursts. Yes, the film features a bunch of trashy people doing trashy things, but it does so intelligently. It's a beautiful excuse to see 20-somethings Denise Richards and Neve Campbell slather champagne over their naked bodies. The motives of the characters are not so clear as day within context and we are shown just enough by the director to second guess ourselves every step of the way.From the opening shots of the Florida Everglades to the city skyline, the tone is set perfectly. There is one shot that gives us a crocodile/alligator just appearing above the water... using its camouflage to its maximum ability, analogous to the many red herrings we will see, also providing a great sense of foreboding; the predator and its prey (where the first half of the film takes us clearly and then pushes that theme further in the second half). But get this... the Florida Everglades are famous for many reasons. One of those reasons is it is the only place on Earth where alligators and crocodiles coexist. Two top-tier reptilian predators competing in the same environment... which is the perfect anecdote to this hot and steamy thriller we are about to see.The film gets full ratings for its established style; the credit font, the super sleek score, its great imagery, and the actors that don't necessarily over due it or flat out appear like they're giving up. I'm not a huge fan of any of the four leads (Bacon, Dillon, Richards, or Campbell) because I haven't seen them enough in other films or because they have never truly amazed me. But here, they all do really fantastic jobs. Richards especially, takes her blessed voluptuous image and uses it to a grander scale of cunning. Campbell does a great job showing us a weak and helpless troubled child, while Dillon and Bacon play Mr. Cool and Hot-Headed Cop to a tee. My personal favorite of everyone is the always wonderful Bill Murray as the lowly attorney who defends Matt Dillon from his accusers. He is perfectly funny in the right moments.Not to bore on, but the film does make quite a huge statement against the current #metoo/believe all women movement and twists it up in a way where no one is really the true ""winner"" except for the most cunning of them all. Wild Things has a lot going for it and brings the neo-noir genre alive with its modernized femme fatales, sexy dudes, and super twisty plot (how I appreciate Kevin Bacon not leaving the nudity to the women). I wish I had witnessed this film sooner in my life, or experienced more neo-noirs that are done this excellently (shout out to director John McNaughton). I even enjoy the expositions we are given through the rolling credits which I believe doesn't take away from the film, but instead shows the confidence of it's story by showing us more.True to its title Wild Things is wild and also something I was not expecting. The second film from the 90s I've seen within a week I judged by its cover and got completely wrong (the other is She's All That, not amazing but pleasantly enjoyable).

There are several talented actors in this and the only conclusion I can surmise is that they did it for a quick payday and did not rehearse or even really try. This is trashy and not in a good way. The twists are terrible throughout. Don't waste your time trying to figure them out or understand them because it is not worth it. Twists work if they enhance the film and make it better. ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Fight Club"" come to mind. The twists here have no purpose other than to swerve what's going on. Not good. ""Baywatch"" comes off as having more class than ""Wild Things"".

118,jcanettis,A Good Combination of Film-Noire with Teenage Movie Elements,8,12 May 2004,"Since I rather dislike what I call ""teenage movies"" (i.e. films that feature storylines about teenagers being naughty at school, making mischiefs, attempting their first datings and sex, etc.), I was negatively predisposed before seeing ""Wild Things"". Fortunately, I was very wrong: Although the film has many of the so-called ""teenage movie"" elements, it is actually what we should call a film-noire, and a good one in fact.The story involves two beatiful young girls, rich and spoiled Kelly (Richards), and weirdo and freaky Suzie (Campbell). In between them stands guidance councelor Lombardo (Dillon) whom they both accuse for rape, something he vehemently denies. Sgt. Duquette (Bacon) and Det. Perez (Rubin-Vega) are investigating the case, which is definitely much more complicated than it seems...The plot is intriguing, with numerous twists. So numerous in fact, that every now and then the viewer has to alter his perception of what he/she thought had been happenning up to that point: Actually, some plot hints are even given after the ""The End"" screen, as we are shown additional explanatory shots between the credits!The acting is generally satisfactory, with the first-league actors (Bacon and Murray) definitely standing well ahead of the rest; Rubin-Vega is also very good in her role, while Dillon is simply OK. The two young female protagonists (Richards and Cambell), while not bad in their acting at all, get the prime attention for their hot and promiscuous looks...The scenery is also good, with the glades and the swamps giving a special color to the film.In brief, ""Wild Things"" wins you, and the prime reason for this, is its clever plot. 8/10.",Wild Things

And the best performance in this movie is from Bill Murray, in my opinion.I'm just thinking that the threesome scene just wasn't necessary, but there are those who love that kind of thing.

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this. There's so much more to this than meets the eye than just a boring erotic movie that can have too much erotic and not enough thriller and vice versa. But this does a good job balancing out these categories and don't get me wrong I enjoy a good erotic movie as much as the next person, but there has to be more to a movie than just one specific subject. This could also pass for an Alfred Hitchcock movie if he was still alive. The score is so well done that I was intrigued to see where this would take me and it got even better and better when I watched it. Everyone played there parts perfectly including Denise Richards whom I'm not a big fan of hers but this role was perfect for her and Neve Campbell will always be my 90s crush who displays the right amount of toughness and gothic without overdoing it. Even Bill Murray who isn't quite what you expect when watching this type of genre. The movie kept it short sweet and simple and not once was I bored or a scene didn't drag forever so we could see what the conclusion to this whole mystery was.

123,Rumples,Let's get a couple of things straight,7,10 January 1999,"Firstly, this movie was not brilliant, but neither was it terrible. Secondly, this movie was created as a typically modern American version of a 'steamy thriller'. This means effectively very soft sex and nudity (although the menage a trois pushed it a bit) and some weak attempt at suspense. And that's what you got. Thirdly, movies do not (and have never actually) really required one character for the audience to sympathise with. This is a weak formulaic construct. Fourthly, if you leave a movie before the end of the credits you deserve to miss out on additional info. Movies do not start with the opening credits or end at the beginning of the closing credits. Simple. (Besides, you miss all the interesting technical stuff) Now, this movie has some twists and turns but it is a long way from hard to follow. The acting isn't sterling, but it is certainly adequate (except for Robert Wagner - I totally agree with a previous comment on this one. His puffed up macho/aggressive manner was almost laughable). There is a little bit of tension - but only insofar as you wonder who'll kill who next. Finally, I watched this movie for free so I can't really complain but it isn't worth the 7.3 or so its currently running at. I imagine this will settle down with time. Don't expect too much from this and you won't be disappointed.",Wild Things
124,fleagles,"Steam in South Florida, Served with a Twist",8,28 August 2000,"Wild Things, a tawdry tale set in South Florida, is a story with more twists than corkscrew pasta, and is over-the-top good.  Matt Dillon stars as guidance counselor Sam Lombardo of a public school in the town of Blue Bay, and is accused of rape by the luscious daughter (Denise Richards) of one of the wealthiest woman in town (Theresa Russell - It's incredible casting, because the mother and daughter look so alike.)  Of course, Sam is a former paramour of the mother.  From there, things begin to go all over the place: sex, lies, murder, double-crossing, and more.  Director John McNaughton really keeps the story tight, and the audience sliding from one surprise to the next.

125,stephenlovelette,Underwhelming Raunch,7,30 June 2014,"If you read my reviews (and I don't know why you would; it's mostly blow-hardy nonsense) you'll notice I attribute merit to elaborate fight sequences.Literally, I believe there is narrative value in a masterfully choreographed battle. To give it antagonistic slant, it might be called 'delighting in death.'Why? For two reasons:1) I can cite two credible books on writing supporting the use of violence in stories (particularly those slated for a male audience).2) Show me a dude that doesn't like the gunfight from The Matrix or the 'one versus many' battle between Neo and unlimited Agent Smiths in The Matrix Reloaded, and I'll lose one more potential friend. Or even just the bar fight in The Replacements.I feel the same about sexual content as I do violence.It's strenuous, but I must be even-handed about this movie; this film doesn't deserve its stigma.What stigma?When I told a movie buff pal from college about watching Mulholland Drive, the reply text read: 'Second best lesbian scene to Wild Things.'The scene she (thought my friend was male, didn't you?) refers to is when Denise Richards, Neve Campbell and Matt Dillon engage in a steamy threesome.Yes it's fun to watch, but wow it's blown out of proportion.This isn't a pornographic film, Proverbial Audience.Just because she's scantily clad in most scenes, doesn't detract from Richards's performance as Kelly Van Ryan. She's very good in this movie, just like in Starship Troopers.Does Richards lose points for being super hot? She isn't discussed very often.Perhaps partially because Kelly's midriff is bare in almost every outfit. But criticisms proclaiming an excess of skin don't belong in my book.So the movie is very sexualized. Without that tension, I don't believe it's half as enjoyable.What is Body Heat without the sexual tension? How about Fatal Attraction or Basic Instinct or Cruel Intentions or anything featuring James Bond?(See those movies if you haven't.)Neve Campbell's acting is very good. She comes off a little strong in the contrarian role. Perhaps it's her liberal use of the 'F-word.'Overall she does a good job with a tough part, though.Kevin Bacon's solid as usual. For most of the movie he's the thoughtful, more reserved Bacon, but towards the end a hint of his character from Diner peeks through.Bill Murray is more reserved as well, doing more 'bare bones' acting than in his usual roles as the funny guy. His character's quietly humorous, but compelling too.Finally, Matt Dillon's fine. I'm afraid he did what he could with a difficult role. Just like Campbell's character, I'm not sure how to improve upon the acting performance. He could use a bit more characterization outside of being the 'handsome and friendly smooth-talker.'The problem is a generalized feeling you get. An awareness you're viewing a movie that's generally accepted as 'good' not 'great,' at its very best.There are some minor details I can name that are more concretely weak. Such as the Van Ryan family's ability to live above the law.But overall, I wish I'd seen this when I was younger and unaware of the famous threesome scene. I'm afraid I would have enjoyed it more without the stigma in mind.The greatest part of this movie is the additional scenes, featured at the beginning of the rolling credits. The shots tie up all loose ends (most of which the audience is unaware of), and twist the story in a few final (and rather satisfying) ways.Overall, Wild Things is very good.

126,Calysta,Alfred Hitchcock is turning over in his grave,1,17 January 2000,"I watched this out of duty with my best friend last year, but continually found myself wandering back behind my laptop computer due to an unusual and not surprising feeling of boredom. Thrillers are in my range, and I am not completely rejecting of trashy ones, but this one was so bad and predictable on the whole that I already recounted it from start to finish without knowing anything. The screenplay and direction are lousy, somehow the characters managed to be sporadically interesting, but the two clash and cannot fit together. I am in the target age group for the film, but I somehow would have found more stimulation watching a blank screen. Rating: 1/10",Wild Things
127,Merely,Erotic? Suspenseful? No.,4,27 April 1999,"Really, really lame 'thriller' for dirty old men and teeny boppers. Matt Dillon in his familiar 'bad guy role'. Alot of language, thrown in to help get the rating and not much else. Same with the nudity. (Even full frontal for Kevin Bacon, woo hoo!) Purely shock value. Even Bill Murray's odd turn as a lawyer can't save this one. Tries too hard with all the plot twists.

But.....oh, I'm so.....I'm sorry, the film ISN'T about the gorgeous leads pouting, and getting it on with each other, NO, it's really a thriller - honest, it is!Yeah right!!!This is just a sexy thriller, with more attention on the 'sexy' rather than the thriller parts of the film. Don't get me wrong though, this film works well. It is a good film, but the sex and the breasts and everything else, just seems to distract from the rest of the film.It's got a good plot, and the acting is as good as it was ever gonna be, but don't expect a Hitchcockian style film. It has many twists and turns yes, but when you think about it, it was all so obvious!! Of course, thanks to the eye candy, we are not fully concentrating on the finer plot details, and a 2nd or 3rd viewing will show us to be really stupid. Oh well, we're only human eh?The end credits are a nice touch showing us what actually happens before the film started and what happened throughout that was withheld from us.
So, if your in the mood for gorgeous men and women, and don't mind if your brain will TRY to work out the plot, then give this one a go.
Whoever you are, you'll be begging for a threesome!!(I've seriously gotta stop thinking about that!!! Tell yourself it's a thriller Doz - ""It's a thriller, a thriller, a thriller......"")7/10Enjoy!",Wild Things

131,Rinho18,My number 133 movie ( contains story + spoilers ),8,6 February 2001,"Wild Things if my number 133 movie. I like it, because it is quite original and the actors to a good job. What I hate about this movie is that it is so confusing, and tells 21 different ways the villains"". In the end you do not know who the villain was, so you cannot question this way of the ending.
The story : Sam Lombardo ( Matt Dillon ) has raped Kelly Van Ryan ( Denise Richards ) . Or maybe he has not, if you trust in one of the many endings. Or maybe Sam, Kelly and Suzie ( Neve Campbell ) just pretend that Sam has raped her to get the money of Kellys mother. Detective Duquette ( Kevin Bacon ) makes inquiries in that case. But not even the audience knows if Kelly was raped or not, so you quickly lose your interest in the story. ( at least I did ). And in the end there are 17 versions of the villains"", which is too confusing. I liked Denise Richards in Starship Troopers, I liked Neve Campbell in Scream 1&2, I liked Kevin Bacon in Apollo13 and The River Wild and I liked Bill Murray in Groundhog Day. But nevertheless I did not love this movie, why ?!? Because it could have been much better, if there had not been that many different ways of the ending.

I actually enjoyed the first 40 minutes or so of the movie, wondering where it was all going. I thought with semi-charmed life playing, I was gonna be in for some serious 90s nostalgia with the music but after that song, the soundtrack went straight into the garbage. Also, the score for this movie was awful and paired with the some of the shots, this movie reminded me a lot of earlier episodes of Silk Stalkings or Melrose Place.. or anything you'd see on USA in the middle of the night in the 90s. In the way of characters, this movie feels like it's missing something. I'd imagine Campbell got this role in part due to the success of Scream but I think she was wrong for the role. This movie is trashy and that must be what they were aiming for. There are tons of gratuitous shots of Richards topless, in wet clothes, in a bikini..and at some point just lounging around in jeans and a bra.

Two girls, one a preppy popular girl named Kelly Van Ryan (Denise Richards), and one a trailer trash swap feeder, Suxie Toller (Neve Campbell), accuse their high school guidance counselor of rape.  Now this is where it gets confusing.  After a while it is clear whether or not he committed the rape, but I can't tell you because it would spoil the movie. Then it is unclear who exactly are lovers.  A bunch of people get killed, but you never know if they really are dead, or just being faking it.  The plot is original, however, and the two girls are incredibly attractive, so that's a plus.  But on the downside, I didn't know what was going on for more than half of the movie.

At least, not all of them.Sam Lombardo, a naïve counsellor, is accused of raping two girls, but something other is lurking. A policeman tries to bring into the surface all the ""dirt"". Or not?This film contains a very powerful cast (Bacon, Dillon, Campbell, Richards, Murray). All of the performances were great, but Bacon's one, was just perfect! He's an incredible actor! I liked the comedic Murray's character. It was very nice.The cinematography was very beautiful. Very stylish. I also liked the directing and the montage.The soundtrack was so magnetic. Very mysterious and aggressive at the same time.I loved the fact that it had many plot twists, because it had me absorbed by it. But, at the same time I thought that too many plot twists was not very realistic. Almost impossible to happen. But it's okay.This film came out in 1998, and this is very visible. The aura, the vibes, the music. All these are very 90s. Some people might like this, because of the nostalgia and because they're old fashioned. Some might not, because they like mostly recent releases. I belong to the first category. I'm very old fashioned and also nostalgic, so I don't mind that its aura is not diachronic. I love it.In conclusion, this is a great film, with very good cast, beautiful cinematography, strong plot, seductive soundtrack, many plot twists, fast paced and clever.Be aware of the post credit scenes.Highly recommended!",Wild Things

If you can get past the provacative sex/3some scene in this movie you will enjoy this film as it is much wierder and filled with more plot twists than I thought.

I envisioned it as a really bad episode of 90210 or Melrose Place and for the first half hour that's exactly what it was. But then they threw in some unexpected twists which changed the focus of the story and brought the movie to life at the same time. Although Wild Things is not a comedy I found this a really fun movie to watch and I'm not just saying that because Denise Richards and Neve Campbell make out at one point.

The high-school stuff at the beginning is dullsville, as is the false-rape-claim plot device, and I struggled to keep watching. The central section is moderately entertaining - even if the characters are paper-thin (Theresa Russell is a ridiculous caricature of herself) - boosted of course by the appearance of Bill Murray on the scene, though the filmmakers seem to think that a neck-brace gag is more important than letting the great man do his stuff.

Both meeting each other + anybody who also happens to be in the scheme joining for a sexual threesome in all the movies before greed taking over their friendship / relationship. At least one person dies after the threesome. The detective who usually looks very sincere to the department till the middle of each movie is actually a player too. Sheer disrespect to elders & parents are part of the script in all the parts. The girls look gorgeous but each usurping the other, cheating, conning, murder & lies are shown in all the parts, Today's youngsters will be badly influenced to this muck. I do not know if the directors are same for all but Mandalay films are common. I must write there is no goodness or moral values at all in any of them. Cheap crappy movies are churned out just for polluting young minds in the form of movies by this production house. The only knowledge you can gain as a young mind by watching these crap is to cheat your elders, murder, fake murder, beat the system to escape with the loot.

All I really knew about the movie was from the cover of the video, which of course wasn't very descriptive.I thoroughly enjoyed this film!  I really got into the plot early on, and didn't know it was going to go so much further than the rape trial.  In a way, I would have liked it to end right after the first plot twist, because the last half of the film does get a bit excessive with the twists, though they were all plausible.The main reason I got this movie was to watch Denise Richards  (not for her acting).  I'd seen her in Starship Troopers and fell in love.  In this movie she is 100 times hotter, and best of all, topless in one scene.Also, Bill Murray has an exceptional role as a very discount lawyer who tries to pretend that he's a real professional (like having an intercom system in a one room office!).I recommend this movie to anyone who likes to be surprised by twists and turns in a movie.My rating: 8",Wild Things
156,moviestar26,Brilliant Modern Day Noir.,7,5 December 2009,"John Mcnaughton has not made many movies that have been blockbuster hits. However this movie for sure is a classic. His previous movies 'mad dog and glory' and 'henry, portrait of a serial killer' simple movies. But this movie is a step ahead from the rest. Mcnaughton has brought to the screen a complex and ingenious script in grand style. In my opinion much credit is due to the writer for creating such a novel idea.The movie is based on how characters manipulate others to commit murders and plans while maintaining a devious secret association with a second individual. The theme itself is not groundbreaking or completely original as it has this type of plot device as been used in a 1979 made for TV movie 'Murder by Natural Causes'. Each character is involved in a scheme which turns deadly and risky as the element of greed takes its turn. All the necessary elements and ingredients are contained in the movie to fulfil everyone's tastes. Not forgetting that two scenes of a erotic nature are placed at appropriate moments to exhalerate the interest. *****************SPOILERS AHEAD******************** Matt Dillon is a high school guidance councillor who is accused of rape by Denise and Neve. This is a surprise to him as he is against the allegations. Defense attorney Bill Murray is approached by Matt to fight his case. In the lead up to the court trials he losses his self respect, home and girlfriend. However at the trail it turns out eventually that he was wrongfully accused as Neve admits the truth behind her accusation. Eventually Matt is compensated a large amount by Denise's mother (Theresa Russel) after a lawsuit is filled. Howvever it turns out later that the trio of Neve, Denise and Matt have preplanned and staged this drama act scheme for the money. Kevin Bacon the detective senses foul play and intends to investigate further to to prove his doubts. The stakes get higher and becomes involved within the characters plan of murder and faking deaths. *************END OF SPOILERS**************The movie has a fantastic atmosphere which is complimented with a good background score by George Clinton. He has understood the tone of the movie to incorporate the relevant music. The simple piano tune's charm can be noticed in the final 10 mins of the movie, which in my opinion can be eligible for on of the greatest climax in movie history. The first hour of the movie sets the background to the plot as well character development. However the movie's speed increases after the court trial sequence. It is after then where Neve and Kevin's character bring larger involvement in to the plot, as we can experience a 'colombo' de ja vu. The pace is steady in the movie and neither does any portion tend to move fast or slow. Much of the second half is full of character twists and turns that bring the movie to a nail biting climax. The background to the plot twists are revealed in the end credits which is another highlight to the movie. The locations of sourthern Florida is beautifully shot and realism sets in well. My only advice is not to watch the trailer as this reveals much of the plot and surprises and it tends to spoil the movie's true enjoyment.Kevin Bacon gives a mature performance and there are two different shades to his character that he balances well. Neve Campbell performs well. She is devious as well as evil in the second half. Denise Richards is seductive and sexy but does not have much involvement in second half neither. However she does exhibit her body to the full potential.",Wild Things

The acting in this film is mediocre at best; only Neve Campbell is really required to portray anything close to a real person, and she doesn't exactly succeed.

168,squeerelist,"Wild Thing, You Make My Heart Sing",9,12 June 2013,"This thriller has been one of my favorite movies as long as I can remember. As a kid, this was my go-to flick on any given Sunday. I know this is not a film for children, but what can I say... I was already unusual. A high school guidance counselor (Matt Dillon) is accused of rape by 2 of his students (Denise Richards & Neve Campbell)... The twisted storyline is set in the dreamy Floridian surroundings. For those who haven't been to Florida, it makes you want to discover this bit of paradise. For those who have, it just really makes you miss it. The lascivious original score smells like the Everglades and releases an intriguing scent wherever it infiltrates. Wild Things takes you out on a yacht, or makes you visit the gators (this film seriously makes me think of a typical Florida tourism brochure). The end will blow you away for sure. The cast is eclectic and brilliant (Kevin Bacon is an incredible dirty cop and the 2 main female leads are gorgeous and dangerously manipulative). The sex scenes are audacious and necessary to the plot. The film mixes humor (you can't escape it with Bill Murray in the cast) and seriousness which makes it a perfect combo. Wild Things is a great thriller, a sexy 90s classic!1 reason to watch: the scene with Denise washing Matt's car to Lauren Christy's song I Want What I WantRead it here: http://squeerelist.blogspot.com/2013/06/wild-things- 1998.html",Wild Things

For a bit, I wasn't too far off, and then it gets interesting.  The plot changes so often, it's tough to keep up, not impossible, but tough.  It was fun coming up with the answer only to have your idea be crushed in the next scene.  The ending was believable.  OK, it was a bit of a stretch, but it did tie things together nicely.  All in all, a movie that will surprise and entertain you.",Wild Things

Matt Dillon was actually watchable, Neve Campbell was super...Kevin Bacon was well, ""entertaining"" (hehe) Denise Richards is a putz who should never have a job in Hollywood again (did the casting director not see ""Starship Troopers"") this chick has all the charisma of a stale piece of bread. The plot twists were fun (a couple of them are predictable, but who cares..a movie is supposed to entertain, and this one entertained!). The 3-way was not needed, nor was the bitch-fight in the swimming pool, but what the hell! Did we really need to see Sharon Stone spread her legs in Basic Instinct? Nope, but it's one of the most memorable moments in movie history... ""Wild Things"" won't be one of the most memorable moments, but it's sure fun to watch!",Wild Things

The location is the steamy swamps around the beach community of Blue Bay. The plot has more twists in it than an anaconda. As you watch this movie don't believe anyone is innocent, because this is one movie that leaves you guessing right to the very end. Even into the ending credits. It is a brilliantly shot movie, with some great sequences out on the stunning sunset lit swamps where crocodiles are a common danger. It has a great cast, including Kevin Bacon, Matt Dillon and Neve Campell. Also an absolutely brilliant performance by Bill Murray. This movie combines suspense, and sex with a very black sense of humour. This is a thoroughly enjoyable film (with an incredibly mind-blowing sex scene that will surely go down in cinematic history), that you should not miss. In the end, a very cleverly written plot and screenplay. 4 stars",Wild Things

179,risen_feenix,Surprisingly Good,8,14 August 2003,"From the reviews I've read, this is clearly a love it or hate it type of film. I'm one of the ""love it"" crowd. I went into this movie with no preconceptions, and I'm glad I did. There is a part of me that says ""you can't give this 10 stars. You just can't"". So I won't. But I loved this little gem. The last 1/2 hour of the movie had me bellowing out loud ""damn"", ""sh*t"" and ""whoa"". The twists and turns came out of nowhere, and were very plausible. This isn't some flick where there's a fantastic story that isn't believeable because of all the out-of-nowhere plot turns. This is solidly written, simple in it's way, but that simplicity is what makes for a truly good flick.So the plot was 10. The acting was quite good. Hell, they had quite a cast signed on for this. The dog in me says ""any movie with Denise Richards more-or-less topless and making out with Neve Campbell is a keeper, for sure"". Visually, technically, aesthetically, I have no complaints.I'm sorry for myself that I waited 5 years after this film was made to see it. It just looked so damned cheezy in the promos. Little did I know this was a great flick.",Wild Things
180,MrSpark,A Dazzling Experience!,10,21 April 2010,"This movie has truly left me in awe. I have never seen a movie that changes your perspective of the plot and characters so many times. I do in fact recommend this movie, it is an absolute joy to watch and it never gets old! Neve Campbells performance was, as usual, outstanding and original. The Plot was extremely smart, not confusing at all. The handling of the plot twists add to the director's mastery of the art of cinema. Both Matt Dillon's and Denice Richard's Performance were outstanding. Kevin Bacon was as staggering as the other Three actors but was a still a little unoriginal. It's not immediately obvious what Wild Things is going to be about, as the first twenty minutes serve only in setting the scene and from that base, the film could easily turn into any teenage school flick. However, it turns out that this time is well used. Plus, The film is able to make sure that every twist comes as a surprise.",Wild Things
181,GrbgFAN,Hey...it might be a porno...but it still deserves respect!,10,7 July 1999,"Ok, this movie has sex in it. A lot of it. But because of that no one is recognizing this movie for the geniously written plot, that keeps you on the edge of your seat, guessing up until the last second of the movie. Who ever created this movie must have a lot of talent and must be pretty intelligent. Some people complain about all the sex in it... but really, everything can't be perfect in a movie with this plot. It was a good idea, and no matter what people say, there is no other way really to make this movie avoiding all those ""scenes"", could it? Most porno's today have no point and are senseless, but this has a good story to it... there's comedy and suspense, and sometimes, strong drama. All in all, this is a very cool movie, and it is necessary to watch if you are in a mood for a murder movie that keeps you wondering ""how?""",Wild Things

The conspiracies played out are really good, but the rest of the movie's ""quality"" are the very seducive bodies of Neve Campbell and Denise Richards.Why do you think this movie scored better in all the male age groups of IMDB?Anyway, the movie does manage to pull off quite a surprising ending - won't tell you what is is though - but not until you don't remember any more what happened to who and why who did it.The thing I'm going to remember about this movie are the girls, the volume and complexity of the cons that were pulled. I'm not going to remember fantastic acting, great dialogues, or the great story.

You never know what's going to happen from one minute to the next and you can't figure out what is going to happen until it happens.  I only have one problem with this movie.  I did not know there would be so much skin.  There is a lot of adult content in this movie.,Wild Things

But let's be honest I just don't think that people are watching it for that reason anyway.It's a sexy picture with sexy actors and Denise Richards is the leading light at the centre.I am almost certain that the reason most people watched this film is because they knew about the threesome involving Dillon, Campbell and Richards.But if you look past the sex there is no substance to the story and the acting frankly is wooden.Does anyone care who survives at the end, I don't. To describe this film as film noir is a just a joke it not clever in anyway and certainly offers nothing new to a genre that as been overlooked on mainstream cinema for years. You have wonder what Alfred Hitchcock would have of it all.",Wild Things
185,dave_472,Heh... what a wild film! But GREAT!!!,8,20 June 2005,"I think that Wild Things was an excellent film. While I see movies for their plot, excitement, and drama, I was originally drawn to renting ""Wild Things"" by its review that I saw in my local paper (The Ann Arbor News) a few years ago... I remember that it was singled out specifically for its ""graphic sexual content and violence""... I will admit, yes, this is primarily what cause me to rent the film besides my interest in all three main actors= Neve Campbell, Denise Richards, and Matt Dillon. However, this was not just some ""dark porn"" as I expected but rather, a fantastic and ""different"" film that was very very interesting...Basically, Campbell and Richards are two high school seniors who have an interesting three-some relationship with their high school guidance counselor, Matt Dillon. He appears to be quite the stud throughout the film and there is an attraction to him by nearly every female character that he seems to meet (especially Richards's mom). After sexual encounters with Richards and Campbell, Richards is convinced by her parents to accuse Dillon of rape as a way to extort money from him... Dillon has quite the spotlight on him from the media and other high-authority figures, as a rape accusation directed towards any high school faculty these days is sure to raise some eyebrows. In the end, Richards/Campbell are really not working against Dillon but rather, they are working with him to in fact extort money from Richards's mother.... What a surprise!There is still conflict and tension between the trio of lovers from start to finish. The ending is quite shocking and unexpected but a great conclusion to this film noir classic... This film should definitely be seen and feel free to email me with any questions or comments...",Wild Things
186,Matt-186,Twistier than something very twisty,9,24 May 1999,"Although this film plotted along at quite a slow rate for much of the film, with Denise Richard's breasts seemingly acting as the majority of the plot, once it reached its climax it certainly knew how to grab the viewer by the throat.The extra angles on the story which were revealed certainly caught me out first time round and made up for the ordinary bulk of the film.Bill Murray was just excellent. He was superbly cast and added to the humour element. A good film, worth watching, but only to see how it finishes.",Wild Things

Hell, this movie even has ""erotic drama"" that is neither erotic nor dramatic... it's just dull.  Lifeless.  I felt stupider (or is that less stupid?) after seeing this film.The best feature ""Wild Things"" has going for it is surely the marketing campaign.  With names like Matt Dillon, Denise Richards, and Neve Campbell on the marquee (along with the promise of the bodies attached to those names), this film is at least sure to draw in the Baywatch viewership... but if you're anybody else, I would suggest strongly that you do not see it. Unless you have a jones for some softcore porn (which is essentially what this brainless waste of time amounts to), this film is a must-avoid.",Wild Things

Surely there are better ways of making a movie popular than by introducing a threesome sex-scene.

Not worth watching in a million years.",Wild Things

Anybody can make plot twists unexpected, if they don't make any sense, and have no basis. This movie simply arbitrarily switches tracks without laying any good groundwork. A movie can not be made exclusively by great looking women. If you want the movie just to see the women, than rent the DVD, and skip to the good parts, with muted sound. Otherwise, don't bother.The plot twists (without giving them away) amount to throwing out a stereotyped character, and having them be the opposite of what they appear. Big surprise. Neve Cambell is a truly great actress, and I hope one day she gets a film that does more than cash-in on her looks.",Wild Things

Neve Campbell makes her mark as a bisexual convict and Bill Murray is hilarious as a shyster lawyer. The whole film is a trashy as they get but it's all part of it's appeal.

198,TTaipale,A film to watch if you don´t want to use your brains,5,18 February 2002,"As I chose to watch this film I didn´t expect much. There are a couple of good actors in the film but what I had heard of it before wasn´t anything positive. I really like Neve Campbell (Scream 1,2,3, Three to Tango etc.) and I think she was ok in this film as well. The person she played in this film (Suzie) was a reckless teen who drinks and uses drugs and I think she did ok. Kevin Bacon is one of my favourite actors as well but this role was definitely far from his best stuff. The character he played (Sgt. Duguette) was a bit shallow and that is why I think he wasn´t able to give anything more. Other than that the acting was nothing more than terrible. Matt Dillon can´t act at all and Denise Richards got the part because of her looks. She was simply terrible as well. Sometimes the acting was so terrible that I was just dying laughing. And I think that was not the point of it. The whole movie is really based on showing boobs and women wearing almost nothing. The end saves a bit of it but after the movie I thought why they even bothered to shoot this film.",Wild Things

I got about half my money's worth in the form of nude scenes of some hot chicks. Outside of that, there was a garbage story with both blatantly obvious twists and stupidly unreal twists such that you become fairly certain even the guys writing the script didn't read page 12 when they were writing page 13.Overall, I'd say avoid this movie at all costs unless you're one of those guys who likes to see 3 minutes of gratuitous nudity thrown into the middle of an hour and a half of utter garbage.",Wild Things
200,Snagair,Not just any old 7,7,9 February 1999,"I gave Wild Things a 7.  It didn't start out as a 7 but that's what I gave it.  Honestly, it started out a 5.  Had I not seen the movie I would have been entirely happy giving it a 5, except I don't vote on movies I haven't seen.  Anyway, I went to go see it.  Again, honestly, I didn't go see it so I could vote on it.  Like so many other all-American males, I went to see it for Bill Murray... oh, and there were two really gorgeous girls in it getting VERY friendly with each other.  So it starts out as a 5 but bad acting all-around (except for Mr. Murray) knocks it down to a 4.  The aforementioned girl/girl eye-candy brought it back up to a 5 and the car wash scene gave it a half-point bonus.  5.5.  A special guest appearance by Kevin Bacon, Jr., no not his son, dropped it right back down to a 4.  The movie was saved by two things, however.  1)Bill Murray is great!  He is a much better actor than people give him credit for (watch Groundhog Day, please!)and when he's in a role that lets him do his stuff he's one of the best out there (I'm not going to say he's Olivier or anything but believe me here).  His performance raised the score to a 5.5.  2)The ending was very clever.  The sort of 'filler' scenes that show you how the whole scheme was planned out gave this movie a uniqueness it didn't have in any other part of the story.  Until I saw the ending I was kinda blah about the whole movie.  After I saw the ending I couldn't stop saying good things about it. Final Score: 5-1+1+0.5-1.5+1.5+1.5 = 7",Wild Things
201,philiponel,Very entertaining movie.,9,21 November 2000,"This movie is filled with so many surprising twists and turns.  Kevin Bacon shows his mettle at how versatile he is;  starts out as a nice guy, then we find out different later.  He certainly doesn't mind showing everything he has in the shower scene, which is highly unusual for American actors.  One could have heard a pin drop in that movie theatre when he showed his thing. A thrill to see Carrie Snodgress, whom we haven't seen once since ""Diary of a Mad Houswife"".  She's one of the wild girls' mother.  Plays white trash very well.   Quite a surprise ending.

The many plot twists are interesting and often surprising, but there is about one twist too many. 
Wild Things has the potential makings of at least two decent films.  The first is that of a school teacher accused of rape by his students.  The second is that of a more conventional thriller of femme fatales and double crosses.  Since neither is really explored in depth, the film appears shallow.It seems that the filmmakers concentrated more on the menage` a trois sex scenes instead of on the actual story.The films only saving grace is the quality performances of it's all star cast, including Matt Dillon and Neve Campbell.",Wild Things

Unfortunately, apparently no one proof read the script to make sure the twists made sense. In one instance a character we believe to be dead is brought back to life. This might have worked if not for the fact that we see her dead with a plastic bag over her head. How was she breathing?

As it is this movie is watchable...but just barely.  The actors involved are certainly competent enough.  And a good mystery will twist you around a little.  But when you get to the final twist in ""Wild Things"", instead of being genuinely amazed and delighted, you end up thinking ""you've got to be kidding!""

WARNING: SPOILER COMMENTS TO FOLLOW: We rewound the court scene just to watch it unfold a second and third time, it was so electrifying and delicious in every detail.

The plot starts of with loads of suspense and really makes you wanting to see more . Of course there's THAT scene. And there's Bill Murray as well. But then midway thorough it all comes undone, badly.The film tries very hard indeed to be intelligent by constantly second-guessing the viewer via the means of twists and swerves but fails badly. The twists don't add anything worthwhile and instead sabotages the whole story, leaving gaping plot-holes everywhere. The characters are also just unbelievable. They try the 'you think you know them but you don't' trick but instead they come up with characters that have no real 'character'. They constantly switch personalities and then back again at will with zero sense behind it. All these would probably have been overlooked but for the fact that the 'BIG' twist right at the end just encapsulates all that is wrong with film and then magnifies them. The ending just well happens and the viewer is just left wondering 'what the?!'. It doesn't build towards it, it just happens leaving one shaking one's head in disbelief and disgust.

Can't buy that two high school girls (even if one's a sociopathic genius) are that smart to put such a conspiracy together, but I was willing to suspend disbelief.

The sex/erotic scenes where they participate are breathtaking! Apart from that the only other thing about this movie that is cool is the underlying George Clinton saxophone tunes which really gives the perfect atmosphere of a hot and humid southern Florida scenery where nothing or nobody is like they seem in the first place. The plot of the movie is a quite different matter. I mean, there is really not much new here. It is an old story and it is not very interesting. This film tries to make it interesting by twisting the story repeatedly throughout the movie - especially the last 20 minutes of it. The producers probably thinks this is very clever, but I think that it is either confusing or just not credible. And when you finally think it is over, the movie insists that we have to know how it all got possible by showing some unnecessary clips in the end. So conclusively, the movie should be seen especially for Denise Richards fantastic body, which you get to see quite a lot of, and maybe for the great atmosphere in it mostly due to that exquisite saxophone (thank you George Clinton). It should definitely not be seen for the plot or the many stupid story twists especially in the latter part of it.",Wild Things

However the film is far too short to include quite as many plot 'twists' as it does, and in the end it becomes a confusing mess with several unlikely and, frankly, unbelievable turns of events.If the script was sharper, the editing and directing less rushed and more stylish then this film could have done much better.The cast list is impressive, with Kevin Bacon and Neve Campbell in particular giving strong performances.  But Bill Murray steals the show playing the lawyer that defends Lombardo (Dillon).  However his performance does take away the seriousness of the plot that the other actors and trying to create, adding to the mockery of the film as a whole.As an alternative, and much more stylish and creative, crime movie (with a strikingly similar plot), I suggest the serious movie-watcher checks out The Talented Mr Ripley instead.I give this film 5 out of 10.",Wild Things

So we get to have a look at Denise Richards' tits a couple of times and there is a silly sex scene, but after all is done, the movie is really a piece of boring trash. The plot twists and turns like a walking stick that has been hosed and left out in the sun for six months. At the end it's just a piece of convoluted drivel. The worst part of this movie, is that, with the exception of Kevin Bacon, who is purely overrated, this film is populated with some good actors. People like Bill Murray and Matt Dillon are just too talented to be in this film. Someone else made a comment about filming a Hitchcock style thriller in 90210 Aaron Spelling style were right on the money. The truth is though, that this ""stylistic"" approach is just plain wrong. This film is a crime, and I have been robbed of 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life that I will never get back, but at least I can say that I will try to avoid films like this in the future.Avoid it at all costs, unless all you are interested in seeing are Denise Richards tits, which probably are the only two high points of this lamentable film.",Wild Things

236,Silver_Sword,Overcomplicated storyline makes it less enjoyable,5,23 June 2001,"This review might contain SPOILERS, read at your own risk.In 'Wild Things', Sam Lombardo, an established high school guidance counsellor is accused of rape by one of his students; Kelly.  However there's a lack of evidence, until Suzie, another student of Sam's, also claims that she was raped by him. After that the story gets really confusing as to who did what and why.The thing that ruined this movie was the seemingly neverending twists in the plot. It can happen only so many times in a movie before you feel that it's not the characters in the movie who are fooling you, but the producers. Lots of spoilers ahead...Due to the innumerous plot twists, there are many holes in the story. As we find out at the end of the movie, Suzie was blackmailing Sam all along. Why didn't he kill her when she was drunk? We also find out that Ray (Kevin Bacon, the detective), was also involved in the scheme and that he didn't know that Suzie was behind it all (which would have given him reason to be suspicious). Why did he encourage the police to continue the investigation jeopardizing the very plot he is involved in? Thses are just some examples.Other than those holes in the plot, it was decent movie. The acting was mostly good, I don't like Neve Campbell, but she was good in this movie. Aside from the occasional scenes when a viewer can tell they're acted, the acting is believable and the story is also great in the beginning, but it gets a little overcomplicated at the end. The sexuality was a bit forced, because it didn't fit into the storyline as much as it did in 'The In Crowd'.GOOD: A well acted movie with an interesting plot and many (too many for my taste) surprises.BAD: It has an unrealistic ending due to the holes in the complicated plot. Some little bit cheesy/forced scenes.RATING: 5/10",Wild Things
237,exnzz,"For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?",6,29 July 2003,"spoilers alertSexual material, profanity, and violence highlight what most viewers will probably find objectionable in this film. Several graphic sexual encounters show movement and nudity, and one involves a three-way sex scene that also leads into some lesbian behavior. The edited version is entertaining and twisty. I recommend it only if you can catch it in an edited version.When high school counselor Sam turns down the sexual advances of teenage Kelly Van Ryan, she cries rape. Although he is respected in the community, he is suspended from the school and enlists the help of an attorney Bowden. Suzie Toller, another teenager comes forward with a similar story about Sam. However, Bowden puts the pressure back on her and forces her to confess to a plot she and Kelly Van Ryan concocted in order to ruin Sam. The local investigating cop Ray thinks that Sam and the two girls were in it all together hoping to get $8.5 million out of Kelly's mother. This movie shows how some of us made money their master and they'll do anything (kill, steal,..) to reach their goal in this short life on earth. The bible says No servant can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?. Disturbing ending for most viewers for the criminals run away without getting caught. In real life some criminals may never get caught. The bible says do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?.",Wild Things

Somebody should have told the director that in a film when you have lots of twists and turns you have to have at least one major character who isn't aware of what the twists and turns are. That way the audience doesn't feel like everything it should have known about the plot happened before the film took up the story of the characters. e.g. In ""The Usual Suspects"" the audience is just as dumb as the Detective, without the Detective character the film is just series of lies that serve no point other than winding the audience up. In ""Wild Things"" there is no character that doesn't know the whole point of the lies from the very beginning (apart from a few minor characters who are barley involved), so the only person fooled is the one sitting in front of the screen.",Wild Things

244,keithslininger,A series of surprises don't save this monstrosity,5,6 January 2003,"Prior to viewing this film, all I ever heard about it was the fact that Denise Richards, Neve Campbell and Matt Dillon engaged in a steamy threesome at some point in the movie.  From this, I made the assumption that the movie was basically a soft-core adult film.  However, upon actually viewing it, I found that the film is actually not that at all.The story begins when a couple of high school girls accuse their guidance counselor of rape.  However, the movie is far from over after this case is settled.  Soon thereafter it stems into a complex story of trust and betrayal which all centrals around the idea of greed for money.  Every time I thought I had things figured out there was a sudden twist in the plot that took me off guard, with a different winner of the whole ordeal.  It is difficult to go much further without giving the movie away, but unfortunately the added surprise plot twists ultimately don't save the film. The constant and sudden plot changes weren't executed very well, making the story unbelievable after a while.Even though the appearance of the film at many times is misleading, I still found it to be overly cheesy at times.  This was partly due to sub-par acting.  The best performance was done by Kevin Bacon, even though I wasn't too impressed with him.  To tell you the truth I can't think of a single good Kevin Bacon movie.  It is a shame he was surrounded by the questionable acting of Neve Campbell, Matt Dillon and Denise Richards.  Neve Campbell's performance was characterized by her trademark stutter and unnecessary subtleness.  She nearly drove me crazy half-way through the movie.  Matt Dillon and Denies Richards weren't much better in the acting department. As a saving grace, Bill Murray delivered the comic relief aspect of this movie exceptionally.  It is a shame he only played a minor role in the movie.To sum things up, even though this movie wasn't exactly what I expected of it, the actual story-line was so unmemorable that it will only be a matter of time before I begin referring it to ""the movie where  Denise Richards, Neve Campbell and Matt Dillon engage in a steamy threesome.""

It's in one of those terrific sub-genre plot twist movies like Psycho, Fargo, The Crying Game, Pulp Fiction, etc. that has not one but several twists, only ""Wild Things"" takes it to the extreme (and I mean EXTREME). I love movies like that, in fact all four of the movies I mentioned above are among my favorite flicks of all time, but the fact that ""Wild Things"" takes it too far, lacking reason and dumbing plot, adds to the crappy camera work, stupid music, and bad acting (Neve Campbell is very hot, but has the talent of the Spice Girls....yeah, tilt your head back and forth like Joey on ""Dawson's Creek"".....I just know that Oscar is on the way!) to make a bad movie. Yet, though the plot is dumb, it's still very unpredictable and often clever to make a great/awful movie.So, there's my serious critique. Now, go rent the movie!

257,TooTz,"A wild, wonderful movie!",9,28 July 1999,"""Wild Things"" is one of the most surprising movies of the year! It is really hard to explain the twisted plot without giving away any surprises, but I will do my best. Sam Lombardo (Matt Dillon) is a respectable guidance counselor at Blue Bay High School in Blue Bay, Florida. He is a hottie too. All of the girls want to get with him, especially rich girl Kelly Van Ryan (the wonderful, Denise Richards.) Lombardo and Kelly's mom Sandra (Theresa Russell) had a fling at one time, and I think that is why Kelly really wanted Mr. Lombardo. Anyway, one day, she and a friend go to wash Mr. Lombardo's jeep for a school thing. Kelly then goes into his house,  and runs back out, and the next day, she accuses him of rape. Then, white trash Suzy Tuller (the never better, Neve Campbell) accuses him of rape too. Two suspicious cops (Kevin Bacon and Daphne Rubin-Vega) investigate the rape charges put on by the girls, and soon the plot twists begin. Good performances, especially from Richards and Campbell, and the mixture of sex, suspense, comedy, and the plot that is as twisted as a country back road makes ""Wild Things"" worth watching again and again.

259,copp,Brilliant work of swervery,10,29 December 1999,"I was expecting very little from Wild Things from the trailer which was shown in Germany. After having watched the film, I knew why the trailer revealed so little and covered so little ground.Wild Things can be summed by the classic Twin Peaks phrase ""the owls aren't what they seem"". Everybody is trying to fool everyone else.What I liked most about the movie is that despite being misled the entire film, as a viewer I was able to enjoy the ending. I didn't feel conned and the way it was presented was absolutely flawless.I couldn't help but leave the cinema with a big grin on my face which said ""thanks for showing me that not everything in Hollywood has become bland and predictable"".This film isn't just highly recommended, it should be mandatory viewing for any aspiring writer.",Wild Things
260,Yogiyahooeys,Very entertaining; definitely trashy,8,10 February 2000,"I hesitated to watch this movie for a long time.  I am not the kind of person that watches trashy movies.  By trashy I mean having gratuitous sex and/or violence.  However, I HAD heard of the twists and turns that this movie possessed, and last night when I saw that it was on and since there was nothing else to do I watched it.Without a doubt this movie is trashy.  There is an excess of both violence, sex, and language.  But, the truth be known, I actually liked the movie. This is one of those movies where I can recommend it, but I can only highly recommend it if you can catch it in an edited version.  Why they can't make movies like this as PG-13 movies I don't know.  Everything that was gratuitous in the movie was unnecessary.  Oh well.....Getting to the movie, this was definitely Hitchcockian in feel.  Every time that you think that you have it figured out, the plot is changed on you. At least that is how it is supposed to be.  I saw almost every plot twist coming.  There were, however, a couple that completely stunned me.  That is what makes the movie worth seeing.  If your sick of all of the 'hero saves the day' movies that Hollywood seems to churn out regularly then you definitely need to see this movie.  What really chills me is that it almost appears that they intentionally led you into a false sense of security by feeding you a few predictable plot twists in order to catch you on the really big ones.What especially makes this movie Hitchcockian is its habit of not showing scenes and allowing your imagination to play things out on its own.  The method of manipulating you in that manner is masterful.  Most of the missing scenes are actually played at the end of the movie during the credits in a manner that I am not sure whether Hitchcock would have approved of or not. Regardless, they are still wonderful and add a whole other dimension to the movie.In summary, I give this movie a 8/10.  It would have been a 9/10 if not for all the gratuitous sex.",Wild Things

Unlike many of the reviews around here, I was intrigued by the plot twists (no matter how absurd some of them were...) that kept you guessing throughout the film. That's a big change from most thrillers that steal their plot from every other movie and treat you like a 5 year old that can't follow the action if they move too fast. I've recommended this film to several people over the years and they've all given me a thumbs up so don't dismiss it until you've viewed it.",Wild Things

The director was able to convey the story effectively throughout the whole movie.",8,20 June 2011,"WILD THINGS (1998) The movie Wild Things (1998) which is directed by John McNaughton, is a mix of crime, mystery and thriller. The movie is about a high school counselor who is accused for raping to students. There are three main characters in the beginning; Sam Lombardo played by Matt Dillon who is the highs school counselor, Kelly Van Ryan played by Denise Richards as one of the student who is sexy, seductive, rich and popular among students, and Suzie Toller played by Neve Campbell as the student who is poor and with a bad cunning personality. The story starts when Kelly had a crush on Sam and when he turned her down, she and her friend Suzie thought of paying it back with accusing him for rap charges which will ruin his whole career. When the cop, Ray Duquette played by Kevin Bacon, work on the cases, he happened to suspect it as a conspiracy which reviled the whole plan between Sam, Kelly and Suzie. Then only the real story started to unfold. As the story unfolds, the real theme turns out to be greed, betrayal and revenge. In the beginning, the whole thing about rape is plan by Sam, Kelly and Suzie. First Kelly files a case against Sam saying he rape her, in the end trial leaves Kelly's rich and famous family in humiliation and Sam walks out with $8 million as a settlement. The greed for money led Suzie to plane a game on top of both Sam's and Kelly's plans which end up murdering Kelly, Sam and the police officer Ray tactically. The series of Flashbacks from Suzie's memory revels that she did all of this in order to take the revenge from her step sister, who happened to be Kelly's mom for being detested and neglected by their dad. The character of Suzie made all the audience think that the mastermind is Sam and took herself out of the story for a little bit by faking her own death. The feelings of poverty, greed and revenge made her to be the mastermind of the story which surprises the audience in the end. The director, John McNaughton has effectively used thematic elements to make the movie so much interesting and keep the audience guessing what is going to happen in the movie next. The character of Suzie shows the effective use of ""Irony of Character"", that is what made the whole movie interesting. First, Suzie was introduced as a poor and a willful neglected girl which made her underestimated in the story. In the end she turned the whole story upside down by taking the control of it. One of the most important element was ""flashbacks"" which revealed the whole part of the theme. Overall, Wild Things (1998) was a great movie filled with suspicion, mystery and crime. The director was able to convey the story effectively throughout the whole movie. With all the effects and techniques, the director of the movie has been able to present a brilliant cinema production.",Wild Things

If you would like to watch a good movie, pass this one up. This movie proves that even decent actors can't fix a bad script. Oh, there are a lot of twists & turns to attempt to move the plot along & keep you interested, but there's no escaping the ridiculous dialogue & farcical acting. In my opinion, Matt Dillon and Kevin Bacon should be ashamed of themselves.

Everyone must have needed a paycheck desperately, there was so many twists and turns you really didn't care about any of the characters by the end. I guess the scripts aren't pouring in for Matt Dillion, Bill Murray, Denise Richards and Neve Campbell anymore. Save your time and money!

Apart from some stylish visuals and a flavourful musical score, there is nothing to recommend about this turkey: a plot with twists and turns which are about as inspired as those of a typical ""Road Runner"" cartoon, ludicrous situations and dialogue, kinky sex (though the filmmakers shy away from showing anything truly(!) sexy, thus protecting the film's ""R"" rating) and one-dimensional characters. The first hour is almost unbearably stale and monotonous, while the ""inventiveness"" of the remaining 40 minutes (with twists, double twists, and double-double twists) are so far-fetched and unconvincing they'll make you wince!

He goe to his cabin and sees some muddy footsteps on the porch. How is it possible to make suchs footsteps when you must walk over dry sand to enter the cabin?!There are some more, but I some other things to do.

I've just been browsing through the other user comments and I am alarmed to discover that they are, for the most part, overwhelmingly positive. Am I the only person who was appalled by the sheer awfulness of this movie?The most mystifying thing about the whole experience was this: how could so many talented actors, actresses and filmmakers come together and make such a truly dire movie? Director John McNaughton made the critically acclaimed ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer"" and the subtle and involving ""Mad Dog and Glory"", among others, and the acting talent on display in ""Wild Things"" speaks for itself. Matt Dillon, Kevin Bacon and Neve Campbell have all proven that they can act, but with ""Wild Things"" McNaughton could have saved himself a lot of money by employing monkeys or, better still, full-size cardboard cut-outs.The oft-mentioned nudity is tame in the extreme - you see Richards' assets briefly and there is a needless shot of Kevin Bacon's member, but beyond that, if you're looking for cheap titillation, you may want to look elsewhere.Ok, so you do get to see Denise Richards with very few clothes on. This is a good thing. But it does not save the rest of the film from mediocrity; the much-talked-about ""plot twists"" are ludicrously overblown, the acting is wooden, the music is terrible and it is badly directed, shot and edited. Imagine an erotic thriller which is neither erotic nor thrilling and you'd be pretty close to the mark. The only thing in this film which might be described as half-decent is the tragically under-used Bill Murray in an amusing supporting role. He appears for a mere fraction of the running time, and still struggles under the cliché-ridden screenplay.Overall, this movie feels like a sort of extended episode of ""Baywatch"" or ""Sunset Beach"", with more violence and some nudity added in to try and appeal to randy adolescents; the only audience, surely, who could possibly be interested. Why are some obviously talented filmmakers trying to peddle this degenerate, derivative twaddle? Your guess is as good as mine.",Wild Things
