0,TheLittleSongbird,Another hilarious comedy from the Pythons!,9,24 April 2010,"After the brilliant Life of Brian, I was looking forward to watching Monty Python and the Holy Grail. And I loved it, I don't think it is quite as good as Life of Brian, but it is definitely one of the better Monty Python comedies for sheer hilarity and fun. The story like Life of Brian isn't the strongest component but this is in no way a criticism and yes the special effects are cheesy but perhaps that was the intention. My only problem with the film was that the ending is a little flat, but that is a minor criticism compared to how much I loved this film. The script is irreverent and highly quotable, and the soundtrack is even funnier. As a comedy it is wonderfully inventive, that debunks the Dark Ages and legends of chivalry through King Arthur, The Black Knight, God and the ""knights who say ni"". Comedy highlights include the trial with Connie Booth's witch and the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch sequence. Even the sets are quite well designed and authentic. And the acting is simply wonderful, John Cleese, Terry Jones(the encounter with Dennis's mother was hilarious), Graham Chapman, Terry Gilliam, Michael Palin and Eric Idle perfectly live up to their exceptional talents. Overall, a great comedy and a great film. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
1,bkoganbing,"""Bring Up The Holy Hand Grenade""",9,27 February 2012,"From the time that Michael Palin comes hopping up to a castle pretending he's on a horse with his squire clapping a pair of coconut shells together to simulate hoof-beats until at another castle with John Cleese as Sir Lancelot being showered upon with human waste product by the French garrison, Monty Python And The Holy Grail is one long laugh riot. The Monty Python troupe has won fans in every corner of the globe with their brand of nonsensical absurd type of humor, the likes of which was touched on in this country by Rowan&Martin's Laugh In.The troupe takes on the Arthurian legend and really all films with a medieval setting, things like Ivanhoe and Quentin Durward. Those original novels came from Sir Walter Scott and I often wonder what Scott would think of the Monty Python players taking apart the times he wrote about and certain paradigms from those times.No use discussing a plot here, there really isn't any. It's just Palin gathering together some knights to help him find the Holy Grail of legend. Monty Python And The Holy Grail once seen and you will never look at an Arthurian piece again without thinking of the Python absurdities.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
2,Leofwine_draca,Monty Python at their most irreverent,7,23 June 2018,"MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL shows off the talents of the Monty Python team at their most irreverent. This is a very broad comedic spoof exploring the medieval legend of King Arthur, taking care to deliver a unique mix of spoofery, cross dressing, slapstick, surreal humour, animation, character gags and basically everything thrown in except the kitchen sink. It's a high-energy enterprise that gets by without very much money at all and makes the very cheapness an asset. The team are all present and assembled well here, taking on numerous roles each. The story is episodic and sometimes little more than a series of linked sketches, but most of the jokes are very funny indeed, and there are some classic scenes: the Black Knight, Tim the Enchanter, the Knights who Say Ni, and plenty more besides. This is the kind of film that makes me proud to be British.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
3,SnoopyStyle,Ground breaking iconic movie,8,24 February 2014,"King Arthur (Graham Chapman) is traveling around looking for knights to sit with him at the round table. After gathering several knights, God comes to them with a quest to retrieve the Holy Grail.This is the ground breaking comedy that introduced so many to the offbeat humor of Monty Python. The comedy is sweet and charming. It starts right off the bat with the rolling of the moose credits. The movie is comedy legend and holds up well over time. The jokes are still good, whether it's Michael Palin tempted at Castle Anthrax or the killer rabbit. Sure it's very geeky to watch and enjoy this although it's a little bit more sophisticated than it appears.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
4,Hitchcoc,"High, No Low, No High, No Low, Comedy",10,16 November 2001,"Let me see. How does one respond to this. There are sight gags galore. The king pretends to ride a horse, while coconut shells are struck together to simulate hoofbeats. This is just the start. Soon an involved discussion about a swallow's ability to transport the said shells ensues. The Pythons then work their ways through the countryside, searching for the Holy Grail. Like most knights, they fall victim at times to temptation. They are also beset on by cows fired from catapults and a man-eating rabbit. they more I write, the more stupid it all sounds. Much of it is dull and murky and overdone (the knights that say ""ni"" gets old after a while), but within a couple of minutes, there is another wacky gem, insanely delivered. Of curse, there are also contemporary non-sequiters, including the movie's ending. This is without a doubt one of the silliest movies ever made. Don't ask me to explain it.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
5,mark.waltz,"Find your grail, but be warned, it's filled with laughter!",8,12 August 2015,"It's very fortunate that ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" has become mainly a camp classic thanks to the extremely funny Broadway version ""Spamelot"" which lovingly preserved it and has since gone on to great status to where it certainly is going to eventually be made into a movie itself. With a few songs used later on in the Broadway version (which also included one song from ""The Life of Brian""), ""Holy Grail"" on its own is worthy of being perhaps one of the funniest movies of the 1970's. And it all starts with coconuts! Whether it be head chopping rabbits, cows flying off the roofs of forts, forest guards demanding shrubbery's, men in all the women's roles, not quite so dead corpses or riddle asking bridge guards, there's something always going on to keep this interesting. Of course, if you've listened to the music of the Broadway version over and over again, this might seem a bit dry for American tastes, but with additional viewing, it does begin to come together. Like the same year's ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"", this has a script with dialog that quickly becomes individual favorite lines, and even with some very gory scenes, it never ceases to be hysterically funny.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
6,kosmasp,Bad Ending and still ...,9,4 April 2007,"... I just love it. Despite the ending! It is so weird, that I couldn't explain it to you, so you have to watch it. But just don't let it ruin the whole movie for you. It didn't ruin the movie for me although I was disturbed, to say the least.Monty Python (humour) is well known, through their TV series ""Flying Circus"". The series has all the main players that are involved in this picture too. And it is a movie, other than Meaning of Life, which was a sketch show.If you know Pythons than you know what you're up for, if not you might not actually like what you see. Although most people do as is evidently through the voting here at IMDb.com! The jokes are great and there are many laugh-out-loud moments for you to enjoy ... even some you'll want to watch over and over again! The end joke won't be one of these though!",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
7,classicsoncall,"""Looks like there's dirty work afoot!""",8,24 November 2011,"I don't go for straight slapstick, but when you have witty writing and dialog, along with clever sound and sight gags, I can get on board pretty easily. Irreverent is OK too as long as it's not being done maliciously, and I didn't get that sense of it in ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"". Here you have some inspired lunacy, even though it won't be for everyone's taste. Still you have to give it a shot just to have that well rounded viewing experience.You'll also get a kick from picking out the main players in a variety of roles each, popping up here and there, mostly recognizable but sometimes not. Out of all the idiocy it's hard to pick a favorite, but I have to say, the killer rabbit coming out of nowhere is just so frantic and absurd that it'll make you double over. Layered onto all this nonsense are gems like the Castle Anthrax, Roger the Shrubber, Tim the Enchanter, the Cave of Caerbannog and the Bridge of Death. Did I mention the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch? - that's one more.Watching today, I couldn't help but think how prophetic the Flying Circus writers were in describing the efforts today of the Occupy Wall Street movement in cities around the country with their own brand of 'anarcho-syndicalism'. Early in the picture, when asked by King Arthur where he got his wooden cart, the peasant replies - ""By exploiting the workers. By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates the economic and social differences in our society."" To which the rabble's partner interjects - ""There's some lovely filth down here."" It's easy to draw a comparison to the ninety nine per cent crowd railing against the one percent from whom they demand a hand-out. Which goes to show that the Monty Python brand of humor can be as timeless as it is hilarious.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
8,gavin6942,The Definitive Monty Python Film,8,9 June 2009,"King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table are in search of the Holy Grail. Along the way, they must face off against killer rabbits, lonely women and the police.As the film is over thirty years old and has been sen by millions, there's little need to write another praising review. But let's just say this: Monty Python knows humor. Or, perhaps, knew humor. Some may debate about which film of theirs was the best -- some prefer ""Life of Brian"" or ""The Meaning of Life"" -- but I don't think any fan dislikes ""Holy Grail"", and I would say it's the best film to introduce to a Python virgin.Sure, British humor isn't the same as American humor. And modern humor isn't the same as humor in the 1970s. But this doesn't mean one is better than the other -- there's a timeless quality to ""Holy Grail"". I was first exposed to it in my youth, maybe fifteen years ago or more... and it was already a classic.That's all I'll say. No trying to push this film on anyone... it's probably one you've already seen or have been told to see. It stands as one of the few comedies in IMDb's top 250, and with good reason -- this film hits home like no other comedy can.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
9,lee_eisenberg,Ni!,10,30 September 2005,"Just imagine that King Arthur and his Knights of a Round Table have a quest to find the cup from which Jesus drank. And they're played by the guys who gave us the ""Dead Parrot"" sketch! Yes, that's ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"". With a joke almost every minute, they keep the laughs coming in this litany of hilarity. Whether it's the coconut discussion, the English-French problems, the Castle Anthrax, the Knights Who Say ""Ni!"", the killer rabbit, or the grand finale, they know just what to do. One of the best parts was the man who asks why Arthur is king just because someone laid a sword on his shoulder (""Sounds like a pretty rotten system of government to me!""). This has got to be one of the funniest things ever created.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
10,jboothmillard,Monty Python and the Holy Grail,8,13 September 2005,"First I saw Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, then I saw this great comedy spoof of a medieval adventure with the search for a great religious artifact. Basically King Arthur (Graham Chapman) is assigned by God (Chapman's voice) to find the Holy Grail. They agree and begin their long journey by walking clapping halved-coconuts (sounding like horses hooves). As the journey goes on, the film also shows the individual stories of each knight, Sir Lancelot (John Cleese), Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir Launcelot (Eric Idle), Sir Galahad the Pure (Michael Palin) and Sir Bors (Terry Gilliam). Along the way they meet interesting characters, and some die, with a killer rabbit (that they kill with a royal grenade), a legendary black beast, and answering one of three questions to cross a bridge incorrectly. The highlights are the Black Knight (Cleese) losing all his limbs, reading the clue to the Castle of Arrrghhh, and the bridge keeper (Gilliam) asking the individual knights their three questions, before falling himself. Also starring Fawlty Towers' (and Cleese's wife at the time) Connie Booth as The Witch. John Cleese was number 14 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Eric Idle was number 21, and Cleese number 2 on The Comedians' Comedian, the film was number 6 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films, and it was number 4 on The 50 Greatest British Films. Very good!",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
11,ccthemovieman-1,Pure Lunacy,8,3 April 2006,"Well, if you want original humor, meaning something different than what you normally see - this is your ticket. The above statement was true 30 years ago, and still holds. It's just silly, far-out humor.It's not all winners, no comedy is, but there are enough of them, and enough classic bizarre scenes that it's always a hoot to re-visit this film from time to time. The only problem I have with it are the cheap shots in gives - in typical 1970s fashion - of anything Biblical. But, it's not that bad and most of the film is pretty innocent.It's pretty much one ludicrous scene after another. I mean, where else do you see a knight fighting on after his legs are chopped off, then his arms?!! Or a killer rabbit? It was almost like watching a Marx Brothers film 40 years later with '70s irreverence.Don't let the PG rating fool you. This would be an easy PG-13 today with all the blood, some cursing and the violence. I know some young kids, however - nice kids, too - who love this film as much as adults, so it can't be too offensive. If I had to describe this movie in one word it would be ""lunacy.""",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
12,rmax304823,Mostly Pointless. Sorry.,3,1 July 2012,"I'm beginning to wonder if there's something wrong with my neurology, some recently formed gnarled tangle of cells, some neuronal accident, some collapse of axonal hillocks or something. I caught snatches of this film years ago and wasn't too amused. Now I've just watched it as part of the boxed set and it's still not very funny.I guess I get the general thrust, which is a comic undermining of Arthurian legends -- the holy grail, the monsters, the valorous knights in battle, the journeys, and so forth. I'm for the goal but the episodes that illustrate this fictional legend are more silly than witty, like Mel Brooks at his worst.Take one of the first scenes. Arthur and his knights face a French castle and demand entrance. The guard at the battlements points out that they aren't riding horses. There's just some guy clapping two coconut halves together. Everybody knows there are no coconuts in England. The knights are indignant. They point out that the coconut could have been carried from the south by air, perhaps by a bird, maybe a swallow. And there follows an argument with the French guard over whether either of two types of swallow could build up flight speed while carrying a coconut. The dispute goes on for several minutes. It's obviously designed to be funny but it only struck me as silly -- as did the notion that coconut halves could be substituted for horses in the first place.It seemed as pointless as the confusion of the two guards when they received the order to keep the nobleman in his room in the tower, not to let him out until they received permission. It simply goes on too long. Abbot and Costello could have done it.The killer rabbit, ditto. The joke reached its punch line the moment the rabbit appeared.I remember hearing laughter at the back of the theater. Someone must have been telling jokes back there.""The Life of Brian"" is far funnier, perhaps because the farce has a target that is still alive and spastically kicking. And ""The Meaning of Life"" was better yet because of its underlying edginess and dying fall.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
13,Tweekums,Very silly but lots of fun!,9,11 April 2011,This film where the Monty Python team take multiple roles to bring the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table to the screen is as hilarious as one would expect; it is packed with quotable lines and memorable scenes once watched nobody will forget the Black Knight who won't let a mere flesh wound stop him fighting! The Knights who say Ni or the killer rabbit! The brave knights will encounter these threats and many more as they undertake a god-given quest to find the Holy Grail.The Monty Python team do a great job here; how they managed to avoid laughing in every scene they shot I don't know; as the knights 'ride' across the land no actual horses of course they just bang two coconut halves together! There are some fight scenes that might disturb the squeamish but the blood spurts are almost cartoonish so shouldn't bother most viewers; I watched it with my twelve year old nephew and he just laughed! If you haven't watched this yet you really should to find out what all the fuss is about and if you have seen it watch it again as it stands repeat viewings although I'm sure most people who have seen it will know that already.,Monty Python and the Holy Grail
14,ma-cortes,The great group Monty Python stands out in this often uproariously fun and hilarious classic movie,7,4 July 2015,"Delightful as well as hilarious satire about King Arthur and his knights embark on a low-budget search for the Grail, encountering many very silly obstacles . This is an imaginative , glamorous , chaotic fantasy based on a haunting journey carried out by King Arthur (early deceased Graham Chapman) and his botcher knights . Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) results to be a spectacular legendary tale filled with irony , slapstick , adventure and fantasy ; being efficiently directed by Terry Gilliam . Irreverent and often sidesplitting nonsense comedy/satire of Middle Age movies that will probably like to nutty humor fans , including many Political and Social comments . Both John Cleese and Terry Gilliam performed all their stunts during the duel between Black and Green Knight , they both had to learn to manage big and heavy swords and to do some acrobatics, though never being recognizable, wearing both heavy armors and full helmets . The French tactic of pelting Arthur and his knights with livestock echoes the relatively modern legend of a medieval siege of the fortified southern French town of Carcassonne ; said to have been near starvation, the townspeople used the last of their food to pelt the besieging army to convince them, suffering likewise, that the town was well stocked with food and that the siege was hopeless. Adequate production design , he interiors of Camelot and Swamp Castle, and exteriors of Castle Anthrax, French Castle and the opening castle were all shot at Doune Castle . Recently-rebuilt Castle Stalker was used for the Castle Aarrgg ; however the Scottish Department of the Environment withdrew permission for the Pythons to shoot within their castles, saying that the film's script would be ""incompatible with the history and fabric"" of the castles . The flick was imaginatively directed by Terry Gilliam , an expert on wonderful , surreal atmospheres such as Baron Munchausen , Twelve monkeys , Time bandits , Brazil , Fisher king , Jabberwocky and Heath Leger's last film : Doctor Parnasus . The film might be described as an extraordinary Medieval fantasy full of imagination and color . Six cast members played various characters such as Graham Chapman , John Cleese , Terry Gilliam , Eric Idle , Terry Jones and Michael Palin who plays the most characters , 12 . Though the movie has been directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones , there were a lot of the frictions and conflicts .Lively and evocative Original Music , including jolly melodies . Colorful as well as evocative Cinematography . The motion picture was well directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones . In 1965, with his friend Michael Palin, they made The Late Show (1966) for television, which was his first success and he wrote for many other TV shows . But Terry Gilliam' greatest success was the zany Monty Python's Flying Circus (1969-74) (with Palin, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Jones and Eric Idle) and other hits such as Jabberwocky , The meaning of life , and especially Life of Brian and this Monty Python and the Holy Grail and this Life of Brian , among others . Rating : Good , better than average . Worthwhile watching .",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
15,BA_Harrison,The funniest of the Monty Python movies.,8,17 December 2016,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is silly. It's amazingly silly. In fact, it must be amongst the silliest films ever made, if not THE silliest film ever made. If you like silly, you won't be disappointed.The film sees the Python team attacking the legend of the search for the holy grail by the knights of Camelot, and includes lots of jokes featuring animals. If the mere mention of a badger, a sloth, a llama, a carp or a fruit bat gets you giggling, you won't be disappointed.It also gets laughs from such random nonsense as shrubberies, French soldiers, coconuts, a three-headed knight, and confusion between the numbers 3 and 5, while an indefatigable black knight who loses all his limbs and a killer rabbit add moments of cartoonish gore.With so much lunacy packed into an hour and a half, this is Python at its most entertaining (so much funnier than the over-rated Life of Brian).",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
16,paul_haakonsen,What... is the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow?...,7,12 June 2018,"""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is indeed a classic, and they don't make comedies like this anymore!Everything here is just outlandish, and so strange that it works out greatly in a hilarious way.The characters are colorful, vibrant and full of personalities. And it is always fun to watch Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin take on all of the different characters and bring them to life on the screen.""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" has a truly unique and funny storyline, and it is a very Monty Pythonesque movie indeed.This is the type of comedy movie that you can watch again and again, as it is a timeless classic.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
17,Quinoa1984,It grows on you- it's one of the most delightful exercises in the ridiculous in cinema history,10,6 January 2005,"For years I did not watch or listen to Monty Python, and in retrospect I can't entirely remember why. I remember seeing a couple of scenes from ""The Holy Grail"" on television when I was younger (the notorious 'black knight' scene and the harem of girls in the castle) and not finding it uproarious as I might have expected. Maybe I'm just not into British comedy, I thought ignorantly. Then I finally gave into it, as I got to be a big fan of Terry Gilliam's films, and discovered as well that John Cleese is one of the funniest people to ever come out of Britain. Life of Brian was surprisingly witty and fun as it dug its claws into a subject of some controversy. Then I went on to this film, and it took two times to watch the film until I found it to definitely be a truly masterful effort in the delirious.The first time some of the jokes and gags and puns and visuals flew over my head, but as an emotional experience (if one could call it that) was immediate- many of the parts were funny as hell, even if I didn't think the whole was. The second time around everything fit, I laughed harder at the jokes I laughed at before, and I was officially a fan of the movie. Like another comedy classic than came out a year previous to Holy Grail, Blazing Saddles, the whole story is rather inconsequential when it comes to the set-pieces and actors in the various roles. King Arthur and the knights see a strange, God-like figure in the sky (my biggest laugh the first time around, one of many genius illustrations from Gilliam) who tells them to find the Holy Grail. So off they go, and encounter a plethora of trials and tribulations along the way.In fact, the whole film is an act of stream-of-consciousness (as was the television show, Flying Circus) where the animated bits are instrumental in taking the shape of the story, or 'skits' in the film. My personal favorites were the 'black knight', the knights who say 'ni', the 'killer rabbit' (one of the great comedy surprises I have had recently), and the boy who ""just wants to...sing!"". But even when a weaker bit might come along, it may be a bit that doesn't lack the fine visual detail and look provided by Gilliam and Terry Jones, or with some form of wit (i.e. I didn't find the ""bring out your dead"" scene as extraordinary, but I wouldn't doubt it's original).Although many say that Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which starts and ends with total disregard (and fitfully so) for all logical rules in storytelling, that it's one of the funniest films ever made (which it very well could be), I feel only very slightly reserved in recommending it to anyone. If you're in the mood for a bloody, moody, very low-budget dip into medieval satire by five of Britain's most talented writer/actors (not to mention to 'token' American), it's for you. But it may prove too silly, and maybe too sporadic, to work as a whole. One thing that I can say without a doubt, however, is that it serves as an audacious move in post-modern comedy. To put it another way, Monty Python (not just this film but the TV show, movies, and albums) were a major influence on the guys who do South Park. It's crude, odd fun practically by necessity- you know what you're getting right when ""Dentist on the Job"" is just 'accidentally dropped in before the movie even starts!

18,sunwarrior13,An Instant Cult Classic,10,5 March 2012,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a British comedy film written and performed by the comedy group Monty Python (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin), and directed by Gilliam and Jones. It was conceived during the gap between the third and fourth series of their popular BBC television programme Monty Python's Flying Circus.In contrast to the group's first film, And Now for Something Completely Different, a compilation of sketches from the first two television series, Holy Grail was composed of new material, therefore considered the first ""proper"" film by the group. It generally parodies the legend of King Arthur's quest to find the Holy Grail.From its opening multi-language titles to the closing arrest of the entire Dark Ages cast by modern-day bobbies, Monty Python and the Holy Grail helped to define ""irreverence"" and became an instant cult classic. This time the Pythonites savage the legend of King Arthur, juxtaposing some excellently selected exterior locations with an unending stream of anachronistic one-liners, non sequiturs, and slapstick set pieces. The Knights of the Round Table set off in search of the Holy Grail on foot, as their lackeys make clippety-clop sounds with coconut shells. A plague-ridden community, ringing with the cry of ""bring out your dead,"" offers its hale and hearty citizens to the body piles. A wedding of convenience is attacked by Arthur's minions while the pasty-faced groom continually attempts to burst into song. The good guys are nearly thwarted by the dreaded, tree-shaped ""Knights Who Say Ni!"" A feisty enemy warrior, bloodily shorn of his arms and legs in the thick of battle, threatens to bite off his opponent's kneecap. A French military officer shouts such taunts as ""I fart in your general direction"" and ""I wave my private parts at your aunties."" Rabbits are a particular obsession of the writers this time around, ranging from the huge Trojan Rabbit to the ""killer bunny"" that decapitates one of the knights.Grail is as funny as a movie can get, but it is also a tough-minded picture -- as outraged about the human propensity for violence as it is outrageous in its attack on that propensity.Also,there's something about feature films that brings out the best in the Pythons. The occasional indulgence of the TV series is replaced by a more focused approach which wrings every conceivable joke out of a given subject.Finally,it is an instant cult classic as gut-bustingly hilarious as it is blithely ridiculous, Monty Python and the Holy Grail has lost none of its exceedingly silly charm.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
19,Hey_Sweden,"""What, behind the rabbit?""",7,3 January 2014,"The second feature film vehicle for the legendary Monty Python comedy troupe wasn't always terribly funny for this viewer, but it has enough memorably hilarious lines and moments to make it very pleasant viewing. The boys are in their element here, knowing full well that often the best ""no-brainer"" laughs actually require a fair amount of intelligence. Along the way there are many verbal and visual gags, some of which go on a bit long. But there's always another good laugh in store. The movie is deliberately episodic, giving each main character a chance in the spotlight, and allowing each troupe member to show off his comedic chops. There are some delicious jokes that remind you that you're watching a movie, including the time honoured tradition of breaking the fourth wall. There are hysterically over the top gore gags, animated interludes, and the occasional brief musical bit.The story has King Arthur (Graham Chapman) recruiting good men to be part of the court of Camelot, among them Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones), Sir Galahad the Pure (Michael Palin), Sir Lancelot the Brave (John Cleese), and Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot (Eric Idle). God then tasks Arthur and his merry band with retrieving the Holy Grail, causing them to have many misadventures as they deal with countless quirky individuals, such as the Knights Who Say NI!Among the personal favourite moments for this viewer were the goofy and gruesome fight with the Black Knight (Cleese), the instances of taunting from French soldiers (""Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!""), the episode with the fair maidens of Castle Anthrax, and of course the show stopping confrontation with one of the most deadly beasts known to man. Adding to the entertainment factor is the use of music, which is majestic rather than comical.The ending to this is uproarious, and does send the audience away with a smile. All in all, ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is engaging stuff that is preferable to some of the comedies of the modern era.Seven out of 10.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
20,grantss,One of the funniest movies ever made (if not THE funniest),10,6 June 2016,"England, 932 AD. King Arthur and his loyal squire Patsy are travelling across the land, recruiting knights for Arthur's Round Table. Ultimately, however, King Arthur is on an even more important quest - finding the Holy Grail. To find it he and his knights will have to pit their wits and strength against all manner of foe, including the Black Knight, the Knights who say Ni, the Rabbit of Caerbannog, the Legendary Black Beast of Aaargh, The Bridge-keeper of the Bridge of Death, and some pesky, trash-talking French soldiers who seem to thwart them at every turn.One of the funniest movies ever made (if not THE funniest). Hilariously over-the-top and inane, and the perfect example of the sheer creativity, unconstrained thinking and left-field mentality of Monty Python. Some scenes just have to be seen to be believed, they are so out there. Not just physical humour, the dialogue is brilliant too. Just about every line is eminently quotable. It also includes the most bizarre and original ending to a movie you'll ever see. A true comedy classic.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Not as good as Life of Brian, but worth watching",8,31 July 2004,"This Monty Python film is great, partly because it works on several levels; it works as a straight up typical Monty Python movie(which in itself ensures hilarity) and as a spoof of many of the old ""medieval times"" based films. The plot is pretty good, and less disjointed than that of other Monty Python creations, so if you're looking for a linear time line based film, then this might interest you. The plot does move along a little slowly, though, even for a Monty Python film(slower than Life of Brian, for example), and the film suffers a little under that. The jokes and sight gags make up for it, but it still does seem a little slow, especially on repeated viewings. The acting is good, as it typically is with Monty Python films. I can't really comment on the characters, but I guess they pretty much stay in character all through the film. The humor is good, but not as great as it is in Life of Brian, though that may be because I've seen it too many times. I don't know, I just wasn't really laughing at any point when I saw this. I knew that it was funny, and a few of the gags do stick in my mind as amusing, but when watching it I couldn't even muster up a slight chuckle. In fact, about an hour into the film, I was getting tired with the film, and hoped that it would end soon. I don't dislike the film, nor do I have anything against the humor, I just think I've grown tired with it. When it's not new and in-your-face anymore, it just loses impact, I guess. The film has plenty of entertaining sequences, and the gags and jokes are mostly quite good. It even has a few very memorable scenes, such as the the Black Knight scene, and the witch scene. The dialog is as sharp as the Python's dialog usually are, and there is more good dialog than there is in Life of Brian. All in all, a good Monty Python film, but just slightly inferior to Life of Brian. I recommend it to any fan of Monty Python, and fans of dark and silly humor in general. 8/10",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

Originally released when I was in high school, today's teenage generation NEEDS to see this movie to discover that comedy does not necessarily involve the spewing of four letter words.  An amazing combination of sight gags and crackling dialogue, one can't resist many outbursts of laughter.  Yes, there is a little blood ... ridiculously staged by today's standards, but it is all in good fun.  Many levels on which to review the movie, but all I want to say is, drag your teenagers to this movie.  They will be better off having seen it.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

It is the famous Monty Python troop attacking King Arthur and the knights of the round table. Graham Chapman plays King Arthur who is tasked to tracked down the Holy Grail. Terry Gilliam plays Arthur's trusty sidekick Patsy, who famously uses coconuts to give off the illusion of horse galloping. John Cleese plays brave Sir Lancelot whose sword is mightier than a thought. Michael Palin plays Sir Galahad the pure whose ventures take him to the castle Anthrax guarded by virgins. Eric Idle plays Sir Robin the not so brave whose minstrels sing songs of ""brave retreats."" Terry Jones plays the loyal Sir Bedevere whose hilarious plan of building a Trojan Rabbit backfires when the French taunters ""taunt them again.""Brilliant comic collaboration by all involved with such hysterical moments such as the black knight who""always triumphs."" Then there is the vicious killer rabbits that can only be countered by the holy hand grenade. And let us not forget the dreaded Knights Who Say ""Ni!"" Directed by fellow Pythons Terry Gilliam, who also provides animated segments, and Terry Jones. The result is a comedy full of memorable elements that are so funny that it is easily one of the greatest comedies ever produced. Score: 10 / 10",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
24,Aaron1375,One of the best comedies ever.,10,7 January 2002,"I love this movie, because no matter how many times I see it, it is still funny.  One of the many reasons it works is the low budget and the fact that they don't try to hide the fact it is low budget.  Also, the very serious music this movie has makes it funny because they are acting like it is a serious movie and then again they are not.  Plot summary is simple.  King Arthur must find and retrieve the holy grail and while doing so runs into one hilarious encounter after another.  The members of Monty Python did a wonderful job on this movie and they play multiple parts in it.  I don't want to give anything away so just trust me and watch this film, and I bet you will be laughing!",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
25,Sylviastel,You Left Asking More Questions!,8,9 April 2012,"I actually saw the Broadway musical of ""Spamalot,"" based on this movie. While there were funny and memorable moments like when the killer rabbit appears and attacks the soldiers, this film can be confusing and you wonder what you're watching but it's still enjoyable. It takes place during the plague when almost everybody died and even there has a sense of humor. If you're not a Monty Python fan, you may not appreciate nor understand the humor of the film. Still, it's a comedy but a dark comedy with a great cast like John Cleese, Michael Palin, and many more. The ending was confusing to say the least and there were no actual credits on my DVD. Still, you have to see it once to appreciate the mockery of old British stories which is what it's aiming at like ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight"" and ""The Canterbury Tales."" You just sit back and enjoy without having to think too much about it.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
26,Mr-Fusion,Can nonsense be any funnier? Ni!,8,11 November 2015,"I was in high school when I first saw ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", so you can imagine how many times we'd describe a woman with huge . . . tracts of land. The movie sent me into a fit of giggles then and it's done so on every viewing since. Is the infantile subject matter the reason for the Grail's easy accessibility? ""Like of Brian"" possibly better shows the troupe's anarchy-fueled wit, but this is where they push it to the point of lunacy. Silly beyond belief, and I love every bit.We can all agree it's the most iconic of their movies. Everybody knows Monty Python by this movie: the Black Knight (""just a flesh wound""), the coconuts, the Knights who say ""NI!"", the rabbit.

They have brought us some of the finest comedies: Bridget Jones, Shaun of the Dead, Love Actually, etc. ""Monty Python"" is a classic comedy that should not be missed by anyone. I mean, seriously, these scenes and jokes are off the wall hilarious! ""Kanighets!"" and ""'Tis but a scratch"" were my favorite lines and scenes from the film. This is such classic and slapstick humor that I miss in movies these days. This film is rightly on the top 250 and is one of those films you should see before you die. Trust me, this is guaranteed laughter on the floor! If you don't laugh, you must be dead or something because I couldn't breathe while I was laughing so hard.10/10",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
28,MovieAddict2016,The Silliest Film Ever Made...,10,27 October 2003,"From a technical viewpoint, ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" could be called a seriously flawed and impaired film. Filmed on location in the UK with a minimal budget and regular ""Python"" cast members, I seriously doubt that anyone working on the project at the time had believed it would spark such a cultural phenomenon. And revisiting the movie now, post its release 28 years ago, is magical.First-time viewers may be puzzled by the film's odd opening--in fact, stories of those who thought that they had entered into the wrong screening room come in abundance. But as soon as the voice of the coarse British man is audible the viewer realizes that he or she has been duped once again by the Python Troupe.King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table have been sent on a most glorious quest by God Himself--to seek and maintain the Holy Grail, the legendary cup that Christ drank from during The Last Supper, prior to His execution, and which later caught His blood as he was left danging upon the cross.But the seriousness surrounding the Holy Grail is left wholly untouched by the members of Monty Python--instead, we follow King Arthur and his men as they come upon an odd assortment of characters, including The Black Knight, Dennis, The Knights Who Say ""Ni!"", and The Killer Rabbit, all of whom hinder the daring soldiers in their quest for the Holy Grail.Many people will find the humor of ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" ingenious, while others will find the exact same jokes and stints repetitive and ridiculous. I myself did not enjoy the film the first time I saw it as a child, but over the years I have come to appreciate its humor a bit more. I still find the jokes a bit too stretched out at times, and certain gags, though hilarious the first ten times, get a bit humorless the twentieth time around (the coconuts, for example, which are amazingly silly when first introduced, soon become tiring when they are treated as the highlight of a joke repetitively). However, often enough the jokes introduced at certain points in the films are merely played in the background further into the film--for example, the fact that the men do not ride on horses is quite a major idea the first time it is revealed, and becomes the central subject of a conversation between Arthur and the man atop the castle battlements. But later on the notion of no horses is played smaller and in the background as so we can concentrate on the current jokes at hand, as well as the missing horses as an added bonus.There is absolutely nothing to truthfully discuss about ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail,"" other than to say that at first it seems quite obnoxious, but it starts to grow on you. And this movie has definitely made a deep dig into our culture. In fact, on the commentary track for the newer DVD, John Cleese mentions that a pro American football player (or ""footballer"" as the English call them) and his buddy were thinking of a plan in the midst of a serious game. Their strategy was this on the field: Run away! Run away!There are countless classic scenes, including the battle between The Black Knight and King Arthur (""I've had worse!""); the scene where Sir Lancelot the Brave (or Launcelot, as the script for the film names him) storms the Swamp Castle in hopes of rescuing a fair maiden and, in result, ends up destroying everything in his path (including the candle mounted along the wall leading to the spiralling staircase), saying that he gets a bit frantic and over-excited in this genre; Sir Robin and the Three-Headed Knight (""...when danger reared its ugly head he bravely turned his tail and fled...""); The Knights Who Say ""Ni!"" and their request for a shrubbery; the Killer Rabbit's attack on Arthur's merry men. That's just to name a few memorable scenes.""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" may be the silliest film ever put on celluloid. It rarely makes sense, sometimes falls a bit flat, but always puts a smile on your face. And that's an achievement.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
29,Red-Barracuda,The best Monty Python movie,9,14 March 2015,"The Holy Grail is the first feature film from Monty Python, the British sketch show comics who had become famous in the late 60's / early 70's with their BBC TV series. It tells the story of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table in their quest for the Holy Grail. But to be honest, the story is merely a thread in which they link a series of funny set-pieces together. For me, this is the funniest movie they ever made. To be honest, there really are far too many amusing moments to list them but needless to say they combine cleverness with stupid humour and the tone is consistently absurd. But if I was forced to names the scene that cracks me up the most I would have to pick the one that introduces us to Brave Sir Robin – the singing of his sarcastic minstrel makes me roar with laughter every time. This character is actually a bit unusual though, in that he is not performed by any of the Pythons because the vast majority of the other roles are covered by the team of John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin, with Graham Chapman mainly playing the central King Arthur role in a very funny straight-man performance. Terry Gilliam appears in minor roles but is most notable for providing several of his distinctive animations. In summary, this is a very funny movie.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
30,Rainey-Dawn,Still Funny,9,4 July 2014,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) has got to be Python's masterpiece! It is still one of the top rated comedies to date because it is very much a funny dorky comedy.The story of ""Holy Grail"" is not sensitive material to most viewers. By sensitive material I will reference other Monty Python comedy movies like ""Life of Brian"" or ""The Meaning of Life"". So I believe one would enjoy ""Holy Grail"" if they have never seen it and like comedy films.""Holy Grail"" would make fun double feature with Mel Brooks' ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" for a hilarious night of pure movie enjoyment.9/10",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
31,OllieSuave-007,I thought I was watching a different movie!,6,4 November 2014,"This is a silly comedy starring the Monty Python troop, where they play King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, embarking on a journey in search of the Holy Grail while encountering silly obstacles.At first, I thought I was watching a different movie, but the gag during the opening credits really caught me by surprise and sent me laughing out loud, very eager to know what the movie holds.The plot starts out slow from the beginning but slowly picks up steam as the movie approaches the middle, from the King and his Knights' Holy Grail search to the comical bloody sword fights and funny witch hunts. There are a smack of slapstick comedy here and there, but it is the dialog and human interaction that will make you chuckle. You also need to suspend reality and let your imagination run wild to enjoy the film.The special effects, how ever low budget they were, were done pretty well; the cinematography and color were also good; and the acting was OK - a little wooden at times. It was nice to see John Cleese in it - the only actor I recognize in the movie.Overall, it is a worthy comedy. I've seen funnier things, though.

I know most of the dialogue, the songs the minstrels sing, the timing and so on.  I have probably seen this film more than any other and it never gets old for me.

33,thesar-2,Laughter Never Dies,9,29 July 2016,"Up to this point, I've only seen Indy go after the Grail. Yep, took more than four decades for me to finally see Monty Python and the Holy Grail.Now, there's a good reason. Absolutely Fabulous, Hugh Grant and Simon Pegg & Gang aside, I've never been an English comedy fan. In fact, I've always hated the Monty Python gang's brand of humour. I've seen some clips, I think I might have seen part of Life of Brian and watched a bit of their show. Never liked it.Well, mercifully, I finally opened my eyes when a great friend of mine recommended it after he showed this to his kids at one of his fantastic movie marathons he hosts for them. I agreed and made the effort.I cannot tell you how many times I laughed out loud. Over and over, from the opening credits to near the end, I was bursting out and in almost tears from laughing. Of course, I was dead wrong on my original opinion of both British humour and Monty Python. Previously, I did keep telling myself ""Yeah, I get the humour, but it's just not funny."" Wrong again. The running gags, breaking the fourth wall (especially to stop a musical number) and the rips against medieval films and clichés: ALL freaking hilarious. Even when I remember certain clips from a long time ago, like the dismembered knight and the raging rabbit, I still laughed tremendously.Now, that all said, with the exception of the heart attack scene, I wasn't a fan of the cartoon segments. Perhaps that's lifted from the series, I don't recall. I'm sure die-hard fans liked that, but I wasn't pleased. And not all jokes or running gags worked or kept fresh after a whilebut that percentage was probably only 5%. Thankfully, those gripes were minor and really didn't take away from the great time I had.What can be summarized that hasn't been said about this 41-year-old comedy? It's a rip off the knights' quest for the Holy Grail. Misadventures galore as ""knights"" break off to find the Grail.Don't be me. If you haven't seen this and didn't care or understand British humour, take a chance and join the journey. You really can't go wrong here.***Final thoughts: (Joke Spoilers Ahead) Gonna need to see this a few more times now. I know I'm totally late to the game, so I can't possibly match how many times others have seen it, but I do want to revisit this for some of the jokes that are still making me laugh. Like the policemen, the guards, the anti-singing dad, the mostly dead gags, witch arrest, the bird's strength, and the French threats: ""No, now go away or I shall taunt you a second time!""",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
34,bensonmum2,One of the funniest movies ever made,9,24 May 2005,"Very few films can make me laugh out loud after I've seen them a dozen or so times. Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of the exceptions. I can't help myself. Even though I know most of the movie by heart, I still laugh. The bits with the French guards at the castle, the Black Knight, the ""Burn the Witch"" mob, and the political discussions with the mud-collecting-peasants are as fresh today as the first time I saw the movie. It's silly, absurd, and totally ridiculous. But it works. I sincerely doubt I'll ever get tired of it.Much of the reason I like the film so much is the decision on the part of Gilliam and Jones to play most of the movie straight. Graham Chapman plays King Arthur so deadly serious that it only makes the craziness around him even funnier. Had he played King Arthur for laughs, it wouldn't have been nearly so funny.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
35,ElMaruecan82,The Movie Doesn't Break the Fourth Wall ... It Pulverises it ...,10,3 July 2011,"To review ""Monty Python & the Holy Grail"", there are five schools, I mean three : 1--- The Ecstatic Review : One of the greatest laugh riots ever committed on the big screen, an epic quest of absurdity like only the glorious Monty Python could have lead.2--- The Not-so-ecstatic-but-no-less-enthusiastic Review : Damn, I wish the movie was longer, couldn't they get more budget, it's such a shame. Oh, well, I had a great time, and only for the opening credits, the movie deserves its reputation.1--- The Ecstatic Review (again): You don't get it, Harold, that's exactly the point, it's a low-budget film, and its apparently low quality contributed to the high popularity of the film. Man, it's called a parody.2--- The Not-so-ecstatic-but-no-less-enthusiastic Review : I know, what a parody is, Bernard, thank you. But my point was that the movie could have been so much better if only  *** WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE FAULT IN THE REVIEW. HAROLD AND BERNARD HAVE BEEN SACKED *** 3--- The Not-ecstatic-not-really-enthusiastic-in-fact-quite-negative Review : This movie is so flawed I don't even know where to start, hell, they didn't even have horses and  Aaaaarggggh! *** WE APOLOGIZE AGAIN, FOR THE NEGATIVITY EXPRESSED IN THAT REVIEW. THE AUTHOR HAS BEEN S WELL, SHALL WE SAY, HE MET WITH AN UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT *** As I was saying, to review ""Monty Python & the Holy Grail"", there are three, I mean two schools of review that actually can both be fused into one unique review, MINE, so let me be the bard to sing the praises of this epic tale of hilarity through : I--- The Self-Hedonistic-Introspectively-Tautological Review : The comic genius of the film is so surrealistic it goes beyond any reasonable attempt to measure, judge and therefore give it a proper review. It would be like answering the eternal question : ""What's the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?"" I think one should consider the wisdom of Sir Bevedere who said that ""The Earth is banana shaped"", an interestingly fruity allusion which is not without reminding Newton's apple that would revolutionize the law of Physics and originate one of the most important principles governing the film, the one I call  1/ The 'Tarte Tatin' principle :This culinary example might satisfy the descendants of the French ""Ka-niggets"", the tart was basically invented when a woman who burnt her apple pie rescued it by putting the pastry on the apples and turning out the upside down tart. The result became a famous and delicious dessert. ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" works the same way, it's botched, disjointed, irreverent, turning into derision every cinematic mechanism of the epic genre, but the result is just one of the funniest laugh-out-loud comedies and one of the perfect examples of the level of sophistication and unlimitedness that absurdity can reach, the one I call 2/ The 'Red Nose' principle : ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is a succession of incoherent episodic sketches governed by strong coherence in absurd style and surrealistic comedy, and vice versa. The film is the celebration of the boundlessness of comedy. Here's a mathematical demonstration that would have made Sir Bevedere proud : let's admit, by hypothesis, that there was one limit ""NI"" that comedy could never exceed. Now, what is the definition of comedy? According to the Oxford dictionary, it's a ""professional entertainment consisting of jokes and sketches, intended to make an audience laugh"". Now, if ""NI"" existed, that would mean that there would be no comedic purposes in anything above that ""Nl"" level, which indirectly means that there's absolutely no one who would ever laugh to any subject implying the use of comedy above the ""Nu""  sorry the ""NI"" level, in other words, anything above the ""Nl"" level could be admitted as 100% serious. But consider that total seriousness is so psychologically oppressive that it inevitably implies the use of a comical element to relieve the tension. And the use of a comic relief is even more necessary in a totally serious narrative. So, from a reductio-ad-absurdum, I've demonstrated that even in the existence of a limit above which we can't laugh, we realize that not only we can, but we should. Quod Erat Demonstratum. Whatever seriousness you build, whatever order you create, it's meant to collapse. That's the principle, the one I call  3/ The 'Castle of Cards' principle :The castle of cards has only one goal in its short existence, to collapse. It's the perfect demonstration of the ephemeral essence of any organized and perfectly structured entity. And the higher it gets, the closer is the cataclysm. What's that to mean? ""Monty Python & the Holy Grail"" highlights the eternal victory of anarchy over order, and how even anarchy can be appealing. It's a perfect assemblage of chaotic situations, that gets your mind acclimated to the so universal and true unpredictability of life. Nothing can surprise you, yet everything is absolutely surprising : a three-headed knight, a black knight who continues the fight even if he's totally chopped off, a witch with a fake noise, a castle full of virgins with nymphomaniac impulses, a harmless bunny that can decapitate you in one second, and one of the worst cases of cinematic party pooping ever. Everything is built up until it dramatically ends in one of the most brilliantly abrupt endings, demonstrating the inevitable destruction of every measurable structure. World was created from chaos and it will end up in chaos in such a pointlessness that absurdity is the only language that could define it.

If you don't like Python, but consider yourself to be a generally humorous person then you should watch it, too. Only people with absolutely no sense of humour should steer clear of this.It (loosely) follows Graham Chapman as King Arthur as he's charged (by none other than God himself) with his holy task of locating the Holy Grail. To help him he's aided in typical style by the rest of the Pythons, cunningly disguised as various Knights (not to mention practically everyone else they meet).And it's funny. That's the bottom line. I know it does look a little on the cheap side (the film was partially-funded by the band Pink Floyd if you're interested). But don't let the cheapness of the production put you off. I find that it's part of its charm. In fact, seeing blatantly false limbs severed in ridiculous amounts of fake blood.Yes, it's kind of 'off-the-wall' humour that you should already know comes with the Pythons.

37,ThomasDrufke,Nonsense Comedy,9,8 October 2014,"I have never been a huge fan of spoof comedies or just comedies in general. I'm much better served watching an intense drama thriller or kicking back with a summer blockbuster. So when I watch movies that tend to poke fun at other movies it doesn't seem to connect as well with me as it does with others. I didn't find Spaceballs to be that funny, and same with Monty Python. No with that being said there a few scenes in Holy Grail which are laugh out loud hysterical but as a whole it fell short.Perhaps the build up of so many people telling me to check out Monty Python for years may have raised the stakes a bit too high. One of the first scenes in the forest when Arthur cuts off the limbs of a random knight was unbearably funny. I can see that it's the type of scene that I will go back and watch on YouTube for years to come. Besides that I didn't enjoy much else. The cartoons that weaved in and out of the film were cute at first but grew old after awhile. I found that once they broke off individually for there own adventure the film took a hit. Much of the characters are just stupid, not funny. But the bunny scene was so strange that I thought it worked.With these type of comedies it's really you love or hate it, but I think I'm a bit in the middle. By no means do I hate this movie or what it's trying to do, but I don't know I will ever watch it all the way through again. Though the ending was basically perfect and worked as a way to show just how absurd this film actually is.+It's a flesh wound scene! +Ending +When the group is all together-Ridiculous characters (and I know that's the point) -Built up too high-Toilet humor doesn't work at times 6.0/10",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
38,ericstevenson,"Best comedy ever? Pretty much, yeah",10,3 May 2016,"I was fascinated into seeing this movie if only because of the sheer number of times it was quoted. I think it's somewhere between ""The Princess Bride"" (my favorite movie) and ""Star Wars"" in terms of the most terms that came from it. It's appropriately mentioned in Weird Al Yankovic's ""White And Nerdy"" and I remember kids in school talking about it. The weirdest thing is that I saw so many clips of this movie online that I had practically come close to seeing the whole thing. And you know what? Even with all those clips seen, this still was something I could not pass a single second of.What else is there to say about it? Every joke is just timed fantastically. It is a film which has withstood the test of time. I'm fairly certain it's the highest rated comedy on the entire Internet Movie Database. I still think it ranks second to ""Airplane!"" in terms of how funny it is. You can't get enough of this film. What's amazing is that every single joke just builds upon itself over and over until it finally finishes. This certainly seemed like a long film, if only because they were able to cram so many hilarious moments in this. You really have to think to get everything. This would have been the first movie to have a scene after the credits (the first is ""The Muppet Movie""), but it's just music where the credits should be. That's because the people making the credits were fired! Every single line is quotable. You have to pay attention to every little detail. Even if you've heard tons of quotes and scenes from this movie, you STILL have to see the whole thing to truly get the experience. Every single character in this movie is unforgettable. It's not just the Black Knight. You don't miss him because there's so many other one scene characters that are so wonderful. It's a film that truly reflects what you're thinking. In this one scene, I remember thinking that it was kind of pointless. Then the woman turned to me and asked if it should have been kept in. She read my frigging mind! I simply can not believe that Leonard Maltin gave this movie two and a half stars. How can anyone not like this?! Just when you think they've stopped with a certain joke, they pummel in more and more in a funnier manner.I lost count of how many times that one guy tried to sing. He DID eventually sing, but we didn't get to see it. Everything just escalates in the most wonderful way possible and it does manage to have a coherent story. I'm not the biggest ""Monty Python"" fan, but you can call me one after watching this. It's so wonderful description can't do it any justice.

43,The-Sarkologist,"If you haven't seen this movie ... well, what more can I say",9,13 July 2013,"The one thing that I love about these Monty Python movies is not only how the humor can be quite farcical and outrageous, but that they are also quite realistic in it at times as well. One one hand you will have somebody blabbering on about nothing in particular and the film then cuts to shots of people crying out 'get on with it!'. Then there is the ongoing joke of the sparrow carrying a coconut which, when I first watched it, thought that it was some off handed remark made during the scene with the keeper of the bridge, until I realised that right at the beginning, when King Arthur first appears with his peasant banging two coconuts together, there is a discussion as to whether it is possible for a sparrow to carry a coconut to England (and there is another scene where a knight is attempting to tie a coconut to a sparrow to see if one can actually carry it).As for the realistic parts of it, they do a fantastic job with it as well. For instance when Arthur 'rides' through a town one of the peasants asks who he is and another says that he is the king, and the only reason that they think he is a king is because he is clean (I won't repeat what they actually said in the movie because IMDb will then not allow me to post this commentary). It is also interesting how a group of peasants don't even know the king when he rides up to them (and they starts sprouting out Marxist doctrine – Python loves to use anachronisms in the movie, and for some reason, actually get away with it). While it is humorous, it is also true because it is highly unlikely that in those days the peasants would actually know what the king looked like.As for the ending, well, that probably will go down in history as pretty much the most unexpected ending for a film to take. It simply comes completely out of left field, though it is not actually out of the blue because there are hints that it will be heading in that direction, but you still don't expect the police to rock up and proceed to arrest King Arthur and his Knights. Mind you when I saw Spamalot when I was in London I was actually very disappointed at the ending because, well, they actually found the Holy Grail. Okay, it was only 'based' on this film, but to be honest with you, I so prefer this movie than I did not musical (and am kicking myself that I did not go and see Rowan Atkinson). Oh, yeah, and I suspect that Tarantino may have picked up a thing or two with regards to the use of violence because some of the scenes in this movie are so Tarantino.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

45,tomgillespie2002,One of the greatest comedies ever made,10,14 August 2011,"This is one of those films that I can't believe I had never seen before now. Also on this list are the likes of It's A Wonderful Life and The Great Escape, but they will be seen all in good time. It's a shame I had waited so long to be honest, as it is quite possibly the most hilarious and brilliant comedy I've ever seen. There's not much to say about Monty Python that hasn't already been said, but it is well known that the group (John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam, Michael Palin) were revolutionaries in the art of comedy, combining a number of elements to create an overall surreal and ingenious sense of humour.The film is based loosely on the legend of King Arthur (Chapman) and the Knights of the Round Table. Arthur is on a quest to find the Holy Grail, and with his fellow Knights, encounters a number of dangerous and ridiculous obstacles along the way. These include a castle guarded by French knights with 'outrageous accents', the Black Knight, the Knights Who Say Ni, the Three-Headed Giant, the Rabbit of Caebannog, and the Beast of Arrrrrrggggghhhhh.Whereas Life of Brian was a very intelligent and quite biting satire on religion, Holy Grail is pretty much just an excuse to be extremely silly. From the opening scene, where Arthur arrives pretending to ride on his imaginary horse while his squire bangs two coconuts together to make a galloping noise, you know that the film is not going to play by any comedy rules, and is certainly not afraid of being just plain weird. It plays out in an episodic structure, much like The Flying Circus, but the team are clearly at their most comfortable here and are certainly no slouches when it comes to comedy set-pieces. My favourite would probably be the famous Black Knight, who when Arthur has hacked three of his limbs in a brilliantly gruesome manner, is still trying to fight (""'tis but a scratch!"").The comedy comes from all angles - word-play, visual gags, surrealism, post-modernism, blink-or-you'll-miss-it background gags, and simply pulling silly faces - and they come thick and fast, and include more laughs per minute that most comedies will be lucky to muster in 90 minutes. This is simply a brilliant film, and will forever remain amongst the greatest comedies ever created.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
46,didi-5,"""zany madcap humour""",6,10 August 2003,"Arthur, King of the Britons, who doesn't have a horse and instead bangs coconuts together to fool his subjects into thinking he has, decides to amass a rag-bag of knights to his Round Table - the daredevil Lancelot, the pure Galahad, the foolish Bedevere, the cowardly Robin.  God (in wonderful cartoon form) then challenges him to find the Holy Grail - cue the split stories as each knight has their own 'adventure' whilst trying to locate the precious relic.This being Python it is obviously going to be very silly.  The Knights Who Say 'Ni!' are one of the highlights, as is the exceptionally camp prince (Terry Jones) who is in a tall tower waiting to be rescued, the killer bunny rabbit, and Sir Robin's band of minstrels.  Graham Chapman plays Arthur in a quasi-Shakespearean fashion which at least makes the character memorable, and there are neat cameos from the likes of Connie Booth and Carol Cleveland, both honorary Pythons from the BBC TV series.It isn't a perfect movie and isn't consistently funny - however as a send-up of historical epics it does the job very well.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
47,johnnyboyz,It stands the test of time.,7,13 July 2006,"Whether you love it or hate it, Monty Python is forever etched into British comedy history and this edition of the filmic Python exploits has stood the test of time, just.The thing with Monty Python is that it's very random. The bizarreness and variedness of the humour is really something to behold and there are numerous examples in this film alone which backs this up. Whether it's a completely random and insane discussion-come-argument about swallows to a really scathing, surreal attack on how the English dealt with the 'black death' or the 'plague' or whatever killer virus' were going around back then, in the carefree manner that is shown. It can be a joy to behold.With this film, we are instantly thrown into a world of confusion as the 'projectionist' actually loads up the wrong film to begin with. From here, you know something's up as no other film that I've ever seen or heard of has a beginning like this and you know that this is going to be different. Once the real film has started, the dialogue in the early scenes superbly juxtaposes the setting in 900 odd B.C. as political arguments and, as I've mentioned, discussions about migratory birds pop up. It feels like an extra long episode of a comic, sketch TV programme which has no real plot, but is just a montage of jokes and hilarious situations the characters find themselves in and this isn't a bad thing. The great thing about this is, is that the early situations and exchanges work as a flame for us, the moths, and it sets the stage very well; drawing us into the world of humour on show. Since no one around now knows exactly what happened in the time of the films setting, no one can argue whether any of this would really happen. Were minstrels who followed people/knights around that annoying? What did knights guarding the turrets of castles actually do/talk about to pass the time? Swallows maybe? Effective little scenarios like this make you wonder and it just adds to the genius of the writing.One of the early scenes has to be one of the funniest in films entire one hundred year plus history. This is the fight scene between Arthur and the black knight. Following on from a good fight scene, the black knight delivers some of the funniest lines in the most funniest of ways following his own decapitation. The line: 'All right, we'll call it a draw.' has me in stitches just thinking about it.One quarrel I have with the film is the animated sequences. Now, they look terribly dated and really aren't that funny. Fortunately, they only last a few seconds (most of them) and don't distract you too much but why even bother to have them in the first place? The titles in-between the knight's own separate stories are fine but little things like the 'artist suddenly having a heart attack' just insult the viewer. Not good, unfortunately.I think most people would have a problem with the characters who talk to the screen, breaking the 'fourth wall', something which was stamped out of narrative film-making decades ago. I had a minor frustration with this as although it only happened twice from memory, it spoilt what was a perfectly good/funny scene. The incident in the castle full of young girls is the one which immediately springs to mind as she starts talking to the audience. In an analytical sense, this is actually supposed to add to the experience in the sense that it's all theatre anyway and this film shouldn't be taken seriously. It's fun and farcical and that's all that matters. I didn't let it get away with it when it came to the rating, though.This film's great to watch alone, especially if you've not seen it either before or for a very long time. If you've never experienced Python before, then this is a great appetiser and remember  there are two other films and plenty of TV series' as-well.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

If it's not John Cleese as the taunting Frenchman or said in that very same obnoxiously fake French accent, it's about as funny as missing tea time.""The Holy Grail,"" far and away the greatest comedic work of the Monty Python gang of Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, John Cleese, Michael Palin and Terry Gilliam is a masterful example of the power of improvisational humor and satire. It is also testament that nonsense, when executed properly, is brilliance.No comedy can even touch what King Arthur and the knights of the round table's divinely charged quest for the Holy Grail does. Whether it is a rant about various forms of government, a tragically flawed scientific logic for burning witches or knights who keep sacred words like ""Ni"" and demand shrubberies, just about everything in the film is memorable, quotable or at least highly enjoyed by those with bad recall abilities.The Middle Ages is perfect fodder for Monty Python, mixing a definite sense of history with tales of fantasy -- the ideal balance for satire and nonsensical fun. But truly, comedy is about timing and execution and no one does it better. The subtleties of ""I'm not dead yet"" and ""i'm getting better"" are examples. Delivered in another way they could miss the mark entirely, but the Python crew gets just about anything to be funny. A definite improvisational element keeps the scenes fresh and all the more hilarious.""Holy Grail"" nails joke after joke and only lacks a satisfying end. Still, the sheer comedic genius of the rest of the film is so good that the whole unit is meaningless. You don't walk away thinking it's a bad ending, you start quoting the taunting Frenchman, or the leader of the nights who say ""Ni!"" or the Black Knight.

51,Vartiainen,Comedy masterpiece,10,11 July 2014,"Probably the most well-known work of the British comedy troupe Monty Python, next to Life of Brian. It has endured for almost three decades now and is still considered to be one of the best comedies ever made. And for a good reason. Everything that made Monty Python great is present in this film, their first full-length feature film: the absurd situations, the clever wordplays, the willingness to stretch joke as far as needed, the hilariously incompetent characters, the nonplussed deliveries, the whole package.What separates this film from many modern comedies is its intelligence and poise. Certainly some of the humour is a touch lowbrow and/or silly, but some of it is extremely intelligent and depends on the viewer being able to follow the situation and the dialogues. I also enjoy how they've managed to reach the feel of Arthurian times through costuming and illustrations. Most of the humour is also patently absurd. And yet it all fits together strangely well. One of the hallmarks of British comedy is stoic delivery. The characters never think they're saying something funny, rather they just happen to live in this bizarre world. There's never a sense of winking at the audience with this group, which is much better in my opinion.This is my favourite comedy film by far. It's very quotable, every single joke makes me at least crack a smile, the whole story is strangely compelling and as a whole it's just a blast to sit through every now and then. A beloved classic for a reason. See it. Arthur, your king, compels you!",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
52,FiendishDramaturgy,A Masterpiece.,10,31 December 2003,"Monty Python takes a bit of getting used to, as their comedy company is somewhat of an acquired taste for most Americans who aren't accustomed to the dry British wit featured in these movies. However, they are absolute geniuses of comedy, as is demonstrated here in their first full-length feature film, ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail."" There are excellent and memorable lines, hilarious dialog, and intentionally cheesy acting, combined to give you the laugh of the Dark Ages.King Arthur and his lowest-budgeted knights set off on their legendary quest for the Holy Grail. What they find, instead, is series of mishaps, antics, and outright hilariously idiotic stumbling-blocks.I highly suggest seeing this on the Special Edition DVD (KILLER RABBIT-ON!).

53,hellraiser7,Fractured Fantasy,10,16 June 2014,"The King Arthur legend is no doubt one of my favorite fantasies and throughout the years there have been multiple interpretations of the legend in the visual medium, so good and some bad but all the same that legend like so many other stories has lived on even to this day. I was even fascinated with the concept of lost/undiscovered relics and the Holy Grail of course is one of them, let alone on a side note I'm a Christian. Parodies comedies are another thing I really love and when I heard that there was a parody on this legend, I had to check it out and I wasn't disappointed. This film is one of my favorite comedies, parodies in the sub genre, but also one of my favorite films in general. On a side note this was the film that got me into the ""Monty Python Flying Circus"" skit show which at the time I never heard about.There's really not much to say, this is one of those parodies that are done right like in most parodies it takes a story and turns it upside down and on it's head, while the characters all play it straight all unaware their in a parody. The whole flying circus ensemble are all in the film and they all as usual do a great job at making us laugh let alone, the fact they all play multiple roles in the movie.Both the verbal and visual jokes are just fraking hilarious. Though I wouldn't say everyone of them are hits, like that whole verbal joke on swallows I always thought was boring but that's me. But that's what you get with most comedies and parodies, it's the ones that hit that count the most. Like in their skit show, each of the jokes are hilarious because of how smart or strange they really are; let alone how the film isn't afraid to go the extra mile sometimes with it's blood and violence which was revolutionary for it's time, it's now common in shows like ""South Park"".There are so many scenes that are just memorable that I don't want to give them all away. From the introduction of the Holy Hand Grenade it's pretty much a verbal and visual joke going together, from the fact the item has a biblical passage, let alone it even exists in the Christian faith at all. But of course my favorite scene is The Tale of Sir Lancelot, where we see Lancelot battling. Well OK, I wouldn't really call it a battle, it was more of a slaughter as we see Lance is just constantly killing everyone in the castle not even stopping to take a breath, what makes it really hilarious is the fact that no one is putting up any resistance they've all practically set themselves up to be killed. I even love that swashbucking music which makes the sequence both exciting and all the more hilarious because it reflects just how crazy things really are.I love how in a way the film itself is a character, from it's fourth wall breaking to just how aware of how low budget the film is made. Like the whole pretend horse thing which is hilarious because you easily see the person making the film is a complete money grubber that he didn't want to shell the money to buy real horses. Though all the same it's just hilarious how the actors for pretend horses still perform really well, as if they really are on horses. Let alone the ending which cracks me up because it's a payoff to a really strange subplot that's been going on, the subplot seemed like another episode from some procedural show. You could say it's if the procedural shows like ""CSI"", ""NCIS"", or any other you can think of ever crossed over with a fantasy story which when you think about is kinda a crazy but cool concept.This film like the legend of the grail is ageless.Rating: 4 stars",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

Mr Chapman was still with us,although already an alcoholic,in 1975 when ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" was released.In the 32 years that have passed since then,the film has acquired a reputation -particularly in the U.S. where Pythonmania seems rampant - that far exceeds its merits. Put succinctly,it is nowhere near as funny as the cast thinks it is and they are nowhere near as clever as they think they are. Much of the humour is ""hommaged"" from sources as diverse as The Goon Show and,er,...The Goon Show.Much of the rest can be traced back to the Marx Bros,British Music Hall and radio stars and ""Hellzapoppin'"".

56,st-shot,A Unique and Original Comedy Classic,10,11 August 2007,"In spite of Viet Nam, Watergate and gas shortages the 70's was a period of superb film humor. Giants like Woody Allen and Mel Brooks were in their prime and British export Monty Python had established a beach front on American television. When the Python's released their first feature length film audiences expected waves of absurdity and ""silliness"". They received more. Based (or spring boarded) on the Arthurian legend of the quest for the Holy Grail, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is screamingly hilarious from its opening credits to its final scene. Coconuts, killer rabbits, flying cows and holy hand grenades fill the landscape as the Python troupe immerse themselves in multiple roles, skewering legend and establishment with their surreal brand of humor. They all shine individually but Cleese as dimwitted Lancelot, Tim the Enchanter, a witch burner and a castle guard with an ""outrageous French accent"" is most memorable for me. There is also the creative collage animation of Terry Gilliam which fits seamlessly into the zaniness of the location footage by transitioning without a break in storyline or humor from one knight's adventure to the next. In addition to its abundance of original non-stop laughs, attention to detail in ambiance and composition (Gilliam directed the camera work, Terry Jones the actors) gives Grail an impressive look. Castles, forests, a Viking Ship are photographed in epic style giving the film a high gloss while at the same time heightening the comic absurdity. I was a year out of college when Grail was released. I had no steady job and no prospects but I saw this film eight times in that year (a personal record to this day) and that alone made it a very good year.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
57,MaxBorg89,WHAT is the capital of Assyria? I don't know that!,10,28 March 2006,"I do know, however, that Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of the funniest movies ever made. Let's face it, if the Python hadn't showed up in 1969, someone would have created them by now, or the world would be a much sadder place. Alongside Life of Brian, which is the sextet's masterpiece, Holy Grail is an excellent start if you want to get addicted to their surreal humor.As suggested in the title, the film deals with the Arthurian stories, freely reinterpreted by the Python ensemble: after recruiting his knights, including Sir Lancelot (John Cleese), Sir Robin (Eric Idle), Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones) and Sir Galahad (Michael Palin), King Arthur (Graham Chapman) embarks on a mission from God (also Chapman, voice only though): to seek and find the Holy Grail. No need to say, the journey is going to be perilous, but also hilarious, our heroes doing their ""best"" to screw everything up.As in Life of Brian, there are so many good bits choosing just one or two feels reductive and disrespectful, given the material. It's pure comedy gold from start to finish, a non-stop gag marathon: from the mock Scandinavian subtitles in the opening credits to the argument about swallows, from the Killer Rabbit to the Black Knight and the jaw-dropping epilogue, you will keep grinning like never before (if you're unfamiliar with these comedians, that is). Actually, after some serious thinking I can select two particular sequences as particularly memorable: the Knights who say ""Ni!"" and the Bridge of Death. The rest of the film is ace too, but those two scenes are the ones I can't stop thinking of fondly whenever the movie is mentioned.Oh, and let's not forget Terry Gilliam's vital contribution: he doesn't appear that much as an actor (his Bridgekeeper is absolute genius, though), but he compensates that with the remarkable animations used to depict part of this epic adventure. Speaking of epic, this picture has one of the most brilliant tag-lines in comedy history, if not film history in general.Oh yes, the world wouldn't be quite the same without the Monty Python.

In this movie, they also don't seem to be extremely concerned with disgusting their audience but rather making them laugh.  The 'Meaning of Life' had many disgusting scenes and 'Life of Brian' wanted to slap religion in the face from beginning to end.  Here we get British comedy at it's best with Python's weird mix of animation, live action, and interaction with the audience of some sort.

Monty Python keeps pounding and pounding you with gag after gag, and lead you down a road, but suddenly its a bridge, no, its an ocean. One of the things that really makes this hilarious is the grand spectacle that dazzles you with attention to grand sound effects, and then the next scene may be purposely cheap sets, all to make you laugh yourself to death. There is crude humor, and what I think can fairly be described as dark humor-you might not think its funny to see an animal with big teeth rip several knights to death, or a knight have his arms and legs cut off, but Monty Python will make you laugh at it. I personally think they're akin to Marx Brothers comedy, or Mel Brooks-hilarious with likable people in outrageous situations.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
60,slokes,Should have been the start of something bigger...,7,2 October 2003,"After establishing themselves as the Beatles of Comedy on their five-year UK television run, the six-member comedy troupe better known as Monty Python made their move to film with this clever, genre-bending spoof of Arthurian legend. In a better world, it would have kicked off a long series of similar Python films, of satires and broad comedies at a pace of one every two or three years, some better, some worse, but all beloved in the same vein as this.I feel in an odd spot here, saying ""Holy Grail"" is not that great on the one hand and I wish there had been more on the other. But there's a logic stream here. I think the Pythons were on to something, a formula they could have enriched over time. The movie was clearly the work of novices; accomplished comedic actors and hilarious writers yes, but stark newbies on the big screen. The film's texture is as muddy as a Super 8 home movie in places, the action is choppy, and the plot line sags when it should grow taut. I get the feeling the film draws away deliberately from letting us like the individual characters because it disrupts the aesthetic (or as Lancelot would say, the idiom) in which Python works, but this morbid and depressing style grates over time. And then there's that wicked stupid ending, as bad a one as any good film ever had.These are flaws lesser than the film's virtues, which are some brilliant comedy sequences, an eye for period detail and squalor, and a terrific musical score. The no-horse joke is dragged on past the point of obviousness and idiocy to a place by the end that's almost sublime, and it's as much a testament to the comic courage of the Pythons than any of their later icon-bashing. What's bad here are minor by contrast, and the sort of things more accomplished filmmakers would improve upon with subsequent efforts, talky bits, jumpy segues, and the like. Indeed, Python did just that when they made their next film, ""Life Of Brian,"" which actually works as a story in a way ""Holy Grail"" doesn't, though minus the same broad humor, but then the Pythons went to seed in the 80s, traipsing off into solo projects and one lame sketch-comedy knockoff, ""Meaning Of Life,"" before we lost Graham Chapman to AIDS and that was that.MPATHG works very well for the first 20 minutes or so, setting the scene of Britain circa 932 AD, then loses altitude like a coconut-laden swallow as it takes on the Grail quest legends, before screeching to a silly halt with a ending that deserves a spoiler if any film ever did. Episodic bits work well in isolation, often very well, but don't gel the way they should. There's some great episodes, the duel with the Black Knight, the faceoffs with Knights who say Ni, the quests of Galahad and Lancelot, and the finale at the Bridge of Death (""oh, great""). The part I enjoy most is Robin's relationship with his minstrels, perhaps the worst spin doctors a leader could have (though he certainly deserves them.)Picking out the individual members for applause seems an exercise in perversity, but Michael Palin shines as Galahad, the lead Ni Knight, and especially the father of Prince Herbert (""This is supposed to be a happy occasion. Let's not bicker and argue over who killed who."") Also, Chapman is solid in the lead role, and one almost wishes we were really allowed to root for the guy. (Hard to believe Chapman was reportedly soused for much of the filming. He seems rock-steady.)The great thing about this movie is you don't have to be a Python fan to enjoy it. You can actually have a happy family life, normal adult friends, and no special aptitude for Jeopardy or Trivial Pursuit. Holy Grail doesn't deserve the biggest cult following this side of Sun Yung Moon, but it's merry and more than adequate for what it tries to be. I can't help feeling it could just have been the beginning of so much more.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

62,EUyeshima,Python Silliness Still Holds Up in Special Two-Disc Set,8,5 March 2006,"With the opening of Mike Nichols' and Eric Idle's ""Spamalot"" on Broadway last month, it's a good time to revisit the 1975 comedy classic that inspired the musical. Thirty years have elapsed since its original release, but it is still a movie that veers wildly back and forth between hilariously inventive and downright silly. If you can hold on tight, it's a worthwhile ride. Almost arbitrarily about a band of adventurers looking for the famed Holy Grail, the movie is just an excuse to create a nonsensical world steeped in medieval history and comically ironic violence. Directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, it is typical Monty Python fare, which means a lot of clever wordplay and elaborate sight gags with big payoffs. The story begins with King Arthur and his page Patsy galloping on their invisible horses with their clapping coconut half-shells, as they search for worthy knights to take back to Camelot. From there, we meet a cast of characters that only makes sense in Python-land: an increasingly armless and legless Black Knight with a chip on his shoulder, a big Trojan Horse-like wooden rabbit, some disrespectful Frenchmen, castle-bound nymphomaniac maidens, the knights who dare to say ""Ni!"", a pedantic historian in the present day and even God, who seems rather impatient with the befuddled knights as He explains their quest for the Holy Grail. Amid these disparate elements, the film holds together as a clever satire on blind pious ignorance and the unquestioning acceptance of organized religion. The pacing gets sluggish toward the end, but the conclusion is riotous and just in time.Well packaged, the two-disc set has several extras. The main menu on the first disc is funny in itself with an option for the hard of hearing. There are two alternative commentary tracks. The first is newer and features Idle, John Cleese and Michael Palin; the second was recorded much earlier with Gilliam and Jones. Both are informative but only fitfully funny since they defer to the movie. The second disc has ""Mindless Sing-Alongs!"", where three scenes are taken from the film and subtitled so that once can sing along to the amusing ""Knights of the Round Table"" (which inspired the Broadway show title, ""We dine well here in Camelot, we eat ham and jam and spam a lot.""), ""Sir Robin"" or chant along in ""Monk's Chant"". There is a hysterical little ""educational"" short entitled ""How to Use Your Coconut"" and two scenes dubbed in Japanese. But the highlight is a 45-minute documentary called ""The Quest for the Holy Grail Locations,"" in which Jones and Palin explore the various film locations with humor and a sense of deserved nostalgia. Other features include a mock interview with the cast done during the filming, a Lego version of ""The ""Knights of the Round Table"" song and various sundry features suitable primarily for a Pythonite. For non-Pythonites, the film is still worth a look at a comedy that only looks better with all the witless dreck produced now.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

I've seen it a few times and just never have the uproarious laughter that everyone else seems to experience. Still, despite not loving it myself, I can certainly recognize that there is clever, pertinent and prescient commentary on the world. It's also impossible to ignore the pop cultural impact it's had.

64,ShootingShark,The Black Knight Always Triumphs !,8,26 September 2013,"In England in 932AD, King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table are charged with a sacred quest to find the Holy Grail of biblical legend. However, if they should doubt their courage or their strength, death awaits them all with nasty big pointy teeth ...Made for the vast sum of £229,575, this comic cult classic is one of the funniest and most original movies ever made. The combination of the weird, zany, shocking, argumentative, stream-of-consciousness humour of the Monty Python troupe within the historical context of Arthurian legend is simply brilliant. The Pythons are able to simultaneously create a visually exciting movie of medieval times but then break all the rules about how such movies should play out. Typical example - the coconuts idea is a great visual joke based on budgetary limitations (they couldn't afford any horses) which they also turned into a hilarious opening scene where they bicker over the anachronistic existence of tropical fruit in Anglo-Saxon Britain. The movie is both great fun to watch in of itself, but also even more fun to laugh at as a satire of historical/action/period films in general (such as the ""bad editing"" joke when Sir Lancelot storms Swamp Castle). The dialogue is priceless throughout, with gags ranging from the cerebral to the gloriously offensive, but perhaps most importantly the film has a truly inspired sense of the visual - the Black Knight sequence, the Trojan Rabbit, the dreaded Cave Of Caerbannog, and many other great moments. This is the only Python movie directed by both the Terrys, and it combines the best qualities of Jones' character comedy with Gilliam's artist's perspective. If it has one limitation, it's that a few scenes feel like individual sketches within the larger film, but the episodic nature of the story covers this quite nicely. Everybody is terrific in it and Palin and Idle possibly win a joint award for most characters played in a feature, with at least seven speaking parts each. I especially like Gilliam as The Old Man From Scene 24. The Pythons only made four movies (five if you count the Hollywood Bowl concert), all of which are terrific but have different strengths and weaknesses. This one is perhaps the most fun and (despite its cult credentials) the most accessible, and is not to be missed. Shot mostly in Scotland, notably at Doune Castle in Perthshire and Castle Stalker in Argyll, this makes a great double-bill with John Boorman's Excalibur, but make sure you watch the Monty Python film second. And always remember, just walk away from any French people taunting you.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
65,davidmvining,Hilarious and perfectly constructed,10,10 February 2020,"Watching this for the first time in at least ten years, it became screamingly obvious to me which sections were directed by Terry Gilliam and which were directed by Terry Jones. Jones tends to set up his camera from afar, capturing all of the actors in a single shot and letting them perform. Gilliam pieces his parts together from many smaller parts, individually gathered with more interesting angles and compositions. They both have their charms, and they end up working really well as a whole because while the visual aesthetic may be different between the two directors, there's a common comedic approach that crosses that visual barrier and comes together as a whole and hilarious experience.While the experience is a whole, it's obviously built from smaller parts that stem from a group of comedians more in tune with the formula of sketch comedy. The intelligent approach was to use a story (the quest for the Holy Grail) which lent itself to branching off in a few different directions for a time, allowing isolated bits of comedy, before bringing it all back to one conclusion.The movie is largely broken into three sections. The first is Arthur building his team (which really only accounts for his finding of Bedivere, everyone else gets summarized). The second is the knights going off in different directions to look for the grail. The third brings them all back to finish out the adventure (with the group getting smaller by the second for different reasons).What makes the movie work, though, is the comedy. The comedy stems from the funny dialogue but also from the contrast between the serious look of the material against the inherent silliness of the comedy. Terry Gilliam called it ""laughing at castles"". They had to film very cheaply, and one of the cheapest ways to film is to simply go outside. Living in a country as verdant and richly foliaged as England, while also populated with castles that have stood there for hundreds of years. Just going there gave the film instant production values that they could never get close to replicated on sets. It's the contrast there that's the source of much of the comedy.Graham Chapman plays Arthur very seriously for most of the film, offering only scattered moments of befuddlement at the most ridiculous of circumstances. He's the straight man, and his reactions are mostly the source of his own comedy. Terry Jones plays Bedivere as a nebbish knight who should probably not be in armor while being very sure of his grasp of the most advanced scientific knowledge. John Cleese is Lancelot, a mindlessly brave hero who runs into every situation ready to deal with it using his sword. Michael Palin is Galahad, the purest of the pure. Eric Idle plays Sir Robin, the most cowardly of the cowards. The characters aren't deep. They're meant as personifications of specific types that the Pythons use to direct jokes at, and it works exceedingly well.I think it's most obvious in the middle section, when the knights split up, to see where the humor comes from. Robin the coward is faced with certain death. Galahad the pure is faced with certain temptation. Lancelot the brave is put in a situation where his bravery is wildly out of place. They're the sorts of adventures heroes defined by singular traits go on in straight adventure tales, but here everything's turned on their heads. Robin doesn't become brave, he remains cowardly, running away. Galahad decides that a little bit of temptation will be fine (only to be bravely saved by the brave Sir Lancelot at the last second). Lancelot is so blinded by his need for adventure that he murders half a wedding party to get to a waifish young prince who doesn't really need the rescuing he desires.It's the contrasts and the inherent silliness that makes the film. That extends even further to the presence of the French, everything animated, the knights who say Ni, and the movie's ending.Oh, the ending. I think it's perfect. In a movie built on setting expectations of a retelling of the Arthurian legend upside down, setting up a giant battle (with an army that appears out of nowhere) only to have it end with Arthur and Bedivere carried away in a modern police paddy wagon is great. It's the exact sort of undermining of expectations that the movie has embraced from beginning to that very end.So, it's a patchwork that is designed to work as a patchwork. It's tightly crafted humor at the hands of two surprisingly firm directorial hands (each in their first attempts) with varying styles that merge together really well. It's beautiful to look at, using the most out of their location shooting. It's fast at a quick 90 minutes, and it's consistently funny throughout. You don't need me to tell you, but this is a greatly crafted comedy.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

A lot of the humour in the film is quite dry as is most of British comedy, and some of it takes a moment to process, so if you don't mind the Brits or thinking about a joke this film is for you. Obviously not all the jokes are thought-provoking, some of them are just plain stupid, which is great because it goes well with the film as a whole. We follow the Knights on their quest for the Holy Grail as they fight the French, battle against temptation, fight an evil rabbit, encounter the black knight, and the knights that say ""Ni"". Will they accomplish their quest to obtain the Holy Grail? Or will they fall short because of some heinous murder? Only time and you watching the film can find out.

70,gangstahippie,"Overrated? Yes, but still very funny and memorable.",9,3 February 2010,"Monty Python and The Holy Grail has been listed by many as one of the greatest comedies of all time.First time watching this film, I sort of liked it, but I thought it was very overrated, and I didn't think it was as funny as everybody said it was.After watching it another time, I still think it's overrated, but I like it more.The plot involves the members of the Monty Python comedy troupe as knights searching for the holy grail.Along the way, they each encounter many weird and funny obstacles.This movie has some very memorable scenes such as the ""Knights Who Say...NI"", a killer bunny rabbit, the black knight who just won't admit defeat(even after all his limbs are cut off) and many others.Yes, a lot of the comedy is fairly stupid, but you will still find it funny.This film is very entertaining. and also has a few interesting Terry Gilliam animations just like the TV series did.The film has a huge cult following as of now.I found it very funny, just not as uproarious as everybody claims it is.It does however, get better after watching it a few more times!

71,winner55,masterpiece of satirical film-making,10,14 October 2007,"Much of the work by the Python crew has dated badly, looking more weird than funny. Much of the best of it is a manic-depressive's visualization of the old radio ""Goon Show""; the innovations the Pythons brought to their material are really drawn from Beckett and Ionesco and other playwrights of the ""Theater of the Absurd"", which had exhausted itself by the time the Pythons turned it into pure comedy, thus reviving it for one last go around.""The Holy Grail"" is the exception to this general historical trajectory. There are two reasons for this: 1) Plot. There are actually two plots here: one is the search for the Grail, the other only makes its appearance in brief (but important) episodes - yet this is actually the grounding plot of the film.Basically, someone is making a movie for television about Arthur and the Holy Grail. They don't have much money to spend, so they touch up the legend a bit to add some violence, titillation, and even magic, although they can't afford decent special effects. (So they're reduced to fighting a rabbit rather than a dragon). However, to give their project credibility, they hire a historian to jabber platitudes to cover up the holes in their plot-line. However, one of the cast goes crazy and kills the historian. After a brief investigation, the police decide to arrest the whole lot.This double plot development works very well, largely because it is accomplished through purely cinematic methods - editing, camera angles, etc. - rather through any exposition.2) Theme. ""The Holy Grail"" was released more than a year before the appearance of the Sex Pistols punk band, but the Pythons are clearly on the same wave-length as the Pistols here. There has never been an approach to the ""legendary past"" of Great Britain so viciously and energetically iconoclastic as this. It's impossible to laugh your way through this film and then find anything half-way believable in ""Camelot"" or ""Exclaibur"" or ""Sword in the Stone."" It's not by chance that, since the making of this film, the Arthur legend has had to be seriously revised until the films concerning it have become little more than sci-fi fantasies without the science. We know now what the ancient Britons were - mud-wallowing, lice-infested dullards, with ""knights"" who were only interested in loot and rapine. (Let the Disney people make a movie about that!) Over all, then, this remains a great one-off masterpiece of satirical film-making. That the Pythons never bettered it only makes it all the more remarkable.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
72,screenman,Not Half So Funny As Some Appear To Think,6,8 July 2012,"By the time of this movie's release, the Python team had already passed from being new and experimental, and into mainstream comedy. But in doing so, they re-defined humour for a whole generation.Therefore, one might have expected this production to have been a little more polished than it is, even allowing for the spontaneous anarchy that was part of their style. However, this is not the case. At times it seems quite sloppy, and indeed rather boring.I can recollect, in my youth, finding many things to laugh at when I first saw this production nearly 40 years ago. It had the great Python team going like stokers and lots of silly and surreal moments. Today, with my older, and perhaps drier, humour; things seem very different. I recently purchased (second-hand) the double-DVD special edition, and wanted desperately to rekindle that original spark, if only for 'old time's sake'. Sadly; it just wasn't there.Occasional smirk-worthy moments could still be found - like the time when Arthur inadvertently 'oppresses' an opinionated surf, or the knight who never accepts defeat even when his limbs have been hacked off - but for the most part it seems pretty lame. Such is the resonance of 'Python' humour, even worldwide, that I found myself making-up excuses for its lack of appeal. For many, Monty Python has itself become the Holy Grail of comedy. Well, it isn't. And this work has more the amateurish appearance of a hastily cobbled together piece of footlights hokum. Something to engage the smug self-righteousness of drunken under-graduates.Many things the Monty Python team created have indeed become standard-bearers of comedy greatness. But not everything was good. Objective and critical scrutiny must admit that some of their stuff could be pretty lousy. That's inevitable. The later, much more polished, 'Life Of Brian' was not only ground-breaking in its assault upon flatulent institutions, it's still downright funny, and remains an insightful analysis of human foibles.'Brian' has stood the test of time, but 'The Holy Grail' is no more than what it represents itself to be - a failed search.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
73,brando647,A Comedy Legend; I Love It,9,23 February 2012,"I've noticed that Monty Python is one of the most polarizing franchises I've encountered. A lot of people I know either love it or hate it, with few falling somewhere in between. I consider myself a casual fan. I've seen some of the television series, and I absolutely love HOLY GRAIL. For the record, I've never seen LIFE OF BRIAN and I've only seen bits and pieces of MEANING OF LIFE (and it didn't grab me the same way HOLY GRAIL did). Honestly, the first time I saw this movie I didn't really care for it. Absurdist humor hadn't really been my thing at the time, but the movie grew on me. Next thing I knew, I was buying my own copy, watching it multiple times, and planning on seeking out the rest of the Monty Python films. What's the movie about? It's all right there in the title: the story of the Holy Grail as seen through the eyes of some of the funniest men to come out of Britain. King Arthur (Graham Chapman) is tasked by God to search the lands for the mystical Holy Grail. Aiding him in his quest are Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Bedevere, Sir Galahad the Pure, and Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, and their quest will take them to the far reaches of the land where they will encounter beautiful maidens, dangerous evils, and, well, the French. The whole movie is as if a Monty Python sketch was extended to a feature runtime, but unlike an SNL skit receiving the same treatment, it works.This movie is hilarious. That's all there is to it. I've watched it a half dozen times and it never gets old. It ages perfectly, too. It may have been made in the mid-70s, but the fact that it's meant to be a goofy low-budget comedy means that aging special effects don't mean a thing as long as it continues to make people laugh. Even people who haven't seen the movie have probably heard its dialogue quoted ad nauseam (""'Tis but a scratch!"") or would recognize the Knights Who Say Ni! Skip around the lawn while clacking a couple of empty coconut shells and most people will get the joke, while the rest will probably just think you've lost your mind. MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL is a classic at the pinnacle of many top ten lists for favorite comedies. Terry Gilliam, John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin are comedic geniuses. You've got to give them serious credit for being able to put together such a hilarious film while at the same time doing 99% of the speaking roles in the films themselves. There isn't a whole lot I can say about this movie short of showering it with love.

On a meager budget of 229,000 pounds (approx. $500,000), Python schools Hollywood on the Shakespearean value of playing all the parts yourselves, attending to authenticity in set dressing and costuming, and using really, really silly voices.The first feature film from Monty Python (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, Michael Palin  five Englishmen and American Gilliam) would change the course of the comedy river as dramatically as Moses parted the Red Sea. Their arsenic-laced British television series *Monty Python's Flying Circus* (1969-1974) was the zenith of left-turn comedic outrage (in their lifetime, spawning the adjective ""Pythonesque"") and *Holy Grail* hailed the zenith of the troupe's creativity, capturing lightning in a parrot cage.King Arthur (Chapman) is empowered by God to seek the Holy Grail, thus surrounding his royal person with the Knights of the Round Table, Sir Lancelot (Cleese), Sir Galahad (Palin), Sir Bedevere (Jones), Sir Robin (Idle) and, with his trusted steed, Patsy (Gilliam, clopping coconuts together simulating hoofbeats), he rides toward Camelot Camelotwhere the Knights of the Round Table ""dance whene'er we're able"" and ""eat ham and jam and Spam a lot.,"" which Arthur surmises is ""a silly place"" and avoids, instead journeying with his troop through forests rank with evil, encountering the contempt of French soldiers at Castle Guy de Lombard (who taunt Arthur's ""Ke-niggits"" most hurtfully), refrain from the sensuality of all-female Castle Anthrax (where Galahad The Chaste is rescued - somewhat unwillingly - from The Oral Sex), fall into nefarious service of The Knights Who Say Ni (though Arthur provides a well-tended shrubbery as payment, cutting down the mightiest tree in the forest with a herring is asking too much); past sentinels who will not let them pass, allying with Tim the Enchanter, battling a killer rabbit with the Holy Hand Grenade, fleeing the Legendary Black Beast of Aaaaaargh, muddling their questions at the Bridge of Death with the Old Man from Scene 24 and ultimately crossing the Gorge of Eternal Peril.Educated, lucid, atheistic, amoral, Monty Python could and did attack every taboo held by the stiff upper crust to the working class alike. Though many have tried - from America's *Saturday Night Live* to Britain's *League of Gentlemen*, with Canada's *Kids In The Hall* brushing up against the magic before their untimely dissolution - retrospect has proved what a *sui generis* troupe Python was.Of course, if you don't ""get"" British humor (i.e. REAL humor) or if you don't ""get"" Monty Python (for which there is no reason to continue living), let's not bicker and argue over who killed who; you should wait here until I come and get him And no singing!

The cheapness of this movie,coupled with the Pythonesque sense of silliness,fills in the rest of the way here.One who sees this movie must be forewarned: this movie will only truly appeal to those who are willing to throw out their sense of a linear plot in favor of an almost sketch-comedy sensibility. There will be some that may find this film annoying,and that's probably what the creators thought was going to happen anyway.

85,mattymatt4ever,Again I am part of the small minority,3,30 October 2001,"I was under the assumption that this movie, or one of the ""Monty Python"" movies, was on AFI's list of funniest comedies of all time.  This is probably the movie, since I also see it as Number 53 on the IMDB favorites list.  Why?  Beats me.Now, I have only seen glimpses of the classic ""Monty Python"" show.  I think most of the actors involved have real talent.  I've seen Eric Idle, John Cleese and Michael Palin in other movies and TV shows, and think they are all very talented comedians who are capable of making me laugh hysterically. I don't know if the show is any funnier than this movie, but I hope it is. But now that I saw this movie, I'm not too enthusiastic about checking out the show.I didn't think ""This is Spinal Tap"" or ""Caddyshack""--two gloriously acclaimed comedies that are also on the AFI list--were all that brilliant either.  Again, I am part of the minority.  With those two films, I received angry emails by people saying that the humor flew over my head and I should watch those films again to see if I missed something.  Well, in the case of ""MP and the Holy Grail,"" what the hell did I miss???!!!  Let me see:  we have a Knight that says ""Ni"" and a rabbit that bites people's heads off. Wow!  Subtle!  If those gags flew over my head, then it was for the right reasons.  And worse of all, each gag is stretched out to the point where you just want to punch these actors out.  So you have a lame gag, equipped with a lame setup and lame punchline--let's just rub salt on a wound and repeat it over and over again!  Maybe ""Monty Python"" is an acquired taste.  Maybe I have to watch several episodes of the show to get adjusted to the humor. There has to be some reason why it became one of the most memorable sketch comedies shows, worldwide.  But that still doesn't guarantee I will eventually find humor in these goofy gags.I don't like to stereotype British comedy, because there are in fact some that I find quite funny.  And their humor is not always bland as a certain number of (American) viewers say it is.  I've seen episodes of ""Mr. Bean"" with Rowan Atkinson, and think it is one of the funniest shows I've ever seen.  I also like Atkinson's other show ""The Thin Blue Line"" and ""Keeping Up Appearances"" (I forgot the name of the actress who stars on the show). But the humor in this movie is as bland as bland can get.  Why build a series of elaborate set pieces when all you're going to have are a bunch of characters doing lame VERBAL gags?  Throughout the film, I couldn't help but ponder, ""If only Mel Brooks would've written the script...God, it could've been so much funnier!""  What we have are comedic angles of the tales of such warriors as King Arthur and Robin Hood, and not one satirical jab came to mind?  I'm still a firm believer that there should be a certain element of truth to every joke.  Some good examples are in Mel Brooks' ""Robin Hood: Men in Tights"" when Cary Elwes (playing Robin Hood) says, ""I'm the only Robin Hood who can speak with an English accent"" and when the Chief of Nottingham is portrayed as the Chief of Rottingham.And who came up with the decision to show lots of blood?  I know the violence looks fake, but come on!  This is a comedy!  Again, rubbing salt on a wound.I thought the film was lame from the get-go, from the minute they started that running gag involving King Arthur pretending to ride up to the castle on a horse by having his peasant bang coconut shells together to make it sound like a horse trotting.  But as the film goes along, it gets more and more annoying.  It's only ninety minutes long, but it felt like an eternity. ""Braveheart"" would feel shorter in comparison (because that happens to be a great movie).For those who are fans of the ""Monty Python"" series, you might want to argue my opinions.  And I'm sure you'd probably take my criticisms for granted. But I'm not going to pretend to laugh and pretend I enjoyed the film thoroughly to go along with the bandwagon.  For those who think I'm a comedic snob, I'll tell you what I think is funny.  ""My Cousin Vinny"" is funny.  ""The Big Lebowski"" is funny.  ""Analyze This"" is funny.  Those are only a few of the comedies I find hilarious.  I can go on and on.  If I don't find these boring, repetitive gags funny, then so be it.  Once again, another comedy I have to watch with someone else to actually get an idea of what is supposed to be humorous.My score:  3 (out of 10)",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
86,hall895,Sublime silliness,7,9 June 2011,"Silly boys. Those Monty Python chaps send up the King Arthur legend as only they could. Silliness from beginning to end. But silliness can be brilliant you know. And there is some truly inspired stuff in this movie. It's a farcical parody in which the laughs come fast and furious. You've got a three-headed knight. You've got a knight who just won't quit, no matter how many ""flesh wounds"" you inflict upon him. You have knights who sing about that silly place known as Camelot. And of course you have knights who say ""Ni!"" You have snooty, condescending French persons and their flying livestock. You have rabbits, both Trojan and killer. You have a unique use for coconuts and the question of whether coconuts can migrate. All of this surrounding the main plot, the quest for the Holy Grail. Oh who are we kidding, there really is no plot. The movie just careens from one gag to the next.The movie is brilliantly performed by the Pythons, each of whom takes on multiple roles. Graham Chapman, playing King Arthur, is the glue that holds everything together. All the nonsense revolves around him. Chapman is the straight man, if this movie could be said to have such a thing. Everyone else gets to be gleefully silly while Chapman's Arthur is a little more restrained as he focuses on his noble quest. But Chapman is as funny as any of the others. Arthur's Knights of the Round Table meanwhile are a quirky, eclectic bunch and each provides plenty of laughs as they go off in their own directions seeking the Grail. And for as good as they are portraying their respective Knights it is in the other characters they also play that the Pythons perhaps shine brightest. How can you not love John Cleese's Taunting French Guard? Michael Palin is great as the peasant Dennis who bemoans the class system and questions Arthur's legitimacy. Palin also plays the King of Swamp Castle and Terry Jones does great as heir to the swamp Prince Herbert. Among other things Eric Idle is a great dead collector, shrubber and monk. Terry Gilliam has comparatively little screen time but makes his own contributions with his great animation as well as co-directing the whole thing with Jones. No small task pulling all this film's wonderful nonsense together so Gilliam and Jones have to be given a great deal of credit for their directing work. The movie is really let down only by its ending. It's jarring and abrupt, the Pythons pulling the rug out from beneath their audience. It's typical Python though. But this last bit of silliness doesn't really work. For all the great stuff that came before the movie deserved a better conclusion than this. But a misstep right at the end isn't going to detract too much from the overall experience. This movie is funny, brilliant and thoroughly enjoyable from the opening credits all the way to the end. Well near the end anyway. Easy to see why this is one of the most beloved comedies ever. This movie which sends up the great Arthurian legend has become legendary itself.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
87,educallejero,"With some ups and downs, still really good",7,31 January 2021,"The first 20 minutes are comedy gold, with typical Python intelligence, which means smarts combined with pure silliness in surgical precision, elevating the whole.After that, the movie has 60 minutes of ups and downs, not always overcoming the lack of budget, sometimes overusing the ""breaking the fourth wall"" joke, or just focusing in a less funny joke just a bit too long.Still, overall, it's impossible to say the quality isn't good, because for every bad segment, with get an opposite amazing one. Big step forward from the 1971 film.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
88,aciessi,Let's not go to Camelot. It's a Silly Place.,8,16 March 2019,"Where would comedy be without Monty Python? Well, we wouldn't have had South Park, The Simpsons, Rick and Morty, Tim and Eric, Arrested Development, Saturday Night Live, Anchorman, The Office, Family Guy, Bob's Burgers, Airplane!, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Invader Zim, Aqua Teen Hunger Force and every stupid internet meme ever made. That's quite a lot of things. To the troupe of bloaks who revolutionized comedy by not giving a single F about making sense, we are forever in your debt.This brings us to Monty Python and the Holy Grail. One of the classic comedy movies of the 20th century every film lover must see before they die. You'll either get it, or you won't. You'll either laugh uproariously or scratch your head. Whatever you think of it, you can't argue that it represented an important moment in cinema, comedy, acting and the entire art of storytelling. The world was introduced to absurdism and this film crashes it down on you with it's bare feet.. *Python fans will understand that reference*. What you've got is the entire Monty Python gang dressed up in horrible medieval costumes, prancing about the countryside of England, making a farce of 6th century British history and loving every minute of it. The guerrilla nature of how they put this film together is a total inspiration. By today's standards, this film could have easily been made during a long weekend by a bunch of high school kids on their phones. Monty Python made it all possible. They taught us that jokes don't even necessarily have to be funny in order to be funny. If your sense of humor is as broad as mine, you will love it. If it isn't, you should see it just once and appreciate it if nothing else.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
89,CharltonBoy,Watch this or i will bite your legs off!,9,16 March 2002,"Without a shadow of a doubt Monty Python produced the funniest films ever made.The Holy Grail is the first of the feature movies (not including Now For something Completely Different)and although superbly funny it is not as funny as The Meaning Of Life or the funniest film ever made The Life Of Brian. The Python team set out to find the Holy Grail and along the way they meet sureal characters  ,sing silly songs and come up the silliest and extremely funny dialogue you will ever hear, such as, the french knights who fight by insulting their enemies with taunts such as ""I wave my private parts at your aunties, you cheesy lot of second hand electric donkey bottom biters!"" The problem i have with The Holy Grail is the ending. I Know Python's humour is very , very, sureal at times but without giving the ending away it tries to be python like yet fails letting the audiance down.

Airplane, Tropic Thunder and this one. One of three brilliant Monty Python comedies (Life of Brian and the underrated Meaning of Life being the other two) Holy Grail is simply absurd magical perfection that should not work but simply does.Eminently quotable with bits that are referenced in modern movies forty years later (Ready Player One had the Holy Hand Granade) the only real discussion is what is your favorite part of the movie. (If I had to choose I am partial to Lancelot at the wedding. Kind of Game of Thrones Red Wedding but even funnier,)Simply one of the funniest and most delightful films that is almost safe for the whole family.

91,The_Movie_Cat,"""In God's name, show me the grail!""",4,10 December 2000,"Can I commit heresy by making a small confession? I don't find Monty Python very funny. Neither is Black Adder, and Sgt.Pepper isn't the greatest album ever made.Python is commendable, of course. The sketch show was interesting, and made innovative use of the television format. (I would say groundbreaking but I've seen Spike Milligan's ""Q""). Yet funny? Python has always struck me as the very worst kind of undergraduate humour, the sort of indulgent ""comedy"" that's uncool to dislike in any University.In reality, of course, I suspect the somewhat obvious sight gags and formula juxtapositions are liked by a very small minority. But the ultimate in Emperor's New Clothes causes black t-shirted, Wilde-quoting students to break into peer-pleasing hysterics at a knight who goes ""ni!"" A worry is that if you don't laugh then you'll be called ""thick"" or told that you just ""don't get it"". But I do get it, and it's nowhere near as clever as it pretends to be. The repetitive jokes (Knights on pretend horseback; ironic detachment to death; characters who talk too much), coupled with the attempt at a singular narrative make Holy Grail an exercise in tedium.It doesn't help matters that the six members of the group aren't exactly natural comedians. John Cleese, the supposed comic genius of the team is possibly the least funny. I mean, he's too posh, surely? Posh people aren't funny, that's the rule. Seeing middle-class boy Cleese bullying foreigners and the working classes in the overrated Fawlty Towers inexplicably amuses many. Michael Palin would be a straight man in any other troupe, and is far more suited to travelogues. Terry Gilliam, arguably the most talented and a hugely important director, would be the first to admit he's not that hot as a performer. And Graham Chapman, the tall camp one, must get bored playing the same character all the time. That leaves Eric Idle and co-director Terry Jones as the only members who can genuinely raise a smile.I was amazed to find that this is regarded on the IMDb as the strongest Python film, as I have seen a lot better. Holy Grail is symptomatic of every flaw in the series, with hardly a single joke coming off. Even Gilliam's surrealist animation is lacking here, and the songs are a chore to sit through. The few good gags involve a Trojan rabbit which the knights forget to hide in; Neil Innes singing the uncomplimentary tale of Sir Robin; a copyright disclaimer signed by Richard Nixon, and a Yorkshireman King. However, the only part that made me laugh out loud was the truly hilarious killer rabbit. Five funny jokes. 85 minutes. Oh dear. 4/10.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
92,rzajac,Funny because it's true,10,19 May 2006,"What can I say? I went to see Holy Grail when it first came out, oh so many years ago. And what an amazing thing it is, in so many ways.For one thing, it certainly sets a standard for excellence on a small budget. This should cause much rejoicing among film students.I had a great interaction with my son-in-law on this. He's a next-generation fan of Holy Grail. But when I mentioned the film's insights into morality and human nature, he was a little taken aback. I gave one example; where Sir Robin gives the ""canned"" response to the bridgekeeper's question, ""What's yer favorite colour?"" The joke is funny because it's a clever portrayal of everyday cowardice. And from there, the analogy expands. Cowardice begins with the denial of our own thoughts and feelings, out of fear of confrontation. What we have might be insight, but out of cowardice we hide it under a bushel. We can laugh at Palin's portrayal of this, but there's a whole other level; a powerful, tendentious payload. There exist tragic souls who take this attitude to ungodly extremes; denying what they really feel to the bitter end of self-worth, of relationships, and even of life. And that's the genius of this scene; that Palin is, indeed, dispatched to the Chasm of Eternal Peril (or whatever it's called). It was a small thing, really; a kneejerk reaction to a harmless query about his own color preference. But the end thereof is Death. And don't you forget it!And there are lots and lots of insights like this in Holy Grail. If you think I'm being too analytical, well, all I'm doing really is scraping the surface away in an attempt to explain the fact that many, many people find this to be a timeless classic. I'm just saying, ""And for good reason.""",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
93,Angry_Arguer,Sophomoric Sophistication,10,4 September 2003,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a ""box of chocolates"" where some have jokes have fillings, others are stale, and still others are overkill.  Being as this is a Python movie (in other words, made on peanuts), I can't helped but be amazed as to how the story bears little resemble to anything else yet falls apart at the end.'Holy Grail resembles Clerks in that there is a vague outline of plot, but it is scanted on because the Python crew is more concerned about gags and funny skits than actually storytelling skill.  Some of the moments are rather creative (I liked the Python animation, it has an cruder unconventional appearance compared to nowadays) and others are just stupid...the ending for example.  How could they consider that an ending?!Overall, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is good for a few laughs, but isn't as sophisticated as many would have you believe.

The jokes are incredibly well-conceived and impeccably delivered by this troupe of geniuses. However, I do find this style of comedy can struggle over a full movie and works better as sketches. The story itself is fairly uninteresting and struggles to carry so many self-aware gags. I also really quite despise the cartoon interludes which are completely out of place.

96,TheNorthernMonkee,hilarious masterpiece,10,18 July 2005,"SPOILERS Once upon a time, six amazing friends teamed up together to write one of the finest British comedies of all time. They would collectively be known as 'Monty python' and the series was ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"". Shown from 1969 to 1974, the series featured some of the funniest comedy ever created in this country.One year after the series, the gang were back together to traverse British history and poke fun at one of the greatest legends in the country's history, the legend of King Arthur. Brilliantly clever, this film, ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" was hilarious throughout. From the ridiculous subtitles of the opening credits through to the sudden and abrupt ending, the film is a work of genius. It has aged beautifully and remains as funny on the hundredth time of viewing as when your a Python virgin.England in the dark ages and the country is a mysterious and dangerous place. With the black death rampant and peasants starving, King Arthur (Graham Chapman) and his knights of the Round Table are a beacon to the residents of this country. Sent on a quest by God, they travel across the land in pursuit of the greatest treasure of them all, The Holy Grail.From the first sound of coconuts through to the last French insult, every moment of this film stands as a masterpiece. Whether Chapman, Eric Idle, John Cleese, or any of the other Pythons, or one of the brief cameos by Connie Booth, Carol Cleveland or others, every single person to set foot on screen plays a character of meticulous construction and humour. Characters like the Knights who say Ni, Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-As-Sir-Lancelot and Brother Maynard, everyone is played with comedy timing and hilarity. You literally watch this film over and over and you still find yourself rolling on the floor in laughter at points. It never stops making you laugh and years later your still quoting parts of it.There's not much else which can really be said about ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"". Hilarious from start to finish, it is a sign of everything which is good about British comedy. It is daft, it is weird, and most importantly it is memorable.

It is absolutely hilarious for the first 1/3 of the running time but then it kind of peters out at the end. That it was made on a shoe-string budget is clearly evident but that doesn't necessarily mean that it will be bad. Many of the million-dollar blockbusters made today are not worth 1/10 of their budget.As has been mentioned many, many times, the Pythons are extremely clever and creative writers and that was their forte in their TV show which we all know was a sketch show. When putting sketches on a feature and at the same time have a plot-driven story, one of the elements get compromised. As mentioned, the first 1/3 of the film does work because the Pythons successfully interweave the two elements. Then somehow the comedy goes flat. There are still a few funny bits but not that many.As mentioned on one of the commentaries on the DVD release, we learn that there was some conflict on the location shoot, especially between the actors and Terry Gilliam. Terry Jones took over some of the directorial duties, and sorry to say this, because Gilliam is a brilliant director, Jones has much more flair for comedy. Maybe that was why the film is so bi-polar.The Pythons play almost all the roles, but special mention must be made to Michael Palin and John Cleese who have the most outrageous characters (the knight, the taunter (Cleese) and the repressed peasant (Palin) - notice Palin in the dirt) Graham Chapman plays it straight and you have to admire that too. You could buy him as a legitimate character in one of these films set in medieval times. He was reportedly plagued by problems with alcohol at the time, but it doesn't show on screen.Why do I think this is a bad film? I don't. It has no point and that was the idea but as entertainment it is very uneven.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
112,Horror-yo,English comedy classic,7,18 May 2016,"Surely this film is overrated in that it's been tagged with 'greatness' as one of John Cleese and the gang's most prominent works. It's meta, it's cynical, it's essential, all that crap. Really, it's a funny flick with some very funny moments, others way over the top that are only just bearable if you really try hard to be a good public, but on its own is quite self-indulgent. This is the inside humor of a bunch of guys who love to make sketches, and they make a movie. Hopefully, you're on their side and get the humor either from a cultural pov (you are British/Irish) or you fancy it because it's such an 'essential' comedy that sticks out. Again, lots of funny moments, completely bananas in places, a good comedy I'd recommend, but definitely overrated by the pseudo-intellectual clique.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

117,nickenchuggets,"""Now go away or I shall taunt you a second time""",9,13 July 2021,"I love it when a movie goes to great lengths trying to establish certain rules only to purposefully break them later. Monty Python and the Holy Grail might seem (to an outsider's point of view) like a relatively stable and serious movie due to its focus on King Arthur, but anyone who thinks this clearly has never watched MP before. Praised by many as the best comedy movie ever, what Holy Grail does especially well is combine aspects of humor, violence, and a medieval setting. Of course, it wouldn't be Monty Python without the familiar actors playing the various characters, and the movie gets this right as well. Filmed mostly in Scotland, the story is set in the year 932 AD and has King Arthur (Graham Chapman) traversing Britain and looking for people willing to join his Knights of the Round Table. He and his fellow traveler Patsy face strange, humorous (and sometimes even dangerous) situations along the way, such as a witch trial where a woman is accused of being one after someone says she turned him into a newt. King Arthur also has a showdown with a knight wearing black armor who is tasked with guarding a path Arthur must take to continue on his quest. Even after severing all of his limbs, he thinks victory is his. Shortly after, Arthur gathers some other men who are willing to join him on his journey. In one of the most hilarious and quotable scenes ever put to a motion picture, Arthur and his allies come across a castle solely inhabited by french forces, and after asking them about the whereabouts of the Grail, the french say they've already got one. One of the french occupiers continues to harass and verbally assault Arthur and his men, after which they launch an artillery barrage of farm animals at them. Forced to fall back, Arthur and his men are forced to use a trojan horse (or in this case trojan rabbit) to gain access to the french castle, but none of them climb inside it. The french do end up letting the rabbit proceed inside, only to hurl it back at the english with a catapult. Later, one of Arthur's knights is led astray to a place called Castle Anthrax that is inhabited only by women, which means he is disappointed when the rest of his team is forced to ""rescue"" him. Once Arthur meets a strange new character named Tim the Enchanter, things become more creepy but still manage to be pretty funny. Tim says the Grail is hidden in a cave, but unfortunately, the mouth of the cave is guarded by a deceivingly harmless looking rabbit that effortlessly slaughters a large amount of knights when they go to attack it. After deploying a new weapon called the Holy Hand Grenade against the rabbit, it is killed and the team is free to go inside. A hieroglyph on a wall reveals that the Grail is in a place called Castle Aarrgh. In the last major obstacle of their journey, Arthur and his knights must approach the keeper of the Bridge of Death and answer 3 of his questions correctly if they wish to cross it. One knight answers the three deceptively easy questions, and is allowed to pass, but one fails an easy question and another fails an unexpectedly difficult one. Both are thrown into the gorge below by some mysterious force. Finally, it's Arthur's turn. The bridge keeper asks him what the velocity of an air-laden swallow is, and Arthur asks him if the swallow is African or European. The bridge keeper can't answer his own question, and is thrown into the abyss. Finally, Arthur and what remains of his team see the supposed resting place of the Grail on the horizon, and to their horror, they learn the same french soldiers from earlier are inside it. They get ready to attack the castle, but cops show up and arrest King Arthur for the murder of a present day historian earlier in the film. This is a ridiculous movie. It makes no sense, and most people watching will know it makes no sense. That doesn't mean it's bad, mind you. If anything, Monty Python in general thrives on absurd storytelling and outrageous characters. There's definitely a lot of plain stupid and laughable moments in this movie, such as when Sir Lancelot (John Cleese) tries to rescue a girl from a castle after receiving a letter. He arrives and starts mindlessly killing everybody there with his sword, only to discover the letter he received was from an effeminate prince. Another example are ""the knights who say ni"", a clan of incredibly tall knights who want King Arthur to retrieve a shrubbery for them (one that's not too expensive). I remember seeing a trailer for this movie that is done in the same ridiculous style as the film itself, and the ending shows an ad for chinese food or something, stating that the movie's premiere is just 10 minutes from the restaurant. Even the guys who made it didn't take it very seriously, but it still manages to be one of the best comedy movies ever produced.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
118,CinematicInceptions,"Hilarious for me, but probably not for most.",8,5 August 2014,"I have seen this movie six times in the past 20 months, and it is perhaps my favorite movie, with a rating of 9.6. I'm a fan of the witty, intelligent, British humor, though I know from experience that puts me in a group that very few people fit into. However, I think this movie has a bad rep because of its fans. Being one of them, I know that quoting lines from it all the time can really get on people's nerves. As a result, many people whose local Python fan convinces them to watch the film have already heard each line a hundred times apiece. So lots of people watch this movie with no small degree of prejudice, but there are a few scenes that I feel could be humorous to most people. I've seen non-Python fans enjoy the Tale of Sir Lancelot, the Black Knight scene, the witch burning, and the Holy Hand Grenade. The rest of the jokes and such leave lots of people confused or wondering how it is supposed to be funny. Even with modern ratings, it would retain its PG rating, though it is certainly not a kids movie. There is some crude humor in it, but not like you see in some films. Most of the humor is just puns and ridiculous lines that are somehow even funnier because of the British accent. Even though the producers had a low budget to work with, they definitely got a good bang for their buck. Everything that comes as a result of budget cuts creates some of the elements that the Monty Python group is famous for, like the coconut horses and the blood that resembles Kool-Ade more than anything else. The acting is very good too from the annoyance of Graham Chapman, to the smiles of Eric Idle, and the versatility of John Cleese that is rivaled by few. The performances of Terry Jones, Michael Palin, and Terry Gillman are also impressive. On a slightly religious note, I feel that the scene with God reprimanding Arthur for groveling is a great example of how the Church of today is rather too wordy and falsely flattering in prayers. The only point in this movie that I don't like that much is when Sir Bedevere and King Arthur are traveling from the Bridge of Death to the Castle Arrg. To conclude, I would recommend this movie to anyone in a passing bad mood to let them know that the craziness of the world is not necessarily a bad thing, but if you're looking for a movie to watch for continuous laughs, find something else. To all avid Monty Python fans, I would say, enjoy this movie as much as you want, but quoting it among people that will respond to it negatively is a bad move.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

There's the problem and the Genius of Monty Python-some get it, some don't. It's unconventional, chaotic, hilarious, but there's no point explaining to those who don't get it, as if you don't when you first see it, you never will. So many funny scenes and one liners, my favourites being the white rabbit scene, and the bridge/3 questions scene. And the Black night.

130,theshadow908,The best Monty Python film.,8,19 June 2006,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail tells the story of King Arthur and his knights of the round table as they head out on a quest to find the Holy Grail. This is based on a real Arthurian legend, but made hilariously absurd by the Monty Python group. This is Monty Python's best film because it is non stop funny, and its twist on the legend of King Arthur makes a great base for a film.The reason I find Monty Python funny is because their humour is so random, and so absurd, that you can't help but laugh at how ridiculous and how stupid some of it is. What I like about this film in particular, is that it can't even make it through the opening credits without goofing off with subtitles at the bottom of the screen. Then, as the movie actually starts, it manages to look like a serious King Arthur film for all of five seconds before we notice that King Arthur is not riding a horse, but he's skipping along as a lackey behind him clacks too coconuts together making the sound of hooves. Then, the verbal humour starts. This movie has some truly hilarious characters that will make you fall to the floor laughing. There's Sir Robin, the Not-Quite-As-Brave-As-Sir-Lancelot, who everyone thinks is the bravest of all the knights when in fact, he's afraid of the smallest of things. Then there's the Knights Who Say NI, a group of knights that scare all who see them by screaming the word NI over and over. Possibly the funniest scene in the movie is where the knights of the round table are attacked by the fiercest monster in all the world...A fluffy white bunny.What makes the movie even better is that it was made on a very small budget, so in some scenes, animation has to take over because they just couldn't afford to do the scene in live action, but they manage to cover this up by making the animation scenes absolutely hilarious. The Monty Python group are true comic geniuses, and this is their best work. I recommend this movie to everyone that likes a good laugh.8.5/10",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

The answer would appear like a mirage in front of me and shine like the beacon on the castle Anthrax. It would be this film. And here's why:It is insane. There isn't a tale or a legend that isn't butchered in this mindless mess of a film - the poor b*****ds seeking the grail get to experience some pretty weird adventures on their quest.It is impossible to tell which scene is the funniest, as there is actually only one that goes on for just a tad too long (the one with the peasants gathering filth and explaining to king Arthur the fundamentals of anarchy), but even that scene is funny in some instances (""You can't become king just because some watery tart throws a sword at you!"").

133,nobbytatoes,on second thought lets not watch the holy grail....tis a silly movie,10,11 December 2005,"King Arthur is going across Britian to find knights to join his Knights of the Round Table. Soon Arthur and his Knights are told by God to search for the Holy Grail. Along the way they meet some strange and interesting people and creatures, and get into all sorts of problems.Monthy Python and the Holy Grail is a comedy classic. The guys from Monty Pythons are comic genesis, creating an all out, non stop laughing movie. All the characters in the Holy Grail are absolute classic, also the scenes their in. The Black Knight and his dismembering appendages, never giving up a fight despite any wound he incurs. The Frnech Guard taunting Arthur and his Knight; with a outrageous accent, saying they already have a Grail, to which Arthur and his Knights make a trogan horse; forgetting the all important point of being inside the horse. Sir Galahad stumbling upon the Castle Anthrax; full of sex deprived women. Sir Lancelot and his blood soaked rampage to save a trapped prince. The Knight who say Ni, Tim the Enchantor, the killer rabbit and so many more.The animation by Terry Gilliam that is spliced into the film works to great effect; giving it extra Monty Phython feel, the animation has that Gilliam aesthetic of surrealism. The acting is just wonderful. Yes that it is over acted, but it suits it perfectly. Its great how they played most of the characters themselves, showing a range of personalities and acting abilities. The film is basically a line of skits, but they have connected them really well and made them run at a constant flow, always keeping the laughs coming. Some of the running jokes through the film don't lose any punch or humor, which many running jokes in other films fall flat by the end.

Fortunately, the he-freaking-larious is the one that turns up most frequently-- especially during the perfectly Monty-Python-like ending (get that camera out of here!). Sadly, British comedy will never be the same without the complete cast of Pythons.

138,TheHonestCritic,"Is the nonsense showcased in this ""film"" genius? Or, is it a complete waste of cinema? Check out my review below!",2,25 May 2021,"""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" (1975), oh my God. That's pretty much all I have to say to start out my review of this train wreck. This is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the top ten worst comedy films I have ever seen and I'm not kidding. This ""movie"" is based off the British TV series, ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"". I have seen some clips of that show, and it surprisingly does have a few decent moments here and there. However, as a whole, it doesn't do that much for me. Keep in mind, I haven't seen every episode. But, if what I've seen already is any indication, it's just your average run of the mill comedy show. Well, I guess someone must've saw dollar signs in front of their eyes and said: ""hey, let's make a film out of this show!"" Now, making a movie based off a TV show is a difficult, but not impossible feat. That being said, I don't know how they took a TV series with very little to no substance and made it into a 90 minute ""movie"". Actually, I'm still not convinced that they did. Because, this ""film"" sucks! ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" has a messy and mangled story, the acting is all over the place, most of the special effects are dated, and even the soundtrack is boring! The premise of the storyline is based on the Arthurian Legend. However, the goal was to make it as historically inaccurate as possible. Yes, I do get that was supposed to be the recurring joke, but it wasn't funny. Not in the slightest! Granted, I have seen some episodes of TV shows where they make fun of old historical events. Some of them were funny, and some were not. A concept like this works better in small doses, otherwise it just winds up being completely lethargic. They were on the right track with keeping it shorter than two hours since it was supposed to be a comedy, but those 90 minutes just dragged on forever. Honestly, for the majority of the runtime, next to nothing of substance happens. Listen, I'm all for parodies and other media that make fun of events in history. But, you have to be an expert when it comes to writing a screenplay like that! Literally, within the first few minutes, I knew exactly what kind of ""movie"" I was in for, and it was all downhill from there. Aside from the boring and uninspired opening credits (which I believe were extended on purpose to pad out the runtime), the characters were just pretending to ride horses. I just slapped myself in the forehead with anger. If that had happened only once with the horse riding joke, then it would've been more on the right track. However, they showcase that unnecessary trite every chance they get and it stops being funny. Another big issue with the plot, or lack thereof, is the overabundance of predictable humor. Now, I do enjoy predictable humor done right. One of the best, if not the best examples of a film with predictable comedy, is ""Airplane!"" (1980). For that type of humor to work, the audience has to expect what's about to happen. But, the inevitable joke has to happen unexpectedly and that's what will trigger the laugh. In ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", you can see every joke from a mile away and know what's about to occur before it happens. When you know what's going to happen, then it's not funny. Another thing is the infamous ending of the ""film"". Out of nowhere, the ""movie"" just stops, for no rhyme or reason. It's almost like the film makers thought: ""all right, we've tortured you long enough, you can go now."" This is one of the most poorly conceived and written movies that I've ever seen. Next to nothing happens and then it ends. Nothing has occurred, there was no conflict and nothing was resolved. Film Making 101: when you write a script, or screenplay, you have to end the stories you're trying to tell. That's the basics of writing! A story has to have a beginning and an end. ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" has no opening and no ending. Did none of these writers learn basic storytelling? Now, I'm aware that there are other Monty Python films. But, this is the first, and probably the only one I will ever see. Maybe the other movies are better? I doubt that very greatly! As for the acting, it's just as big a letdown as the story. The sad thing is, most of these actors and actresses are great in other roles! What's their excuse here? How could they have agreed to make this ""film""? They must've been bribed, or they had no other choice. This ""movie"" has some of the most cringe-worthy and unfunniest performances I've seen in any comedy. As for the special effects, a lot of them were well-done. But, some of them have not aged well at all. Seriously, at certain points they use cartoon animation along with the live actors! The only movies where that idea works are: ""Mary Poppins"" (1964), ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?"" (1988) and ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action"" (2003). So far, those are the only three films to get that concept 100% right. The soundtrack is nothing short of a generic and cliched mess. Granted, there were some tidbits where it sounded like the film score was trying, but overall, it just drags the ""movie"" down even further, if that's even possible! The only good element in this ""film"" are the sets/locations. They do create a somewhat decent atmosphere. Unfortunately, that's not nearly enough to save this ""movie"" at all. ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is an insult to comedy films and TV shows. It's one of the top ten worst comedy movies I've ever seen and for good reasons. The fact that it gets so much praise just blows my mind! How is that possible?! Like I've said many times before, accolades and box office records mean nothing. If I think a movie is crap, then it's crap, plain and simple. I'm giving this ""film"" only 1 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 2 out of 10 IMDB stars. Now, I know what a lot of you are thinking. ""Oh, this film was made before your time and you may not get the humor and comedy involved."" First of all, I know exactly what's going on. Second, I don't ever judge movies based on when they were made. I watch and critique them for what they are, as standalone films. Now, granted, most older movies defecate on modern day films! But sometimes, there is a dud here and there. No matter what year, or decade, there will always be both good and bad. That being said, calling ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" a dud is an understatement. Bottom line, do I really have to tell you to stay away from this waste of film making? You'll just be wasting your time. Even the Lord himself would be ashamed of it!",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

It is truly a very entertaining experience, the sheer amount of jokes delivered in this film in pretty much unmatched, I would say. Essentially, this consists of a barrage of very intelligent jokes, trowed one after another. Monty Python's later film, Life of Brian, can be considered superior as a film, but in terms of raw entertainment value, I would rank this as their best.Highly recommended comedy, one of the best there is, in fact. I should also note that I am very rigorous on my rating system: 8/10 is a very strong score in my book. Here's my scoring system:10 - Masterpiece 9 - Superb 8 - Excellent 7 - Very good 6 - Good 5 - MediocreSo, this film is excellent, but it doesn't achieve true greatness, unlike their later film, Life of Brian.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
142,luke-a-mcgowan,Everything about this movie works,10,26 March 2016,"1. There's nothing I can say about The Holy Grail that hasn't been said. This isn't a movie to analyse, it's a movie to just sit and soak up how wonderfully funny it is. Every moment spent figuring out why it is funny is a moment you could spend quoting the lines or just clutching your stomach as your gasp for air through your laughter.2. A low budget is what makes this movie. Half the best jokes (intentionally or not) come from the fact that the film's budget was low - coconuts for horses, poor visual effects, the rabbit, the animator having a fatal heart attack - its all good!3. The screenplay knows just how to drop in the most incredibly unexpected characters. Dennis the politically astute peasant, the soldiers who get bogged down discussing logistics of swallow airspeed velocity, the extremely forward women of Castle Anthrax and the effeminate Prince Herbert are just some of the hilarious characters who you would never expect to show up in a movie in this genre. 4. The addition of the Holy Hand Grenade goes to show that it isn't just characters that bemuse and amuse.5. The amount of effort put into the film is still incredible. How many rewrites would they need for the Knights Who Say Ni scene to ensure the word ""it"" wasn't used? The ""he's not allowed to enter the room"" skit in Swamp Castle is something you'd expect from Abbott and Costello.6. The insults are amongst the best ever written. Anything said by the French Knight (played by John Cleese) is enough to have you crying with laughter.7. Come to think of it, anything Cleese does is hilarious. Whether he's Lancelot, so brave that he attacks a castle with his sword; the French Knight who gets a sick pleasure taunting Arthur; a famous Enchanter whose name Cleese forgot and so just ad-libbed ""Tim""; a peasant who was turned into a newt and got better or the Black Knight who is so deranged in his single-minded guarding of a random bridge that he allows Arthur to chop him to pieces before he gives up, he will provide the best lines in the film.8. Don't want to sell the rest of the cast short. Graham Chapman's angry frustration at people who don't act the way they should in a fantasy-epic is always hilarious. Terry Jones' high- pitched Bedivere and Michael Palin's Galahad are funny caricatures that are hilarious in their total lack of resemblance to the historical characters. Terry Gilliam is amusing as Patsy and the Old Man from Scene 24, among others. Eric Idle comes close to stealing the show, especially in the guise of Sir Robin, the Not Quite So Brave as Sir Lancelot. 9. Terry Gilliam's animations often add a lot of amusement to the film, especially his rendition of God and the Monster of Aaaaarghhhhh. Some of the cutaways are so funny in their own right you don't even care that it just cutaway from the adventures of Arthur and his knights.10. The subplot of the murdered historian is strange, but given how the film ends I couldn't imagine any other way to end it. It just comes off as so appropriate for this low-budget, meta spoof of Arthurian legend.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

144,williampsamuel,The Holy Grail of Comedy,10,7 January 2015,"More than one person has confessed to me that they just don't 'get' Monty Python. Some of them have asked what it is they're overlooking, what the point is. I tell them that they aren't overlooking anything. The whole point of Monty Python is that there is no point. It's nonsensical, over-the-top, and you either get it or you don't. Or you do and you're highly offended. I confess that I don't get all of their routines, Confuse-A-Cat for example, but I find most of their material hilarious. And no-where are they funnier than in Holy Grail.Even if you've never seen the movie, or don't have any idea who or what Monty Python is, you already know parts of this movie. Things like the killer bunny, the knights who say Ni, and the Black Knight ""Tis only a flesh wound!"" have become part of popular culture. Who in the English speaking world hasn't heard of the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch? Many people may not know where it came from, but they've heard of it. Same for the infamous cries of ""Bring out your dead!""Practically all of the film's uproarious routines are widely known, and can be recited word for word by legions of fans. Every scene is just plain funny, and how could they not be, considering the people involved. John Cleese, Erik Idle, and the rest are simply master comedians. Their timing and delivery are perfect, and more importantly, they have some of the most brilliant, deranged imaginations anywhere. These guys come up with ideas unlike any that have been thought of before, like a three headed giant who argues with himself about tea and scones, or an order of knights dedicated to shrubberies and the saying of a fictional curse, or a giant cartoon beast that nearly kills the heroes before the animator suffers a fatal heart attack. Or they use deliberate anachronisms, like medieval peasants spouting socialist dogma, or King Arthur killing a noted historian who was recapping the last scene. Yeah, Monty Python breaks the fourth wall fairly often.And they also come up with totally new ways of looking at a well known subject. Take the princess trapped in the castle, who must be rescued by a brave knight. Here they turn the situation on its head by substituting a whiny prince for the beautiful princess, and manage to skewer both sappy song-and-dance numbers and mindless violence while they're at it. Witch hunts are another familiar subject. We've all seen plenty of witch burnings in the movies, but this is the first time that the accused witch is tried using the latest ""scientific methods."" The logic displayed here is ""more tortured than Pavarotti at a Tiny Tim concert"" as Scott Adams would say, and it's absolutely side splitting.Holy Grail was the epitome of randomness long before the term had been coined. It is a total farce, in which even the opening credits and the intermission are a joke. It's silly, it's inane, it's insane, it has plot holes you could drive a truck through, and it's one of my favorite comedies.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

A few times I've come across this film but never knowing what it is. It is only when Flickchart recorded this movie in their top 20 global list that I simply decided to check it out. And, I can say, I'm glad to have checked out such a classical movie What I liked most about this movie is its awareness to its absurdity, which simply doesn't stop from start to finish. What may seem like a boring adventure movie turns out to be a classical medieval mockery done in the most brilliant way.The jokes made in this movie are surprisingly funny and do not get carried away. In fact, they also don't slow down the movie much. This entire movie is simply one little story filled with many, many obstacles. The good thing is, for this type of movie, the story is put to a very low standard focusing on more adventure moments in this film as King Arthur and a group of knights are called down by the Almighty to get the Holy Grail.There are so many funny moments in the movie such as when King Arthur and an army, at the end, charge towards the castle only for cars to come and stop them! The funny thing is, back then, there were no cars! Its just plain stupid all the way, which is great. Also, Arthur continuously moving like he is mounted on a horse is priceless as is the Bridge of Death question scene.This movie is a great movie to me, thoroughly enjoying the movie, though it certainly feels out of place to see this movie on Flickchart's Top 20. A great movie, a classic, fun adventure filled with many goofs that is sure to make you laugh",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

148,antagonist117,"The Pythons', and particularly Gilliam's, successful jump from short-form to long-form comedy",10,2 September 2013,"Before Holy Grail, the Pythons had not shown that long-form comedy was within their range. The longest sketches on their Flying Circus TV show, like ""Scott of the Antarctic"" or ""The Piranha Brothers,"" ran at most ten or fifteen minutes. Terry Gilliam, unquestionably the sixth of the six main cast members, had filled some of the more outlandish bit parts in the show but was best known for creating its often-perverse animated sequences. Holy Grail changed all of that. The troupe's stock-in-trade, satirical setups that devolve almost instantly into absurdity, proved so adaptable to the feature-length format that Holy Grail became arguably their most widely-recognized and beloved work. Most of the individual vignettes, like the Black Knight and the witch- weighing scene, derive from the medieval setting, but the cadence of the delivery and the flair for wordplay are distinctly Pythonian. The film was also the springboard for Terry Gilliam's surprisingly-successful directorial career, and is a good example of his ability to create an off-kilter, vaguely-creepy atmosphere.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
149,fjhuerta-2,A film that will stand the test of time.,9,19 January 2001,"Warning: Mild spoilers ahead.Monty Python and the Holy Grail is the finest example of what you can do when resources are low, impetus are high, and the world's finest comedy troupe assembles to have some fun. The film was made as if a group of old friends were to come together and simply have some fun behind a camera. So spontaneus. But then, the magic of verbal exchanges as inspired as the African/European Swallow demonstrate once and for all that its not only vulgarity that can make you laugh... inspired pseudo-intellectual exchanges will, too. And that's Monty Python. The witch hunt (where it is scientifically demonstrated that you can distinguish a witch from a human) is an extreme example of intellectual stupidity. It's so much fun watching a group of educated, intelligent and astute people having a go at each other.It's not all intellectual stuff, though. The Killer Rabbit scene is very, very similar to the dog fight in ""Something about Mary"", but without sexual innuendo or having to resort to obscenity. It's simply a stuffed rabbit being tossed around, killing the brave knights. Arguably, the best, silliest part of the film. Or what about the initial credits, filled with mooses? Or the Knights who say Ni? Or Castle Anthrax? or...This film is simply amazing. I have watched it more than 20 times in less than 3 years, and intend to keep on doing it.

The film will likely go down in history as having the longest legs of any absurdist comedy, with many quotes and jokes being told now 30+ years later from folks who may not even know they are quoting it (I am guilty of this).

Absolutely mid blowing experience of stupidity and unconventional way of making movie makes you forget it's every flaw and just sucks you in the unique experience of the movie. If you take half of the comedies and combine them together you are still not even close to silliness of the movie and it's originality.

156,Sonatine97,"Help Help, I'm being Oppressed!",9,5 July 2000,"A marvellous film that will have anyone with a slightly silly disposition fall in love with. Its typical Python from the the TV series, with rapid irreverent clips interlacing the rather scatty story of Arthur looking for the Holy Grail.Of course a lot of criticism was directed at the apparently limp & sudden ending, with perhaps audiences expecting a punchline to appear shortly after but was never forthcoming. Its true that the ending was a little confusing but its typical Python, coupled with a dwindling budget and a lack of ideas as to how to really end the film.Holy Grail looks pail compared to the latter Life of Brian movie which enjoyed a larger budget from a bigger studio. But Grail had the virginal charm that perhaps wasn't very apparent with Brian; everything seemed very adhoc, adlibbed & incidental which gave the movie a sparkling & refreshing charm about it.There are many scenes where the attempt at humour falls on deaf ears, but this is to be expected. It would be rare indeed to find a movie that retained its humour throughout. But a large proportion of the jokes do succeed, big time. Especially the Bring Out Your Dead scene and the Black Knight at the bridge - sick, but excellent.John Cleese has always been my favourite Python actor and I kept on half expecting him to reprise his dead Parrot sketch somehow.My favourite Python film of all - it had charm. wit, exuberance, energy and plenty of good laughs to boot!***/*****",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

Aw man what a great way to start fantasy month with this medieval dark comedy. I don't know much about the Python group but Terry Gilliam the director I've heard about from two other films of his I wish to see like Time Bandits and The Brothers Grimm. King Arthur, accompanied by his squire, recruits his Knights of the Round Table, including Sir Bedevere the Wise, Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-As-Sir-Lancelot and Sir Galahad the Pure. They receive a message from God to go on a quest for the Holy Grail. Throughout their quest more silliness ensues. The beginning of the film when King Arthur is looking for knights to recruit is maybe my favorite part of the film. But as they are then given their quest I find myself laughing more and more. It's a relevant comedy with lines like ""Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. If I went around saying I was an emperor, just because some moistened bint lobbed a scimitar at me, they'd put me away!"" The taunting French guard was also super hilarious. The directors are great I had only heard of one which I mentioned earlier was Terry Gilliam. Terry Jones, he did two of Python Movies Life of Brian and Meaning of Life.

159,robsta23,Hands Down One of the Funniest Movies Ever,9,25 February 2016,"When it comes to comedies, they tend to be hit-or-miss movies. The sense of humor that goes into comedies reaches some audiences while others find it distasteful. That being said, it can be safely said that Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a comedy for virtually everyone. It is even a good experience for children since there is really only one suggestive scene and it is very brief.Nearly every scene in this film is comic gold and very quotable. Who can forget the black night remarking ""'tis but a flesh wound,"" the holy hand grenade, or even the opening scene (are you suggesting coconuts migrate)? Even great historical allusions are made for humor, such as a reference to the idea of the Trojan horse.The film also has a great sense of self-awareness and is very meta. The narrator comments on the animator at one point, a woman dressed in white refers to the script of the film, and the characters refer to specific scenes from earlier in the film. This is all in good fun and its self-awareness is primarily meant to add to the humor rather than commenting on art in general which more ""serious"" meta texts tend to do.However, this is a strange film when you take into account that from time to time in the film historians appear to briefly comment on the time period and are disregarded the next second as well as other people that are clearly not from the medieval time period becoming involved in the film. This aspect causes the film to end very strangely and abruptly. Monty Python and the Holy Grail would be stronger if it had a more definitive conclusion than the one it does.Filled with comedic gold, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a very enjoyable experience.3.5/4.0",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

163,ryan_kuhn,And Now For Something Completely Different...,9,13 February 2005,"King Arthur never did find that Holy Grail, but from the looks of Monty Python's movie about the search, he did meet a lot of interesting people on his quest. The loony comedy troupe that made the popular BBC television show ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" which featured silly sketches that often didn't end, the famous animation style that looks more like South Park than The Simpsons, and humor that drew as much from 1960s British current events as it did from the Middle Ages. Monty Python was Dennis Miller before Dennis Miller was out of his diapers. All of these influences on their humor come through in their most complete movie, a retelling of the King Arthur legends and lore. And when I say retelling, I mean a series of sketches that have their root in Middle Ages lore and have some affiliation with King Arthur. Methinks the Knights Who Say Ni did not exist in the late 900s. Graham Chapman plays King Arthur, who does not ride a horse, but rather simulates a horse by banging two coconuts together, as he tours the English countryside, trying to find knights for his round table at Camelot. The knights never do make it to Camelot, as Arthur claims ""it is a rather silly place,"" instead are met by God and told of their quest. The movie then follows each knight as they meet snooty Frenchmen (notably John Cleese and his flying barnyard animals), the Castle Anthrax and the 18-22 year old women who make scandalous underwear, the three-headed knight, and many other odd creatures. My favorite tale is that of Sir Lancelot (again, Cleese) as he tries to save someone from being forced to be married by their father. After taking out the entire wedding party, Lancelot finds Prince Herbert (Terry Jones) and silliness ensues. In true Monty Python fashion, the last scene of the movie does not really fit in with the rest of the movie, but if you know Python, you know it is the right ending of the movie. Fantastic points about society are sprinkled in throughout the movie, jokes about overacting are accentuated by the phrase ""Get on with it!"" as shouted by other characters in the movie, and we even get to learn some Swedish. Directed by Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam, it is a fast paced onslaught of scatological jokes, and shrubbery.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
164,patrick_dunne,A fun and silly comedy,8,20 October 2005,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of the most loved and famous comedy titles of all time. It is very funny with a pretty strange sense of humor. One of the earliest jokes in the movie was in the beginning credits with the moose in the captions. That was pretty funny. Then they said that llamas made the movie, which also made me laugh. Then in the beginning of the movie when a man and King Authur are talking about sparrows and coconuts, the man says ""Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?"", which cracked me up. Then in the scene with the dead people, one of the conversations was: Man 1: How do you know he's a king? Man 2: Because he hasn't got s*** all over him. (Keep in mind, these were poor villagers talking.)That was also hilarious. There were many, many more strange and funny moments in this movie. Some were the Black Knight, The cartoon monster, the taunting French men, and many many more.However, many jokes were flawed. Some jokes weren't clever, but just very silly. Others had a very long build-up for a joke that wasn't even very funny to begin with. Then, they repeat some jokes. For example, the ""No he's not dead yet, Oh no! He died!"" joke, was heard three times.Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a funny movie, but those with a different sense of humor may enjoy it more.8/10",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

The comedy at times (a lot) is forced and the delivery is poor. I hate the knights who say NI. That was funny for about three seconds. However when our hero Arthur deals with the Black Knight, things get funny. The scene alone is a hoot with the best lines in the movie. The Black Knight's reactions are priceless. The scene with Sir Robin was okay although came off as a mildy amusing scene. The ending on the other hand is horrid. I could not believe how bad the ending was. Even my brother who liked this agreed that the ending sucked. Of all the ways this could have ended, this was the worst way. The Last Word: At the risk of being unpopular, I won't let that sway my review. This was merely a lame movie. A lot of this was stupid. There are some funny scenes here, not much but some.

At first I was only going to give this movie a 9, but I i cannot think of a single reason not to give it a 10. It is so absurd and does everything perfectly. These are some seriously funny people that work so well together. This movie must have been a blast to make and it shows when you watch it. I liked a lot of the little touches that made the movie just a little bit more ridiculous. The one guy using a club to try to club fish at one point is just really well placed and one has to think ""who thought of putting that there"".

It's a parody film that has fun with every single scene it consists of. It takes full advantage of the tiniest bit of a comedy opportunity in a scene. It created a legacy of Monty Python for years to come.The casting is absolutely grand. Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, Michael Palin, etc. Everyone has their own charm to their performances, and are all very memorable.The film mixes its dialog from med evil times to some modern dialog in terms of language, slang at times, which is small but really effective. It shows that the film doesn't hold back or has boundaries. It's chock full of parody from an array of topics.The scenery is beautiful, some scenes are cheesy for the sake of being cheesy, but effects, landscapes, and other areas are simply great looking. The film takes advantage of every little bit of the environment.This film has endless amounts of famous quotes and scenes, which is why I think it's the best comedy of all time.

177,lucasversantvoort,Comedy gold from start to finish,9,6 May 2015,"This isn't going to be a critical review so much as the next in a long line of raving recommendations. It's one of those cases where you're basically struggling to think of something 'new' to say. But yeahthis is one of those comedies that pretty much everyone loves. Even people who've never really delved into the rest of Monty Python's output still love this film.So, the story—if it even needs recapping—is about the search for the holy grail. Arthur rides the land in search of knights to join him in Camelot. Once he's gathered them, they ride to Camelot, but suddenly decide the place is too silly for them. They receive a message from God: to find the holy grail. They do so and silliness ensues.That's all you need to know plot-wise. As we all know, the film's basically one long series of sketches. Some make fun of medieval history, like the witch trial scene or the scene with the politically knowledgeable peasants, while others are more standalone jokes like the giant whose three heads are constantly bickering about trivial stuff like brushing teeth and what to eat during teatime. While there are only a few scenes that feel dated, almost every sketch is a highlight: the giant, the mocking minstrel, God talking to Arthur and the knights, the coconuts, the swallows, Tim the enchanter, the killer rabbit, the princess who'd ratherjustsiiing; and that's just off the top of my head! Something that's always intrigued me about The Holy Grail is the production design. Obviously, the budget was rather small (roughly a quarter of a million dollars), but surprisingly it doesn't hinder the film's atmosphere. Even though the film pokes fun at its own crappy budget, you still feel like you're wandering in medieval times.But yeahthere's really nothing else to say but Watch. This. Film. It's one of the greatest comedies ever made. To use that terrible phrase: there's something in it for everyone. Oh, and whoever thinks the ending is an uninspired cop-out can sod off.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

I've met people who think they are stupid, but I've never met anyone who has hated them. They are simply some of the greatest and funniest spoofs ever put onto film. The British style of comedy is different from America's, but it is so unique that Americans have quickly fallen in love with it, and Monty Python is part of the reason for it.The humor is kind of different, but it is irresistibly funny. This is one of those movies that you can just kick back and enjoy all of the unique qualities of. This is in fact the best Monty Python film ever made. There is a funny line that is referenced to in almost any movie you can think of. I strongly recommend this, even if you don't like British humor, you'll probably like the very unique qualities and side splitting humor that this movie has.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

It is as dry as the Sahara desert. I watched this together with my girlfriend and she left after a good 20 minutes. I had a good time and many jokes still make me laugh. But in al honesty, as a 90 minutes film it was a bit too long. I think this kind of humor works better within shorter sketches or 30 minutes episodes. The story doesn't make any sense (isn't intent to be) and that gets a bit annoying after some time. Could be me though...comedy is not my go-to genre and I prefer humor to be less on the nose in films.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

This movie is a hilarious comedy masterpiece and I definitely recommend a watch/",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
181,datautisticgamer-74853,Booming hilarity even after 43 years,9,14 July 2018,"As I started my camp in Vermont, one of our counselors decided to put this movie on. I was surprised at how few people went with us to view it, as I was very curious. My family loves the Flying Circus, and for several years they have wanted me to view some of their skits. Now, what is it about this movie that makes it hold up?For characters, we have twists on Arthur's Knights of the Round Table that stem from 932 social attitudes applied to 1975. Arthur himself is a tad vain in terms of desiring the Holy Grail, all under the guise of serving God Himself. As expected in group comedies, his Knights come with specific kinks that add to, with the exception of Bevedere, the scenes focusing on them specifically. The way the characters' personalities clash, such as the Frenchman and the 3-headed giant, add more to the comedy. The actors seem to know exactly when they're following the down-to-earth style of the marches or the over-the-top style of their skits. There are several facial expressions that add to the silliness, but I feel that the choreography will be more likely in delivering laughs. The environments feel realistic for 932 outside of the 1975 policemen, although I was rather confused about how Aramaic found its way to England that early. What really makes this film stand out as funny, however, is its incredibly witty writing. Granted, British comedy in the 70s would be rather difficult for 2018 Americans to fully comprehend, but the wide array of sight gags, action, strange quotes, and behaviors are sure to at least once cause an uproar. It's occasionally complex and surreal, but this isn't really a film for children anyway. As such, it may not end up being an issue.Older families will be highly entertained by this film, while young children may be surprised by the nudity, innuendo, occasional language, and violence. It's a classic case of something that the Parental Guidelines would rate PG-DLSV; in other words, know your children before watching this with them. If they are fine with these things, then it may end up being one of the greatest live-action comedies for families. That is more than enough for me to recommend this film.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
182,DrTuvok,A Mixed Bag of Geeky Splendors,7,11 May 2020,"There is no plot, it basically functions as a low-budget spoof of Le Morte D'Arthur.

The bridge scene is clever and hilarious.
The Camelot song is stupid but it will make you laugh and it is funny to watch.
The killer rabbit scene is so ridiculous it can't help but be funny.
The encounter with the cartoon monster is a good 4th wall break.
The witch trial is pretty funny.
The insulting French knight is an accurate spoof of French knights.
The Knights who say 'Ni' are funny out of sheer stupidity.Worst gags:There were some scenes that went on that just weren't funny at all.

183,joshuafagan-64214,The Funniest Movie Ever Made,10,28 October 2015,"To be clear, this is not the best Monty Python movie when viewed from an artistic standpoint. It is a bit uneven and its paper-cap budget shows through like a fire in snow. In fact, it is likely the least artistic movie on this list, give or take something like a Ferris Bueller. But it is the single funniest thing the troupe ever produced. Every joke's on point. They are not afraid to go crazy or surreal and it works, contributing to one of the more interesting, mind-bending atmosphere one can see. Many times, you get the feeling that you are not watching a movie, but rather actors playing parts. But unlike in so many subpar films produced before and after it, this is not a bad thing. If anything, it contributes to the surreal feel.By the way, if you want to see the best Python movie from an artistic standpoint, go watch Life of Brian. While not quite as funny as HG, it too has a slew of quotable lines. But they serve as just tremendously entertaining scenery to a piercing satire that focuses on religion but is not afraid to tread out of that zone and go anywhere it feels. Go watch it if you haven't already.Actually, 'tread out of that zone and go anywhere it feels' is a pretty good descriptor of the Python troupe as a whole. Other than the fact that they at very least popularized a new sort of comedy to the masses, the contributed to my favorite two decades in comedy, the 70s and 80s. For those twenty years, it felt like comedy was not afraid to be wild and crazy, to take over dramatic moments when it pleased, to stride across the field like it was a king. I think that most of the funniest movies I have ever seen come from these two decades, including this one, which I believe to be the funniest movie ever made, though that of course, is subjective.What is not subjective is how this movie has transcended pop culture then and now. Made on basically a nothing budget, this film made gobs of money at the box office, grabbing the heart of the nation and never really letting go. I don't know too many older movies that continue to be watched to this day. And it certainly is a pleasant watch, even to the average film-goer; everything has aged surprisingly well. It helps that the Python gang was always one to start trends rather than emulate them.All of the troupe is fantastic in this film. Every line is deliciously delivered. Many people have tried to copy the Python's brand of comedy, but none of them have succeeded in a deep and meaningful way. And a big reason for that is simply that they aren't the performers that these mad, mad fantastic men were. The late Graham Chapman, playing King Arthur, manages to trump them all, though. On its own right, the performance is clever and interesting in its grand, intentional hollowness. But if you have watched the (excellent) performance given by Richard Harris in the (fine but decidedly not -excellent) move adaptation of the play, Camelot, you are not alone. Chapman obviously watched the movie and based at least some element of his performance off Harris'. Knowing this doubles its comedy value. At least for me.This is one of those films where saying that it looks cheap is not an insult. It was made for nothing and it shows. In fact, the only reason we got the ending that we did is because the troupe ran out of money while making the film and had to adapt. Now, if they had expected us to buy this movie as a straight-ahead adventure story, or even an adventure with a lot of comedic elements, then it would have failed entirely. But they don't. This is a full on screw-ball comedy that knows how weird and bizarre and surreal it is and uses such to its advantage. And the cheapness can actually help with that.Take the famous coconut-horses. The Python crew did not have nearly enough movie to rent real horses for the duration of shooting. So they came up with the idea to use coconut husks to create what faintly sounded like clopping. Do horses sound exactly like that or even remotely close? Not really. But because the coconut-horses became so ingrained into the minds of society, most any time real horses are shown in film, they have to make sure to include a louder, more coconut-husky sound in order to fit people's mental descriptions of what horses should sound like. Now that's staying power.If you haven't watched this movie, do so. You may not enjoy it. It is not to everyone's taste. But if you love this movie, you will really love it. If you tell me to pick out my favorite comedy movie of all time, I will not hesitate before picking this one. You owe it to yourself to see this film.I don't know what quote with which to end this review. So, once more, just see the film for yourself. It's a ride. Every expense is spared, but no joke is. Goodbye.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

It's always good to casually watch a good old Mockumentary and this film has many memorable one liners and scenes that certainly left me satisfied. The narrative is a mess, mean that in a good way, but it's meant to be that way and the film has become a classic for a reason. The Pythons are a brilliant group and I will enjoy watching there many other films.

190,Manthorpe,They could grab it by the husk.....,10,16 February 2004,"King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table set out on a quest to find the Holy Grail...as told to do so by a cartoon God that lives in the clouds... Easily the most hilarious and original comedy ever made, Monty Python and the Holy Grail claims it's undisputed throne through insanely ridiculous situations and characters that will very likely never be duplicated. Pure comedic genius that doesn't go stale with age or decades of competition having been released. Simply seeing the way comedy films are made today, this film will very likely have a long reign before anything can even hold a candle to it. An absolute belly-laugh fest that never lets up.Only the cast of Monty Python could have pulled this film off, with each actor playing many different characters...all hilarious! The genius in the actors' lines themselves are truly to be admired. The comedic style of talking in circles is one technique that most comedies do not try to do, simply because they can't compete with the genius of this film, which uses it flawlessly. Those that do try usually fall flat on their faces. Two particularly excellent examples of this can be seen in the beginning scene, in which the characters discuss the origins of coconuts.....and the other when Lancelot breaks into the swamp castle to save the ""damsel in distress."" This is merely one technique that the cast has perfected to conjure up laughs consistently throughout the entire film. The only way that I can imagine that someone might not like this film is if they simply do not enjoy it's type of humor. Too bad for them.Another hilarious technique used in the film is the use of comedy in the background. From people slamming cats against poles for no apparent reason, to people filling up baskets with mud in the fields....all very strange and hilarious at the same time. It's also simply amazing that all of the characters are played by the same group of actors, which shows the great range all of them have. Some are simply unrecognizable from one character to the other and it sometimes takes a good eye to pick them out, which makes it fun. And I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but this film takes some turns that no sane person could see coming.Ridiculous characters in ridiculous situations equals ridiculous laughter.The epitome of all-star comedy that will no doubt continue to stand the test of time.

The zany humor of the troupe's comedy series carries over well to their first feature film, and their best in my opinion. Once you've seen it, don't be surprised if you catch yourself quoting lines from the movie. Fans of irreverent comedy should love it, but the ending is a bit of a let down.

The film is absolutely hilarious from its ridiculous music numbers to its abstract animations. Scenes like the Knights who Say Ni and Tis but a scratch have become comedy legend. I very much see Monty Python and the Holy Grail as the movie continuation of Flying Circus. Rather than being a film in its own right, it is more a collection of stand-alone sketches and vignettes.

I didn't find the movie hilarious as many people describe it, but I did find it enjoyable and laughed here and there because the movie has so much charm.

195,varundelpiero,Comedic gold...,8,17 February 2009,"It is difficult to comment on/review a comedy flick without being almost exclusively subjective; such is the nature of comedy. Some people just don't 'get' certain comedy acts. In terms of a classic comedy-fest such as MONTY PYTHON, I find it hard to believe that people still don't get comedies that are as irreverent and intelligent as MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL. Even almost 35 years after its release, the jokes remain fresh, and while they won't bring about the same spurts of laughter they do on first viewing, the viewer will undoubtedly chuckle at various instances, out of sheer admiration.The concept of such funny and gifted comedians such as John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, and Michael Palin (all playing multiple roles) spoofing British history/legend is simply hilarious, and their thick British accent just add to the humour.There are numerous sketches in MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL that will live long in the memory, and many have seen the film enough to be able to quote these scenes, line for line.MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL is comedic genius. Simple as that. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). It is difficult to give movies of comedic nature any higher than 3 stars due to their subjectivity. Should enter my Top 300 at 283. Highly recommended.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
196,MetalAngel,My favourite comedy ever!,10,25 June 2010,"What does it take a film to be immortalized? What moves audiences and critics alike to carve a special place in history for them? James Cameron would argue that it's innovation in special effects; Francis Ford Coppola and Peter Jackson would have you know it's the depth of a story and its epic development through trilogies; Orson Welles was quite sure it was a film's ability to perform above its time and deal with perennial topics. They would all be correct, and their respective films have triumphed and remain must-sees to the world at large. But what would be Monty Python's answer to the above questions? How would the members of this perfect English troupe deal with the pure genius of their films and the depth of their comedy? They'd stand by the fact that, um, a good deal of moose, coconut-carrying African swallows, cheeky revolutionary peasants, 'Ni'-saying knights, Broadway-style numbers and a famous historian are the key to a great, pitch-perfect comedy that stands the test of time...and you know what? Even through their silliness, they'd be correct.Monty Python is a group of English thespians composed of Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and Michael Palin. Just to read their names together makes the reader raise his/her eyebrow in amusement, for their household names, synonyms of pure comedy. Monty Python gave England its laughs with their satirical, modern and outrageous humour reminiscent of Peter Cook, Harold Pinter and Samuel Beckett, and the few feature films they made together caused such uproar around the world that they're now considered utter classics by critics, film associations, cults, universities and families. ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"", possibly their most iconic film, is my personal favourite.The plot follows King Arthur, who has only just retrieved Excalibur from its stony perch and has been informed by the Lady of the Lake that he's to become the greatest king ever. He now travels through the entire country searching for brave, wise, gallant knights who'd like to join him at his round table at Camelot. Sounds quite epic and historical, doesn't it? Well, it's anything but. The film is hilariously nonsensical, too outrageous to be believed, silly at its core; it constantly strays from the plot to present different ridiculous sketches of the knights, it presents events that are not only unbelievable but preposterous...it is, in short, a farce of what comedies and epics have come to be. But unlike other silly movies like ""Scary Movie"", the film's parody is pure genius and manages to make heavy political, religious and cultural statements throughout, and the silliness is actually uproarious. I laugh every single minute of it, and younger audiences will find that, even if THEY'RE not doing so, the wit and intelligence underlying the ridiculous events astonish them. Audiences of every age and generation have found this to be a comic gem to be treasured.The film begins with THE wittiest opening credits I've seen to date. They're shown upon a black screen featuring ominous, dramatic music and Swedish subtitles. Through the course of the credits roll, the subtitles no longer translate what is being written in English but give out the weirdest, most non-sensical statements about moose; soon after the credits stop and a disclaimer announces that those responsible for the stupid subtitles have been sacked. The subtitles resume, and once again the disclaimer appears saying that those responsible for sacking have been sacked too. More credits appear, like ""Moose special effects,"" ""Moose trainers,"" ""Miss Avery's moose"", ""No moose have been harmed in the making of this film,"" etc...to the point where a third disclaimer appears saying that everyone responsible for the credits has been sacked and a new set of people have been quickly rounded up to finish the credit sequence, which grows sillier and sillier to the very end. The opening credits foretell the silliness of the film aptly, for the remaining hour and forty minutes is a wild and crazy romp that will have you in awe. Never (and I mean NEVER) has a film been simultaneously silly and profound like this.I can't name any particular scene to exemplify the film's genius. I rather have the reader rent or buy the film and be treated to its wonder without any warning of the surprises in store. There's epic fight scenes, outrageous musical numbers, heavy parody, controversial political and religious statements, interwoven modern scenes, some animation and, well, just about the best screen writing and acting I've ever seen. So...What DOES it take for a film to be immortalized? The answer is pure and simple: it needs to be the inspired work of geniuses, and Monty Python lives up to those standards.Please, if you know what's best for you, SEE THIS FILM! Rating: 4 stars out of 4!!",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
197,xmdbx,So Dumb It's Genius,7,15 July 2019,"It's not easy for me to imagine how hilarious this must've been when it first came out because I watched it for the first time 44 years after; long after its influence had already cemented itself in the worlds of comedy and cinema. Parts of it are still laugh-out-loud funny but some parts also come off as played-out because of how many times the certain trope or line of dialogue has been used since its release. For example, I could see myself laughing my ass of at the Black Knight scene but I'd seen the ""flesh wound"" meme so many times that I already knew what was happening. But, there were parts that did have that effect on me like the witch scene or any part to do with swallows. The nonsense humor, that I think was unheard of before this, is genius. The film is very funny and I can only wish to have seen it earlier to get the full effect.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

Im sure if you find it funny, its an hilarious film. But im rating this as a movie like i would for any other and therefore it deserves a 1/10, nothing higherAn 8.5 rating should be on a film which is actually a good MOVIE not a good sketch show (that for the record didn't make me laugh).

199,padiyark,Now watch this movie or I shall taunt you for a second time!,10,14 November 2011,"I will preface this by saying that while I'm not a big Monty Python fan, when they get it right, it is brilliant. The show had some great sketches, but some were just bizarre and incomprehensible. The movie is 100% on the mark, starting from the titles with subtitles to its off the wall ending.It would be a disservice to explain the movie and the great scenes in this review. But a few things to note.First, when you take into account that this film was done in 1974, most medieval movies of the time were glamorous set pieces with handsome knights and beautiful princesses. The Pythons skewered this notion completely: Arthur and his knights were commonplace blokes, and the sets were in some muggy, ugly areas. This may have been a budgetary issue, but interestingly enough, they probably depicted medieval England more authentically than even films nowadays.Second, the amount of times the fourth wall is broken are numerous, and just goes to shows how dementedly hilarious the movie gets, but yet still holds the story well.That said, if you have never seen Monty Python (who hasn't?), this is a whole different level of comedy--yes, silly is about right, but not in the crude ""Paul Blart"" or ""Larry the Cable Guy"" type of silly, but at the same time, not the cerebral ""Dr. Strangelove"" type of silliness.Must watch.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

Every character is stupid in their own way (apart from the peasants!) and Terry Gilliam's animation is equally witty and inventive. The overall dark tone and misty mise-en-scene only adds a certain quality and authenticity to the production and, believe me, doesn't make anything more serious!

I went to Monty Python and the Holy Grail when it was released and not knowing much about Monty Python.  It's a fabulously silly film that I still find myself quoting today.  (minor spoiler here) But, there was nothing quite like the ending, where the screen when blank, the curtain closed, and the lights came on.  It was such an abrupt shock it took a few minutes to get oriented. That's lost when you see it television or DVD.  BTW, don't watch this on network television.

204,johnmschofield,A film which was an unusual but true life changing experience for me,10,8 November 2009,When the Monty Python programmes started on British TV in the late 1960's I tuned into the humour from the first second and what made them that little bit more amusing was that my dad just didn't get any of it. We both laughed at other comedians or comedy films but the Monty Python experience was not one that appealed to him. I highly recommend anyone watch this film because you will find out whether you find it funny or not and from my point of view I hope you find it as highly amusing as I do. I cannot adequately describe the film itself its just the Monty Python experience in full flow and firing on all cylinders. I have watched the film numerous times and it still presses all my buttons where humour is concerned. This particular piece of cinematic brilliance had a life changing effect on me and although their will be many out there that will be doubtful or incredulous I myself have no doubts about how significant this film was for me. At the time the Monty Python team in my opinion were a groundbreaking new broom in comedy and set the standard which very few aspiring comedians have been able to match let alone emulate.

207,xiaoli7377,Zany and Fun; a Bit Overwhelming,8,11 September 2020,"""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is a cult comedy classic from the British comedy troupe Monty Python, who were famous at this point for hosting a sketch comedy show on British television. The group comprised of John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Graham Chapman, and Terry Jones. While I think ""The Holy Grail"" is certainly a funny movie, I don't think it's their best. I personally prefer ""Life of Brian"" for its religious satire, but I think ""The Holy Grail"" is more fondly remembered by most people for the amount of pop culture influence it carries and its fourth wall-breaking gags.The main problem I have with Monty Python's first picture is just the overall zaniness of the plot is a little overwhelming at times. Individual scenes are excellent, and Python always excelled at doing little bits that never exceeded five minutes in length. The problem is that this is a ninety minute motion picture, and I feel like the scenes seem cobbled together and all over the place. One moment we're watching the Knights of the Round Table give a musical number, then we have French soldiers hurling cows at our heroes, then we get fourth wall stuff with a modern day historian filming a documentary getting run in with a sword. It all feels a little disjointed.It's still very funny, but I feel like it lacks the focus and scope of ""Life of Brian."" The ending is also super underwhelming. Apparently it was supposed to be much more epic at one point but they had to come up with what they gave us due to budget and time. Kind of a let down.""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is a good laugh, and it's definitely one of the great comedy films from the 1970s. Watch it for the pop culture relevance, enjoy it for its silliness and lightheartedness. If you enjoy this, I suggest checking out the aforementioned ""Life of Brian"" and also Mel Brooks's ""Blazing Saddles"", which has a similar sort of ending but ends up a lot funnier and a lot more epic.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

209,thehappychuckler,"""I am your king."" ""Well, I didn't vote for you.""",9,29 September 2019,"Monty Python (or John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam, Graham Chapman and Eric Idle) brought their brilliant wit and smart humour to theatrical audiences back in 1975 with this nice little gem. If you have never seen Monty Python before it will either change your life and how you look at comedy or you will scratch your head and wonder what is so funny.In this farcical story King Arthur (to me a brilliant performance and played extremely straight by Graham Chapman) armed with his Knights of the Round Table is on his search for the Holy Grail.They come face to face with deadly black knights, killer rabbits and lonely lustful nuns to name a few.There really isn't a low point in the film as the laughs keep coming and ridiculous characters keep showing up. My favourite scenes are King Arthur's sword fight with the black knight (John Cleese), meeting the Knights Who Say Ni! lead by Michael Palin and dealing with the bridgekeeper (Terry Gilliam) of the Bridge of Death.While this is a film from Python about one thing that being King Arthur's quest for the Holy Grail it still to me has the soul of sketch comedy due to silly characters that show up for generally one scene and then you move onto the next character. Which to me is completely fine. I think this group may have been the absolute best at sketch comedy.Last night my fiancee, my sister, my niece and I went and saw this at a theatre, but it was very interactive. They gave you two halves of coconuts and lines to shout out to the screen. If you are a fan of Monty Python or this film it is not just highly recommended it is a must for those people.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
210,csagne,Faded and not replaced,5,9 October 2007,"There is indeed a lot in this film to bring it to cult status. The Holy Hand Grenade, Shrewberry and Knight that say Ni are so weird, beyond any measure that they have had no equivalent. It is wonderful that a film made with such a low budget could survive for so many years, but for me it just did not work, sorry.I also approached it with high expectations, I mean at 35 I only remembered watching it once when I was 8, and had only vague memories of it. Is it a matter of mood? Humour gone stale or repeated too often as ""a film they watched and they remember as great?"". Possibly. Some old films are better as memories than for what they are. For their cult status, once built, cannot be completely destroyed.Holy Grail is possibly one of them. Oh it still has its charm, especially its absurdity and the ""we had no budget, and we did better than you with a big one"". The Monty Python put a lot of talent there, and are still making a living out of those crazy years but 30 years on (yes, 30 years on), the comedy effect they achieve, which was such a breakthrough, has faded away, at least for a ""first time"" viewer of 2000. I do not mean something has come to replace it, except maybe Wayne's World, and this is probably the saddest conclusion. Nothing has really replaced the weird Monty Python. So watch this, enjoy it with all its faded absurd humour and hope the next laugh-out-loud film will come within your lifetime.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
211,dorotka24,Very silly yet brilliant,10,1 February 2008,"Like so many pleasures in life, the typical Monty Python fare is a bit of an acquired taste. Their comedy series, ""Flying Circus,"" had many funny moments, but I would estimate that 70% of it was just very silly stuff that was so outlandish and off the wall that it didn't have much of a wide appeal.Holy Grail had more than its share of silliness as well, but it seemed that the troupe really had outdone themselves here with clever and original material. Some of the bits were so outrageously funny that I must have nearly split my sides laughing at the first viewing with a few friends. And they hurt afterwards as well, so I was apparently not the only one who loved this type of humor.In typical Pythonesque fashion, much of the humor here is black comedy, with bits of gore sprinkled throughout. There was no swearing or nudity that I recall, which is odd for a comedy, instead there was a great deal of violence. It's almost a bit of a satire on the tendency for media outlets to be bastardized for nudity or sexuality, while extreme violence is often viewed as fine for all audiences.What it really amounted to was the Pythons making light of the oft untouchable British legend of the immortal King Arthur. There are so many quotable lines and bits of clever dialog that I could probably see the movie a hundred more times and still be heartily amused. This is a true comedy classic and should not be missed.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
212,stargunner,High rating should come with a warning label,7,24 December 2004,"Don't get me wrong, I understand how this film is considered humorous and well put together for its meager budget, but it being crowned one of the top movies ever made I find myself with my jaw dropped.How is this movie any different from the other purposely stupid comedies like Dumb and Dumber? People who find a liking to Monty Python think that those who don't like it just don't get the humor because it's too intelligent for them. Actually, on the contrary, they do get it and they just don't think it's funny. Monty Python is dumb humor, per se, and there's nothing really unique about it except its setting.If this movie deserves to be in the top 250 of comedy so do films like Dumb and Dumber, Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle do as well ... and i'm dead serious. The only reason this film is bumped so high is the thousands of those akin to nerd culture who for some reason highly value the movie come here and give it a 10/10.It's too silly and hollow to be given such a high status. It belongs to a certain group of moviegoers and, quite honestly the majority of people find no pleasure in this type of entertainment. To call it genius or the funniest movie ever made is exaggeration. It's good, but it isn't great; I honestly don't think it was filmed with the intention of making cinematic history.If that's one thing that makes it great, then you can treat it that way. But as far as I'm concerned, the high rating for this film is very misleading. It should come with a warning label:ACQUIRED TASTE.6/10.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
213,SamuraiNixon,I fart in your general direction!,9,2 March 2006,"One of my favorite comedies, and Monty Python's best and most irreverent movie is Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The Monty Python troop made three films and had a television series that challenged the status quo by dealing with religion, class welfare, politics and dead parrots. There humor seems as fresh and rebellious today as when it was aired. Sometimes their humor was forced -- some scenes in The Meaning of Lif(e) ; however, Monty Python and the Holy Grail has the perfect mix of antitoletarism, irreverence and silly sots.Speaking of silly sots, the cast of this film -- including Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, Michael Palin -- would later take Hollywood like a fierce Killer Rabbit. The kind that lops off men's 'eds' with fangs three-feet long. Monty Python never quite made the mainstream in America; nevertheless, its actors (and directors) did.Monty Python and the Holy Grail remains a cult favorite amongst geeky young males who play Magic in comic book shops. Many of these men grow up to be comic writers or shrubbery salesmen. These comic writers find many ways to allude (or just plain mention) many scenes in this movie. Examples are the Simpsons, the now defunct Freaks and Geeks and the title of Scorcese's Bringing Out the Dead. However, there is more to this film than fanatical fans. It is the antithesis to The Rocky Horror Picture Show, it is a cult movie that is actually good.Reviews on movies like this one are difficult to write because the charm and essence of the film are in its characters and insane skits. Recapping the plot does nothing to convey the essence of the film unless you write it in an irreverent or silly manner. Since I am beyond that type of blasphemous writing, I should either plod on or quit and do my laundry.I would rather do my laundry later, so I will go on.This film was loosely based on King Arthur and the Holy Grail. I am also sure this film was loosely based on a script. Though the plot is chaotic and the cast few, the movie is funny and witty. My only disagreement with the movie is the forced ending.

219,josephrygaard,Before Watching: Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975),8,13 August 2019,"""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" (1975) is a genius piece of British comedy. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:This movie is absolute nuts. First some cautions, though - there is some gore and blood (although so over-the-top is comedic), a few scenes which might be classified as religiously offensive, and a longer scene which is highly sexually suggestive. All these things can be uncomfortable for people that are sensitive to the respective categories and should in that case be taken into account.As for the rest of the movie, it is insane. Humor is usually created when there is a plot-twist that deviates from one's expectations, and in that sense, this movie is nothing but humor. Its sole purpose is to make sure the viewer never stands steady and comfortable in what to expect, and that this the only expectation one can have. If quirky yet brilliant and genius humor like this is appreciated, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is an absolute feast, and make sure to watch the Special Editions that features the short ""Dentist On the Job.""My personal grade: a hilarious 8/10.

221,kclambeth,"""Is that an African swallow?""",10,10 April 2008,"I love this film and slightly prefer it to the Life of Brian (which is hilarious) I only saw this for the first time last year and was so glad i finally got to see it after many years of wanting to.The Pythons have such a unique style of comedy that at the time was groundbreaking, it's not as shocking or controversial by today's standards but the point is they weren't afraid to take risks or not do something for fear of looking stupid.Set in legendary King Arthur's England, King Arthur (played brilliantly by Graham Chapman) and his knights set upon a quest to find the holy grail. The quest takes them to the most ludicrous places (like the castle Anthrax) and they face the most bizarre situations (the bridge of death to name but one) and meet some peculiar characters including the Knights of Ni.The acting is great with Chapman as King Arthur and the other pythons playing many small roles, each very talented and individually skilled. There are many laughs, my favourite part being the conversation about the migrating swallows. I really enjoyed this film and think more young people should see it, it is one of the few films labelled as a comedy that actually makes me laugh.Although it is over thirty years old, it doesn't feel dated to me, it has a contemporary feel to it and i think it will still be popular in thirty years time. This is in my opinion the best film they have done; 'Life of Brian' is a close second but wasn't too impressed with 'the meaning of life'.Anyways a must see and deservedly in the top 250.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
222,jonsefcik,"Great Beginning, Great End, Dull Middle",8,25 September 2018,"I rewatched this movie for the first time in almost 10 years to see if it still held up. Did it? Kind of. The first 20-30 minutes are great, the last 20 minutes are great, but the middle really drags.Everything from the beginning of the film to the point where the knights split up is superb. The false opening, the second false opening, coconuts, swallows, ""tis but a scratch"", monster hand turning the book pages, the Trojan bunny, that stuff was great. Once the knights split up, the movie screeches to a dead halt for 40 minutes. The scenes were basically unrelated skits that meandered about to pad the running time to theatrical length. This wouldn't be so bad if these scenes were at least funny, but they weren't. I didn't laugh or even chuckle once through this whole stretch. Sir Robin, Galahad, Lancelot, none of it did it for me. The Knights Who Say Ni was the only somewhat humorous thing, mostly because of how stupid it was. Once they reunite, things start picking up again. The killer bunny, The Man From Scene 24 at the bridge, intermission, getting arrested, all classic stuff. Had the middle section been heavily trimmed, this could have been fantastic, but that middle section really bogged the movie down to just ""very good"" for me. Apart from the humor, I'll say the film looks good given its small budget, and the foggy locations give it some nice atmosphere. Comedy can be very subjective, so how much you enjoy this film is dependent on your sense of humor. If you're not a fan of British humor, you're going to hate it, but if the first half hour grabs you, you'll probably enjoy it.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
223,vbz,The Blueprint of Modern Black Comedy,10,4 January 2000,"Where do you think such hip 90's favorites as ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Clerks"" and ""South Park"" got their inspiration? Just one of the many influences: does the irreverent discussion of European vs. African swallows remind you of John Travolta/Samuel L. Jackson's famous ""quarter pounder with cheese"" exchange ? To be fair, Monty Python itself hails from an important tradition of subversive humor that, at least in the cinematic world dates back to the days of Buster Keaton. Then of course, came the Marx Brothers,  the Golden Age of Warner Bros. Cartoons (1937-1957, arguably THE most influential humor of the century), and ""Dr.Strangelove"". But Monty Python really set the pace for the kind of absurdist satire we know and love today. The impact of ""Holy Grail"" reaches far and wide - from Michael Keaton's horseless galloping in Kenneth Branagh ""Much Ado about Nothing"" to the Columbine High Shootings(""It's just a flesh wound"" was reputedly a favorite quote of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold).",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

Excelent combination of fisical humour and inteligent lines, with a low budget, meaning good, production. The black knight, the knights that say Ni, the rabbit and the holy grenade, the witch trial, the Troya rabbit, the Anthrax castle and everything else in this movie make this the very best comedy ever, beating classics like Naked Gun, Hot Shots and Austin Powers.9/10",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
225,dragonshield,"The word ""laughter"" will have a whole new meaning",9,6 May 2007,"I'm not a fan of Monty Python and that is only because of one reason, I've never actually seen the series more than a couple of times, and neither one of the movies. Despite from that, I'm familiar with its humour and I do know how legendary it is in the history of comedy. I just saw ""Monthy Python and the Holy Grail"" this night and I can't believe I've missed a masterpiece of a quality comedy. I mean, I haven't laughed that hard in ages, probably never that hard before this movie. It is so hilarious that you just can't stop laughing in certain parts of the movie and it is a definite celebration of comedy throughout, right from the beginning right to the end.I don't know where to start. When I've reviewed movies before, I've judged it by all the usual things; Directing, screenplay, role performances, cinematography and all that, but when it comes to this movie those categories can't be described with words, they just can't be described reasonably. I could always try, but I guess that just wouldn't make any sense. The movie's just so silly that simple rules of how movies are made don't apply. Stupid some may say, but I say it's just genius.Although I just mentioned above that this movie can't be reviewed like ordinary movies, I will try. Just for the fun of it. What comes to directing, well, it isn't something you pay attention to, as it just isn't even so important for the film itself. The things you see on the screen are the only things that matter. What comes to role performances, well, there actually aren't any actual ""performances"". Every actor is excellent and do what they are supposed to do, taking it slightly too far than it's meant to. I know, it's a bit tricky, but that's the purpose of it. An intelligent purpose that is.The screenplay is in this case very hard to judge, because you don't actually know if there exists an actual ""screenplay"". According to IMDb there is and no else than the Monty Python boys themselves have written it; Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and Michael Palin. Obviously they all are starring in the movie as well. There are two options when it comes to the screenplay: Either it's the longest damn script after the script of ""The Return of the King"" ever written or then it's the shortest one. What I mean is that you just can't know if the scenes are improvised, because by judging what I saw, the whole movie could be improvised. There's just stuff in it which no other than the Monty Python boys could come up with, just brilliant. I'm not going to analyse the screenplay more specifically, because I don't want to give away any spoilers for those who haven't seen the movie yet. One thing is certain and it is that the movie's just mad in any imaginable way, it's so ridiculous it's beyond ridiculous and that is what makes it so damn good.""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is among the best (if not The Best) comedies I've ever laid my eyes on, it's a movie you can not describe with words, it's a movie you have to see with your own eyes. Your lungs's air capacity will empty, scene after a scene. Surely mine did. I'm recommending the movie for everyone, for the fans, for those who just like Monty Python and especially for those who haven't seen any Monty Python's before. Believe me, I immediately felt this huge filling in my knowing-of-comedy -gap, a must see film indeed.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
226,matthewnoorman,Comedy for Intellectuals,10,19 March 2020,"Monty Python and The Holy Grail is the ultimate nonsense comedy. A comedy film filled with nonsense jokes and dry humor. This film is way ahead of its time and still holds up as one of the greatest of all time. The writting is outstanding, performances are hilarious and the situations these buffoons get themselves into are entertaining and endlessly funny.
One of the best comedies to ever be made!",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
227,filmbuff-05706,A Python Laugh Riot-9.5/10 stars:,9,27 July 2020,"I was at an open house and I got bored so I was invited to watch TV in the house. They had Netflix, so I skimmed through the menus for a movie. Searching through ""Classics"" I found Monty Python and the Holy Grail. I hadn't seen it in maybe 5 years, so I put it on. And it's funnier now than it was before!Holy Grail is the first of 3 Monty Python movies(The latter ones being The Life of Brian and The Meaning of Life), and it follows King Arthur and his men on a quest from God to seek the Holy Grail, the cup Jesus drank from at the Last Supper. However, their divine quest has many bumps on the way, but they won't give up until the cup is found!This is considered to be one of the greatest comedies ever made, and rightfully so. There are many scenes that are not only hilarious but also quite iconic. Take a scene where a random woman is falsely accused of being a witch and setenced to burning at the stake. Or a scene where a knight is dismemebered with a sword and attempts to fight back with his arms and legs missing. And then there is arguably the most famous scene, in which Arthur and his men are taunted by John Cleese as a French Man.The jokes come from left and right and many land, though some pass by if you are not so keen on the Medieval Era jokes. I also found that the first few jokes did not work for me-like a subtitle joke in the opening credits. This is why I gave the movie a 9.5 and not a 10. Even still, Holy Grail is a laugh riot that is sure to pick up a lower mood.Aside from the funny scenes, Holy Grail contains some iconic quotes as well, ones like: "" 'Tis just a flesh wound!"", ""Bring out your dead!"", ""Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of Elderberries!"", the list could go on. These quotes and aforementioned scenes show how this movie has affected culture just 45 years later.In fact, if you have seen the Christian animated series Veggie Tales, you can see how this movie has influenced the show. This is because the creator, Phil Vischer, considers this to be one of favorite movies of all time. In his first video: Where's God When I'm S-Scared, there is a reference to the ""Not the curtains lad"" scene from this movie. And in Josh and the Big Wall, the French Man scene is parodied throughout.As I have said, I am giving this a 9.5 and not a 10 because the first few jokes didn't land. That may not be the case for you, and if so, more power to you. I don't think this minor bump is worth that much in the long run- the laughs, skits, and story all make up for it throughout. If you love comedies, consider this a must see classic!I also should mention that 2 brothers, about 8 years old if I had to guess, came in the middle of the movie. I got nervous due to the fake looking but graphic violence, and I was also considerate of the language(S**t was said before, but in their presence only God's name was taken in vain.) Luckily, they didn't seem to mind the violence and many jokes went over their heads(They found the 3 question scene funny though!) Besides, they also spent most of the time on their tablets.There was a scene where someone mentions wanting oral sex. I can't remember if the kids were present then, but if they were they didn't ask what that was or anything. I asked Quora if I should have seen that with them and most of them said it proabaly went over their heads anyway. Still, consider this if you are watching with kids around, or for parental guidance for your child. My personal suggestion is 10 and up, depending on the child.Monty Python and the Holy Grail is most certainly one of the greatest comedies of all time, and fans of classic movies and comedies should see this one. If you are on a quest for a great comedy, I assure you that you have succeeded!",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

To be honest, I had what I once thought was an unfair advantage in appreciating the Monty Python brand of humor, since I lived in England in the late '60s watching John Cleese, Michael Palin, Terry Jones, et al hone their skills until they joined together to became THE FUNNIEST PEOPLE ON EARTH!Sorry.  Lost it again.Anyway, it's been such a pleasant surprise to see that so many people (Although obviously not EVERYONE) in America can fully appreciate Monty Python.  And I can rest assured knowing I'm not alone in believing MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL is a masterpiece of humor.  Just start quoting lines from it sometime and see how often other people know what you're talking about...or even better, can quote the next line in the scene!  And to think this film was made for something like $50,000...It has always been a great source of pleasure for me that my late father, a career NCO in the U.S. Air Force, loved this movie as much as I did.And by the way...A moose once bit my sister.No, really!",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

King Arthur and what's left of the troupe are charging a French castle but are stopped.... by the cops! They load King Arthur in the back of a police van and we end with a cop blacking out a camera!

I just don't get it. Or maybe, they didn't get it. Several reviews remarked that ""it looked cheap"", or it was ""silly"", and that there was ""poor acting"". The only thing I can figure is that these reviewers must be under the age of 13, or at least have the IQ of someone under thirteen. You do need to have studied a bit of English history or at least watched one of the many King Arthur movies made in the past 50 years. Do high school kids read the Canterbury Tales anymore? But if you're under 12 or limit your movie watching to ""kick in the crotch"" comedy, this might be a little over your head. What are kids learning about in History nowadays? I only ask because neither my 17 year old nephew or any of his friends found this movie funny. They just stared at it like they didn't understand WHY it was funny! Maybe the dumbing down of our education system is really happening after all.

If you were to judge it based on themes, acting, or any other (usually) important details, then you would have been greatly disappointed. Fortunately, the humor is enough to make you die laughing. Once you recover, you'll be begging for more. The first time I saw this movie I just couldn't stop laughing. It was like watching Seinfeld with British accents.

This film just was really not all that funny to me though seriously. Everybody says that this movie is hilarious and it's entertaining well to be honest it's nether. This movie to my opinion is on my top 10 of worst films. This film of course is number 4 on the list because it managed to make me laugh once and only once. People say this movie is good so I will recommend this film to little kids. But other than that I just can not see why this is so funny.

I guess it just goes to show that good writers & actor/comedians make up for a low budget.  Of course director Terry Gilliam went on to bigger budget and special effects laden galas.  But this first effort is still quite remarkable both in the zany & irreverent storyline as well as the hilarious performances from the Monty Python crew.  Even with the surprise ending (according to Gilliam the money had run out so they had little choice but a quick finish) the comedy still holds up well and will hopefully continue down the years.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

They also had a scale model of the Trojan Rabbit in the lobby.From the subtitled opening credits to the abrupt ""film break"" which closes out the film I was in stitches. More than that, it holds up. Some comedies you can watch once or twice and you're done. Not this film.A couple of words about the new Deluxe Edition DVD: buy it.

All the funny stuff. You would think that a 30-year-old movie wouldn't be this funny, but I guess I am proved wrong. This is rightly in the top 250. Obviously the funniest and best Python film. And the six guys who are playing all the main characters are sort of...spread out, if that makes any sense. For instance, in The Meaning of Life, you would see Eric Idle, Eric Idle, Eric Idle, and then Palin, Palin, Palin, and you would barely ever see Gilliam or Chapman. In this, there's a bit of each. Another great thing is that, if you listen to the commentary (I'm a total Monty Python DORK), the people commenting seem to be pretty happy with their movie as well.

What I found in those videos nowadays, I also find it in ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"". Yes, that's one makes me amazed when I watch it. I mean, Monty Python used the entire movie elements to make its iconic comedy. From the first one, you can see the absurd credit and its annoying subtitle, which is make no sense, just a fun in it. The very unimportant dialog, that makes the audience always said, ""Get on with it"" as its statement repeat in some scenes. In a one way, you can say it's worse movie, the story is not clear, and you will never find anything, except for its comedy cinematography.Honestly, I just laugh in some part of the movie, yes the comedy is not fit from me as an Indonesian. I mean, American comedy, even the old comedy, is very different with Indonesian comedy. I know it from learning riddle and watching movie itself.

245,keuhkokala,Ekki-ekki-ekki-ekki-z'Bang zoom-Boing z'nourrrwringmmmni,9,28 September 2004,"First of all I think it's unfair of comedies to get a big cult status. If the best jokes come too well known, the element of surprise is gone. This happened to me for example in the case of This is Spinal Tap. I had heard about the Stonehenge gag, the amplifier that goes up to 11 and the part where they get lost. So, if you haven't seen this movie yet, I suggest you wouldn't read this, because it really does spoil great comedy, if you know too much about it in the first place.The movie is set in medieval England ...or is it? Maybe I should start again.This one is probably the funniest of all Monty Python movies, but not the best. The clever satire of Life of Brian and the wonderful visual feast of the Meaning of Life make them superior to this. There's really not anything more than a bunch of typical pythonesque sketches in this one. Which, of course isn't a bad thing at all.It's said often, that because the movie's budget was very low is why they had to use the infamous coconuts instead of horses. But then again, how come they had enough money for the Trojan rabbit, the army of celts in the end or Tim the enchanter's explosions? Well, most of the action sequences are animated anyway. And that's another plus, because this is the only Python movie, where the great Terry Gilliam animations pop up as often as they did in Flying Circus. Maybe because making them gave Terry a heart attack (in the movie, at least), he only animated the opening credits in LOB and MOL. Too bad, because this has also the best and funniest opening credits, ever! Signed, Richard M. Nixon.The Pythons really are genius in both writing and acting. Particularly funny are Cleese as the Frenchman and the Black Knight, Chapman as King Arthur, Palin as the leader of the knights of Ni and Dennis, Idle as the Dead Collector and Sir Robin, Jones as Prince Herbert and sir Bedevere and even the rarely seen Terry Gilliam has his Bridgekeeper, one of the funniest characters of the whole movie. All of the characters have also enormous amounts of memorable quotes and that makes this without a doubt the most quoted movie of all times. That just proves that even if the movie has some years to it, it hasn't lost any of it's appeal just because some new comedies like There's something about Mary and American Pie go even deeper into the pile of bad taste. Give me the cartoon-violent Black Knight scene over the sperm-as-hair-gel any day!***** (9/10)The best part: (SPOILERs) The hack 'n slash Black Knight scene is the best splatter sequence from a non-splatter movie! Also I really love the Bridge of Death (Answer these questions three: What is your name? What is your quest? What is your favorite colour? You wouldn't think answering those could be THAT hard) and of course, everyone's favorite monster, the Killer rabbit and favourite villains, the Knights who say Ni (or Ekki-ekki-ekki-ekki-z'Bang zoom-Boing z'nourrrwringmmmni) who want some nice shrubberies, which are not too expensive and make people cut down trees with a herring.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is Monty Python's classic humor at its best and definitely most amusing. How can you not laugh at the truly witty and ingenious humor and at the hilarious characters? Many people who watch this are promptly struck with severe cases of what I like to call ""Monty Pythonitis"", an extremely contagious disease where the person enjoying ""Monty Pythonitis"" (yes, enjoying) finds themselves waking up in the middle of the night yelling ""NI!

Reading that might make you think that I hate the movie, but that is exactly why it is a funny and well known movie to everyone.Nothing really happens in the movie other than the Knights of the Round Table looking for the Holy Grail, while in the process random things happen to throw you off and make you laugh until you are on the ground in pain. I still remember that night at my cousins, after drinking 10 cans of coke and I would not stop laughing. ""We are the knights that say NI"" was the funniest part in the whole movie and made me laugh the hardest. Like whats so random is why NI? Such as random word, but that's why that is funny. Shotly after I watched the movie I said NI to everyone that passed, and it scared people. 10/10.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

Monty Python did a hilarious work of art which most comedians have seen a billion times. The films starts out with a horseless King Arthur (instead banging two coconuts together.) looking for knight to join his new organization The Kinghts Of The Round Table, after a guard explains logic to him, it gets downright hilarious from there. If it won an award it would probably be 'A Comedy You Saw 12 Billion Times But Still Laugh At.' Kids would also love this film even if they never heard of King Arthur, don't leave them with some High School Musical crap or something.

Whereas Brian concentrates on a historical story that I can relate to strongly, this does the same but with English History.  The Python's run the same kind of spin on a famous yarn, pointing out how ridiculous the concept of The Holy Grail (and hence, the English Church) is.What does work is the appearance, to me, that they are producing a performance that would fit onto a stage and turning it into a film, which is one of the strongest points of this film.Ultimately, it isn't funny enough to be a great film, but if you've not seen this or The Life of Brian I would recommend both to ascertain just what the Python's were trying to achieve.  No particular order as you'll need to watch both.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

The lines flow after each other so perfectly and naturally that every one becomes the punchline of the one before it. Classic examples are the Politically Aware Peasants, (""Help Help I'm being repressed!"") the Logic of Witch Burning, (""If she weighs the same as a duck, she's made of wood- and therefore... a witch!"") the warning of Tim the Enchanter (""Death awaits you all; with nasty big pointy teeth!"") and so on. The film does have a few dud gags, in particular the tale of Sir Lancelot, but these are far outnumbered by the good (""Allo daffy English Kniggits and Messeur Arthur King who has the brain of a duck you know!""). Despite its self-deprecating tagline, this film feels like an epic, especially since it was made for less than the cost to cater a modern Hollywood film, and is beautifully shot. Perhaps the most innocent and sweet-natured of the Python's films, it still features a liberal amount of sensless murder and bleakness, particularly near the beginning and end. It is still the most addictive of their films.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

I've got to admit it was pretty good when I finally saw it and if I would have waited a few more months it probably would have been better and if I had waited a few years it probably would have been great. I waited twenty years to see Spaceballs and when it was finally forced upon me I watched it with an attempted open mind but kept comparing the flick unfavorably to other Brooks films like Blazing Saddles, Young Frankenstein, High Anxiety, Silent Movie,and The Producers. I came away with the reinforced bias that Mel lost his touch after Silent Movie. I held out for almost thirty years on Monty Python. Then to my alarm my twelve year old daughter Mary told me that Monty Python was the funniest movie she had ever seen. I like Mary's taste and when I told her that I had never seen Holy Grail, she was surprised and encouraged me to rent the DVD which I did. I played it last night and yup, I loved it. Truly an original film. We laughed and now everybody is walking around going ""neeth"" etc. Of the three Grail is the best, Redemption second and Spaceballs a distant third.

HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! i love that line! it then goes on to another favorite scene of mine with Dennis. he was quite the menace for the king. heh...get it? menace? Dennis? it was the....never mind....the film then plays out with oh so many funny scenes and meaningless arguments that you'll die laughing. this is the perfect film for Saturday night or any other day for that matter. totally recommended to anyone in any age! watch it over and over and over again!",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

256,Budd-5,An acquired taste!,8,4 September 1999,"Monty Python's Flying Circus was a hit and miss comedy series consisting of a group of Englishmen performing some comedic sketch and then moving on to something completely different. The sketches were so different and so many that you were bound to find at least one sketch funny. A movie, it seemed wouldn't allow them to do silly sketches, it would have to form a much stricter pattern. Not for the Pythons, it doesn't.Monty Python and the Holy Grail is still just a series of sketches with a Medieval theme. But unlike the TV series, here most of the sketches work. When you throw so many jokes at the audience you're guaranteed to have success.John Cleese is marvellous particularly as Sir Lancelot but also as the Frenchman. Graham Chapman is as usual the straightman to the rest of the Python's fun but he is also good as Arthur, King of the Britons. The rest of the crew give some of their best work and the animation which was particularly annoying in the series is used sparingly here.If you like Pythons you'll adore this. If you don't, don't give it a miss it might surprise you. It's certainly an acquired taste but for a fan it's one of the funniest films ever.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

259,YbsuhA,"Overrated, but funny.",7,20 March 2021,"Monty Python And The Holy Grail is often regarded as one of the funniest movies ever made. I won't say I disagree, but honestly, I do.The first time I watched Monty Python And The Holy Grail, I was like «Nah, Life Of Brian's better». I watched a lot of reaction videos to this movie just to understand what was so funny with this movie, cause I didn't understand everything that was supposed to be funny. I decided to give it another try, and it was much funnier the second time.It's still no funnier than Life Of Brian (a movie few movies can beat), it's far from one of the funniest ever made, but it is at times hilarious and extremely funny. The movie is pretty old though, but most of the humour isn't. Let me just say that some humour never gets old. Even though they couldn't be made today, they are still very funny. Examples? Blazing Saddles (1974), Airplane! (1980), Hot Shots (1991), other Monty Python movies (Life Of Brian (1979), and The Meaning Of Life (1983)). They are all very funny, though they are old.Monty Python And The Holy Grail is a comic adventure movie with some memorable scenes. Some of them are the intro, the beginning, the end, something in the middle, but the funniest is probably the knight fight (which is one of the most iconic scenes from the movie). This is a hilarious scene that has been spoofed a lot of times. It is as funny as they say it is, but the movie isn't.This movie is just amazingly funny, but there is some funnier movies in the world. Just know that this is far from a waste of time, and you will have a good time with it (probably more than me).",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

I don't hate this movie one bit, but I do think the humor has aged. I don't laugh as hard because Monty Python humor has influenced every other comedy out there, and thus it's like I've seen it before. I'm sure in 1975 everything in this film would have been out of nowhere and nonsense. After seeing a movie like Anchorman, it's hard to say I laughed as much because Anchorman is so much more out there. It outdoes this film. But regardless, I appreciate this film, as I appreciate Monty Python, because I know it did a lot for comedy. Without it, there'd probably be no Anchorman as we know it.GOODThe WRITING is good. Even for a nonsense comedy, it creates some likable characters and interesting scenarios. JOKES ARE PROPERLY SET-UP and even though the film essentially uses the set-up-punchline by scene formula rather than focusing heavily on a story, everything feels relevant enough (unlike a 100 Hundred Ways to Die in the West or whatever that movie was called).The ACTING is great. Not much to say, but you never feel like your watching an actor. While the COMEDY is aged from what I saw, it still had some very funny moments. And I'm sure if I saw the film drunk or with friends, I would laugh a lot more. BADThe only bad thing about this very influential film is that the COMEDY HAS AGED. Movies like Anchorman have outdone it, at least for my generation. VERDICT8/10It's a well-made low-budget film that's had a noticeable impact on comedy. While I can't enjoy it like someone who lived in the 70's, I still found it funny at some points and perhaps some others would even find it funnier than I did. Maybe it's just not my type of comedy. Either way, I won't deny this film deserves every bit of praise it gets. It just won't get a 10/10 from me.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

From ""Bring out your dead"" to the Frenchman at the end making fun of King Arthur. This movie is to Monty Python what Animal House is to national Lampoon. The only difference is that Monty Python is, in my opinion, much funnier and less sexual then National Lampoon. And, no offense intended, the British accents just make the film even funnier.

End of Story.,10,2 June 2004,"Few movies in the history of movies inspire its fans to memorize every scene, every bit of dialogue, every microscopic nuance to be brought out later at social gatherings. Such is Monty Python and the Holy Grail.The Pythoners once said in an interview that when they wrote their characters, their scripts, it was NEVER about what they thought would make millions of people laugh. It was about what made the six of THEM laugh, and that is a fitting testament to Python's genius.John Cleese once commented that the British are a people who are desperate to be made fun of. When many people think of England, the first images most people the world over conjure up are either the horrible weather or the stuffed shirts that make up the aristocracy. The best British comedies through the years. Python, Benny Hill and the Black Adder series, to name a few, were all made immortal because they railed against the stiff, boring world they grew up in by displaying the wacky irreverence that made even the status quo laugh.The Knights Who Say ""Nee!"" The French Taunter. The Castle Anthrax. The Rabbit. Lancelot's stint at Swamp Castle. ""Bring Out Your Dead."" The Bridge Keeper. You mention these things to people, and they instantly know what you mean, even if the name of the movie hasn't even come up! But even the smaller bits are worthy of remembrance: The Opening Credits. The Coconuts. The Witch Trial. Sir Robin's Minstrels. The old man clapping on the dungeon wall. The 10-second (PSYCH!) intermission. The Holy Hand Grenade.

274,guedesnino,"""Monty Python"" makes it clear that the highlight will always be the joke, the laughter.",8,18 June 2017,"The philosopher Henri Bergson devoted much of his studies on comedy, as we can see in his book (TEST ON THE MEANING OF THE COMIC). In this work, which breaks down the foundation of laughter, Bergson points to an idea in which the English comedy group ""Monty Python"" uses it almost as a thesis, in the case: Laughter is the mechanics applied to the living being.In ""Monty Python & the Holy Grail"" (1975), we have all the distribution of a mechanics applied subtly, without toadyism's or presented in a mandatory way in order to provoke the amusement of the public, although it is a comedy, it is not performed Openly as conventionally other films of the genre are proposed, something that can be verified in the film ""The Meaning of Life"", later work of that same group, that uses of ""sketches"", something simplistic and shallow in the construction of conceited, mainly if we consider The complexity of the comic effect employed in a feature film with focal and linear history.The comedy whose main satire focus is on the legend of King Arthur, is a work written and performed by the group Monty Python and which was directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones. The satire employed expands its limits by showing a king on a sacred mission, and who, because he is a believer of his condition, provokes laughter by having this severity interrupted by riding on an imaginary animal which exists only through the beating of a coconut, A sound effect entrusted to his helper Patsy (Terry Gilliam), the sonority is enough for King Arthur of the Bretons (Graham Chapman) to believe to possess a horse that accompanies him through the English lands. This effect not only of the sound, but of a king almost in the mold of the Danish tale ""The new clothes of the king"", where a noble parades naked, but believing to dress a beautiful clothes, therefore, his tailor told him, in King Arthur's crazy, imaginative stance added to the sound of the coconuts will be calculations resulting from a recurring mechanical summation in the film, something Bergson identifies as the mechanics of repetition for laughter.""Repeat, a combination of circumstances repeated exactly on several occasions, in stark contrast to the changing course of life - the more comic the repetition (or coincidence) the more complex the repeated scene is and the more natural it is represented (two Conditions - complexity and naturalness that seem to be excluded, and which the ability of the theatrical author should reconcile) "". Bergson, 1900.The highlight of this characteristic repetition in ""Monty Python & the Holy Grail"" is the sophistication in which it is built, and in the moments when it is inserted, therefore, it is something that runs the risk of being tiring or beaten but that in the movie exercises A charm to the point of wanting more. The same effect occurs in all circumstances in which King Arthur and his companions attempt to invade castles, but never succeed. Since the attempts, these different, always fail, even when they prove to be an excellent idea, as in the attempt to mold the Trojan horse, which in the film is replaced by a large wooden rabbit handed over to the French.An interesting division made to know each of the Knights of the Round Table in detail is a break with the Brecht theatrical model, a break with the fictional narrative, presenting a historian (current to the period in which the work was performed), and Of a television program, explains or tries to explain what happened to the knights, but a tragicomic outcome is given to the teacher, this unused break for free, gains permanent prominence as we feed back the plot of the film, evoking moments of Laughs through the repetition of interruptions of medieval history by a modern police investigation.Direction and photography make primary recording slips, in some scenes, for example, there is lens blur, and the use of open planes can not always communicate the size of what one wants to reveal, perhaps this occurs for a budget limit , Since many of the plains scenes are flattened in medium planes that do not account for registering castles and settlements (something that needs investments for construction), already in the dark scenes or of mists, the use of close's, big close's and open plans , Rather than assisting in any dialogue, only complicates and diminishes the intended comic effect.It is worth mentioning that the moments of insertion of the animations are all very well inserted, besides the impeccable art that collaborates and helps in the construction of a comic proposal, and even being drawings inserted in a human history, are used naturally. As Bergson explains, this occurs when a certain comic effect derives from a certain cause, the more natural we are to judge, the greater the comic effect will seem to us: we already laugh at the deviation which appears to us as a simple fact. More risible will be the deviation that we see arise and increase before us, whose origin we know and whose history we can reconstitute. The cause of the insertion of these drawings into the film are always the results of a world and a divine order, which leave the terrestrial plane and present themselves as the world of the human extra-plane, and are recorded just like the illustrations of the catholic church in the middle ages , However, without the seriousness of the trait of the church, but always of the comic trait.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

This film makes that grade and as such joins an elite of less than a dozen films.Everything that could possibly have gone right with this film did, from the ingenious opening to the laughable ending. One set of hilarious sketches after another including jokes about the monarchy, foreign nationals, troy, fabled mythical beasts, the constitution of the knights and God himself. The ending was perfect in my opinion because there never was a story in the first place. It was simply Monty Python at it's very best acting out a set of themed sketches with no real direction. To finish that with a proper ""ending"" would be to disrespect the film, themselves and the viewer.Encompasing a wide and varied range of knowledge, from Greek Myth to Arthurian Legend, and from Political Philosophy to botany and zoology, this film displays the vast depth of knowledge of it's creators. It never fails to amuse and is, among a wide section of the British populace, communally quoteable.I wouldn't hasten to recommend this film to anyone, and if you don't like it at least a bit then there surely must be something wrong with you.

279,Andrew-162,I wouldn't change a thing,10,4 February 2000,"This movie is the pinacle of comedy. There is no comedy that is better quality or funnier than this one. In a decade where comedy is at it's alltime lowest (with Deuce Bigalo, Male Gigolo and She's All That being high rankers) it's refreshing to still be able to refer back to such a glorious comedy.The ideas of this movie are hilarious, namely these 6:1. The idea of having the knights pretend to be riding horses, and having servants clank coconuts in the background to make it sound like horse hooves. 2. The trojan horse 3. The ""She's A Witch, Burn Her!"" theory 4. Having a God that is irritable and whiny 5. The idea of a man-eating rabbit and a religious hand grenade to expose of it (in biblical fashion, of course) 6. The idea to cut off the big battle scene at the end by a bunch of policemen.The film is a spoof, obviously, but should not be treated on the same level of ""Robin Hood: Men In Tights"". It is the wittiest, funniest, and zaniest commedy of all time, and it's screenplay is probably one of the three best original screenplays ever (Up there with Pulp Fiction and the Usual Suspects). The acting is great, and works so well with the movie. There are many memorable scenes worth quoting again, and again, and again. See this movie several hundred times.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
280,roberjruiz,Just childish humor,4,15 February 2014,"Before watching this film, the only Monty Pithon film I knew was ""Life of Brian"". I really loved that film, and some of my friends told me that ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" was even funnier. May be it was because I had such a great expectations, but the film really disappointed me.I would't say it's crap, I admit the movie has a few funny jokes. But generally I found it just ridiculous and childish. Senseless jokes without any further objective than ridiculing some Middle Ages myths. And don't misunderstand me, I have nothing against humor that tries to ridicule myths. It's just that I didn't find funny most of the jokes.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
281,Vegie,My best friend Antony knows every line in this classic movie. What is it about this movie that attracts the nutters?,10,19 September 1998,"This 1974 flick is one of the all time greats. You either love it or loathe it, much like the other Python flicks. Many like ""The Life of Brian"" more than this, but despite 'Bigus Dickus', it's nowhere near as funny as this bloody tale of Arthur, King of the Britons(""King of the WHO?""), and his knights of the Round Table; Sir Lancelot the Brave, Sir Galahad the Pure, Sir Bedevere, Sir Robin the-not-so-brave as Sir Lancelot, and Sir-not appearing in this film. In their quest for the holy grail, they encounter Tim the Enchanter, the Knights who say Ni, a ferocious bunny rabbit(""With big great pointy teeth""), and a horde of foul temptress virgins. Not to mention the Black Knight. Classic stuff...just don't tell anyone you like it, or they'll think you're a nerd...oops, too late. Cast includes John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Michael""The Nice One""Palin, Eric Idle, Neil Innes, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam, Carol Cleveland etc.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
282,Predator-11,The silliest of Python movies,9,15 June 2001,"Holy Grail is easily the silliest of all the Python movies, save And Now For Something Completely Different which isn't really a movie at all but a series of some of the better sketches from the Flying Circus. Of course saying that Holy Grail is silly certainly isn't insulting it in any way, it may be the funniest Python movie ever made, although the humor isn't for everyone. The pure randomness and all out impossibility of everything that happens is what makes it so funny, this is definatly present in their other films but generally not to the degree that is seen in Holy Grail. I have a hard time deciding whether Holy Grail or Life of Brian is the better movie, while Holy Grail tends to get more overall laughs, Life of Brian's jokes seem more intelligent and well thought out. I would say that Holy Grail is better for a first time viewing, but Life of Brian tends to be funnier over repeat viewings.  Both movies are simply fantastic and nothing made nowadays can come close to rivaling the all out hillarity that was Python.
I don't know how you people can not like the ending to Holy Grail, in my oppinion it fit in so perfectly with the rest of the movie. You guys love other odd quips of the same sort such as the holy hand grenade, the animator suddenly dying to kill off a monster, the black knight and cocconuts being used in place of horses yet a completely random and unexpected ending doesn't sit right with you? That just seems strange to me. Personally, I think having a big budget, flashy fight scene at the end would've made the movie seem stale and unoriginal, it simply wouldn't fall in with the style of the rest of the film. They needed to put in something that would make audiences say ""What the hell was that all about?"" at the end at that's exactly what they did.While the members of Python have now gone their seperate ways you can still see the same type of wackiness coming up in newer movies they've contributed to. I would say the most prominant would be the films Terry Gilliam has directed, most of them aren't meant to be funny but the aching attention to detail he puts into his strange, chaotic sets will often remind you of something out of Python. The best examples would be Brazil and to a lesser extent Twelve Monkeys, both strange, fantastic movies, even though they're not particularly funny.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
283,tizzi22,"Funny movie, great for party conversation...er, impersonations",10,15 January 2001,"I rolled when I watched this movie.  I thought they meant it to end like it did (of course, most of us know that it ended the way it did because they ran out of money and needed easy and quick closure).  I remains to this day one of the funniest movies I have ever seen and have wanted to see over and over again.  And if you are in college and have never seen it, expect strange looks from your inability to quote lines from the movie (a little cheat for you, if it comes up in discussion and you want to add something in, just say, ""Ni!"" pronounced nee).  You know how I really realized how cool this film was?  I studied in the Loire region (in France) my sophomore year of college.  One of our earlier group excursions was to a medieval castle called Chinon.  As we climbed up the tower and reached the lookout point someone from my group whispered, ""Fetchez la vache!""  From that point until we left that part of the castle we were quoting the French people (""Why else would I have the crazy accent?"") from the movie.  That's cool.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
284,I_am_Jacks_Revenge,You're crazy not to like it!,10,14 August 2007,"This is how 6 guys can become the majority of characters in a movie about King Arthur and royally SCREW IT UP COMPLETELY!!!! This one of the funniest movies that I have seen in my life!! Disagree if you may, but these guys were the kings of comedy. Graham Chapman (RIP), John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin were the geniuses behind it all.King Arthur (Graham Chapman) and his trusty companion Patsy are trotting in the fog..... with coconut halves to impersonate horse clomping. What the f**k? I couldn't help but laugh. When they reach a castle, two guards are asking how they got coconut halves. ""We found them."" ""What? In Mercia? The coconuts are tropical."" ""What do you mean?"" ""This is a sub-temperate zone."" ""So? It could be carried."" I'm not going to keep going on because I know that I will not stop. Along the way, King Arthur and Patsy come along the Black Knight, who is fighting a green knight, and eventually stabs a sword into the green knight's head. It's really fake. King Arthur tries to pass him, but must fight the Black Knight. He ends up cutting his arm off. ""You fight well, good Sir knight, but the fight is mine."" ""You sissy."" ""What? You're arm is off!"" ""No it isn't."" ""Look!!"" ""Just a scratch."" He cuts the other arm. ""'Tis a flesh wound."" Then he cuts a leg off. Arthur says, ""What're you gonna do, bleed on me?"" He ends up cutting his other leg off as well. ""Alright,"" Arthur says, ""we'll call it a draw."" It's really hilarious to watch that scene, especially the ""'tis a flesh wound"" part. Over the course of the movie, Arthur comes across people who like to burn witches because they look like one. He gathers followers who are asked to come to Camelot, but then the silly song comes up, and then... ""You know, on second thought, let's not go to Camelot. It is a silly place."" They are asked by God to seek the Holy Grail; also, to stop shielding their eyes. ""It's like those miserable Psalms. They're so depressing."" They would find many adventures along the way, including a castle full of sexy girls, a three-headed knight, a killer monster, a seemingly harmless creature, and parts that will make you think ""What the hell were these guys thinking??!!!!""This is a great Monty Python movie. Watch it and you'll see why. Or you can disagree with me completely and think that it's a total waste of time. Your pick.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

They seem to be just a bunch of sketches thrown together using the same core of characters.They do have funny bits, but I think I prefer the tv show.Anyway, this movie is short, thankfully.

Don't believe me? I doubt anyone is unfamiliar with the line ""Tis but a scratch"". That scene with the Black Knight is one of the funniest and original scenes in movie history.If you haven't seen it yet, what the hell? Go out and rent it now.

Not all is fun, but you already knew that didn't you?Well, John Cleese, Eric Idle, Graham Chapman, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam and the rest in the Monty Python gang is my all-time favorite tv-program of all times, and in their first ""real"" movie they score.There isn't much use of telling the plot, since youv'e already read it (They embark on a quest for the holy grail), yeah, that's it! But what they encounter on their way towards the grail is a pure hoot.No one will forget the magically scenes; The Black Knight, The Killer Rabbit, The Bridgekeeper, The Knight's Who Say 'Ni', The Sorceror, Sir Lancelot's Brave Rescue, The Castle Of Horny Ladies, The Castle Of The Frenchmen and The Giant.Let me sum it up: SEE IT! ***** of *****",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

293,davidking,"One day, lad, all this will be yours! What, the curtains?",10,22 November 2001,"This is one of the most non-sensical movies of all time.  I greatly enjoyed the film from its opening credits to the really absurd anti-climatic ending. The movie is so enjoyable I have found great pleasure in memorizing lines from the film.I think the best sequence in the film is most certainly ""The Tale of Sir Launcelot"", a scene which has absolutely nothing to do with the story, but has dialog that brings some of the best laughs.  Another real favorite is the ""Bridge of Death"", a scene I have almost memorized in its entirety.Other highlights in the film, in my opinion, include the opening scene, ""Bring out your Dead"", ""The Black Knight"", the witch scene, ""Camalot"", ""The Tale of Sir Robin"", ""The Tale of Sir Galahad"", ""Tim the Enchanter"", ""The Killer Rabbit"", and the animator's fatal heart attack (""Death on an Animator""?).  Still, I won't say the rest of the film is less enjoyable, just a little less memorable than the rest.The best thing about the film is learning about how bad some of the filming conditions were, or how difficult a time the Monty Python troupe had in making it.  The actors really had a difficult time in making the movie, and yet they still gave their best effort to make the film humorous.

You are obviously not intelligent enough to see that you're not SUPPOSED to understand it. That is what makes it so funny. Completely random, irrelevant humor (e.g. the Knights Who Say 'Nee!', the castle Arrrgh, the political-minded peasants) makes this film stand above all others in terms of funniness.My God, how can a single group of men be this funny?

The ending is a bit pathetic (but origional) and there are a couple sequences that are basically filler but when combined with the Black Knight Sequence, the Dead Cart scene, the whole swallows/coconuts thing and the amusing credits, this movie is great. I personally think it is a worthwhile film because the average movie budget in the UK is sixpence and the entire continent has only four fields of culture: 1)Douglas Adams (Deceased :( ) 2)Terry Pratchett 3)Monty Python 4)Ozzy OsbourneWorking in these conditions makes The Holy Grail a  Masterpiece.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

Even though conservative critics might rather rate negatively a movie featuring coconuts instead of horses, the standard movie-lover will find this as a hilarious chill out.I haven't watched the other Monty Python movies, but no film I have seen compares to this. Scary Movies may come to mind, but not even the first two are comparable to Monty Python's language and situation gags.The story is basically that of King Arthur and three of the knights of the round table going through numerous adventures as they seek for the cup from which Jesus drank on the Last Supper.It is to jot down that this movie contains a lot of language and British humor, which may not be suitable to the audience which finds laughter on stupid falls or hits in the head or other parts.As a conclusion, I think that although you do not end up liking the movie, you still would appreciate to have seen how a movie with low budget is exactly done.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

311,Uberhamster,"Absurd humor, or the hard life of king Arthur",10,30 May 2004,"Humor on an absurd, abstract, and partly cult, level set in the the Middle Ages. Monty Python's first film gives birth to the famous Knights of Ni, the Castle of Aargh, the Capital of Assyria, Just a fleshwound and other unforgettable little masterpieces. Some less famous but equally hilarious jokes only wait to be discovered on second viewing. Filmed without any substantial budget, Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail features a number of jokes that were born out of poverty, the most famous are the 'horses'. Perhaps(?) unintended but also comical is the dialogue alternating between lines as in medieval literature and normal talk. The basic ingredients are quests, knights, castles, dangers, tests and temptations, animation, and a little bit of witchcraft. Less unorthodox and anachronistic ingredients are of course also present. A few jokes may seem vaguely reminiscent of obscure earlier work, for those who know the Flying Circus series by heart. Basically the stories narrate the hard times for King Arthur as the England of that time with it many strange inhabitants doesn't seem fit for his rule. First he has to find the knights for his round table. Next God grants him the Quest, but it is far from easy and the knights split up. Following some ridiculous separate adventures, their paths come together once again when they find an enchanter who has a lead to the grail. Nothing turns out the way you'd expect, and even after the dangerous bridge of death Arthur is not free of trouble. The ending is rather odd and once again mainly due to lack of money. Made in 1975, its appeal still has not diminished even though the idea behind the humor has been copied many times (with less success). Given the poor circumstances in which the Monty Python team made this film (complete lack of funds, no experience in movie industry, use national castles denied shortly before filming began, a drunk Graham Chapman), I for one regard it as their best film. Note - many interesting facts about the jokes, the locations, the cast and such are too detailed to list here, but can be found on the DVD.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

Perhaps one of the funniest movies of all time.  Yes, there is a British sense of humor, but unlike many English movies and understanding of British humor is not entirely required. There is physical comedy, musical comedy ""It's only a model"". And of course it wouldn't be a Monty Python movie without ripping ""society"" a new butt.  ""Oh, King, eh?  Very nice.""

We embark on a quest with King Arthur and his Knights to find the legendary Holy Grail. What follows is a hilarious adventure involving spoilt stuck-up princes, gory sword fights, wild untamed monsters and shrubberies.Is the plot the most complicated and thought provoking you'll ever see? No. Do the special effects blow you away? No. Could a dead fly have written a better plot line? Yes. So you're probably thinking, why am I giving this ten stars after typing all that? It's because the special effects are low-budget because they're meant to be - I mean, they could have used at least one horse. But it wouldn't be as funny if they did. The plot is so bizarre and ridiculous because if it wasn't, it wouldn't make Monty Python and The Holy Grail the masterpiece it is today. Not many British films get so much attention as this one. And boy, it deserves it. If you find this unfunny, there must be something wrong with your brain.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
317,bibleman24,Not Very Good...,5,20 September 2011,"I couldn't wait to see this movie when I bought it. I had heard that it was hilarious and really good. Alas - I don't think this is a correct analysis.For starters, it's just nowhere near as entertaining as it promises. Bits where the directors have sought to make people laugh are often long and drawn out and don't get much more than a smile or quick chuckle. The film certainly is not 'hilarious' - at all. Some moments are definitely funny (the son who likes to sing, for example) - but for what it promises in terms of humour, it fails miserably.Secondly, the film is totally dated. 'Jaws', 'The Matrix' and 'Terminator 2' will never get old. But this film has not stood the test of time. I honestly think that most young people who watch this today will get bored pretty quickly.Thirdly, the plot is rubbish. I don't know how such a mindless story- line entertains people. It's boring; when I watched it, I felt like I was wasting time. That's really bad news.Fourthy, where is the music? If there is any, it's totally unmemorable.One or two things are positive. The acting is pretty good, especially considering the script is so poor. Also, some of the ideas are interesting and stick in your mind long after you've seen the film. For example, the knights who say 'Nee'; the rabbit; and the time when one of the men is teaching the common people about how you learn whether someone is a witch.But overall, the film is average - if that. I think it's only because it's a Monty Python film that people watch it. I am baffled that it has reached No.75 on IMDb's top 250 best films ever. What on earth went wrong here?So aside from what many people seem to think about this film, this Monty Python effort really is not very good. (In fact, I remember once watching some of 'The Life of Brian', but that too was so boring. I never finished watching it.) I've watched loads of films better than 'The Holy Grail'. And I think what I've written is just based upon a sound understanding of what makes a good film. I don't see how any faithful film-critic can think much of this film. Very disappointing, especially from such a talented group of men as the Monty Python crew. I mean, seriously, I'll give you my final plea: you've got a choice of the top 10 films of all time. Are you really going to pick this? There was a reason it didn't get a single Oscar Nomination...",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

Telling the story of King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table, they set off on a quest to find the holy grail while on the way confronting the Black Knight who won't give in, The Killer Rabbit, The Black Beast Of AAARRRGGGHH, and others.There are some very funny moments like the french taunting (silly knn-ig-its!!), the Castle Anthrax and Sir Bedeviere's theory on the Earth being Banana shaped!

I really think it's the funniest film ever made, with the Mel Brooks flicks running a close second. It does a send-up of a lot of things -- academia, medieval legends, historical events. Amazing how those six guys do all those parts. The two best scenes were the fight between Arthur and the Black Knight (""You yellow b**tard! Come back here and get what's coming to you. I'll bite your legs off."") and the clash with the French (""I wave my private parts at your auntie, you cheesy-loving second hand electric donkey-bottom biters.""). The other Python flicks (except for the abysmally awful ""Jabberwocky"") were good, but fell way short of ""Holy Grail."" Now I've just learned ""Holy Grail"" is being made into a musical. Oh, man.

I am sorry to say but there are people that do dislike the humor... but they are the ones that you see putting down the good and overrating the bad now aren't they(click on their names to see what they hate or like). But I find this humor just right. Not to dry like 'Napolean Dynamite'(which I HATED!), not to dark like 'Beeteljuice', and not to crazy(and it is still crazy)like 'Airplane!'. And the fact that it is a combo of all of these genres of comedy and more is why it deserved to be up here as #49. Plus taking something as sacred and holy such as the last cup Jesus drank of and spoofing it all as much as all the knights tales made is hilarious. And most the humor is that type of humor that you just can't but at least giggle at. The silliness is amazing.*Spoilers*The Knights that say ""NI""(pronounced like ""knee""). I mean honestly... thats just crazy. Then the most famous part, the black knight battle, in which the black knight continues to fight until he has no more limbs. And yet he still wishes to fight. And then there is my personal favorite, the killer rabbit whoms't rips faces off.*End of spoilers*There is so much more to laugh at in this movie that allows it to be on this list.

It's a shame that the Python team never was able to make another movie like this one (though ""life of brian"" is pretty good); i guess this movie surpassed even their own shrubberies....
what IS a shame, is that - when the movie is aired on TV - they often show a version where the first part is cut out; the *REAL* movie starts with a commercial for a japanese restaurant. But that's just a 2 minute intro.In some comments it is clear that the humor is not understood by some people. Well, politicians are not understood be even more people. My point ? that Sir Robin, Robert the Shrubber and the guard of Herbert is the same guy !!! but then again the two level effect between the shrubberies does make up for that....One more thing: the music - especially at the end - is brilliant, adding to the professionality, but that's undone a little by some scenery. One of the best laughs up to this date for me is the bridge the Black Knight holds.

Anyway, back to the flick at hand... It takes vast intelligence to intermix silliness and intellect, the way Monty Python has. You watch the thing, know that it's ridiculous, but at the same time understand how much intelligence it took to pull it off.

This is a rare occasion where something can be so stupid that it's funny, with the addition of feeling you got your money's worth at the end. Examples of failures would be anchorman, austin powers, scary movie etc. The gore and clichés of three headed, and goofy ""NI!"" yelling knights are what give this movie discreet beauty.Did I mention that the acting is also very good for a movie of this sort. All of the main characters, as they do in the series, take on numerous characters, all of whom are well established and each have their quirks about them. This was a well written, well thought out, and perfectly directed, low budget comedy. The funniest of any monty python film, and amongst the top comedies of all time.

This movie isn't great, it doesn't have great acting, great cinematography, a great message, or a great story. But it is so fun, so enjoyable, so idiotic, that you are gonna find yourself loving this movie.

Patsy disappeared right after the final Knights of Ni scene, Tim vanished after the Killer Rabbit was destroyed and Lancelot made it across the Bridge of Death, was arrested then he was gone (we should have seen him in the police seen at the end).

341,joaoantonioasodias,New perspective,10,16 July 2018,"The saga of King Arthur and his knight companions is one the best know mythic cycles around the world. The Arthurian Cycle is for many people the traditional image of the chivalry world, where proud knight would go around the land seeking to defend the righteous, slay some dragons and save beautiful maidens in the name of a good/righteous king. But the most famous quest of this cycle is perhaps also one of the most unknown, as the greatest quest that the Round Table took part was the quest for the Holy Grail, one of the three holy relics of Christianity. Is a serious tale that speaks a lot of bravery, disappointment and mostly about Christian virtue and the worth of a pious life.
On this masterpiece of movie, we see a complete new view of this classical world purely with one mentality: being hilarious! From small jokes only understood by fans of the cycle to generic jokes that will make you fall on your behinds laughing. Perhaps one of the most striking features for me is the fact that it was not made by foreigner, but by the greatest British comedian group (Monty Python).

Just one dumb attempt at humor after another, nothing really connected, and almost none of it was very funny.  A great deal of it was absurd and bizarre but nothing that really made me laugh at all (except maybe for the monks hitting themselves in the head with a board and the bit about the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch).

345,hhhrahulhhh,Haha!! Reminded me of what comedy is all about,8,29 December 2013,"This is why I love British productions of comedy. I rated this title an 8 out of 10 only because I am watching it in 2013. Hats off to those who envisioned and created it in 1975.Long I had read about Monty Python being the pioneer in the new era of comedy, I had to see to believe it. I am sure my lips were kept straight only because of watching so much of Blackadder, Robin Hood: Men in Tights and the variety of dead pan comedy available today on the web (and I think one episode of The Flying Circus). If I were a green viewer, the skits would have tickled my comedic senses to go for a full 10 on 10.The satire of society in general, the situational comedy, portrayal of romanticism, gallantry and heroism in the middle ages is from an angle so twisted and deadpan that in my view this movie has really set the standards for the best works which came after it. I loved the way in which the movie went a little bit after each of politics, religion, English culture, mythology, legends and even the art of movie making itself.About the movie scenes, I hope I am not putting in any spoilers but I am checking the box above just in case you don't want any bit of information before watching it. I kept on giggling from the subtitles (Please don't skip them..) to the first scene with King Arthur & his horse. I don't know whether it was creative or just a way to reduce the animal cast budget to a single rabbit and some dead cows, but it was brilliant. Being a nerd I couldn't stop laughing whenever the weight velocity ratios of unladen swallows came up. I could never have enough of such ""nerdy"" references. Another aspect I love about creative comedy is when sketches are cruelly and abruptly terminated. It leaves the mind's thirst unquenched and so much is left to the imagination. I couldn't have doubted that the Monty Python series of all would utilise this concept to genius effect. (Though I was throughout the movie waiting for a foot to drop, disappointed there.)I believe that the enjoyment that you will get from this movie really depends on your tastes as a viewer and your appetite for dry, satirical comedy involving mundane idiocy and simpleton characters. Personally I call it art.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
346,kagrisier,"Without a doubt, the funniest film I've ever seen.",10,24 February 2007,"There's a huge difference between American humor and British humor. American humor is the fart and burp joke while British humor is the arguing over a pointless subject joke. Python is British. Therefore, there will be many people who won't ""get"" this film. But those who do will have the comedy experience of a lifetime.With a plot that can be summed up in 10 words (King Arthur and his knights search for the Holy Grail), this film isn't deep or emotional. However, the dialogue is so funny and the acting so excellent that the film feels like an epic-minus a large budget. The budget is the only problem with the film, and it doesn't detract much. You might notice the crummy special effects, but there aren't many, so it doesn't matter. Other than that, the film is beautifully shot. The epic Scottish landscapes are perfect for the film. The medieval costumes and sets are also great, but it's the acting which makes this film a true classic.All the Pythons are fantastic. Graham Chapman is hilarious as the straight-faced King Arthur, along with a few other roles. His straight man occasionally delves into the ""silly"", which makes for an excellent performance. John Cleese, my personal favorite of the Pythons, is funny as the French Taunter and- my favorite role in the film- the eccentric, pyromaniac, spitting Tim the Enchanter! Michael Palin has one of the funniest moments in the film while in the Castle Anthrax with about 20 young girls. Terry Jones is a riot as the timid Prince Herbert, who sounds like Michael Crawford and yearns to escape his castle with Sir Lancelot. Eric Idle is very funny as Sir Robin, the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir Lancelot, who frequently wets his pants and runs away. And Terry Gilliam, besides providing beautiful animation sequences, has a variety of funny small roles, including the ""horse"" Patsy.Not a scene goes by that isn't funny. The humor is rich, including Knights who Say Ni, Killer Rabbits, politically active peasants, a knight who refuses to give up even when he's lost all his limbs, and a group of minstrels who sing of ""bravely running away"". The film is the funniest film I've ever seen. Shouldn't that be good enough for you?",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

While ""Meaning of Life"" has always been my favorite, my preference for it isn't so high after being able to fully appreciate this movie.The classic Arthurian legend is embedded in our culture moreso than one would think. I both realized this when watching this movie, and realized how classic myth and history is basically set-up for any Python comedic twist.The folk-singing Sir Robin crew and the virtuous Gallahad scenes are classic, as well as the brief/blunt God the Father (or is it Jesus) opening up the slide-doors cloud to give Arthur his mission.It is hard not to laugh at anything Python, and ""Holy Grail"" definitely provides them.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

It also gives out laughable jokes that became iconic even to this day.From the beginning's credit sequence to the argument about swallows, the viewers already get a roller-coaster trip of hilarious gags and detailed cinematography.If the Python crew is doing good at something, its doing hilarious nonsense comedy. I'm amazed that the crew can still bust out a few laughs even until today 'cause I just couldn't stop laughing at almost every scene in the movie!

But sorry to say the movie was hopeless. There was no humour in this movie. The entire ambiance in the movie looked gloomy. The attempts at humours were pathetic and even a 4 year old kid would write better comic scenes. It was the most boring movie I have ever watched. What were these people thinking when they made this movie ? This definitely not the 'epitome' of English comedy. Only thing it was good at was that I had a nice nap when I was half way though the movie. The remaining half gave me a nice sleep in the night. Don't even bring its DVD on rent.If I had to describe this movie in one word it would be 'nonsense'. (I had a stronger word but I refrained myself from saying it),Monty Python and the Holy Grail

This is going on the second Terry Gilliam movie I have seen following Time Bandits (1981), both of which made absolutely no sense and nothing nostalgic.

The Python boys were at their best in this film. The jokes are rattled off one by one and they get funnier as they go.

357,isaackamp,Unebelievable,10,6 April 2008,"This film is a standard parody at the outset. But what makes it different is not only its constantly funny parody/farce, is that most all of the film is funny. Most comedies will take a few minutes to set up a joke, for the sake of advancing the plot. MPTHG brilliantly integrates funny into the setup as well, making no dull moments at all. This is the type of humor that Monty Python pioneered, the kind of comedy that makes you wonder if the writers went over every inch of script with a fine-toothed comb mumbling ""how can i put a good joke in here..."". Basically, see this movie. It is the basis for many, many parodies and social satires, (the revered English comedy Blackadder uses some technique similar to it) and is pretty much the Citizen Kane of comedy.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
358,wozzasfc,Holy Grail,6,14 June 2005,"I personally prefer The Life of Brian to this movie from the Python lads, but it is still very funny and typically Python slapstick comedy.The legend of King Arthur is a story we have all endured in one form or another, but this take on events devised by Graham Chapman is pure genius. If you are a fan of Python's Flying Circus, The Meaning of Life or The Life of Brian, this movie is for you.There are the memorable characters such as The Nights Who Say Nee, and The French Guard. Not to mention the Killer Rabbit which was very under-estimated by Arthur's men at their own peril.As I stated before, a fan of Python work will enjoy this, others may find it a little too over-the-top, and though may be amused, may also be just as inclined to turn it off. On a personal note, I think John Cleese is absolutely amazing once again in this adventure.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

360,mobdick69,A Masterpiece For All Time,10,2 January 2001,"What to say about the funniest movie of all time?Its a shame they don't show this in school.Monty Python manages to score a comic coup de'tat with their first movie. ""Grail"" easily puts all other comic movies before and after against a scale few can live up to.  Its stupid subplots created an environment suitable for other gems like Caddyshack and There's Something About Mary.
This movie is so good, its hard to describe without simply posting the script.  All you have to do is put two people who've seen this movie together and you'll hear 45 minutes of dialogue from it.

361,gomi28,I hated this the first time too.,9,8 May 2002,"I saw there were a couple people that watched this once and hated it. When I first watched it, I was about 17.  My younger brother was watching it and just cracking up.  I thought it was boring and never even bothered to watch all of it.  What is weird is that I even liked the flying circus and watched it all the time, but this movie was just, ""BLAH""A few years later I was in a remote area for a year (Yosemite National Park) and there was nothing to do at night except watch TV if you had one.  One night the local bar had a ""Locals Only"" party and the Holy Grail was the feature. ""DAMN, not that again"" I thought.  But I got there and everyone was hysterical and reciting the entire movie.  I think something I missed before finaly stuck and I realized what a great movie this was.  If you saw it once and hated it, find a bunch of friends that liked it, get a big party going and have a blast. That might show you what it is all about.  Although it is good when you are alone, it is soo much better with friends.Yes I do now own this on VHS along with other python movies but when I got a DVD player, this was the one I bought.  Meaning of life, Life of Brian, ""...and now for something completely different..."" are also good but Holy Grail just has something there that the others are missing.

This is my favourite Python film, with every character hilarious and wonderfully wacky. Each Python takes on a number of parts, with Palin carrying away the palm with no less than ten roles, and each is brilliant. King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table abandon Camelot (which is a very silly place, don't you know) in favour of the Quest for the Holy Grail, as ordered by God, who parts the clouds especially to have a chat. Along the way, the Knights - including Lancelot the Brave, Galahad the Pure, and Robin, the not-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot - encounter a number of ingenious and, indeed, silly, obstacles. The Python team are responsible for some of the most original and ingenious comedy ever seen on television or the big screen. This film is amongst their absolutely best work.

Monsters and coconuts.I would recommend this movie to anyone who's still in touch with the child within.

It has many great scenes in it, but my favorite has to be the sequence at swamp castle. It also has several great moments of absurdity in it, such as ""The Knights who say 'Ni'"". The members of Monty Python all do great jobs in the film, with Graham Chapman's performance as King Arthur, Michael Palin's performances as Sir Galahad, the head of the Knights Who Say Ni, and as the King of Swamp Castle, John Cleese's performance as Sir Lancelot, Eric Idle's performance as ""Sir Robin the Not-Quite-as-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot"", Terry Jones' performance as Sir Bedevere and Terry Gilliam's animation (as well as his performance as Prince Herbert).",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

I've watched this move 3 times, and I still laugh at the jokes. They give King Arthur a great comedic value, and include many funny short scenes, with no other purpose but to make the viewer laugh.

But instead of a story about knights and princesses, I got one of the most amazing comedies I had ever watched. There are so many jokes from this movie that stuck with me after just one sitting, and I have watched it many times since. The unique, absurd humor of Monty Python might not be for everyone, but it instantly became a favorite for me, and I rented many more works from them after watching the Holy Grail. An epic movie, that every person must watch once in their lives, even if it is just to figure out whether they want to delve deeper in the crazy world of Monty Python.Also, on the DVD release extras, there was a song from the movie reenacted with LEGO figurines, and a 'documentary' for coconuts, make sure to look for those when you pick up the movie!",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

I had the distinct pleasure of watching ""Grail"" with a friend who absolutely hated every minute of it, and this, of course, made all the jokes that much funnier for me.

It's one of those things that leaves you rolling on the floor with your sides splitting. It was made in the 1970s by the same group that made the Monty Python Flying Circus television series. The ""King Arthur"" plot isn't all that important, all things considered. It's mainly an excuse for a string of gags which seem to get more ridiculous as time passes on. The King and his Knights of the Round Table somehow can't get any horses, so they find some coconuts and clap them together to imitate the sound of trotting hooves as they skip along through the countryside. The group encounters many adventures and misadventures, including some oversexed ladies at Castle Anthrax, a Black Knight who won't admit defeat even when he's lost his arms and legs, a killer rabbit, a Frenchman who hurls insults at them (among other things), and the Knights Who Say Ni.

The breaking of the 4th wall was humorous and added a new aspect to the adventure.
Although the film had a low budget, the cinematography was not bad. The blend of live-action and animation added to the comedic factor. The acting is entertaining as the cast gets to goof off on screen. The music in the film is easily forgettable, but it fits the era the story is primarily set in.

Sure, the self-abusive monks are quite funny, but people really did that.

And after each viewing, take a few moments to write a short letter to each of the remaining members of the Python troupe, thanking them for such an absurdly funny movie and encouraging them to get together for a reunion and possibly make a few more movies.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

The amount of times I have spent in the pub regurgitating the Black Knight scene or the Knights who say 'Ni' is uncountable Yes it is true to the original Malory and Victorian tales, only by implication, but then it is a comedy and like ever they have used it to provide farcical, slapstick and satire to an unbelievable high standard. I was in tears in many places the first time I watched it and still find myself giggling, many times later at the key scenes.This is a total gem, along with the other great Python Production 'The Life of Brian' , If you haven't seen it, watch it and if you don't like it then you either have had your humour gland removed or I am deluded.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
397,thirstypony,An Instant Classic: The Best Way to Humor anyone...even your boss,9,16 March 2013,"I absolutely loved this movie! It's got everything in it a comedian would be looking for. There is never a dull moment in ""The Holy Grail"". Graham Chapman plays a superb role as King Arthur alongside other great actors who flowed with the energy and excellent humor of this memorable film. Even though it is a ridiculous, nonsensical film (the killer rabbit, the crazy starting credits, and the ending should throw a thumbs up for that), it has a unique style that always get you laughing. Some of my favorite scenes in this movie (there are many) have to be the Bridge of Death scene (WHAT is your favorite color...WHAT is the capitol of Syria?), the killer rabbit, and the guards who have a hard time figuring out if they should leave the room or not (so we stay here and guard the prisoner...until you leave...and then we follow you. But wait, do we take him with us?). The comic geniuses behind this film deserve a lot of credit for putting in moments in the film that were not meant to be taken seriously or require much thought but just to make you sit back and think ""Man, what are they going to do next? This is hilarious!"". It's just a pure fun,entertaining comedy film that anyone of any age should enjoy. Too bad a lot of comedic films these days can't be like this one. Most have submitted to the layout standards of Hollywood films and some,incredibly ironic, don't know how to be funny or take themselves too seriously. Take a page out of Monty Python's play book. Any movie that features a gang of misfits embarking on a crazy journey that ends up nowhere(except in jail, I suppose) has got to be a real winner. Ni!",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

It is comedy that will satisfy the palate of those who appreciate a more enduring and smart humor, one which you can chew on the gristles and find new flavors as you go along. There are notes of philosphy, religion, and pure mockery of the absurdity of how domineering the two have become over the human psyche. The scenes are funny, but they are intelligent and meaningful.

Eric Idle, adding his own twist of magnificence, Graham Chapman once again assuming the lead role of the movie, John Cleese is perfect as the French Knight, Terry Gilliam is wonderful as Sir Bederive and of course Terry Jones as Patsy.

Being in college, a group of my friends all wanted to watch it so I decided to join, excited to finally see this movie for which I've heard so much praise. I could see how people find the movie funny but I could not get into it. I kept wanting to leave but was determined to see it through to its end... and actually, I'm glad I did because the ending ""credits"" where it's several minutes of music playing to a black screen was the only thing that made me laugh from the movie. I respect the movie because it so widely loved so I'm not trying to bash it, yet I definitely think, as with any sort of humor, it is not for everyone. There are countless types of humor: dry, sarcastic, physical, nonsense, political etc. and everyone has their own taste as to which they prefer. With a movie like Monty Python, which has a very certain type of humor attached to it, there are bound to be those who dislike it. I only leave this comment to let those of you who have not yet seen the movie hear a ""different"" sort of opinion, as nearly all of the comments here highly praise the movie.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

Stands test of time.",10,21 November 2013,"The Holy Grail is not only the epitome of a funny, silly movie but also it actually stands the test of time. Maybe it was made in 1975 but even today people regularly quote from it and use scene clips from it to express points and relevant humor. Besides, how could a movie based on a time period centuries earlier ever become obsolete? The movie opens up with my favorite scene where a peasant with chutzpah, who seems to know too much about politics for a peasant, argues with a king and points out details the king finds valid but very inconvenient. It then goes on and on making fun of various customs of the day-actually mocking many true practices of the time (just as other Python movies do). You can tell the movie was written with a decent grasp of education in history even though it is low budget in implementing it. But it does not stop there-the movie isn't satisfied with only making fun of history so it proceeds to make fun of itself.I won't spoil it for you although you likely already saw it. But let me just say this: if you want to make it to the end, forget any sense of logic or reason before you watch it and study all you can about European and African swallows and cocoanuts.

Somedays I'll sit around reciting every line during work.  I usually get everyone roaring.  I just love the witch scene ( build a bridge out of her ) and the guards in the castle are hilarious ( Oh, I thought you were talking about him )  There is simply no comparison to this movie.  You have to watch it many times to get the all of the humour.  The Holy Hangrenade is really good (thou shalt count to three, and the number of the counting shall be three)  and the killer rabbit is a riot ( We've lost Boris, Gawain, and Hector, that's five, three sir! ) Anyway, go watch this movie with your friends and laugh your head off.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

Every time I watch this movie, I laugh until tears stream down my face.  Truly no other comedy has ever been able to do that for me.Incredible performances by the crew of Monty Python add to the wonderful humor of the entire thing, from the very first scene until the end.There is not one aspect of this movie that is not hilarious -- the ""horses,"" coconuts, the stupidity of the nights, the intelligent peasants who work at nothing, the satire of the Salem Witch Hunts, the wonderful cartoons, and who can ever forget the fearsome Knights Who Say Ni?  TIM the Enchanter, the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, the Great Beastly Rabbit?Anyone who can sit through this movie with a straight face must be blind deaf and dumb.  There is not one part in this film that will not inspire laughter.The only downer in this movie is the ending that, though funny, leaves you with more of a taste of disappointment than of hilarity.I gave this movie a 10 out of 10.

406,joeliuscaesar,Not just non-stop hilarity,10,29 December 2001,"WARNING `Spoilers'Probably the greatest comedy of all-time (up there with my personal favorites of Annie Hall and Dr. Strangelove) not simply because I have to stop it ten minutes into the film because my abdominals are aching from laughter. No, its because like all good movies it offers more than just two hours of entertainment. It is simple yet complex, stupid but quite intelligent. Let me elaborate: like all Monty Python production their comedy is always abstract and willing to push the boundaries of the absurd.The premise is simple: it is satire of the Arthurian legend where King Arthur bands together the knights of the round table to go on a quest to seek the holy grail. We are therefore introduced to a range of unlikely looking knights who each encounter various obstacles on their quest.The absurdity begins automatically when we see that the knights do not actually ride horses but only skip along holding an imaginary reign with the squire behind the knight making the noise of horses hooves with coconut shells! I mean come on, only the insane Monty Python can come up with something so silly. However, the absurdity does no end there, others include the knights who say Ni, the killer rabbit, and what is with that scene where the guards keep seeing repeats of a charging knight? These are just some of the crazy examples.It becomes complex when it enters the multi-spatial realm. For example, when they enter the cave and encounter the beast it turns to animation, but then the animator dies and we see vision of the actual animator have a heart attack. What's even more complex is the ending where a the host of a 20th century documentary is killed by one of the knights, then the cops arrest King Arthur, what the ... ? This mix of fiction, myth, and reality is very hard to mould together and is done superbly. This can only be done in an intelligent way, and is helped by the fact they are using a comedy genre.All in all a fantastic comedy.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

How wrong I was.Everyone talks about Life of Brian being the funniest film of all time by a country mile; however I laughed a lot more at this film and I think that the controversy of Life of Brian means that not many people notice how funny and brilliant this film is. I think that Life of Brian is cleverer and there probably are more funny bits in Life of Brian, but I only laugh at the seriously funny things and I very rarely laugh more than once at sitcoms. So Holy Grail has more seriously funny bits in it and in virtually every scene had me in stitches.See this film because Monty Python is the funniest thing ever, as well as Fawlty Towers (but Fawlty Towers was written by Python John Cleese).",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

In fact I hate them a lot for bashing on Christianity and thinking its okay for man to dress in drag. However, after viewing this movie, I saw the potential in their humor. In this movie they play King Arthur and his knights, which I like. Sword and sorcery will definitely grab my attention in a movie. But most importantly for this movie it was the humor. There was a lot of funny things like a bunny attacking and killing the knights, a sword fight in which the black knight loses his arms and legs and continues to fight. I love gore in comedies. Always works for me. This movie made me see that Monty Python really can be funny and not just an offensive insult on the establishment.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

Nah, that one's easy, you just go see Roger the Shrubber. Perhaps ""If witches are indeed made of wood (which would explain their buoyancy) then why can't we make a bridge out of them?"" Ah geez I just don't know what the real question is! Seriously this is one of the best comedies of all time! The Python's are masters of whacky slapstick, silly one-liners, and tongue in cheek play and this film showcases that as well as any of the better episodes of ""Flying Circus"" (although I feel Flying Circus is a more rewarding body of work in terms of originality and scope).

There was not a big audience and those that were there, didn't really seem to be ""getting"" it. On the other hand, I was quite literally rolling in the aisle as I fell out of my seat laughing. (And to fall onto one of the filthiest floor in creation, you have to be REALLY laughing hard.)One reviewer -- one of the VERY few low scorers -- thought that the humor was ""dated"" and that humor has ""evolved"". Really? A casual skimming of TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, etc., turns up a descent into the Idiocratic ""Ow... my balls"", Benny Hill-like silliness, or obtuse locker room sexual innuendo, to enumerate just a few. The funniest of today's comics are all derivative of Python in some respect.Python's jokes are seldom just ""funny"" -- that's just the visible tip of the knife. I've come to think of this (and Life of Brian) as one of the great contributions to absurdist theater -- as significant as Ionesco, Beckett, Camus. Of course, to analyze humor destroys the laugh -- it's the quantum mechanics of lunacy. However, in the Holy Grail, the philosophy is there for the taking.

The problem with most comedies is that, no matter how amusing they may be on the first viewing, on subsequent showings they rapidly pall. Not so with the Holy Grail. I find that I get just as much fun out of anticipating each classic scene as I do out of watching it. I've lost count of the number of times I've seen this movie. If you possess any sense of humour at all you owe it to yourself to see this film at least once before you die. Oh, and the ending is NOT crap. It's perfectly in keeping with what has gone before.

I didn't even know the name of the movie at the time till I got to college and we rented it. I recognized it right away.

Almost every scene in the movie had me in stitches, and I must say the Python team certainly has set a high standard on how comedies are meant to be done.John Cleese, Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and the incomparable Graham Chapman were outstanding.

This movie has it all: violence, missing limbs, a chorus line of knights in full armor, bad french impersonators (with outraaaaageous accents!), violence towards cats, and a little sex (oral).If you like great battle scenes see BraveHeart or Episode I.  There's no great battles here.  In fact the fighters keep going while spewing blood and missing appendages without even noticing.  If you want romance then watch Casablanca.  This has a castle (The Castle Anthrax no less) with 5 score young blondes and brunettes who set out after the chaste Sir Gallahad.  If you like drama see Gone With the Wind...the most drama you'll find here is the cannibalistic consumption of some rather annoying minstrels, a terrifying construction paper monster, and an animator suffering a fatal heart attack.  If you want an intelligent flick, then rent Pi...the most intellectual stretching you'll find here is the mind taxing ""Gorge of Eternal Peril"" in which unfortunate souls must answer mind wrenching questions like ""What is your favorite color?""If you just want some good fun then this is the movie for you.

The film is essentially another movie full of back-to-back sketches but this time there's an overriding narrative i.e to obtain the holy grail. It's a clever technique which gives the movie a sense of continuity and the feel that this is a story being told rather than just being a random higgledy-piggledy collection of sketches with no connection to them.And it's damn funny in telling that story too. There are so many memorable and hilarious scenes in this film that are coming with such skill and speed that there will be very few moments in which you're sitting there stony-faced waiting for a laugh. Some of my personal favourites are the French people in the castle (which has me smiling thinking about it), The Black Knight scene (who doesn't love that scene?) and their meeting with the Killer Rabbit.The production of this film was not without it's troubles. The two directors of this film (Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones) had vastly different directing styles with Gilliam feeling that Jones would undermine the scenes with conventional camera shots and Jones getting annoyed with how much of a perfectionist Gilliam was. Also by this time Graham Chapman alcoholism was in full swing in which on some occasions Chapman couldn't remember his lines. But these behind the scenes problems manage to show no signs in the film, which is a testament to it's success. The star of the show for me really is Graham Chapman. The rest of the Python's are as good as they always are, but Chapman just nips the post for me. No one does upper-class outrage quite like Chapman did. Leading in the role as King Arthur he performs his classic role as the pompous twit that is repeatedly bamboozled and confused by the insane events surrounding him.The film also look visually stunning. The northern Scottish moors where the movie was filmed are ideal for Arthurian Britain. From the moment King Arthur arrives on screen to the ending with the fantastic looking boat the whole film's setting and direction is superbly done.In short, a very silly film full of lots of silly people doing lots of silly things, a bit like our government. Although hat's pretty much the bare essence of all the Python's fantastic work, and thus is perfectly in keeping with the rest of their comedy. The second of their films is as funnier and as clever as it gets.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

Really recommend it.It is really hilarious. The discussion and fight with the French is probably my favourite part. I've been reading here, and I should see the film again, since there are many things I don't really remember. Undoubtly is one of the best comedies there are, with the Charles Chaplin films. Specially The Gold Rush. I would give it ten stars, but just feel reticent of doing it. The rabbit part is really funny too. And the ending.

I've tried to get my hands on a copy of it, yet it's not on Neflix, Hulu, Amazon Video, or Amazon.com. Finally last night we rented a copy from a local video store. I've heard so much about how the movie is the funniest and most hilarious movies ever, and while watching it, I did laugh a whole lot. It was a good, innocent (in a good way), hilarious film.It makes use of it's $220,000 budget - which inflated to today's standards is a little less than 1 million - and it uses clever, complex, witty dialogue, skit-like scenes, and fourth-wall breaks to make it's jokes, which succeed impressively.It's unexpected randomness is also what makes it funny, the animated segments keep the movie colorful, and the outrageous things our heroes come across make the movie as unique as can be. The only other real movie that has accomplished this is Napoleon Dynamite (2004) - which has a smaller budget then The Holy Grail - it uses clever dialogue, random events, and skit-like scenes that give it a deserved cult status and make it one of the most quotable films ever.Definitely watch it. It truly lives up to the expectation, and it may take more than one viewing to catch everything, but it's an absurd, crazy thrill ride of a film and is mandatory viewing for all human beings.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

438,Jonny T,I laughed so hard my stomach hurt for three hours afterward!,9,7 January 2000,"Monty Pythons Quest For The Holy Grail is by far my favorite comedy.  I remember the first time I watched it.  I had only heard of Monty Python sort of off hand, and had never seen any of their stuff and from what I had hear they didn't sound particularly funny.  But there I was staying over at my cousin's apartment.  She wasn't there and the rent was free.  Well, in her video cabinet she had 5 or so videos.  One was Holy Grail.  So we watched it.  I did not stop laughing, EVER!  Just as you got a break from hilarity something funnier was just around the bend.  It is so extremely funny that no other comedy can compare!  The comedy ranges from silly to intelligent, but all of it is very, very good.  I originally had a problem with ending and it was a awful way to end such a great film.  I watched to the very end of that stupid music!  Anyway, well, now the ending is perfect.  I can't really say why without giving away the ending so I won't.  But the ending is historically accurate ( well sort of ).  Anyway, you will love this movie, and if the ending leaves a sour taste in your mouth, then tough, its payment for seeing such a top notch movie.  Anyway, this movies is fabulous.  A comedy of must see quality.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
439,asu_tbone,Just really funny,9,9 October 2000,"There are a lot of people who get missed by the pointed stick of Monty Python's humor.  Some complain that they overdo everything.  Others complain that their stuff doesn't go anywhere (see the ending of this movie if you don't know what I'm talking about).  Still others are just lost.  But, for those of us who like it, get it, and appreciate the things that they are trying to say, this movie makes us laugh EVERY TIME.I'm not going to say that Monty Python was trying to make a social statement with this movie.  There is really nothing in this movie that was intended for anything except to make us laugh.  They do tend to beat you over the head with a joke, such as the scene with the guards in Swamp Castle and the Knights Who Say Ni, but that's what makes everything so funny.  They do everything they can possibly do with a joke, and then hit you with something completely out of left field that confuses you, disorients you, and, in many cases, loses you completely.  Which brings me to the topic of the ending.*** IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE, DO NOT READ THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH! IT WILL SPOIL THE WHOLE THING! ***So, what's up with the ending?  During the charge towards the Castle Aargh, cops show up and arrest Bedevere and Arthur.  What the heck?!?  Like I said, completely from left field.  This is what makes a lot of people not like this movie.  It doesn't matter how hard you laughed throughout the entire movie up until this point, you don't really get a sense of completion here. Why did they do this?  To tick people off?  To see the reaction?  Because they couldn't think of a good ending?  If you know anything about Monty Python at all, then you realize that this movie could not have ended any other way.  Had Arthur and Bedevere recovered the Holy Grail, it would have been completely untrue to who Monty Python was.  They didn't make sense, their sketches didn't make sense, and, utimately, they made us laugh at ourselves because they pointed out how absurd life can be.*** NOW BACK TO THE REVIEW, SPOILER FREE FROM THIS POINT ON! ***I gave this movie a 9, mostly because there are several production mistakes and some of the scenes are a little slow.  But who cares.  You hardly notice.  If you can appreciate it for what it is instead of dwelling on what it isn't, you won't be able to stop yourself from chuckling at least a little.

Whether or not you will enjoy its a whole different story because Monty Python is an acquired taste, where it is either loved or hated by the viewer, there is almost no middle ground.

When I see all the work that goes into the hilarious and well-drawn animation, which was all done by hand---no computers of course, I can tell that this movie had a lot of thought put into it. Throughout the movie are timeless jokes that I find myself repeating over and over again.

From the start it's a scene by scene extravaganza of gags, sketches and coconuts that will leave even the most hardened heart warmed with British Cheekiness. As many of you know Monty Pythons Flying Circus was a big British hit in the late 60's and early 70's before the Python troupe made their trip into film. This is their first attempt, Holy Grail and it's their best. There's not a man upon this planet who should die without knowing of Roger the Shrubber and the Knights who say Knee. There are some questionable moral dilemmas placed before Arthur and his Knights on their quest for the Grail.

Known for abruptly ending TV skits mid-stream with the segue ""And now for something completely different"" -- due both to their distaste for writing endings and their ADD giddiness to move onward -- the troupe finds uncharacteristic continuity here, examining one fertile topic from each of its absurd angles. Yet the movie is still comprised of distinct segments, any of which could serve as a favorite for fans who want to recite the choicest dialogue and make converts of the uninitiated. But for five minutes of sheer uncontrollable hysterics, one need only watch the scene in which Graham Chapman steadily lops the limbs from a foolishly determined knight, who continues issuing taunts even after he's been totally neutralized. Irritated more than threatened, Chapman's King Arthur keeps hacking at the prating cripple just to shut him up -- it's the only sane reaction in this ridiculous world full of delusional windbags. Chapman is a wonderful constant as the frustrated straight man, and his colleagues lob one demented set piece after another ""in his general direction."" The temptation is to enumerate these clever interludes, but a catapulted cow really needs to be seen to be appreciated. The only time Monty Python and the Holy Grail stumbles is at its sudden ending, a cop-out that's pure Python.

One example is the fight with the black knight. It's one of the greatest fight scenes in movie history, and it has some of the greatest dialog (""I'll have you, you wait and see!"" ""What are you going to do, bleed on me?""). The song ""Knights of the Round Table"" should have been nominated for an Oscar. It's another perfect example of how hilariously insane this film is. This, as well as the oddly abrupt ending (King Arthur and co charge at the French castle but get stopped by the police, one of which breaks the camera and ends the film) are just two of the many many reasons why this is one of the funniest films I've ever seen.

Maybe I just don't get British humour (well really, it's not about ""not getting it"", it's more about just not finding it funny), but I don't find this movie entirely funny. Maybe others do, and kudos to them! But this doesn't entertain me. I'm not saying I didn't laugh though. There were humorous and hilarious parts, but I was hyped up and expecting a gut busting movie, so I was disappointed. The coconuts were humorous (funny the first time, then it became tedious), I laughed my ass off when John Cleese decapitated an entire wedding party, and when he in turn was decapitated (albeit in an earlier scene). I also thought the Killer rabbit was extremely hilarious, and the bridge was funny too. Also, the logic of the witch burning was amusing. But 10 minutes of funny from a 1 and a half hour movie isn't too good, especially since I heard this movie is a comedy classic. This is one of the reasons I have mixed feelings about Dogma as well. There are some friggin' hilarious parts, but some boring parts as well (I understand they are moving the plot along, and respect that). However, I just enjoy Dogma more. Back to The Holy Grail.

Our teacher said nothing of what kind of movie this was, so everyone thought it was serious until about 2 minutes into the opening scene.

Since there are so many strange and silly obstacles, and so incredibly absurd humor, this movie is one strange, though extremely funny way of picturing the knights of the round table.The acting is this movie is also flawless.

458,charliedoble,Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975) Film Review,9,3 October 2016,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is my favourite comedy of all time. I laugh every single time I see it, and find something new that I didn't notice before. I strongly urge you to see it even if you're not a Python fan.The movie is directed by Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam. Before this film was released, Monty Python was a television series called 'Monty Python's Flying Circus' and a lot of the movie did feel sort of like a collection of skits from the show. That isn't really a flaw, but I thought I should address it in this review. Normally in a review, you have to explain the basic plot of the movie you're talking about to fill the reader in. But the thing with this film is that there really isn't one. Its more like a collection of scenes that are loosely tied together, like it was an episode of Flying Circus. There is still a plot, King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table have to find the Holy Grail for God, but in the middle the movie sort of forgets that and just does its own thing for a bit. Then in the third act it picks up the story again. Again, this isn't a bad thing because the movie is so damn strange that you hardly notice it. Speaking of funny, this is, in my opinion, the best comedy ever made. All of the actors play off each other really well, Its extremely well written, it has tons of verbal and visual gags that make me laugh almost every time I see it, and, well... its just funny! Some of it does seem slightly dated and you can see that they had a very low budget, but I think it just adds to the charm and strangeness of the film. Its also a great satire of all of the big budget epics of the 50's and 60's.In conclusion, I think Monty Python and the Holy Grail is the best comedy of all time. Its strange, funny and everything else that you want from a comedy.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

I have been a Monty Python fan for about fifteen of my twenty years on this planet. The movie is by far one of my favorites, along with all the other Python flicks. If you are looking for something to suit your taste for the Arthurian legend...well I am sorry the name of King Arther and the use of Camelot, a very silly place, is just about as far as you will get.

They are portrayed as true thespians put in ridiculous situations and that makes the whole thing work. Put simply there are no bad scenes or lulls. The ending, which so many people here seem to complain about is great. It is hilarious. It works, too. This is the only, the ONLY, comedy I have seen over and over and yet find myself laughing out loud. The AFI and its' politically maneuvered list of the 100 best comedies ever is a farce.

There definitely isn't a dull moment -- you'll laugh until your sides ache and your eyes fill with tears. From man-eating rabbits to shrub-lusting giant knights, The Holy Grail is the art of absurdity and satire at its most potent (and who could forget that famous duel with the black knight?).

It sets a precedent for the Pythons as they moved into films from the hugely successful TV series. Several of the scenes in it have attained cult status not least the Black Knight fight scene, the rude Frenchman and the Knights who say ""Nee"". The ending is a little bit of a let down, that is true but the Python boys never kept things simple or predictable. The fact that they don't get hold of the Grail only seems to compound how bumbling their whole adventure has been. Extra credit should goto co-writer John Cleese who plays some of the movies funniest characters including the Black Knight, Tim the Wizard and Sir Lancelot who can't help hacking people to death. This is a true gem and the comedy hasn't dated in 26 years since it was made. Their humour sets a precedent in what is arguably the best of the three Python films.

Two minutes in, you're already lying on the floor laughing hysterically.It tells the tale of King Arthur and his knights on their quest for the holy grail. Sort of. That's the general outline, anyway. There's not actually all that much in the searching for the grail, but that's not terribly important. In place of a good solid plot, you get the best one liners and physical comedy in the history of the world. I think it's a good trade off, personally.This movie has everything you could ever desire in a movie. It has action, adventure, comedy, and almost romance.

Having Peasants follow behind kings Clucking coconuts so it sounds like a horse and the kings skipping like they are riding horses.

From beginning to end, this movie has so many laugh out loud moments. While I'm not one for dry British humor, there's still plenty of moments that had me chuckling. I first saw this film in my middle school history class (even though we weren't learning about the middle ages at the time) I can still remember so many great scenes that are now permanently in my memory. One of my favorite scenes probably is the opening scene, in which we hear what we think is a horse galloping, but then it turns out to be two knights with one of them clanking two coconuts together to make the noise. Or the famous Black Knight scene- ""Tis just a flesh wound!"", I think not. This comedy also makes fun of some of the crazy ideas people had back then, which include some of the peculiar practices of the church (particularly the monks) and some of the insane witch trials that were performed so many years ago. My only real criticism with the film is that it gets a bit stale from time to time. The first time I remember this is right around the middle, when the knights get the quest from God. I just remember not laughing as much after that point, and it makes it difficult for me to remember many details that occurred after that point in the movie. This is really the only thing that holds it back from being a perfect film, which is saying something since most British TV shows and movies turn me off just at the mention of them.

A great point to this is how the movie is cut. the movie shows the scene then goes to an intermission card saying who the next scene features. the jokes are hilarious making fun of most stories featuring knights and medevil heroes for example there is a scene of king arthur talking to a peasant and the peasant tells him how monarchies are not a proper way to rule.

This is one of those movies you can watch hundreds of times and find something new and funny each time.  I have never been much of a fan of the ""Flying Circus"" TV series, but this film has so much more to offer.Parts of the King arthur story have been maimed so badly by the low-budget of the film that it takes on a humour all its own ADDING to the laughs. There are some weak parts, such as the musical numbers or sketches which are funny but not as robust as the more classic scenes such as the ""black knight"" or ""Lancelot's tale"" or the supremely subliminal ""Coconuts/swallows"" scenes.

The Holy Grail is truly a comical masterpiece. With its frequent references to bodily functions and inappropriate sounds, it is full of teenage guy humour, which is fabulously funny. I know you're probably saying ""get on with it!"" but the humour is much too prominent a thing to simply gloss over.During the film, there are many incidents of elderly women beating carpets with felines. The enchanter, Tim, sounds like Billy Connelly and is referred to as the ""manky Scot"".The film is full of wonderful quotable material, which ranges from the Black Knight's swearing to the French taunting. The special features on the DVD are a great opportunity to make a prize idiot of yourself, which includes singing along to the Monk's Chant and striking your forehead with the DVD box. You can also watch parts of the film in Lego and Japanese, which again creates the opportunity for amusing subtitles. The Holy Grail is definitely one to watch.

You get to see an English documentary or something (no subtitles of course!) and you have to answer question about what you see and hear. My English teacher had the most brilliant plan to practise for one of these tests: We were going to watch The Holy Grail. The reactions were different. A few got a grin on their face, that didn't go away until the film was ended. Others looked bored or annoyed. Monty Python's humour is really particular. I myself was one of the smiling kids: I enjoyed it from the ""wrong subtitles"" at the beginning, until the last step of Arthur and his brave knights. Most people had never seen the film before and were immediately bored when the coconut-conversation came up. As I said, the humour is typical, but it's totally my kind of humour. The film is so ridiculous (think about flesh eating rabbits, never ending conversations about coconuts and a knight, who still lives and wants to fight after he got his arms and legs cut off) it's just very very very funny. I especially love the Brave Sir Robin song and the witch trial.

Not only does this movie make fun of it's self countless times, but succeeds in doing so. The film always has something new to show in the next scene, and never repeats itself or rips off another film.The pacing is... Well... Random. but it only adds to the movie.

If your teenager see's it watch them react to all the cheesy effects and old school humor. If your the person that likes a good graphic action movie i recommend you to NOT see it. If you're the person that likes a good laugh in front of a 1970's comedy. Either way, it will probably bring a hint of a smile to your face.

I'd even go so far as to say that this film intentionally utilized poor visual effects and more than a few plot holes just to make the movie funnier. Although there are some scenes I find a little too vulgar for my taste (that's what the DVD remote is for), I think it's a perfect mix of pure silliness, clever wittiness, and parody of historical/literary facts.

There are so many laugh-out-loud moments in this film that you can't help loving it. Despite not being quite as random as Monty Python's sketch show, there are still truly bizarre moments, like the coconut horses, the knights of the round table song, the bible bashing monk characters, the killer rabbit, the black night, the knights that say ""Ni!"" and the castle ""Aargh"".

Well I finally saw it the other day, and ugh, I had to turn it off halfway through.First of all, it appears shot on 16mm, with all the production value of a community college student film (zooms included).The jokes fall horribly flat. They kept using that ""coconuts for horses"" bit that got tired after about 2 minutes. The killer rabbit scene looked like some sort of slasher movie, way out of the realm of silly comedy. There are scenes with a lot of fog, which give the feel of a foreboding atmosphere, like a Braveheart like battle is about to break out, but this doesn't belong too well in a comedy flick.

I'm not going to tell you that any of the actors in this film are great. I'm not going to tell you that any of the people involved in this movie are good at any part of making movies. The Monty Python group made a number of productions, several of which I own, but the rest pale in comparison to this masterpiece. I view this as a collection of superb individual skits that happen to form a ""story."" Each is so insanely hysterical that I can hardly believe that anyone had it in their mind to create it. From the banter between the French and the ""silly English kanigits,"" the rational of the ""scientists,"" to the mind boggling use of coconuts to simulate the sounds of a horse and other low-budget props make this movie an absolute classic.

539,timprobert,Narrowly beats Life of Brian as the finest British comedy,10,9 October 2003,"There are faults with this film, the cinematography is far from ideal, in parts it is poorly lit, the camera angles are poor and the sound is not great. However, the Pythons' were given peanuts or should that be coconuts to make Holy Grail so this can be forgiven. And the ending is week, but again they had university students working for 4 pounds a day and they simply ran out of cash to film the intended battle sequence. Despite its shortcomings, in my humble opinion, this is an almost perfect comedy. The Python team - John Cleese, Eric Idle, Graham Chapman, Terry Jones, Terry Gilliam and Michael Palin were some of the finest writer/performers of their generation. Each of them went on to be a success in their own right. Cleese is widely regarded as the best writer of his era; Gilliam has made a series of weird and wonderful films;  Jones a writer, director and TV historian; Palin an award winning actor, and numerous TV travelogues; Idle did the Rutles and many other films; Chapman was less successful after Python but continued to act and write before his death from cancer. So for such people to be together in a project is unusual, much like the Beatles in that regard. I digress. Holy Grail has many wonderful moments: The Black Knight, the Witch, the French Taunter, Sir Galahad, the Bridge of Death. Holy Grail is less a plot-driven film more a series of sketches on a Medieval theme but purely brilliant nonetheless. Many cite Life of Brian as the best Python film but for me it seems too clean, too polished for a Python production. As a keen fan of the original TV series, Holy Grail is more true to the Python experience of the BBC  - crude, imperfect genius.  All the obvious pennypinching only makes it funnier - the use of coconuts in place of horses for one. If you are thinking of seeing/renting/buying this film, let me assure you it will be one of the finest cinematic purchases you will ever make.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

As a child I loved the slapstick of the monks whacking themselves in the head with boards (or is it Bibles?), the Black Knight refusing to give way at the bridge when challenged, the funny weird people digging in the mud.As an adult I then marvelled at the intelligent and hilarious satire of religious and political subjects of which I had no inkling when I first fell in love with this film:  The monks are penitents, and no crazier that many of their true-history contemporaries.  The Black Knight is a psychopathic serial killer.  The mud people are Fir Bolg members of an Anarchist commune (or is it Socialist?  Anarcho-Syndicalist?) and the Knights are riding along Hadrian's Wall.Even later in life now, as a Celtic scholar, I'm again impressed by their knowledge of myth and history, and by how well they not only satirize, but further illuminate, The Matter of Britain.This film should be required viewing for all classes in Celtic Studies, World Mythology, Marxist Thought in the 20th Century, Folklore, The Applied Sciences, Astronomy, Folk Dancing, Fencing, Witch Hunting, Archery, Shrubbery, Moose Hunting, Religious History and Anarcho-Syndicalist Communes.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

There is no question that the Python team were talented comedians; that this film was excellent in its time and that its influences are still being felt today. However when I watched it recently I barely laughed and could not help but feel that this film has been overhyped in the years since its release. I think The Life of Brian is still a great piece of comedy and can be enjoyed as much today as it could 20 years ago but not The Holy Grail. Having watched nearly every episode of sitcoms such as Fawlty Towers, Only Fools and Horses and Blackadder before the film I can see that these shows have built on the comedy of The Holy Grail and are finer works because of it. But having seen these before the film I found the humour old fashioned, outdated and *gasp* predictable, something which would not be true when it was released. People have claimed that young people today do not 'get' comedies such as this but I would say that humour has evolved and now slicker, more sophisticated comedies have left dinosaurs such as this little more than reference points in comedy history.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

It's a Monty Python movie.From the opening scene (Please Wait a Moment While the Operator Changes Reels) and the opening credits (mind you, moose bites can be nasti) you can tell that this is a movie that delights in zany randomness. It's a movie that knows it's stupid, and that revels in its stupidity. And it's a good thing.So instead of complaining that this movie has too much plot, I'm going to complain about the opposite thing--the one reason I didn't give this movie 10 out of 10: it has too much plot. And the storyline there is seems forced and...well, yes, stupid. But not in a good way this time. Instead, it seems like a poor attempt to restrain the strange humor of Monty Python. So my advice is, watch the movie. But don't concentrate on the plot. Don't concentrate on what's going on. Ignore it. Watch the movie like a series of Monty Python skits--some of the funniest ones out there too, although it's tough to beat the dead parrot--because really, that's what it is.

Making it less humorous the second time you watch it. I feel that the life of Brian is a better Monty python film. The holy grail seems less focused, and the pythons have really gone out of there way to put as many small jokes into this film as possible, but there aren't that many that make you scream with laughter.As a one off comedy film you cannot get much better than this, but my patience for this film has lead me to the point where I refuse to watch it for a year or so before watching it again.

554,julie-siegrist,Monty Python and the Holy Grail,8,20 April 2016,"In the 1970's Hollywood's economic crisis gave way to a number of low budget blockbusters. These low budget films, when successful, brought millions back in box office revenue. The 70's gave way to some of the most memorable films in Hollywood's history: one of them being Terry Gilliam & Terry Jones' Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The humorous retelling of King Arthur's search for the Holy Grail made the best out of a small budget and still stands out to many as one of the best films from the 70's.Stylistically, Monty Python and the Holy Grail doesn't seem like a huge leap forward upon first glance. The film, like many other movies of the same time period, took some of its inspiration from famous literature; primarily the stories of King Arthur and his Knights of the Roundtable influenced the plot of the quest for the grail and the characters. The film was shot on location at multiple different locations across the United Kingdom and aerial shots were cleverly used to give us a sense of being among the castle walls looking down upon the knights as they conversed with guards. Necessity also gave way to the actors playing multiple roles in the film, Michael Palin playing the most characters at 12.Editing in Monty Python's Holy Grail used one of the newly popular techniques in filmmaking at the time: parallel editing. Two separate events, occurring at the same time are shown back-to-back to show that these events are occurring at the same time but in a different space. Transitions also hold a major role in the style Holy Grail presents. A storybook motif is used at a point to move the story along, as well are a number of animations drawn stylistically to resemble illuminated manuscripts of medieval times, and the use of a narrator (whom is introduced as quickly as departs). As a comedy the humor in Monty Python and the Holy Grail had to stand out against other comedies of the time in order to mark it as a film worth remembering. Monty Python's writers imbue The Holy Grail with their unique brand of humor that was accessible to a wide variety of audiences. Their humor also made comments on issues and made the mundane humorous. Even the credit sequence itself, taking its inspiration from Igmar Bergman's foreign films, uses the credits and the subtitles in a humorous context. The credits begin to argue with themselves (over the humorous addition of inaccurate Swedish subtitles making jokes about a møøse and then further jokes related to llamas). Some of the prop related humor was a direct result of the small budget the film had to work from. Real horses were unaffordable which gave way to coconut halves being used akin to radio sound effect production. The result, though born of necessity, made the film all the more memorable. The humor in Monty Python and the Holy Grail ranges greatly from simple slapstick like humor to political and social satirical humor. They used the opportunity to let their humor make comments on politics (Arthur's conversation with the man and woman digging through the filth), common sense & mass hysteria (the trial of the Witch), society, and religion (the monks hitting themselves with planks of wood). Films in the late 60's and the 70's had a habit of taking on a political undertone and Monty Python's Holy Grail doesn't disappoint in that aspect. Holy Grail's shining moments however may lie in how it questions continuity and the concept of stories existing in their own world separate from our own. Dialog continuity is made into a joke numerous times as characters have multiple side conversations unrelated to the plot, and plot continuity itself is questioned with the sudden 'intermission' alluding to theatrical performances and with the film's abrupt ending giving no sign of a resolution. The 4th wall, which usually contains a story within itself, counting the audience as just viewers; broken numerous times in Holy Grail for humorous effect. Characters will address to the audience, make comments about set models, acting, scenes, etc. even sometimes prompting the other actors to tell them to ""Get on with it."" The sudden introduction of the narrator even breaks the 4th wall since he becomes part of the story and is killed off in a matter of seconds (the 'animator' of the animated transitions and the monster they face in the cave suffers a similar fate).Overall, while the quality of the film at first might appear like it is nothing special, the content is what really drives it home.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
555,ps3092004,Monty Python is the greatest!,9,1 October 2012,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is an exciting humorous tale that follows King Arthur as he and his Knights of the Round Table embark on a quest for the Holy Grail. What happens on their guest is way beyond what they expected. In the movie King Arthur means more than a king, he stands as a man for Britain, man of integrity, and bravery. This is all done when he is asked by God to search for the Holy Grail during this dark time in hope it can bring happiness to all the people of Britain. In the movie the forest plays a pivotal role because most of the scenes, especially the important scenes take place in the woods. What makes this different is that when most of the trouble happens dark in the woods there it is always foggy. The fog gives the movie the suspense, not knowing where someone or something is around a person when it could be very close.When it comes to King Arthur and the writing of the film, I believe that it is good writing. This movie is supposed to be a comedy but for the role of King Arthur was played perfectly because he stood as a man of integrity, bravery and as a man for his people. He was doing the right things to acquire the Holy Grail, it just so happens they run into some shenanigans along the way. There are some things in the move than were similar and can be grouped together. There were parts in the movie that came in pairs or that can be grouped together. At the beginning King Arthur was trying to find knights to join his Round Table and they arrived at a castle. Later on there were two separate scenes with the French taunting. Also when King Arthur found his Knights of The Round Table they each so happened to get a servant to follow them around. When they all split up to look for the Holy Grail, along their ways each one of them encountered some kind of peril in a dense forest with a lot of fog, that add to the suspense with what was going on with each of them.From watching medieval movies in the past I kind of knew what to expect, but when I watched this and realized it was a comedy it changed my mind. From watching movies and from classes I knew that King Arthur is really important back in the medieval era. I knew the bravery he had and how he wanted to make Britain a great place for him and his people. All medieval films are serious and comedic, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is my MLK film, therefore it is comedic and serious.From this movie there are new things that I learned. From the normal perspective I would have just seen the movie as entertainment, but this time I had to look at the movie from a different angle and think about it differently. I never knew how much fog was used as an element in this movie. It was used a lot in the movie but it was used for suspense and I didn't realize that before. When watching the movie previously I really just listened to the music and that drew me in. Also I never really knew the great lengths King Arthur and his men went to try to acquire the Holy Grail. From just trying to find men to help to battling monsters, King Arthur went to great lengths to do what god said he should do. From looking at this movie from a different angle I've noticed things I have never seen before.This movie takes on a comedic tale of King Arthur and his men go on a quest for the Holy Grail. Battling mythological creatures, black knights, and bridge keepers along the way, King Arthur might bite off more than he can chew in this comedic adventure.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

We laugh a lot on it today too, we usually watch it again and again just like other films kind of this. The movie could make us to enjoy the older creations and later, when we got a bit old, found out the real meaning of the story and the scenes. If You watch it for the first time, then do search for some criticism. You will find out what is it all about, I'm sure. There are a lot of funny scenes and quotes that can fade the real messages but if you can see through this, not necessary for the first time.

The Monty Pythons really make the most of the absurd and you are constantly thinking: ""Did I miss something?"", and that (apart from other things) makes you want to watch it over and over again. The Plot: King Arthur, king of the Britons is collecting knights to join his court at the Castle Camelot, when all of a sudden, his is given a task by God. He has to find the Holy Grail. This task involves a mysterious Wizard that some call Tim. There is also the Holy Handgranade of Antioc. Other key parts are played by a Shrubber, a furry white rabbit and a cartoonist who suffers a heart-attack. The eating of minstrels is also a source of enjoyment. The completely crazy sense of humor associated with the Monty Pythons is evident in the movie. If you like this movie, you will probably also enjoy ""Eric the Viking"" as well as ""Life of Brian"", both with Monty Python. Funniest moment: The Crossing of the Bridge of Death. Oh, and when the Black Knight wont give up. Oh, and when the furry little rabbit turns out to be quite nasty. And so on, and so on... You must see it!",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

Also, it never gets old for me. It is quite hard to choose a favorite scene, since they are all so ingenious. I truly applaud all of the actors in the film, because their knack for comedy is simply unmatched. Some people I know don't seem to understand Monty Python. I think it's a kind of humor that is difficult for ""normal"" people to understand. But for us MP lovers, we know it and we don't care if any thinks we are losers.

There are one or two other Monty Python movies, however, Holy Grail needs no context or backstory. Nor do you need to watch the other/s after watching this one.

570,austinpassler,The greatest comedy of all time,10,25 February 2018,"Monty Python's take on King Arthur is the definitive comedy of all time. It features everything from the banter in modern comedies, think the talk of sparrows and coconuts, to the slapstick humor ever present in comedy, think the black knight. 
This movie is a combo of farce and satire. It parodies King Arthur movies and movies in general. The part about King Arthur is fairly self evident, but for general movies, it makes fun of them by pointing out flaws in all types of movies. This begins in the opening credits with the subtitles about a Swedish moose and continues through the unconventional ending. The farce can be seen through all the misunderstandings and general silliness. From a bunny being the most dangerous killer to coconuts replacing a horse, this farce is used to full effect.
On top of all this, this movie was made on a minuscule budget and features amazing effects for the time, especially keeping this budget in mind. This movie has certainly paved the way for all modern comedies.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

I have a wicked sense of humour and I have tried and tried to find something funny in all of the Python films, but I have yet to have a real good laugh.I wonder sometimes if there's an ""emperor's clothes"" type of mentality surrounding these movies; I'll pretend to like it so as I'll belong to the ""I get it club"".

To try to describe it to someone who hasn't experienced is useless, because most of the movie doesn't really make any sense at all and would simply sound stupid. However, as anyone who's seen it can say, this movie contains more hilarious material than most great comedies put together. There's not really any explaining why it's so funny, it just is. Anyone who doesn't laugh during this should be checked for a pulse. If you haven't seen this, do yourself a favor and immediately do so. If you have, see it again. If there's one movie you can't see too many times, it's this one. Passed off of as silly garbage by many, the genius of this film doesn't get the recognition it deserves.

I rented it a few months ago, and I nearly got sick laughing. There was no attempt at plot- which I consider an advantage- the movie didn't make sense, and if it had, it wouldn't have been half as funny! It's the bizarreness- (Is that a word? Doesn't matter.)- that makes it so entertaining. I had seen the Life of Brian, so I had some idea of what to expect, but from the coconuts, to the French taunter, to the Black Knight, to the Knights of Ni and their penchant for shrubs, to the politically aware peasants living in an autonomous collective, to God and the Beast of Aaarrgh, and the killer bunny- well, basically, the whole movie was like being slapped by a fish! In a good way! I showed it to my mother, my brother, my two best friends, the kid I babysit for, and heck, when I had to give it back to the video library I was heartbroken. But I have rented it again and again and it's still just as good as the first time. Some people think the ending is a cop-out, and maybe it is, and I'll admit that I was disappointed, but that's what it's there for- having enjoyed the jokes, you have one played on you- there is no punchline, just annoying music!

The acting is superb, the plot and writing are masterful, and the effects (as usual for the pythons) just connect with me on some level that makes them seem perfect. What i'm about to say may well be cliché'd, but I don't care. The low budget actually improves the film, it adds to the charm the rest of the film exudes so well. There are two reasons I can think of for anyone to not like this film.1) Not being English and not getting our humour. 2) Being a fool.Neither of these detract from the film's perfection. In fact it's probably better than not everyone loves the film; it prevents it from stagnating.

605,rebekahshoaf,Great Movie!,10,17 March 2020,"Silly, fun, ridiculous situations and a roaring musical number! That just some of what awaits you in Monty Python and the Holy Grail! The movie is a reimagined, low budget telling of King Arthur and the knights of the round table searching for the holy Grail. Think of it as a movie version of a group of teen boys role playing Dungeon and Dragons; King Arthur addition! Their sitting at a table making up the story as they go; telling fart jokes and hurling silly insults to make each other laugh.
The cast of Monty Python Graham Chapman (King Arthur), John Cleese (Sir Launcelot), and Eric Idle (Sir Robin) each play a leading character as well as many minor ones throughout the movie. The movie moves from cartoon to modern times and back to medieval times like only Monty Python can do! Their signature humor and tilted way they see the world makes for a fabulous good time!
The story begins as King Arthur is searching for honest good men to join his Knights of the round table. On his journey he meets several strange and bizarre characters, such as the Black Knight. The Black Knight challenges King Arthur to a dual and as they fight Arthur cuts off the knight's arm! Still the knight taunts him and says ""it's merely a flesh wound!"" (Fostater, & White 1975); they continue to fight until the knight has no legs or arms! King Arthur, realizing The Black Knight is a loon, and turns to leave as the Black Knight yells at him to come back and he will bite his ankles!
After much searching Arthur finally finds the brave men that will fight by his side. As King Arthur, Sir Launcelot, Sir Robin and others are on their journey they are called on by the great cartoon God in the clouds. He tells them to find the Holy Grail; they except the challenge and start the quest. Their adventure takes them to one ludicrous scenario after another! From the Knights that say Ni in need of a shrubbery to rude French guards that yell insults and taunt them.
This is defiantly a low budget film but that only adds to the greatness of it! Some scenes are cartoon, and the special effects are pretty bad, and its perfect! There's a killer rabbit that flies around on a string ripping peoples throats out. At one point the Knights (who are now cartoons) are chased by a cartoon monster, but were saved when the artist had a heart attack! The dialogue is funny and the acting is excellent. The story is all over the place with silly conversations and ridiculous situations. This movie is epic, you won't regret watching it.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

I am amazed at how anyone could think this is even the slightest bit funny, let alone clever. The acting and production quality is also horrendous but I suppose that can be attributed to the very low budget. Then again, you can be a lot more creative with a low budget than to wear halloween costumes and wander through a forest with your friends. And that's really what it all feels like to me: A home movie made a group of friends and full of inside jokes that only they would understand. The fact that this has been screened in theaters and gained almost nothing but praise and admiration over the decades is truly one of the great mysteries of humanity to me.

Monty Python and the Holy GrailThe movie starts out with the intro of the movie Dentist on the Job (1961) And now for something completely different, the plot of the movie. Arthur, Son of Uther Pendragon, from the castle of Camelot. King of the Britons, defeater of the Saxons. Sovereign of all England! (Graham Chapman) And Patsy (Terry Gilliam) is looking for some knights to join him at his court at Camelot. The wise Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones) was the first to join, but other were soon to follow. Sir Lancelot the Brave (John Cleese), Sir Galahad the Pure (Michael Palin), Sir Robin the Not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot who had nearly fought the Dragon of Angnor, who nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol and who had personally wet himself at the battle of Badon Hill (Eric Idle) and Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film (William Palin). Together they formed a band whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries. The Knights of the Round Table. But when they finely get to Camelot (it's only a model!) they find out that ""it's a busy life in Camelot"" so they decide that they do not want to go there ""it is a silly place"". While walking away, God (Graham Chapman) come to them from a cloud and tells them to find the Holy Grail in order to ""make them an example in these dark times"". While they search for the Grail, Arthur, having consulted his closest knights decided that they should separate, and search for the Grail individually. Throughout their search they meet interesting people and knights along the way. Most of the characters die; some through a killer rabbit (which they defeat with the holy hand grenade of Antioch), some from answering a question wrong at the bridge of Death, or die some other ridiculous way. In the end, King Arthur and Sir Bedevere are left and find the Castle Arrrghhh where the Holy Grail is. They are met by some French soldiers who taunted them earlier in the film, so they decided to attack with their full force but the police stop the knights before they could do any damaged to the castle of Guy de Loimbard. And now, number 1. The large, the large, and now number 1. Why did I like this film?I don't know what it is with this movie that makes it one of the best movies in the world.

619,bohsol,This movie BLOWS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,26 December 2007,"This is one of the worst movies ever, and it should not exist. The reason I watched it, is because I love comedy, and this movie is rated as one of the best comedies of all time, by several different sources. However, it is extremely boring, and not funny at all. One black knight scene in a forest is SOMEWHAT funny, but that's IT. Three or four minutes of funniness is not enough to carry the whole movie.For the record, I've noticed that I'm not alone, and there are MANY people here who strongly dislike this movie. I thought most of them did a good job at explaining WHY they don't like the movie.After all, it's not FAIR to say that a movie is bad, without explaining WHY... Yet, even though most of the people who gave this movie a bad rating, did a GOOD JOB at explaining why, their reviews STILL received a low percentage of being considered ""helpful."" This is probably because the people who DO enjoy this movie came here and rated those reviews as ""not helpful,"" just because they disagree with ANY negative opinions of this horrible dumb movie.So what I've decided to do, is give the movie a perfect rating (10 out of 10), even though it SUCKS! That way, its score will remain high, which will cause MORE people to watch the movie, and see for THEMSELVES how awful it is.In other words, since most people don't even RESPECT these (negative but ""honest"") reviews as being helpful, my advice is for everyone to see this movie for their self. That way, the AWARENESS will be raised, of how terrible it is, and maybe it can FINALLY shake off its over-rated status, not necessarily on this website, but in the minds of the PEOPLE.Remember, I didn't just say the movie was bad... I actually told you WHY it's bad, in my first paragraph (which, again is: because it attempts to be a comedy, even though it's not funny at all). But I know people are STILL going to consider my review to be ""not helpful."" I'm guessing that ZERO out of 100 people will find it helpful, and I really don't CARE!

I'm not a movie critique therefore I can't say what they did wrong and how they could have done it better. But on the other hand I don't think I would, this movie is British comedy at its best.

For the record I can inform MattyMatt that R. Atkinson has also made a successful show called ""Black Adder"". It is set in medieval time as well as ""Monty P. and the Holy Grail"" and I'm afraid it is a bit 'bloody' at times as well...

627,adeadliersnake,Absolutely horrible.....,1,6 November 2010,"Well going into this movie i had very low expectations, despite the high amounts of praise it has received. I had heard for years how funny and amazing this movie is. So i finally felt that i needed to watch it. I had procrastinated watching it for far too long. Well, the truth is, i didn't procrastinate watching long enough. I wish i had never watched it. After 25 minutes, I had to shut it off, which makes this the worst movie i have ever watched. The so-called jokes in this movie are completely unfunny. These ""jokes"" are on par with middle school toilet humor. Worse actually. This movie is a constant bombardment of stupidity. After watching 25 minutes of it, i felt like i had gone insane. I needed to know that i wasn't the only one who felt like this was utter trash, so i came here to see if anyone else felt the same. Thankfully i am not alone.Im not that great at writing reviews, but in short, the ""jokes"" are infantile at best.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
628,K_Bar89-574-946945,Classic comedy for the ages,10,15 February 2019,"Greetings. If you are actually reading a review for Monty Python's Holy Grail, you are either newly returned from a 50 year coma or are recovering from a serious moose attack and have nothing better to do. If you've been in a coma for half a century it would stand to reason you have a lot to catch up on, and surely Monty Python is a wise use of your time. For the moose-afflicted, I wish you a speedy recovery.Monty Python is a simple test to determine compatibility with someone. ""Python"" is a brand of quirky British whit and comedic timing that is a style unto itself. If your sense of humor finds Monty Python funny then you have an immediate kinship with others of similar taste.The Holy Grail is hilarious from start to finish, and fans of this movie have easily viewed it dozens of times. The dialogue is ridiculous and full of memorable character exchanges between Arthur and the mud peasants, Arthur and the Dark Knight, Arthur and the Frenchmen, and on and on and on.Visually this movie is filled with practical effects, filmed on location in rustic locations and interlaced with trademark Monty Python stop-motion animated scene transitions.And if you ever find yourself confronted with a rabid moose, stand perfectly still. They can't see you if you don't move. Alternatively, feel free to run. Really it'll be your call. I mean, you're the one in the woods with a rabid moose so whether or not you recall some nitwit's advice from an online movie review will be something to tell the grandkids. If you survive... which I hope you do...",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
629,marcus-walsh,Inspired lunacy,10,27 August 2010,"With close to 600 reviews on IMDb, nearly all of them wildly positive, one adds another about Month Python and the Holy Grail for much the same reason as one lights a candle in a church - to pay tribute to something or somebody that truly deserves to be remembered no matter how many others may have done it before.Inspired lunacy from start to end, this is a one-off film unlike any other and certainly the Python team at its peak. A sure sign of its unique features is that it hasn't been copied: there is no Holy Grail #2, Holy Grail Revisited or whatever for the simple reason that even the cretin script writers of today are brainy enough to realise this level of skill is untouchable - the Holy Grail, in fact.I first howled with laughter at this flick aged fifteen, a few years after its release, and consider myself lucky - giggly teen age is probably the best time to be initiated to Python. Tonight, watching my own son go into paroxysms over the Black Night losing all his limbs, and the gorge guardian being flung down for confusing his swallows, made me realise that the Holy Grail has become an unlikely classic. It may well be one of the 50-odd 1900s films being watched in the year 3000. The Pythons did a lot of overrated stuff, but this is sublime.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

This movie takes many of their dubious slapstick elements from Faulty Towers and Flying Circus to a new level. I feel that, along with The Life of Brian, this is the penultimate of British humor. John Cleese, Graham Chapman, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, and Michael Palin present a most wonderful rendition of King Arthur. Every time I think of scenes from this movie I can't help but double over laughing.

The words can't be understood easily. some scenes were violent and horrible. I regret watching it. It is a very low intelligent movie. It was made with low taste of jokes.

639,PrestonP,"""Holy Grail"" as medicine",10,22 July 2005,"When I was a teenager my Mom taught me an invaluable lesson: whenever you're down and depressed, or in a bad mood, put on a funny movie or TV show; it won't ""get you"" at first but eventually it will put a smile on your face. And, boy, was she right, and there's no better cure for a case of the blues than ""Holy Grail.""Years ago, I was in a real depressed funk about a breakup with my girlfriend. I mean, I was devastated. Not caring about anything in the world at the time(I think we've all been there and know that ""great"" feeling), I decided to heed my Mom's advice and played my tape of ""Holy Grail."" But nothing was making me laugh at all, until about an hour into the film. And you know what scene finally ""got me?"" They're about to start the wedding at Swamp Castle, and Launcelot begins his mad dash to save(what he thinks) is a fair maiden. And they show the same clip of him running towards the castle, with the dramatic drumroll, but he never gets any closer. It's the same clip, over & over! We all know the scene; I don't need to describe it. Like many of you, I've seen the movie countless times, but for some reason I found that more scene more hilarious than ever before. I rewound the tape and watched the movie again from the beginning, and was laughing my ass off as usual. I was still in the funk, but the movie provided a temporary respite, and a giant leap towards getting over the breakup.To make someone laugh in that situation, a movie must be just incredibly funny. You guys have all made great posts about this fantastic film, and I just wanted to add my two cents.It is truly a masterpiece, and if you are ever depressed for any reason, put it on. Trust me, it will cheer you up eventually.PS-R.I.P. Graham Chapman. 1/8/41-10/4/89. We all still miss you.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

In it, the Monty python troupe plays King Arthur and the Knights of the round table. It is filled with a large amount of clever humor, as well as some dumb (yet funny) humor. The movie features all the members of the Monty Python crew. It also has some animations just like the television show. Anyone who likes the show, or the other movies would love this movie.

642,justinbindi,The Magnificent Quest for the Holy Grail,10,9 November 2012,"Many people enjoy the most hilarious movie of all time, Monty Python and the Holy Grail. The directors (Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones), did a great job directing this movie and putting things all together. The things that really put the movie in the top of the charts is the content, actors, and the special effects and animation put into the movie. Everybody loves the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail.First of all, what makes this movie spectacular is the content of the movie itself. The directors and the writers of the movie really put a lot of time and effort to make sure that this movie is the best of the best. This movie starts off with King Arthur, King of the Britons, on a quest to search for knights to join him in his quest for Camelot. After that, once King Arthur has found his loyal knights they found Camelot. However, besides staying in Camelot, which they decide not to do with literally a song and a dance, they are talked to by God. God tells them that they are now on a quest for the Holy Grail, a chalice used by Christ at the Last Supper. This, the knights are now off on an asinine mission to find the hidden Holy Grail. His story is the best that it could for a movie that is a comedy.Furthermore, the second stupendous thing about this movie is the actors that play the roles in this whimsical movie. The actors in the movie: Graham Chapman, John Clesse, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones, Michael Pain, etc., do a fantastic job in the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail. One unbelievable thing that astonishes me is that all of the actors have a abounding amount of roles to play in the movie. There is one example when the actor Graham Chapman (King Arthur, Voice of God, Middle Head, and Hiccoughing Guard) had a scene where he is talking to himself. To demonstrate, Graham starts out as God saying, ""What are you doing now?"" and then Graham comes in again as King Arthur and says, ""Averting our eyes, oh Lord."" Accordingly, God says back to him again and says, ""Well, don't. It's just like those miserable psalms, always so depressing. Now knock it off!"" This is just one of the plentiful examples how Monty Python and the Holy Grail is the most preeminent movie of all of history.Conversely, some people may not agree with me on the matter. Some people would even go even to a ridiculous accusation that the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail is deficient. Well I am here to tell you otherwise. I am just pointing out that the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail has gotten many incredibly amazing reviews by critics and also that it received a 95% from the critics running the rating website ""Rotten Tomatoes"". The Monty Python and the Holy Grail is and will continue to be the most unsurpassed comedy forever. Moreover, the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a prevailing movie because of the special effects and the animation incorporated into certain parts of the movie. The directors of the movie knew exactly when to use the skill of animation to make the movie more interesting without making you think that it complete animation. It is also extremely well written because the directors and movie editors give a nice twist in style of the movie by adding the animations in the different parts of the movie. There is one part of the animation scenes that I believe to very clever; it was a very eye-catching part of the movie. It was when the knights are being chased by the animated monster in the cave and the way they made it go away is by saying that the animator had a fatal heart attack was very clever idea. This is just one of the many examples on how the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail is the best comedy ever made.There are many reasons for everybody to go out and see the movie Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Some of the copious reasons to go see the movie include the content, actors, and the special effects and animation put into the movie. If you you are a comedy lover or a Monty Python fan then I encourage you to go and see this movie. If you are not one of these people and are somebody that thinks that the Monty Python is intolerable or you are just someone who dislikes comedy I embolden you to go and see the Month Python and the Holy Grail.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
643,jrdu,my comments are from a long time John Cleese fan,10,18 September 2004,"the holy grail is an interesting film that i watch every month, classic comedy, that anyone with a sense of humor, including varying degrees of dry humor, can watch and enjoy. i love the fact that the movie is so not professional in structure and costume ans settings, it gives the whole film an entire taste or feel. i know this is a classic Python method, but this form of British comedy is going to be timeless. you will find that comedy will never return to this style, nothing here is slapstick but it gets close. 'it's just a flesh wound', is a common saying of mine, as with 'big sharp pointy teeth', i have to say that this film has in fact effected my life on an almost daily level. however one question still remains for me, what are those peasants actually digging for, why is Dennis after some lovely slope in the river bed?",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

""We are not to enter the room, until u come and get'em!"", ""No, you stay here, and make sure, E, dosn't leave""!

This movie has plenty of information to weave a coherent plot line around; it just fails to do so. The special effects, well what am I saying- there are no special effects worth mentioning.

647,luke_stein,A Summary in so many words would have to be.... NI,10,3 May 2013,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is an overall great movie directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, starring the usual suspects in a Monty Python film such as Graham Champman, and John Cleese. In this film we find ourselves following our main character King Arthur (Graham Chapman) as he gathers his knights of the round table to embark on a quest to find the Holy Grail. The actors in this film defiantly DO NOT live up to any historical depiction of any king or knight that may have ever existed, but this is what we have come to love and expect out of the Monty Python crew. The style and theme of this film can only be described as cheap in the best sort of way. One would assume that in medieval times travel would mostly be done on horses, well Monty Python does not disappoint. No expense was speared when collecting the coconuts used to produce hoof sounds throughout the movie. That's right there are no horses in this movie, just men acting as if they were on horses while another man follows them around with coconuts. In conclusion I would have to say that following these men around on their adventure is definitely time well spent. I'll be watching this movie over and over, and will be getting just as much enjoyment out of it the hundredth time as I did the first.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

And the plot was a complete copy of Indiana Jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull. The soundtrack was also very stupid, the entire movie didn't even have 10 songs and all the songs that were in the movie, no one would even know because they're so old, in fact, they're probably from even before 2008 or 2007! They should put songs in there that people actually recognize like maroon 5 songs and LMFAO songs! I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I regret watching it and i will never in my entire life regret typing this online review. WORST. COMEDY. EVERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
649,LudMonaco,"""The anarchic comedy""",9,19 August 2015,"The film is a good demonstration of how masses can be easily manipulated; a red highlight to man's pride and desire of controlling all; a call to open our eyes on our blind walk, guided by blind leaders; a shout for attention to life's undervaluation and an echo that whispers the castration of men's true wills All those issues are projected in the film, although there's no shedding of tears Monty Python And The Holy Grail shows us how to deal well with the sad facts of life: Having a big laugh at it all! The film is a 1975 British comedy, written and performed by the sarcastic group Monty Python, and directed by two of its members, Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones. It draws a satire on power and parodies King Arthur and The Knights of The Round Table legend. The satire starts from the chosen legend itself and as its name suggests, the table has no head, evincing that everyone who sits there has equal status. Although in the film, King Arthur goes dictating orders and affirming his position to everyone. The movie imposes a cynical tone from the initial title of credits, until the last minute of it. Monty Python And The Holy Grail starts with King Arthur, riding an imaginary horse, accompanied by his squire, who bangs two pieces of coconut in Nordic lands, making the sound of a horse ride. Arthur recruits his knights of the round table, including, Sir Bedevere The Wise, Sir Lancelot The Brave, Sir Robin The Not-Quite-So-Brave-As- Lancelot and Sir Galahad the Pure, together they go on the quest for the Holy Grail. They build a ""Trojan Rabbit"" and try to sneak into a French castle, but they forget to hide into the rabbit and fail. Arthur then decides the group should separate to seek the grail. Their separated journeys are totally absurd, plenty of strange creatures and ridiculous obstacles. The plot is gag's restless but we never get enough, one turn overcomes the other, with a really smart and anti-classical style. The English humour travels from the banal weather issue to the monarch state, although the way it's played provokes universal laughter. The script has a ""classic"" anti-structure, a style emerged in Europe after the WWII. It's got incoherent realities, extravagance and exaggeration, obviation of formal principles to ridicule the issues and express with clarity revolutionary ambitions. The narrative is constructed by random, fragmented and chaotic events, full of coincidences, starred by characters deliberately incoherent and usually symbolic, and it also has clear influences of Expressionism, Dadaism and the Theatre of The Absurd. In Monty Python And The Holy Grail, we see characters talking to the camera and also referring to other characters not by their names, but by the scene they played (""There is the old man from scene 24""); actors comment about their acting in the middle of the film; an intermission is called right when King Arthur is crossing The Death Bridge; the medieval age plot is absurdly connected to the 70's sub-plot; but in the end, it all contributes to create an absurd and chaotic situation which goes totally coherent with the film's main target: the incoherent way we live.

The Holy Grail belongs unfortunately to the first sphere. (and suggesting to watch Space Balls instead of it, as I read in another comment, is not a solution: it is pure silliness as well!) Monty Python (so as Mel Brooks, who seems to have forgotten it ) knew very well how to make people laughing with surrealism, so they are not to blame for this forgivable and forgettable little sin.What is to blame is that we should have forgotten it, and on the contrary I found with surprise that this bad film ( I won't add about it anything more than the many not-satisfied comments say ) is underlined and appreciated.Of course I remain convinced about this thing: Monty Python knew how to make people laughing, and they surely ( in their own ) still know it: that's the reason why if they saw their movie now, I'm sure they would not laugh at all!",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

The actors in this film are fantastic as many of them are forced to play many different roles. The stand-out performance in this is Graham Chapman. He was so good and it was hard to believe that he was dealing with alcoholism at the time. The Python regular shouldn't be ignored either as they were fantastic.10/10",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
658,louis-bd,Announcement for the Monty Python's fans: look at the review to discover one of their crazy thing!,9,31 October 2014,"''And now for something completely different.'', ''It's!''Two of the most popular cues of the Monty Python's Flying Circus. But they don't appear in this film: ''Monty Python: The Holy Grail''.The film was mainly shot in Scotland with two castles: the Doune castle and the Castle Stalker. The film was directed by Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam. It was produced by Mark Forstarer and Michael White. It was released in London the fourth April 1975.The casting is made up: John Cleese, the crazy; Terry Gilliam, the animator; Michael Palin, the kind; Terry Jones, the effeminate; Graham Chapman, the serious and Eric Idle, the singer. There is also other people like Carol Cleveland or Neil Innes who play supporting actors.The film parodies the quest of the King Arthur and his knights of the round table for the Grail. Arthur gathers together knights to join the court of Camelot. They are putted by God in charge of looking after the Holy Grail. After a defeat against French soldiers, Arthur decide to break up the group. Every knight is confronted with an ordeal. After, they meet again and meet an enchanter who steers the knights towards their goal...This film is a comedy filled of absurd components like horses replaced by coconuts maybe brought by a swallow, a killer rabbit or the dreaded knights who say ''Ni!'' and adore shrubberies.One of the particularity of the Monty Python's films is that every Monty Python plays several roles. For example, in the same scene, John Cleese plays at the same time Lancelot and the enchanter.Personally, I love that film. I am fond of Monty Python. I have seen all of their films and episodes of the Monty Python's Flying Circus. I have seen their show in July 2014 and they haven't lost their comical power. It's a parody but it isn't satirical. The company of Monty Python is a keystone of the British humor.It's why I recommended you this film if you like the comedy and specially the British humor. A excellent film to savior with egg and bacon or egg bacon and Spam or Spam bacon sausage and Spam or Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam Spam baked beans Spam Spam Spam Spam or Lobster Thermidor aux crevetes with a mornay sauce garnished with truffle pate, brandy and with a fried egg on the top and Spam. And now, I take my leave. And don't forget: ''Always look on the bright side of life''.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
659,kayhood3293,Love this movie,9,2 July 2015,"My dad introduced me to this movie and at first we only got to watch the first half. A few months later we watched it all the way through and I was hooked. I love the British humor and it is definitely not a boring movie as it is filled with innuendo and good humor. I will say that British humor is not for everyone, but I absolutely love it! The way it is laid out can be a little confusing at times, and some random things do happen but it all seems to make sense at the end of the movie, but what movie doesn't do that. Or any TV show for that matter ha ha!There is a bit of blood in some scenes that may annoy some people but when you see it you can obviously tell that it is fake, what with how they portray it. But, all in all, love this movie!",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

He is questing for the Holy Grail and along the way he meets his knights for the round table. They also encounter a somewhat gay prince, the French, a wizard, a troll bridge, a very pain-tolerant knight and a man-eating rabbit. This movie involves lots of crude humor and some slapstick humor. There is a small amount of very fake looking blood. I would recommend it for 12 or so and up. It is ridiculously hilarious and is counted as a classic movie.

Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a movie that was introduced to me in an advanced English class in high school (the ""end of senior year/last day of class) treat""). I could not believe I had never heard of this fantastic movie! The twists and quirks DO NOT END. Ever tried to straighten out a slinky? Perfect parallel comparison to The Holy Grail. There are spoofs on and references to: religion, peasants, Robin Hood, Camelot, King Arthur, knights in general, and enchanters. This is a movie I have watched four times since that day in high school, and twice since I bought it for my boyfriend, Andrew, as a birthday gift (yesterday). The movies I can stand to watch twice are rare and few between. Monty Python and the Holy Grail, however, I could watch twice in one sitting (with an intermission, of course ;) ).

I watched the flying circus series in my youth (not realizing they were all reruns) late at night (along with Benny Hill and others) and thoroughly enjoy the late 60's and early 70's British humor.From the ""Nights of Ni"" (shrubbery) to ""Tim"" the wizard (what is your name?)...... The taunting French (I fart in your general direction), riding on a horse (banging two empty halves of coconuts together)..... I can recite most of the great lines cleverly written into this classic.I (of course) own this movie in every currently watchable format and highly recommend to anyone who has never seen the film to watch it from beginning to end and be prepared to recite lines from it in your every day life.

668,geekypopcorn,One of the best comedies of all time,9,5 September 2016,"The story line of this movie is a bit simple; King Arthur travels the country to find knights who will join him at the Round Table in Camelot. Sir Bedevere, Sir Lancelot, Sir Robin and Sir Galahad are introduced in the story one by one. When the party is about to enter Camelot King Arthur decides that Camelot is a silly place and they almost disassemble but then God appears and send them on a sacred quest: to find the Holy Grail. After every knight goes on an individual adventure,they are reunited to face different perils, a wizard, a killer rabbit, yes a killer rabbit, (photo) isn't it adorable? a monster with many eyes... Their quest comes to an end when the police intervene, yeah, the police, modern police. Strange, isn't it? specially for a movie set in tenth century England. But the most important thing in this movie isn't the plot, or the historical inaccuracies, which are always few and very calculated in Monty Python's productions, the important thing is the comedy. Monty Python is comedy, period. Intelligent, acid, sarcastic British humour. Some could say that the jokes are silly but that apparent simpleness hides the most incisive and scathing humour. Like in other Monty Python works, some of the jokes conceal political content, often to ridicule the anti-establishment movements repeating their hackneyed slogans out of context. Can you imagine tenth century peasants demanding their constitutional rights? For all that and more Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of the best comedies of all times.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

John Cleese, Michael Palin, Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones and Graham Chapman are all geniuses.From the opening reveal of a finely clad rider not actually riding a horse but skipping to the beat of coconuts to the excruciatingly hilarious anti-climactic ending, this movie keeps you laughing your face off for 80 solid and wonderful minutes.Anyone who dislikes this movie is in serious need of a humour transplant.How can you not find Robin's minstrels; the idiotic guards who have the hardest time making sure ""he doesn't leave""; Lancelot's daring rescue of Galahad from the evil clutches of ""8 score young blondes and brunettes"" who want ""spanking and oral sex""; the witch-hunters who hunt ""witches"" who have obviously refused to sleep with them; Tim the Enchanter (""There are some who call me.....Tim?"") and everything else in this movie hilarious.It makes me cry every time.A straight up 10/10 for this delightful Arthurian romp.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

672,kristof_lantos,A unique spin-off of the Arthurian legend,9,12 March 2018,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a comedy movie set in 10th century England. It is a story about King Arthur and his journey to find the Holy Grail with the Knights of the Round Table. The movie is executed cleverly by the Monty Python comedy group, considering their low budget of $400,000. Instead of creating an unimaginative movie, the group uses their limitations to create comedy. In one scene, the castle guard asks why is King Arthur's squire beating coconut shells together. King Arthur claims that it is his horse. Since coconuts are tropical, the guard rejects his answer and questions the origins of the coconut shells leading to a long and hilarious conversation. Although confusing at first, every plot point connects to one another. An example of this would be Sir Lancelot saving Sir Galahad from temptation, then reuniting with Sir Robin and King Arthur at the forest. This happened right after Sir Robin reunited with King Arthur and Sir Bedivere at the Knights of Ni, after he dealt with the three headed knight. These plot points all connect up, leading to the reunion of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, letting them continue their journey to find the Holy Grail.The movie also executes comedy in a unique way, using incompetence, instead of forced punchlines and one liners. A scene that shows this would be the scene of the Trojan Rabbit. In this scene, King Arthur and his knights created a plan to infiltrate the French castle using a Trojan Rabbit, clearly a reference to the Trojan Horse the Greeks used to infiltrate Troy. But the group mismanages the execution, by sending the Trojan Rabbit to the French before getting inside it, due to Sir Bedivere failing to mention that someone needs to get in the rabbit. Overall, I would rate this movie 9 out of 10, due to its execution on comedy and uniqueness. I would not give it a 10 out of 10 since the ending was anticlimactic and the subplot was not executed well enough.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
673,ishaanghosh,The king of the ridiculous,8,4 July 2018,"""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" is a low-budget, ridiculous, hopelessly anachronistic ride that will still leave you laughing until your insides hurt. Much of the movie's comedy is of the ""random funny thing just happened"" variety, such as the famous credits scene with the ""majestik møøse"", but a careful listener may pick out certain references, in-jokes, and Easter eggs, especially concerning medieval history and culture. In addition to all this, the movie also features amusing dialogue, witty one-liners, and a fair amount of meta-commentary.While the episodic structure of the film and ""random"" humor may well put some viewers off the movie, overall, it succeeds wonderfully at its intent: to be an absurd, funny, and at times surprisingly intelligent comedy.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail

675,jwest-42171,Quest for the Holy Grail of Movies,10,17 September 2018,"Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a comedic parody of the classic Arthurian legends by Monty Python. It is a great movie that is extremely funny.
 Monty Python and the Holy Grail focuses most of the story on King Arthur and his quest for the holy grail. It takes place in Britain. The movie makes jokes of many things including British-French relations and the mystical tales in the Arthurian legends. Monty Python and the Holy Grail takes place during Medieval Europe. 
 While not visually impressive it is not bad looking and has it's own unique style of showing, what looks like animated medieval murals during transitions. My favorite bit is about the Holy Hand-grenade of Antioch. King Arthur uses the grenade to kill a vicious man eating monster, a rabbit, and they explain how to use it in about five different ways.
 Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a great comedic movie that I will continue to watch again and again",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
676,SeeBlind,A Holy Grail of Comedies,9,30 May 2006,"1,2,5 Monty Python. What I basically have to say is wow, what a great film. The story about a knights adventures in Camelot, with his faithful companions,in search of the Holy Grail. The basic medieval story line. With a twist.With a script of a thousand laughs and a memorable cast of characters, it would make us all want to grab some coconuts and start banging' them together. People would grab a calculator and figure out the difference in velocity between an African and European swallow within a second after watching this film.Though low budget, it is very effective and it is placed in that special part of our hearts where we keep killer bunnies and enchanters named Tim.In the end, we all are a little bit wiser from this films lessons and true valued story line. From Minty Python, we learn that even if you get changed into a newt, you can always get better. We all learn the true meaning of life, and friendship through this film, and ultimately that Camelot is a very silly place.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
677,harpyjay,Amazing,9,9 January 2019,The movie was a great comedy featuring medieval characters,Monty Python and the Holy Grail
678,gabebrownmn,'Tis But A Masterpiece,10,17 January 2019,"Monty Python And The Holy Grail is one of the few comedies that are funny before it even starts. Starting in the opening credits there are already several jokes that clearly show the purpose of the film, to make you laugh. The film is very successful at doing this as it has you laughing from beginning to end. The members of Monty Python are considered by many to be some of the best comedians ever and this film is an excellent of why. Monty Python And The Holy Grail is an amazing comedy that is still hilarious 44 years after its release making it a comedy masterpiece.
Monty Python And The Holy Grail is about King Arthur and several knights who go on a quest to find the holy grail. At first King Arthur builds a group of knights for his holy quest. On their hilarious quest they run into several foes such as the French, a deadly rabbit, the bridge of death and several more. All along their quest they will have you laughing at all the comedic conversations and battles.
Arthur, King of the Britons (Graham Chapman) is a king who leads his knights on a quest for the holy grail. His fellow knights Sir Lancelot the Brave (John Cleese), Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot (Eric Idle), Sir Bedevere the Wise (Terry Jones) and Sir Galahad the Pure (Michael Palin) help Arthur defeat (or run away from) many foes on their quest for the grail. The members of the cast work really well together to make this film a work of art that keeps you laughing until the very end. The film is directed by Gilliam and Jones who proved that they can make an amazing film stand the test of time.
The film is an amazing example of how to use music and sound to add humor or intensity to a scene. The costumes and film locations really make the film feel like it takes place in 10th century England. The music before an action scene always fits well with the story. The sound effects, like the use of coconuts to make the sound of a horse, find a way to add humor to every scene. The script is a big reason the film is as good as it is because it is humorous and tells the story wonderfully. The camerawork and effects work seamlessly to make hilarious action scenes that look pretty real.
One scene that exemplifies why Monty Python And The Holy Grail is an amazing film is the ""Deadly Rabbit of Caerbannog"" scene. In this scene good camera work and effects make the battle between the knights and the bunny intense. This is compounded by the sound effects of the bunny's attacks to make the bunny a surprisingly scary foe. At the same time the dialogue between the characters makes a bloody action scene more into a comedy. This scene is a work of art because it is both an intense action scene and hilarious at the same time.
Monty Python And The Holy Grail isn't a perfect film though. It's biggest flaw is the fact that it is over 40 years old. The age definitely shows with the lack of modern special effects and low camera quality. If you like to watch films because of their jaw-dropping special effects and super high definition video then this film isn't for you. However, if you can get over the films obvious age then you will enjoy the comedic masterpiece that is Monty Python And The Holy Grail.
The Monty Python group has made many more films and television broadcasts than just Monty Python And The Holy Grail. Monty Python is a british comedy group that made it big with the BBC series Monty Python's Flying Circus. This series is much different work than the film Monty Python And The Holy Grail because it's a TV series spanning forty five episodes instead of a 92 minute film. The change in format however made little difference in Monty Python's ability to make amazing comedies as after their BBC series ended they made several great films.
With Monty Python's work in films like Monty Python And The Holy Grail they have cemented themselves as one of the most influential comedy groups. Graham Chapman's stellar performance as King Arthur alongside the rest of the cast drives the film forward while the great sound and visual effects take care of the rest. Everything in Monty Python And The Holy Grail fits together perfectly to make the film a real comedy masterpiece.",Monty Python and the Holy Grail
