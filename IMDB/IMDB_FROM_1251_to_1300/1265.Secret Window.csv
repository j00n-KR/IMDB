0,Leofwine_draca,Real bad Stephen King adaptation - why all the praise?,3,11 December 2016,"This is a rubbishy, cheesy B-movie that attempts to ride on the coat-tails of other 'twist' ending movies like THE MACHINIST and FIGHT CLUB, borrowing liberally from those two movies without ever taking itself seriously enough to be effective. As a result the film is goofy and predictable throughout, hindered by another 'kooky' turn from the increasingly stale Johnny Depp, and a script that spoon-feds the story to mindless viewers in an attempt to pull the rug out from under their feet. The problem is that the twist becomes startlingly obvious about ½ way through the film and the final scenes, while attempting to portray psychological disturbance, end up more like a silly rerun of the Michael Keaton flick MULTIPLICITY than the serious drama that they want to be.While Depp is boring, he's supported by a lot of decent actors. John Turturro makes for a suitably imposing bad guy and Charles S. Dutton, well he brings the screen to life as always. One of my favourite performances comes from Timothy Hutton, whose presence is a nod to another Stephen King adaptation, THE DARK HALF, in which he starred. The only bad thing is that he serves as a reminder that even this King novella is a rubbishy, half-developed version of an altogether better book and better film. Meanwhile, the less said about the disappointing Maria Bello, the better.While this film does start off quite well – despite the predictably of yet ANOTHER King offering with a weirdo writer as the leading character – things fall apart so badly as the story progresses. David Koepp, reasonably efficient in the past, lets the cabin-in-the-woods setting get to his head and poorly experiments with camera angles in an attempt to recreate the success of THE EVIL DEAD. There's a ludicrous rip on THE SHINING at the film's climax and, while it deserves kudos for going through with a murder that I thought it never would, it's clear that this should have had a harder rating, with severed heads and arterial blood to add to the horror aspect. As it is, the horror is lukewarm and rehashed, and aside from one good car-over-the-cliff scene, it sucks.",Secret Window
1,SnoopyStyle,spooky without the intensity,6,2 January 2016,Writer Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) is struggling getting divorced from his wife Amy (Maria Bello) after she cheated with Ted (Timothy Hutton). He's alone in his remote cabin when mysterious stranger John Shooter (John Turturro) shows up. He accuses him of plagiarism and starts threatening him. Sheriff Dave Newsome is nonchalant. Mort hires private investigator Ken Karsch (Charles S. Dutton). He needs an old magazine to prove his case and then somebody burns down his house.This one is spooky without much intensity. Depp is playing normal and Turturro is doing super creepy southerner. There is obviously a twist coming and it becomes a waiting game for the movie to reveal it. The twist is good enough but it is barely a worthwhile wait.,Secret Window
2,claudio_carvalho,Ending Is The Most Important Part of the Story,7,9 January 2005,"Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) is a lonely successful writer is a process of divorce of his wife Amy (Maria Bello), who is living with the new mate Ted Milner (Timothy Hutton). The life of Mort changes when he is accused by the Mississippi redneck John Shooter (John Turturo) of plagiarizing his tale ""Secret Window"". Shooter threatens Mort and his friends, in a story with a surprising end. ""Secret Window"" is a movie where the characters are slowly well-developed, but with a great conclusion. Unfortunately the darker conclusive last scene was deleted, and there is no explanation for such procedure. It seems that the director forgot that ending is the most important part of the story. Anyway, this movie is a worthwhile entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Janela Secreta"" (""The Secret Window"")",Secret Window

4,lee_eisenberg,Why Johnny Depp is probably the most interesting actor of his generation.,7,2 December 2005,"Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) is a writer having trouble coming up with an idea. Finally, he comes up with something. The only problem is, a stranger named Shooter (John Turturro) accuses Mort of plagiarism. Naturally, Mort wants to prove himself innocent - but then, that's where the movie becomes apparent as a Stephen King story. You may never trust yourself again after seeing this movie.Movies like ""Secret Window"" (as well as ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", ""Ed Wood"", ""Sleepy Hollow"", ""Chocolat"", ""Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"", ""Finding Neverland"" and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"") show why Johnny Depp may be the most interesting actor of his generation. Maybe anyone could have given Mort the mannerisms that he exhibits, but Depp puts his usual impressive spin on it. After watching this movie, you may want to think twice before even attempting to write anything.",Secret Window
5,jboothmillard,Secret Window,3,16 October 2006,"From director Dave Koepp (Ghost Town), writer of films such as Jurassic Park, The Paper, Mission: Impossible and Spider-Man, and based on the work of Stephen King, I remember seeing this once before and thinking it was terrible, I thought at least one more viewing was necessary. Basically famous mystery writer Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) is having problems with writer's block and getting an unfriendly divorce from wife Amy (Coyote Ugly's Maria Bello), and now a new problem has cropped up. A stranger calling himself John Shooter (Transformers' John Turturro) shows up on his doorstep claiming he stole his story, Secret Window, and copied it all, but he says he can prove the man is wrong. Mort digs around for a magazine that wrote about the book that he claims was written two years before Shooter's copy, but as the search as slow the mysterious man is becoming more threatening. First Mort's dog is killed, a couple of people die, and the divorce proceedings are getting ugly, but no-one seems to be doing anything substantial to stop the stranger's threatening behaviour. Eventually it becomes apparent that Mort is not only an insomniac, but he has a bad case of mental health where he is schizophrenic, so in the end it is obvious that Shooter is another personality of Mort. Also starring Timothy Hutton as Ted Milner and Charles S. Dutton as Ken Karsch. Depp is a little dull, and it is a question why he accepted the part, I will admit the story was a little gripping for the first hour or so, but after that it starts to fade into ridiculousness, so overall, a daft suspense thriller. Adequate!",Secret Window
6,ccthemovieman-1,Depp & Turturro: Now There's A Pair!,8,21 July 2006,"I liked this film but never bought it, even previously-viewed which I usually do if I enjoy a film and plan on seeing it multiple times. Thus, I guess what I'm saying is the film is entertaining but not that great to run out and purchase. Rent it, first, and see what you think.People who are in love with Johnny Depp will buy it, regardless. Depp, as usual, is interesting and plays a strange character. His character, ""Mort Rainey,"" and the film in general are interesting right from the get-go up to the surprise ending.Speaking of guys who play wackos, John Turturro does that in here, too. He plays a very creepy character. That was good casting, having those two guys in the same film! Also in here are Maria Bello, Timothy Hutton and Charles S. Dutton.I wonder if I did go back and watch this several times, if I would (as I think I would) find some gaping holes in the story. Perhaps it's better just to play dumb and enjoy the movie and not worry about its credibility.",Secret Window
7,rmax304823,"Mr. Torrance, This is Mr. Sheldon.",5,28 December 2004,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" forced us to identify with Janet Leigh's character from the very beginning. She's in almost every frame, and we have a lot of shots from her point of view. This, her murder, roughly two thirds of the way through the film came as a real shocker.In ""The Secret Window"" we are caused to identify with Stephen King's manifestation in Mort Raimey, Johnny Depp. That is, we see a lot of things through his eyes. And he talks to himself (ie., the audience). And we are made to feel that injustices are heaped upon him -- he catches his wife in the sack with Timothy Hutton and some backwoods loony accuses him of plagiarism and threatens his life.So far it's rather like Marion Crane in drag. But what would ""Psycho"" have been if Marion Crane, instead of Anthony Perkins, had turned out to be the murderer with multiple personality? That's more or less what happens here. Depp begins as a rather ordinary guy, an author with writer's block, spending the summer in a comfortable old lakeside cabin in Connecticut. He has all sorts of endearing human traits. He's slothful, dresses in a ripped robe, and is doing his best to quit smoking in the middle of divorce proceedings. The persecution by John Turturro, against whom he is legally and physically helpless, trap him into a Paul Sheldon mold, out of King's ""Misery."" But then, following a couple of murders, he begins not only to talk to himself but to visualize his other self. He holds complete conversations with his other self, who patiently explains that he, Mort Rainey, is the arsonist and murderer, and that the Turturro character is only a hallucination. He becomes as nutty as a Granola bar and as violent as Jack Torrance in ""The Shining."" There's even an ax involved, and a replay of the ""Redrum"" device in which ""Shooter"" turns into ""Shoot Her."" The first part of the movie is okay. The production design is accomplished. The many plot holes begin about the time Mort Rainey's dog, Chico, is killed by the loony with a screwdriver. If Turturro's character is made up by Rainey as a way of showing his evil side without having to recognize it, which turns out to be the case, then why would Rainey kill his own dog? It gets more complicated until the end, which yields almost complete confusion. Eating a crop of fresh corn that is growing out of your wife's grave is gruesome but doesn't add to the plot or tell us anything we needed to know.As King's movies go, this one is photographed and acted well, and it looks right. But there is a crazy logic to, say, ""Misery"" that's lacking here. I can understand a writer being trapped in a fruitcake's bed with a pair of broken legs, but I can't begin to get inside Mort Rainey's skin. Mediocre.",Secret Window
8,BA_Harrison,Spoilers what spoilers?,5,3 November 2013,"I've ticked the 'spoilers' box, but this review doesn't really contain any spoilers: that's because even a total numb-nuts with the IQ of a flannel could figure out that Johnny Depp's character in Secret Window is a few sandwiches short of a picnic—a schizophrenic whose damaged psyche has created a murderous alter-ego. It's a twist telegraphed so clearly right from the start that it's almost impossible to spoil, although further evidence of Depp's nuttiness is liberally sprinkled throughout for those living vegetables that might struggle with such an oft-used plot device.I've not read it yet, but I imagine that the novella from which this film has been adapted—Stephen King's Secret Window, Secret Garden—bears little resemblance to this film. Writer/director David Koepp's script lacks sophistication and finesse, as does his direction, and despite the involvement of a terrific cast, his film is quite the embarrassment, complete with numerous dumb plot turns and woeful CGI trickery. As a fan of bad movies, I actually had quite a bit of fun with this, particularly with Depp's typically quirky performance (hence my middling score of 5/10), but I wouldn't blame King if he sought out all those involved, killed their dog, torched their home, stuck a screwdriver in their head and buried them in his garden as a warning to others!",Secret Window
9,moonspinner55,Another dud from Depp,5,31 July 2016,"Disingenuous thriller, expanded from a Stephen King short story by David Koepp, who also directed, involves a novelist with writer's block, living alone in a rural cabin, accused of plagiarism by a sinister man from Mississippi named Shooter. Johnny Depp has the lead, looking fashionably shaggy and unkept, yet this is a vehicle that barely taps his talent. The horrific events which pile up around the author are meant to be morbidly amusing, but is there anything more reprehensible than killing the pet dog for a quick shock? Depp's dryly disengaged manner and funny-paranoid looks have to carry this a long way, though he's given a bit of help from a good supporting cast working from next to nothing. The 'twist' at the finale (juiced with special effects) is so derivative it is essentially predictable, while the tag at the end is perhaps too cheeky. All play and no work makes Depp a dull boy. ** from ****",Secret Window
10,blanche-2,not crazy about it,6,3 April 2011,"""The Secret Window"" from 2004 stars Johnny Depp and is adapted from a Stephen King novel. David Koepp directs. Koepp wisely lets Johnny Depp loose on the subject matter, and his performance is truly what counts.This film is a kind of combination horror and mystery, about a writer, Mort (Depp) in the process of getting a divorce, who lives alone in a cabin as he works. A man named Shooter appears and accuses him of plagiarizing a story he wrote, except that Mort changed the ending. Stoner wants his original ending put back in.Things weren't bad enough, but now they get really bad. Mort's story predates Shooter's, so he wants to get the magazine in which it first appeared. Suddenly, there are deaths and fires as Shooter lets Mort know that he means business and that no one will stand in his way.Depp does a terrific job, and he's surrounded by some good people: Len Cariou as the sheriff, Charles Dutton as his attorney friend, Maria Bello as his soon to be ex-wife, and Timothy Hutton as her boyfriend, and John Turturro as the mysterious Shooter.The convention the film uses may have been original in 2004, but it isn't now, and it's easy to figure out. The whole purpose of watching is Depp, who is at times frightening, emotional, and funny in the role. We truly see a man who is questioning his sanity and looking for answers.Not as big a movie (or as good a story) as The Green Mile or Shawshank. If Depp weren't in it, I wouldn't have watched it.",Secret Window
11,Quinoa1984,"a fairly guilty pleasure of a King-adaptation; you've seen it before, but it still entertains",7,5 August 2006,"Secret Window shares characteristics with some other Stephen King stories (The Dark Half, possibly a better film than Secret Window, springs to mind as it's also about a writer and problems with 'authorship'), but it benefits from having Johnny Depp in the lead. His role elevates it from being what could have been an elevated television movie. Not just him but John Tuturro as well, who can act creepy in his sleep, who make such predictable material watchable and even funny at points. Depp is right at home playing a conflicted everyman here, as an author who's being accused by another 'writer' named Shooter (Tuturro, monotoned with a Southern accent) of plagiarism. While that case sort of flounders, Depp's character deals with an ex-lover (Maria Bello), and some very strange occurrences that start happening after Shooter's appearance including a dead animal, and other 'goodies'.If you don't see the ending coming a mile away, maybe you might see it by a few feet, if that makes sense. As the film leads towards the climax, you might think to yourself 'oh, that old gag' in terms of a twist in the ending. And, in fact, the very end is probably the worst part of the movie even with its tongue-in-cheek. But the pleasures of watching Secret Window are in seeing what Depp and director/co-writer David Koepp do with the material in those first couple of acts, where the King material is at its freshest at seeming 'realistic' in parts, wondering where the real horror might spring out of. Some of the amusement comes in just watching Depp maneuver in near dialog-less scenes- or in his little sarcastic quips- as he tries to break writers block or has little to do in his cabin by the lake. It's not one of his best performances, but you want to keep watching him anyway, especially when he interacts with Shooter and as certain elements of the story become clearer. It's formula that doesn't totally insult the audience, and it was worthy of a screen treatment with this cast and filmmaker.",Secret Window
12,wes-connors,"Go to the Mirror, John",7,1 September 2008,"The less you know about this film before seeing it, the better. It's (still) a thoroughly enjoyable (psychological) thriller, thanks to the presence of Johnny Depp (as as Mort Rainey), and solid, suspenseful direction from David Koepp. I enjoyed watching it a second time, with Mr. Koepp's commentary track. I appreciate the opening hotel ""interruption"", but was confused about what was going on, and how it related to the unfolding drama. I started to think the ending through fairly early (unfortunately).I thought the significant edition of ""Ellery Queen"" would have been easy to find. A little store in Burbank has all those old issues. Admittedly, Depp's character is nowhere near Burbank; but, he had a laptop, and could have found a copy on eBay. Hey, wouldn't it have been cool to have him discover EVERY copy of that particular issue was unavailable? THEN, he could have a closet full of them revealed near the end! This, or something like it, would have distracted my from predicting the inevitable. THAT being said, ""Secret Window"" is excellent looking. The ""Johns"" perform well, and the writer's neuroses ring true.******* Secret Window (2004) David Koepp ~ Johnny Depp, John Turturro, Timothy Hutton",Secret Window
13,Coventry,Simple yet effective thriller,6,31 January 2005,"For some reason, everything that Stephen King ever writes is automatically turned into a movie. This sometimes results in essentials milestones (like ""Carrie"", ""The Dead Zone"" or ""Misery"") but mostly these adaptations simply become meaningless entertainment (""The Night Flier"", ""Children of the Corn""). Secret Window floats somewhere in betweenIt's an efficiently elaborated thriller without much pretension, yet with enough compelling aspects to make the audience feel uncomfortable at times. And sometimes that's all there is needed. Secret Window tells the familiar story of a slightly eccentric author suffering from a severe writer's block. He lives retired in a remote cabin where he does little else than sleep all day and wander around in a fusty dressing gown. Still upset over his cheating wife wanting to divorce him, Mort is visited by an uncanny Mississippian redneck claiming he stole the story of his most successful novel. The guy, John Shooter, begins to pressure and stalk Mort into modifying the ending of his novel. Praiseworthy elements about this film merely are the acting of the entire cast and the solid directing by David Koepp. I don't know why it is but every role Johnny Depp plays is a wayward triumph and he plays this seemly routine character with tics and an air like only he could do it. John Turturro is very good as well in a role that doesn't really fit in his repertoire. David Koepp already proved his has an eye for tension in his ""Stir of Echoes"" and with this film he states once again that he's more than just a skilled scriptwriter.",Secret Window
14,michaelRokeefe,Its all based on a good ending.,8,12 March 2004,"Johnny Depp has to be one of the most versatile actors of his generation. David Koepp designs a screenplay out of a Stephen King novella ""Secret Window, Secret Garden"" and puts chills up and down your spine.

He takes to his remote lake house and in the middle of one of his many naps there comes a banging at the door. A strange man named John Shooter(John Turturro) claims that Rainey stole his best story and ruined the ending. He intends to stalk Rainey until he changes the ending or proves he did write it first. Rainey's dog is killed and his house...I mean his ex-wife's house is burned to the ground. Talk about troubles. Rainey is at his wits end trying to prove he is wrongly accused of plagiarism. The twist at the end is clever and chilling.Depp manages to apply a little humor to his character's hellish torment. Turturro is outstanding as the strange and persistent stalker from Mississippi. Charles S. Dutton and Timothy Hutton are notable in support. Maria Bello is hardly challenged playing the role of Amy Rainey.

Yet it's a bit of a one trick pony and difficult to take seriously, while it's also surprisingly bloodless, negating the interest of the potential Stephen King blood-lust crowd. The reveal is something of a cheat given what has gone before, belief of suspension is so stretched to breaking point, you literally should be wondering just what all other characters were doing in the film?!Still, Johnny and John, resplendent with weird hats and hairdo's, give good camera time and save David Koepp's movie from stinker damnation. 6/10",Secret Window
16,jotix100,Child of the corn,7,30 March 2004,"Stephen King has great short stories that are more 'reader friendly' than some of his 500 plus pages epics. That he, and some other writers can write so much with deadlines that must be very tight, is something not for the faint hearted, or for writers that might suffer from blockages. David Koepp has adapted the story to the screen with a lot of feeling for the material.
Mr. Koepp is lucky to have found Johnny Depp to play the blocked writer, Mort Rainer. He is a man at war with himself; the nasty divorce he is going through doesn't make it any easier. To complicate things, his wife doesn't budge in asking for a quick settlement. On top of that, the house where Amy, the stranged wife lives presently with Ted, her lover, mysteriously catches fire. Poor Mort, the peace he is seeking in his lake home doesn't come very easy when a hillbilly type arrives on the scene to accuse him of plagiarism. What's a mystery writer to do? He splits his personality and ends up cooking up some corn! The view from the secret window looks right into the quickly assembled mini corn garden...Polenta, anyone?The best thing going for the movie is Johnny Depp. This is an actor that is always reliable; he delivers all the time. His Mort Rainer makes one wonders about writers in general, and ultimately we ask ourselves, could this be Stephen King going through the pains of not being able to write?
Maria Bello, as Amy, is very effective as the wife who abandons her husband for what could be a potential loser. John Turturro is good, but his Southern accent doesn't sound real, at times. Timothy Hutton and Charles Dutton don't have much to do in the film.This is a film for Stephen King and Johnny Depp's fans.",Secret Window
17,Scarecrow-88,Secret Window,7,3 September 2016,"Johnny Depp stars as an author enduring a writer's block, acrimonious divorce, emotional difficulty with his wife's (Maria Bello) adultery (with Timothy Hutton, whose character is from Tennessee and inserts himself in their affairs much to Depp's dismay), losing his beautiful sunny suburban home to her which is responsible for his exile to a woodsy cabin away from city matters, and a visit from a Mississippi, black hat hick named John Shooter (John Turturro) at his doorstep claiming, ""You stole my story."" Shooter insists that he ""fix the ending"" which reflects on what a broken wounded man does to the woman he loves when she betrays him. Bello didn't exactly like that particular story. Depp has yet to sign the divorce papers which has the wife and her lover constantly nagging him. Meanwhile Depp continues to receive visits from Shooter wanting right to be right, while Depp tries to prove to him that he never stole that story, trying to get his body guard (Charles S Dutton) and local county sheriff (Len Cariou; The Lady in White) to look into who this character is, wanting the intruder to leave him alone. The house is burned down, dog is found dead with a screwdriver stabbed in it, and anyone poking around in the affairs of Shooter wind up more than a little worse for wear. This has a rather silly ending (the sheriff vows to find the bodies, yet he doesn't contemplate looking in the recently grown cornfield at the side of the cabin right outside Depp's attic office secret window), but Depp is so much fun as the oddball with disheveled hair, ripped-shoulder robe, emptied Doritos bag along with a wrinkled pack of smokes, fridge of Mountain Dews, and companions to chat with including dog, Chico, and himself. Lounging on the couch and worrying about Shooter, as well as, dealing with Bello and Hutton keep Depp busy...and might just send him over the deep end. Depp even swats a fly at one point and deals with a sore jaw: two little additives to the character among many that make him a treat. Ultimately the adultery/betrayal is the catalyst that drives Depp to dissociative personality issues...Depp having a conversation with himself (literally visually presented impressively) is particularly a highlight of this. Turturro popping up as quite the Southern drawl antagonist, typically upon Depp unexpectedly, is also a hoot. The insurance meeting, with the female attorney going through her own divorce, as Depp, Bello, and insurgent Dutton awkwardly go through the details...Depp having an ally with the divorcée across the room as the other two squirm is most amusing. Director Koepp has an inquisitive yet sweeping camera, and he's given the luxury of following a curious, charismatic, and wonderfully eccentric Depp who boasts a unique leading character. Stephen King's presence can be seen all in the details of the character and his *alter ego*. The main cabin on the lake setting is idyllic and claustrophobic with the mystery of Shooter (and where he might be or when he'll show up again) always present during Depp's exploits. Depp representing the unwelcome cut outsider isn't any more apparent than when the sheriff takes to knitting to help with his arthritis while he wishes to file a complaint about Shooter.

It has a decent reputation but not the kind of reputation that made me wanted to watch this movie right away.It's a really solidly written genre story by David Koepp himself, based on the Stephen King novel. David Koepp of course always has been a more than capable writer but with this movie he also shows once more that he can direct.It's has a dark suitable atmosphere, despite not being ever really a scary movie, at least not a way you would expect from a movie based on a Stephen King novel. It has a good mysterious story though and features some good genre elements. The concept of the entire movie is pretty strong, despite perhaps not being too original on its own in the core. The movie its twists are all well written but they just aren't all too surprisingly. Still the movie has a totally original and fresh feeling all over it, due to the directorial approach and the fine acting performance from lead actor Johnny Depp. It also provides the movie with some relieving fun and humor elements. No, it doesn't make this movie the finest example in its genre but luckily the movie has more than enough other qualities.Johnny Depp normally he is only at his best in Tim Burton movies but this movie he's in good old top form as well. It was also fun to see John Turturro in a totally different role for a change.Yes it's different and differently constructed than most other genre movies and therefor I feel that this movie is perhaps a bit misunderstood and underrated.I really don't mind seeing David Koepp directing more movies, besides writing. He makes some good mainstream genre movies, that are yet somehow also original and refreshing in its very own way, despite having all of the formulaic ingredients always in it as well.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Secret Window

I have watched a few movies based on novels by Stephen King; IT, Carrie, The Green Mile, Children of the Corn, The Shining, Golden Years, Quicksilver Highway, Cujo, Christine, and, obviously, this one. Most of them I didn't like, I don't know if that has to do with King's novels, or if the directors screwed the films up, but anyway; Of all of those, this one ranks up there as one of the best(The Green Mile is the best). The plot takes off almost immediately, and then goes slowly for the rest of the movie. I was a little surprised at the slow rate, but, fortunately, at times the plot takes off again and provides some thrills for a short while, but it only last shortly, and once again it gets slow. The acting is all pretty good, there weren't really any of the actors who did a bad job. The film has a magnificent sense of humor, too, and there are a lot of funny moments all through it. The twist is pretty good, there are a few hints at it throughout the film, but I was definitely surprised when it happened. The films climax is also pretty good, though the very end is a little drawn out. All in all, a pretty good thriller, that could have been better. I recommend this to fans of thrillers. 7/10",Secret Window
21,view_and_review,John Turturro Turns in a Nice Performance,7,26 June 2014,"A writer by the name of Morton Rainey (Johnny Depp) tucks himself away in a cabin in the woods to work on a new book after catching his wife cheating on him. There he encounters a man named John Shooter (John Turturro) who claims that Morton plagiarized his work. It is upon this encounter that things begin to go haywire in Morton's life.Secret Window is a psy-thriller. It's not the type to have you at the edge of your seat or have you jumping at every loud noise but rather, it keeps you plugged in from a who-dunnit angle. There is a stranger claiming that Morton stole his work and Morton is swearing that he didn't. As the viewer you're waiting for the layers to be peeled back so that you can know the truth. The movie does well to hold your attention and having Johnny Depp star in it is always a good move. Johnny Depp had just come off of an Oscar year for Captain Jack Sparrow and was still in good form for Secret Window, but in this flick I'd say that John Turturro outdid Johnny Depp. John Turturro played the dry Mississipian with a grudge and he played it well.

It seems so much borrowed that I almost titled my review ""Fright Club"", but then I figured anybody who saw the title and saw the first fifteen minutes of the film would guess the ending.Johnny Depp plays mystery writer Mort Rainey, living in his bathrobe in a house in the middle of nowhere, seemingly horribly resentful about a housekeeper whom he employed in the first place, working at odd hours, sleeping at even odder ones. Then a knock on the door. There is John Turturro, a composite of every weirdo he has ever played as John Shooter, dressed like a Mississippi preacher straight out of American Gothic, with a southern accent to match. And Shooter is angry. He claims that Rainey stole his story and he wants payback. Rainey doesn't take this guy seriously, and figures he is one of the many crackpots that minor celebrities like himself have to deal with every once in awhile. The guy leaves, but leaves his allegedly purloined story behind. Rainey ends up reading it and recognizes it as a near duplicate of his own ""The Secret Window"".The complicating factors? Rainey has plagiarized one time in his career in the past. Also, Rainey is not happy about his impending divorce. He keeps putting off signing the divorce papers although he and his wife have worked out the property settlement. Plus, his wife left him for a lowlife (Timothy Hutton as Ted) who is obviously interested in Mort's soon to be ex partly because of her looks, partly because of the settlement she gets in the divorce. Materialistic Ted is so obvious that you feel Rainey's soon to be ex is not only not very loyal, but not very bright.Well it turns out Shooter is aptly named, although guns are not really his thing. The violence this demanding man commits quickly escalates from first killing Rainey's dog, to torching Rainey's former home now occupied by his wife, to murder. But how could this one man, seemingly not that bright, manage to run circles around Rainey and all he employs to find out who Shooter really is and where he is from? He must have a source of inside information. Is it his wife? Ted? The guy he plagiarized years ago? Somebody else? Watch and find out.Honorable mention has to go to Charles S. Dutton as the P.I. Rainey turns to for insight and protection from this guy. Len Cariou plays the seemingly useless small town sheriff where Rainey lives. I said seemingly.The suspense builds superbly on this one with a score that really adds to the mood. I would probably give this one a nine if not for the ending that seems somewhat borrowed and definitely blue.",Secret Window
23,anaconda-40658,Predictable But Fun.,7,22 May 2015,"Secret Window (2004): Dir: David Koepp / Cast: Johnny Depp, John Turturro, Maria Bello, Timothy Hutton, Charles S. Dutton: Intriguing thriller about that area of the mind that harbours dark secrets that we would prefer to block out. Predictable thriller yet tense, chilling and involving. It stars Johnny Depp as a writer going through a divorce and writer's block. Suddenly John Turturro arrives accusing him of stealing his story. Depp checks it out and the similarities are there but his was published first. That doesn't prevent murder from factoring in. Although not difficult to figure out it still draws us in with the guilty found out in his ""ultimate ending."" Stylish directing by David Koepp who adapts the Stephen King short story successfully. Depp is terrific as a writer struggling with a divorce as well as compiling evidence that proves him innocent to the accusation aim his way. Turturro is compelling as his accuser who makes bad things happen. Maria Bello plays Depp's guilt-ridden ex-wife who will come to find out more than she needed to. Timothy Hutton plays her stereotypical new beau who is never interesting. Charles S. Dutton is also cardboard as an investigator. The ending presents less than thrilling methods of violence that serve merely for shock value than plot benefit. It regards a tortured mind that we attempt to bury in a ""different ending.""

24,The_Void,"Nice, tight little thriller",8,31 October 2004,"2003 was Johnny Depp's year. Of course, he had the biggest role of the year - Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean, which although it wasn't a very good movie; Johnny Depp was undoubtedly the best thing about it. Then, of course, he had a smaller, but no less entertaining role in this critic's film of the year; the fabulously overblown and star studded 'Once Upon a Time in Mexico'. Because of this, Hollywood's coolest leading man has become known, to many people as 'the man who saved 2003', and rightly so in my opinion. But how do you follow up on that? Well, Depp has decided to go about it by starring in this taut little thriller; Secret Window. Secret Window is a story of plagiarism, or is it? The thriller starts off slowly, with John Turturro turning up on Depp's doorstep, accusing him of stealing his story, which is coincidently titled; ""Secret Window"". Initially, Depp dismisses the idea, as he knows he hasn't copied his story; but when the harassment continues and starts to get more serious, Depp has no choice but to confront the situation.Secret Window features two very good lead performances. Johnny Depp is the obvious one; Depp brings class and charisma to all of his roles, and although this role is different to his more recent ones, as he doesn't get to go over the top, he still manages to excel with it, which is testament to his ability as an actor. The other great performance comes from John Turturro. I haven't seen a lot of Turturro recently, and it's a shame as he's a fine actor. He's fine in this too; his performance is suitably malevolent and although you're probably used to seeing him in more wimpy roles; he does the madman thing brilliantly in this one. Where Secret Window really excels is it's plotting and utilisation of tension. The movie is one of the most tense I have ever seen, and there are several brilliant moments that will have you on the edge of your seat; guaranteed. The use of music is very overdone, but it works with the images on screen. Sometimes when a movie's score is as pronounced as this, it can come off as being almost farcical; but the strong score works a treat here. The plot is slow to start, and there are several moments that will have you thinking ""what?!"" or ""Why did he do that?!"", but trust me; once it's over, it all makes sense. Seeing it develop itself is a treat in itself and the ending, with it's lavishly malicious undertones, is absolutely superb.Secret Window is not the finest example of the thriller genre, and there are many elements here that you will have seen before. However, like most of Stephen King's work; it's well worth bothering with and you could most certainly do a lot worse. Well worth seeing in my opinion.",Secret Window
25,zetes,Succeeds besides the fact that you can guess the secret 10 minutes in,7,28 June 2004,"Far too predictable, using a gimmick that has in the past five years or so become as cliché as `it was all just a dream', but Secret Window succeeds despite that. Not that it succeeds much, but it does entertain for a little more than 90 minutes. Johnny Depp gives a fantastic performance as an author struggling with a separation from his wife, as well as with threats from a stranger (John Turturro), a Mississippi farmer who claims that Depp stole his story. Depp is really the main source of entertainment; this may be his best performance yet and, while he won't follow up his well deserved Oscar nomination from last year, he does deserve it. The film was released too early in 2004, and is itself rather forgettable. But Depp is great, playing things half comic, half serious. And the whole film has a sly humor to it that's just irresistible. 7/10.",Secret Window

Mort has a very hot, sexy petite looking wife named, Amy Rainey (Maria Bello),""Thank You For Smoking"",'05, who was caught sleeping in a Motel bed with Timothy Hutton and so Mort decides he wants a divorce. As the story progresses, John Shooter,(John Turturro), visits Mort's cabin in the woods and accuses him of destroying his career as an author.

27,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Good, but this was just a mixture of old Stephen King stories",6,11 January 2008,"I was renting movies tonite and I came across Secret Window, I remember the trailers that I saw a few years ago for it, and figured that it's Johnny Depp and Stephen King, what a winning combo, right? Johnny takes on the most eccentric roles and really turns them into an incredible character. So my mom and I watched it tonite and she absolutely loved it, I however was puzzled, it seemed like just a typical thriller that has to have the big twister ending and also that it just seemed like a strange mixture of Stephen King's old masterpieces like The Shining and Misery. I don't know, it was clever in some moments and also very creepy in some scenes, but I just didn't like how it ended. This was in some irony, Stephen King's own story with himself on plagiarism, he copied off his own stories.Mort Rainey is a pretty famous and successful writer, but he is going through a rough divorce with his cheating wife. But things get even more rough for him when he meets a man, Shooter, who is claiming he has stolen his story, Shooter makes it very clear that he's not going away and he'll do anything to get his way and make a point with Mort. But Mort realizes that his mind is going crazy and that Shooter might be more than meets the eye with his stories and needs to finish some business with his ex-wife and her lover.Secret Window is a good film in general, for a thriller, it's decent. Like I said, I'm just getting a little sick of these endings where it's the ""Oh, my God! I never saw that coming"", and sadly when you've seen so many of these films, you can predict what will happen next. Johnny Depp though, he is still a great actor. He did a good job on Mort and made the film very watchable, he is surprisingly a very good bad guy, since he's normally the hero or ""anti-hero"" in films, it was nice to see a change. Secret Window has thrilling moments here and there, it's worth a look, but I wasn't too excited over it.6/10",Secret Window
28,=G=,Average,6,24 June 2004,"""Secret Window"" is all about Depp as a mystery writer living in a rustic lakeside community who finds himself stalked by a weirdo who is accusing him of plagiarism and nagged by a soon-to-be-ex wife who wants him to sign divorce papers. This convoluted and tortuous film is a jack of all genres and master of none which pulls together moments of drama, mystery, and suspense while heaping question upon question to build a thematic conundrum only to answer it with an unsatisfying conclusion.  With  flashbacks going off like flashbulbs, this cheap ride to nowhere seems to be a waste of some very good acting talent which gets its inertia from King and Depp. With average marks from the public and critics alike, ""Secret Window"" is best saved for later as a TV time killer. Be sure to disengage the brain before viewing. (C+)",Secret Window
29,Rainey-Dawn,Intriguing Thriller,10,27 June 2014,"Good thrilling horror film. One of my long time favorites. It is suspenseful and has a handful of comical moments thrown it to break up all the drama in the film - but definitely not a dramedy (comedy drama).What I liked best in the film was the interactions and entwined relationships of the three main characters: Amy, Mort and Ted. Honestly, the film did not even have to be a horror thriller for me to have enjoyed it because the drama going on between the three characters was quite interesting enough. The movie could have been simply a romantic drama but throwing in the horror-thriller aspect made the film more intriguing and more exciting.Anyone that likes a good thriller might like this film - almost as much as I do.10/10",Secret Window

31,KineticSeoul,Quite a mundane and dry thriller,4,25 July 2015,"Johnny Depp is the one that makes this movie watchable. Overall, this is a pretty mundane and predictable movie. The mystery wasn't all that exciting and it just felt dry to sit through. When I saw this movie when I was in my early teen, I thought thought it was a alright flick. And didn't really know what direction the plot was headed. But watching it now, I don't know how I missed how it would end. It's difficult to anticipate what is going to happen next, when you are so sure what the twist is. So for the most part I was like ""when is it going to get to the twist already"" because this movie seems to be heavily focused on the predictable twist. If the build up was at least more interest or enticing I would have stayed focused. But for the most part, this movie can put you to sleep. It's worth only one watch since you won't miss anything by just seeing it once. And seeing it a second time won't add anything.4.6/10",Secret Window
32,sddavis63,Very Good Movie With An Unexpected Twist,8,13 March 2006,"I like movies that throw me a curve ball that I hadn't seen coming, and since I hadn't read the Stephen King story on which this was based, this one qualifies on that account. ""Secret Window"" stars Johnny Depp (who I'm appreciating more and more as an actor) as Mort Rainey, an author whose personal life is falling apart, and who in the midst of the mess finds himself accused of plagiarism by a mysterious stranger who becomes increasingly violent as the story progresses. Rainey spends most of the movie trying desperately to figure out who this guy is and also trying to track down an old copy of an Ellery Queen Mystery magazine in which the story he's accused of stealing was published before the stranger claims to have written his story, in order to prove his claim of innocence. (For what it's worth, I thought Rainey seemed to have a strangely hard time tracking this magazine down. Clearly he wrote for this magazine; could not the publishers have sent him a copy pretty quickly?) Rainey manages to make what he thinks is a connection between the stranger and the new boyfriend (played by Timothy Hutton) of his estranged wife Amy (Maria Bello) - most intriguingly the stranger is named John Shooter, while the boyfriend is from a town called Shooter's Bay.The link seems plausible - the two clearly don't like each other - which is why the ultimate ending came as such a surprise to me. Without giving anything away, I can say with the benefit of hindsight that the actual identity of Shooter is hinted at a few times, but I didn't see it coming until it was revealed. My only real criticism of this movie strangely has to do with Depp. Although I thought his performance was very good, I had some trouble buying him as an apparently prolific and successful author. Something there just didn't seem to fit for me. Perhaps Depp just comes across in general as too young to play such a role? I'm not sure I can quite put my finger on what didn't work for me. However, in the light of his good performance, that's a relatively minor quibble.This is a nifty little movie - a good story with good performances and interesting characters. Overall, I give it an 8/10",Secret Window
33,Buddy-51,a mixed bag but fairly enjoyable thriller,6,31 December 2004,"By about a half hour into ""Secret Window,"" I had pretty much figured out what was really happening and where the story was heading. That's not usually a good sign when it comes to films of this type, but ""Secret Window"" still manages to be a fairly efficient psycho/stalker thriller, even with its painfully obvious triple-somersault-with-a-double-back-flip ending.Based on a Stephen King work, the film stars Johnny Depp as a writer named Morton Rainey, a character we may assume who is not too far removed in some ways from the author himself. One day, Rainey is approached by a mysterious stranger from Mississippi (John Turturro) who accuses the writer of having plagiarized one of his stories (published by Rainey under the title ""Secret Window""). Despite Rainey's protests of innocence in the matter, the man, who calls himself ""Shooter,"" starts making life miserable for the young author, who is already struggling with a messy divorce from the wife (Maria Bello) he caught cheating on him in a nearby motel.Thrillers like ""Secret Window"" always seem to be caught between a rock and a hard place when it comes to working out their story lines. Modern audiences have developed such an insatiable appetite for ever more elaborate plot twists and surprise turnabout endings that the writers of these films end up having to compromise narrative plausibility to satisfy the demand. As a result, like most thrillers these days, ""Secret Window"" starts off well then goes steadily downhill, as the plot elements begin to spin more and more out of control and credibility flies out the window.For a good part of the time, ""Secret Window"" is fun to watch, as Depp tries to figure out what it is that this enigmatic stranger really wants. Although the red herrings are not always totally effective, they do occasionally divert us off the tried-and-true path along which the story is traveling. The film is at its best when dealing with the tensions between Rainey, his wife, Amy, and her current lover, Ted, played by Timothy Bottoms. The actors bring a human dimension to what is, after all, a pretty soulless exercise in audience manipulation. Turturro has a fun time hamming it up with his cornpone Southern accent, although he still manages to come across as a threatening and menacing figure from time to time.There's a small window hidden behind a piece of furniture that may or may not hold the key to everything, but it is so confusingly handled in the screenplay that the audience is left scratching its head trying to figure out what it all means. Indeed, that is the biggest shortcoming of the movie's final act; besides being silly, implausible and way over-the-top, it doesn't make the connections it needs to in order for us to understand what's really going on. It's all a game of a thriller, but a game that fails to lay down the rules in a fair enough way so that we in the audience can play along as well. As a result, we feel very much cheated and had by the time the closing credits come crawling by. So, if you go into ""Secret Window"" with your eyes open and your credibility meter shut off, you may wind up enjoying the film.",Secret Window
34,sol1218,Writers Block?,7,2 February 2005,"**SPOILERS** Hard to follow movie, due to it's convoluted storyline, even when you kind of figured out what the ending is going to be. ""Secret Window"" is about a popular author Mort Rainey, Johnny Depp, who's shacked up alone in his country home in up-state New York trying to get the juices flowing in an attempt the come up with a story for new book that he's planing on writing.Knocking at his door is this stranger who came all the way from Mississippi John Shooter, John Turturro. Shooter claims that Mort plagiarized a book that he wrote back in 1997 seven years ago. Mort realizes that he wrote the short story that Shooter claims that he stole from him back in 1994 and had it published in a national magazine, Ellery Queen, a year later in 1995. Some three years before Shooter claims he wrote it. That doesn't convince Shooter who says that he wan't proof, the June 1995 issue of Ellery Queen, or he'll keep hounding Morth until he publicly gives him the credit for the story. At first Mort dismisses Shooter for a disgruntled and failed writer until he finds his dog, Chico, dead under a blanket with a screwdriver stuck in him. Later Morth hears from his wife Amy, Maria Bello, who's in the process of divorcing him, that her house was burned down which Morth rightfully suspects was the work of Shooter, just like the killing of his dog Chico. Mort gets in touch with New York Private Eye and good friend Ken Karsch, Charles Dutton,to find out just who this John Shooter is and if he's responsible for the death of Chico and the arson of his wife's home and what can be done to put him behind bars. Later after Ken came to Morth's home, and checked out the place for any signs of Shooter and left, Shooter appeared and roughed up Morth where he badly bruised his arm. Calling Ken at the motel he's staying at in town about the incident Ken and Mort agree to meet the next morning at a local diner with a witness Tom Greenleaf, John Dunn-Hill, who saw Shooter talking to Mort the day before. The film ""Secret Window"" really starts to get weird now when both Ken & Greenleaf don't show up at the diner and Mort later finds them murdered in Greenleaf's SUV, by Shooter, on Mort's property. Shooter had set up Mort for the murder for both Ken and Greenleaf in his attempt to get him to right the wrong of stealing his story. Later Mort gets through the mail a copy, from his lawyer, of the 1995 issue of Ellery Queen with his story ""Secret Window"", that Shooter says that he stole from him in 1997, torn out! Was Shooter responsible for that too? There's also a sub-plot in the film between Mort and his wife Amy and her lover Ted Miner (Timothy Hutton), who we saw Morth at the beginning of the movie catch in bed together in a motel room. that story seems to morph into the story between Mort and Shooter that in the end leads to murder. Johnny Depp does his best to make the movie work as the confused and a bit psychotic Mort Rainey but just can't pull his act off. John Turturro was good as the mysterious John Shooter and his weirdness was just right for the part that he played. Both Timothy Hutton and Maria Bello were almost as mysterious, as Mort's wife Amy and her lover Ted, as the off-the-wall John Shooter was. The ending of ""Secret Window"" was a bit contrived, it was somewhat of a cross between the films ""Children of the Corn"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"", and left you with the feeling of a sequel, if the film is a major financial success, not far behind.",Secret Window

36,dromasca,In the golden shade of 'Psycho',8,5 July 2004,"Many of the horror stories and films in the last few tens of years have been written and put on screen in the shade of the 'Psycho'. 'Secret Window' is another one of them, and I believe the Master would not have denied it.  He would certainly enjoyed directing Johnny Depp, as he must have enjoyed directing Anthony Perkins. David Koepp is at his first real directing job, but his writer credits include a few blockbusters of the last decade, starting with Jurassic Park. The story is one of the strong elements of the movie, succeeding to be both catching, and realistic, and believable until the end - even if the end was not be as un-predictable as I have hoped. As many of Stephen King's plots, it is located in a peaceful landscape near a lake, but we all know already that this is only the quite scene of the horrors to come. The usual Kings stuff is being given a real good acting treatment by Johnny Depp, John Turturo, and Maria Bello. Maria is better and better from movie to movie, and I expect her to be one of the big stars of the coming years.

Soon, Mort is harassed by this strange southerner who claims Mort stole his story. Mort says he can produce a magazine in which his story appeared before the guy said he wrote the story.

38,Cineanalyst,Shining,8,19 August 2004,"WARNING: SpoilersJohn Turturro accepts roles in independent and unpopular films--he's supposed to be the pure artist. Johnny Depp is more bankable--he's supposed to be the hack. Fortunately, they're both great actors. We follow the likable Depp, terrorized by Turturro's solid character, only to discover that Depp was the multidimensional genius all along. It's more interesting and internal than Jack Nicholson's revelation in ""The Shining"". That's in no small part to Turturro's involvement in creating a clever doppelgänger theme.Director David Koepp has written commercial screenplays, some with intelligent ideas within. Surely, the very commercial Stephen King wishes to bring out some of the ""pure artist"", as well. The commercialism is a man snagged by his wristwatch to an automobile driving off a cliff; the art is a doppelgänger theme full of mirror and window motifs. Art wrapped in a murder thriller; an intelligent idea fully exposed to be the driving force behind the thriller in a satisfying surprise ending. Depp breaking his bathroom window and shower glass is a wonderful balance between the two--full of obligatory tension, while suggesting the psychosis involved.In the beginning, cinematographer Fred Murphy takes the camera inside the secret window, views the setting and protagonist, before going into a mirror. Not until the dénouement do we leave the narrative subjectivity of the protagonist's reflections. There's other inspired photography involving the cabin, including the allusive splitting wall scene. The climax is, of course, a reference to ""The Shining"", another film based on a Stephen King book with personated architecture and a demented writer.",Secret Window

It does remind you of 'Carrie' in a way but this is a man who wants revenge for his ex wife we are talking about!

Johnny Depp is brilliantly wacky in the lead role, but the movie kind of left me with a feeling of ""Meh"" when all was said and done. I predicted the twist ending at the very beginning when it was revealed what was going on, and it was all too predictable for my liking. What really bothers me is, a lot of these types of movies base their success of the twist endings, due to the shock value of it all. In my opinion the twist ending theory has been played out completely, and it's very rare where I am surprised now a days. John Turturro's interaction with Johnny Depp is a hoot, and probably the best thing about this movie. It felt very offbeat for a Stephen King movie, and often I like offbeat, but it didn't really suit it here as far as I'm concerned.Performances. Johnny Depp is fantastic and does what he can to make this movie acceptable. His quirky ways, and his eccentric performance did wonders for the movie. Not only that, he was perfectly over the top near the end. Maria Bello is decent as the love interest, but her part felt a little too thin. John Turturro is excellent in his role. He's not only creep, but somewhat mesmerizing as well. Timothy Hutton and Charles S. Dutton do well in their respective small parts. Len Cariou played an effective sheriff.Bottom line.

43,vincentlynch-moonoi,Decent film but disappointing performance by Depp,7,21 January 2013,"Thankfully, this was not the first Johnny Depp movie I ever saw. If it had been, I might very well have never watched another.There are two things to review here -- the movie itself and Johnny Deep.I actually think the movie -- for this genre -- is fairly good. It's a little predictable. I figured it out within the first 15 minutes -- that Depp is his own devil. But, it's crafted rather nicely and one scene is terrific -- where Depp meets himself as the killer; what's neat about that scene is the number of long takes where multiple Depps show up in the scene, one after another...seamless photography/special effects. And, if you believe in happy endings...well, you'll be disappointed here. But that's what makes this film a little different than many...an atypical ending.Now as to Johnny Depp's acting here, I must begin by saying that while I don't particularly ""like"" the man who Depp appears to be (in real life), I almost always walk away from his films being impressed. Not this time. The most I can say about his acting here is...that he appeared to be physically dirty and sloppy...you know, pretty much as he appears in real life. Another term that might apply -- mousy. But in terms of real acting -- I didn't see much of it here, except, perhaps throughout the last 10-15 minutes of the film. As one critic at the time of release put it, Depp's performance is full of his ""latest set of rattling eccentricities"".On the other hand, the performance by John Turturro was superb, and again, I am not a particular fan of his, but I'm usually impressed when I walk away from a film with him.Maria Bello (as the wife), Timothy Hutton (as his romantic rival), Len Cariou (as the Sheriff), and Charles S. Dutton (as the private dick) all do their jobs. Period. None stand out.Is the film watchable? Very. Just don't expect to be particularly impressed with Johnny Depp's performance here. He does so much better in several other films.",Secret Window
44,tabuno,"Good Performance, Creepy Movie That Fizzles",6,25 January 2019,"14 March 2004. Like John Cusack's ""Identity"" last year, this movie while scary and riveting fizzles out in the end. Johnny Depp offers up another great performance with his development of personal character idiosyncrasies, but the plot doesn't completely deliver. The amazing potential for surrealistic scenes, tighter emotional bonding between characters, and a more thought out climax would have jumped this movie into the classic realm. But in its current form, Secret Window sputters, the intensity emotional identity/bonding is weakened, and the mystery/thriller twist doesn't carry the weight that The Sixth Sense or the Usual Suspects or the Crying Game had.

But strong performances and solid direction raise it up a notch.John Turtturo owns this movie, he is superb. Depp knocks it out of the park again (for the third movie in a row) with his hair a constant mess and usually wearing a battered dressing gown (were these the actor or the character?? You never knew with Depp back then) he is compelling. Charles S Dutton and Maria Bello round out the cast well. David Koepp is more we'll known for his writing (Jurassic Park, Spider-Man, Carlito's Way, The Paper and Mission Impossible than his directing (I only know Trigger Effect without looking) but he does a solid job, and I'm surprised I'm not aware he has directed anything of note since.It's not perfect, for from it, but it is solid and entertaining.

Maybe they wanted to avert the spoiler. But I don't think it would have affected much, because the twist comes at the final segment. The tale of a writer who is in the middle of divorce and now living alone is the lake house got threatened by a stranger, because according to him he stole his story. Followed by many unpleasant events, how he gets out of the trouble told in the next half.Feels just an okay kind. Though Johnny Depp was good. The suspense was good, particularly in the first half, but later it comes falling down. The second half was average, the twist was not interesting enough. After some point, you might predict it, but the point is it was too familiar. I especially did not like the finale, it was like not in detail. Still a watchable film, because of the actor and for decently made. So I think worth a watch if you keep a low expectation.6/10",Secret Window
47,Thanos_Alfie,Interesting and nothing more...,6,7 December 2018,"""Secret Window"" is a Mystery - Thriller movie in which we watch a successful writer who is living in a remote lake house with his dog and tries to write his new book. He tries very hard but he is stalked due to his recent painful divorce. One day a man accuses him of plagiarism and after that, he hasn't only to prove that the story he wrote was the first one but also to fight with his own demons.I liked this movie because of the interesting plot and since it was based on the novel of Stephen King, David Koepp had an easy job to do in the direction. I also liked the plot twists and I believe that was the most important part of this movie which made me feel that I was there too and I couldn't expect what is going to happen next. I liked the interpretation of Maria Bello who played as Amy Rainey the ex-wife of the writer and Timothy Hutton who played as Ted Milner the man who accused the writer of plagiarism. I didn't like the interpretation of Johnny Depp who played as Mort Rainey the successful writer because I have to admit that I expected more from him.To sum up, I have to say that ""Secret Window"" is a good movie to watch with an interesting plot, some good interpretations made by its cast and I am sure that you going to enjoy watching it. If you are a fan of Johnny Depp and you just want to watch this movie because of him then I recommend you not to watch it because you are going to be disappointed by his interpretation. In addition to this, if you are a fan of mystery movies with plot twists that leave you speechless then this is the movie you have to watch.",Secret Window
48,Dr_Coulardeau,Down in Mort Rainey's mental sinkhole,9,7 September 2015,"This film adaptation is too faithful to the short story by Stephen King. The cinema must show in images what has been written in the story. Words call for the imagination of the reader who has to add pictures to the sentences. The cinema must convince the spectator that he or she can enter the story and become part of it, a real witness of what is happening in front of our eyes.The main character, Mort Rainey, a mystery story writer, gets separated from his wife with a lover or new partner on her side, and no one else on his side. Frustration and damnation. He thus, more or less, refuses to sign the papers for the divorce and she does not have the courage to go to court and get her divorce from a judge. True enough the reasons for the divorce would have to be explained and the judge would have to assess the mutual responsibilities to manage the possible post-divorce agreement and distribution of the assets of the now-divorced couple. She of course wants the bread and the butter and even the money collected by the milk lady for selling her butter, in her case the house, a share on the intellectual property and copyright of her ex-husband, particularly a share of the royalties, and a good alimonyMort Rainey lives in a comfortable even luxurious cabin in the distant mountains, next to a small city where he runs his daily errands. But his solitude leads him to some kind of ranting and raving, and since he is a writer he invents a character who is entrusted with his vengeance or revenge on his wife and at the same time to make it appear in his guilty mind as the victimization of himself. For him, the character is real. And that is where the film is weak because we do not see the link between the inner feelings and emotions and frustrations of the main character that give rise and birth to the secondary character who is identified as a farmer of some religious puritan affiliation, in the way he dresses, speaks and refers to honesty and other cardinal virtues generally broken by deadly sins. This secondary character in the film is systematically shown as real and hence not as a character per se, in other words fictional.Mort Rainey thus uses this fantasy to get rid of his lawyer and assistant who had negotiated the divorce agreement that goes against Mort Rainey's immediate interests. Note the main objection from the wife is that Mort Rainey is unreachable when he is in the process of writing a story and since he is successful he is constantly writing stories, so that the wife is frustrated in her daily desire to be loved, to have company, to discuss important and trivial questions that have nothing to do with her husband's characters and stories.We don't see the secondary character emerging from this context so that the burning of the family's house that the wife wants to retain is not clearly traced to Mort Rainey. So that the reaction of the people in the village and the conclusion of the sheriff of the village are not supported by what we have experienced. The sheriff suggests that Mort Rainey from now on goes to a more distant city to do his business and to avoid coming to the village because the people think the same thing as he does: ""We all know what you have done. We cannot prove it. But we do not want to have any contact with you because of it.""It is a shame, as a matter of fact, because that kind of fictional and violent solution to our daily problems is common. We nearly all imagine how we could get rid of an opponent, a competitor, a challenger, though none of us have the imagination and the courage to fulfill the dream. It could have been a major film about daily life, and its daily frustrations, and their daily conflicts and rejections they may cause if we implemented what our sadistic or perverse imagination suggests.Johnny Depp is good at what he is doing but he is not doing what he should have been directed to do, but that implied some opening of the story and the film on non-real elements that should be visible and discriminatable in the vision the film is, in the images the film brings together. We have to see the invisible to believe in it. We have to represent Satan to believe he/she/it exists. And the Lucifer living in the fictional mind of Mort Rainey is not clearly identified in the pictures. The challenger about a short story, John Shooter, is not visually identifiable as Lucifer.Note the funny names of Mort Rainey (dead in some rainy day) and John Shooter (the John of the Apocalypse and the shooter in the story) are not represented as such in the visual image and editing of the film. Too bad because the short story is extremely powerful, especially with the hidden window in the loft of the cabin which is the secret window by which Mort Rainey's imagination is able to go visit other fictional lands that are really made visible to us.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU
OLDER REVIEWThe theme is simple and quite common with Stephen King. He has often used it. A writer becomes suddenly due to some tension in his own life haunted by a doppelganger, his deeper self that he creates like a character in a story and the writer's life becomes a story, a perfect story. The doppelganger does all the writer wants to do, wants him to do for him. It's difficult to tell more without spoiling the story.You will recognize Stephen King's artful suspense when everything looks exactly like it is supposed to look and yet is just a surface that has nothing to do with reality but reality is invisible because it is all inside and when the iceberg tips out of the water it is all so well done no one can see this tip of the iceberg, let alone the iceberg.Johnny Depp is perfect for the job because he can be both extremely disrupted, corrugated or just insane and at the same time, or just a second later, perfectly sane, charming and adorable. He just needs to change glasses or change hats or change his smile because he always smiles from grinning to grimacing via all kinds of lovable smirks. All extremes seem natural to this man who can just shift from one to the other in less than one nanosecond.But altogether and in the end what does this short story turned long feature tell us about the world and life? Not much really except that writers are always living in a crazy world of their own and no one can understand that. They are unbearable in real life. They can have some nice moments but most of the time they live in their phantasms. And you cannot enter their minds. Luckily you can't and don't tell me you would like to. All that leads to dirty divorce procedures and eventually suits. Before the divorce all that leads to having lovers and intimate friends, making the writer jealous, in a way to both escape him and provoke him out of his writer's mind.At the very same time when you are dealing with a real writer who has a genial doppelganger, both genie and genius, the police will be helpless for at least some long, long time, because the police with all their crime scene investigation and their forensics cannot sort out the mind of an author who is not a serial killer and thus cannot be profiled. In fact his crimes are the only way he has to be reborn in a new life and there will be no series in that bloody episode.You should like it if you let yourself go into the story as if it were true, real, life incarnate. And Johnny Depp should be able to make you believe you have entered a completely true and real world. The phantasms are only the cherry on top of the pie and the ice cream for it to be à la mode.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Secret Window
49,zkonedog,King's Psychological Masterpiece Gets Worthy Big-Screen Adaption,9,7 March 2017,"The fact that ""Secret Window"" is based on a Stephen King novella means that it should succeed. However, we have all seen cases where this is not the case. Thankfully, after the first scene of the film, where Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) opens the door to find John Shooter (John Turturro) drawling his iconic ""you stole mah story"", one can tell that this one was made correctly.For a basic plot summary, ""Secret Window"" sees Rainey, a once-successful writer now struggling with the bottle and loneliness after divorcing wife Amy (Maria Bello), accused of plagiarism by Mr. Shooter, who goes on to torment the people involved in Rainey's life as Rainey himself tries to set the record straight.At its simplest common denominator, this is a great film because King is an incredible storyteller. This is such a compelling & mysterious tale that one cannot helped but be sucked into the many different angles of the rich plot line. Kudos must be given to director David Koepp for making sure all those elements are portrayed as well on the screen as they were on the printed page.The acting is also top-notch in this film, with Rainey & Bello having great chemistry as a divorcing couple trying to figure out what the heck is happening to each other. Turturro, however, almost completely steals the show with his ""Shooter"" performance, creating one of the creepier characters ever to appear on film.Overall, then, ""Secret Window"" is an all-time great movie for fans of mystery & psychological thrillers. From the intriguing beginning to the astounding ending, this movie is one that will have you fully invested in the entire experience.",Secret Window
50,filipemanuelneto,"A good thriller, where the end is everything.",7,16 March 2017,"This movie is about a writer unexpectedly accused of plagiarism, after his traumatic and ill-resolved divorce. What could be just an intellectual setback quickly turns into a police case as the writer feels more threatened. We're facing a light thriller with some tension and a good script. But it takes a while to get to the most interesting moments and the first half will seem monotonous, with the conflict between the two central characters slowly becoming more dense. The end, with a good twist, will make up for that. There is a surreptitious link between the importance of film's end and the discussion between the main characters about the importance of the ending in a story.Johny Depp uses an intentional ""I woke up now and I'm hung over"" look to make his character more sympathetic to us. His character have much psychological depth and he manages to put it on screen. John Turturro is his antagonist but, at the same time, he completes Depp's character, insofar as the film relies on the rivalry between them. Turturro made an excellent deep southern accent and used a grim, sinister appearance to look more threatening than dangerous. The remaining cast has more secondary roles.",Secret Window

This is a very slick production, based on a short by Stephen King. Or was it?In viewing this attempt, I could not help noticing that this was more based on the Dark Half than anything else. It was merely a retelling; evidence of King's obvious displeasure at having been under the rigorous restrictions and requirements of contract.Where the Dark Half concerns a Dark Half having been created by the author's dissociation with the pseudonym he'd invented, the Secret Window tells the story of a psychological Dark Half created by the author's dissociation from the guilt he felt over having committed the deeds he committed.It is a different angle, but plays out like the same, tired story.

53,elshikh4,The Secret Window Wasn't Secret !,6,24 October 2008,"Originally it seems like (Stephen King)'s try to marry his previous (The Shining) with (Psycho)! But anyway, as a movie, it got a special personality, and it got a problem too. So let's look into it.Unfortunately, the thing to be seen first is its own secret. I knew it from the very start during the opening credits while the camera zooms in to the mirror to see (Johnny Depp)'s image sleeping. To tell you the truth, I kind of prognosticated it even before I watched it; when I first saw its trailer and knew that (Depp)'s character was a novelist. I'm a screenwriter myself and a professional viewer, so whether I'm so smart and expert, or this movie is a bit lazy!(David Koepp) as its director handled it fine, but OH MY GOD, as its scriptwriter he couldn't pay attention to how he made it the whole time so easy to predict!: All the appearances of (John Turturro) comes after (Depp)'s nap, he is an imaginative author who writes a mystery stories and lives alone so go figure, and the funniest part was (Turturro)'s looks, he seemed perfectly as one character that came out of cheap novel!Not to mention, the connection between (Timothy Hutton)'s city (Shooter), and the stocker's name which assures that (Turturro) was nothing but a representation of (Depp)'s recent anxiety, so the time limit of the stocker's punishment and the divorce's end. Or even the hint of concealed window that no one around knows about it except (Depp).So all the conflict's elements: suspecting (Hutton)'s character, and (Depp)'s being once a stealer for story, looked as weak distraction more than effective steps to make you confused or thrilled. It failed in causing any doubt that Shooter is another man in the first place; it's just the false bruises, or running ghosts that this writer sees mostly in reflective surfaces aka: his own image!Even a twist like discovering killing the wife and her lover from the start would've been better, yet for another hotter movie!It's not what I expect from the man who wrote bunch of the most strong and attractive movies in the 1990s like (Death Becomes Her - 1992), (Carlito's Way - 1993), and (Snake Eyes - 1998). Even his average ones were distinct like (Jurassic Park - 1993), (The Paper - 1994), and (Mission: Impossible - 1996). But at least (Secret Window) is way better than his next one (War of the Worlds - 2005)!The technicalities were dexterous, however the music wasn't scary as it should be. And I couldn't stand the foolish, very premature, using of the camera tricks!(Johnny Depp) knew certainly what movie he was making so, as usual, he utilized it to show and show off his gifts. He tried to ensure what could make this thriller meritorious for more than one watching. Clearly he was enjoying so much with that amount of scenes - nearly the complete movie - where he was alone, talking to his dog or himself, looking like a mess or a sleepy cat (notice his yawn), annoyed by a door's slap, or a bus's noise, hence he made his character attractively human with memorable details, hoping for the surprising irony to hit when the monster appears at the end. Quite a lesson in acting, through another B-Movie, that could be. And a 90 minutes ride with (Depp) yet not his very deep one.Still, there are some good ideas in it: the appearance of (Shooter) comes to threaten the main character in the right time where questions like ""Do I have it, or not?"" can apply to his story / his wife / his talent. And I think by now that Mr. (King) had taught us all fully how spooky a writer who temporarily lost his creativity could transform into. One of its cleverest points was that he got it back when he became one hero of his own. Despite who was that hero, as long as he could get the original unfinished job done (killing the wife), and end the incapacity of its writer. The metaphor itself was brilliant: a hidden window / to release the suppressed. Anyhow, that what could make laughing, accidentally, at (Depp)'s character as important writer, in the witty scene of the sheriff's office, not - by any chance - a self-sarcasm about this mystery being cheap. Because with a structure like this, it isn't. If only everything was as good as this. Especially that cryptic ending!It's another thriller, which can be attractive if you don't catch on its catch early.",Secret Window
54,dfranzen70,Stunning psychothriller,9,8 July 2004,"Based on a story by Stephen King (""Secret Window, Secret Garden,"" from Nightmares & Dreamscapes), Secret Window is about such interesting themes as plagiarism, guilt, love, infidelity ... and mental issues. Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) is an author about to go through a divorce from his wife Amy (Maria Bello, from The Cooler). While Amy has the couple's main house, Mort's in their cabin in the woods, working on his next novel. A strange man named John Shooter (John Tuturro) shows up on Mort's doorstep, claiming Mort stole a story of his - and wanting Mort to set things right.What starts out as a terrorizing thriller slowly transforms into something a bit more twisted, even a bit more sinister. Mort insists to Shooter that his story is older and that he can prove it - he just needs to find the issue of Ellery Queen magazine. Shooter agrees to give him some time, but we know better. We know Shooter's not going to just roll over if he ever sees the magazine. Added to the chaos in Mort's life is his pending divorce from Amy. The ten-year marriage finally ended when Mort discovered Amy and her new beau Ted (Timothy Hutton) in bed at a cheap motel, an incident that's played back for us a few times. To say any more might be giving away too much, but this is certainly not a run-of-the-mill thriller. If you still need a reason to believe that Johnny Depp can really act, please watch this movie and be forever charmed. Depp is magnificent, and it's easy to see that a lesser actor would have floundered in the role. The rest of the cast is basically background noise, but Bello in particular turned in a magnificent performance. But it's all about Mort, how he perceives things, how he reacts to things.",Secret Window
55,kevin_robbins,This is a really clever and well done film,9,25 October 2021,"Secret Window (2004) is a movie I recently rewatched for the first time in a long time on Amazon Prime.

This movie is directed by David Koepp (You Should Have Left) and stars Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands), John Turturro (The Big Lebowski), Maria Bello (A History of Violence), Timothy Hutton (Ordinary People) and Charles Dutton (Alien 3). I always wondered how much Stephen King wrote himself into the main character of this film. The storyline is so smart and intricate and contains fascinating characters. The storyline unfolds so well and the conclusion is tremendous. There's always something a little off and awkward the entire film you can't quiet put your finger on it. The film is really well paced and the kill scenes once revealed are really fun. The cast also couldn't have been better selected as everyone in this was awesome.

Depp plays Mort, separated from his wife and suffering from writer's block in his outback retreat. Along comes a menacing hick (played by John Turturro) who accuses him not only of plagiarism but of changing the ending of the story he has stolen. It all looks very promising entertainment and we might be tempted to forgive the fact that many of the subsequent elements seem to have been hacked from other films, but the final denouement, when the explanation for such an enticing mystery is revealed, left me cold. Using a device that has been better and more convincingly employed elsewhere, Secret Window becomes not a window into a an author's process of character creation but a see-through cop-out. If you're going to have a secret it needs to be worth knowing; Secret Window made me feel the emotional investment of wanting to know the ending was hardly worth the wait.",Secret Window

58,barnabyrudge,OK thriller which relies on a twist ending that will be obvious to genre addicts from quite early on.,5,15 August 2007,"Based on the novella ""Secret Window, Secret Garden"" by Stephen King, this suspense thriller thinks it is much cleverer than it really is. Anyone who has watched many films of this ilk will guess pretty quickly what the twist in the tail is going to be. Having said that, Johnny Depp tries hard to lift the proceedings with his strong central performance, and writer-director David Koepp uses his prowling camera to make some of the eerie moments effectively flesh-crawling. Their efforts do not totally save the film, but they at least ensure it is a passable offering.Author Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) discovers that his wife Amy (Maria Bello) is having an affair, so he tails her and her lover Ted (Timothy Hutton) to a motel where a violent confrontation takes place. Six months later, Mort is living alone in a secluded woodland lodge while Amy resides in their former house, still waiting for a divorce settlement so that she and Ted can start over. Mort is visited by a mysterious stranger calling himself John Shooter (John Turturro), who accuses him of plagiarising one of his stories. To begin with, Mort is merely rattled and a little irritated by Shooter's accusations. But later he comes to live in utter dread of Shooter - especially when the stranger's actions become increasingly violent. Firstly, Mort's dog is horribly killed; then the house where he used to live with Amy is burned to the ground. Eventually Mort is forced to hire a personal bodyguard, Ken Kirsch (Charles S. Dutton), to ward off the increasingly demented Shooter. But the bad guy has an uncanny way of remaining unseen, and only comes after Mort when he is alone....David Koepp writes and directs the film with competence but no real urgency or personal inspiration. The bits that are meant to be jumpy are put together with mildly effective skill, but there's a lot of lacklustre padding between the high spots. Depp is on-screen for virtually the entire movie, and he makes the bitter, lonely author a convincing enough character. His co-stars don't really get to do a great deal - Dutton as the private detective remains on the periphery of the story; Hutton is wasted in an under-written and under-developed role as the wife's adulterous lover. Bello has a slightly meatier part as Depp's unfaithful wife, and she does OK in it without being particularly outstanding. Koepp enjoys setting up bizarre and disorientating camera angles, especially in and around Depp's woodland retreat, and the effect keeps the audience a little off-balance during the film's more chilling passages. One refreshing element is the way the bad guy remains uncaptured at the end - it's mischievous and curiously satisfying to see a villain eluding justice in this era of ludicrous political correctness. Secret Window is a passable spine-tingler, a little too telegraphed it must be said, but perfectly watchable within its constraints.",Secret Window
59,dwpollar,Wasted talent...,3,22 February 2009,"1st watched 2/19/2009, 3 out of 10(Dir-David Koepp): Wasted talent and pretty much a wasted and messed up movie as well, about a writer being haunted and hunted by someone who is claiming he plagiarized his story.(Or is this what it's about?) At least this is how the movie starts. I won't ruin it for those who want to watch the movie, but the twist at the end doesn't make much sense but is consistent with Stephen King's work. This movie was based on one of his short stories, so I guess it does make a little sense. Johnny Depp plays the writer who is losing his wife and is visited by the John Torturro character who is a southerner who insists Depp's character stole his story. Depp's character insists he wrote it a couple of years earlier then his work and therefore he couldn't have stole it. The hunter then takes personal shots at Depp by shooting his dog, burning his house and killing his friends who happen to be on his side. The title of the movie is the title of the short story that they are fighting over, so there really isn't any real secret window. To tell much more of the story would give away the change that comes at the end. The bottom line is that the story really doesn't go anywhere very fast and even Depp can't save this one. The tremendous waste of talent includes Depp, Torturro and Timothy Hutton just to name a few and the movie should be missed by all. The only hint I'll give on the ending for those who want to watch the movie is to watch other Stephen King adaptations and you can probably figure it out.",Secret Window

Is this a spoiler? is it possible to spoil this film? I know that American Psycho, Identity, Fight Club and all those psycho others are in their respective heads so I guess it's Depp's turn. I believe he wanted to buy a holiday house so the $5m or so he was paid for this bumpkin bonkers fest would do nicely. Michael Caine seems to make bad films for the same reason....and so seemingly does Geoffrey Rush.........how else can anyone rationally explain why big name actors make silly little films like this ...I am assuming they have seen a nice house somewhere and want a quick easy way to buy it without spending the savings. How silly is John Turturro in this...like some bad Bugs Bunny cartoon character. I'll put as he would say it: ""Yow stowle mah money"".",Secret Window
64,Jonny_Numb,"""The ending is the most important part""...and the rest is damn good, too!",7,27 July 2007,"David Koepp is a screenwriter by trade who has been attached to projects directed by the likes of Spielberg and De Palma, but is really in his element when directing his own work. ""Stir of Echoes"" brought a sense of human drama to the supernatural mystery of a neighborhood girl's murder; working from Richard Matheson's story, Koepp developed both mystery and characterization in equal regard. In a way, his style is very in sync with Stephen King's quirky characters and small-town facades that portend buried evils, thus the resounding success of ""Secret Window"" (based on a King novella). Author Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) has seen better days: in the midst of a messy divorce and a serious case of writer's block, he is confronted by John Shooter (a creepy John Turturro), an ominous, black-hatted figure from Mississipi who accuses him of plagiarism. His request? Change the ending, or suffer the consequences. Thus sets up a clever adaptation, equal parts ""The Shining"" and ""The Tenant"" (which Koepp cites in the DVD supplements); Depp is, as usual, excellent as the disgruntled, disheveled Rainey, laying bare the character's neuroses and imagination. He is given fine support by an equally great supporting cast: Maria Bello as his ex; Timothy Hutton as his successor; Len Cariou as the arthritic, 70-year old sheriff; and Charles S. Dutton as a private investigator. While ""Secret Window"" hinges on a dual twist (King fans will see one coming, but not the other), Koepp does not treat the film as merely a setup for it; the progression feels natural, and the epilogue is as disturbing as what has preceded it. The director also has a keen eye for black humor that is sometimes surprising in its own 'schadenfraude' way, but plays out cinematically much like King's humor on the page--an outgrowth of unusual circumstances. ""Secret Window"" is a faithful, fulfilling adaptation that should be accessible even to those who don't favor King's prose.",Secret Window
65,ShootingShark,Spine-Tingling Horror-Drama Of Reclusive Writer Menaced By Dangerous Stranger,7,11 August 2007,"Mort Rainey is a writer going through a messy divorce who retreats to his remote country cabin. Alone, he is confronted by an odd man - John Shooter - who claims Rainey has stolen a story he wrote. Is Shooter just a wacko, or is something unnatural going on ?Based on Stephen King's novella Secret Window, Secret Garden from his book Four Past Midnight, this is a gleefully evil little movie with a cool nutty-as-a-fruitcake performance from Depp as the besieged scribbler with a compound-fractured psyche. There's a tasty twist in this tale involving the Turturro character, which the keen viewer will see coming but only in a way that makes the resolution more fun, although writer-director Koepp is cheeky enough to change the ending of the original story (where Mort dies, instead of his wife and her lover) into a big black joke. Depp is wonderful as Rainey - his hair alone is worth watching the movie for - a sort of nice guy self-righteous slob cowardly schizoid tormented soul, and a total one-of-a-kind performance, which balances beautifully with the film's finely-judged tones of light and dark. The four supporting actors are excellent, especially Turturro in the flashy role of Shooter, and Bello, in my view the only leading lady in recent years who looks like a real woman (as opposed to a twenty-ish model) and whose performances are always worth seeing. It would be fair to say that King - a New England writer with a dark edge and an obsessive nature - writes a lot of fiction where the protagonist is a New England writer with a dark edge and obsessive nature (The Shining, Misery, Bag Of Bones, Lisey's Story, many others), but this, like most of them, is a cracking good yarn with great characters and intriguing themes - what is the difference between a lunatic who assumes a fictitious personality and a writer or actor who creates one as part of their job ? A great movie that for me has an odd resonance with Psycho, though an even better double-bill would be with George Romero's The Dark Half (which also stars Hutton), another superb King adaptation about the murky distinction between a writer and their alter-ego creations. Shot in lovely locations in Quebec, and with a fine eerie score by Philip Glass, this is a must for fans of either King or Depp, and a terrific adaptation of a great story.",Secret Window
66,rbverhoef,Depp saves the day,6,23 June 2005,"Director David Koepp has written some nice screenplays ('Carlito's Way', 'Panic Room') and I liked his 'Stir of Echoes'. Here he comes with a thriller based on a Stephen King novel that is not very good but has some qualities. The best quality here is another terrific performance from Johnny Depp. No matter what he does, he succeeds in making a film entertaining even when it should not be.Depp is a writer named Mort Rainey, recently divorced because his wife (Maria Bello) cheated on him. Now he lives in a cottage near a lake, alone, writing his new book. One day a man rings his bell telling Rainey he has stolen one of his stories. Rainy is unaware of this fact and he can prove it; a magazine printed his short story a couple of years before the man, who is named John Shooter (John Turturro), claims he has written his version. Shooter wants to see this magazine before he believes it, causing quite some trouble in the meanwhile.This is a film with a secret, something we understand pretty soon. I will not reveal it, but most people will come up with an idea and find out they are right. Even though it has a secret it plays too much like a lot of thrillers we have already seen. Interesting performances (Bello is pretty good as the wive too) and some dry humor does not change that. There is one other thing I liked. Koepp payed some good attention to what David Fincher did with his 'Panic Room' screenplay, especially with the camera. There are some great shots here and together with Depp they make sure 'Secret Window' is not wasted.",Secret Window

68,triple8,Did not expect a lot and wasn't disappointed,3,29 May 2005,"SPOILERS THROUGHOUT:Johnny Depp, while not my favorite actor deserves kudos for actually making this movie a little bearable. And John Turturro was great as well. So kudos to them. Not much though because Secret Window, while being atmospheric, well acted, and extremely disturbing, was also not very good. Or I didn't find it so. The movie existed in many clichés and a lot of what happens-the building of the plot-was, while at times scary, also almost painfully dull at times. Some examples and many, many spoilers follow:Here it is(in no particular order).Depp sleeps on couch, scary man shows Up, phone rings, Depp sleeps on couch, repeated shots of empty cabin(Depp's), people and dogs start getting killed, Depp sleeps, what is behind This Depp asks(as he sleeps), repeated shots of Depp's cabin, Depp sleeps, cabin shot, another cabin shot, viewer realizes something terrible is going to happen, Depp sleeps, flashbacks(lasting a second or two) Depp sleeps, pages of book scattered everywhere, phone rings, Depp tiptoes up stairs(and sleeps), evil man appears every now and again while all this is going on to repeatedly accuse Depp of stealing his story and kill people. Depp does more sleeping. That's most of the movie.The movie does every so often scare but it is also obvious that is it's main goal. But much of what happens can be predicted and although Depp is a very handsome man, and his cabin very scenic and pretty, it really did get quite dull as we the audience, silently watch, for the umpteenth time, Johnny snoozing and random shots of a silent cabin(which we the viewer know is NOT so silent-for surely Mr. Shooter is in there-somewhere.) I concede Secret Window had it's moments, every so often Depp would come out with a rather funny line that didn't seem to go with the seriousness of the movie but that worked because one got the feeling Depp may not have been taking it all so seriously. But that did change as the movie went on. As all is finally revealed and we get to watch Depp go insane, it IS pretty darn disturbing. Depp is so creepy in this role-I am not going to say it didn't scare because it did, but must it have done so in such an obvious manner? All could have been and was, predicted. Example-OK now the dog is gonna get it, now Depp's friend is gonna get it, etc etc etc etc.And the final twist? Scary yes but wasn't this done already? (And done better-in at least one other fairly recent movie it was actually a surprise.) I hate it when movies have plot twists that are supposed to be shocking and aren't. And it just seems a letdown after what we are forced to sit through. The staged drama, the predictable twists, the long dull periods of nothing, the unnecessary violence and the impatience to get to the twist, even though, we may know what it is, is to much to sit through so when the twist eventually does come, I felt cheated and had a somewhat bad taste in my mouth. By the end of the movie there's barely one person left standing-except Depp. And I wondered what was the point of it all? It could have been a movie of the week or something though I think the talented cast elevated it a bit.I have read some though not many, of King's books, at least not as many as others, a few close friends included. I have not read this book, but have heard that Secret Window, as a book, is actually better, and I have also heard that a lot of King's stuff doesn't translate well to film. I've enjoyed a few of his movies but did not enjoy this one bit. No matter, what the positives Were, I felt the negatives were double. My vote's 3 out of 10.",Secret Window
69,nycritic,Relationship Crisis or One Nasty Divorce Story.,7,25 March 2005,"The second novella to be adapted from the Stephen King compilation ""Four Past Midnight,"" SECRET WINDOW is one of King's adapted stories that while not being great or especially memorable, somehow manages to tell its premise quite chillingly while maintaining itself closer to B-movie status and (equally) true to its dark core.The story is actually quite familiar ground: Stephen King commented that while MISERY depicted a writer being held prisoner by a demented ex-nurse and rabid fan who does unspeakable things to him to ensure her favorite character, Misery Chastain, lives on, and THE DARK HALF introduces a Twilight Zone-ish take on a split personality where another author is tormented by a dangerous man, SECRET WINDOW blends both into what results in ""the perfect ending"" to the missing pages of an apparently plagiarized story. And while the plot is clearly clichéd within every inch of its life, director David Koepp manages to generate some good suspense which allows us to care for this poor chap Mort Rainey (underplayed by Johnny Depp who by doing so makes his character totally human) and fear the rage just underneath John Shooter (a creepy John Turturro), all the while not quite giving us everything in black and white so as to suddenly introduce a left-field turn of events. As a matter of fact, once the ""twist"" arrives, it seems plausible and even expected, but is even more chilling in the inexorability in which it fulfills itself.One thing that works in Stephen King's books are his constant uses of internal dialogues which here is finally brought into a great forefront by splitting Rainey into two separate entities and having them talk to each other in a crucial scene. This only intensifies the notion that Rainey is unraveling as a person and will more than likely fall prey to the darkness that seems to be closing in. It's a technique which isn't used often when adapting his novels to movies and which tends to work against suspense, and finally, someone got it right. It never feels too long a movie even though it runs just shy of an hour and three quarters, and this is due to the deft direction. Good suspense, great psychological horror that comes through an incredibly tired plot, and that's good film-making.",Secret Window

71,Easygoer10,"Perfect for John Turturro, But Ruined",4,20 April 2019,"I'm sure the novel is much better. Obviously, I haven't read it yet, but will. I watched about 30 minutes of this film. I stopped because John Turturro's ""Mississippi"" accent is truly woeful. I mean, it ruins the film. Having grown up in Louisiana for 30 years, with ""stops"" in other parts of the country, I finally settled in New YorK City; Lower Manhattan. I have lived all over the city (4 of 5 Boroughs). I was in the East Village for a year or so, then lived the longest (in 1 spot) downtown on Sullivan St. in Soho for almost a dozen years. It was great. Later, I lived in Queens, etc. I lived in NY City for almost 30 years; I know accents; extremely well. The point being, I really like John Turturrol and Johnny Depp a lot. These 2 are brilliant actors. As I mentioned in the beginning, as soon as John Turturro opened his mouth, I cringed. I laughed in the wrong places. A bad accent does this; ruin an otherwise very good film. Therefore, I may amend this later; after watching all of it, if I can stand it. I would much prefer to read the book it is based on, for now. Turturro has a truly authentic New York City accent, simply brcause he was born and raised there, and still lives there. He is as NY as the Yankees and I love his acting ability. Johnny Depp may be a celebrity, but he is not a better actor than Turturro. All this said and done, Mr. Turturro's southern accent is woeful; truly. It's a shame. He over does it; turning a ""thriller"" into a comedy, which is hatd to do, when there dhoukd be nothing to laugh about. I first saw him a great film: William Friedkin's ""To Live and Die in L.A."" (1985). Thete are several excellent actors in it; however, Willem Dafoe steals the entire film. He is brilliant. BTW, when I lived on Sullivan St. in Soho, Dafoe lived on Wooster St; 3 streets over.

Good colour design in opening motel bit, and throughout, eerie atmosphere in the woods, great acting from all involved, (especially John Turturro as the hick, John Shooter, who almost never blinks while on-screen) but I figured out the ending about 15 minutes before it happened, which took a bit of the fun out of it.

73,brando647,An Underrated King Adaptation,8,16 October 2012,"When you need a taut thriller loaded with suspense and chills, you can't go wrong with adapting a Stephen King tale (assuming the movie DREAMCATCHER didn't exist). SECRET WINDOW is an adaption from the short story ""Secret Window, Secret Garden"" in King's four- story collection, ""Four Past Midnight."" I'd read the book years ago when I was in middle school and, to be honest, it was my least favorite of the four stories. I probably would've been more supportive of a big screen remake of THE LANGOLIERS, but I'm happy to report that SECRET WINDOW came out a lot better than I would've expected. It's based on a short story, so writer/director David Koepp had his work cut out for him expanding upon the story to make a feature length movie out of it. It's the tale of the unfortunately named Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp), an author who's in the midst of a nasty divorce and has retreated to his remote cabin to clear his head and work on his next novel. He's approached by John Shooter, a dairy farmer who has traveled from Mississippi to accuse Rainey of plagiarizing one of his stories. Rainy, of course, believes the man to be a nut-case but Shooter is dead serious and he intends to make things right. Things begin to escalate and Rainey fears for his life and that of his estranged wife, but seeing as how this is based on a King story.not everything in the situation is as it seems.After re-watching STIR OF ECHOES to be reminded of how mediocre the whole thing came out, it's nice that SECRET WINDOW adds a positive note to David Koepp's career as a director. This movie isn't going to win any awards or top anyone's favorites list, but it's a strong little thriller with engaging characters. The success of this movie can most likely be attributed to its prime casting of Johnny Depp and John Turturro (as Shooter). Both of these men are incredibly talented character actors and work great when set against each other here. Rainey is holding on to his last bit of sanity while repressing his rage over his estranged wife's (Maria Bello) infidelity and subsequent relationship with Ted (Timothy Hutton), a constant thorn in Rainey's side. He's holding on as best he can, and then Shooter comes along and applies the pressure. Turturro is awesome as Shooter, menacing with his slow Southern drawl and apparent courtesy while he threatens to burn Rainey's life to the ground if he isn't given restitution. Without these two strong leads, SECRET WINDOW is nothing more than your average thriller with a somewhat predictable story and a final flourish that some viewers might see coming. There are slight tweaks from the short story but nothing that doesn't improve on the plot. Some segments of the film might feel as if they're riding on longer than necessary but Koepp did the best he could with expanding on the story and tried to wrangle in some further character development. As an example, I don't remember the whole Mort/Ted conflict being so prominent in the book but it works well here.SECRET WINDOW isn't all that memorable a film, but it's a solid watch for a lazy afternoon and I don't see it disappointing anyone. The performances are perfect, the story is engaging enough, and there are a good few thrills to be had. The tension mounts from the very beginning with the arrival of Shooter and continues to grow until the ending, and I think it was a pretty awesome end to the movie. It's both horrible and fitting as closure to the film. Most fans of Stephen King will want to make sure they give this movie a viewing, as it's one of the lower profile adaptations that I can easily see fading into the background undeservedly. It's a worthy addition to a King film collection.",Secret Window

How is it possible that a genius like David Koepp or one of the best actors on earth like Johnny Depp took this job? The problem is perhaps in the script and not in the acting. But Johnny Depp looked here very poor without any power. The great films with him are getting more and more rare but responsible for this are the bad quality of the scripts of today!! When will they finally create better ideas in Hollywood? Stephen Kings last novels have been produced without any big successes. The story was a great disappointment and was executed very very bad. The only thing I liked in this waste of time was the house at the lake and the good camera work. The rest was a big torture and I am also asking how could it top at the box offices!

It's really unfortunate that it feels like the time since Depp has been a part of a good film has been longer than the time his A-list status felt truly earned. Despite all the very recent flops, he still seems to have his label, but maybe that's because people around the world will still buy a DVD with Depp's face on it regardless of what it is. Secret Window is about as mild a thriller as you can get with a PG-13 rating. It's really distilled, living in a world of movie logic where it sets the stakes and twists the plot. Pretty typical of mild thriller expert Koepp. After a decade of goofy sinister, it's really hard to take Depp as sincerely sinister. But the film is never bad and it has great, kinetic cinematography and production for what it is. There is interesting meta ideas in its material, given that it's a film about writing, creativity and authorship, but that's one that only entertains for just a little while.6/10",Secret Window

It looks like that as it happens also with most Hitchcock movies, for instance, the director developed the story complicating it more and more to enhance the thrilling atmosphere, surprising us with unexpected turns but ending by defrauding our expectation of seeing the explanation of everything if not clearly told at least suggested, because maybe he didn't know how to disentangle what he had entangled. The story in itself as it's shown at the beginning is rather simple. A writer is haunted by a mysterious man who accuses him of having plagiarized one of his stories from one he has written and wants him to assume this and write the correct end to that same story. Our main character (Johnny Depp) is haunted by the man's presence at his lonely house threatening him in a sinister way.

If I have to best describe the film is a miss and hit it does have some good performances and scare factors which is more shocking when you watch the film if you are a fan of mystery or Mr.King then you will be for a treat with this film.

83,mstomaso,Decent adaptation of a tough bit of material,6,20 June 2005,"When I first heard that this film was in production, I was frankly very surprised. I have read all of Steve King's work, and ""Secret Window, Secret Garden"" was never something I felt would make an easy film adaptation. I was even more surprised to hear that Johnny Depp - an actor who rarely mis-steps - was signed for the lead. Now, add both Depp and John Turturro doing deep-south accents, and I'm afraid, you've just disappeared into a mirror through which I could never pass. Yet, here it is. And somehow, they all pull it off. Secret Window is a fairly well made and entertaining shocker, with some amazingly creepy and bizarre performances by Depp and Turturro, and some good eerie camera work and sound. That said, I will cut right to the chase - THIS IS NOT A FEEL-GOOD FILM - so don't come to it looking for straightforward fun, comedy or a happy-go-lucky story. This is hardcore Stephen King, and does not necessarily let anybody off the hook. As with many of the film adaptations of Steve King, this is a film best seen AFTER you read the original work. This film, like so many others, lacks the depth, detail and richness of King's writing, but does relate the story particularly well, and occasionally achieves a literary feel.This film, like the original story, is a disturbing mystery dealing with the connection between unconscious thought and premeditated murder.Depp's Mort Rainey is an odd-ball writer undergoing a painful divorce from a wife who he found cheating. He has locked himself away in their vacation cabin deep in the woods, taking long naps, smoking, and apparently experiencing writer's block. Soon enough, ""Shooter"" (Turturro), an obsessive sociopath fan shows up. Mr. Shooter claims that Rainey stole one of his stories, and demands that he re-publish it with Shooter's name and that he ""fix the ending."" In Shooter's version of the story, the protagonist kills his wife and buries her in her 'secret garden, which can be seen from the 'secret window' of their house. Mr Shooter, it seems, will go to any length to ensure that his will is carried out, and is particularly adept at connecting Mr Rainey, but not himself, to all of his dirty little deeds. Depp plays the down and out writer well, appearing alternatingly drunk, depressed, anxious, confused, desperate and angry. Depp deserves credit for handling this very difficult role decently, however, this is not his usual flawless performance. Turturro is especially creepy as the monotone, murderous, and obsessive Mr Shooter. These two succeed in transforming every scene in which either of them appear, with the help of some clever directing and camera work, into something surreal and memorable. One of the most convincing aspects of this film is the way it shifts from the otherworldly weirdness of these two to the very ordinary lives of all of the other characters. The plot becomes somewhat transparent about 2/3rds of the way through the film, but, as with some of King's more predictable works, it's not what happens but how it happens that is interesting in the end. If I remember the original story correctly, the 'secret window' becomes something of a metaphor for the later action of the story. This is not really explored in the film, and any non-King fan in the audience might end up wondering what the title of the film really means.Bottom-line: Recommended for Stephen King fans, mildly recommended for non-King folks.",Secret Window
84,mentalcritic,Better than it deserves to be,8,18 March 2005,"Usually, Stephen King writes great stories, or even just good stories, on which crap films are based. The Shining and It are very good examples of stories so rich in detail that, in film format, fail to make sense or grip the viewer for one reason or another. Secret Window, Secret Garden, on the other hand, is part of a ponderous, dull collection of material that leaves readers confused, even feeling ripped off. While Four Past Midnight had its highlights, Secret Window, Secret Garden was definitely not one of them. The film, simply retitled Secret Garden, manages to tell the story in less than a hundred minutes, and does so in a considerably more economic fashion.Part of this economy can be attributed to the difference between film and literature. In the novella, King takes pages and pages to describe some of the most tangential things, such as the taste of a cigarette. In film, details such as the appearance of John Shooter is immediately clarified for the viewer. This is one area where the film improves on the novella, in fact. Aside from a reasonably tall man with a Southern drawl, as King himself might put it, the character is intangible. John Turturro, one of the most amusing actors of O Brother, Where Art Thou?, makes John Shooter all his own, and therefore considerably more frightening.Like the novella, the film's entire strength rests upon the lead character, a novelist named Morton Rainey. For the first half of the novella, Morton is a very likable, even understandable character. In film, Johnny Depp irons out the flaws that dominate the second half, and keeps the viewer in his corner of the ring until the shock ending. The film ending is different from the novella ending, and this is one of the few areas where the film adaptation does not work quite as well as it would have hoped. The ending of the novella leaves Morton's fate, or rather the complete details thereof, open to question. By contrast, the film's ending leaves absolutely nothing to the imagination, something that Stephen King would have abhorred in the days when he wrote such classics on which classic films have been based, namely The Dead Zone.The rest of the cast do the best they can with limited roles, and are generally quite successful. Maria Bello as Amy Rainey is one of those performances where an actor takes a character that turned into an empty shadow during the novella and makes something substantial out of it. Lest anyone think I am pounding on Stephen King for no reason here, the number of times I read Secret Window, Secret Garden in my teens when it first hit Australian shelves in paperback format is beyond count. All I can remember from it is the premise and how it ends. By comparison, while Secret Window is not going to set the world ablaze, it is one of the better films to be made from King's material.In all, I gave Secret Window an eight out of ten. It loses a couple of points for a jarring ending, but it has two of the best performances of King's characters ever captured on celluloid. It is well worthy of a viewing.",Secret Window
85,hall895,Depp elevates it to just OK,6,3 November 2006,"Secret Window is a movie which is left to Johnny Depp to pretty much carry all by himself. And Depp proves mostly up to the task. The material he has to work with is OK, but certainly nothing special. It's an interesting story but you've certainly seen better. But Depp does a terrific job of infusing his character, and by extension, the whole movie with some sorely needed life. Whenever the movie threatens to begin to really drag, and there are more than a few of those moments, Depp is there to rescue the whole enterprise.Depp plays novelist Mort Rainey, whom as we meet him is tucked away all by himself in an out-of-the-way cabin working on his latest novel. It's not a good time to be Mort Rainey. His wife cheated on him and he's going through a divorce. And he is making hardly any progress at all on his new book. But things are about to get even worse. A strange (to put it mildly) man named John Shooter, played by John Turturro, shows up at Mort's doorstep claiming Mort plagiarized one of his stories. Mort is quite sure that he didn't but Shooter won't give this fight up easily. Played with sufficient creepiness by Turturro, Shooter becomes a rather unwelcome menace in Mort's life. Strange, scary things begin to happen and Mort's life may soon depend on proving the story was in fact his.The conflict between Mort and Shooter, Depp and Turturro, is the heart of the movie. But it is really Depp's movie all the way. Shooter works well as a device to get Mort suitably freaked out. But the story's about Mort. And as such the success or failure of the movie really lies with Depp. And his performance is good enough to make the film work. The story is slow at times, predictable at others, and the ultimate conclusion with the requisite ""big twist"" may well leave you a bit cold. But whatever frustrations you may have with the film Depp's winning performance will ultimately make it worth your while.",Secret Window
86,CitizenCaine,Another Stephen King Deja Vu Story,6,3 April 2004,"David Koepp, the writer of the terrific Panic Room, directs Johnny Depp in Secret Window: a film that seems to enjoy playing a big joke on the audience. The film is based on a Stephen King novella, but bears more than a striking resemblance to his past work. A writer (Depp) slowly becomes unhinged due to a combination of circumstances, a pending divorce settlement, writer's block, and a visit from a strange hick from Mississippi with a penchant for committing vile acts (John Turturro). The film contains good performances by Depp and Turturro, but most of the supporting cast have little to do with the exception of Maria Bello as Depp's ex-wife. The isolated cabin location is appropriate for the tale, as is the music by Philip Glass. There are several clues along the way that leave hints as to what's to come later, but the pace of the film is slow at times, and the tongue in cheek humor in the latter third of the film is in stark contrast to the earlier suspenseful tone. It would have been more welcome had it been present right from the beginning. For instance, poking black humor at his own divorce would have been even more delicious and ultimately in character. Still, Depp carries the film, and it does not surrender to a conventional denouement. Stay around through the closing credits for another delightful surprise. **1/2 of 4 stars.",Secret Window

89,juliankennedy23,Secret Window... The secret is you have seen this before.,5,29 November 2008,"Secret Window: 5 out of 10: I am not going to critique Johnny Depp. He is fine in this movie. And I certainly do not want the great wrath of woman, of various ages, down upon my head. Johnny Depp is a thespian God. He can do no wrong. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory never existed... (God he was awful in that.) Depp’s performance is the most entertaining thing is Secret Window. In fact with the exception of a wonderfully drawn Timothy Hutton in a supporting role, it is the only entertaining thing in the movie. The small cast is rounded out by Maria Bello (A 41 year old butterface that plays Depp’s, cuckolding, bitchy, soon to be ex-wife) and the usually dependable John Turturro who is a disaster.This is a Stephen King adaption about a writer going over the edge. (If you saw the Dark Half which also starred Timothy Hutton this will definitely feel like familiar ground). The plot is a familiar train wreck. Depp is a writer going through a nasty divorce and suffering from writers block. There is a knock at the door and Turturro is at the door. With a southern drawl and an Amish tailor Turturro claims that Depp stole his story and has to make it right.Ah plagiarism, that old plot twist standby which many a great horror novel is based on. (Or maybe not). Turtorro’s character quickly becomes a nasty bit of work as he kills Depp’s beloved dog with a screwdriver. (This isn’t really a plot spoiler. This is a Steven King adaptation, there are no kids in it to kill and the beloved dog might as well have been dressed in a metaphorical red shirt from the first scene.) This is where the movie officially lost me. Turturro is about as threatening as a Joe Pesci romantic comedy and if his character (named Shooter) killed one of my family members the next time he entered my property he would be renamed shot.But the movie cannot let Depp kill Shooter... cause of a super secret plot twist so lame and so obvious that it’s no wonder plagiarism was at the forefront of the writer’s mind. To add insult to injury the movie actually feels it needs to drop hints at this shocking plot twist apparently under the assumption a portion of the audience sniffs glue for a living and didn’t figure it out within 10 minutes of the opening credits.The only real surprise in the entire film is the strange Children of the Corn references (Turtorro’s character seems to be clearly channeling Malachi and the last scene is torn right from that mid-eighties classic.) Perhaps the film is meant to be homage to the fine Children of the Corn series... No greater faint praise could I imagine damning with.",Secret Window

It's tacky, of course, like most King film adaptations, and it's creepy, of course, as only a King film adaptation can be.  I gave it a five (the equivalent of **1/2) because it wasn't really solid (which would be a six - the equivalent of ***), but if you're in the mood for Depp-ravity, this would be the perfect movie for you, if only just to find out if you can see the so-called surprise ending coming a mile away.",Secret Window
91,rainking_es,The nth psycho-thriller...,5,16 August 2004,"The first 60 minutes from ""Secret Window"" looks like an ordinary thriller, well constructed, with some intensity and suspense, and with the invaluable presence of Johnny Depp and John Turturro. That's ok. Everything's been said in this genre, but that does not mean that a good thriller may be made nowadays. If you have a nice story, a nice rhythm, nice actors, you can as well make an entertaining movie... And that's what happens with ""Secret Window"", till we come to its crazy (as f.!) ending. Everything gets out of control, everything becomes boring and so hackneyed (even Depp's performance gets out of control, and his histrionism comes to the surface, ruining his whole job in this movie). ""Secret Window"" tells the story of a writer (Depp) acused of plagiarism by a weird and violent man (Turturro) ... But the movie itself copies some premises from other recent thrillers (that I won't name here not to spoil the ending), and Koepp ""pays tribute"" to Roman Polanski's ""Repulsion"", showing cracks in the wall as a metaphora of madness. Now, ¿who's to blame? This is an adaptation from an Stephen King's story, so I think he's the responsible for this film (unless Koepp had change the ending -I don't think so-). Anyway, you'll enjoy the first hour, and you'll get SO dissapointed as the ""mistery"" gets revealed. Koepp did it much better in ""Stir of echoes"".My rate: 4.5/10",Secret Window
92,TheNorthernMonkee,fun and well acted with a excellent twist,6,5 June 2005,"SPOILERS There are few Horror writers with as wide a fan base as Stephen King. Loved by many, King has written some of the most surreal, dark and occasionally twist laden stories of all time. When you get a decent King story and you pair it with one of Hollywood's golden boys, you expect success therefore. ""Secret Window"" is the outcome and whilst it's not quite as good as it could be, it is still fun enough and well acted, to keep people entertained throughout.Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) is a well known author who is going through a messy divorce. As if life isn't complicated enough, when Mississippi born John Shooter (John Turturro) arrives accusing Rainey of plagiarism, things begin to get even worse.Everybody likes Johnny Depp. Most women adore the man and most men admire his acting talent. With a wide range of skills, Depp can switch from humorous to deep in a matter of seconds. In ""Secret Window"" he again shows this skill as the tormented Mort. Pushed around, occasionally violent, always disturbed and occasionally funny, Depp's character is a difficult one to play, yet he manages admirably. We witness a Johnny Depp masterclass and we should feel grateful for being allowed to experience it.The story itself is also a pleasant enough experience. Not quite as good as some of King's other works, we are still given large numbers of clues to keep us guessing, and even when people predict events, for many the twist at the end is still a solid enough surprise.Perhaps the one major flaw with ""Secret Window"" is the way certain routes aren't taken. The window never feels fully explored and certain potential mystic events aren't explained at the conclusion. In fact, the conclusion as a whole is a bit of a disappointment. After things come together and we find out the truth, you tend to expect a well constructed finale. Unfortunately though the last ten minutes feel like they die a slow death and you can't help but feel slightly disappointed when the end credits roll.It's not the best Stephen King adaptation ever, and there are countless better films released every year, but ""Secret Window"" is still worth watching. Led by a brilliant performance by Johnny Depp, the story has enough going on in it to keep you hooked and entertained throughout. Good nighttime viewing, but if not for Depp it wouldn't be worth the effort.",Secret Window
93,jpschapira,Koepp and directing...I'm sorry,6,4 December 2005,"There's no doubt that David Koepp is a talented screenwriter, and that Johnny Depp is a magician when it comes to acting. Then there's no doubt that Depp will always deliver a marvelous spectacle, and that Koepp will always write a solid screenplay. Why not? Because ""Secret Window"" is not a good movie, but we can't say that is because of the screenplay, written by someone who's been writing good scripts his entire career.So what will I blame? The direction; does this sound awkward? It should, because I thought I'd like this movie very much, mainly because Depp always chooses the most interesting things; but of course, in terms of character playing, not in terms of anything else he gives importance to, but not a lot of importance.Therefore I ask myself: ""What do I know about David Koepp's direction?"". The answer is ""nothing"". And ironically ""The Trigger Effect"" and ""Stir of echoes"" are two films I've wanted to see for a long time; but until I see them, ""Secret Window"" is the only sample of Koepp's direction I'll have: and I'm not fond of it.The man likes suspense because that is what he directs, but directing suspense is a complicated matter; and his simple camera is not what I'm used to see in movies likes this. The opening credits say a lot; the show a lake, and the camera starts getting nearer to a cabin. Inside the cabin, it wanders around the place very slowly, ending up where the main character Mort Rainey (Depp) is sleeping.It goes the same way during the entire ride, with movements side to side, or up and down with a lot of dull still cameras. Why still cameras when there's nothing interesting the characters talk about? I guess that there are probably two ways of directing suspense; slowly and paced, with a lot of detention in things (but, when it's really an intelligent movie), or quickly and indefinite, with a lot of constant movement to confuse the viewer.Although it was not for his movie, Koepp chose the first one. Which is good, in a way, because it introduces us to the isolated world of the main character, a writer (like in most of Stephen King's novels), played by Johnny Depp with his common craziness and eccentricity that defines the great actor in him. The way he moves his hands, the way he speaks and how he walks all by himself in a placeIt is challenging, but I suppose easy and enjoying for the magician.Then the camera introduces other people that won't seem relevant once you figure out things, or maybe they will. John Turturo is pretty solid in the role of John Shooter, a weird individual who claims having been plagiarized; Maria Bello is quite insignificant as Mort's wife Amy; and Timothy Hutton (the guy is so dead) doesn't find his way (I'm sorry, he delivers a good portrayal) as the third in discord, Ted. What else can I say? Nothing stands out...Watch it if you love (not like) Depp, expect whateverOh, and, yes; there is a twist.",Secret Window

I'd wager that $30M alone must have went to Johnny Depp because I've seen $5M Blumhouse movies with the same production values as this.3/4 of the way into the movie I started thinking about the numerous plot holes in the script, but when the main twist comes around, it's easy to see why I thought there were mistakes made on the screenwriter's part. All in all it wasn't a bad suspense thriller. It was reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock's 70's thrillers ""Frenzy"" and ""Family Plot"", two flicks, unfortunately, that are forgettable as this one.",Secret Window

96,Son_of_Mansfield,The Johnny Depp Show.,6,10 December 2005,"Johnny Depp's bent performance makes this movie bearable. His lively hair and guttural noises make up for a script that is a snoze and a really annoying John Turturro. The major flaw with the script is that you end up wanting Johnny Depp to do whatever he wants. He is more fun and the story is secondary. Then, John Turturro sports a bad southern accent and comes off as something like a hack writer would come up with to be a villain. Maria Bello and Timothy Hutton's characters are seen through Mort's eyes only, I didn't feel bad when they were killed. Charles S. Dutton was sufficiently tough, but I didn't buy Mort killing him. The whole Shooter plot is too slow, which makes Turturro even more unbearable. David Koepp loves the ending so much that he spends the entire movie waiting just to show it to you. If you like Johnny Depp, you will find some good from this, but The Dark Half, Fight Club, and Memento are better movies.",Secret Window
97,movieguy1021,Secret Window: 4/10,4,20 March 2004,"In my opinion, Johnny Depp is one of the most overrated actors out there. Although I haven't seen two of his major works, Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood (the latter's DVD which was pushed back), I was just never a fan. Even his over-the-top performance in Pirates of the Caribbean couldn't really save it. And in Secret Window, his first major role since Pirates, there was a way he could pull through to save the sinking movie, but he only added to this disaster. Instead of pulling what could be a plausible performance, he creates quite possibly the most annoying character ever to come onto celluloid.Depp plays supposedly famous writer Mort, who is working on his next novel in a secluded cabin in a secluded forest in which everyone knows how to get to and where there's an unlimited supply of Doritos and Mountain Dew. One day, an odd man named John Shooter (John Turturro) comes up to his ""secluded"" cabin and tells Mort that his story ""Secret Window"" was stolen by Mort. Unless Shooter gets proof that Mort wrote it first, he will do very bad PG-13 things to him and people around him.Based on a Stephen King ""novella"" (aka a story he couldn't pad out to 700 pages), Secret Window could have been about the isolation felt by Mort as he's working alone on writing something (but then again, it's exactly like The Shining...he'd be plagiraizing off of his own work!), or it could have gotten into the tormentor's head (see also: Misery). But instead, it focuses on Mort's ""daily routine"" and his worthless inter-personal relationships with one-dimensional characters that exist for stupid ""plot"" developments later on. And once writer/director David Koepp's (who wrote both Panic Room and Spider-Man screenplay gets psychological, it's a complete ripoff of a certain cult movie from 1999 (I won't say which one, because the ending might be the only surprising part of the movie for you).There were a couple tense scenes, mainly starting out with random jumps to get us ""in the mood"". Then there's the overbearing Philip Glass music score. I think that Secret Window could learn something from movies of the 70's, and that's that music isn't necessary for a suspenseful movie. Many movies back then didn't even have music in them for most of the time. Everyone who dies was obviously going to die, and as the movie drew to a close, it just became more and more clichéd.Three of the four main characters were impossible to like, so it was impossible to feel anything with them. Mort was obnoxious, lazy, stubborn, and spoiled, and how are we supposed to care about a guy whose biggest decisions are whether to put ice in his Mountain Dew or not? Amy (Maria Bello from The Cooler) popped in at random times to call someone she supposedly hated (who is Mort, and I wonder why...). Ted (Timothy Hutton) thankfully didn't have much to do, so his annoying character couldn't be developed much. However, Turturro did a subdued, over-the-top role and made his character a welcome presence. Overall, though, this movie is chiefly for teenage girls who see it for Johnny Depp (what DO they see in him?) or for some stupid, cheap scares.My rating: 4/10Rated PG-13 for violence/terror, sexual content and language.",Secret Window

I don't like his books or his movies/tv shows adaptations. Every single one turned out to be a huge disappointment. As soon as I see his name I move on to something else because even if (and that's a big if) the story is alright usually the ending is awful. I'm also not a Johnny Depp fan. He's ok in crazy roles like ""Alice in Wonderland"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" but other than that I always found him to be a little dull.
With that said, I still watched the movie because I was really bored and there wasn't anything better to watch.To my big surprise, the opposite of what I expected happened. I expected the movie to be interesting and the ending to be awful but as it turned out, the movie was mostly boring (and slow paced) and the ending was alright. I figured it out before Mort did but it explained a lot. Like, for example, if you're being stalked by a crazy dangerous person who killed your dog why won't you use that buttload of money of yours to move out of your remote completely insecure home? Or at least hire someone serious to protect you and not one guy who comes once a day to look under your bed before you go to sleep!To the movies creators credit, they changed Stephen King's ending. I read the book ending and it was way worse. I definitely prefer the movie ending. With that said, ending is NOT the only thing that matters. Half the movie we watch Johnny Depp doing absolutely nothing (sleeping, eating, staring at his computer) or doing stupid things like listening to Shotter or driving all the way to his ex's house and without taking the magazine. Granted, the ending explains it but it doesn't change the fact that I was mostly bored. So while watchable I can't give it higher than 6/10.Oh and btw, if a guy is suspected of his wife and her boyfriend/fiancé disappearance I'm pretty sure the cops would take a good look at his property.

He is living alone in a lake house and is trying to complete his new story but the problem is he is having a writer's block. To make matter worse he gets a visitor known as John Shooter from Mississippi who wears a brimmed black hat and claims that Mort plagiarised one of his stories known as Secret Window. The story funny enough is about a man who murders his wife and buries her in a garden where after a time she will be forgotten. Mort denies the accusation but Shooter insists this is not the case and stalks the author and causes bad things to happen. Question is did he stole the story??The movie has a real Hitchcockian theme and the music score really does give that suspenseful tone throughout the film. Johnny Depp cleverly plays his character as he is barely recognisable with the mop hair, careless appearance including wearing his ex-wife night gown. He talks to himself and his nearly blind old dog and entertains the story in a quirky way such as the strange facial tick. Without his performance the movie would have been a disaster. Another great element used was the lake house/cottage including disturbing sounds, broken light blubs and just been isolated are key elements to a good suspenseful movie. And that was the outcome of this flick, it was good, not great, could have better but good. The first half of the movie was good but comes falling down in the second and the major twist at the end could have been explained such as the pages gone from the magazine or the house getting burnt down. The twist itself was predictable - either the pacing was slow or the there were too many clues. The reveal felt over dramatic with the writings on the wall and wayyy too rushed and didn't hit the nail which is disappointing as the entire movie built up to this huge finale.

The other characters are very cliched and are not very involving.  Maria Bello tries hard with an underwritten role but her character is unlikable.

Not only does the man not leave him alone, but murders begin taking place right before his very eyes, but the question is, can our hero save lives before the end of the film?A good watch, and although I've seen it twice, I probably won't see it again.

The beautiful scenery in the woods was the perfect setting for such a creepy movie.2. Johnny Depp. As always, Depp's performance is right on the money. He goes from victim to lunatic better than most actors.3. John Turturro. I have seen Turturro in several movies, and, as always he shines in this movie, being quietly menacing...matching Depp's performance easily.4. The scene where we see Depp's character give in to his madness. Truly frightening.What I DIDN'T like about the movie: 1. The long, drawn out scenes watching Depp sleep.2. The gratuitous violence...didn't need to see Depp remove the screwdriver from the guys head! 3. The fake suspense. If the movie had been done right, you wouldn't need it.Basically, I feel the same way about this movie as I feel about most of Stephen King's works: They should stay printed work, not movies. King's brilliance is in his understanding that anything you can imagine is MUCH worse than anything anyone could show you. This is especially true when you are describing a decent into madness...how do you accurately show what's going on in someone's head? I can only give this movie a three because of the acting...nothing else.There are much better psychological thrillers out there.",Secret Window
114,CabbageCustard,Very average psychological thriller,6,9 December 2019,"Stephen King books have proven to be a rich resource for Hollywood types looking for movie ideas. Unfortunately, the quality of the resulting movies has been quite erratic. Some have been brilliant, some have been awful. Secret Window falls somewhere in the middle, leaning towards the lower end of the spectrum. I watched this with a friend who had seen it before (I had not) and who waxed lyrical about what a great suspense movie this was and about the great twist at the end. Sadly, I didn't find it suspenseful at all and I guessed the twist before the movie was halfway over.There are the makings of a really good movie in this. John Turturro makes a very creepy and sinister villain and his interactions with Depp's character are very edgy. If the movie had continued to focus on and explore what was going on there it would have been a much better film. Of course, then it wouldn't have been true to its source material. As it is, the movie completely squanders all that tension as the 'twist' is revealed. On top of that, the way the 'twist' is revealed is downright lazy writing: Depp's character is confronted by....(wait for it)... Depp's character and the truth is revealed. It's really a silly scene. From that point on, the movie just becomes sillier and sillier before it eventually shudders to a close with what I think is meant to be a chilling, menacing ending. Unfortunately, by that time the movie has lost significant credibility and the ending falls flat. If you care to sit through the end credits till they are completed, you will encounter some voice over by Depp which seems quite pointless, out of character and does not invoke the chills it is meant to.Yes, this is quite a flawed movie. The best I can say for it is that it is not boring and, until it suddenly changes course towards the end, it will keep you interested.",Secret Window
115,ScottDMenzel,An Above Average Horror/Thriller With An Outstanding Performance by the One and Only Johnny Depp,7,15 March 2004,"I have been anxiously awaiting the release of Johnny Depp's new film Secret Window since I first seen the trailer for it. Johnny Depp who to me has always been one of my favorite actors, never really got noticed or credit before last year's Box Office Smash Hit Pirates of the Caribbean. Well this is technically Depp's first film since Pirates so he has reeled in a new audience for his films. So, on Friday night, after my painfully long night at Blockbuster, Jen picked me up and we went to eat, and then went to the 11:10pm showing of Secret Window. Secret Window is about a divorced writer named Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp). The movie begins on a depressing note where Mort finds out that his wife Amy (Maria Bello) is cheating on him. The movie than flashes forward a few months when Mr. Rainey is living all alone in the woods. A weird man named Mr. Shooter (John Turturro) shows up and accuses him of plagiarism. Mr. Rainey believes the allegations to be false but is now being stalked by this Mr. Shooter. Then things start to occur and it's up the Mr. Rainey to stop this before him and his ex-wife become harmed.Another terrific performance by Johnny Depp is the main reason to see the film. Johnny Depp again proves to be one of my all time favorite actors. His acting is flawless; he delivers yet again another terrific character. What I like about Depp is that he always plays a different weird character in every film he is in and to top it off every character he portrays is likable. So Bravo Mr. Depp on another great performance for your resume. I also really liked John Turturro who nailed the southern stalker role. He was very creepy and his character was very believable. You don't want to mess with Mr. Shooter believe me. Maria Bello does another good job and can add this good film to her resume along with her great performance in The Cooler. Timothy Hutton who played the boyfriend Tim was also good as the a**hole character. I really did not like him and I felt the anger the Depp's character Mort had towards him. The cast of this film was right on target.
Secret Window was based on a Stephen King book entitled Secret Window, Secret Garden. The movie was drafted into a screenplay by writer/director David Koepp who wrote many great films including Panic Room, Stir of Echoes, and even the original Jurassic Park. I don't read many books so I don't really know if the book is like the movie. I know that the movie did have great dialog and a good story. The script wasn't on the completely original side, which I don't know if that is because he stayed loyal to the book but the script was very well done. It was a very well written piece in my opinion. David Koepp who again wrote many screenplays but has only directed three films in which only one of them I have seen. David Koepp did a good job on the film, there are some really great locations in which this film was shot. The cabin in the woods was very creepy and I liked that the main character lived in this small town. There were also some pretty cool camera angles in the film along with some really suspenseful scenes. I have no problem what so ever with David Koepp's work on the film, he wrote and directed a good thriller.In conclusion, I liked the film but not as much as I wanted to and the reason for that is because I watched the film and didn't find the film to be a laugh out loud comedy in like the rest of the theater thought it was. My fellow moviegoers must have been watching a different movie because to me the film had a few chuckles here and there but the audience at times was in hysterics like we were watching Austin Powers or some other laugh out loud comedy. So because of this occurring, I had a hard time really trying to concentrate on the film while people were laughing like a bunch of buffoons behind me. I still really enjoyed the film nonetheless; it had great performances, a good story, and a pretty decent ending. I would recommend it to everyone who enjoys a good horror/thriller film and doesn't like stupid horror films like Freddy vs. Jason or stuff like that because this isn't for you. This is more along the lines of a movie like Identity although Identity is a bit better; Secret Window is still worth checking out. I think Depp's performance is worth the price of admission alone but you get his performance along with a good story and a decent ending with Secret Window. My final rating is an 8/10.",Secret Window

118,ryan_kuhn,"""I killed a mirror.""",4,19 February 2005,"Stephen King has written many books that have been turned into movies, some better than others. Secret Window, inspired by a King book, will not be remembered as one of the ""better"" ones. A slow, plodding, predictable story about recently divorced author Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) and his encounters with a stalker, a character named Shooter (John Turturro). Shooter has accused Mort of stealing his story and threatens to kill Mort and everyone he may have ever known if he doesn't fix the situation. Mort lives alone in a cabin outside New York City in woods that look more like Central Canada than Westchester County, trying to write another story. While trying to write, he recalls the good times with his ex-wife Amy (Maria Bello) and how a discovery of a window behind a dresser leads him to write ""Secret Window,"" the story he is accused of stealing. Shooter begins affecting Mort and his life almost immediately, Mort's dog is killed, a man who saw Shooter talk to Mort is found dead, and crucial evidence that Mort could use to clear his name is destroyed. About halfway though the movie though, we start to get the feeling that all is not what it appears, and when the final scenes come to us, we realize we've been taken on a ride we've been on before and nothing surprising or groundbreaking has occurred. The end is a bit of a cheat, as a matter of fact, I wanted a more interesting ending than what we ended up with. The acting is fine, though I had a tough time getting the image of the uber-Jew that Turturro played in Quiz Show out of my mind while he does a Southern accent while talking to Mort. Secret Window is perhaps worth a look, just don't expect the unexpected.",Secret Window
119,MF210,"An entertaining, intelligent thriller",8,15 November 2004,"My Rating: *** out of ****. Secret Window is another one of those thrillers thats based on a Stephen King novel. However, unlike last years Dreamcatcher, this is an entertaining and well-made film. The film succeeds because of a superlative lead performance, tight direction, and an intelligent script. Secret Window is nowhere near the likes of The Shining or Shawshank Redemption(two excellent Stephen King adaptations although I have yet to read the books) but it gets the job done. The difference between this film and last years Dreamcatcher is that Dreamcatcher dealt with extraterrestrials while Secret Window deals with nothing of the sort. Secret Window is similar to The Shining in that it deals with a man being isolated from the rest of the world and it eventually drives him mad. A competent director is needed to bring a claustrophobic feel to the film and David Koepp does not let us down.In addition to developing a claustrophobic atmosphere, Koepp gets a brilliant performance from Johnny Depp. Depp has always guaranteed at least a solid performance in front of the camera but this has got to be one of the three best performances he has ever given. The only ones I can think of where he does a better job are his Oscar-Nominated turn in Pirates of the Caribbean and his masterful performance in Blow. Here, Depp gives an intense, riveting performance about a man isolated from the world. Although Koepp deserves credit for creating a sense of claustrophobia, Depp deserves some too. Without Depp's on-target performance, this film probably would not have worked as well. Unfortunately, while the casting of Depp helps the film, the casting of John Turturro does not. I will admit that Turturro is a good comic actor and I admire him for trying to play against type but it just did not work. Turturro is so obviously miscast as this supposedly creepy individual. To be fair, there are instances where it seems like Turturro might have been able to handle the role but they are very few and brief. The script helps the film though. This is an intelligently constructed thriller. There is a twist near the end but it fits perfectly in the film. In other words, it does not seem like a cheat. The script does not contain any horrendously bad dialogue and the lead character is well-developed.Overall, Secret Window works. Its a solid thriller that may be the best thriller I have seen this year. While thats not saying a whole lot, Secret Window is definitely worth your time.",Secret Window

121,Ronin47,"Depp is awesome, but the story is disappointingly cliched (**)",5,28 March 2004,"Johnny Depp is really, really cool. I've liked him ever since I saw ""A Nightmare and Elm Street"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"" when I was a kid, and in the years since he has given an almost ridiculous amount of great, colorful, distinctive performances. Sometimes (but thankfully not often), his performance is the only really good thing about the movie he's in. That's what I thought about the overrated mega-hit ""Pirates Of The Caribbean: Curse Of The Black Pearl"", and is also the case with ""Secret Window"". Depp is fantastic in both, but the movies themselves are lacking. In ""Secret Window"" (based on a novella by Stephen King), he plays Mort Rainey, a perpetually bedraggled author living in a cabin in the middle of the woods. Depressed as a result of his recent separation from his wife, he skulks around the cabin and tries to write a story, but can't get past the first paragraph. Then one day, a knock comes at his door and on the other side is a menacing, creepy man with the ominous name of John Shooter (John Turturro), who accuses him of stealing his story. Though Rainey does not believe he has stolen the story, they are incredibly similar.  Shooter is furious and begins stalking Rainey, pinning menacing notes on his front door and threatening his loved ones, demanding his due credit for the story, even though Rainey knows he didn't steal it. So what happened? The answer to that question is the main reason this film doesn't work. It is embarrassingly easy to figure out the impending Big Twist (I had figured it out about 30 minutes in), so easy that I hoped I was wrong and that it had something else up its sleeve, but it didn't. And when you figure out exactly where a movie like this is headed, it takes a lot of the enjoyment out of it. At least there's Depp. He is very good here and very funny, giving his oddball character lots of entertaining quirks. In fact, his performance actually makes this film (a thriller) much, much funnier than some ""comedies"" I've seen recently (I'm looking at you, ""Welcome To Mooseport""!)
As for the other performances, Turturro is creepy but his Mississippi accent is silly, Bello is mostly just filling space, and Charles S. Dutton is good as a bodyguard friend of Mort's, but he can play this kind of role in his sleep. I'm a huge fan of Stephen King (he is responsible for many of my favorite films), but I can see here what his detractors are saying when they accuse him of recycling his own material, because ""Secret Window"" seems to be constructed from pieces of many of his other stories. Almost worth seeing just for Depp, but when a movie relies entirely on its ending being a surprise, and it isn't, it makes the whole thing pretty pointless.",Secret Window

Twenty minutes in, he has the movie figured out. ""I'm going to make a guess what happens,"" he says. ""Go ahead,"" I innocently reply, already seeing the film. He nails the movie on the head. Asking him to humor me while he further watched with assured confidence, he explained and nitpicked the few things he noticed that just gave away the movie. I noticed these too and it dawned at me that not only we do we watch too many movies, but Hollywood really hasn't tried that hard enough on mystery movies.

128,Panterken,"Todd Downey thought that a woman who would steal your love when your love was really all you had was not much of a woman. He, therefore, decided to kill her.",7,3 November 2008,"'Secret Window' has been criticized due to the end twist; a kind of 'surprise' which became predictable for one reason and one reason only...it's overdone. I checked the 'spoiler' box but I'll still warn you...MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD: Ever since Hitchcock launched the terrifying arrow named 'psycho' at the public, our understandable fascination for one of the strangest of diseases has dimmed down; time and time again it served as an easy way out of a complicated mystery much to the intelligent viewer's frustration.Nevertheless, the Stephen King novella 'secret window, secret garden' (published in 1990) came before the second wave of twist endings, unchained by the release of 'Fight Club', 'The Sixth Sense' and 'The Usual Suspects' in the nineties, it's unfortunate but true that since then not many have blown our heads back like those.Luckily for Secret Window, and for us, the movie relies mostly on the wonderful quirkiness of Depp and the atmosphere; the mood is set right from the start with a great opening scene and an impressive tracking shot accompanied by a tenebrous score, at the end of the shot we're introduced to our Byronic hero, popular horror novelist Mort Rainey. His life's caught in a tailspin; suffering through a divorce from a woman he still loves and tortured by the subsequent writer's block, caused by the loss of his muse. He isolates himself in a lake cabin, killing most of his time napping and exchanging wits with his cataract-stricken dog. In the midst of his anguish, a deranged man, John Shooter comes knocking, spewing accusations of plagiarism. This man is determined that Mort make amends to satisfy his cruel soul, backing up his demands with threats to kill and a warning not to go to the police......I liked how the story continued, Shooter's actions begin to make less and less sense. He's promised a magazine by a deadline he sets, only to harass Mort before that time, which anything but motivates Mort into giving in to Shooter's demands...namely changing the ending. 'Mine's perfect...it's the ONLY ending' Shooter said in the form of John Turturro, the accent with which he says the words and the way he almost seems to stare through Mort (those icy looks, the eyes never blinking; the stare of a psychopath). We can conclude from the context that Shooter's ending's radically different from Mort's own, oh yes...Mort Rainey did, when he penned down the ending for 'secret window', in fact write his last happy ending...Here's Shooter's version: ""I know I can do it,"" Todd Downey said, helping himself to another ear of corn from the steaming bowl. ""I'm sure that in time, every bit of her will be gone and her death will be a mystery... even to me."" And so it shall be, fiction becomes truth. By the way, the similarities between Mort's short story and the events of the plot are fun to observe on a re-watch(so's the relevance of the lines typed at the end of the tracking shot right after the title appeared on screen in blood red).What kept 'Secret Window' afloat as the plot unwinds into the predictable last couple of scenes (double murder) (I'm not talking about the very last scenes, the bookends are fantastic), is a sense of inevitable doom that chokes (and fascinates the darker minded ones among you) the viewers. No miraculous rescue, no escape. Mort is (meaning dead and death in French) a powerful representation of the grim reaper, portrayed with grandeur by a Depp clearly having a lot of fun. Notice the cracking of his jaw, a very discomposing nervous tick, it disconcerted me. Also the braces somehow make Depp seems as dangerous as Jaws, how'd they do that?! He's at the top of his game, his facial reactions are marvelous (you can watch the whole movie muted and still be entertained), this movie's worth the price of admission or rental for the acting alone.My only regret is the lack of more wonderfully dark voice-overs...in the spirit of:'This is not my beautiful wife. This is not my beautiful house. Anymore' or the opening lines 'Turn around. Turn around. Turn the car around and get the hell out of here. Right now. Don't go back. Do not go back there.' Inner dialog of tortured characters can be so fascinating when done right and they obviously know how to, they chose not to put too much in. As far as I'm concerned, that's the only thing I'd done different had I directed it.For me 'Secret Window''s (almost) perfect just the way it is, no attempt at a masterpiece but an unpretentious, fun thriller.",Secret Window

Well, this is the same thing, only better acted by Depp. OK, the story is not 100% the same, but it is about a writer who goes mad at his wife cheating on him and become possessed by a character and/or his own schizo self and ends up on a killing spree. The Dark Half's plot was a bit more scary, as we find out the schizo behavior comes from the fact the writer's twin died inside of him in the womb and had possessed him to go on a killing spree. Secret Window doesn't have that excitement. Not a drop.Then there are The Shining parallels. Crazy writer alone in the woods, goes mad and goes on a killing spree. I am thinking King is not coming up with any ideas of late besides the crazy writer or telekinetic girl, and Kingdom Hospital was Lars Von Trier's idea and not his. It is amazing that people still buy this man's work when it has become painfully repetitive. So much was left out of this movie that could have made it better. The Shooter character played by John Turturro is very stereotypical of a bad guy, wearing all black, creepy Southern accent and smoking. I am sure John Truturro was doing the best he could with the script, since I enjoy his other work, especially Box of Moon Light and Barton Fink. I wonder why both him and Depp are in this lifeless piece of celluloid. But I regress. The bad character was there are the get-go and the average viewer will begin to realize he is so over the top, he can't be real. I was hoping Shooter was real so it would go against the usual King grain. Then I thought, oh gods, if Shooter means ""Shoot Her,"" I'll slap my head and call myself Sally. And it happened! I also thought the same thing if Depp's character had multiple personalities, from the beginning, when he was talking to himself. There wasn't any suspense or mystery. Everything was cut and tried from the first 20 minutes. There was hardly any build up to Depp's mental disorder until the best scene of the film where there are 3 Johhny Depps (I am sure many a woman's fantasy) and he is walking with his face to a mirror where his back is. This special effect could have been used to better advantage if Depp used it as part of his character, then maybe the viewer could say, he's a writer, this is how he works creatively and then we would be thrown of by Shooter. But no. Shooter would have worked better as more of a simple looking guy, instead of the typical King villain dressed in black, screaming visually, ""I am a villain!""The movie leaves many unanswered questions: Was Shooter a character in Secret Window the story? What was the original ending to the story? Why did the old man tell the police he saw Shooter if Shooter didn't exist? I would highly recommend watching The Shining or The Dark Half over this one. Even the Ninth Gate, which wasn't the best movie, but at least had original ideas. Watching this and Dreamcatcher, I do wonder where the impish evil side of King went off to. The King who gave us Carrie, Christine, Cat's Eye and Cujo? Is he being held captive by one of his less interesting characters? :) I suppose I can at least not blame King for the screenplay. It usually was a good thing when someone else adapted his stories. Now, even that is lost. 3/10...one point for Depp, one for Turturro and one for that cool mirror/3 Depp scene.",Secret Window

Depp loses big in this flop of a movie. Though the story started off interestingly enough, it quickly lost momentum. Depp can't be blamed though. He does a great job of keeping the character of Mort interesting and dark. From the constant drunk appearance to the eerie and dark glances, he manages to create a very interesting, multi-dimensional character. However, the story dies shortly into the movie.15 minutes in I found my mind wandering and I couldn't wait for it to be over.

The plot could have been so cool, as we expected a battle between 21 JumpStreet and Mr. Shooter and I wanted to care about who was lying about the book. But I didn't care, because of what happened next... Still, this movie is far, far superior and better than Fight Club.

136,lopcar1993,A very well crafted and skilled psychological thriller,8,7 October 2009,"I've seen psychological thriller's that try to scare you more than melt your brain, this one I'm proud to say does both. It's a very, very malicious and haunting thrill machine. I t brings the very essence of how horror and Psycho thriller's are suppose to be done, not with over the top gore and CGI, but with old school conventional means.Secret Window is as sinister as it is smart it rolls along at a very steady pace and brings more to the table than what was required. It shows you what the decent into madness and utter chaos looks like, it shows you the depth and moral ambiguities of a torn man who's lost everything. With that said you can examine the physic of the mind as it cracks under extreme and constant pressure and how your choices do affect who you help, or who you hurt. This film's pace and dark style is meant to reflect horror films of the 40's, 50's, 60's and early 70's before gore became cool but that makes this film such a joy to watch and study. And that makes it a great film, not a good film, a great film.Johnny Depp( who was fantastic here.) gives a very eccentric and brilliant performance as the conflicted writer Mort Rainey, John Turturro does exceptionally well as the sinister and vicious Shooter and he almost outclasses Depp in this film. Charles S. Dutton does well with the few scenes he's. But the main let down and I think the reason for this film's poor reviews from critics were the bland and very lame performances of Timothy Hutton( he won an Oscar he can do better than this.) and Maria Bello, they really lowered the caliber and class of this film and forced Depp to try harder to make them look good and make there time on screen with him good, but he succeeds and they fail. But Turturro and Depp hold up strong.Secret Window is a very Keene and captivating psychological/horror thriller that is surefire mind boggling entertainment and out of this world fun. This movie is great rainy day entertainment or any day entertainment for that matter it's just all around a fantastic and mind boggling film that makes you question the sanity of writers and the world they live in ( speaking as one myself.) it brings to question as the thoughts in our mind really our conscious or our selves just speaking out to right the wrongs doe against us It's a film that ask those questions and then you have to answer.

138,petit76,masterpiece,10,13 July 2008,"""The only thing that matters is the ending. It's the most important part of the story. And this one, is very good."" This line, from the short story by Stephen King, and repeated with such muted insanity by Johnny Depp, is Secret Window in a nutshell.A lot of people didn't enjoy this movie, because the ending is clichéd and predictable, but I loved the rest of it because of it's true subject matter.The movie is about writing and the insanity of writers. For those of you unfamiliar with the process...imagine spending months or even years of your life working on a painting that you yourself can never see. You become so close to what you create that you have no idea if it's any good, and the growing doubt of your own ability along with the fear of wasting so much time and effort will most definitely have you pulling your hair out.That's what Secret Window captures so perfectly. It's obvious Stephen King knows exactly what's going on in Mort Rainey's mind, and Koepp, a successful and busy screenwriter, probably connected with the material for the same reason.Early in the movie, Mort walks around his house on a typical day when he's working on his latest novel. He does nothing. Sleeps. Talks to his dog. Then finally sits down at the typewriter and writes a single paragraph. He then reads it, realizes it's bad writing, and deletes it. But he does it with a SMILE. And he goes back to sleep happy, because he DID something on that day.That's the world that Mort Rainey, as a serious writer, lives in. Completely obsessed with trying to paint a blind masterpiece, and scared to death of failure. So you can imagine that when Mort finally completes something that he's proud of, it goes down as one of the great days in his otherwise nervous and stressful existence.And King has magnified the situation, by stripping our writer of everything else that might make him happy. Mort's personal life is a complete mess. His wife has left him for another man (a subplot staged with perfect awkward bitterness), he has no friends and is living alone in a cabin in the woods. So Mort is a writer and nothing else. The only thing he has left is the hope of his latest novel. And that naturally takes all his effort and gives him nothing but stress and doubt in return. So the only thing that can possibly be keeping him going is his previous work. The satisfaction that comes from having climbed the mountain in the past and created something that truly makes him proud.And THAT is when the horror begins. Our villain appears, and accuses Mort of plagiarizing one of his previous stories. (If you've followed my description to this point, your stomach should turn a cartwheel at this moment.) Shooter threatens Mort's life, and Mort is left trying to find an original copy of the story to prove to his stalker (and perhaps himself) that he does have a shred of value as a human being.And of course, as the story goes on...we get a full exploration of the affects of immersing yourself in a fictional world. It goes on to show the paranoia and madness that can come from men when they don't have the steady influence of reality to keep them anchored.The ending of the story is very predictable and cliché, but I can forgive it, because it is a total natural for this material. Secret Window is a perfect examination of the inner madness that exists in people who create subjective art for a living. Depp's performance is pitch perfect, and people who understand the situation will most likely love this.If you aren't, however, you won't be able to identify.Evren Buyruk from USA",Secret Window

Mort says he can prove he wrote his first, but while Mort digs around for the magazine which published the story in question years ago, things begin to happen.The lead actors are both exceptional talents and Mario Bello as Mort's soon to be ex-wife Amy, matches them. Depp is the good looking young writer that King wishes he once was. Make no mistake there is a huge amount of King himself in this story. This is a story written about the writing process, and particularly the method King uses of immersing himself in the character and the location, and allowing the story to evolve painstakingly form his deepest subconscious. 'You were gone, up in your head' as Amy said.The cinematography is beautiful, and the score unobtrusive. There is just the right amount of suspense. This is a very classy horror/thriller.

141,richard-wheeler,"""Secret Window, Secret Garden"".",7,28 December 2005,"Once again, Johnny Depp took the lead as main actor. The story was about a divorced man who was a writer and he lived close to the river. His name was Mort Rainey. And six months later, he stole a story from John Shooter (John Torturro) called ""Sowing Season"" when his house keeper Mrs.Garvey (Joan Heney) followed by a story called ""The Secret Window"". Rainey took the two stories and he mixed them into one.Oh! There was such a chilling moment when Rainey dreamed that he fell off a cliff. It was a LONG way down! And there was a horrific scene when Rainey found his dog Chico dead because Shooter murdered it with a screw driver. Shooter did that because, he wanted his story back.Soon, Rainey started to hallucinate. For example, Rainey thought he saw Shooter in his house when it was just a mouse. And then, he started to look like a nut case. He used to open his mouth and tense his jaw. And when morning came, he found a hat outside his door. And he also found Tom Greenleaf (John Dun-Hill) dead in a four-wheel drive followed by a cop lying dead in the back seat. To cover up the incident, Rainey cast the bodies over a cliff into an inviting lake.Later, Rainey was looking very pale and he suddenly realized that he was doing all the murders. Suddenly, he heard a voice. It was himself and he did not leave him alone! There was another freaky scene in that moment. When Rainey threw an ashtray at the wall, it caused a crack and it grew up the wall causing the house to split open! And he could see the back of himself in the mirror. WOW! Imagination is your creation! When Amy Rainey (Maria Bello) arrived at Rainey's residence, she found pages scattered everywhere outside the house and the inside had been trashed. And ""Shooter"" were written everywhere. AH! There was another chilling moment! When Amy tried to escape in her car, she accidentally left the hand brake on and Rainey broke into the car with a rock. He then dragged Amy out into the backyard and he killed her! And when Amy's husband arrived, Rainey knocked him out with a spade and Rainey stabbed him with it!! Rainey had become the character he CREATED!!!!!!!And coming to the end,Rainey finally came up with an ending for his book. And when Rainey came into the town to shop; everyone was too afraid to speak to him! And when Sheriff Dave Newsome (Len Cariou) went to visit Rainey in connection with the bodies, but Rainey refused to tell him. But do you know WHAT?! Rainey buried the bodies in the back yard, he grew corn on them and he ate the corn! YUCK! No wonder it was also known as ""Secret Window, Secret Garden""!",Secret Window

144,veganflimgeek,Better than the novella...for real.,7,14 March 2004,"I love Stephen King. I love David Koepp who I think is a under rated director. While secret window is far from a perfect film it is a fun horror movie that has a few well done scares and improves on the novella. That is right a rare case where the story was improved. Koepp is no fool, but it takes guts to change the story of a man who is possibly the best living American writer of popular fiction.A lot of reviews have been accurate in crediting this film on Depp's shoulders. I would agree with out this film would not have been nearly as good. In fairness though one most remember casting is a huge part of directing.  Koepp who recently worked with David Fincher on panic room learned some visual tricks from him and that is clear in the opening credits.Koepp took a short story that does have much too it and made a fun horror film.************Spoilers***************** What I don't understand is how Stephen king can every once and a while write books so close to other projects. Christine was basically the shining with a car instead of a hotel. Secret window is just a stripped down version of the dark half. Ok so it's a little different but it's all in his head, where DH had the whole sparrows and twin thing but still.The ending was a improvement on King's story. Lets face King some hearts is two nice a guy to kill off certain characters he admitted his anguish over killing the child in pet sematary . Koepp had more at stake making this film than king would writing another novella, so it stands to reason he would feel more compelled to get it right.I wonder if King is happy.

145,cheathamg,Serious narrative flaw,6,21 January 2007,"There are spoilers in this review because I want to discuss some basic flaws that relate to the very structure and point of the story, the climax of which is supposed to come as a shock surprise. The concept of the story is that a writer, Johny Depp, is confronted by a man who claims to have written a short story that Depp has stolen. Depp at first denies any involvement in a plagiaristic act. He then begins to doubt himself, apparently because he once did commit an act of plagiarism. That's one of the first flaws, or clues, to the nature and failure of the story. How can an author not be aware of whether or not he stole a story? Another is that when Depp tells the averred author, played by John Tuturro, that the story originally appeared in a magazine prior to the date which he claims to have written it, Tuturro asks incredulously how in the world would it be possible to prove such a claim. It would the simplest thing in the world for Depp to tell him to go to a public library and look it up, but somehow that course of action never occurs to this professional writer. This becomes a plot turn later when Depp has his own personal copy of the magazine mailed to him only to discover that the pages the story is on have been cut out. Anyway, suffice it to say, there are several unlikelihoods that can only be explained by the denouement that Tuturro's character is actually Depp in a state of personality disintegration. This is the single most important failing of the story. If a character is going mad in a story, the reader/viewer needs to know that up front. When that fact is used to explain away inconsistencies, then it becomes deus ex machina. Shock and horror are not enough to make a competent narrative, even for Stephen King. In The Shinning, the character is going mad and everybody knows it all along. It works regardless of whether or not the ghosts are real. When an author hides a crucial fact, it makes the story weak. It's as simple as that.",Secret Window

The story follows a writer with damaged mind. He sees strange things, he remembers something strange that has happened before. Strange man accuses him in plagiarism and his life is now officially a nightmare. So, the plot is not that bad. King's novel has inspired David Koepp in making this movie and we know, who King is. But there is something missing in the movie. There are some messed up elements. For example, just when you are on the edge of your seat, Mort wakes up and a big drama with his ex-life and her present husband, begins and it lasts 15 minutes. Chaotically made scenes but at least Depp's performance is the best thing in the movie. Of course, he has at least 5 better performances but this is not a bad one.

In the woods he has hit a writing block. One day a stranger comes to see him, with him he brings a story he wrote 7 years ago, the story is almost identical with a famous story Mort Rainey wrote, the stranger, John Shooter, wants Mort to either prove that he wrote the story first or write the ending as it should have been done properly.I'm quite a big Stephen King fan, but that doesn't mean that i always enjoy the adaptions of his books, in fact i think many of them is a disgrace to the books, King has a fantastic style when writing. Something that apparently is extremely hard to adapt in a proper way, last one i saw was Dreamcatcher, which was one of the worst ones ever to be seen. And i saw it directly after i've read the book. With Secret Window on the other hand, i'd never read the book, but from the plot i can see that it's something Stephen King has been working with before, but i held my head high and went on to see the movie.And this does have a real Stephen King touch, at least the storyline has a feeling of King over it, and that is basically what drives this movie forward in an interesting way, the storyline is very good and interesting. But this movie wouldn't work without John Torturro and Johnny Depp in the leading roles, especially Depp is outstanding as the writer who's trying to overcome his sorrow by sleeping his days away. Torturro also shines as the psychopath that is haunting Depp, and together they are really making a strong team, a team that is the heart and soul of this movie, because the directing isn't too good.This movie is supposed to be a psychological thriller, and it is, it's interesting at least, but it's far from scaring anybody. For that, I think there is just simply missing atmosphere in the movie, if it hadn't been for Depp and Torturro and the general storyline, this movie wouldn't have worked at all. David Koepp can thank Stephen King for a great background story, and he can thank Torturro and Depp for bringing 100% atmosphere of the movie. The twist in the end is also strong, it really is a strong twist, but we see it all coming long before. Basically because the hints that are given are at times maybe too obvious, but also because we have seen this before.The Dark Half anyone? The basic storyline of these two are very much alike, but this doesn't make this story less interesting. When it all comes down to it all, i think David Koepp have made an enjoyable adaptation of a real genius work, the movie has some flaws, it lacks depth and atmosphere, but overall it works out pretty well, and i really liked it.7/10",Secret Window

In my opinion you have to decide if these few minutes really could destroy the integrity of the sheer quality which came before it. And second, the ending itself is (technically) incredibly well made, and fascinating to watch. The only weak part is the motivation of the character.This review is marked as a spoiler-review, so you are warned:In the end it is revealed that the whole story centered around the antagonist of the story, because the protagonist and the antagonist are the same person (i know, who ever used this kind of twist, right?). The idea on itself is fascinating, and the scenes before also make sense despite it, BUT the reason why most people don't like it, seems to be the motivation of the character. It's not really clear WHY he has such a big psychological problem, we know that his wife cheated on him, but that's never enough for a person to get that mad and on this kind of murder-rampage, in which he even kills people who tried to help him, and who he really liked.To come to a conclusion: Secret Window is a very well made Mystery- Thriller, with a weak ending.

Mort (Johnny Depp), a writer who is obviously a complete mess, answers, and is confronted by a guy calling himself ""John Shooter"" (John Turturro). Shooter claims that Mort stole his story, which he immediately denies. Shooter keeps coming back and harassing him. Meanwhile, Mort is going through a divorce, because his wife (Maria Bello) cheated on him with a guy named Ted (Timothy Hutton).Basically, we jump into Mort's point of view in the very beginning, and we only exit that point of view in the end. This is when we come to realize just how differently he sees things than they really are. I won't spoil it too much though.The ending is amazing. I was truly shocked. One of the best endings I have ever seen. On top of that, this movie made me do something very rare, and that is **SPOILER** cheer for Mort when he bashes in the brains of his cheating wife and her new boyfriend. It made me want them dead. It twisted my emotions so that if the kills didn't happen, I would have been disappointed. It fulfills the viewer in a sick way. Now that's what I call quality directing and acting.

The movie suffers from a shallow script that leaves enough clues in the first 25 minutes to make the viewer have to painfully sit through the next 80 minutes.As usually, Depp is wonderful and he and his hair (it performed an act all on its own) makes you believe in his quarky character.

Hats off to a fine actor and a beautiful location selected by the director.Unfortunately, this is one of those by-the-numbers movies we have seen a thousand times.

Len Cariou is a fine character actor but his role as the fumbling sheriff is a disgrace to a talented man that won a Tony and made over 35 movies.While an admirer of Steven King, the ending is very King and no surprise to the viewer. King's novels can be great works of art but translating them to movies has shown us more failures than successes (too many to name).

154,med_1978,Another excellent performance by Depp is the only high point.,5,29 December 2008,"I watched this film yesterday as I have admired a lot of Johnny Depp's acting performances over the years, this film is no exception. Depp turned in another great performance as Mort Rainey, a writer whose life seems to be in a bit of a downturn. His wife has left him and now lives with another man with whom Depp does not get on at all (who does get on with their ex's new partner anyhow). He lives a reclusive lifestyle in a cabin by a lake with his dog and basically just drinks sleeps & writes (although not too much of the latter at this stage).Then things go from bad to worse when a man calling himself John Shooter turns up (played well by John Turturro). The man is extremely upset that Mort has plagiarised one of his own pieces of writing. Up to now this is a decent thriller indeed but then something happens and things start to get a bit implausible. I won't spoil the details of the remainder of the story for you (although many other reviewers probably already have by now). But to me I just found nothing new in the second half of the film and the ending seemed utterly ridiculous and disappointing. Still I would not say this remains a very watchable film due to Depp's turn. John Turturro was not bad either, but the rest of the cast could have been played by any other actors and been just as good or better.I have to say I expected more from this film but it was still an entertaining enough thriller and worth watching. 5/10",Secret Window

My biggest complaint about this movie is that it is not a new concept. There are multiple movies and stories about people writing stories getting sucked into them.  It certainly has the King direction to it, but it is still a copy of others. Has King run out of new ideas?  Maybe, maybe not.In summation, good, not great movie.  Without Depp, it probably fails.

But everything may not be as it seems. As long as you're cool with movies that have no likable characters, you should enjoy this movie fairly well. There's some creepiness and mystery - no doubt about it. When it comes to the plot twists and the vantage point from which the story is told, however, this film cannot measure up to ""Identity.""

In fact, up until about the last 10 minutes of the film I was preparing to give it a 6/10 i.e 3* (good). However, during the last ten minutes the film takes a major nose dive in that it doesn't seem to know how to end without simply bumping off all the characters and leaving Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) to carry on his merry way into some kind of mental breakdown/psychosis. Even the local sheriff gives him a pass and somehow fails to acquire the search warrant that would surely have lead to Mr Rainey's new vegetable patch being dug up, hence unearthing Mrs Rainey and her insipid lover Ted. Anyway, like I said I thought this film was good up until the last 10 minutes - even the twist, albeit a well tried and tested one in Hollywood. However, the way in which Mr Rainey simply lost the plot after this i.e got braces/straightened his hair, and got away with everything even though the townsfolk were repulsed by him, made what was quite an earnest film a really really daft one. It was enjoyable hitherto, and I really enjoyed the creepy, yet quite cosy feel to the movie. Depp held the majority of the film together well, whilst the rest of the cast fulfilled their end of the bargains too. So, if you want to see this film, then I recommend you do as it is OK, just don't expect the ending to live up to the initial premise.",Secret Window

I admit I am a hopeless Johnny Depp fan and while I'm not a fan of Stephen King, good is good and Johnny is good. He gave his character all the depth, wit and charisma it deserved. Turturro was also excellent as the cheated author of a book he claimed Johnny took credit for.Like it or not, Johnny Depp is a major actor with a unique style and is showing us how he portrays characters from all walks of life.

Mr. Rainey is in the process of getting a divorce and, apparently, he's having troubles getting any writing done.  To further complicate matters, Rainey is accosted by John Shooter (Torturo) -- he claims that Mr. Rainey stole his story.  From there, Mr. Rainey is terrorized by Shooter -- until Rainey can prove he wrote the original version of the story.

Yup, Mr. Rainey _was_ Shooter.  He was simply having a psychotic episode!  Oh wow!  Isn't that clever!  As I mentioned before, I found all three of these movies to be very entertaining -- until the end, when you realize that none of what happened in the movie actually happened (to a lesser or greater extent).  In ""Identity"" it was psychosis... in ""The Swimming Pool"" it was actually the story the main character was writing... In ""Secret Window"" it appears to be combination of the two.To me the whole thing seems very much like a cop-out.

The film stays very true to the novella. I am a die-hard King fan, I own over 20 of adaptations and his books. The only real differences I remember is the fact that Mort had a cat named Bump, the titles of Shooter's and Rainey's stories were changed (Mort wrote Sewing Season and Shooter wrote Secret Window, Secret Garden while in the film they traded titles) and the fact that the ending is changed.Johnny Depp gives a solid performance.

One day, a man named John Shooter (John Turturro) shows up and claims that Mort stole his story and claimed it as his own. At first Mort ignores Shooter's threats, but Shooter proves that he is not one to be toyed with--targeting first Chico, and eventually teasing Amy and the man she left Mort for, Ted (Timothy Hutton). Mort is shaky about Shooter's actions, but refuses to let his guard down and willing to fight with him till the end.This movie is a pretty smart thriller. Though most of the scares in this movie are highly predictable, the tension is built up incredibly well. In fact, even in moments in which I knew what was coming (i.e. Chico), I found myself nervous and tense, awaiting the exact moment it would come. And I can honestly say that I didn't know about or expect the twist in the plot until it was spelled out to me--that may be pathetic on my part, but I really didn't see it coming. The pinnacle of the film is very thrilling and unsettling, and a great conclusion. The rest of the scenes following the twist are very well-crafted and spooky, namely the ending, which managed to be funny and freaky all at once.SECRET WINDOW is a pretty good psychological thriller. Of course anything with Johnny Depp in it is going to be fun, and this is no exception. Though his role is pretty dramatic, he manages to capture Mort Rainey's complexities and add a lot of personality to the character, delivering many good humorous moments as well. It needn't be stated that Johnny Depp is a fantastic actor. John Turturro is also good and genuinely creepy as John Shooter, Mort's pursuer. Maria Bello and Timothy Hutton both do well in supporting roles.The direction and cinematography are both great as well. I noticed a lot of Hitchcockian references in the camera angles (like the angle of Mort climbing the stairs), which I liked. The scenes are all put together well, I thought. I don't quite understand why people seem to be so down on this movie. Or maybe I'm biased in thinking that Johnny Depp can do no wrong.SECRET WINDOW is a fun, spooky, smart psychological thriller.

Maybe just a little TOO high.This had a menacing nature to it as most of King's stories do, and the entire film kept you guessing, all while slowly feeding you information and clues that progressed the story. It tells of a successful author named Mort Rainey (played by Depp) who is living alone following a separation from his wife. One day, he suddenly hears a knock on his front door, and opens it to find another author by the name of John Shooter, who claims that Mort ""stole"" his story that he wrote. When Mort insists such things did not happen, he shrugs off the events involving the strange man and moves on with his life. But John Shooter will stop at nothing for ""justice"" and the lengths he goes to over the course of the film for it are shocking.This had a big surprise of an ending that if you are like me, you will not see it coming.

I suspect that parody was the original intention, but this film takes itself with absolute seriousness -- not that there isn't comedy in it, but seriousness about its conviction that the plot's twists are going to surprise the audience. Surprisingly none of the story line ever does conclude with any action that was promised earlier. The ""steaming corn"" analogy (ironically appropriate) used throughout the screenplay stays til the picture's final shot of a cornfield: if this allusion is to Children of the Corn, then at least Stephen King is ripping off himself for a change.I'd thought of doing a ""spoiler"" review in which I could discuss the film's points in more  detail.

Depp of course can play everything from a young man with scissors for hands, to Captain Jack Sparrow.This is a well traveled terrain for Stephen King as well. He has made a career out of portraying the hell that one can create in the skull alone. Living alone in the boonies is in some ways very peaceful and idyllic but in other ways it can be a very hair-raising and creepy experience. The same solitude can be a house of horrors as one dissolves in paranoia. We have seen the enemy and the enemy is ourselves, seems to be the theme. As with the story ""The Shining"", ""Gerald's Game"" being alone in the woods can be unkind to the imagination, especially if one lives by one's imagination.

188,NxNWRocks,Middle-of-the-Road Adaptation,5,9 August 2004,"Seemingly there's been a rule in effect in Hollywood for a while now that anything bearing Stephen King's name must be adapted for the screen.  Right now, a studio exec is probably examining King's credit card statements with view to a possible mini-series.  The rule has lead to some clunkers, especially from short stories, but here it pans out - just.  ""Secret Window"" is based on a novella-length story, which gives David Knoepp a little more of a fleshed-out basis with which to work.  The story is simple enough, but King manages to keep in intriguing enough to last the course, and the ending arrives somewhat unexpectedly.  This is also largely true of the adaptation.Depp turns in a very fine, almost understated performance as a writer going through a messy divorce and taking refuge from the world at large in his lakeside cabin.  The world intrudes on the relative calm in the sinister shape of John Turturro, bringing with him an accusation of plagiarism and an implied threat of impending violence if the wrong is not righted.  The gist of the film is Depp's struggle to clear his name and get rid of the stranger, who in the meantime ramps up the threats.So far, so good, and while there are subtle clues dangled for those who know the story, the majority of the film walks a steady line between maintaining the suspense and having not too much of anything actually happen.  When it comes, the denouement is handled badly by Knoepp, both in the writing and direction.  This detracts from the film, but there is enough in Depp's performance, and the movie in general, to warrant it as a solid, though unremarkable, piece of work.  As far as King adaptations go, this would be just shy of the greatest works, but certainly above the clunkers.",Secret Window

They told me that it wasn't something that I should waste any time or money on seeing, because I would be utterly disappointed. However, I loved this movie! It was beyond my expectations by far. As for the people that say that the ending was predictable, I strongly disagree. I never suspected it the least bit. A writer named Mort sees his wife sleeping with another man and secludes himself in a lake house where he lives like a slob and never cuts his hair. He is confronted by a man named John Shooter who claims that Mort stole his story. He also says that he wrote his story in the year of 1997, when Mort wrote his in 1994. Mort does the best he can to drive the man away, but a series of incidents and eventually murders keep happening every time he makes an attempt. The final showdown is awesome and a wicked twist, and I believe that you won't ever guess correctly before the end of the movie, but there is one thing that someone wrote in a review that I agree with. The twist is something that has been being used too often in suspense thrillers lately, and hopefully that doesn't give any clues. I was very impressed with this movie, and I think that it was an awesome idea and overall, an awesome movie. I love Johnny Depp as an actor anyway, and this definitely is one of his best pieces of work.9/10!",Secret Window

Most of what he writes is too freaky and violent for me.  What goes on in that man's head truly scares me. It still does.But, I went to see Johnny Depp, so I stayed. I thought he was amazing as the deranged Mort Rainey, and I didn't see any hint of Jack Sparrow as others have mentioned, although I do think he had affectations for this character also.  Secret Window, secret garden sounds like such a pleasant thing, not so.  I was grateful for some of the more humorous moments, who says mental illness can't be entertaining.  The ending, although vaguely unsatisfying.....I'm not sure why...John Shooter keeps talking about ""a steaming potful of corn"".  Macabre, yes, Creepy, yes. Surprising no.  But I really liked this crazy character and was saddened by what the story ending revealed although I knew the minute I heard the second ""Pilgrim"" that the ending was inevitable.  I guess I didn't want it to be true.  And I was entertained, for the most part... which is all I usually ask.  I just thought with a tighter story, this could have been an amazing psychological thriller, the story did not do justice to Depp's performance. Go for Johnny.

I thought the acting was good and everything seemed to happen at the right time which kept me entertained. I thought there was a few bad points but to me the good weighed out the bad, I was surprised how good it was because there wasn't much hype about it and reading on IMDb not many people seemed to have liked it, i didn't even know what it was and have never heard about it until my friend told me about it and since there was nothing else at the movies worth seeing i thought i will watch it. overall i thought Secret Window was a good movie and i recommend it.",Secret Window

Cinematography and music is very alright. The acting perfect - Turturro and Depp as always. Then the story - of course the concept of dissociative identity disorder is pretty popular right now and overall not really original but still very enjoyable. The story is suspenseful and interesting wanting us to see the ending.""(The Ending) is the most important part of the story"" is a line repeated a few times in the movie. I couldn't agree more. So why did they have to ruin it?And I'm not talking about the story. I'm saying that the movie should end after the main character kills his ex-wife, camera moves back showing the lake house from some distance and in the background the lines from the book are repeated. The lines that even he will forget about the fact that he killed her. Then the black screen and the credits. That WOULD be a perfect ending.But no, they had to add a part where Sheriff comes and tells him that he's gonna go away soon, so it can be pg-13.

It is also brilliant to see John Turturro who plays a hick-maniac, getting good exposure to the masses.Throw all this together with a solid story line, nice enough (if not hugely creative) photography and you have a Cape Fear of the 00's. There is however, one big butthe remaining 15 minutes of the film, the Director; David Koepp screws up the ending and we have a film much more reflective of Fight Club.I was so irritated, I felt like slapping him around the face.

195,tetractys,Not much to look at,5,22 April 2007,"Despite some glaring flaws, not the least of which is the obvious payoff, this movie is worth watching for the performances and artistry. It's a Stephen King vehicle, and much better done than the awful Dream Catchers that's been in rotation on cable.OK, I'm going to talk about the use of the schizoid dissociation that has been all the rage in movies the last few years. Starting with the Hitchcock classic Psycho, it's been a venerable crime fiction device to lead the reader along on a search for a bad guy doing terrible things until it becomes clear the protagonist is himself doing all the terrible things. Predating the seminal Fight Club, there was a minor British youth caper film with the same theme (whose name escapes me). In this flick, the hero suffers watching his Doppelganger rape his girlfriend, lead him into more and more violent episodes and so on until he suffers the exact same injury as his nemesis and figures out the one-trick this pony knows. That's the problem with movies like Fight Club, Identity and Secret Window -- there isn't much else to hold the viewer after it becomes clear the hero is the bad guy with dissociative personality disorder.At least we have the delightful Johnny Depp to watch, and he does a fine job. Timothy Hutton plays a good/bad guy with alacrity, but doesn't have much to work with, and one wonders why he took the part. It's small. One problem with most King stories is that they wander all over the place without regard to story -- they're picaresque with little purpose, or the ""one damned thing after another"" brand of story-telling. Here, at least, the major plot elements do contribute to the story line.Locations add to the interest here, and the cabin where most of the story takes place is a character in itself. It's a cozy spot, and worth securing the plans for. Unfortunately, it's probably the most richly developed character, because once you figure out Depp is doing all the mayhem, and that should be inside of 20 minutes, there isn't much else to draw your attention except to see how the director handles the elements.",Secret Window
196,harishprakashhp,Remain true to the book. Pleeeeeeeeeeease.,6,29 June 2008,"I read the book and then saw the movie starring Johnny Depp. I must confess the movie is a disappointment, for tampering the story written by Stephen King.For an avid King fan the story holds all the essence. I don't ask for a replica of every word written to be a movie. Capturing the essence is all that I ask from the movie makers. Two wonderful movie makers who have done that are Rob (Stand by Me aka the Body) and Frank (The Shwshank Redemption, The Green Mile and The Mist). I immensely enjoyed reading these books and took pleasure in watching the characters being transcended into the silver screen.Spoilers from Book and Movie Mort wallowed in his own guilt. A guilt that was more than his wife Amy cheating on him. This is what the book says.Mort wants to change a particular ending of a story that'll eventually end in vengeance of Amy. The Movie.The book end in the protagonist's death with a clear ending of open speculation of whether it was all in the mind or the ghost. Book.The protagonist got what he wanted the revenge and gets away carefree. Movie.What the movie makers did was entwining the story by changing things they thought would be more apt to the movies title. The truth is the title (Secret Window, Secret Garden) has nothing to do with the Writers problems and sufferings. He succumbs to his depression and eventually the story Secret Window, Secret Garden (that is quite a different one from what he usually writes) becomes an obsession. Writers Plagiarism is what it's all about. The movie makers couldn't understand this simple fact.Remain true to the book. Pleeeeeeeeeeease.",Secret Window
197,jasonsurety,more Depp than depth,7,20 March 2004,"This review may reveal plot details undesirable for those who have not seen the movie.Has anyone compared Johnny Depp's last three performances in The Pirates of the Caribbean, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, and now Secret Window, to Marlon Brando's in A Street Car Named Desire or On the Waterfront?  The two do not necessarily share the same individualizing characteristics(although they do have a few inherent similarities), but both brought something virtually unidentifiable to the screen for these films.  Several other actors have peculiarities that are intriguing and help account for their appeal, but I think these two share some common element I have yet to define.
Secret Window banks on Depp's charm for most of its allure.  It turns out to be a good investment.  While the film lacks originality, it is entertaining. The story borrows from previous movies, especially Fight Club.  Still, the plot is not vacant, and some memorable moments are presented in a glib manner that adds uniqueness.  The movie concerns a writer who has recently discovered his wife's infidelity and is now living alone in a secluded cabin.  The writer(Depp) is having trouble coming up with ideas for a new story and spends much more time lying around on his couch, in cloths that have not been changed for quite awhile, than he does actually writing.  These scenes would seem empty without Depp there to draw you in.  The conflict begins when a Mississippi dairy farmer(John Turturro) shows up accusing Depp of stealing a story written years earlier.  From here, Turturro becomes more threatening and Depp becomes more scared and confused. The antagonist assures Depp he will involve his wife.  Depp acquires help from the local sheriff and a bodyguard.  There is a major plot twist that becomes apparent at some point in time.  The moment in which it does depends on your level of attention.  There are several references made to other stories that are correlative. There is deliberate foreshadowing throughout the film.  The director(David Koepp) is obviously not going for a total shock with the ending.  Suspense is gained because once we figure out bits of the mystery, we are surprised by something off the wall.  Johnny Depp is certainly thrusting the art of acting somewhere new, which elevates this movie above its otherwise mediocrity.",Secret Window

All of the actors, the script, the set designs were superb. Definitely a must see film. It definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat through the entire film.

Johnny Depp remains a rather overrated actor, but at least he injects some fun into this mess.

204,CarPort1,Almost Good,6,1 July 2005,"I gave this movie a 6/10 because, with a little reworking, it could have been really good. It left me with a lot of questions which might be answered by a repeat viewing, director's commentary, or perhaps reading the original story. Problem is: I'm not inspired enough after the first viewing to do any of the above. I read through some other reviews and didn't see my issues addressed so I'll state them here. Maybe it was just me not paying enough attention, but that says something to me about my tepid interest in the film in the first place.There seems to be no explanation why Depp's character doesn't seem to have a cellphone, email or internet access (although he has a laptop). (Although it makes sense in the book since it takes place a decade or so earlier.)The Talking Heads references were cool but inexplicable (Once in a Lifetime, Burning Down the House).Depp's character was named Morton Rainey. At the end of the movie he buys a box of Morton's salt with the slogan ""When it rains, it pours."" The box is shown twice but that's about it. Was it supposed to mean something? Like maybe his name was a pseudonym and this was the inspiration?And when the sheriff shows up at the end stating that when they find the bodies, Depp will be in big trouble: Okay, the bodies in the truck might take a while to find, but the wife buried in the ""secret"" garden shouldn't take much sleuthing, right?Perhaps someone paying more attention than I did will decipher these little quirks. Oh, and in conclusion: as much as I like Johnny Depp, his subtle attempts at levity in this film just didn't work. He should have skipped it.

It's only David Koepp's 6th outing as a director and he should probably stick to screenplays; it's pretty stock directing. Johnny Depp sleepwalks through this role - I guess he needed a paycheck. Most of his choices of movies are reliable but not here - he doesn't even look good, all scraggly. The rest of the cast is equally boring with the exception of John Turturro who does a good job with the hackneyed lines he's been given.

Stephen King's thoughtful tale of pressure and madness has a downbeat but appropriate ending. The film has taken that and turned into a sadistic, unbelievable slasher-trash movie. At times the climax is so bad it delves into gory camp. It's easy to understand why this loser tanked at the box office. Also, the plot twists and turns which worked in the novella are delivered in a ham-handed manner that strains the credulity of the viewer. The only positive for this flop is John Tuturro's creepy John Shooter, but he's not in the film long enough to matter.",Secret Window

Back to where I was, the plot got going, and then Johnny Depp goes all 'multiplicity' on us. What the hell was that all about!?! And then, it turns out it's him. Sounds like another, yet much better, film I've seen a few times called Fight Club. I'm a huge Johnny Depp fan.

Very unoriginal and uninteresting.",Secret Window
219,misteme2003,"A Mediocre Stephen King adaptation, Depp is phenomenal - may contain spoilers",7,25 October 2004,"OK, first you should know, this is based on a Stephen King novel. So, expect to NOT be surprised, and perhaps predict the movie before it ends and reveals itself. With that said, sit back and enjoy the thing. Take it for what it is, a psychological thriller. Nothing more, nothing less. Depp is phenomenal but after POTC, he has a tough act to follow and if you give this movie some thought, he delivers. He's still his quirky self, but in a domesticated role. His personality shines through and adds a touch of spark to this complex character.While I can usually predict a movie, this one did surprise me and the clues were there, but I believe because, as a huge Depp fan, I was too engrossed in his style to pick up on the clues to the truth of the movie...so I was quite surprised to find out what was really going on.I've seen some of King's movies, but have yet to read his novels. However, the movie delivers what some of what it promises and that's suspense and thrills, ""horror"" being questionable? I was actually less ""scared"" the more the movie and story revealed itself. But because of Depps abilities as an actor, I was still hooked. Basically this is a movie about a jilted husband (Depp's character, Mort Rainey, who's a novelist) who's accused of plagiarism by a strange man who arrives at his secluded cabin one day (Shooter, played by John Turtorro, who did a fantastic job...accent and all, creepy indeed) We're given a bit of Mort's history with his failed marriage and where it's heading...towards his self destruction. But the events that unfold with Shooter, the creepy writer who appears from nowhere, allows for a believable twist. We are brought into the mind of a schizophrenic who is actually suffering from hallucinations and delusions. And we find he's unable to control his murderous thoughts and desires. He lives in his own reality and he himself is unable to separate fact from fiction as we see when he's revealed. I gave this movie a 7/10* mostly for Depp's acting which is always superb...but it does lack in certain areas..It could have been MORE scary since it was depicted as a horror film and I wouldn't quite put it in that category, it doesn't elicit the horror like some films such as ""Silence of the Lambs"" or ""Seven""..or even Stephen King's ""The Shining"" (but that's a tough act to follow too) and the movie could have been less predictable (although I fell for it) many I've spoke to who've seen it were disappointed to have ""figured it out"" early on. A friend I watched it with started commenting during the film (as we watched it on my 55 inch surround sound TV) that ""this can't be right"" and ""no way would that happen"" before the ""secret"" window was opened, however where I thought he was wrong, was that...in a deranged mind affected by schizophrenia, what is right?

From the very outset, I was disappointed that the score sounded a bit too much like Carpenter's (?) cult classic ""The Fog"".  At other points, the music was overly dramatic, to the point of really leading the viewer, and giving away that something was about tho happen. Anyway, the problems go deeper than the score.

I guess the same logic could apply. Writing can be stressful to a writer when he leaves a story unfinished. Life itself is plain stressful just on its own. But an active imagination and a lonely writer can be deadly when life starts to stress you out. Your mind starts to write its own story and sometimes the lies begin to become real or do they? Reality and imagination can become a blur. Conversations you have in the world around you seem so real and things you do begin to seem like pages out of a story. This film keeps you guessing all the way through as to what will happen next. The characters all create a wonderful cast of believable settings and you find yourself involved into the story from start to finish.

However, to my delight, i was pleasantly surprised.We didnt sit in the cinema and say ""Wow. that was the best film ever"", but we neither were we left thinking ""That was a load of ***t"".
The acting was to a reasonable standard, and Johnny Depp was perfect for the role. The script was very clever and to say how dramatic the twist was, i think that it was concealed quite well. Although i knew what the twist was prior to seeing the movie it still took me by surprise.However, looking at the negatives,  several areas were rather weak, and if the acting hadnt stood up so well under scrutiny i dont think that i would have enjoyed it as much. Shooter was truely convincing and as ever Johnny could be relied on to add something that seemed to be lacking.Additionally, the movie was supposed to be a thriller. Admittedly there were aspects that freaked me out and made me jump, but on the contrary, there were times when i was left laughing. For someone who is easily scared this was quite strange.On the whole, this was not the best adaptation of a Steven King novel, but it did not deserve the dismal reviews that it got.

If you pay any amount of attention to the film every twist and turn in this film is anything but a twist and turn. It is everything you expect.

'Secret Window' has moments of pure hilarity, and a constant undertone of sardonic mockery and satire.

Overall, the film does a good job at disguising the real plot behind soapy thriller themes; when you realize what's been going on all along, you realize it was a better movie than it seemed; the plot gaps are a part of the plot.

For example, when he shouts 'I'll get you for this Shooter!' and you just hear his voice ringing through the twilight forest: the awkward timing and stereotypical clunkiness are MORT's version of how this scene happened.

Spoilers.",7,20 March 2004,"In ""Secret Window"" (from Stephen King's ""Secret Window, Secret Garden"" short story) Mr. Depp develops another unique character, Mort Rainey. Mort is a writer with writer's block whose life is unraveling in many directions at once.  Who hasn't been there?  He compensates with, specifically, Mountain Dew--the classic overdose of caffeine--and Doritos for carbs.  He backslides into smoking.  And he lives wrapped in a thick, cushy robe--but its shoulder is ripped.  And that is our first red herring. There are others.  Depp's characterizations are at their best when he is talking to his dog and to Ted (Timothy Hutton). There is a spark and a thrill to Mort's encounters with his antagonist, Ted, that for me were the highlights of ""Secret Window"".  There is such panache evident. I know teenagers in our audience cooed out loud.  Depp has the magnetism and acting talents to build Mort's persona and to draw us into his fraying world.The screenwriter maintains suspense to a point, and herein lies the problem with ""Secret Window"".  It is pacing.  It is really spiraling along with Depp propelling it and then it just comes abruptly to a wall and dies.  The suspense is gone.  One knows the ending, almost.  There remains one last twist that is reminiscent of an early Hitchcock TV episode.  I found myself eating more popcorn and fidgeting in the seat, waiting for the film to end as I knew it would.  This short story just did not convert to film length. I cannot blame Johnny Depp's performance.  It is masterful, with thoughtful details of characterization to make us empathize with Mort and his problems. (I have a robe almost identical to the one he wore, less the rip, and I know there are days and nights when I crawl in it and wrap it around for comfort. I love this insistence on detail that Depp uses with each character he undertakes.) I agree with the person that commented that Depp's hair gave a performance of its own, too.Perhaps if Mort's wife, Amy, had been more developed and less stereotyped, additional sparks might have flown.  It was also interesting to find veteran actor/musical performer Len Cariou portraying the town sheriff.  I have fond memories of his portrayal of the title role in ""Sweeney Todd"" on Broadway.
I am certain that anyone who enjoys watching Johnny Depp and his characterizations will want to see ""Secret Window"".  The secret window is opened, allowing us to see into Mort's soul. Mort's braces on his teeth at the end--to improve his image and straighten his bite--rate right up there for Depp aficionados with the gold caps that he donned for Captain Jack Sparrow.

Eventually, he is confronted by a stranger named Shooter (with a heavy southern accent) who accuses Mort of stealing a story that he had written. What follows is the struggle between Mort and Shooter and how it affects the lives of those around them.There are a few things to like about this movie. Depp (who plays Mort) is great again and brings a lot of tics to a character that may have otherwise been extremely boring. Likewise, Turturro is brilliant and solidifies his position as one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. Even the ending of the movie is not all that bad as there is a pretty good twist. I actually predicted the ending before it happened but I've talked to other people who didn't make the connections during the movie and they thought that the ending was pretty solid.The problem with this movie is the story (or everything up to the end). The plot is very slow at times and seems to drag on. The best scenes are the interactions between Depp and Turturro. The other scenes are pretty boring for the most part.Ultimately, even the great performances of Depp and Turturro couldn't save this movie for me.

245,mikeydewsnap,"underrated, solid movie",7,21 March 2017,"Stephan King's repertoire is certainly an expansive one, though his name is almost always associated with the horror genre. On many occasions however, he has told stories less on the super-natural, and more on regular people who struggle through emotional turmoil's and how it affects their life; such is the case with his 1990 novella 'Secret Window, Secret Garden' This story would later be adapted into the screenplay by David Koepp for the 2004 thriller flick 'Secret Window'The film stars Jonny Depp as Mort Rainey, an author of numerous novellas and novels who is suffering from writers-block due to him being in the middle of making his divorce official. On top of this, one day he receives a visit by a man named John Shooter (John Turturro) who accuses his of plagiarising a novella he himself wrote some time ago. From here on out, it's up to Mort to find evidence that his own story was published before Shooter's all while being terrorised by his obsessive fellow writer.As well as writing the screenplay, this film marked Koepp's third directorial feature and has a fascinating use of juxtaposing the film's mise-en-scene. Koepp uses very warm colours in his film, putting heavy emphasis on the yellows and oranges, in order to highlight the peacefulness of the Lake-side setting. This would seem like a direct contrast to the codes and conventions of the thriller genre if it wasn't for the night time scenes. One such of these scenes, includes having a fog roll in while a confrontation is taking place between Mort and Shooter. This leads to one of the most intense moments in the movie only second to the climactic finale – which ironically takes place in broad daylight.The ending of this film however, I do have mixed feelings about as it is reflected through the ending of Mort's finally completed book. This isn't the problem, the problem is that Mort's final statement is that ""the only thing that matters is the ending and this one is very good"". This makes the film feel very pretentious and self-absorbed as the ending, while clever, seems diminished when the film seems too proud of its own content – therefore becomes less effect.All in all, however, this truly is a strong picture – far more so, than any of Steven King's TV mini-series specials (such as IT) – and think it may also feature Depp's strongest ever performance in a film.",Secret Window

I guessed that there was no John Shooter pretty early on, but still found the movie absorbing enough because Depp is a masterful and compelling actor and a delight to watch, whatever the role. For those who love symbolism, (obvious) red herrings and (not so) cryptic clues (in this case), you will probably enjoy this. I could sum this all up in a brusque nutshell, if you like; Mort Rainey wanted to kill his wife when he found out she was cheating on him. 'John Shoot(her)' came along to do the job for him, because Mort didn't have the b***s to do it himself. Six stars only because Depp couldn't be boring if he tried, and you could find worse ways to spend an hour and a half.",Secret Window

Depp takes us on a ride, and while we are never sure of what is coming next, one thing is certain: we are entertained! Isn't that what movies are all about? In this day of over-analytical reviewers who can set themselves up as judge and jury for us all and shoot down a film before it in even in the theatre, I admire Depp's persistence in choosing roles that display what he is about: Excelling at his craft. Depp is an actor's actor, smart, talented, and willing to do roles that others bypass because their vanity doesn't allow them to play sometimes ugly (Jack Sparrow), vulnerable (Gilbert Grape) characters.

This movie has convinced me to stop watching adaptations of Stephen King stories. The ending was complete and utterly different from the stories ending. Nothing is explained, Mort's creation of Shooter is never explained in the movie and the reveal that all this was in Rainey's head was ridiculous. I don't know why screenwriters think they know better than Stephen King and completely change his stories. Only a rare few are true to his work. Secret Window is not one of those. If you really are interested in this story, listen to the audiobook read by James Woods. It's a heck of a whole lot better than this garbage. Go away David Koepp, go away.",Secret Window

I especially loved the scene where his ex-wife walks into the house and he emerges from behind a door with this evil look on his face. I actually got the chills. I've always prided myself with the fact that I'm a pretty good detective and so I must say that I figured out the mystery before it was revealed to the audience. It was quite a twist ending though and very well written. John Turturro also did a great job. I would love to see this film again. It was so well done. Johnny Depp is an amazing actor and so very versatile. This movie shows an entirely different aspect of his acting abilities.,Secret Window

This film is a one time deal, most likely it won't make the favorite list and it's not the type of movie that could be watched repeatedly.

I was gonna give it 3 out of 10 stars at first but added the 4th star just because of the ending. But Overall it was neither good or terrible.

He soon finds out that this man,John Shooter, is very serious about the story situation, he find s his beloved dog dead, along with a few other people. Who is this John Shooter? Does he even exist? Is Mort just plain crazy? Find the answer to all of these questions in this drama/thriller. The violence in this film is scarce but pretty graphic.

People in the theater began talking to each other mid way through the film because they knew what was going on. Sad that such great acting was wasted on such a poor plotline. There were so many was this film could have gone. It went down the most predictable path it could. Such great actors were wasted on this film.

SECRET WINDOW is a perfect 'little' thriller, well crafted, well mounted, done masterfully every step of the way. It basically has everything that a good thriller needs, & does everything with no misstep. This is one of the more pleasurable rides I had in cinema this year, & I still have a grin on my face from the pleasure it gave me. It's funny, it's witty, it's clever, it has some inventive shots , it has a beautiful Philip Glass score [subdued for his standards, but perfect for the context]... AND! AND- it has excellent acting from EVERYONE involved down to the last minor character & extra in the back. I've said this many times, & I'll say it again: Johnny Depp is a GOD! He elevates every film he's in, & he basically carries this one. Pure genius; so effortless, so natural, so funny, so... human. Respect!
I won't talk about the rest of the cast, cause they're all perfect= Turturro especially. Damn scary! All in all, though there's nothing revolutionary here, & though some may say it's a 'by the book' job, all I'll say is: it is done by a GOOD book. And by that I do not mean King's novelette [haven't read, but am intrigued now] = I mean: the book ""How to Make a Thriller That Works & Puts a Grin on Your Face"".

It's not up to the level of a movie such as the Sixth Sense or the Ring, but it's defintily a few notches above 'run of the mill' similar thrillers such as Cold Creek Manor or 'What Lies Beneath'.Perhaps this movie would have sucked without Johnny Depp, but with his performance, it all comes together and is a pretty good suspense thriller.

What was so interesting to me is that the ending of the movie is the opposite of the ending that Stephen King chose for his story from ""Four Past Midnight"". In the book, Mort Raniey is killed at the end and his wife lives. She is saved by the insurance adjuster who just happened to be coming down the driveway. The director and screenwriter chose to go a different way, and to me it worked better. It follows the story that John Shooter claimed to write, with the wife getting buried in the garden.

Though in Mr. Roger Ebert's ""2005 Movie Yearbook"" the film is given three stars out of four his review is remarkable. I look forward to seeing more of Mr. Koepp's and Mr. Depp's films in the near future and am sure that I will not be disappointed. I won't forget the supporting roles played by Mr. Turturro and Ms. Bello. Mr. Turturro's as ""John Shooter"" is excellent. His characteristics of a psycho stalker are portrayed greatly which proves he is a diverse actor from his role in ""Mr. Deeds"".

Johnny Depp easily mastered the role of Mort Rainy and he looked expeirienced as this is not the first time he has been forced to do a horror flick, Sleepy Hollow. Shooter terrified me with that one line ""You stole my story"". The script could not have been better if King HIMSELF had written it.

So I can't compare the two as yet. I thought that Johnny Depp did well in the role of Mort. He didn't seem to care what he looked like and what other people thought. But was really devastated when he found out about his wife. John Turturro played the character of John really well. You were never quite sure what he was going to do next.

There is the divorce which works on the mind of the main figure, a rather cool Johny Depp, but this can not explain everything.  How can the police know who is the killer?  I cannot say more because I do not want the reveal the ending but some people will be disappointed I guess.  The main figure is confronted with his alter ego from the start, he knocks at his door. Do we have to understand that all this was just imagination? The reference to Mississippi is there all the way with the strange accent of Shooter.

What makes this movie more than average is Johnny Depp. Bits such as his constantly ""popping"" his jaw helped to bring the character to life. That kind of motion is something that people do all the time, but it is not attractive, and not something you would expect to see the actor doing. Much of what he does is subtle- a glance of the eyes, a mannerism, and the self-deprecating humor. Of course this movie has plot holes and other problems, but I would recommend it to anyone. I actually enjoyed it more the second time I saw it. Johnny Depp makes any movie he is in better, and it is worth watching Secret Window just to see what he does with this character.

Yes, another Steven King predictable ""is this reality or is this madness"" film.   I won't give away the plot, but suffice it to say that if you've seen one of his film treatments, you'll see where this one's going long before it gets there.  I always get the feeling with King that his work would work a lot better in a thirty minute ""Twilight Zone"" than in a Hollywood feature.

Secret Garden (or Secret Window) is not one of them. Let's compare this story to The Shining, which shares the concept of a writer gone mad: In The Shining, the Overlook Hotel and the snowy Colorado mountains are key characters to the plot, particularly thanks to Kubrick's picky attention to camera angles and decor: here we have a boring suburban home in a boring small town.In The Shining, the writer's wife (and son) is constantly present, giving a great excuse to spark the writer's uncontrolled anger: here, wifey is gone with another guy and rarely ever shows up.The Shining has a strong tension build up from start to finish: here, whatever tension there is is spent in the first 15 mins -the rest is filler and the solution to the mystery is simply too obvious.Still, Depp does all he can to save the day.

In fact, the entire plot could have been squeezed into a half-hour ""Tales From the Crypt"" episode, which is what it often felt like.

There is tension, substance, atmosphere and good plot turns. And what David Koepp does best is toss in little bits of comedy and humor(even if it is pitch black) to keep the momentum of this fine film going.Koepp is a masterfilmmaker that doesn't get the credit he deserves, he should by now have his name a household name as much as M.Night (the sixth sense guy) does. He makes great films(i.e. the Trigger Effect and Stir of Echoes), and like Chris Rock says, ""ain't nuthin wrong wit dat"".Mind you this film has a solid twist in its closing act, and I wonder if the film beginning with a sequence and fast forwarding 6 months into the characters lives was a tip of the hat to M. Night's Sixth Sense, or if it was just a coincidence because I have not read the Stephen King story that this is based on.  M. Nights lead flashes forward months in  the Sixth Sense and so does Depp in this film. This is questioned because Koepp's ghost story film, Stir of Echoes, was very similar to Sixth Sense and stole a bit of that films thunder I think, because it was released about a month before it back in 1999.One thing is for sure, that Koepp is tipping his hat to Brian De Palma (a man he has worked with and learned a lot from-Snake Eyes, Carlitos Way and Mission Impossible). Its all there from acknowledgement of where the camera is in relationship to the focus of the story, to flashbacks and the mirrors playing a prominent role, we can see he was taking notes while working with De Palma. But what really stands out is the descent that Johnny Depp's character takes, it reminded me a lot of John Lithgow's role in ""Raising Cain"". It is tragic, scary and very funny.Mr. Depp does a great job. His one liners are hilarious, his ability to play many scenes all alone as his character just wastes away in the woods is really enjoyable to watch. I think he deals with isolation much better that Hanks did in ""Castaway"".  He is completely original here and the only tip of the hat may be the Hunter S. Thompson(rememeber Depp played him in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas) book you see sitting on his coffee table in the film.This is a great film that even if you are a fan of the thriller genre you will get a kick out of, even if you had big suspicions of where it will take you in the end.",Secret Window

Anyway, it was a really good movie, i think that Johnny played his part well (then again, he plays all his parts well) and John Turturro was the perfect stalker. The only downside was that it ended eventually, and as soon as you saw him put on the black hat, it was obvious that it was really just his extremely angry split personality that was killing people.

He was the one that was killing everyone. The sheriff accuses him of killing them and threatens to take him to jail when they have enough evidence. People would call this pointless but he had a reason to kill the people. Tom Greenleaf and the detective were killed because they were involved. He killed his wife that he was about to divorce because six months earlier he found her with another man. And he killed Ted because he heard Amy(Mort's wife)screaming for her life and went to check on her. Later at the end of the movie you hear Johnny Depp quoting from his book ""' I knew I could do it' he said, helping himself to another ear of corn. 'I'm sure that in time her death will be a mystery even to me'"". Early on the people making the movie zoomed out the window to the corn stock down to the roots and were originally going to have the dead bodies there but decided that that would be very gory. This is one of Johnny Depp's Best films.",Secret Window
278,DeveshKumarr,One of the best Thriller i ve ever seen,9,29 June 2020,One of the best movies I have ever seen. Johnny Depp does a great job in this movie and he did the book justice. Awesome twist at the end!,Secret Window
279,rcltasman,"Standard, predictable story with an unoriginal theme.",5,31 January 2005,"The movie has some issues. One of them is Depp's character, a person you just can't sympathize with. From the beginning of the movie, his continuous sarcastic remarks, his talking alone, his pleasure in isolation (common for certain writers, we could say), all point towards the possibility that something is very wrong with him.Then there's the story itself. The movie begins slow -- very slow. We see Depp's character lying all day on his couch, only being interrupted by the strange character played by Turturro. Then Depp goes back to sleep, and we wait. Then the housemaid interrupts him. Then, slowly, the movie begins to change its pace. Fortunately, it starts to move a little faster.As usual, when watching a thriller, the point is trying to discover the mystery. A good thriller will have you constantly reinventing the ending, and even then it will manage to surprise you with something you just didn't expect. In Secret Window, however, it is interesting that just after about 40 minutes into the 90-minute movie we all came to the same conclusions about who Shooter, really is - or better yet, what he isn't.If you have already seen David Fincher's Fight Club (a very good movie, in my opinion) or movies with a similar theme, it is possible you won't enjoy this movie. This is just more of the same - only not as complex, and just adapted to be yet another ""log cabin"" story with a very thin cast.",Secret Window

I'd rank this as a 10/10 along with Frailty, The Ring and The Exorcist. Secret Window and Frailty for their mystery/thriller plots derived from the psychological; the others more from the supernatural.Anyway, a superb performance by all involved, including Depp (who in fact delivered my favorite performance of his career).My favorite film adaptation of a Steven King work. Truly magnificent.Also, a somewhat effective pg-13/14a horror that most families could tolerate for a Halloween treat.",Secret Window
281,gaja_jezernik,Can't stop watching it,10,27 March 2007,"I believe that Secret window is one of those movies, that will last forever. What I want to say is, that it doesn't matter how many times you see it, it will always be absolutely amazing and just as exciting as the first time. Of course the whole plot is A+ material and we have to thank King for it. But still, there are differences. I really enjoyed to see that the ending is different in the movie. I read the book first I felt somewhat sorry for Mort. But in the movie, it's a completely different story. I was absolutely shocked that he killed all those people. And I couldn't get over that fact for quite a while... But still, I gave this movie a 10, because I know it by heart, the cast and crew are amazing, as is the whole story.",Secret Window
282,CptFastbreak,Mediocre King adaptation with some good acting,5,4 June 2012,"At one point in this movie, one of the characters says that a good story is all about the ending. I find that ironic coming from Stephen King because I always considered the endings the weakest parts in his stories. As a writer, he definitely knows how to build up suspense and tension, and he has some good plot ideas, but if you strip them to their bones, the plots are comparatively weak. That may be the reason why a lot of them make for very poor movie adaptations, and the greatest King adaptation of all times, The Shining, is the one that deviates most from his original story.So as you maybe glanced from this, I'm not a huge fan of Stephen King as such. I haven't read the story this is based on either, so I judge it purely on the merits of what I've seen on screen. Like so many of King's stories, it's a suspenseful thriller about an author of suspenseful thrillers (Depp). The author is going through a painful divorce while at the same time apparently experiencing a kind of writer's block, also a frequent theme of King's work. In addition, he is being stalked by a guy (Turturro) who claims he was plagiarized by him. He is being threatened by that guy and things turn increasingly violent.I don't really get how reviewers can claim that the ending was unexpected or illogical. It does make perfect sense from the movie, but if you pay the slightest attention to the clues laid out, you will indeed see it coming from miles away. To me, this was indeed the weakest part of the movie, because even though it builds up some suspenseful atmosphere, the obvious clues kind of destroy it as it is built. To me there was scarcely any doubt as to what was going on, which is a prerequisite to this kind of psychological horror movie.Having said that, it seems this isn't the worst story King ever wrote, and it's definitely by far not the worst adaptation. Depp as the main character and especially Turturro as the main antagonist act very well, and the supporting cast is also decent. The photography is beautiful, as are the set and locations. In the end, it's mainly the acting performance that added two or three stars to the score I would have assigned based on the story alone.But even if it was mostly good craftsmanship, this movie left me intellectually unsatisfied, and decidedly not scared or creeped out enough. It would make for a good watch should you happen to catch it on TV, but I wouldn't recommend buying or lending it.",Secret Window

It just makes me sad that johnny depp is in this kind of film as he's usually such a high quality film actor.  I cannot believe i saw siskel and roeper last week and they gave it two thumbs up.  I laughed at the ending not because it was clever but because of the cheesiness and stupidity of it(corny in more ways than one).  The only redeeming factor was the charismaand acting of johnny depp which made me at least not hate myself for spending my time and money - just sorry.  Don't get suckered in as it's really not worth it.",Secret Window
284,wales_42,Depp's acting makes this slow-build film a very enjoyable watch.,7,24 December 2012,"Being a fan of Depp's acting for years through the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, I chose to buy a series of his older films and this was the first to come through the post a little more than two years ago.This film is a very interesting attempt at a thriller/drama and I can't fault much of the content at all. I will try not to give away too much of the story in this review. Depp is a writer, estranged from his wife who he discovered had an affair. He's approached by a man named Shooter who accuses him of stealing a story which Depp doesn't recognize. The main positive I took from this film is that the plot completely morphs as it progresses; starting with one issue which soon becomes irrelevant in the face of another. Whilst this might suggest poor writing, let me assure that it is not. Alongside this, the acting skills of Depp are very impressive; demonstrating his ability to act in virtually any role. Whilst his character as a lazy, cynical writer might appear very easy to portray, Depp left me feeling different emotion at different times for his character: something a lot of actors have struggled to get me to do in similar roles. The ending is borderline unpredictable unless you've been following with keen eyes and ears throughout. Small hints are thrown at you without warning and its up to you to try and figure it out before it becomes obvious. Depp's character undergoes a dramatic transformation which ties up all the unexplained factors of the film, and within minutes the issues you thought were going to be solved suddenly become insignificant because you realise they were never issues to begin with. My only point to warn people wanting to watch this film is that it is a slow-build film. Whilst this is clearly the films intention and done very well, it is not a film which explains much until the very end and I'd advise against watching it if you're not a fan of stories which appear to have an ending relatively unrelated to the beginning. Personally I think the last sentence waters down the effect of the ending but I'm not sure how to word it more suitably. In conclusion, I'd recommend this film to fans of detective/thriller who want a well told story over action-packed scenes.",Secret Window
285,Turtle5729,And people thought this was good?,3,15 October 2005,"--SPOILER ALERT--SORRY IF YOU WANTED TO SEE IT-- Look, I love Stephen King stories as much as the next slightly Gothic-minded gal, but this movie did not need a screen adaptation. Then again, it could have worked with a slightly better screenplay, and, more importantly, a director that knew what he was doing.Sure, the movie starts out strong with the tense scene involving Mort (Depp, in a characteristically good performance, but with what was obviously little directorial direction) and his cheating wife, but it's all downhill from there. Yes, granted, Depp and Turturro (as Shooter) gave it their all, but a lot more could have been done with this movie. Namely, the ending sucked to say the least.It was positively non-climactic. The director just drops it on you that, hold back your gasps, Shooter is Mort's other personality dying to get out to kill his ex-wife. This could have been handled with a little more subtlety, i.e. without the ridiculous and unnecessary special effects, or even humor, like the scene in ""Fight Club."" (Yes, I'm sorry, another spoiler.) Once he kills his ex-wife, in what could have been a more frightening or dramatic scene, the movie should have ended. However, the director wanted to put yet another nail in the coffin and decides, ""Hey, I know, I'll put Johnny in braces, send him to a super-market, and have him hit on some girl. Then I'll send him back to his cottage so the Sheriff can come and tell him that everyone is just waiting to have proof that he killed his wife, and let him look oblivious to everything the guy just said with a stupid grin on his face."" Basically, I ended the movie thinking, ""What the Hell? I wanted to spend money to see it in theaters?!"" You see, the first week it came out, I was dead-set on going, but wouldn't you know, the second I walked up to the theater, a great big screen had ""SECRET WINDOW - SOLD OUT"" running across it like in a bad movie. Little did I know ""Secret Window"" was the bad movie that I wasn't meant to see.",Secret Window

I don't want to spoil it for anyone (LOTS of the other reviews contain major spoilers), but much of what goes on in this film just seems stupid, contrived, and totally unbelievable.  At no point was I involved in the story.  If you can't get to the ""willing suspension of disbelief"", you are just watching it from the outside as an exercise in film making that just didn't work.

The horror element to the film isnt frightening - and the ending is predictable.Johnny Depp i feel would play an amazing nut job and in fact shows that partly in this film - but i hope he plays a similar role in a better scripted film in the future, because although he did as much as he could with his role - the script held him back.",Secret Window

BUT, the movie still captured the essence of the book at a superb level.The main thing that fascinates me in this movie is the combination of the right amount of time it took to develop the characters, and the right amount of story development.

The movie was creepy, but not as scary as I thought it would be; which was a little disappointing.  Don't get me wrong, it still had the disturbing essence of a Steven King flick, so in that it was good.  And I just though it was a good movie, my best friend keeps reminding me that Johnny didn't look to bad either.  She is a huge Depp fan.

I must say i did predict the ending, because (King is not a saint nor the lord of the ideas) motive and the story aren't really something new and original, it has been present for centuries in literature and other art, nevertheless, i was surprised with director's solutions that have brought vibrancy and excitement in the plot and the movie itself. I shall also add that Depp's performance did half of the job. Now the main thing, the genre. Movie fits it's genre, thriller, it doesn't jump out of it in any way, it's not a horror, it's not a crime - drama, it's a thriller, as the matter of fact, it's a shiny example of that genre. Ending, the strongest part of the movie gives you something to think about, and it gives you the final thrills. Seen better and worse, so i would say the movie is... average.

295,Iron_Martyr,Secret Window was really excellent. It has become my favourite film,10,14 January 2005,"I really enjoyed Secret Window. I rented it once, then kept getting it again and again. So, eventually, my mum had to buy it for me.(I'm always flat broke). Johnny Depp carries it off remarkable well, considering the film rests almost entirely on his shoulders. It had me, constantly, either on the edge of my seat or laughing. How many films can mix those emotions? The ""No monsters up here"" part and the ""You stole my story"" line crack me up every time.The only part I thought did not work was Amy's character. I would not have thought someone like Mort would go for that bland-blonde type really. But, judging by the flash-back at the burnt house, they both seem to have been different, then something changed. I guess it was because he drank too much. The Ken Karsch character was great. Because he deals with the Shooter sort of situations every day, he was 100% calmer than Mort. He added a little bit of relaxation to an otherwise very intense film.I found Mort's reaction to young women very interesting. He would become uncomfortable, lose his train of thought and start shifting around. even when they are being friendly, flirting, even (post office worker) he was still not exactly what you would call smooth.Only after watching the making-of footage, did I realise something interesting. At the very beginning, when the camera pans in on the house, finally going through the mirror, it is meant to symbolise that we have entered Mort's world, his point of view. Then, when Amy arrives at the end, we go back out of the mirror, to her point of view. We then start to see things in a very different light. The cabin is a tip, and of course, the SHOOTER's carved all over it. I get the feeling that he had been doing the carving all the time, but since, like the psycho Mort/Shooter said, he was lying to himself. As long as he did not think it, he did not have to admit it. That is why we did not realise, we were only seeing what he wanted to see.The twist hit me like ton of bricks. At least, it would have if it had been revealed in the same old way, where the whole audience gasp. It was smarter then that. I started to suspect, then I went ""OH!"" Usually, watching a 'big twist' movie is only interesting once. This time, each time I watch it I realise something I did not see before. Especially in the scene with Ted. Like when Mort says ""I buried my dog, mister!"" Ted looks away and we assume he is feeling guilty. Actually, he is just thinking 'OK, this guys nuts'. Or something along those lines.in conclusion, a truly unique film. Johnny Depp's don't-need-words performance, and a flawless plot that can be examined lots of times, but we still won't fully understand it all. I do not think even the director understood everything that went on, some things becoming very significant by accident. A must see for any thrill and cynical humour fan.",Secret Window
296,Dolphinjoy248,Interesting and Unique...Johnny Depp plays it darn well,9,20 February 2005,"Secret Window is an intriguing little film, and it's much better than you'd expect. The plot is that a stranger turns up on Morton Rainey's doorstep accusing him of stealing his story. No, it doesn't sound that interesting, but if you give it a chance you will be both surprised and pleased. Morton Rainey played perfectly by Johnny Depp lives in a cabin in the woods since his wife left him for another man. He comes across as a nice, likable guy (if a little bitter) and you take to him immediately. The story gets underway extremely quickly when very early on in the film a mysterious stranger named Shooter appears at Rainey's door demanding he own up for stealing his story. Mort insists he has no idea what Shooter is talking about but this guy won't let it be and so persists in stalking and scaring Rainey to let him know he means business. This film really isn't that scary, but is is chilling, and John Turturro makes a very watchable and eerie villain, and his performance is convincing as a man totally out of his mind, as you wonder what he'll do next to terrorise Rainey. Johnny Depp plays a great victim, powerless to do anything about Shooter. You'll support and feel for Rainey as not only his trouble with Shooter troubling him but the fact that he has divorce and his ex wife's new lover to contend with. That's what makes Johnny Depp's performance great, you do actually care about Morton Rainey. It is a bit of a movie cliché- the hapless victim and the psychotic villain, but one thing this film is not is boring, the story draws you in and keeps you interested from start to finish, and is never slow. It's one of those films that will always be interesting and appealing no matter how many times you watch it, and this is largely down to to Depp's charm and charisma, making this extremely watchable. There's also a brilliantly-written shock towards the end which rounds off an impressive bit of film making. Very enjoyable and great performances from all involved.",Secret Window

What people may fail to realise is how layered and well thought-out this movie is. As an audience we are delving into the mind of an isolated and lonely man and in order to fully appreciate the movie you need to be taking the journey WITH Mort. If your just interested in who the guy in black with the funny accent is, i think you've probably missed the point. I love Johnny Depp's acting and i think what worked for me is Mort's apparent normality during the early stages of the movie. He never shows any signs of insanity early on...in fact all his actions tend to be what any reasonable man would do, (like getting help from detectives for instance)and i think that may have contributed to the final shock of his psychological condition towards the end.

I have never even read this book and i went to see the movie and I still thought it was awesome! It took me a while to catch on but when I did it was great. This was a great film with very good acting..just like in Pirates of the Carribean...Depp played the perfect part. I love this movie b/c it is very well written and it doesn't have sh**ty acting like a lot of other Sci-Fi/Thriller movies. Plus this movie made me jump at a lot of parts and that is another reason I like it. Is this a great movie? Yes. Is it worth watching? Definitely. I give this movie a 10/10 and hopefully that will bring it's rating up a little.,Secret Window

There are clever twists in this film that I quite enjoyed. The score by Philip Glass is very fitting and keeps the mood of the film very sombre. I especially love the cinematography as the intro credits are displayed and the gorgeous lake is shown. However, the marketing for this film was poor and instead of the mature, intelligent audience that should have seen it, we had the immature 16 year old kids expecting filth such as ""Bridget Jones' Diary"". A travesty that it did not do as well as it should have. Rent or buy it today, you'll be glad that you did!",Secret Window

Some small changes I am usually liable to understand, but in the end of the movie, as most of you people know, He kills his ex-wife Amy Rainey and her lover Ted MIlner. He succeeds and he goes even more crazy than ever. An ending I don't mind existing really, but it wasn't the original. I have read the book, rather sensational really, and the ending is TOTALLY different. The end, some guy comes out and shoots Mort Rainey right in the chest while he was trying to kill Amy. And he dies almost instantly. Ted didn't show up till later, as a matter of fact, I don't think that he was even there, I really don't remember, but I do know that he did survive and he and Amy married shortly after.They also explained better in the book about how actually John Shooter was created. I don't think that they mentioned in the movie that MOrt created Shooter out of guilt of plagiarizing.Although I still liked the movie, despite the ending. It was a movie that I was half-way satisfied with all in all. I do recommend this movie to people who haven't read the book, or they don't mind the change in the ending.-Elizabeth",Secret Window
310,hanniewigs,Excellent!,10,15 March 2004,"Spoilers! kinda of. I just wanted my fellow imdb users to know that they really need to go see ""Secret Window"", it is worth the money. Johnny Depp as always turns a character that could have been a bumbling idiot if played by someone else and turns it into a really interesting and watchable person. Johnny displays  the personality of Mort Rainey so well that you can distinguish between the three personalities pulling at Mort's psyche. The supporting cast in my opinion is slightly annoying especially Timothy Hutton as Ted Milner the man that stole Mort Rainey's wife. The most annoying and surprising disturbing thing about this thriller is John Turturro's Mississippi accent! I am from Mississippi, I know the accent, his is totally wrong, so wrong that it gets to the point that it is offending to my ears and my southern pride. But all in all this is a great movie, one that people will enjoy and one that Johnny Depp should be proud of.",Secret Window

Although Depp is a good actor, anyone who wants to see a good King movie can just click on his name on the front page and pick a movie. If you thought this movie had suspense, terror or any sort of that King magic then watch Stand by me, Green Mile, Pet Semetery, The Shining, Misery..

This movie could have been made for television by the USA network, and it could have starred some no-name actors and actresses who'd probably never be heard from again. After all, it's a Stephen King story, which is pretty much the most clichéd and corny type of story there is, regardless of which A-list actor is playing the lead. Depp's acting is just fine, but, sadly, he's armed with the standard King dialogue, which is no better than excruciatingly hokey at best. As for the plot, well, it's just so cornball and dumb that it's not even worth summarizing here. The only reason I can figure why Depp wasted his time with this film is that he must have owed King a REALLY big favor.",Secret Window

You half expect him at the end to proclaim....""Duh! Pirate!"". Nicely filmed, and it does keep you pretty much on the edge of your seat for most of the film.

Both Johnny Depp and John Turturro act quite good in this story about one of worst things that can happen to you - being mad and to not know it. Also, the director did great job making viewers like Mort Rainey who is being chased by a lunatic, cheated by wife, his blind beloved dog is killed etc. This all for the first 75 minutes makes people like Mort and fan him to solve the problem and when the truth is revealed it confuses the viewer ... oops, he is bad, but he was so sympathetic!

316,ishbelbeeson,a good movie turned disappointment,6,9 December 2006,"I will be frank and say that although this movie has some very entertaining qualities it is also a complete disappointment. Two thirds of the way through 'Secret Window' and I was really enjoying it's clever plot and the brilliant performances from Johnny Depp and John Turtorro who were both wonderful when the revealing end came and, for me, completely destroyed my outlook on the movie as a whole. The ending was an utter cliché and (although I will try not to voice an opinion too harsh on Stephen King) seemed like the 'lazy boy's' way of ending a thriller. It's been done before and really just ruined a (up until that point) sophisticated and stylish movie. It was a let down with many obvious ideas and concepts which were very hard to believe. This would be excusable if throughout the movie we had been asked as an audience to suspend our disbelief, however, for 1 hour and 15 mins 'Secret Window' and it's characters had come across as real and believable until the final plot twist. I won't criticise further by mentioning the stereo typical private investigator/security provider who (as usual to most Hollywood movies) was black, over weight, bald and fast talking...and I will suggest that you only watch 'Secret Window' if you are an avid Johnny Depp fan (post-Pirates) or if it happens to be lying around and you have nothing better to do...other then that I would not waste my time.",Secret Window

Strange things start to happen after he is visited by a man accusing him of having stolen one of his stories from him. The story itself is not bad and does keep you wondering what is going to happen next. There are a lot of surprising scenes, but unfortunately also a huge lack of depth in most of the characters. When it really comes down to it, however, it is only Johnny Depp's superb performance, which saves the film and makes it worth watching. The story itself never goes into any kind of depth to be able to have survived without the help of talented acting.

It was just rather a good entertainment for me to see a stephen king story translated well on screen, except the ending. I'm just wondering how it was possible for Mort Rainey to cover his tracks so well after killing his wife and her boyfriend. He would've had to clean up all the mess in his house with the words Shooter carved all around, get rid of the wife's car and her boyfriend's car, and bury the both of them. And did Mort have a multiple personality disorder, or was that his excuse to kill his wife? what happened to John Shooter's personality? I thought that Mort's personality had died. It might have been a bit weak, but I might've enjoyed the movie a lot more if the ending hadn't been changed from the story. what irony. the thing that matters is the ending.",Secret Window

I really did like the twist (reminds me of another movie) but I wasn't expecting it so I thought that was good.  I enjoyed the product placement of Hunter S. Thompson's Rum Diaries on the table for one of his upcoming movies lol.  I did like Johnny's character, very good acting.

Those that continue to sing the acting acclaim of someone like Johnny Depp are in my opinion either infatuated with him as the opposite sex or just simply uninformed about what ""good acting"" really looks like. Although I hadn't known ahead of time that this was from a Stephen King book, I had my interest peaked when I saw the opening credits.  It did not take long however to wonder why Stephen would let something like this movie end up bearing his name in anyway.  I assume the book was better because it would not have had the distraction of watching Johnny Depp. I had leaned over to my wife after the first visit of John Shooter and told her that I wouldn't be surprised if his character didn't really exist.  I had kept watching, waiting for the movie to get interesting, but unfortunately they must have run out of time in the movie to squeeze any of the interesting parts in. The movie was so completely predictable and borrowed from so many other good, original movies that I left thinking the producers owed money to lots of other producers of the movies they stole from. Now before anyone chalks up my comments to someone that just doesn't like Johnny Depp, you would not be COMPLETELY wrong, but I did not dislike Pirates and actually kind of liked him in Sleepy Hollow and did enjoy him in Astronauts Wife...the movie was just BLAH.  The only redeaming quality was the shooting of the scenes where he was talking to himself, seeing how far film making has come to be able to put the same person believeably in a scene is pretty neat.",Secret Window

And by scary, I mean really suspenseful. First thing first: Johnny Depp's performance is BRILLIANT. It's inspired, it's intense, and most of all, it's terrifying. He better win an Oscar!!!! I went into this movie expecting to see Johnny Depp playing his protagonist character that he usually plays, being tortured and harassed by a psychopath, played by John Turturro. Wow - I was wrong!!!!There are soooooo many surprises in this movie. Not since 'the Others' have I been so shocked by a twist in a movie. I am never using a screwdriver again - I am never driving in a jeep again, and I am NEVER eating corn again, that's for sure. Also - if you really love dogs, don't see this movie. Johnny Depp has never played a part like this one, ever. I was blown away by his performance - it's in my top three best performances of all time. The ending is super-creepy, but it really works, and it leaves you with an uneasy feeling.

The way Depp can carry a movie from frame to frame with just himself in about 90% of the frames is amazing. He is as charismatic as they come and should go down as one of the top 10 actors of all time. Simply an amazing performance, so far this years best. I didn't really care so much for Turturro's character, but it got its point across.

Here he comes with a thriller based on a Stephen King novel that is not very good but has some qualities. The best quality here is another terrific performance from Johnny Depp. No matter what he does, he succeeds in making a film entertaining even when it should not be.Depp is a writer named Mort Rainey, recently divorced because his wife (Maria Bello) cheated on him. Now he lives in a cottage near a lake, alone, writing his new book. One day a man rings his bell telling Rainey he has stolen one of his stories. Rainy is unaware of this fact and he can prove it; a magazine printed his short story a couple of years before the man, who is named John Shooter (John Turturro), claims he has written his version. Shooter wants to see this magazine before he believes it, causing quite some trouble in the meanwhile.This is a film with a secret, something we understand pretty soon. I will not reveal it, but most people will come up with an idea and find out they are right. Even though it has a secret it plays too much like a lot of thrillers we have already seen. Interesting performances (Bello is pretty good as the wive too) and some dry humor does not change that. There is one other thing I liked. Koepp payed some good attention to what David Fincher did with his 'Panic Room' screenplay, especially with the camera. There are some great shots here and together with Depp they make sure 'Secret Window' is not wasted.",Secret Window

Johnny Depp and Torturro have great chemistry on set.  The money I spent to go see this movie was well spent. Any money spent on watching Johnny Depp is money well spent.  I mean, he is the best looking actor in Holywood by far.  And not only that, he is also an incredible actor.  This movie would not have gotten very far if it weren't for Johnny Depp.  The acting was great, but I just have to say that the plot wasn't good enough for Johnny.  The ending was very unexpected, but it still was a very good ending.

The tone is threatening...The directing is quite good and fluid, the acting perfect (Turturro especially) and the atmosphere is really tense and makes anyone uneasy. The only real flaw lies in the fact that there are maybe too many clues that lead us to guess the end. And if I say that, it is because I consider myself as a good naive client for movies and surprising endings (I never guess who the killer is).warning: spoilers now:But here I did. I think we can consider this movie as a didactic one about schizophrenic character and narration. From the very beginning, clues abound: when the camera goes through the mirror, the focus on the cigarettes, both stories, the eerie atmosphere, the illogical behaviour of the main character (we keep wondering why he doesn't just show Shooter the magazine), the weird relationship with his ex-wife, the neighbour waving and Shooter answering instead of the writer, the hat, Shooter's attempt to make the writer seem guilty by using his tools... And the way of revealing the truth is not the most subtle: several Johnny Depps talking together and Shooter also...There are many movies with that kind of plot., Like ""Lost Highway"" (David Lynch), ""Fight Club"" (David Fincher), ""Identity"", ""A Tale of Two Sisters"" (Chi-Woon Kim), with a narration which follows the lies of the main character, but all those seem better done to me (smaller clues, more motivation...)

His array of work, from Edward Scissorhands to Ed Wood to Pirates of the Caribbean, strongly supports the theory that he is in the same league as Tom Hanks and Sean Penn. His performance in Secret Window further lends to this theory.Secret Window, based off a short story by Steven King, is about a writer who is confronted by a mad man claiming Depp's character stole his story and demands a certain payment for this injustice. The script is sub-par, not really holding any great mystery, but it is a sound plot with adequate suspense. The real star here is Johnny Depp. He breaths life into this character in a way no one really could with his quirky little mannerisms. Because of this, Depp really salvages what would otherwise be just an average movie and makes it intriguing. It's by no means his best work, but I'm not sure the script allowed for his best work.

The people that have slammed this movie must not have understood a lot of the symbolism. Seriously, some of it is obvious but a lot of it would require you listen to the Director's commentary to catch.While aspects of the story are predictable, you will never see the last couple minutes coming. Koepp made a film that HE believed in, with a finale that may not sit well with the general public. For this, I applaud him.As I've noted on the message board, Koepp borrowed a page from Hitchcock's book and relied on our imagination to fill in the gaps during the violent sequences. Some of it is shown but certainly not all. Without question this film tested the limits of the PG-13 rating but Koepp did not take the easy way out and turn this film into an R-rated gore fest. This film proves that PG-13 films can be gritty and poignant.Depp's performance is amazing, as can be expected. The cinematography is awesome. Watch this film with an open mind, taking to heart each character's motivations.If you've already seen the film I would strongly suggest you watch the Featurettes and listen to the Director's commentary on the DVD.

In short, it's all been done before: this film is part Scream, part Fight Club, but nowhere near as entertaining. Well, maybe it's as entertaining as Scream.

But in this movie, you have all this sympathy going towards this Mort fella (Depp) with his divorce, getting his dog killed by some nut who claims that he stole his story, and his old house getting torched, so you kind of take his side and hope things go his way by the end of the movie. So by the time the twist is revealed, instead of screaming, you more say ""Oh. My. Gosh. I've made a horrible mistake, routing for the bad-guy!"" But by then, it's too late to side with the other people, so you just go with him on it anyway, which I believe is something similar to something the director or producer of the film may have said about the movie progression at one point.

I mean I saw Hide and Seek and for those who have seen it must understand what I mean. Depp is actually in quite good performance through the movie which actually surprised me a little since a I see Depp as a limited actor in character performance but the movie gave a little hint that he actually can have some more potential and that was nice.

This movie is so predictable for a ""thriller""- for those who get the Fight Club plot twist, this takes a similar twist but delivers it so obviously throughout the film viewers shouldn't be shocked with the ""big reveal"". Shooter is so out of place and appears literally out of thin air in some scenes. This ""villain's"" portrayal is of something that feels almost nonhuman (due to his strange appearances and only seeming to show up when Depp's character is fretting about him), ruining the idea that he could have come all the way from Mississippi to torment a writer he believes stole his writing. I wanted badly to believe Shooter was real so I could feel sympathy for Depp's character, but in the back of my mind I kept thinking ""Depp's character is Shooter"". In a lot of scenes Depp's character is sleeping on the couch suggesting he dreams a lot throughout the day in isolation (this surely warps his perception of reality when he's awake?). His hatred for his wife's new lover takes a violent turn when he begins to hit the man (the audience should easily be able to connect this to how Depp's character describes Shooter as really violent). When his wife's house (jointly owned by him) burns down I knew that this was just the release of the anger Depp's character had with his wife's new lover. The acting, especially from Depp, is an 8/10 but the obvious clues that hint at the ""plot twist"" throughout the film are so in the viewer's face that a 2/10 is a perfect rating to give this very disappointing movie.",Secret Window

The movie hits right into the plot without the usual routine in too many movies - you know that its starts with happy and ends on happy in between there is some kind of monster or just afraid people. This movie lets itself be dark. As I was saying the movie its right into the plot by starting on the main character about to do the thing that will make the whole movie - confront the wife who is cheating on him. He does this. The next step is shooter turning up - many times. There are created many very creepy scenes out of Morts head. Like the one where he kills the mirror. Ultimately it ends up in this: Morts the killer. Mort is Shooter. Shooter/Mort have killed some people and now the finally comes - because was Shooter brought too Mort? Because of the cheating wife. So he kills her in the end. I think the movie looks beautiful and the acting is just great. I like the movie but without Johnny Depp and John Turturro it had been boring I think.

The lead's dog is murdered, suburban house is torched, he's man-handled, and yet he still goes back to the cabin? ALONE? And where are the cops at this point? Sure they might ignore a skewered dog, but hardcore arson? They'd be all over that small town looking for the suspect. When the lead agreed to become an accomplice to murder by disposing of bodies I'd had enough. No viewer should be expected to stick with such moronic turns. Depp seems uncertain if he should play it for chuckles or straight, probably due to the muddled character. As it is he comes off bumbling and clueless even while there are obvious signs he isn't, as if it is willful stupidity. Turturro seems to do the best he can with a clichéd character, but he has nothing on the ultimate ""Southerner at the screen-door"" from Poltergeist 2.

339,crunch_berries,A Movie for The Killer in All of Us.,6,4 January 2009,"Secret Window is a simple sort of film, I don't think it's trying to be something spectacular, just something enjoyable and with the kind of story Stephen King likes to write. The direction is neat and tidy, the acting is pretty great all around. It's got some really great moments i think where the imagination of the story is presented fantastically, particularly the parts focusing on Mort's mind. There are distinct Stephen King mind fudge moments if you know what i mean. One thing I didn't like is that its a little heavy on the foreshadowing and that was unfortunate, I didn't mind it until I realized how right I was in my predictions but you know, that's just how things go sometimes. All in all an entertaining film with a fitting length, it's nothing that'll really fill you up and it's nothing that'll drain you, it's just a little something fun.

341,Laredos,An Icy Field,4,26 May 2006,"This movie is like two great NFL football teams playing a game in January somewhere in the North. The chill factor is minus nine, the wind is gusting and swirling from thirty to forty miles an hour, the field is covered in ice and a heavy white cloud of snow is floating down. No matter how great the players might be, they cannot really play a game of football under the conditions presented to them.Similarly, the gifted players of this movie, which includes such skillful and experienced artisans as Johnny Depp, John Turturro, Maria Bello, Timothy Hutton and Len Cariou simply cannot overcome the miserable conditions presented by the script. It is contrived, predictable, inconsistent and plodding.All of the players seem to be attempting to make peace with themselves and their agents for getting them into this endeavor. Turturro, who is regularly brilliant and unique in his roles, is inexplicably cast as a mysterious being from outback Mississippi. Turturro, Brooklyn born, speaks in a hard and guttural attempt at a southern accent, completely unlike the soft and melodious tones of the outback Mississippi accent. Their gentle and lilting southern drawl, usually given with a sly smile, can be much more menacing than the bark and stern glare of Turturro.Bello, Hutton and Cariou make an effort to do something with what they have to work with, but they cannot overcome the adverse conditions. At times they provide some life and vigor to their roles, but they are finally exhausted and give spotty performances.Bello copes best with her role. She develops her character with skill and is able to create a feeling of empathy for her complex situation. She gives a good range of moods and feelings and is far and away the most realistic and three dimensional personality of the film. Hutton does not seem to ever get into his role. The physical action and expressions are there, but he seems to be elsewhere, perhaps daydreaming over a good story for his next picture.Depp seems to be making inside jokes to the audience with little quirks and gestures, conveying like a POW being forced into making a statement that the V he makes with his thumb and forefinger signifies he really doesn't mean what he is saying. His performance is good, but well beneath the capabilities of such an actor. A close watch should be kept on his hairdresser to keep this from happening to any other actor.David Koepp directed and did the screenplay. While he does a sound job as director, he too is thwarted, in a bit of irony, by his own writing. He is on the same icy field as his cast and cannot get a solid footing with his film. Cinematographer Fred Murphy does an exceptional job in capturing the natural moodiness and foreboding of the lakeside with cuts to show the contrast of city and rural life.As for as the ending, like it or not, it does not come nearly soon enough.",Secret Window

During the movie time there are several talks between Mort and Shooter,whereas mostly are on the topic of the magazine,to ask Mort show his story on the magazine.As the ending tells that Shooter's the key figure or even the key to the movie,not only mostly a ""dun"" or Mort's ""illusion indicator"" but much more he should have done.The second is that to make the movie compact while keep alluding Mort's ""real life"" experiences inconspicuously and powerfully to the ending to be revealed is really challenging,I mean it's not an easy task to only use Mort's psychology,those flash figures occasionally emerge from his mind to convey what the movie really want to convey.Sometimes audience would find it frustrated while failed to figure it out.Too allusive it is it is cheating.Although the second part of the movie sees some devices new to correct audience's consciousness stream to the right watercourse(some phone calls,still not all,between Amy or Lawyer and those words from Ted,which means it has jumped out of Mort's singleton and starts to take advantage of third person),bad performance on the first half fails it to become top-notch.Anyway,the magazine and ""story-plagiary"" is an awkward camouflage,and the potato chips make it go for wool and come home shorn.So,7 as I give.",Secret Window

Depp is really good, a little funny, the messy hair, the sleeping moments and specially the dreams are great. The scenes are very good filmed. I like the lights, the colors, the sounds.

Johnny Depp's character Mort is terrific as he lightens the ""suspense"" of the movie and creates moments of laughter.  John Turturo is fabulous but his character becomes stale as the movie wears on.The most unfortunate part of this movie is that the suspense just didn't seem to be there for me.  The story was interesting and had potential to be riveting if done correctly, yet it was not.  Predicable and slow, the movie wore on and did not seem reminiscent of Stephen King literature... which may explain why this was a novella and not a novel.In my humble opinion, this is a great rental movie, not worth paying $14 to see; Johhny Depp's role is enjoyable, but not justified for that kind of money.",Secret Window

The movie is impressive for the bulk of the movie, but then it instantly dumps itself with the third act twist. This is not the filmmaker's fault by any means, it is purely Stephen King's.

I didn't even know that it was a Stephen King adaptation until the opening credits rolled.*** This probably contains spoilers ***Let me start with the good:  Excellent acting by Depp and Turturro (and others), as usual.  Some of the camera shots/sequences were really creative (like trip through the 'secret window' during the title sequence).  There were some intentionally humorous parts as well and the whole 'hair' theme worked well.Now for the not-so-good:  Like some other people have posted, the suspense kind of died out as the movie progressed.  In fact, except for a few quick scares, it never really got moving.  However, what I disliked the most about the film was the incredibly fast plot transition in the end.  Subtle (and not-so-subtle) clues were dropped throughout, however, we never really see a believable character transition.  Other than the fact that he slept a lot and began to develop a tick in his jaw (funny, by the way), Mort really didn't seem all that disturbed given everything that was going on in his life.  This is the meat of the story and should have been the film's primary focus.Overall, this movie would make a good rental. If you don't mind paying for tickets, it's probably not a bad night out at the theater either  (I think it's worth a watch for Depps performance alone).  But expect to see a movie that could have been much more.Oh, one thing for the trivia buffs.  Many times throughout the film we see on the coffee table is a book authored by Hunter S.

This was a psycho-thriller that I wanted to be scarier and wasn't. Although it was a good movie, it's not great. I saw to many scenes were I was asking myself 'isn't that a so and so movie reference.' Mort's ill-placed humor was the weight of the movie. His appearance, little side remarks, gestures plus facial expressions are what kept the flow as all else was just that, all else. His funniest line, to me, was when Amy was leaving their house and he comes out behind her... PRICELESS!It just didn't have me on the edge of the seat at all. Shooter was as frightening as gum stuck on my shoe bottoms. I was MORT-ified (horrified, no pun intended) when Amy closed the door and Rainey was behind it.

I haven't read the story by S.King but I sure feel compelled to now that I saw the movie. Let me say this: the movie might have some deficiencies and one or two little annoying things about the characters, but otherwise it was absolute pleasure to watch it. Because of the cinematography (the long moving shots of the beautiful house and the elaborate showcase of the writers den atmosphere), because of the story and the way it was told and directed, because the movie has an undoubtedly classic twist, but it really comes out of the blue until the last 20-30 min when skillfully we are being given some mild hints about what might actually be happening. But yet again, because the character of Mort was so elaborately constructed as the victim of both a crazy Mississippi guy who thinks his story got stolen, as well as a victim of his bitchy, cheating wife and her sleazy new boyfriend...it is so surprising to see how it all unfolds. I mean sure, as I already said the story is not THAT unique and original and the idea exist in other movies and books, but the merits of this movie are more in the atmosphere it creates. I don't know, but I just loved it! It had this cozy mysterious feeling to it and a deeply uncozy ending, which to some extend left a bitter taste in my mouth, not because it wasn't good, but because I didn't want it to be this way for Mort, because the movie made me feel for him and like him.

I know how hard it is to write but I also know how easy it is to decide that I don't like how it is going so I will change it and just leave it as is without any segway.

The thing is, I figured the plot out quite soon, staying a step ahead every time. The film just wasn't fast enough.

I was on the edge of my seat from the time the windshield wiper noise started before the movie had even started.  Is that not intense? I'll admit I don't usually see scary movies.  Whoever thought Once Upon a Time in Mexico was better than Secret Window has got to be sick.  I've never seen so much blood and gore and senseless killing in my life.What I liked about Secret Window was the funny parts = ""I'd be lying if I didn't say I was on the verge of doing Snoopy dances"" and ""I'm in trouble"". Too funny for words.I also enjoy seeing parts of other movies from Johnny's past.  Watch him walk around with the paddle = ""you're supposed to be dead - am I not?"" and when he picks up the fireplace poker = ""who makes all these? - I do and I practice with them three hours a day""   and when he falls over the cliff (off the sofa) into the ocean.

It is not fair that some men admit they don't like Johnny Depp, acting because he is handsome. Give the man his honor and his due while he lives. He is a great actor. He absorbs himself in his acting. He is unmatched. He reminds me of Charleston Heston. Most actors act by screaming at you. Most actors act by using a lot of props. Johnny Depp needs neither. Johnny Depp can whisper through an entire scene. Keep your attention. He is that good. Johnny and John made Secret Window worth seeing over and over. The second time is better than the first time.

The story is not old, because Johnny Depp brought it to the fore in a new and fresh dimension.  Every story can be old if you want to think of it that way.  All stories have something in common with other stories, especially thrillers like this one. Johnny Depp has taken this character and brought him alive in a unique way from other stories in this genre.There may not be as many people who have it all figured out in the first 20 minutes as some of you out there might think. I feel bad for the people who are so sophisticated they can't let themselves fall into a plot; instead, they sit there thinking, 'gee, this is just like that film, or King's other story, or...'  No matter what similarities there might be in Secret Window, and I am an avid Stephen King reader and didn't feel slighted in the least, Johnny Depp's superb handling of his character makes it all fresh and new.One person complained that Depp was not likable as the slothful, badly dressed,unkempt-haired writer.  I disagree.  That is what makes him all the more sympathetic.  In other scenes, you can see that he is a very intelligent, grief-stricken man who is trying to put his life back together when everything is against him.  The superb 'twist' that many of you felt didn't exist was revealed in inches throughout the film. What lies under the surface is what makes this film a winner and Depp reveals it piece by piece in a superbly controlled manner.I cannot be more specific and not spoil the plot for those who haven't seen the movie yet.

Both are totally watchable.Tight, concise writing packs a lot of history into otherwise thin dialogue; a good example is the subplot involving the divorce proceedings between Depp's character and his wife. The mutual failings which lead to their breakup are never made explicit, but suggested with a few quick brushstrokes of dialogue here and there.Based on a short story by Stephen King--a writer fascinated with the act of writing--this movie plays with notions of creativity, authorship and identity. Though hardly a profound film, it does add a layer to an otherwise thin story.The actual ""plot"" is weak and the film loses marks for being a whodunit that drops enough hints to reveal not only *who*dunit but howdunit, whydunit and wheredunit... all in the first act.If you're a fan of Johnny Depp and/or Stephen King, this is definitely worth your time and the price of a rental.

368,Fennell,The First Opening scene kinda spoiled the entire movie.,7,12 August 2004,"""Secret Window"" was alright in my book, Depp's performance and personality kinda reminded me of me. I guess that's why I liked it so much. The movie was kinda spoiled at the beginning when he had a second voice talking back to him in the car, and then he went into the room and flipped out in pchycotic sort of way. That short scene ""killed"" the long movie following it. Turturo's performance was excellent, but it was way different and kind of off base from the Adam Sandler movies and Fink that he played in. I never quite understood how everyone in the town new of what Depp did with his wife, her fiancé, and the two guys in the jeep. Oh well, I still liked it, in a personal way. I rate this film a ""one eye open"".",Secret Window
369,PearlDancer08,Great Acting,5,10 January 2005,"Thrillars aren't usually my style, but I hired 'Secret Window' out because it starred Jonney Depp, who adds special touches to all of his characters, and I thought it would be interesting. Coming from someone who doesn't actually watch thrillers all that much, I would have to say that it was a pretty tame one. I thought it would have more suspense than it did, especially as it was written around a Stephen King novel, but it didn't strike me as an extremely good thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. All of the effects they used to make it eerie were just the usual ones that have been used over and over again, so this made it predictable.However, it is a must for Jonney Depp fans trying to convince others of his talent. His skill at acting really shows in this movie, and several of the other cast turned out quite brilliant performances themselves, but nothing compared to Jonney's ability to entertain us. Also, it was a well written movie, even if the plot line is a bit sick at times, but then I guess, you have to expect that, being a Stephen King story.All in all, the movie is neither good nor bad, it just depends on what you are expecting. If you are expecting action and suspense, you could be a bit disappointed, but if you are there to watch actors show their talent, you will no doubt be impressed, just as I was.",Secret Window

If you are a Johnny Depp fan, i believe that you'd find his acting very good, i for one, thought he acted his character out excellently, but, to see him in such a disappointing film was rather shocking. Seeing that it was based on a Stephen King novel, i thought that it would be a great film, but i think that it would be better to read the book. If you read it, which i have, it turns out to be a lot more scary, and not as spoiling.Overall, i believe the film was an okay film, as the acting was great, and the story wasn't bad, but it could of been made less blatant about what was going to happen, and more scary. Some people may have found it scary, but if you could tell what was going to happen in the film, you'd find it less brilliant.So i would say, if you get scared easy, this could be a thriller for you, but if you look for real thrills, i'd read the novel, but if you don't like reading, i'd give this film a miss.Sorry Johnny, sorry Steven!7/10.Sqeeky -x-",Secret Window

Calm down, throw it into the player, and get scared and amazed... Offcourse, like almost every other movies around there are a few downsides. For one, its too short!? ( you'll understand) It also contains one or two actors thats not really ""into it."" But it doesn't matter all that much in this movie.

374,shadowblade78,Deliciously dark and satisfying,8,23 July 2006,"***May contain VERY minor spoilers, but NO plot-breaking details.*** I was pleasantly surprised by Secret Window. I remember when I first started seeing commercials and such for it. I thought to myself ""Another stupid thriller for people with an IQ of 50"", and never gave it a second thought.I'm glad to say that I was wrong about it. I'm not a Johnny Depp fan, but I also don't specifically avoid his movies. With some time to kill, and not much on TV, I flipped it on. Thank all that matters, it's NOT just another pathetic teen angst ridden excuse for a movie. It was actually GOOD. A solid horror flick from start to end.Johnny Depp may have the starring role as Mort Rainey, but the true performance in this one is delivered by John Turturro, as the sinister and intimidating John Shooter, a southerner with an ice cold glare, a calm demeanor and yet a hot temper, and a iron-clad vengeance. His performance can best be described as perfect.Mort Rainey, writer, is working on another story. His recent divorce weighing heavily on him. One day, a man shows up accusing him of stealing his story. A southerner by the name of John Shooter. Shooter isn't prepared to get the run-around. He forces Rainey to deal with the situation, though he won't make it easy for him. The story progresses as Rainey scrambles to meet Shooters demands, seeking help from local law enforcement, and having to cope with his stalkers evil antics.I've seen a lot of movies, and more times than not, it's fairly obvious what's going to happen, but I honestly did not see this one coming. The finale was very satisfying, given that most movies anywhere near this genre are a rehash of the same white horse nonsense. It brought a smile to my face, and that's not an easy thing to do.A final note. Special effects were minimum. Secret Window didn't rely on a lot of shiny things and loud noises to try to appease todays less than intelligent and less than credible movie viewer. No big booms. No bloodbaths. No brain-eating zombies without a bottom jaw. Pretty much the whole way through, it was about the story.Cheers for Secret Window. It has restored a little of my faith in movies.",Secret Window

Secret Window is a brilliantly crafted psychological thriller that keeps its secrets through well-placed misdirection and suspense that both engages the audience and brings them into the story. One day a mysterious stranger named John Shooter shows up on the doorstep of novelist Mort Rainey, accusing him of stealing his script and demanding reparations. The directing is exceptional, through the eye of director David Koepp we get inside of the mind of Mort Rainey, hear his thoughts, and see through his eyes; while all the while providing hints ever so subtlety about who John Shooter is, Mort's shadowy past, and the origin of the Secret Window. Johnny Depp, John Turturro, and Maria Bello lead the cast and give excellent performances. A smart and engrossing mystery, Secret Window is a masterpiece of suspense and terror that's among the best of Stephen King's adapted works.",Secret Window

Some scenes are kinda scary and I jumped 2 feet in the air but all in all, it's suitable even for younger audience.The plot is kind of slow but steady and doesn't leave you confused, dropping no hints to what is true or false.

One more notice is needed, when Depp is called for inquiry on the fire burned, where he says about a bottle which was used for firing, 'so, it worked for something'. Then you realize the psychological come-and-goes. He pushes himself to convincing himself to punish her wife in an exactly the same way as he wrote in his past story. Depp is brilliantly acting.

Many reviews, make the claims that this movie is ""outworn"", ""cliched"" and even ""predictable""! With these claims, I strongly disagree. The writing for this film is incredibly clever and complicated, I myself had to watch the film 2 or 3 times before I could fully comprehend all of the twists and turns that are interwoven throughout. Not a film for the faint hearted - although the majority of the violence is only implied - there are a few gory scenes, which all include a screw driver and a lot of blood. Despite how this may sound, this is not a ""full on gore movie"" by any means. Quite the opposite, it is a very deep psychological thriller which will leave you with a lot to think about. A truly moving performance by Johnny Depp, who plays the role of Mort outstandingly, so that you can really connect with Mort, and empathize with how he is feeling. John Turturro, another incredible actor, plays Shooter with a real eeriness,with the perfect amount of emotion and madness. A truly fantastic film, which will leave you jaw dropped (no exaggeration) by the time you reach the end. Plus Johnny Depp is gorgeous as Mort Rainey, and that can't be bad ;)",Secret Window
379,davj86,One of the worst films I've seen recently,3,21 November 2005,"I was not impressed with this film at all. Firstly, I don't rate Depp highly as an actor. His expressions and moods consist of the ""look at me I'm crazy"" wide-eyes of Jack Sparrow, or the furrowed-brow-and-tired-eyes-of-a-troubled-mind look, used in this film amongst many others. Poor acting aside I wasn't impressed by the plot or scripting. I haven't read the original novel so I cannot tell if this is due to poor screenplay writing or simply the quality of the story. Either way, I felt that the dialogue was dull and lacked any sort of character from any of the parts, including the horribly clichéd deep south warbling of Shooter. As for the spectacular twist in the tale, well, I personally was able to see it coming as soon as Depp claims to have bruises on his arms to prove Shooter's existence. I guess most people who read this will do so because they like the film, so I don't expect anyone who reads this to agree with me. My opinion however remains unchanged.",Secret Window

Then when I see who was creating the 'Shoother' character that I thought that heck its the wife's fault as this would never happened if she hadn't cheated on him.

Really.The Stephen King's ""Secret Window, Secret Garden"" adaptation wasn't the best and only such an explanation would justify it. Having Mort imagining that there actually was someone threatening him seems far more believable than this twist at the end, only because of the bad script.

Most people seem to believe that Mort is simply just another mental patient this however isn't the case, not even close. Mort was a writer and as a writer he created a character, one that would be able to do what he didn't have the courage to do, kill Amy, the woman who broke his heart.

I figured this movie out when Mort Rainey was standing out by the lake with good ol' Shooter. When Shooter walked away from him is where the whole story clicked. I am not a good one to figure out movies, I was one of the shocked ones at the end of The Sixth Sense, but this movie was definitely a thinker, a true mind puzzle. Johnny Depp is a wonderfully talented versatile actor who has proved himself over and again with an array of excellent movies.

I honestly believe Stephen King has hit a dead end in his writing career because if this is any indication of what is to come, the next movie is going to be a remake of IT but instead of a clown its going to be a magician or a mime or some sort of entertainer that appeals to children. This movie was just like the Shining except instead of terrorizing his wife and son, he terrorizes himself, his ex-wife and her husband, and instead of those he terrorizes escaping and him dying, they die and he lives.

391,mskohleradv,not too shabby,6,15 November 2021,"Secret Window is a psychological thriller that hides its deep secrets through brilliantly crafted mystery and suspense. With the help of an amazing cast, Johnny Depp, John Turturro, Maria Bello, and many others, a thrilling and captivating film is created. It is based on Stephen King's book, Secret Window, Secret Garden, which couldn't have been easy to direct, but director David Koepp did a phenomenal job of bringing this story to life, and to the eyes of many impressed viewers.Writer Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp), in the middle of a messy divorce with his wife Amy (Maria Bello), has relocated himself to his secluded cabin striving to recover his mental health in solitude. However his isolation is abruptly disrupted when a psychotic farmer named John Shooter finds him, accusing Rainey of plagiarizing his work. Rainey overlooks the allegations at first because he knows that Shooter is wrong, but Shooter has every intention to pester and threaten Rainey until he gets what he wants. In Shooter's hunt for vengeance, threats lead to extreme measures -- even murder. Rainey has to try to protect himself, his work, and his sanity. Circumstances go from bad to worse and secrets are revealed and everything becomes more horrifying and complicated.The cast in Secret Window is excellent. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Rainey and John Turturro's portrayal of Shooter compliment each other perfectly, creating the ideal conflict for this kind of film. The considerable amount of hatred that Rainey and Shooter share toward each other is expressed phenomenally through the unmatched talent and experience of Johnny Depp and John Turturro. Johnny Depp continues to impress by truly becoming his character on set. Whether it is a facial expression or the way he walks, he is completely invested in every aspect of the character. Character portrayal and acting can make or break a movie. There is nothing worse than sitting through a movie with bad acting or characters. Good thing Johnny Depp never disappoints.Music is something that makes all the difference in a movie, especially thrillers. As a musician, music is something I am always paying attention to when watching a movie. Geoff Zanelli, James Newton Howard, and Philip Glass created a captivating soundtrack that is intense at precisely the right moments. Music is key when expressing emotions of the characters, creating suspense and intensity of the story, and scares, of course, that make everyone jump out of their seats. All of which are present in this film. The soundtrack literally got my heart racing. It is mind blowing how music can control human emotions in that way.The plot in Secret Window is creative and well thought out. Towards the end of the movie when all the deep secrets are revealed I was mystified. However, it is predictable if you are paying attention. Despite the great storyline, I am not completely satisfied with the ending. The ending feels rushed and incomplete. This movie does not have the classic ""everything gets resolved"" and ""good guys win"" ending. I was disturbed by the ending because it is not an outcome that I am accustomed to. I was confused after it ended and wanted to know what happened next because it was not clearly resolved.This film deals with real world problems and puts it into a terrifying perspective. Despite the incomplete ending, Secret Window is a thrilling story with an amazing psychological plot twist that will have you on the edge of your seat. I would recommend this movie to anyone that is looking for a good, intense, storyline. This movie emphasizes the effects that our mental health has on our lives on an eerie level.",Secret Window

Tonight, it was on cable and sadly I missed the first half hour or so. Yes, I was disappointed but the part I really wanted to see over and over again was the ending. I'm not a sadist but Depp played those scenes so coolly chilling that I always remember at that point in the cinema, not a sound was heard. I think everyone, like me was temporarily paralysed for those few moments, for the sheer.....sorry, you all have to see this movie.Let me just say that I am unable to talk about things like depth of character or commitment to role etc etc simply because I don't know much about the science of acting/film-making. What I do know however is knowing on a visceral level what is good acting from weak/fake and what is a good movie by the way it moves you.This movie does that for me.

393,colleenbeen592,Favorite Movie Ever!,10,23 February 2008,"This movie is number one in my heart. I have always been a Johnny Depp fanatic and after seeing this movie my love grew stronger. Johnny Depp and Stephen King should work together more often because the subtle clues and foreshadowing in this movie are superb. One of my favorite symbols in the movie is the mirror, if you didn't notice in the being of the movie the camera zooms into the mirror (making everything backwards) I believe this is to show how Mort Rainey is seeing the word and how everything is in order. However, near the end of the movie when Mort's wife is coming to his house with the divorce papers the camera backs out of the mirror (going back into reality) where the house was a mess and garbage was strewn everywhere. I think that this was the perfect symbol in the movie because it is so easily over looked however, it explains the whole movie. I've been reading the reviews of this movie on this site and I can understand how some people don't enjoy this movie or think that it is well made. However, it is just disappointing to read a review where the author is trashing the movie when they don't even know what they were talking about. I am referring to a review I read earlier that said (roughly quoting) ""and then his wife's car pulls up and the house is all of the sudden a mess with the word shooter written everywhere.""

Johnny Depp's character Rainy, is a nervous and stress filled writer who is going through the process of a divorce. Johnny Depp does a good job portraying his character. This film has excellent cinematography, and it has a lot of symbolism worked into it. It works around all the gory and sexual scenes to make it PG-13 while still conveying the right effect. Overall I think this movie is such a good movie. Some parts are predictable but the last couple minutes reveal an unexpected twist. The movie keeps you interested in the characters through everything they do. I think this film works, for me I was interested through the whole movie, but this is a movie you either love or hate.

But instead I stayed. The majority of the movie builds suspense and curiosity; even though the flashbacks are awkward. But the end was abrupt, pointlessly gruesome and without any resolution. The denouement seems like they cut out a crucial scene so it takes a minute to understand part of the very end. Ultimately, I would not recommend this film. It was not what I expected; especially with the excellent job of picking scripts Depp has done in the past. From the middle of the film through to the end seemed like the screenwriter/original author had gotten in way over their heads and had no bright ideas of how to finish the story. In ended up like a cheap horror movie. But the initial character building and 'effects' just before you find out who-dun-it are interesting and pretty well done.",Secret Window

The problem is that the storyline doesn't work. This film seems to be a combination of ""The Shining"" and ""Misery"" but it isn't nearly as enthralling as those two. Also, the introduction of the schizophrenic alter ego is becoming a bit threadbare. That theme has been explored enough in films like ""Psycho"" or ""Fight Club"" etc. An additional problem is the characters. No one of those seems to be able to inspire a bit of sympathy.

They are quite similar, 90% of the time in the movie take place in the main character's head, you don't know it until the last 20 minutes.",Secret Window
399,tapio-nuutinen,Johnny Depp saves a lot,8,1 June 2004,"This movie is somewhat better than your average King film.Of course it has its flaws. It gets a bit repetitive on the chapters where Shooter pays him a visit. The movie lacks depth bad time, and the characters are way too thin to be interesting, except for the Depp's Mort Rainey.On the good side, Johnny Depp really saves a lot. I don't think I would have enjoyed this film this much didn't it have Depp starring. Possible SPOILER: Most of the viewers are also likely to get to say ""told you so"" when the plot gets revealed at the end.But it's still better than your average Stephen King movie, and as such a refreshing one.",Secret Window

I am no teeny-bopper but a 45 year old housewife who first saw Johnny on 21 Jump Street twenty years ago. I have been following his career ever since. I love the way that Johnny has taken his movie career by the horn and has passed over mainstream roles for the more quirky ones. Well, again I wasn't disappointed. ""Secret Window"" was a suspenseful story in the true tradition of Steven King's writing. The story has everything... beautiful scenery, strong characters, mystery, a bit if gore, comic relief and a great plot twist. I must admit, I did think the ending was kinda ""Corny""! Take a look, it is a fabulous 2 hr escape! The groovy one has spoken!",Secret Window
401,xylochick02,Depp proves his talent once again,7,12 March 2004,"This movie wouldn't be half as good as it is without Johnny Depp.  It's a solid enough story, but if you know anything about Stephen King the plot twist and the end won't surprise you much.  The end especially is a bit choppy at times, and character development (besides Depp's, that is) is scarce; but Depp's considerable talent pushes this movie to exceed its aspirations.  He smirks, and mutters, and right from the opening scenes you realize that more than just a leading man, Depp IS the movie.  He is what makes the movie enjoyable--and, ultimately, saves it from just being ""okay,"" instead turning it into something that's worth seeing.  On the whole, this movie's a good choice if you like to be a little scared, or if you're just in the mood for something different.  (Keep in mind when you go to see this that this movie is rated PG-13, so you'll probably want the younger ones to stay home.)",Secret Window
402,ejdrake,Misery meets fight club,3,12 March 2004,"This film wasn't bad. Considering the audience was a light-hearted group quick to laugh at the wry moments, I may not have gotten the full effect. The film from start to finish had a aspects of Misery and Fight Club mixed in. The explanation of the plot towards the end was opened to the audience way, way too easily not causing any speculation and the suspense itself was lacking. There were clues, do not get me wrong. Yet it did not grab me as ""The Sixth Sense"" did, leaving me questioning the end and trying to analyze anything I could grasp as a potential clue. Everything in ""The Secret Window"" was just too...well, too well explained. Depp seemed to handle his role well enough, but the repetition of his need for sleep became tiring and obvious from the very beginning. Something about the timing of the suspenseful moments left the film without actual suspense. Once I saw what the character ""Shooter"" was capable of, I usually knew what was to occur in terms of suspense.The ending itself was very ""Misery,"" the book, not the movie. The plight of the main character left me with an urge to see ""Fight Club"" again. Perhaps fight club just has undertones of ""The Secret Window."" Who knows. Despite my general unhappiness with the film itself, I was pleased with the ending. Very Stephen King. Much more true to the work than the film adaptation of ""Misery"", at least, at a novice glance.",Secret Window
403,naccha,Cool and creepy thriller,10,24 March 2004,"Marvelous acting by the two Johns (Depp and Turturro).  The middle of the movie could have really lagged if it were not for Johnny Depp.  He was fascinating to watch as he portrayed a man on the edge who was losing his touch with reality.... Turturro was really creepy and played his part with a lack of emotion that really made the character extremely chilling. Stephen King's novella, as all his writings are, provides the twist in the ending that really startled me.  I was transfixed to my seat even in the middle of the movie, I had to stay put to see what was going to happen next, because it wasn't blatantly evident and it totally kept you guessing.  I definitely would recommend this movie for not just the consummate Johnny Depp fan (which I am) but to anyone who loves a good story with an explosive ending.

405,kimmiebech2005,Depp adds a certain spark.,10,13 March 2004,"Johnny Depp has done it again. He has managed to once again carry an okay movie up a notch to being... well... enjoyable. He is perfectly casted as Mort Rainey, a mentally disturbed writer with writer's block who has secluded himself in a cabin in the woods. His nervous tics and sometimes comical gestures help to enhance a weakening story line.
However, watching this, you can't help but think ""I've seen this before."" Although it has that familiarity factor, it's still watchable and utterly enjoyable. It is a typical Steven King adaptation about a man who has been betrayed by his wife and is mentally scarred after witnessing the two in bed together. I won't give away the ending, but about 3/4 of the way through, it becomes apparent, although when it comes out, it is revealed in a way that still has a bit of the ""wow"" factor.",Secret Window

It was different, surprising, and original, I'll give you that, but i still over all was disappointed, especially due to the hype and the fact that I really like Johnny Depp as an actor. He does a great job of playing his character, and his antagonist really helps to create the edge of your seat suspense that keeps you hooked throughout the movie. This movie is one of those you just have to see for yourself, no matter what you've heard from others, to make your own decision.

I knew it would be good since I'm a big King and Depp fan, but this movie went beyond my expectations. I do not, however, recomend this film to someone that just wants to be scared or actually enjoys teen slasher films. This is for someone that wants to think and loves great film making. In my opinion this is the best ""King film"" since the original Shinning. The only complaint I had for the movie was the obvious Doritoes and Mountain Dew adds (always label out!) But really that is a stupid small matter. Again, if you like exciting, suspensful, thinkers with a few chills thrown in, you will love this movie, if for nothing else, go to see it for Johnny Depp's hair...crazy!

408,breakfastmonster,Amusing for Depp fans; overall a bit dry.,7,13 March 2004,"Being a fan of Johnny Depp, i'd see his films just to enjoy his work. Here again he's very good, but I had a hard time figuring out *why* he took the role, until the end. Most of the film is not as scary as i'd hoped, but then most of King's works don't frighten me all that much at all, and I prefer things like Shawshank Redemption anyhow.Johnny seems to have a fairly comfortable role here, and I mean that in the physical sense: slouching around in an old robe and eating doritos on that kind of paycheck sounds like fun to me. They needed a stylist for that hair? ^_^Meanwhile, he plays the role convincingly and shows why he's one of the better actors working today. He manages to keep us interested even during some of the slower parts, allowing us to watch his character interact with himself in the endearing and somewhat wacky way that lonely creative types develop. Those were my favorite parts of the film, I think, and I enjoyed the movie just for that.If you want to see a scary movie but can't take REALLY scary stuff, go check it out. If you like Johnny, definitely see it. Otherwise, use your instincts. PS: If you do see it, stay for the end of the credits. There's a very amusing little treat.",Secret Window

He did an awesome job in Pirates of the Caribbean The Curse of the Black Pearl and in Once Upon a Time in Mexico.

Then one day a man by the name of Shooter comes and knocks on Mort's door accusing Mort of copying one of his stories. Mort tries to show Shooter an original copy but Mort can't seem to find even a single original copy. Mort can't seem to find an original copy in the time limit set by Shooter. Strange and wierd things start happening in Morts cabin and soon Mort tries to find out who Shooter really is, before it's too late. Stephen King, the master of terror, brings us this exceptionally well-written thriller. David Koepp, the writer of Panic Room, directs this spine-tingling thriller. Along with an acclaimed cast, which includes Johnny Depp (Sleppy Hollow), Maria Bello (The Cooler), Charles S. Dutton (Gothika), and John Turturro (Miller's Crossing), who do their very best, Secret Window is a well directed, well written, and well acted psychological thriller.",Secret Window
410,breeland-bc,Great psychological thriller,7,15 March 2004,"I really enjoyed this movie. Of course, I had already read the novella, so I knew the story was more psychological than supernatural.  I think the film (script, actors, director) did an excellent job of telling a story that takes place almost entirely inside a man's head.  The Stephen King version was one of the most compelling renderings of the pain of divorce - for man or woman - that I've read anywhere.  In the film, you couldn't miss how much even thinking about Amy and Ted was shredding Mort's heart. Unfortunately, the trailer gave a lot of people false expectations.  If you were expecting horror or a lot of action (like my husband), you were unavoidably disappointed.  This is too bad because, for what it is, this film is an excellent piece of work.",Secret Window

Hutton was good too, as was Dutton for their small parts.  I would have liked to see someone else in Maria Bello's role although she was adequate.Depp's characterization of Mort is brilliant and carries this nearly one man performance.  Even in this thriller he adds snippets of comic relief and carries this nearly one man show.  As is often the case, Depp takes a good movie and makes it great.  I would have liked to see more of Turturro though.Although there are one or two weaker spots, this is one of the best adaptations of Stephen King that I've seen.  I thought I had it figured out, but I did not see the end coming (don't want to spoil it).  My mother loved it.  I think I'll see if my kids want to see it.

412,mellygator-284-361949,Wrong Rating,7,5 February 2012,The movie is OK - very typically Stephen King stuff. Johnny is very Johnny as you'd expect. But what i'm truly horrified about is the rating this has been given. We sat down to watch this with our nearly 13 year old and our 10 year old thinking that the rating would make this a fairly tame movie but after just a few minutes we decided we would have to watch this by ourselves before deciding whether the kids would get to watch it. We are not especially prudish parents but I really felt that the level of violence and scariness was far to high to be a 12 or even 12A. I checked other King movies out and can't find any others below a 15. I can not understand why this should be view-able to youngsters. Even Shawshank Redemtion was a 15 and Green Mile is 18!!!,Secret Window

The ""ironic twist"" of an ending is broadcast loud and clear many, many times throughout the film, the first time only about a half hour into it.  Even if one somehow doesn't pick up on these clues, we've seen this exact twist so many times in recent mediocre thrillers, that it is almost to be expected, therefore ruining any element of surprise, and in this case making the ending down right hilarious.All in all, it feels like a late night B-grade Showtime movie without the action and nudity.  Depp and Turturro are the only redeeming value, but their performances alone are not enough to justify any amount of time or money spent on watching this movie.",Secret Window

Johnny Depp has created another great character in ""Mort Rainey"" (and as with a lot of other movies he stars in, I don't believe that someone else could have made it as special).  Since I am a huge Depp fan, the thing I enjoyed most about this movie was not having to sit through numerous scenes where he was not present.  He's on the screen for almost the entire movie.

The movie was good, but it lacked something.  I think it would have been better if they had decided to do either a suspense movie OR a scary movie, because it wasn't all the way one or the other. To keep from telling what happens, I will just simply say that I did not like how they portrayed Johnny Depp's character.  I thought he said he was looking for movies that his children could watch and be proud of?  Well, that definitely wasn't one of them. I also thought the ending was a horrible way to end it, but maybe that's just me.  Johnny Depp is my favorite actor and I would have liked if he had come out the hero. The movie had humorous parts, but what movie with Johnny Depp doesn't have a little humor?  I thought he brought a lot to the movie.

From the camera angles, to the detailed (and engaging) discourse, to the sound and editing ""The Secret Window"" deserves recognition this review couldn't begin to honor (and keeps you on the edge of your seat!). Instead of going into a detailed plot summary of the movie, I suggest you go see it for yourself.

I mean, in Pirates he did a fantastic job, and I think it can be because the fantastic writing. It gave him nice little quips that made him... real. For a pirate in our minds, anyway. Benny and Joon, Edward Scissorhands.. they all give him what he needs, time and character. Not to say he didnt develop one. Sometimes it's just not written in. Small parts are always the hardest. He did make this guy seem pretty real. But it got a little weird later... once you know, all of the sanity drew down to a clean 0. He still had his trademark... uh... gestures. (which i love.) Sometimes I wish he had a few more quips. Or not even that.. but tendencies. Besides the whole... napping and picking up the phone before answering (which bothered me..)But you know... meh.

It seems like the typical stephen king book(novella,if your picky) to me, murder, freak accidents, and crazy mind stuff.

He actually makes it seem like he is really insane.  I loved the fact that I was actually confused at first which is very strange because I am a very big horror movie fanatic.

I thought it was funny and even though I guessed the ending of the film half way through (which really wrecked it for me) it was entertaining, and definitely a buyer only because Johnny did so well.  Trying not to be too critical here, I think the movie could have been a little less obvious in how it brought around the twist.  Stating the obvious can kind of wreck the dramatic tension, and in this movie it did just that.  Personally I like the cryptic writing in movies, particularly if the main character is insane.

I understand the movie now that I got a few things cleared up (the reason Mort went insane or skitzo., the reason that the wine bottle led to Mort when his and Amy's house was burned down... things like that)and I'm not happy one bit that they completely changed the story of the movie. The only things they really didn't change were the characters, the name of the story, and a few things that happened between the characters. The ending was changed and the reason he went insane was changed. His wife never caused it. He drove himself insane because in fact Mort did steal the story Secret Window, Secret Garden. He stole it from another student (John Kinter) in one of his college classes, submitted it to a publisher (since they wouldn't publish one of his own), and was always afraid that someone would call and accuse him of stealing their story. He eventually forgot about this, but somewhere in his head he still remembered and Mort drove himself insane. The Story was originally called Crowfoot Mile, but Mort changed it so he could get it published. In chapters 41 and 42 it tells exactly what Mort had done and on page 378 in the epilogue it says,' ""You don't think he created John Shooter just to punish you, do you?"" Evans asked. ""No. Shooter was there to punish Mort. I think... ""She paused and... ""I think that Mort stole somebody's work sometime in the past,"" she said.' Now don't get me wrong I really loved the movie but I wish that they could have just left the plot of the story the same you know. Johnny Depp really did a good job too. I really wish that all of you whoever watched this movie and have not read the book will consider it because you're missing a lot. The book is better than the movie and it's easier to understand too.

The story really revolves around his character, Morton Rainey, an author who has recently lost his writing momentum since coming through a divorce.I felt, however, the character Morton meets later in the film (John Shooter) had very little to do in the film, and he seemed like a great character that the audience would have liked to see more of.I was really drawn into the film from the start but was slightly disappointed about the ending, which is ironic due to the film's main message that the ending of any story is the most important aspect.I would encourage any fan of Stephen King or Johnny Depp to see this film but it's not as exciting as the trailer shows it to be, although it's very compelling and heart-warmingly funny in places.Overall rating:  4/5",Secret Window
432,Depped,Big movie,10,22 May 2004,"I think that this was one of Depp's best movies. It was very unpredictable, If it was just another movie like all the other's it would be boring let alone predictable. Johnny makes all his movies interesting. If my vote counted for anything i would totally vote Johnny best actor. Of course he was voted that before. Anyway, this movies is a good suspense. I highly recommend it. Not for children though. I may be a kid but i know a good movie when i see one. It had a unusual twist at the end, and it was not as any other movie i'v seen before,i hope he has remarkable movies. Like this one in the future. I would definitely go and see them. Keep up the good work Johnny!!!!!!!! I hope to see as much of your movies possible.",Secret Window
433,Vibers,Major disappointment,3,11 June 2004,"Being a fan of Johnny Depp's ability as an actor, and his ability to pick out great scripts, Depp usually has that type of presence on the screen that can bring an mediocre film to be enjoyable experience. And as usual, i was looking forward to this movie as well... But this time, he just looked just ...uninspired.SPOILER WARNING I must say, i love movies like the 6th sense, fight club and memento, when the ending takes you by complete surprise.. There is nothing wrong with an movie having an obvious ending, but being a movie with a surprise ending, i can't feel anything other than ripped of when the twist is obvious after 20 minutes, after that the movie is just painful seeing Depp(and John Turturro for that sake) so uncomfortable under such a lousy director(Yes i put the blame on him).The only reason i can think of for anyone to watch this movie, is if they are somewhat masochistic and want to punish them self.. Awful movie, steer clear!!!",Secret Window
434,andymaxwell,positive with negative suggestions!,7,30 June 2004,"I thought this was a 9 out of 10 film until the twist at the end. It turned into a mini fight-club but with none of the intelligent disguise. Johnny depp was very good in the role, playing a very believable character. I immediately liked the film, Johnny Depp instantly grabbed you and the camera work was excellent with some very well designed shots which didn't over-rule the action. It was setup with a very good intro (5mins), which lead nicely into the main body of the film set six months after the introduction. Mort Rainey (Depp) finds his wife in bed with another man and leaves her, heading up to his cabin in the mountains for some peace whilst he starts a new book. Mort, a well known writer (who has writers block) has only his dog for company. He gets a visit from a stranger from the south who claims Mort stole his idea for a story and turned it into a best-selling novel some 6 years earlier. Mort refuses to believe this and the stranger leaves after leaving some veiled threats and a copy of the manuscript. When Mort reads it he finds it to be word-by-word the same as his story. Having had some adverse attention from a 'fan' some time earlier he is keen to have this guy out of his life as soon as possible, even though he did not plagiarize the work. Things turn nasty when he finds his beloved dog murdered.....",Secret Window
435,captainskye,"Perfect Story, Perfect Ending",10,14 July 2004,"I read the short story, 'Secret Window Secret Garden' by Steven King, about a year ago. It was one that played on my mind, a memorable piece. Steven King always has had the ability through his writing to enable even those with very little imagination to feel, live and see through the eyes of his characters. However, unfortunately the same can't always be said for the movie adaptations of his books. Some are excellent and well made but others although gripping during the main part of the plot weaken toward the end and don't usually do justice to the wonderful climatic endings of his original stories. In 'Secret Window' the importance of the climax of a story is an emphatic point and this picture certainly proves it. It is unlike most Steven King adaptations because the ending in this one is perfect. It ties it together and gives the viewer more to think about than 'happily ever after'. The ending is in fact different to that of the story and this is maybe one of those rare occurrences where you think perhaps Mr. King should have written the original story that way as it seems to make a little more sense.Overall this movie is in my opinion a great success and does more than justice to Steven Kings work. Johnny Depp as Morton Rainey was not exactly what I imagined from reading the book. I suppose if someone had suggested it to me at the time I would have said he doesn't look average enough, as Morton Rainey seems to be you're ""average Joe"" at the beginning of the story. I was certainly wrong as Johnny Depp took the role and fit it incredibly well. Now I flick back through the pages of the story and I think that now that character belongs to the face of Johnny Depp, though he is blessed with an angelic but manly beauty he is after all just a man like every other and is an exquisitely talented actor who is capable of adopting and bringing to life any manner of character.There is no disappointment to be found here, from a vivid and compelling piece of literature has come a thrilling and masterful film which simply provides the window through which to view it.",Secret Window
436,shortstack2731,Lovin it,9,18 July 2004,"I loved this movie. Watching it at night in the dark is a sure way to creep yourself out. The ending was by far the best part, that and the fact that Johnny Depp can pull off that whole ""dishevelled-bitter-completely-insane"" thing while still looking amazing. The fast paced script is almost written specifically for this cast. The actors keep the action going and keep the viewer on the edge of their seat. I couldn't stop watching it, and watched it a second time to make sure I had understood everything. I would also recommend reading the book after seeing the movie, because it is just as good as the film. If you like Stephen King, or any of Johnny's other movies, you'll love Secret Window.",Secret Window
437,afogelty,A++ Performance. Johnny Depp is flawless.,9,26 July 2004,"Johnny Depp delivers a memorizing performance. The movie follows him and he adds quite a bit in the way he plays the character. He gives depth and quirks (sleeping on the couch in ratty clothes, bluntness, and a sarcastic wit) to a character that another actor may have portrayed more rigidly and more predictably. Overall, the movie surprised me with the ending which was a pleasant surprise because it was not a typical Hollywood ending. Also, I am a huge Stephen King fan so the imagination in this movie ranks way up there. A lot of what I liked about the movie was the interaction between the characters that are almost humorous at points. There are also some very catchy quotes that the actors say in the movie. Overall, I would give the movie an A++.",Secret Window
438,JuliusGryphon,Great performances in a bad movie,5,23 September 2004,"I'm always skeptical when I hear of yet another Stephen King story being made into a movie. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy King's writing...but movie adaptations of his works don't exactly have a great track record. But, this time around I was optimistic because of the talent involved. And that talent didn't let me down. John Turturro is a consistently good actor who gives a consistently good performance. And Johhny Depp once again shows us how he can take any character and make it his own. He is able to instill his roles with incredibly entertaining personalities while still making them believable. I would almost recommend this movie solely for the enjoyment of watching Depp perform.The problem is that no amount of great acting could save this movie. It's predictable, drawn out, and plain silly at times. And for some reason, it ends about 15 minute too late. After the final climatic scene, there is a completely unnecessary wrap-up scene that I guess answers one or two questions. But they are questions the viewer doesn't really want/need answered and it doesn't answer them in a very satisfactory manner anyway. Cutting off that last scene wouldn't help this movie...but it sure couldn't hurt.So, if you're like me and will watch Depp in almost anything, check this out to admire his skills. Just don't expect a good movie.",Secret Window

I really liked the suspense that was building inside of me, i couldn't wait to see what would happen next. And finally the end was really really what got me to like the movie. The end really laid the path for me to actually write a comment about a movie (seeing as this is my first). Johnny Depp plays very well as Mort Rainey, and in my opinion fit the character very well. As for ""John Shooter"", John Turturro plays exceptionally well as ""the bad guy"" but turns out to be Mort Rainey's other ""self"" which really got me to like the movie.

But, it is practically the same story! Stephen King is copying himself! I guess there is a certain irony in that. Of course, the names had been changed to protect the innocent. Am I the only one who sees this? Certainly, there has been a comparison somewhere. I am very disappointed in Mr. King and the film industry. They should have marketed it as a remake.

Johnny Depp's character is so unlikeable, that after just 30 minutes I had grown tired of it. There are no sympathetic characters in this movie. With the exception of the Sheriff, all the characters are cold, and downright nasty. In addition, I was offended by the fact that the writers of the movie went out of their way to hide the fact that part of the movie is set in what is supposed to be an area of the Bronx known as Riverdale. They would not even acknowledge that Riverdale, NY is policed by the NYPD. Instead the detective from Riverdale, identifies himself as a member of the Riverdale police department... No such thing. I guess we couldn't be allowed to think that Johnny Depp could ever live in the Bronx. And what was with his weird accent??? This movie is a must NOT see !!!",Secret Window
444,kenberry-1,"Depp is Great, but...",4,9 February 2005,"...the story by King is such an old plot dating back to Shirley Jackson in ""The Birds Nest"", circa the 1950's, dealing with a ""multiple personality"" -- indeed, I wonder if King or the screen writers had perhaps read this (as well as the many similar others) and perhaps it influenced them. I imagine that most fans of the novel and those knowledgeable of cinema history could determine the story and conclusion within the first 20 minutes. Talented Depp can overcome weakness of most screen plays, but he almost didn't in this one. After seeing it once, I won't be buying the CD.I see that I must write more in order for my comments to be posted; however, I do not want to give the plot, such as it is, away.

The man had multiple personalities and yes you do guess it in the beginning but it's a twist on that cliché. It wasn't a dream, he actually killed all those people but did it when he ""was"" John Shooter. And yes Johnny Depp did carry this movie, but they left out some important details from Stephen King's novella ""Secret Window, Secret Garden"" I loved this movie, it's quirky, fun and keeps me entertained, which most movies like this are out there to do.

Alas, the folks behind Secret Window either really, really, really hope you never saw Fight Club or hope that you saw it, but never really got it.I figured Secret Window out early on, and was able to spend the rest of the movie watching each scene as though I were watching it for that ""holy cow, that blew my mind. I totally have to watch it again"" second time. Frankly, I feel that's the only way to view it. When seen from the omniscient point of view, the one the story's creators hoped you wouldn't figure out before the big reveal, the story is an interesting study of a broken man. Viewed from its intended paradigm, where you only know (and presumably are able to intuit) what Mort knows, this movie sucks. That is why I'm helping everyone out. If you haven't seen this movie, and wanted to read the spoiler, here it is: Mort Rainey went nuts when his wife left him.

I recently viewed Secret Window with a friend from the safety of my own home. It's only a short movie, which in itself has appeal, and if it were any longer the suspense element would have most definitely fizzled away. The first hour or so nothing much happens, the story line just plods along and you wait and watch to look for anything you have missed and wonder whether the story is going to go anywhere. The first portion of the movie is not a complete failure, however, as Johnny Depp once again shines in his role and keeps the viewer somewhat interested. Once the twist kicks in, the movie takes the viewer to a whole new level. My friend and I were simply intrigued in horror.

Of course, movies with Johnny Depp playing in it are always nice to watch, but it depends on more than just the handsome actors. I wouldn't say it's one of my favorite movies, but I think you should see it some time. The actors are chosen very carefully and my opinion is that Johnny Depp and John Turturro are perfect for their roles. I would say: if you like thrillers, just watch it and make your own conclusions.

Depp is a writer, and through a brilliant scheme, generated by just plain genius(?) or first-class insanity(?), he manages a solution to make him feel better... does he really sort out his emotions successfully by action, or by hiding himself within the pages of a story that would make him feel good about himself?? You would be puzzled all through the movie, but you would always appreciate things from Depp's perspective, no matter the case--you know how Depp can make you like him:)... Depp's a genius--interlacing the thriller with well done humorous acts and funny remarks! Good acting.

While he was doing all of the things to protect himself from this bad man, he was actually the bad man! Schizophrenics don't BECOME the person they are afraid of, per se. I mean, he didn't do those things because he was told to, but because the other personality took over control of his body. When we saw the multiple ""Johnnys"" in the living room of the cabin...that was so we would finally understand. He was not the only one in that head of his. And that he was always that Bad Man who hurt the dog and threatened him. He had even bought that hat years ago, the wife said.I don't think this was about him doing what voices told him to do.
