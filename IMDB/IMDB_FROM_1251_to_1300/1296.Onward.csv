0,MartinHafer,Good...not great.,7,6 April 2020,"""Onward"" is a beautiful film to watch, and so as usual a Pixar film is among the best looking CGI movies you can find. I especially love the look of the twilight scenes. This being said, the story itself is only okay...and the big finale is a bit of a letdown.In this story, magical folk like sprites, trolls, elves and goblins are real but have somehow lost their magical powers over the centuries...mostly because modern technology replaced many of the spells of yesterday. The plot focuses on two brothers who have an odd task...to bring their dead father back to life for one day. Through this process, they naturally come to learn about themselves and each other.There are some touching moments in this film. But there also is a strong feeling that the story itself wasn't especially logical or polished. The characters, their motivations and the like all seem a bit confusing and slight....and the ending seemed more action-packed than being true to the characters and story. In fact, many will likely see the ending as a letdown...and the entire reason for the brothers' quest seemed amazingly unimportant and irrelevant. Not a terrible story by any stretch...but certainly not among the studios better films. And, it's a clear case of a film being rushed to market before the story was adequately polished and ready to be filmed.",Onward
1,TheLittleSongbird,A bond of two brothers,9,6 April 2021,"The premise for 'Onward' is a good one if not unique. Pixar have more creative concepts than the one here, such as 'Inside Out', 'Soul' and 'Coco'. Pixar has not been as consistent in the 2010s compared to before, more though when it comes to its sequels and prequels. The studio was very consistently high quality up to 'Toy Story 3' and has varied since that film in my view. 'Onward' is one of two, and the first, of their films released in 2020, the other being 'Soul'.For me, 'Soul' was the marginally better film, more imaginative and more ambitious without being overly so. Yet 'Onward' is a great film in its own way and worthy of more attention than it does. Is it the most original film in the world story-wise? No, absolutely not though sometimes lack of originality is not always a bad thing (it's when it goes too far on that where it matters). It is good though that many liked or loved it. Pretty much all of what makes the studio's output when on particularly good form so high quality though are here in 'Onward'. While it is not one of their best, it's relatively under-appreciated.Very little wrong here in 'Onward'. Other than the lack of originality, the only thing that could have been better is that if the pacing slowed down a little towards the end.'Onward' however is highly successful in every other regard. The animation is stunning as has nearly always been the case (the only exception actually has been some of the character designs in 'The Good Dinosaur'), with such beautiful colours and meticulously detailed backgrounds. The music is always dynamic with the action and is never at odds with it, full of character, energy and pathos. The script is a perfect balance of genuinely hilarious humour and moving and not too sentimental emotion.Pixar always did have mature storytelling, especially apparent in almost all the non-sequel output since 'Inside Out' (and including that film). 'Onward' is one of the particularly mature ones in this period and one of their particularly mature ones overall. For what it may lack in originality, 'Onward' more than makes up for it in exciting and nostalgic action, hilarious entertainment value, affecting (but not over-sentimental) emotional power and affectionate honouring of the fantasy genre.It is also hugely successful in its depiction of the relationship between the brothers (doing for brothers what the 'Frozen' films did for sisters), a beautifully and realistically written bond that was also hugely insightful and relatable. Will admit that the ending did make me cry, one of Pixar's most poignant endings. The characters felt real and didn't come over as too perfect or have negative characteristics over-emphasised. The voice acting is on point, with Tom Holland being particularly splendid and the bond between him and Chris Pratt felt authentic.Concluding, wonderful. 9/10.",Onward
2,SnoopyStyle,the search for magic,7,18 April 2020,"Once upon a time, the world was filled with magic but scientific conveniences eventually replaced magic. In the modern world, elf Ian Lightfoot (Tom Holland) lacks confidence, turning 16, and pines for his dead father whom he never met. His brash older brother Barley (Chris Pratt) is obsessed with the old forgotten magic. One day, their mother (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) finds an old magic staff of their father. Ian uses it to bring back his father but he's only half successful.This could be counted as a failure when compared to the standard exceptional Pixar levels. It just doesn't have that usual Pixar MAGIC. Firstly, the movie should not have started with a magical world introduction. We want to discover it along with the characters, not wait for them to catch up with us. Secondly, the emotional button needs to get hit a lot harder. Up devastated the audience in the first five minutes. This movie needs that so the ending can punch even harder. Quite frankly, the material is in the movie already. It doesn't quite have the power. Thirdly, the half father is weird visually. Without the top, it feels everybody is looking at his crotch. There has to be a better way. Weekend at Bernie's would be a better idea. This is a step down from my Pixar expectations.",Onward
3,kosmasp,We go,9,18 March 2020,"And as you would expect from Pixar, the quality of everything is really good! Be it characters, development, story, jokes, ""drawings""/animation and much more. It really hits home (no pun intended) and always is able to touch your heart. While we are now housebound more or less and for the foreseeable future, this was nice to see in a cinema while I could.There are some cliches and some things that are predictable, but the movie builds a world that makes sense in itself and works within the rules it sets for itself. So yes suspension of disbelief, but a coherent one, where you can be sure that no rules it sets up are being broken (at least not in an overtly obvious way).",Onward
4,jboothmillard,Onward,7,15 March 2020,"As far as I can recall, I have seen a few average films, but never a bad film from Disney/Pixar, this was the twenty-second feature film to be released, and it looked like it could be good fun, directed by Dan Scanlon (Monsters University). Basically, set in a world inhabited by mythical creatures, magic was commonplace a long time ago. But due to the difficulty of mastering it and advancing technological over the years, the use of magic became obsolete and heavily discarded. In this modern day, in the city of New Mushroomton, lives elf high-schooler Ian Lightfoot (Tom Holland), who lacks self-confidence, and his older brother Barley, a historical fanatic whom Ian finds embarrassing. Their father Wilden (Kyle Bornheimer) died of a severe illness shortly before Ian's birth, leaving their mother Laurel (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) to raise them. Since then, Laurel has a new boyfriend, centaur police officer Colt Bronco (Mel Rodriguez), whom the boys do not like that much. On Ian's sixteenth birthday, Laurel gives the brothers a gift from Wilden. It is a magical staff, a rare gem, and a letter describing a ""visitation spell"" that can resurrect a dead person for 24 hours. Barley attempts to cast the spell, but they feel upset when nothing happens. Later that night, Ian picks up the staff and speaks the chant, accidentally succeeding in casting the spell. However, the power of the chant is too strong for Ian to control, and the gem disintegrates before the spell is completed. Only the lower half of Wilden's body is physically reformed. Resolving to fix their mistake, the brothers leave on a quest in Barley's beloved van ""Guinevere"". They hope to acquire another gem to reattempt the spell. Laurel finds the boys gone soon after and leaves to find them. Barley has read about the legendary Manitore, who possesses a map to the gem. He and Ian visit the Manticore's Tavern, but it has become a family restaurant and the Manticore (with the body and head of a lion, the wings of a dragon, and the tail of a scorpion), Corey (Octavia Spencer), is its uptight manager. In an argument with Ian over the map, Corey realises how boring her life has become. The customers are driven away when she goes into a fit of rage, accidentally setting fire to the restaurant and the map. The only clue the brothers have now is on a children's menu, a solved puzzle clue reading ""Raven's Point"", a nearby mountain, as a possible location of the gem. Laurel later arrives at the restaurant and befriends Corey, who calms down and agrees to help her. Corey warns her that brothers in their journey may awaken a curse which can only be defeated by a special sword. They find it at a pawn shop, the owner Grecklin (Tracey Ullman) initially sees as a trinket, until she hears Corey describe its value, but she temporarily paralyses the owner, allowing them to steal it. Ian and Barley reach the outskirts of New Mushroomton and into a mountainous area. They unintentionally anger a motorcycle gang of pixies, but eventually manage to escape them. They are also pulled over by the police but manage to trick them using a spell to impersonate Colt. Ian's newfound spell-casting abilities and Barley's instinct for where the gem might be hidden are bringing the brothers closer together and more determined to see their deceased father again. They discover that ""Raven's Point"" is a hint to follow the directions indicated by a series of raven statues. They reach a large gorge with the lever to the drawbridge the opposite side it. Ian casts a spell to cast an invisible bridge beneath his feet to cross the gorge and avoid the never-ending fall. However, Colt catches up to them, calling in reinforcements. Cornered in the mountains, Barley sacrifices his van by making it drive into a bunch of rocks, causing them to fall onto the road to stop the police from catching them. The brothers follow the crow statues, with the last one pointing underground. In the cave below they avoid a series of traps, deadly creatures, escape the flooding tunnel, and cast a spell to grow a cheese puff and speed it downriver. Finally, they reach a light and surface to find themselves in front of Ian's high school. Ian is angry and blames Barley for leading them on a goose chase and walks away with the legs of Wilden. Sitting along with Wilden, Ian realises that Barley has been with him ever since he was a child, and has served as an effective father figure, including during their recent quest. Barley notices a flower-shaped hole in a fountain and fills it with a rock he took from one of the bird statues, triggering the fountain to open and reveal the gem. As he takes the stone, and Ian returns to make amends with him, the curse activates. The high school is turned into an artificial dragon bent on claiming the gem. Ian tries to fight the dragon with the staff, but it is knocked from his grip and into the ocean. He manages to reform a new staff from a splinter embedded in his hand and continues the fight. Corey flies in carrying Laurel, who plunges the magic sword into the dragon's heart. The dragon is weakened long enough for Ian to cast the visitation spell and fully reform Wilden's body. Ian sends Barley ahead to give his goodbye to Wilden, before the sun sets, while he holds off the dragon long enough for Laurel to destroy it. After Wilden disappears, Barley tells Ian that Wilden is proud of him and the brothers share a hug. Ian's confidence and spellcasting improve, and he surprises Barley by painting his new van, the ""Guinevere 2"". Corey reopens her tavern in its original spirit, drawing in customers with tales of her past adventures, and Ian and Barley go on further quests. Also starring Lena Waithe as Officer Specter, Ali Wong as Officer Gore and John Ratzenberger as Fenwick. Holland is splendidly cast as the teenage elf, as is Pratt as his enthusiastic brother, Spencer is also worth mentioning as the wise-cracking Manitore. I agree with film critic Mark Kermode, the first two thirds of the film are simple fun filled with good humour and pacey sequences, the real heart does indeed come in the final act, all in all it is enjoyable entertainment for all ages, a worthwhile computer-animated fantasy comedy-drama adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Animated. Very good!",Onward
5,paul_haakonsen,This was spectacular...,9,17 April 2020,"When I sat down to watch ""Onward"" with my 10 year old son, I had no idea what I was in for here, except for it being an animated movie. I had definitely not expected it to turn out to be one of the most entertaining and enjoyable animated movies I have ever seen.""Onward"" hit the spot and spoke straight to my geeky spirit, as I have been playing Dungeons & Dragons and other such roleplaying games for 34 years, so ""Onward"" was such a glorious treat for me. Total nerdgasm was imminent.The storyline was good, as it appealed to both youngsters and adults alike. There literally is something for just everyone in the audience to enjoy here. I definitely took in all the geek references to fantasy roleplaying games. Not to mention that the older brother in the movie was a spot on fit for whom I am.The CGI animation was smooth and good, which definitely added a lot of enjoyment to the movie. As did all the characters and the overwhelming amount of details in the scenes. There was just so much to take in that the movie can be watched more than once, believe you me.With this being an animated movie, having a proper voice cast is alpha and omega, and needless to say that they had a great ensemble together for doing the voices for the various characters throughout the movie. Tom Holland and Chris Pratt were definitely carrying the movie phenomenally. Then you have the likes of Octavia Spencer and Ali Wong in supportive roles, whom individually definitely spruced up the movie for me - just a shame they didn't have more prominent roles.""Onward"" blindsided me and caught me completely off-guard. I am rating it a solid nine out of ten stars, and this is an animated movie that I can warmly and highly recommend that you find and take the time to sit down and watch. Well worth the time and effort, trust me.",Onward
6,studioAT,Onward,6,11 July 2020,"Pixar's 22nd feature film, 'Onward' may have been denied a long cinema run due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but it is well worth watching now.It's a slow burner, I'll warn you that now, but when it does get going it's a fun and emotional film, all about the importance of brotherhood, family, and the journey's we take in life.The bar is set very high where Pixar films are concerned, and people do have very high expectations of them, but I thought this was an enjoyable entry from them.",Onward
7,Calicodreamin,Too cute!,8,11 May 2020,"A fun and wholesome adventure to discover that sometimes what you always needed was with you all along. The story is a unique take on mythical creatures and magic, pitting ancient sorcery and new age technology. The characters are well developed and the storyline had good flow. Lots of fun and heartfelt moments. Lovely!",Onward
8,view_and_review,Waiting for the payoff,7,11 March 2020,"I had the opportunity to watch this movie in a nearly empty theater. I don't know if ""Onward"" failed to garner the attraction of your average Disney movie or if COVID-19 played a larger hand in the occupancy. Either way, more space for me.In ""Onward"" Peter Quill and Peter Parker team up... or should I say Chris Pratt and Tom Holland team up for the movie ""Onward."" This was a movie of waiting for the payoff. The beginning and middle were so-so, while the ending was exceptional.Ian and Barkley Lightfoot (Peter Holland and Chris Pratt) are brother elves. They live in a modern age in which magic is no longer used due to modern technology. They also live in a world without their dad, that is until they were gifted a spell that would allow them to see him for a day. The spell goes wrong and they're only able to materialize the lower half of their deceased father, but if they could get another Phoenix Stone they could materialize all of him.""Onward"" is essentially an adventure movie where the adventure is of the medieval sort being carried out in a modern world with smartphones, highways, and high rises. It's a humanless world of elves, pixies, minotaurs, ogres, and other mythical creatures. The quest Ian and Barkley were on was somewhat interesting, but it was the end of their quest that had the most appeal.",Onward
9,evanston_dad,Sub-Par Pixar,6,22 March 2021,"Pixar is getting lazy.This movie is the second bland, generic Pixar release this year (the other being ""Soul""). Neither of these movies came close to capturing the magic of Pixar at its best -- ""The Incredibles,"" ""WALL-E,"" ""Toy Story 3"" -- instead falling back on the kinds of meaningless platitudes you might find on those inspirational posters you see hanging on the wall in work places, or those cross stitched messages hanging on the wall at grandma's house.""Onward"" is the blah blah story about a young man who thinks he's lacking in all these qualities that he then realizes in the course of a journey he's really had inside him all along. All I could think about while watching this movie was the ending of the stage musical ""Urinetown,"" where the heroine tells all the townspeople living in a world without water that the the glass of water they crave has been inside them all along. Then they all die of thirst.Grade: B-",Onward
10,ferguson-6,Manticore! Manticore!,7,5 March 2020,"Greetings again from the darkness. No studio has ever had a 25 year run like Pixar. This is their 22nd feature film over that span and every single one lands somewhere in the range of brilliant/instant classic to watchable/re-watchable. Though this latest may not reach instant classic level, it does stick to the Pixar standard template of highly entertaining while delivering a life lesson. This is the first time in the Pixar director's chair for Dan Scanlon since MONSTERS UNIVERSITY (2013). It's also the first original Pixar since COCO (2017) ... and note, it's rated PG.The film opens with a ""history"" lesson detailing how the world was once populated by enchanted creatures like elves, unicorns, wizards, mermaids, fairies and sprites. Science and technology created shortcuts and soon the world's ""magic"" had disappeared, relegating these creatures to life in the suburbs. We pick up the story on Ian Lightfoot's 16th birthday. Ian is part of an elf family that includes his older brother Barley and their widowed mother Laurel. While Barley is a loud and rambunctious type who is obsessed with the Quest of Yore game and mythology (think Dungeons & Dragons), Ian is a more pensive type who still mourns the late father he never met. Both brothers are surprised when their mother presents a ""gift"" from their dad - one he left instructions to be held until Ian turned 16. The gift is a magical wizard staff that, with the included precious stone, can bring dad back to life for 24 hours.Barley's knowledge of the magical spells combined with Ian's lack of self-confidence ends up botching things to the point that only half of dad is brought back - the bottom half. Under a tight deadline and in need of a replacement gem to bring dad back for a much desired final conversation, the brothers take off on an adventure that turns pretty wild. Their quest leads them to cross paths with many of the previously enchanted creatures, including the fabulous Manticore, and mom's boyfriend, Officer Colt Bronco.We have come to expect 'magic' from Pixar with every movie, and this one doesn't disappoint. It may not be quite as awe-inspiring as some of their best work, but it's still a terrific suburban fantasy adventure filled with comedy and life lessons ... the most crucial of which is: being happy with what you have is more crucial to your inner-peace than getting what you hope for.As always, the voice acting is top notch. Tom Holland (SPIDER-MAN: HOMECOMING) delivers the goods as Ian, and Chris Pratt (GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY) brings the necessary wonder and excitement to brother Barley. Julia Louis-Dreyfus never really gets to shine as their mother, but then this story is focused on the boys. Octavia Spencer has fun as Manticore (we needed more Manticore!), Mel Rodriguez is a hoot as Officer Colt Bronco, and yes of course, John Ratzenberg sneaks in - he's now voiced a character in all 22 Pixar films.This is the first Pixar film to be totally free of input from ousted President John Lasseter, and it's one of the very few to be released outside of the summer or awards season. The likely reason is that the studio has a second original film being released this June. SOUL will be directed by Pete Docter and is viewed as a companion piece to the already classic INSIDE OUT (2015). Given the time of year, it could be easy to overlook ONWARD, but it nails the Pixar trademark emotional finale ... delivering a sentimental scene likely to stick with you. I have praised Pixar many times over the years as their creative teams really seem to ""get it"". Regardless of the month, ONWARD will cast a spell.",Onward
11,Mr-Fusion,Excelsior!,7,20 April 2020,"There's something about the character design in ""Onward"" that suggests ""Zootopia"" rather than a PIXAR movie; I think that's the reason for my indifference toward the marketing. But I'm as surprised as anyone because this is a fun one.Two words: Chris Pratt, putting his back into a character that's all-too-eager to dive right into the next adventure. He's earnest, unassuming and nothing short of a pleasure. Case in point, the entire gas station sequence. Something as simple as speeding up the voice to a high pitch turns out to be hysterical. I haven't laughed this hard at a PIXAR movie in a long time; and the bottom line is that this is a quest I thoroughly enjoyed.",Onward
12,ksf-2,okay story of trying to connect with lost father,6,21 July 2021,"Elves. Magic, spells, adventure, as the narrator tells us right at the start. Stars Tom Holland and Chris Pratt as Ian and Barley, two brothers, who lost their dad when they were very young. Julia Louis Dreyfus (Elaine !) is Mom. Some other familiar voices in here... Ali Wong, John Ratzenberger, Tracy Ullman. Octavia Spencer is ""the manticore"". Apparently, dad found a way for them to be together again, will it work? Well, kind of. It's a cross between the hobbit and harry potter. With maps. Spells. Wizards who now run restaurants. Gelatinous cubes (look it up)! Maybe even training your dragon. It's okay.

13,lasttimeisaw,Cinema Omnivore - Onward (2020) 7.3/10,7,4 January 2021,"""ONWARD is a purely boyish adventure that preschool kids can be transfixed for a goodly 102 minutes, influenced by RPG like Dungeons and Dragons, peopled with fantasticated creatures like elf, goblin, unicorn, cyclops, faun, centaur, manticore and a bunch of fiery pixies (all given bouncy personal traits that often amusingly contrast with their appearances, Spencer and Ullman are my picks for locutionary excellence), to say nothing of the final antagonist in the form of a giant dragon-shaped golem (no derelict parents or evil adults to be the obstructive force, just an ancient curse).""read the full review on my blog: cinema omnivore, thanks",Onward
14,cherold,pleasant kid's movie,6,9 May 2020,"This lesser Pixar film takes place in a world where magical creatures have embraced modern technology and forgotten all about magic. But when two boys inherit a magic staff, they encounter and power and pitfalls of magic while the protagonist finds his inner strength.This is a cute little movie. It starts slow but picks up when the magic starts, Octavia Spencer makes an amusing manticore, and that final dragon is an ingenious creation.But while Pixar films like Wall-E, Up, and Toy Story transcend the kid-friendly nature of American animation, Onward is very much a movie aimed at the young that lacks the depth of the best Pixar films. It's all perfectly fine and I'm torn between giving it a 6 or a 7, but in spite of some humor and touching moments there's not really much to it.Perfectly skippable.",Onward
15,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Onward and upward.,8,8 March 2020,"Although its world - which basically comes down to ""what if 'Dungeons & Dragons' was a historical text?"" - isn't as immediately gripping or generally interesting as the stuff that Pixar usually produce, 'Onward (2020)' doesn't take long to get you hooked on its charismatic central dynamic, well-worn but effective story and unusually powerful emotion. It's a very classic adventure right the way through, but that doesn't mean it doesn't work. While the flick starts out a little slow and, even, unsteady, it soon settles into itself. It's, as I've mentioned, a well-worn tale at its core, but it keeps you engaged with its enjoyable set-pieces and resonant relationships. Even if you know where it's going, you're still along for the ride. It's very entertaining. It juggles a fair few balls and doesn't drop a single one, coming together in an expected but satisfying finale that gives way to its most impactful aspect: the practically Pixar-patented emotional resonance. This is easily its most subversive aspect as, although the thing sets up some potentially affecting payoffs, it sneaks up on you with an unanticipated musing on a type of relationship that's always been in plain sight but never explicitly focused on. Basically, there's nothing in the film to prepare you for just how affecting its final moments are. I certainly teared up and I'm not ashamed to admit it. This is why people just can't get enough of Pixar, who've rarely put a foot wrong. The animation house understands that classic storytelling is classic for a reason, so focus on imbuing their story with mature, surprisingly poignant themes. They never make movies for kids, they just make movies that the whole family can enjoy. This piece continues that trend and sits more-than-comfortably among its siblings. It's rather great, actually. Needless to say, it looks stunning, too. 8/10",Onward

Onward presents story beats that rival some of Pixar's best over the years with a touching final 15 minutes that catapulted this film up the ranks on this studio's finest work. And most of all, I think the film's ultimate message is one of utmost importance and something we can all learn from.

18,Cineanalyst,Indifferent,5,27 January 2021,"""Onward"" is the first Pixar feature that I don't care about. It's so thoroughly uninteresting that it provokes no strong feelings. It's neither as astounding as the studio's best hits since ""Toy Story"" (1995) revolutionized computer animation, nor as deserving of derision as something so atrociously derivative as, say, ""Monsters University"" (2013).The explicit quest narrative is solid plotting. But, the magic is uninspired. The borrowings from other fantasy entertainments--the Magic: The Gathering cards and Dungeons & Dragons game--are obvious. You won't see anything here that hasn't already been done better in a Peter Jackson trilogy or countless other fantasy installments. It's the usual wizards, elves, fairies, centaurs and unicorns stuff. The one-note joke that such magic doesn't fit into the modern world is distinctly unfunny--mostly just resulting in the misshapen creatures knocking things over. It's akin to a cartoon version of ""Bright"" (2017) in this respect, and that's not a compliment.The brotherly and fatherly mush isn't so much overly sentimental as it's plain dull. In between the sweeping ""camera"" movements to begin and end the picture, the animation is relatively unremarkable, too.",Onward
19,cricketbat,"It's got heart, but it's missing humor",6,7 April 2020,"In the past, most Pixar movies have had a near-perfect mix of heart, head (clever writing), and humor. Onward definitely has the heart, as I got emotional a few times while watching it, but it's missing the humor and the head. This movie isn't as funny as I hoped it would be, and it seems to be making up rules and scenarios as the story goes along. I liked it, but I don't see this animated feature as a classic that my kids will want to re-watch it over and over again.",Onward

Usual fantasy magic plot of a Merlin like magical staff made of twisted wood; staff has usual electrical & levitating forces; usual magical gem; usual incantations from usual magical spell book. Very bizarre character creations & behaviors with an attempt to con-temporize, but was just a mishmash, e.g. half horse half person centaur like creature; miniature flying bikers; dad cut in half; a dragon made of broken concrete pieces. Not sure what audience they were targeting.",Onward
21,ironhorse_iv,This enchanting motion picture is truly magically. It's worth seeing. Onward!,8,8 April 2020,"This contemporary fantasy about two elf brothers Ian (Voiced by Tom Holland) & Barley Lightfoot (Voiced by Chris Pratt) on their quest to find a resurrection gem that will bring back their departed love one home for one day was majestic & spellbinding! Those are the words that best describe the first non-sequel flick produced by Pixar for Disney since 2017 animation feature 'Coco'. Much like that holiday picture directed by Lee Unkrich, this movie also dealt with the themes of love and loss in a similar way. However, the film written and directed by Dan Scanlon doesn't reach the high levels of tear jerking emotional from most of Pixar's previous movies due to the absence of establishing who the demise father really was even with the powerful scene with the tape recording. Don't get me wrong, the film is still moving, but just think how much more powerful the movie could had been if they add surrounding characters POV musical perspective flashbacks of him rather than hard to connection sign language gesture with footsteps of the silence man trying to emote feelings. The film could also had put a little more pressure into the race against time concept with the father slowly disappearing due to the spell not being completed. It would had made the quest more compelling. Another problem with the movie is that the world building. It's not quite as rich and epic as it had. Don't get me wrong, the urban fantasy is done better here than films like 2017 'Bright'. However, it does lean too heavily on clichés modern day society tropes and archetypes. For example, their society has cars that looks like it was built for humanoids when the world is made out majority of creatures that isn't that shape. It kinda bug me. Another is how similar the technological innovation of their world match ours. Rather than phones, I wish they had advanced scientifically crystal balls or cauldron like machines. Lots of unique miss opportunities here. It's especially disappointing when you compare this settling to their past works like 2006's 'Cars' and more recent Walt Disney animation movies world building locations like 2016's 'Zootopia' & 2014's 'Big Hero Six'. Look, I get that the world of 'Onward' abandoned magic but the idea that science and inventing is a lot easier to learn than mystics is jarring when Ian figure out a lot of spells in the course of one day. Then there is the idea that many of the residents are unaware of their species basic abilities. For example, if the pixies don't use their wings much due to technology, wouldn't evolution take those abilities away seeing how science exist in this world? Also, even if they could use them; it takes creatures several weeks to learn to fly even in life or death situation. As for the treasure hunt; there is several problems with the logistic of it. First off, I can understand how the two can find their way back home after going to Raven's Point. After all, they didn't really start their adventure until reaching the tavern at a different location. So, they had to travel further miles in the complete opposite direction to find the enigmatic foundation which they didn't know they could have skip. What I don't get is how they reach their own city in time; seeing how they walk the last third to Raven's Point & then took a slow boat ride back to town. It does not match with the many hours they spent driving to the point in their van the first time. Unless, ships made out of food in this world move in supersonic speeds which I highly doubt. To add onto that, the clichés third act in which one of the members abandoned the mission only to return is really overdone. There is no way they can reunited on time. Nor would any of the supporting characters and their magic sword join them as they wouldn't have that knowledge of the fountain location as well. Furthermore, the establishment of the quest is not well explained. Who hid the phoenix gem in the first place and created a trap filled dungeon? Also how did the father gain access to the first gem? It's seems unlikely that a very ill elf went to a similar journey to find one. The repetitive narrative opening and climax doesn't really help, because of that the story is very inconsistent even with the film's strong use of foreshadowing. Regardless, I did like humor and nods to the board game Dungeons & Dragons and company time as a subsidiary of Chuck E. Cheese. It was funny. As for the acting. The two leads were decent even if their characters can be a bit annoying at times. Yet, their performance just doesn't stand out as much due to how similar their roles in this film when compare to the characters, they played in the Marvel movies. Nevertheless, the supporting cast was also pretty good. As for the animation. Even with the Guinevere controversial, I still find the movie stunning. However, I really do believe that Pixar has stolen another artist's unicorn themed mural. After all, the artist has a good case as the company rented her vehicle for a festival. They look nearly alike. The film also featured the first post-20th Century Fox acquisition. The Simpsons animated short 'Playdate with Destiny' that played before the feature film was fine. Still it was weird to heard that this movie & it's short was banned in the middle east due to an off end improvised line about a lesbian couple. Nevertheless, unfortunately, you can't watch 'Onward' no longer in the theaters because of the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the company made the unprecedented move of making the film available for digital download on Disney Plus. Even with the service many flaws. The movie is worth checking out on there. So, grab a second breakfast and seek this out.",Onward

It has a fun premise, a road trip, with a good bit of brother bonding, a hit of Weekend At Bernie's thrown one, an emotional ending you don't expect, a strong message and a few laughs.It's pretty adult orientated to be honest. It's got things in there for kids, but I don't think they will understand the life lessons and messages in there, as it's much more adult orientated. At times especially the ending, I thought ""Damn. That is dark. Did they HAVE to go there""?Tom Holland and Chris Pratt (I honesty think his character was meant for Jack Black) are decent as the main voices.

24,paulclaassen,Actually more emotional than I could ever have imagined...,5,10 June 2020,"'Onward' is a magical and heart warming action adventure fantasy. At first, I thought the characters were pretty cliched, but they kinda grew on me as the film progressed. Some characters, like The Manticore, were underdeveloped and their actions were questionable. As for the main characters, Ian and Barley, I rather enjoyed them and their adventures.I could relate to some of the emotional scenes in the film on a personal level. I wasn't actually prepared for that. What happened at the end was touching and meaningful, and I was overcome with a feeling of ""what if..."".Due to slapstick humor in abundance, the film will appeal to a young demographic, but the more serious moments will definitely appeal to adults, as well.

26,cruise01,"Emotional, fun, and plenty of heart",8,6 March 2020,"Onward (4 out of 5 stars).Onward is a good computer animated fantasy film which may not be Pixar's best and memorable film. But it does have heart, emotional filled story, and beautiful animation. Pixar has been going at it with a lot of films. It could have been worse like Cars sequels or Monster University. It may not live up to the top like Toy Story or Incredibles. It was still worth seeing.The plot takes place in a mythical world where magic exists and fantasy creatures like elves, dragons, ect. In the modern times, magic is slowly disappearing when people have depended on technology. A teenage elf Ian (Tom Holland) just turned 16 and his one wish is to meet his father. Which he never had the chance too before he passed away before he was born. His mother Laurel (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) is a caring mother but worries about her boys. His older brother Barley (Chris Pratt) who's a huge fanatic over adventures and magic. Almost looks like he collected every dungeons and dragons cards. Ian is given his father's wizard staff for his birthday with a spell which he can bring his father back for one day only. When the magic goes awry and he only has the bottom half of his father. Barley and Ian plan to go on a quest to find a stone that can finish the spell on bringing their father back.The plot is emotional. It is about a journey of two brothers. There relationship is shaky. Ian is trying to fit in with society and in school but is very awkward. Barley is a magic fanatic. Who believes that magic should never be forgotten. He drives a van called Guinevere with a unicorn painting on it. These two go on an adventure. They meet Corey (Octavia Spencer) a manticore creature. Who owns a restaurant and tries to aid with them. They run into little biker fairies with attitude. That puts them in a bike and van chase on the freeway. The two brothers face against booby traps in the mountains. Trying to find the stone. The conflict challenges them both which they both learn a life lesson. And a theme about life and death. By the time the movie reaches its third act, both of these brothers have learned about this lesson.The animation is beautiful and colorful. It has its fun moments. The film may not be as memorable or the best compared to other films. The music score was not as memorable. The concept was good but it does not stand out like the other movies.The voice talent was good led by Chris Pratt and Tom Holland.Overall, Onward is a good film. It is not the best.

27,eddie_baggins,Lacks the usual Pixar magic,5,29 March 2020,"For a company that is synonymous with magic and wonder, it's a shame a film like Onward feels so un-magical as a Pixar offering.Tha animation kings, have across many decades provided both children and adults with a variety of memorable and fantastical products, products that have transported us to places of unbelievable joy and while on paper Onward seems like the perfect mix of subject matter and master, Dan Scanlan's beautiful too look at but mostly charmless affair tries too hard to pack emotional wallop, while largely ignoring its great set-up on the quest to do so.Set in a universe where genuine magic exists but is largely ignored by a collection of fantasy creatures whose lives have turned more to everyday technology and creations while forgoing the real stuff, Onward quickly bypasses its world and backstory as it turns its focus towards Tom Holland's Ian and Chris Pratt's Barely Lightfoot, brothers who will stop at nothing on their quest to bring back their father from the dead for just one day.Pixar is usually an expert storytelling house when it comes to world building and set-up and Onward just never feels like its allowed time to breath, as it only ever half-explores the raft of ideas or concepts it so easily could've bought into its story, a story that takes a more generic turn of family drama and examination of loss that Pixar seems intent on exploring through efforts such as Coco, Wall-E and Up, films that all managed to create a universe that felt just as important as its more character driven moments.All the elements appear to be in place for Onward to mix together the perfect concoction of heart, soul, laughter and creativity but their all only on show fleetingly throughout the films runtime, an unfortunate facet to a film that's animation work is typically top notch and voice work as solid from a cast of such experienced actors that includes Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Octavia Spencer and Lena Waithe.It's odd to watch a Pixar film, especially in such a bizarre time in our world right now, that has caused Onward to quickly become the biggest financial failure in the history of the company, that doesn't have you belly laughing on regular occurrences or doesn't win you over with its sincerity and well-meaning intent, Onward is like an imposter of the brand, everything is there on surface level, but scratch a little deeper and you can quickly tell this is but a pale imitation of what has come before it, as we begin to tire of this brothers on a mission narrative that perhaps assumed it had us won over early on when in fact we never had a chance to really care.Final Say -Squandering an on paper incredible world to place a story in, Onward's mantra is magic and wonder but losing sight of that very early on to tell a far more generic story, this newest Pixar offering is only a half-formed offering that will likely become one of the most forgettable entries yet into a mostly unforgettable array of films.2 ½ pet dragons out of 5",Onward
28,leonblackwood,"Watchable, but only worth a one-watch! 5/10",5,19 August 2020,"Review:
This is another mediocre movie from Pixar, which had some amusing moments, but it lacked originality. The subject matter seemed to follow a familiar structure, compared to other Pixar movies, so the outcome wasn't that surprising. With that aside, I did enjoy the bonding element between Ian and Barley Lightfoot, and the attention to detail was brilliant, but it's not in the same league as other popular Pixar films. The Avatar looking characters could have easily been normal humans, and the whole Harry Potter wizardry must have confused the younger audience. It seems like Pixar need to come up with new writers and directors because their latest movies lack the grit and wit that we have grown to love in their earlier projects. They have gone down that typical Disney root, by producing safe movies, targeted for a certain age group. They still have the ability to touch our hearts, in terms of the Lightfoot's wanting to speak to there father, which is why I found it quite emotional in places. In all, this movie isn't the worst I have seen from Pixar, but I can't see myself watching it twice. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Dan Scanlon, who also brought you Monsters University, which was a big let down. According to the director, who lost his father at a very young age, this film is inspired by the question he's always asked, ""who was my father?"", which means that it came from the heart. This is the first film that has been released after John Lasseter's departure as CEO of Disney's Animation and judging by the amount it lost at the box office, it's not a good start. I'm sure they will smash the box office once everything goes back to normal, but the anticipation of a Pixar release is slowly withering away.Budget: $175-$200million
Worldwide Gross: $111millionGenre: Animation, Adventure, Comedy, Family, Fantasy,

29,digitalbeachbum,"Fun for the kids, but boring for the cerebral viewer",4,23 March 2020,"First, when you make a trailer, don't put the entire movie in to the trailer. I watched the trailer and they put too much in, giving away all the good scenes.Second, when you write a good adventure story, you have to give the characters a challenge to overcome and you can't let the viewer/reader figure out that they are going to get the quest completed ahead of the story being told.Third, if you are going to have a story like this you have to have a nemesis or bad person to challenge the heroes. The bad person needs to have some overwhelming power that has a weakness and that is where the heroes win.This movie is cute, but that's it, for me at least. It's really boring, and cookie cutter for PIXAR. This is definitely not their best and it definitely is not worth a second viewing by me.

32,southdavid,"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?",6,17 March 2020,"I feel like Disney haven't really provided the support to this film as they have some of their other movies. I wonder if perhaps it's because they didn't have quite as much faith in the actual product this time, which would be fair. It's not awful, but it's not very interesting either and feels rather like a film from another studio, rather than of true Pixar quality.Set in a world where mythical creatures have forgone magic for science, and live in relatively staid 21st century trappings, two brothers, timid Ian (Tom Holland) and older brash Barley (Chris Pratt) live with their mother. On Ian's 16th Birthday, his mother gives him a present from his late father, his magic staff and a spell that will bring him back to life for 24 hours. However, midway through casting the spell, it goes wrong and only his lower half is formed. Ian and Barley (and half their dad) have to quest for a gemstone to complete the spell before the time expires.So, from a technical standpoint, this is as good as any other Pixar film. Solid visuals, lots of background jokes and visual gags. The vocal performances are OK. Tom Holland is using his generic American voice and Chris Pratt with a broader hyper one (that endlessly reminded me of Jack Black). Nobody else form the cast really stands out, either positively or negatively. I did too like the overall message of the film, I'll not spoil it but ""appreciate what you have"" is a good pointer. I enjoyed the ending as well - the last 10/15 minutes have a lot of fun and action to them.However, the rest of the film is a bit .. . flat. I'm not sure that the world is a fully realised as much as it is in something contemporary like ""Zootopia"" and the plot is lacking a good set piece, or firm story beat, or two, before we reach that finale.It's not bad, not by any stretch - and from any of the other animation company it would be OK - but Pixar's history means that they're judged to a higher standard and unfortunately ""Onward"" doesn't quite reach it.",Onward

34,Vartiainen,"Lacks that Pixar magic, ironically enough",6,25 September 2020,"Onward takes places in a world where magic used to be real and even today elves, trolls, unicorns and manticores roam the realm. Except that they have become domesticated and tame. Unmagical. And then a young boy on the cusp of manhood incants a spell in order to spend a day with his late father. Hijinks doth indeed ensue.Like all Pixar movies, Onward is a masterpiece when it comes to the technical side of things. Everything from the animation to the textures to the voice acting is superbly executed. The film looks and sounds fantastic. And I do enjoy the aesthetic the film has going for it. The details are colourful and varied, while also contributing to the occasional chuckle or two. (I'm looking at you, unicorns.)Unfortunately the film falters in execution of its story and world building. This is a world where unicorns roam the land. Where a centaur might become the chief of police. Where pixies form motorcycle gangs. And that all sounds awesome. Until you realize that the film makers didn't bother to give it any thought whatsoever. Everything in this world is plucked straight from ours. They simply replaced humans with fantasy creatures. And that's about as lazy as you can get. For example, that centaur police chief, a dude the size of a horse with the added bulk of a human torso. He drives a completely mundane, human-sized car. He simply squeezes in. And those aforementioned pixie gang members? Instead of having motorcycles made for their size, they drive completely ordinary bikes. It just takes a lot of them to do it.Does that make any sense to you? If you answered no, you're beginning to glimpse my problems with this film.Likewise with the story and the nerdy pop culture references spouted by the two main characters. The film heavily references Dungeons & Dragons, for example. Except that it does it at a very shallow and superficial level. Let me tell you as an actual D&D player and verified lifelong geek, the writers of this movie are not actual geeks. Or if they are, it's not showing. You could have written this film and its geek references after watching a couple seasons of The Big Bang Theory.That being said, the plot has its moments. There is humour to be had. The film is a tad cringy from time to time and I do wish they had represented my chosen fandom with a bit more depth and dignity, but as it is, it's not bad. One of the worse Pixar films I've seen, but that still makes it merely average in terms of overall quality.",Onward

This is Pixar's newest animated movie about two brothers' search for magic in the world. Now, this world is a little different from our world.

41,drqshadow-reviews,This Conceptual Playground Effectively Toys With Some Weighty Subjects,8,7 April 2020,"Cute, conceptually and emotionally rich adventures with a twist, brought to you by the folks who've basically built an industry of such stories. I speak of Team Pixar, of course, which harvests the fruit of high fantasy and pleases all manner of D&D geeks with their latest epic. Onward is about a number of things, from the illusion-crushing indifference of post-industrialization to the stress of graduating into adulthood in a single-parent household, but it's never so heavy as all that. At least, not for very long.For most of its running time, Onward is a loud and loose road trip movie: a pair of essentially different siblings on the run, exploring the wild in search of the past. What shape the past happens to take, that depends upon the individual. Chris Pratt's elder brother, the live-at-home RPG burnout, seeks a taste of the old life, a genuine sense of romantic swords and sorcery in a world that's almost entirely moved on. Tom Holland, the uncertain soon-to-be high school grad, hopes to learn about the father he never met and, maybe, find himself along the way. Did I mention the half-reincarnated, animated lower-half of their dear ol' dad, blindly stumbling along for the ride? Well, that relates to both goals. Pratt and Holland are great together, poking and teasing like brothers often do, while retaining a sense of radiant familial warmth and compassion. Dad's legs, shockingly emotive for what's little more than a pair of slacks, socks and loafers, bring constant comic relief when the scenes threaten to grow too somber.It's a quick, colorful film, proudly weird and effortlessly funny, with a witty sense of meta awareness and an intense personal message at the heart of it all.

The animation is *wonderful* and the overall vibe of a modern fantasy world is great. The main issue is the film wears its influences and cultural references more starkly than other Pixar films. If you play D&D you get a ton of fun out of the obvious parallels present but the film has a slightly more of a Dreamworks (ala Shrek) feel to it.Now this barely matters. The story-two brothers learning to work together as they try to find their father-is pleasant and moving. The film does a good job of hiding the resolution and the take away is not what one would assume from the trailer, early proceedings. Add in that they got the right two actors-Pratt and Holland-and this is a fine film. I re-watched this today and the film is even better on the second viewing in that the brother story lands even harder the second time around.

Seeing characters escape tight situations and end up bettering themselves for it is something that I think is super important for children (and teens) to see- even if they struggle they can do amazing things. This said, the whole film is not a simple cliched flick, the story is engaging (more than many adult-aimed blockbusters I've seen) and while I won't spoil anything, the ending is not what you expect from a children's film- or even most films aimed at adults. It doesn't do what you expect it to all the time, so it keeps feeling new and refreshing. Even if a character doesn't get what they thought they wanted, they learn what they need to. I, for one, am beyond excited to see what Dan Scanlon has in store next, if it's even half as good as Onward is it's gonna be better than most of the movies out there in my eyes. Highly recommended for the whole family, but it does involve aspects of parental death as the wiki will tell you, though more importantly the theme I take away from the film is one of brotherly love- whether you have one or simply wished you had one, if you are hit hard by familial relationships then expect to choke up a little at least!",Onward

The two brothers then had to embark on a grand quest to recover a rare gemstone which could allow Ian to complete the spell, but they only had less than 20 hours to do so, or else they lose the chance to reunite with their father forever.Unlike other Pixar films which were impressively original in content, this one felt like you've seen it before. The suburban community of mythical creatures reminded me of Guillermo del Toro's Netflix animated series ""Trollhunters."" That Ian discovered his wizard abilities on his birthday was rather Harry Potter-ish, as well as his failed initial attempts at casting spells. There was also a bit of ""Frozen"" in the mix as well, as it centered on the relationship between two siblings who never really quite got along well while growing up.Even some aspects fo the artwork, a main Pixar hallmark, felt like you've seen it before. The characters here looked like they were from a Dreamworks film rather than a Disney-Pixar film. In particular, the hefty Barley Lightfoot looked very similar to the character of Snoutlout from ""How to Train Your Dragon"" among other familiar looking characters. They also mined older Pixar films for inspiration. For instance, the character design of the Manticore (Octavia Spencer) I felt looked like a cross between Sully of ""Monsters Inc."" and Lots-o'-Huggin' Bear of ""Toy Story 3.""However, I have to say there were still a lot of proudly Pixar moments, most especially those exhilarating climactic moments as the brothers faced the major curse unleashed by the magic gem. The voice work of Pratt and Holland were perfect for their characters. This film may appeal more to older kids than the very young ones, whom I only heard laughing during those requisite slapstick comedy scenes in films like this. The pacing was rather uneven along the way. However, that final fight showdown and the dramatic family scenes that follow will get your undivided attention and emotional connection.",Onward

51,aidanratesmovies,"Not perfect, but an absolute fun ride",9,6 March 2020,"A fun filled adventure, that is equally enjoyable as it is unique, Pixar's latest animated feature may not be its best work, but it certainly a different change of pace. Tom Holland and Chris Pratt play their parts perfectly in their voice roles as Ian and Barley, and truly encapsulate the joy of being their characters every chance they get. The animation is fantastic as always, and the plot is certainly engaging, and for that matter exciting, even if it proves to get a little messy along the way. The film can be a bit anticlimactic from time to time, which may prove frustrating to some viewers, but by the end, the film will be sure to put a smile on your face, and several times throughout as well. The script is a bt formulaic at times, in addition to it being all over the place, but it feels deeply nostalgic on its own principles, and thus to many is truly a joy to observe. In the end, Onward is by far an entertaining journey from Pixar, that is funny, and certainly unique, with some structural flaws, that if you are able to overcome, will truly make for a wonderful ride.

52,questl-18592,Detentions and Dragons,9,30 March 2021,"My second time watching this and I find myself only liking it more. At this point, the expectations for a Disney/Pixar venture are going to default to high and somehow they always seem to impress. Obviously, animation is gorgeous, it's hilarious, heartfelt and takes place in a magical world. I love this take on a world of magic that evolved out of whimsy for the sake of modern conveniences. The whole idea is fun to me and the film fully delivers on it throughout.Where this one really gets me though is in the relationships. As someone who grew up without a biological father only for someone else to step in and do the job, this film absolutely resonates with me and each time I've watched it the end absolutely wrecks me in the best possible way.I feel like this one will continue to grow on me the more I watch it but for right now the only thing keeping it from the absolute tippy top of the Pixar list, sports reserved by the likes of Wall-E and The Incredibles and Toy Story is a consistent throughline of wonderment. There are a couple of slow moments, they're relevant but at this point I'm nitpicking.Onward is a phenomenal, heartfelt film. As much of a heartwarming as it is hilarious and whimsical. Absolutely recommend watching this. Seek it out, subscribe to Disney+, buy the disc, whatever you have to do. It's well worth it.",Onward

55,davidmvining,"Wonderful visuals, conflicting themes, and a strong core story",7,21 April 2020,"Pixar's fantasy adventure actually has two themes running through it, and they're pretty contradictory. Which I find interesting. On the one hand you have the story of a teenager discovering that what's important is what's in front of him. On the other you have the story of a world trying to reclaim what its lost. Up until the final moments, the two seem to be heading to similar places, but then they diverge rather quickly.From what I've read, the story of two brothers trying to reconstitute their dead father was always the story, it just changed through development. At first, it was a more science-like story with Frankenstein overtones as the two tried to rebuild the dead father from parts, but they abandoned it for an idea they had of a fantasy world gone modern. I just don't think they quite reconciled the core story that was always there with the details of the world that they populated around it.So, Ian and Barley are the brothers and Ian turns sixteen. Their mother hands them a present from their father, which he had dictated should be given once both had reached sixteen. It's a wizard's staff, a remnant of the world's past when magic was ever-present, since abandoned because of the relative ease of technology versus the execution of magic. Along with the staff is a spell to bring their dad back for a single day, a powerful spell that Ian loses control of halfway through, conjuring their father from the waist down. So begins the quest to find another MacGuffin so that Ian can complete the spell and visit with their dad.The story gets really bogged down in the details of the world, though, for first half or so. When I started this review by saying there are two contradictory themes going on, I didn't only mean their messages, but the two actually end up feeling like separate stories going on at the same time. This difference is probably most apparent when Ian, Barley, and their dad's legs come across a biker gang of fairies. It doesn't help that the biker gang toss up is a pretty cliched element of road pictures, but the fairies end up personifying this other theme almost exclusively. You see, the fairies, at some point between the invention of the lightbulb and that day, had collectively lost the ability to fly. A shrunken Barley, after a mishap of magic at the hands of Ian, goes on about how fairies should fly like in the olden days, days he wishes he could have lived in himself. Long after the fairies part ways with the brothers, they show up flying, having re-embraced flying, that which they had lost. This gets manifested in a couple of other ways, mostly with the Manticore, the winged creature that points Ian and Barley to the MacGuffin at her inn, and it's a fine idea. However, it ends up contradicting the emotional journey that Ian goes through.Ian and Barley follow the model of Barley's Dungeons and Dragons inspired game (which, in this world, is based on history and fact) and find the Manticore. She no longer guides people on quests but manages her family themed restaurant of an inn. How she could have led people on quests in this world at any point in her life raises questions about timelines that the movie isn't interested in addressing because it's honestly not that important, but the questions still get raised. (Is she hundreds of years old? Did the world turn modern really quickly? If so, then how is magic treated like ancient history at the same time?) She guides them to Raven's Point which is a series of large raven statues leading them to the MacGuffin's location.What matters is less the specifics of the quest and more the budding relationship of the two brothers, and this is where the movie shines. Ian starts the movie embarrassed by Barley, who is several years older and seems to have no prospects beyond the confines of his gaming board, but the quest thrusts them together on the road in Barley's old van. Ian grows to appreciate Barley's virtues, including the virtues of his game (based on history) that teaches Ian spells and a new way to look at the world through history. The ultimate lesson that Ian learns, when time has run out and there's only a few seconds left for their father to appear, is that while Ian may never have known their dad, Barley did, and Barley never got to say goodbye. Ian learns to let go of the past he never knew in order to give Barley closure on the past that he did know. This is exactly the opposite of the other theme in the movie of the fairies learning to fly like their ancestors did.The movie's messy, especially in its first half, but the core of the movie works really well. Ian learning the value of Barley is wonderful. The fact that we are seeing the events through Ian's eyes and we never see his dad up close is great. I love that it maintains that perspective discipline while being able to deliver an emotionally satisfying denouement at the same time. I also really like the look of the world, providing the mix of old and new in convincing ways from the ruined fountain outside the modern school to the new visual take on a dragon at the end. There's so much to like in this film, but I just wish it had more narrative discipline.",Onward
56,jadepietro,On the Road Again,7,10 March 2020,"GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Despite some lovely animation, this road comedy needs some retooling.JIM'S REVIEW: It is what it is. Animators usually wow us with the visuals and underwhelm us with their storytelling. It is so rare that an animated film melds both of these elements in its 90 minute format without resorting to a climactic car chase or action sequence. The state of the arts wizardry is firmly on display while the plot and characters recede into the background.For years, Pixar has been at the forefront in creating superior entertainment that not only satisfy but impress both adults and children with their message. One only has to look to some of the studio's work to see masterful films that restore one's faith in animation and its unlimited possibilities. To name just a few of their great movies: Up, Finding Nemo, the underrated Ratatouille, The Incredibles, the Toy Story series, all of which successfully conjure up that special magic. (Other slightly uneven films like Monsters, Inc., Coco, Inside Out, Wall-E, and A Bug's Life still have much to admire while there have been lesser efforts from the studio as well such as the Cars series, Brave, and The Good Dinosaur.) One would hope a film about magic would have that vital component. Their latest effort, Onward, does not.Directed by Dan Scanlon and written by the team of Keith Bunin, Jason Headley & also Mr. Scanlon, this road comedy falls into the latter category, as it suffers the same fate as most animated features nowadays which I will called DSF (Dreaded Screenplay Fatigue).The plot: One evening, two elf brothers, Barley and Iandore ""Ian"" Lightfoot, try to resurrect the spirit of their dead father with the help of a magical staff. Unfortunately, the spell only works partially, creating their dad's lower half. To rectify their error, the two must go on a quest to find a gemstone that will undo their spell. This computer-generated fantasy leads them to many odd characters and dangerous situations to right a wrong.The sight gags and visual puns come frequently although the end result is rather bland family entertainment that certainly does not register on the same level as Pixar's other quality products. The main issue is a screenplay lacking wit and cohesive storytelling.This aforementioned script is sloppy storytelling in need of major rewrites. It doesn't clarify major details to the plot too well. As Ian and Barley travel on their confusing journey from one detour to the next, they quickly hint at the rules of the game, shouting out exposition mere moments before the action occurs. It is essential information that is direly missing for moviegoers who have no prior knowledge of the goings-on, the complications of the situations, and the ultimate road to the McGuffin. Except for the main characters, the other supporting characters need better development and rarely rise to an interesting level. They simply interrupt the action rather than advance it.Still there is much to admire. Tom Holland and Chris Pratt do a terrific job of voiceovers, bringing much energy and fun to these lively brothers. Their vocal intonations successfully capture the characters' diverse personality traits and make them endearing to the audience. Adding to that, the visual artistry is still impressive as one expects from the studio's talented artisans: colorfully detailed backgrounds, wondrous textures with hair, fur, fire, and water, expressive and lovable characters.But all of the artistic wizardry cannot hide a story has little substance that is essentially a road buddy movie with much action and very little serious emotional content. The movie tries in its final moments to touch the heart but fails. Nice try, though.Onward doesn't go forward enough in the annals of computer-generated animation. This buddy movie fantasy remains diverting but hardly memorable. Kids should enjoy the quirkiness and slapstick silliness, adults...just sit back and lower your expectations a bit. It's all part of your parental duty.",Onward

58,rgkarim,"Onward To Fun, Family Friendly Adventure",8,6 March 2020,"The Verdict:Disney has another winner on their hands with this film, as Onward sets out to be the same magic of fun, laughs, and family energy this studio is famous for. Adventures likes this, combined with the great animation, will open up a new avenue to getting to your heart, and this time geared for both cool people and geeks. Onward has much to offer for many people, and I love the fact the lessons are baked naturally into the theme of the movie, without being too preachy or political. Certainly the film needed to work on the predictability, but more so the film struggles to still not pull the full spirit of adventure that comes with Fantasy films. In addition, several other characters could have stand for more integration to round out the tales, add more levels of story, and of course just have more opportunity for grabbing more people into the movie. This reviewer though really found joyful to watch, and I'd recommend checking this out in the theaters if you have the time.My scores are:

59,rannynm,"Easily one of my favorite Pixar films. Touching story, beautiful world building",10,8 May 2020,"As of now, this film is easily one of my favorite Pixar films. I adore the touching story and especially the world building. Overall, Onward is an amazing film.Onward takes in a world much like our own, except it's populated with fantasy creatures. We follow two elf brothers, Ian and Barley Lightfoot as they discover magic still exists and thus go on a quest to revive their father for one day.So, first the animation. I feel like this is pretty self-explanatory. Since it is Pixar, the animation is absolutely outstanding. But, I specifically want to discuss the world in which Onward takes place. There are so many creative and diverse character designs and representations of mythological creatures (which I appreciate as a mythology fan). The world building is probably some of the best I've ever seen. I have contemplated the idea of a suburban fantasy, so I'm really happy seeing that idea brought to life. There's a lot of really funny gags surrounding this idea, such as an historically accurate ""Dungeons and Dragons"" and unicorns becoming the equivalent of raccoons. You can tell the artists really enjoyed designing the settings.However, the world is not the only enjoyable aspect of this film. The characters are especially fun. The two brothers, Ian and Barley, have amazing chemistry. This is probably thanks to their voice actors - Tom Holland playing Ian and Chris Pratt playing Barley. They already have a connection from the Marvel movies, so their relationship feels real. But Ian and Barley aren't the only great characters in this movie. I would say my personal favorite character is The Manticore, played by Octavia Spencer. The Manticore is probably the funniest character and I really like her friendship with the brothers' mom, Laurel (Julia Louis-Dreyfus).Speaking of which, Onward is really funny. There's a specific scene involving The Manticore that caused me to laugh probably the hardest I've ever laughed at a Pixar movie. There are also a lot of gags involving the fact that the world is populated with fantasy creatures.And as expected from a Pixar film, it's pretty emotional. And, given the context of the plot, I feel this might be one of Pixar's most heart wrenching films. When you think about it, who wouldn't want to bring someone back, even for one day?I give this film 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 7 to 18. Reviewed by Calista B., KIDS FIRST!

Now, 30 seconds in, when I saw the Cyclops people, my expectations lowered some more, but pretty much everything past that was a positive experience.It's a little stylized in a goofy manner, but they have quality actors, production and execution.My biggest problem is that one of the characters is a pair of legs.

The film starts with a lot of world building, as we see how society evolves as new technologies are invented. I was curious to see where the story is going to go and how it would make use of this world that they'd built. Sadly I don't think it took full advantage of the possibilities available; and there are also a few plotholes I noticed. The problem for me is that while we're watching Ian and Barley navigate their quest (along with their dad's legs) I never became emotionally attached to any of the characters for the payoff at the end to have any sort of meaningful impact on me. I understand logically why the ending is meant to be sweet, but, unlike most Pixar features, it fails to hit me in the feels.
The voice acting is fantastic, Tom Holland and Chris Pratt seem to have striking chemistry as brothers. They play characters with totally opposite personalities, but the brotherly bond is absolutely clear. The other technical values remain in the background, complementing the narrative well.
On the whole, Onward, sadly, is not on par with other Pixar's A-listers, but it's still well-done movie that's fun to watch.",Onward

The way they've used a mixture of real life elements and fantasy elements from Dungeons and Dragons universe is also great and worth mentioning.

68,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,"Entertaining, but not great PIXAR storytelling.",7,29 April 2020,"Onward is a nicely done if somewhat predictable offering from Disney: it's got the hallmarks of Pixar's Toy Story films' buddy-comedy dynamic going on, but it tries to go for heart-melting emotion like Up and it doesn't quite get there in the end. It's even got splashes of Disney's A Goofy Movie (though they're very broad connections, the road-trio trope being one of them).It's typical family fare that's going to be a lot of kids' all-time favourite movie for a while, but me: I think it's a visually gorgeous movie that has familiar traits from the studio's previous outings in cinema. Compared to PIXAR's other movies, Onward is more a remix movie that rehashes a lot of fantasy cinema's cliches while making the central themes being brotherhood and fatherhood. And the film actually does show how important one's upbringing can really be.If you're looking for something mind-blowingly amazing, think again (though you just might find it great anyway).

The film itself had nothing specifically wrong with it if anything the best part is the animation is fantastic for me though whilst the story had its moments there were long stretches I felt completely bored and didn't reach the magical heights we know Disney can. In general it did keep my attention and in parts it was fun it just didn't have a constant flow of any specific memorable magical moments I could look back on and say wow that was great.

71,blott2319-1,"Surprisingly enjoyable, just ignore those lackluster trailers",8,13 April 2020,"Despite what others have said, I've always found Pixar's work as hit-and-miss as any other studio. As a result, I simply never felt the urge to see Onward because the trailers made it seem like another lackluster effort on their part. But there is a lot to like in this film, so I'm glad Disney added it to their streaming service, because I might have missed it otherwise. I was a bit worried early on that the entire film was going to be one of those animated kids' movies that utilizes the same trope in order to create all the humor in the film. Much like Cars hinges all its humor on the fact that cars are doing human things, I thought Onward was going to be one long series of magical creatures doing modern human things. It came close, and there were certainly aspects of this film that dragged a bit for me because that kind of shorthand comedy gets lazy and less funny, particularly the more they rely on it. The Manticore's tavern being turned into a Chuck E. Cheese is pretty funny, but by the time they get to biker-gang sprites I'm not even chuckling. Thankfully, there were other elements of humor in the movie that kept me laughing, and this movie isn't all about the jokes.What worked so well in Onward was the way it handled the other tropes of adventure stories like this one. There were a ton of times when I expected the film to go one way, and it went the unexpected route. It would have been so easy to just make a knock-off kids' version of an Indiana Jones movie, but they made some different choices. It's as if the screenwriters were heeding the advice of Barley that ""The clear path is never the right one."" There are moments that are predictable in the film, and they do a decent job of setup and payoff with some plot points, but I never felt it was rote. Even the patented Pixar tearjerker moment wasn't what you'd expect based on the movie up to that point, which I thought made it even more effective. The emotional heart of the story is what makes Onward special, and that is why I will watch it again. Finally, I have heard some complaints about the voice cast, but I think they all do a great job. Yes, I would not have minded if Chris Pratt made his voice a little less recognizable, but it wasn't so distracting that I was taken out of the movie. I'm happy to say, Onward is a film I can see myself recommending as an unexpected gem in the Pixar filmography.",Onward

74,rockman182,Onward (2020),7,7 March 2020,"Its always something special when a new Pixar film comes out. For the most part Pixar has released films of the utmost quality. Efforts like The Toy Story films, Inside Outt, and Coco are all fabulous. I didn't know what to make of the trailer for Onward but it had that unique feel to it that only Pixar studios is capable of. So, how is the film? I'd say overall, its an interesting and original concept but it doesn't always keep the viewer interested. It's still a good addition to the Pixar legacy.
The film is the story of two brothers in a world where magic has been fading in the world. They find out that their late father leave them a magical staff and a phoenix gem with a spell that will bring their father back for one day. However, they are only able to conjure the bottom half of their father. They both go on a magical quest to find another phoenix gem to complete the spell and bring their father back for a limited time. The two leads are voiced by Tom Holland and Chris Pratt.
The animation and music in this is stellar as you know it should be from a Pixar film. The characters are fun, especially Pratt's geeky older deadbeat brother role. I just felt like the film tries to capture a lot of the emotion that previous films have done but does not do it as well. It just didn't connect with me in that regard. I appreciate the plot of the film and the uniqueness of this wild journey that these two embark on but its not always greatly entertaining and I felt myself checking the clock.
The real key of the film is the wonderful animation on display on absolutely every frame. Its a non stop adventure for sure although not all of it is as fun as it probably could be. Pixar has made films that I like less than Onward. Onward has its moments but is a kind of middle of the road feature for a studio that has put out better quality efforts.

The other reason I will always go to see a Pixar movie is their dedication to a good story. Sure, there have been some missed steps over the years (The Good Dinosaur (2015) being the latest example), but their track record has been good enough to warrant me seeing their films in the theater. While I was looking forward to this year's offering of Onward (2020), the result felt a little lackluster overall.Choosing to explore a storyline with a deceased parent was odd in that it felt like something that had rarely been addressed in movies geared toward children while also having a strong ""after school special"" vibe to it. Either way, putting it in a pseudo-Monsters, Inc. (2001) fantasy world was a fun way to deliver this tale of two brothers on a road trip to find a way to bring their father back for a single day. I laughed out loud at the freeze-frame jokes that I picked up on (my favorite being the ""Mountain Doom"" soda can), and I'm sure I'll have to pause it a bunch of times if I pick it up to own at some point.While the ""coming of age"" story felt a little weak overall-having been done a ton elsewhere-the emotional impact of the last 10-15 minutes had me ugly crying in the way that Pixar films always do. I liked the climax of this film, but there were times where I thought the focus of the action completely forgot about the father's legs (which themselves were the source of plenty of superb visual gags). Is this Pixar's best film? Probably not. Is it better than the other CGI animation out there? Most definitely.A somewhat standard coming of age story with Pixar's usual charm, I give Onward 3.5 stars out of 5.",Onward
76,RforFilm,"Onward understands the emotional core and character arc, but could have used a lot more magic in this fantasy story",6,11 March 2020,"Dungeon master; move forth into the cave and look for a locked treasure. Be on the lookout for a large dragon. Be sure the mage is equipped with the proper spells. This is one such instruction you might hear if you were playing a tabletop role playing game like Dungeons & Dragons. These games have given players of all ages a way to become a fantasy character within a world of quests, sorcery and medieval warfare. It's unsurprising that this would not only draw from classic fantasy, but itself has inspired future fantasy writers. So what happens when fantasy becomes reality?Wouldn't be great to be able to drop everything and go on a magical quest like the ones you'd find in Dungeons & Dragons? In todays story, we have an interesting scenario where the ones undertaking the quest...are fantasy characters who have forgotten about magic. I really appreciate artists that attempt something unique about the fantasy setting and don't feel that they have to be within a medieval timeframe. Some can have a modern setting. Some can even have modern attributes like computers, cars and weapons. Lets see how Pixar goes forth in Onward.In a world of fantasy and mythical creatures, magic is all but forgotten. In fact, this is a world where everything is modernized. There are suburban neighborhoods, schools that kids go to, restaurants where people eat, and most importantly, technology. Elves, minotaurs, goblins, and more have all used technology to steer more towards where humanity is today. If there's anyone here who still pines for the world of magic and classic quests is teenager Barley Lightfoot (played by Chris Pratt) who lives his fantasies through his table top games which is consisted historical content. He also tries to be a good bug brother for Ian (played by Tom Holland) and son for widowed mother Laurel (played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus).It also happens to be Ian's sixteenth birthday who badly wants to reinvent himself from his dweeby personality. He lacks the confidence and wishes he could ask his dad. But his father died before he was born and knows little about him. His mother gives him a gift that turns out to be his dad's old magic staff, including a spell that can bring him back for one day. Though the spell works, it only brings his bottom legs. Barley encourages Ian to go on a quest to bring the rest of their dad back before time runs out.I'd say that Onward has an odd problem that I haven't seen from Disney since Treasure Planet; it understands the character arc and journey, but has a hard time with the rest. Does that make the movie bad? No, but it makes it kind of forgettable. To start on the good stuff, the story about these two brothers wanting to see their dad one last time is very nice. Even the ending, which I wont spoil, really makes you think of what the journey was really about.To also add on to that, both Chris Pratt and Tom Holland do a good job playing a believable set of brothers who seem to fill in empty parts of themselves. I'd believe Ian would see Barley as a father figure. I'd believe Barley would be unashamed at embarrassing him younger brother. I even like their relationship with their mother and their acceptance of her new boyfriend cop.So if it has the important stuff down, then what's wrong with the movie? It's the setting. Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of taking fantasy elements and putting it in a modern timeframe. But the setting needed more fantasy and less human. Much of what we see is so much like our real lives, it could have been swapped for humans and the real world and nothing would have been changed. Even the fantasy world it started out as seems like your standard fantasy world we've seen in Lord of the Rings, The Legend of Zelda, Dungeons & Dragons, etc... It probably would have been more effective to keep the fantasy world a total mystery, or maybe have it told from the perspective of Barley. If the fantasy element doesn't bother you, you'll probably like this fine.I'll give this six magical staffs out of ten. I think I liked it more then a lot of people did, but it's also no where near the same level of storytelling that Toy Story, Up, and Coco were. It's an enjoyable movie from Disney. But whether its just as magical will depend on what your looking for.",Onward
77,Hollywood_Yoda,Good pace and Writing,10,7 April 2020,"Usually, the newest Disney/Pixar film has a lot of hype and big weekends at the box office. Disney+ released the film on their platform on April 3, and my family watched. The film was wonderfully written with an even pace to the story and the voice acting wasn't bad.However, I do think that Jack Black would have been a much better choice to voice the elder elven brother. It would have been a fantastic fit for his voice. I did like that Julia Louis-Dreyfus voices the mother, I could barely tell it was her.Can't wait for the Blu-ray release, this was a very awesome movie!!",Onward

Ian & Barley set out on an adventure to find out if magic still exists, in their commercialized fantasy world.Onward is a fantastic film. Director Dan Scanlon has given us yet another Disney-Pixar movie, that makes you laugh, has amazing adventure set pieces, tugs at your heartstrings and even makes you tear up, a couple of times. The animation is breathtaking. The 3D is perfectly immersive. The vocal performances are the highlight of the film. Tom Holland is spectacular as Ian Lightfoot. Chris Pratt is outstanding as Barley Lightfoot. Holland & Pratt share this heartwarming & effortless camaraderie together & they carry the movie. Julia Louis-Dreyfus is brilliant as Laurel Lightfoot. Octavia Spencer is excellent as The Manticore. Mel Rodriguez is great as Colt Bronco. The supporting cast is good. Onward is a must watch, with your entire family.

79,Animany94,Casually enjoyable with its heart in the right place.,7,12 March 2020,"Onward is the first offering from Pixar in 2020 and might have been for the best, because while it gives us a heartfelt story that will make the watch worthwhile, it's weak in other places.To begin with, the animation is surprisingly unoriginal in the design of the world. It mostly consists of normal suburban settings with just a little change to buildings which has been seen many times before and character designs looking like modern smurfs very often. But the effects of the magic is still strong to make the core of the world and the fight scenes engaging.And the acting is what brings these pretty generic characters to life, because their characterizations alone aren't very strong. Sympathetic, yes, but that's due to the goals they have and the performances by their respective actor: writing and acting.The best character has to be the boys' dad, because of how much personality made out of his silent and unique character. I did expect Chris Pratt to be over-the-top, so I wasn't that annoyed by him and he reveals likable sides of him when he and Tom Holland's role, Ian, bond over the course of the movie.The overall story may be predictable, but its immense heart makes it all worthwhile.A 7/10 from me.",Onward

82,mitsubishizero,Hits you in the feels,8,4 February 2021,"It's a shame the younger brother never got to meet his dad but nitpick aside, I liked this movie. Definitely one of Pixar's more mature films. Tom Holland and Chris Pratt work well off each other in their journey to get the top half of their dad who was revived from a spell.From here on out, they get into all sorts of misadventures throughout their trip. Along the way, they grow closer. If this sounds familiar, it's because in some ways it is. However, it does offer a few twists; mainly their relationship and their goal. The dialogue's pretty good. Their chemistry is believable.The animation's great as always. I really liked the fight scene towards the end. And the story was also well done. While you've probably seen this before, Pixar does add an original twist or two to it making it still its own thing.Onward is another gem in Disney/Pixar's library. Another film for all to enjoy. This'll definitely hit you in the feels. With that being said, check it out.",Onward
83,brookenichole-98054,Pretty good,7,4 April 2020,Onward is not terrible. It's actually very cute. The message of the story touched my heart and the story was not too bad.

I would still watch this because it was entertaining and will make you smile.,Onward
84,vampire_hounddog,"""Put it on O for Onward!""",7,4 September 2020,"In a magical fantasy suburb, two rival siblings (voiced by Tom Holland and Chris Pratt) have dealt with the death of their father in different ways while growing up. When the youngest brother (Holland) gets hold of a magic staff he is able to bring back his father for 24 hours only. The spell doesn't entirely work and he only comes back from the waist down. To bring back the rest, the two brothers go on a quest to retrieve a magic stone.The Disney-Pixar teaming once again hits the mark with this fantasy adventure that makes irreverent humour out of fairy-tales which in part had made the SHREK films such a success. Once again it is another strong tale about loss and longing for a parent that has been such a mainstay throughout the history of Disney films that is the driver of the story.",Onward
85,kjproulx,Effectively Emotional and Fun,9,1 March 2020,"Back in the 90s, I absolutely loved the Toy Story films and I've been able to see almost every Pixar film in theatres since then. Even sitting through cash grabs like Cars 2, I knew there would always be originality from them on the horizon. From Monsters Inc. to Coco, this is a company that knows how to tug at your heartstrings in all the right ways, working nearly every time in my opinion. Onward in their latest theatrical release and I believe they've done it again. Although I wouldn't put it in the conversation of being one of their top five movies, that's also a very difficult list to crack, so I'll just have to settle with calling this one great instead of amazing. Oh, what a pain.Onward follows Ian and Barley Lightfoot, two brothers who lost their father. Barley being the eldest has a few memories with him, but Ian was never able to spend time with him, as he passed away before he was born. This film takes place in a world like our own, but it's inhabited by mythical creatures. Magic does exist, but it has been long forgotten about. On Ian's 16th birthday, his mother gifts him a staff that his father left behind for him. Along with the staff is a list of spells, one of which will allow them to bring their father back for 24 hours. Accidentally only bringing back his legs, they venture on a quest to find a gem that will be able to bring the rest of him back.This is a story that has been done many times in different ways, so you may find the ending slightly predictable, but how they showcase the climactic events actually surprised and impressed me. Nothing really went exactly how I thought it would, but it was all very effective, fun, and incredibly emotional. If for nothing else, I praise this film for winning me over on multiple occasions. I found myself latching onto these two brothers and I was in tears by the final act. As I said, Pixar knows how to tug at your heartstrings, but it is usually always earned, and Onward is no exception.Director and co-writer Dan Scanlon is really the reason this film exists in the first place. His actual father in real life passed away when he was very young and he has no memory of him. This fact actually made me like the film even more, because it really did feel like it was coming from a real place. The way this film wraps up, even with the mythological aspects at play, felt very real and was shown as if what they were doing was actually possible. I found how everything played out to be incredibly moving.Overall, Onward may not be one of Pixar's very best movies, but it's still a great, moving film that I will probably recommend as one of the better movies of 2020 later in the year. Chris Pratt and Tom Holland are very enjoyable as the voice leads and the animation is stellar as always. It almost seems pointless to talk about how great the visuals are in these movies when reviewing it because you just know Disney won't release anything that isn't top-notch in terms of animation. Onward is a film that is aimed at a younger audience, but it really is an adult story through and through. I might not be able to call it amazing or refer to it as a masterpiece, but I'd be lying to myself if I didn't say that I absolutely loved watching it. This one gets a big recommendation from me.",Onward

87,msbreviews,"Onward might not be Pixar's greatest film yet, but it still packs that emotional punch.",8,2 March 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I always struggle to find reasons to dislike a Pixar film. One of the most annoying preconceived notions about genres is the one about animated movies. ""They're for children, how can you enjoy stuff like that, you're so childish"", people say. Little do they know that animated flicks have as much or more emotionally compelling narratives and characters than live-action films. The score is usually more important in the former genre, and the visuals always look stunning. The partnership Disney-Pixar is probably the best thing that could have happened to Hollywood.Dan Scanlon delivered a surprisingly good sequel to Monsters Inc. back in 2013 with Monsters University. Making an efficient sequel twelve years after its original is a challenging task, and Scanlon succeed, so I had good expectations going in. Onward might not be one of Pixar's best movies, and I doubt that a lot of people will place it as one of their favorites when comparing with the studio's films of the same type. However, it still carries the trademark emotional narrative with relatable characters that Pixar always delivers.I grew up with a father, mother, and two older brothers. Just with this information, I know that I'm luckier than a whole bunch of people all around the world. Onward focuses on the relationship between two siblings (Chris Pratt and Tom Holland), and I love their adventure together. It made me recall my childhood and the awesome moments I shared with my brothers. If you're a fan of Dungeons & Dragons or other quest-based games, the main plot's structure will definitely please you as it did me, but it's connected to my biggest gripe...The concept is pretty neat, but its execution lacks a little bit of more... magic, as ironic as it might be. For example, Frozen II isn't about a ""world full of magic"", but Elsa (Idina Menzel) alone has more magical scenes than Onward in its entirety. In the former, the actual magic feels the screen with stunning animation and chill-inducing music. Onward feels like a diminished version of its true potential. While it's true that the world where the main characters live in has lost its overwhelming magic from the past, their adventure is filled with obstacles which they deal with... you guessed it, magic.I don't want to sound like that guy who only wants ""action for the sake of action"". I hate when people dislike a movie simply because they didn't see enough stuff exploding or something. It's a bit about expectations and about what I know Pixar can do. Obviously, I'm expecting more from them now more than ever. It's not that the story isn't interesting or captivating because there's definitely an entertaining vibe throughout the whole runtime. It's well-paced, there's always something going on, and the humor is pitch-perfect. It's GOOD. Simple as that.The voice acting is fantastic. Tom Holland and especially Chris Pratt really incorporate their characters' spirit, and it's almost palpable that the actors had tons of fun behind-the-scenes. Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Octavia Spencer are also quite good, but their characters' respective arcs aren't near as compelling as the primary narrative. Every moment I spent with them is every moment I wanted to go back to the brothers. However, the fun and entertainment never go away. The story never fails to be exciting, it just goes increases and decreases its level ever so slightly.I saved the best for last. Even though the second act feels a tad repetitive, the ending is incredibly satisfying. Predictable? Yes. Will it be underwhelming/disappointing for some people? Surely. But it delivers the most beautiful of messages in the most emotional way possible, as Pixar always manages to do. A lot of nice, small morals are learned throughout the story, but the final one is absolutely perfect, and it left some tears in my eyes. The ending is heartfelt and genuine for everyone, but it will have a tremendous impact on families that lost a member way too soon.All in all, the Disney-Pixar's partnership continues to provide the world with the best animated films of each year. Onward is the most recent success, even though it lacks a bit of magic and creativity when compared to the studio's movies of the same genre. Boasting a talented voice cast, the two brothers go on a fun, quest-based adventure that concludes with a wonderful, heartfelt message to every family out there. Some people might find the ending too predictable and underwhelming, but the climax is emotionally powerful, and it will unquestionably cause an impact on everyone (tissues, anyone?). Its second act feels a bit repetitive, but the entertainment never fades away. Hilarious and clever humor, compelling main characters, not-that-interesting secondary characters, and gorgeous animation as always. The end credits song is pretty cool too. Can't wait for Soul...",Onward

89,SoumikBanerjee25,Once Again Pixar Does Deliver Its Message.,7,22 April 2020,"I am a huge fan of Animated Movies, Specifically those which come from Pixar studios. 'Inside Out' is probably my most favorite animated movie ever! Having said that I always eagerly look forward to any Pixar release. Sometimes they stand up to my usual expectency other times not so much. Unfortunately this time it's not something I would remember for long but still it's a well made outcome per se.The storyline is simple, it's about two brother's journey into a magical quest. That are sure to delight you with its mesmerizing photo realistic animation and gripping voice acts. Tom Holland as Ian the younger brother and Chris Pratt as Barley the elder brother just matched up so damn well. The character arcs are well done on those two leads but that's not the same case for the others though. As the others lacked that spark big time, unlike a regular Pixar character who usually does have that. I have complaints in the Screenplay section too. As I think, there weren't many creative decisions taken into consideration when animating some specific scenes. By Pixar's level, that was pretty ordinary and underwhelming to say the least.But as always, Pixar does it once again with the message. The underlying lessons are beautifully crafted and taught through in a simplified manner. Everyone should learn something from it. For those who still couldn't get it; In short it teaches us Two Main Things.#1 How we, as human beings are so invested in modern technologies that We almost forgot about our ancestors' achievements and the importance of the Historical milestones they set. We have now become so ignorant about our Rich culture and Traditions that we don't even have the sufficient courage to wake our true potentials. We never understand how much capable we are as a species because of the Laziness we endured for so long now.&#2 We sometimes blatantly ignore the people who are always there to support us in every need. We rather put our hopes to someone we never had nor will ever have. But never to them who were always there by our side; no matter what the circumstances! It's about acknowledging what we currently have and emphasizes on the true value of them. We should move on from the past and look ""Onward"".These two foreshadowed morals made the film convincing for me. It sure brought some tears to my eyes.Overall it's a pretty good movie, that can be enjoyed by everyone. Though it's not on the same level as the other Pixar Classics but Surely it is a delightful watch nonetheless.",Onward

91,mfellipecampos,Good,7,6 March 2020,"It's nothing new: you can find different types of personal and family messages in each Pixar animation. Viva - A Vida é uma Festa is the studio's most recent film that takes a deep look at grief and the different ways of facing death. But what is truly interesting in films like Viva or, in a milder case, Dois Irmãos, is not the choice of addressing such themes in themselves; rather, the way they are deepened as animation and, theoretically, in stories ""made for children"". The truth is that for a long time (or, perhaps, since Toy Story) such works have spoken to the generation of adults in a deeper way, hidden enough that children do not capture - at least while they are still children. Addressing serious psychological issues in Fun, for example, is a good reminder that there is much to be analyzed and reflected on.Dois Irmãos, the second animated feature directed by Dan Scanlon, certainly does not have such a moving story in terms of mourning in the same way as Viva, but this is only because the focus of the animation is more cheerful and focused on the vigor of the main character duo, brothers Ian and Barley Lightfoot. The original title itself says it all: the word onward means ""forward"", different from the revisit to the past that animation inspired by Mexican culture brings. But of course, this does not mean that Dois Irmãos is not able to thrill; after all, the magical universe created especially for this story brings the well-known care to the smallest details and a beautiful arrangement of visual and thematic composition. Such care facilitates immersion without delay, no matter how early we see a world full of witches, elves and dragons.In addition to being well connected with secondary issues, but which also matter in the complete set, the universe of Dois Irmãos is captivating. In fact, the creative choice to talk about games of magic, whether on boards or cards, brings a mixture of nostalgia with a feeling that this was still uncharted territory until then. In fact, no animation from the studio has ever addressed this type of entertainment - let alone having the feat of including strictly familiar points at key moments. The balance between comedy and drama is well balanced, which includes giving more space to the pleasant atmosphere during the brothers' mission than to the real reason for both of them being on that journey.And it is when the Lightfoot father figure appears that the reminder arises that this is not just another simple story of adventure between brothers who start to finally strengthen their ties. Emphasizing the intention of simultaneously amusing and raising awareness, there is the presence of only a part of the father's body. His presence does not make him able to speak to his children, but it is still extremely essential for the storytelling. The most dramatic pauses take place to highlight the true message: look to the side and value what you have. Not what you had or will still have, but what you have right now.Dois Irmãos does not take the easy path and builds, unhurriedly, stone by stone, its true intention towards the spectator. History makes us follow an alternative route with holes, doubts, climbs and sacrifices. Once again, Pixar knows how to make seemingly childish animations directly approach personal situations, which can surprise viewers by resembling reality so much - or, at least, making them reflect.As in a multi-level game, the animation gives space for alternative missions to go at the same pace as the main mission. The script intersperses questions about the ability of individuals to use their magic or not (which can be translated into the real world into something like using their own voice) and getting in touch with their own selves. Meanwhile, he also talks about the weight a family relationship has - whether it exists with his parents and siblings or with just one of them. The words ""pay more attention"" echo throughout the narrative and are worked in an uncomplicated and true way in this animation, which, for children, only has a kind of colored armor.",Onward

94,MrDHWong,A wonderful continuation of that unique Pixar charm that never stops being fun,9,14 May 2020,"Onward is a CGI fantasy film created by PIXAR. Featuring the voices of Tom Holland and Chris Pratt in the lead roles, it is a wonderful continuation of that unique Pixar charm that never stops being fun.In a fantasy world populated with mythical beings, elven high schooler Ian Lightfoot (voiced by Tom Holland) lives with his older brother Barley (voiced by Chris Pratt) and their widowed mother Laurel (voiced by Julia Louis-Dreyfus) in the town of Mushroomton. On Ian's sixteenth birthday, he and Barley receive a gift from their deceased father Wilden containing a magical staff, a powerful gem, and a spell that will allow the brothers to bring their father back to life for just one day only. Later that night, Ian accidentally recites the spell to himself which results in his father's bottom half materialising in front of him and the gem disappearing. With less than 24 hours until their father vanishes for good, the two brothers set off with Wilden's bottom half on an adventure to find another gem that will hopefully bring the rest of Wilden's body back into existence.Although the film's simplistic plot is essentially a journey from A to B, Onward more than makes up for this with its wonderfully written characters and heartwarming charm that virtually all audiences can enjoy. There is just so much to admire in the way we watch the two brothers bond with each other as they travel across this now urbanised magical world inhabited with various species of fantasy creatures who have since conformed to a life of normality due to the advancement of technology. This, of course, draws parallels to the real life world, where humans have eased up on our abilities as hunter/gatherers in favour of an easier life thanks to more revolutionary methods of survival. I did feel that this satirical commentary on what has become of our lives in the resulting centuries was a bit lightweight at certain times but I still appreciate that we were shown enough to get the point across and I applaud the writers for this. Additionally, the film is quite funny at times, with most of the comic relief relying on the conflicting personality traits of the brothers as well as some witty sight gags involving the world's whimsical inhabitants going about their daily lives in the most menial of fashion. All of these jokes were properly implemented into the story and never feel like afterthoughts merely written in for runtime padding.As far as animation and visuals go, there is not much more to say than what has already been said for other recent Pixar films. It is beautiful to look at and the nature of the character's movements are as nice as ever. I'll admit I was hesitant about how the final product would look as viewing the film's first trailer didn't excite me all that much but upon seeing the completed film, I was actually taken by surprise at how great it often looked. Characters emote realistically and the fluidity of how they moved said so much more than any amount of dialogue ever did. This is especially the case with Wilden, who despite being primarily a pair of legs, had so much readable body language that even though he was unable to speak, we could still understand how he felt in a particular scene due to how cleverly animated his movements were.I absolutely loved the brotherly love depicted between the two Lightfoot siblings, mainly due to the great performances of both Tom Holland and Chris Pratt. Holland plays his character Ian in a similar way to how he plays Peter Parker/Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Multiverse, a bit awkward but at the same time endearing to the audience. We all can't help but want him to succeed in seeing his father again, even if it is for only one day. Chris Pratt has a great time playing to his talents as the loveable goofball Barley, who despite his somewhat man-child demeanor, is a lot more mature in certain aspects that what he is aware of. Seeing how the two almost polar-opposite characters played off one another provided most of the film's emotional centre and it was wonderful to see how they both stuck together throughout their various challenges and obstacles. However, it is also worth mentioning that the boys' mother Laurel had her fair share of fun moments as well, especially in her scenes with a humorous Manticore named ""Corey"" (voiced by Octavia Spencer). Unfortunately, we don't see enough of these two in action but in the fleeting amount of times they were on-screen provided some great fun. If we ever get a sequel, I hope we see more of their antics.While it may not be as clever or emotional as some Pixar classics, the film has still rightly earned its place among the animation studio's best work. It once again proves that they are capable of creating entertaining films that people of all ages can enjoy and even see a bit of themselves in some of its characters. It is unknown if there will be sequel but I believe there is some potential should Pixar ever decide to make one. Either way, I am satisfied with what we have gotten.I rate it 8.5/10",Onward
95,Alexander_Blanchett,Magical and emotional,8,22 February 2020,"Really beautiful and emotional movie. It won me primarily over by its absolutely fantastic and very detailed animations, look and use of colors.
Truely magical. It had so much time to develope so many different characters even if its just little extras. I would actually watch a TV series based on the lives of those fantasy characters in the suburbans. A very creative idea to actually tell a very simple and common story. The film convinced me because it just touched the right buttons and activated them with the story structure and the relationship between the two leading characters. There is some great voice work, most noteable Tom Holland and Octavia Spencer but also Chris Pratt meets the right tone.
One of the best Pixar movies that came out the last years and one of the most creative and magical ones (more in design than story) for a very long time. It got me close to tears at the end and that means something for a animated film. Kudos to Pixar, they know how to bring magic back t the cinema.",Onward
96,TheTruthofItIs,It's for kids and young families,4,27 April 2020,"It's basically primary school and young family life set in a Pixar animated fantasy world, so it's going to appeal to a fairly focused demographic, so steer clear if you're not in that demo.",Onward
97,cardsrock,Even lesser Pixar still manages to dazzle,8,7 April 2020,"I would place Onward in the middle of the pack in Pixar's filmography, which means it is a quality animated film but not quite on the level of the studio's best. The story is a fun, modern spin on the classic quest adventure and has plenty of good laughs throughout. It feels a little like a DreamWorks animation for a bit, but it manages to showcase some of Pixar's trademark heart near the end. The theme of having a parental figure is a good one and Onward explores it in a meaningful, heartfelt way.",Onward
98,CANpatbuck3664,Takes Awhile to Hit its Stride but Onward Delivers the Pixar Magic in the End,9,15 March 2020,"With all the attention paid to Toy Story 4, it felt like Onward was slipping under the radar a little. I have to tip my hat to Pixar for tackling this kind of a story. Not only is it an original plot (too few of them coming out these days) but they brought their fantastic animation along with them. Onward wouldn't have worked at all if they couldn't make you believe that such a place could exist. But the visual touches are pretty impressive, each rolling hill or magic spell hits the spot and the gag about Ian and Barley's dad works because they know how to let the bit play so you'll laugh along with a silent performance. I wouldn't describe it as the best animated movie we've got from Pixar but it more than passes the test.I have to credit the casting department for picking the perfect fits for the roles, even if the choices were a little obvious. Holland is up to the task but his character Ian shares more than a couple characteristics with his more famous role Peter Parker/Spiderman. He's emotional, timid and strong in the right moments but I wouldn't call this a stretch for him. I would echo that for Chris Pratt but I think he gave the best performance. His energy as Barley is infectious, he helps wrap your head around the more fanciful elements of this world and he keeps you engaged even in the slower paced moments. Julia Louis-Dreyfus is also good, I thought she would have gotten more to do in this story but the reason for that is revealed later on. Her scenes with Octavia Spencer are pretty funny and she gets the job done. Octavia Spencer had me laughing more than a few times as the Manticore, her character's midlife crisis/crisis of confidence could have been really annoying or cliche but she helped keep the movie going and kept it light.The title of my review sums up how I felt about Onward (that's what it should do). Halfway through the movie I was enjoying myself but I was waiting for the next gear or when the movie would live up to Pixar's previous works. But they saved the biggest reveals for the end and they were great. I thought they made some choices that subverted what you expected from the story and highlighted some touching aspects (its a story of brotherhood and trying to find the best in the tough circumstances life deals you) that are different from other similar stories. It changed the direction of the move and it elevated the movie from good to great (I also saw this with my best friend so for me it was also poignant).Urban fantasy is a tough genre to do effectively, it just seems to work better in written fiction as opposed to movies. Onward faces the usual stumbling blocks, there's plenty of fun visual gags and what the creative team decides to include and omit is full of nice touches. But there doesn't seem to be a set of rules governing this world or reason to why we have some modern things in this timeline and other things aren't included. It leads to some puzzling plot points if you're a stickler for continuity.While I also thought Onward was good throughout, it doesn't hit the highs you expect from Pixar until the final act. Its an adventure/buddy comedy but its an anything goes kind of a script and if you're a fan of fantasy or urban fantasy, there isn't anything that's going to make your jaw drop or sweep you away like all of Pixar's best movies do. I did get there eventually, it just wasn't a love at first sight situation.I'm glad I went and checked out Onward in theatres. I thought the trailer for the movie was pretty mediocre and if I hadn't been prompted by my friend, I might have skipped this until the release on streaming. But between the visuals, characters and ending, Onward found its way and I left the theatre ready to sing its praises. I'd rate it and 8.5/10 and in this case I'll round it up to a 9/10. It grades out similarly to Toy Story 4 which was great but didn't hold up to the high bar that picks up the franchise sets for itself.",Onward

100,cliftonofun,Just plain magical,8,4 April 2020,"There were numerous points during this movie where I thought ""Pixar still has it, huh?"" That's partly about imagination or visuals, but it is far more about storytelling and heart. They just get how to give strong characters real wants and complexities and conflicts and...well, quests.

103,elicopperman,Standard yet Heartfelt Adventure,6,11 April 2020,"With the unfortunate outcome of COVID-19 taking place as of now, theatrical films are now either being delayed for a certain period of time or are being released immediately to streaming services. One of which being the latest feature from Disney and Pixar (among another one set for release in June), Onward, as it only played in theaters for a bout two to three weeks before getting pulled out. Set in a modern day fantasy world, the film has been receiving a positive reception from critics and audiences alike. So whether or not this feature will be as beloved as other Pixar films, at least it's a step in a different direction.In this suburban fantasy world, the feature focuses on two elf brothers, Ian and Barley Lightfoot, who set out on a quest to discover an artifact that will bring back their deceased father. Now admittedly, the plot itself is kind of cliched and predictable, as it plays out like a Dungeons & Dragons game given the obstacle-filled journey the two brothers go through to reach their goal. It doesn't help that as fun as the journey can be depending on where the Lightfoots end up, there are too many noticeable Chekov's guns and elements around that may unintentionally give away some plot points before they even show up. Yes, Ian does learn a lot on the trail, like new spells and maturing as a kid, but the formulaic nature of it all makes the film feel more rudimentary than fascinating. Also, the world-building of this modern day medieval fantasy town feels surprisingly lackluster, as if they just made it our everyday city with those specific elements centered around it. It might have made more sense to have the feature still set in a medieval world that just grew and grew over time to make it feel more fresh and inspired.However, what does save the film from falling flat on itself is the father-son relationship. Not only is it the heart of the whole feature, but it also allows Ian and Barley to develop more based on how badly they want to see their dad. Because their late old man meant so much to them, it makes their goal to just see him one last time feel engaging enough to keep the viewers on the edge of their seats. There's also a fun side plot with Ian and Barley's mom Laurel and Corey the Manticore that are way more thrilling and shocking than most of what goes on in Ian and Barley's quest. Plus, the voice actors really do give each character their all to make them feel fun and engaging, like Tom Holland coming off authentically awkward and nervous as Ian, Chris Pratt hamming it up for Barley, Julia Louis-Dreyfuss giving off a good motherly charm with a dash of aggressiveness as Laurel, and Octavia Spencer feeling more energetic than ever as Corey. Even with simple tropes and archetypes, a film's cast can sometimes improve the experience with all the fun they have behind the scenes.As usual from Pixar, the animation is gorgeous and has many creative elements at hand, like the special effects and scope of the whole world. Nowadays, it's gotten almost annoying to see Pixar go super detailed with their environments, especially in contrast with their cartoony and broad character designs, but here it actually works better to present a more ancient archaic look to a world that grew from an era of wizards and magic. If the attempts at mixing modern day suburbia with mystical fantasy don't really come off as anything special, at least the alternate areas and creative special effects give off a good amount of immersive tension to the quest. On the other hand, despite the various types of creatures the movie displays from elves, pixies, centaurs, goblins and more, most of the character designs come off as generic and too similar from one another to really stick out, with a few exceptions like the bulky Manticore and some monsters in varying heights. It's almost as if the filmmakers went for a template construction sheet for each individual species rather than building off of that.So while it may not be among Pixar's strongest efforts due to a conceptually weak story, characters and even world-building, Onward does offer just enough heart, fun thrills, creative visuals and spot-on acting to make the viewing experience feel at least somewhat worth it. Id' say this is worth watching at least once if you're in the mood for a standard albeit fun family film with a decent amount of thrills and heart along the way. It may not have enough magic to live up to its full potential, but what it did offer us is charming enough to warrant its quest satisfactory.",Onward
104,garethcrook,"Not Pixar's best, but the bar is really high.",6,31 December 2020,"So the final film of the year is another Pixar outing. I don't think there's any that I've missed now, but this one slipped by at the beginning of the year. Time was when this wouldn't have happened, I'd be dragged to the cinema with the kids on opening weekend. The kids are growing up though and the cinemas are closed. We're in a world of mythical creatures including Ian (Tom Holland) who's a elf (not the Christmas kind). He's turning 16, missing his dad who's passed away. Generally dealing with the stresses of being a teenager, being awkward, be embarrassed by his older brother Barley (Chris Pratt). Barley believes in a magic that over time has been forgotten. Their dad believed though and now both kids are 16, left a way for him to return for a single day. Things get off to a bad start when they only manage to bring back his legs and have to set off on a quest for another gemstone to finish the job. I don't really do fairytale stuff, but this works... just about. It's pretty straight up adventure stuff with plenty of laughs and the usual journey of self discovery. It looks great, the lighting is lovely and it makes full use of the fantasy theme by dialling the colours all the way up. I'm not sure I'd want to watch it again, but it had me laughing and blubbering in all the right places.",Onward

Within the first few minutes, you see all kinds of magical creatures and are introduced to a fun, new world and a quest that inspires. The movie has plenty of action, humor, and emotion for all ages of viewers who are ready for a fun adventure. It's not Pixar's best animated movie, but it has heart and a message that will give courage to kids on the edge of adulthood. Director Dan Scanlon lost his own father at a young age, so the story takes on a personal level that is heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Death of a parent, talk of a sick person in the hospital
Family, brotherhood, father/son relationships
Bullying Pixie Dusters
I don't know that this will be a big seller but the lead character just might inspire kids who are like him to believe in themselves and the impossible.THEMES:
We often take for granted the amazing things all around us. There is magic in you too. Ian Lightfoot (Tom Holland's character) says, ""With a little bit of magic in your life, you can do almost anything."" In fact, one of the messages is that you can only work the magic if you have self-confidence.
Be bold
Belief in magic and in one's self
Sacrifice for others
Adventure
Courage vs. fear
Use what you have
Challenge yourselfTHINGS I LIKED:
The feels!
I laughed at the mom because she reminded me of myself in a lot of ways. It was cute to see her team up with the ""Manticore"" as they had their own adventure. I was glad the women weren't sidelined in the story. They're voiced by Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Octavia Spencer. Julia Louis-Dreyfus hasn't been in an animated film by Pixar since A Bug's Life 22 years ago. The Manticore was a really fun character that teaches us to reignite the fire within us.
Tom Holland and Chris Pratt are so fun to watch on screen in person, as well as just hear their voices in animation.
Lots of entertaining visual gags and humor.
Amazing animation, as expected by the reliably awesome Pixar. The photo realism was often jarred by the animation, which is what bothered me the most about the movie The Good Dinosaur (Theatrical) , although it wasn't nearly as bad in this movie.
I appreciate that the story is a new idea. Yay fresh!
Hooray for John Ratzenberger. I love that he's included in so many Pixar movies. It's the third time he voices a construction worker in an animation.
I love a good checklist and was touched by Ian Lightfoot's list.
Only having 1 day to spend with their father really raised the stakes and sense of urgency in the plot. Well done.
Ian Lightfoot's character was actually based on Alfredo Linguini from the adorable movie Ratatouille SUCH a cute movie!
Fans of Pixar will appreciate a few Easter eggs in the movie, like their classic Pizza Planet truck that is seen in the film. I love little nuggets like that for fans.
Awwww, man. That big reveal ending really brought me to tears. So touching.
The adorable animated short ""Playdate With Destiny"" featuring The Simpsons: Season 1 and Tracey Ullman's voice plays before this movie in theaters.
Act 3 definitely saves the movie and pulls it all together.
We're seeing more and more animated movies that explore sadness, fear, and even dark subjects that will, hopefully, help kids to prepare for life's inevitable ups and downs.
I thought it was really fun that Barley Lightfoot was an expert on Dungeons and Dragons, making him the perfect guide to take the two brothers on their journey with magic. There's a cute little manual he used that I could see kids wanting to experiment with. Being a nerd has never been celebrated so much before as we're seeing now in films.
I appreciated the portrayal of a step-parent and that often tricky relationship with kids.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
It's never explained how the father who doesn't possess the top half of his body can actually see and walk around. Uh, magic, I guess. It's hard to feel super connected to a character who only has pants on. I worried about this movie when I first saw the trailer, wondering how a creepy half-body was going to be charming in a story. I liked that the pants and their movement looked like they really belonged to a dad and not a boy.
There's actually a pending lawsuit involving a tattoo artist who claims Pixar stole her unicorn design on the van in the movie (the ""Vanicorn"").
Not all the humor lands.
The first few minutes of the movie show so many interesting characters that we never get to see again. I would like to have seen more of them. Sequel?",Onward

109,saadanathan,Pixar are back and they are stunning 8/10,8,15 November 2020,"""Onward"" is a fantastic film by Pixar. After all these sequels they've been making for their previous movies, now we get a brand new original Pixar movie. A story of two elven brothers on a quest to bring back their father for one day. A heartwarming story about brotherhood, losing a father at a young age and adulthood. With another message of how the easy way is never the right one. Tom Holland and Chris Pratt are a dynamic duo in this film and their characters are so funny and good. It seems like Pixar always nailes it with their original ideas and they manage to deliver huge emotions every single time. I'm sorry to say but with everything Disney has achieved over the last decades, they will never receive the same amount of emotions and love as Pixar has achieved. No matter how many unnecessary remakes Disney will do they will just never be as good as Pixar.",Onward
110,andrewroy-04316,"Exceeding my expectations, Onward is another fun, emotional, satisfying Pixar film",8,28 July 2020,"I thought Onward was gonna be another decent but unremarkable Pixar film, but the studio never fails to impress me. I was sold from the opening of the film, and the film maintained a consistent balance of seriousness and comedy that worked perfectly for me, not feeling like it's forcing hip references or snarky humor but letting genuine emotion and realistic moments flavor the dialogue. It's also a less generic and predictable film than I was worried about. The ending is certainly a surprise, and while you could expect the broad strokes of their journey, there were plenty of uncertain moments and surprises along the way. The beating heart of the movie is the wonderful relationship between the brothers, and the climax is a perfect ending to their journey. Both boys are really well fleshed out characters, but the mother is also great, and the manticore is lots of fun as well. The D&D elements and interweaving of magic into modern society were really well done - I love seeing a modern fantasy setting, and that technology is portrayed as a distraction but not as ruinous. The small bits early in the movie do come back around, like the mother's step training and lots of bits that Barley mentions, like the pixies flying or the water fountain. There really isn't a lot here for me to be mad about - it hit home emotionally, the tone is perfect for my taste, and the journey and world was a joy to watch. I'll be curious to see if Soul can surpass Onward for me.",Onward

114,PyroSikTh,"Frustrating and Mis-Focussed, but Still Ultimately Pixar",7,6 March 2020,"Onward follows Ian, a loner who's about to celebrate his sixteenth birthday. He was in utero when his father died of unmentioned causes (but presumably cancer), leaving just him, his mother, and his older brother Barley. Barley, being older, holds his few precious memories of their dad to heart, but has otherwise blown his life away on pipedreams and a D&D-like roleplaying game. Except of course this game being part of a fantasy setting itself is more factual, as Barley keeps stressing. But I digress. On Ian's birthday, their mother grabs a mysterious item from the attic, from their father, offering them a way to spend just one last day with him. Things don't pan out as expected and their father is brought back as a pair of legs, and Ian and Barley embark on an epic quest to find another gem to bring their dad's top half back before the sun sets the next day.First off I feel like I need to preface this by saying my dad is still alive and well, and I don't have a brother either (I have a sister instead), so maybe this movie wasn't really made for me. The emotional element that makes Pixar movies so strong was simply not present for me, because I simply can't empathise with someone who loses their dad at a young age. I've never experienced that, so I don't know what it would feel like. Nonetheless, the idea that this sixteen year old kid would be obsessed with a father he never even met just didn't sit right with me. Sure, I have no doubt he might have some daddy issues, but otherwise he hasn't actually lost anything. He never had a father to begin with. Barley on the other hand did, and treasures the few memories he has. Focussing on Ian and his obsessive need to have his biological dad (because Bronco the step-dad isn't good enough) just felt a little disingenuous. Barley's the one actually suffering with not having their biological dad around any more.All that said pretty much every issue I've just mentioned sort of gets solved at the end. Big spoilers inbound. By the end of the movie, Ian realises that the father-figure he so desperately craved was there all along in his older brother, Barley. Barley was the one who played catch with him, who taught him how to drive, and who shared his life with him. Barley on the other hand does get to see his dad one last time and receives the important words he needed to hear from him. Ian gets what he really needed without him realising, because he had it all along, and Barley got what he needed by finally getting closure with his dad and a chance to say goodbye. There is just one teensy little problem here as well. We spend the entire movie building up to them getting their dad back in one piece, and when it happens, Ian doesn't get to complete the quest he set out for. He never gets to meet the dad he never met, the dad he's been obsessing over for the last sixteen years. Realising your brother was the father figure you needed all along doesn't mean you just don't care about meeting your biological dad any more. Loads of people search for their biological parents even when they got everything they needed from adoptive parents.What's worse is as we're following Ian and not Barley, we don't get to see their dad either. We're stuck with Ian watching from a distance. He's totally cool with it for some reason, but I was sat there feeling frustrated, unsatisfied, and a little angry. He's not even my dad and I'm frustrated that Ian didn't get that moment. Ian's cool with it now, but he'll resent Barley for it as the years go by. For me, this wasn't a heartwarming moment, it was an example of the exact kind of moment that puts a wedge between close siblings. If you lost your dad when you were younger, or had a protective older sibling who helped you and you looked up to, this movie is going to hit all your heartstrings, but I am neither of those people, so this emotional, heartwarming moment gave me absolutely nothing but frustration. Where's our closure as the audience watching this all unfold?The rest of the story was a fairly typical fantasy/adventure quest but with modern elements thrown in. This is what I came to the movie for, but I felt a little let down with this as well. The modern setting is never really made the most of. There's only a handful of genuinely interesting combinations of modern fantasy, like keeping a tiny dragon like a pet dog, or enlarging a Cheeto to use as a boat. Otherwise it was just the exact same stuff we see today; televisions, cars, restaurants etc. The modern-day elements seemed pointless and superfluous. This could've been a straight-up Fantasy and it would have still played out the same way. I hate to say it, but Bright actually did a much better job of blending the two worlds together.The visuals were absolutely fantastic though. Pixar just keep getting better and better every time. While I have started to feel that other studios, like Dreamworks and Illumination, have started surpassing Pixar in visual quality, Onward proves that Pixar are still an animation studio to compete with. All the character designs are great, oozing with...character and personality just from their animation alone. The settings and backdrops are almost always gorgeous to look at, even if it's a seedier part of town. It was almost like watching Who Framed Roger Rabbit with cartoon characters in a world that looked entirely real. Although I do have to say it was a bit weird seeing statues rendered with realistic stone textures, but still having cartoon proportions. I don't know what the solution to that would've been, but it just felt a little off for an otherwise impeccably rendered and designed movie.Onward is not Pixar at their most groundbreaking, and I feel it's emotional element is only really going to strike for those who've experienced it and can fully empathise with it. This was not a movie really aimed at someone like me. I found it unsatisfying, mis-focussed, and a little generic, which was frustrating considering it's fantastical premise. But Pixar have such a consistently high bar of quality, that even at worst, Onward was just okay. At its best it was still hugely entertaining, hilarious, emotionally engaging, and imaginative. I give it a lacking-for-Pixar-but-still-pretty-good 7/10.",Onward
115,baileycrawly,Another Moving Tale,10,22 November 2020,"Onward, primarily, is a story of brotherly love. It tells the story of Ian and Barley Lightfoot. On his sixteenth birthday, Ian and his brother are given the opportunity to bring their father back for one day. When the spell goes awry, they embark on a fantasy role play game-brought-to-life-style quest to retrieve a magical gem to complete the spell and bring their father back.It's a touching yet heartbreaking story, a movie that is definitely steeped in Pixar's trademark emotional manipulation but never feels manipulative. As is the Pixar standard, this is a gorgeously animated film that handles the characters as human beings and provides a seamless marriage between score and visual.The chemistry between Tom Holland and Chris Pratt is completely believable; they feel like two brothers who bonded together over the absence of a father figure in their lives. Their characters have depth, and the character development is completely believable every moment. Even when the film dips its toes into the heavily fantastical elements, it's still grounded in the very simple reality of brotherly love and the desire to have just a little bit more time with those who are no longer with us. The film speaks to the difficult issues of letting go and saying goodbye, but also the importance of siblings and how, despite everything else, at the end of the day they need each other.I also feel compelled to mention that it's a very funny film. Before it (probably) makes you cry, you'll laugh quite a bit, and it's very genuinely funny. Octavia Spencer is nothing short of hysterical in her role of ""The Manticore"" and, as heartwarming as the brotherly dynamic in the film is, the concept also leaves a lot of room for humour, and it's pulled off really well between them.This is yet another fantastic film in the Pixar catalogue and one I will be watching again in the future.",Onward
116,sweidman-28016,One of Pixar's Best,8,16 March 2020,"Onward Review:Dan Scanlon's Onward is set in a suburban fantasy world where two teenage elf brothers, Ian and Barley Lightfoot, go on an journey to discover if there is still a little magic left out there in order to spend one last day with their father, who died when they were too young to remember him. I can't tell you how excited I was to see this. With the talent of Tom Holland and Chris Pratt and it's also Pixar. There isn't a single Pixar film I don't like, except maybe Cars 2, and they keep getting better and better of late it seems. After watching it twice I enjoyed it even more the first time. Onward is one of Disney's best in my personal opinion. Maybe it's because I could relate with it more given circumstances in my life, but I do think this is a very good film! First of all the story is very good. Pixar always has the best stories because they all relate to aspects of life. With Onward we see grief, being yourself, and brotherhood. These topics are strongly riddled throughout. The characters are well thought out and are likable. The chemistry between Ian and Barley is realistic both between the script and the voice acting. I should add that the voice acting is spot on for every character. Tom Holland and Chris Pratt are great with voice work. They always take their characters to the next level and becoming their character while voicing them. I thoroughly enjoyed them throughout. Anyway, there is some good character conflict other than the adventure they go on. The adventure was fun to follow. Sometimes it does move a little too fast, one being with a scene with the Manticore. The film itself is a good length but they maybe needed to take a little something out to slow down that part, or maybe just extend the runtime even more. Where this film doesn't fail is the emotion. The ending had me blinking my eyes a lot to keep in the tears. There's a decision made that I thought wouldn't happen and it just made it even more emotional. Ok happy they went with that route because it made the characters more dynamic. I'm sure most everyone felt that way. Onto the technicalities of the animation, I really liked the designs. The characters had pretty basic designs, nothing over the top, but the detail in it was good. The sceneries in particular were hard not to stare at. Onward is a film that I feel isn't aimed for all ages and some people may stereotype it for boys, which I think is sad. This should be a film for all genders and generations. Also I hate how some animated films are labeled as ""kid movies"". In my personal dictionary, there's no such thing as a ""kids movie"", there's only films where the audience will be mainly aimed for children but is for everyone. That label makes it sound like only kids will enjoy it which is nonsense. Just because something is animated doesn't make it of any less value than something love action. Needless to say, I enjoyed Onward quite a bit. This review is late because it was the end of the trimester for me and with everything happening in the world it has affected some of the stuff I can do. If you are comfortable enough I'd highly suggest seeing it. The box office numbers are the lowest in two decades which has made an impact of this film. It deserves more. Maybe I liked it more than most but so far this is my favorite film of the year!My Grade: A-",Onward

The characters are pretty good too, but the story is incredibly sad. My wife refused to watch it, having lost her dad, and my daughters and I had a good cry fest, especially at the end.

The character arc of both of them is so well done. There's also a great collection of supporting characters, and a really enjoyable story. Not just enjoyable, but also really emotional! God damn you Pixar, you just can't help putting an emotional sucker punch in all your films can you?I absolutely loved the world that they created with Onward. It was so magical, and fantasy lovers will find lots of little easter eggs and fun treats in this.The film looks amazing as you'd expect from Pixar. Top notch animation and a fantastic score as well.

124,Mike_Devine,Great message but unmemorable,6,12 April 2020,"Disney and Pixar have churned out some memorable duos over the years. Buzz and Woody. Nemo and Dory. Mike and Sully. In the studios' latest effort, 'Onward,' we meet the Lightfoot brothers - Ian (Spider-man or Tom Holland) and Barley (Starlord or Chris Pratt). And despite the central message behind the film, it's unlikely that we'll remember them to the degree that we will others.The premise is a good one - two ""oil and water"" brothers seek to connect with their deceased father through harnessing long forgotten magic in their world - clearly a departure from talking mice and cars. It's arguably a little more mature than most Pixar fare, too, which sets it apart from the crowd. The story, although sad, is actually one of the strongest aspects of 'Onward,' unlike most films in this genre.The animation in 'Onward' is also a step up from past efforts, as it just feels more vibrant than they usually do. But as a standalone film, 'Onward' is just not memorable. Sure, it boasts vocal talents from the aforementioned Marvel superheros and Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Octavia Spencer. And yes, it stresses the importance of brotherhood and appreciating those around you, which is a great message to amplify. Still, 'Onward' just does not capture the magic of past Pixar efforts - ironic given the underlying layer of magic here.Disney and Pixar should get points for trying on 'Onward,' but it will likely not be thought of as a highlight in the franchise in the coming years.",Onward

""Onward"" conveys a beautiful message as most Disney films do, it features fantastic animation and a great voice cast. I enjoyed ""Onward"" but I didn't love it. It does pull at your heart-strings but this another one of Pixar's films that goes along the path of ""Cars"" ""Brave"" and ""The Good Dinosaur"".

127,DeBBss,Pixar's best film of 2020,8,18 June 2021,"In my opinion, Onward is Pixar's best animated film of 2020. It does exactly what it needs to do: bringing an emotional story for the kids and the adults. The film starts off as a goofy comedy with its first and second acts, but in that third act, it wraps up the meaning of the story in the most emotional and heartwarming way possible.Onward is also a really funny movie. There were two specific jokes that made me audibly laugh, which I don't do often. The film is also perfectly paced and edited, so time will just fly by when you're watching this movie. And the voice acting was great. The two main stars, Tom Holland and Chris Pratt were flawless and had great chemistry. The entire cast just did a great job.Onward surprised me by how good it was. It's creative and emotional, which is what you'd expect from a Pixar film. There's not a lot wrong with this movie and I feel like it deserves a rating as high as 8/10. Onward is film that you have to watch if you're into these types of movies, it's just that good.",Onward

Any D&D lover would love to watch this. It's also perfect for those who barely knew their father and what they can do with the lives they have left. Can our two protagonists find their father? At what cost? And what adventures will they have? See it!",Onward
129,zeekwunlau,Rush forward for love,8,28 March 2020,"The protagonist, Ian, lost his father at an early age and could only depend on his brother and mother. This made his family unfortunate, but he saw optimism. I am also a family-like person who resonates with this very much, and it hurts me so much that I quit after crying. His brother cares about him very much, but this kind of concern is a taste of his father. After all, the father has passed away. The brother must take care of his brother like his father. ?). Seeing this, I was thinking that there were no brothers beside me, only me and my mother, which made me sad. Later, the two brothers went through many extremely attractive adventures, during which many humorous and touching things appeared (what is it?), One by one for a beautiful theme-father as brother, brother as father . There is a new theme for me-although I have no father and no brother, growing independently depends on myself! !! !! Did you get your own theme from this animation?",Onward

U
Director: Dan Scanlon
Starring: Tom Holland, Chris Pratt, Julia Louise Dreyfus, Octavia Spencer etc
Overall rating 95/100
Onward is based on two brothers called Barley (Chris Pratt) and Ian ( Tom Holland) who gets awarded a wizards staff on his 16th birthday in order to bring back their dead father for just one more day. They must embark on a quest to retrieve everything they need for the spell; relationships will be tested but will the brothers come out the end as united as they were when they started. Wow what a fantastic movie onward was. Truly Pixar at its best with a beautifully thought out original idea there are a lot of good things to say about this so let's get started.First of all, the films animation and world building were fantastic. Wow this films animation was fantastic to look at. Whether it was the fantastic character designs of all the different characters. Or the attention to detail with normal day to day things that made the film look incredibly realistic. They just did so many fun things with the animation that just kept you consistently entertained, and it was completely different to any other animated movie which was another added bonus. The worldbuilding was also incredible for the film. The films delved in deep with the world of Onward and it payed off really well. They went into great detail travelling to multiple different locations and it really made me feel part of there world which is a fantastic thing to feel when watching and made it slightly more believable and fun to watch.Next the film had very likeable characters great chemistry between characters and good usage of secondary characters. There was so many great and likeable characters. Ian had a lovely charm that made you instantly like him as his social awkwardness and struggling to fit in at school will make a lot of people connect to him as a character. And Barley was despite his flaws very likeable as well. And their chemistry as brothers was fantastic, authentic and believable. As their relationship developed as the film went on I grew more and more of a connection with both of the characters, and their brother ship really connected with me and I am sure most audience members who have siblings. I also loved that they gave the secondary characters of the mum Laurel (Julia Louise Dreyfuss) and Manticore (Octavia Spencer) a lot of screen time as well. This was great because they actually felt like part of the movie instead of afterthoughts. They had good character arcs and likeable personalities. With the mum being a character that like her sons is very easy to connect with and got more and more likeable, but also Manticore, her bubbly out there personality really worked and bought the most humour for me as Octavia Spencer did fantastic voice work.Next the film was very funny and had excellent character development. This movie was very funny. With Barley and Manticore definitely providing the most laughs, it balanced its humour and emotion perfectly, with Barleys constant game references and excellent slapstick comedy with his car Gwenevere and Manticore with her witty fast paced humour that always made you laugh. This film also had fantastic character development. Manticore went from being not herself with being the owner of her restaurant to being encouraged to not shy away from her past and be her true self which I thought was great. Ian's was fantastic. As he went from being the shy and antisocial kid to growing in confidence and finding himself and realising how much his brother meant to him after there conflict was a fantastic touch as well.My only two slight nit-picks at the beginning of the film would be its slight pacing inconsistencies and playing it slightly safe. I felt like the film took a little while to properly find its feet. As there were a few scenes that were dragged out slightly to long and effecting the pacing briefly. They also played it slightly safe with the humour and action but this was more than redeemed in the second half but it's still worth mentioning as I did notice this in the first 20-30 minutes.My next two positives would be the films magical elements and fantastic final act. This film really explored its magical elements which was great, this was Barleys speciality which made his character very likeable with his vast knowledge. I loved all the different spells casted and all the different things that Ian had to do in order to cast it, this also led to a lot of comedic moments as well which was great. This also led to a fantastically entertaining final act. As the curse of the phoenix stone lifted a finale battle between Ian and the dragon insued which was of course incredibly entertaining. As they also incorporated the secondary characters very well. It was just incredibly satisfying to have a big magical final act, characters reunited and emotional pay off.My final few positives would be the films heart-warming tone, emotional weight and deep themes and messages about society. Wow this film was incredibly heart-warming, as the film went into detail about how Ian and Barley grew up without a father, their was loads of heart-warming heart to hearts between the brothers or with their mum which really made you emotionally connect with their characters a lot more. Which moves me onto the next point the film had an incredible amount of emotional weight to it. We have come to expect this with Pixar but this felt so organic and natural instead of forced. The film's most emotional moments surprisingly wasn't from the brothers reuniting with their father which is what I was expecting, despite it still being emotional the true emotion came from the brothers realising how they meant to each other, when Ian had a checklist of things to do with his dad, and when he thought he couldn't do those things but realised that Barley was like a father figure to him all of his life It was an incredibly emotional moment. And the films messages about family bereavement, brotherhood and finding yourself was incredibly insightful and left a big impact on me.Overall Onward is one of Pixar's stronger films with fantastic characters and worldbuilding, fantastic animation and character development. And like we have come to expect with Pixar a perfect blend of humour and emotion, leading me to conclude that Pixar is the best animation company there is.",Onward
131,movieman6-413-929510,Onward responds well to the bond between brothers and sisters.,6,7 March 2020,"Onward is a new animation comedy directed and written by Monsters University director Dan Scanlon.The film is set in a magical world where a lot of magic used to be used. To be able to use this magic you have to train yourself first. Many increasingly lost their patience for this and started to tackle their problems in a more technical way. Thanks to this technical revolution, magic was used less and less. In the film, the two eleven brothers Ian (voice of Tom Holland) and Bailey (voice of Chris Pratt) live with their mother Laurel (voice of Julia Louis-Dreyfus). The two lost their father early on even before the birth of Ian. When Ian, in his lonely uncertain time, chooses to use magic to bring his father back to life for a day, he only half succeeds. This is how he managed to bring his father's lower body back. He asks his brother for help to get his father back completely. For this they have to make a quest with their father's lower body in search of the necessary magic.This new Disney Pixar animation responds nicely to a few different stories. This film clearly shows how, thanks to the modern technical revolution, everything has become increasingly digital since the twentieth century. For example, people are now increasingly communicating with each other by using a mobile phone instead of having real conversations with each other. The film also shows how many things have become easier thanks to technology and that people have to make less and less effort. The most important life lesson in this film is about the bond that someone can have with his peasants or sisters. So it can be fun to watch these films together with your brothers and sisters. They also try to capitalize on the element between a father and his children or the element where children have lost a parent or other loved one. Because you never really get to see the father character in the film, this element is somewhat weaker in the film.
This film is more entertaining for children, because the humor and story in the film probably appeal to children a bit more. For older viewers, the film may seem a bit too child-friendly, because the only real tension in the film is the time pressure the characters have to see their father for the last time. There is also no real villain or danger in the film that tries to stop the characters.
The animation in the film looks good again. The film is filled with beautiful animation images for young and old. Unfortunately, there are not many 3D aspects that really make the film worth watching in 3D.The voice acting is done by the cast in a good and appropriate way. Tom Holland and Chris Pratt look good as two brothers, one more uncertain, while the other more clumsy. The two also come across as their characters that they both play in the Marvel film series. Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Octavia Spencer also provide good and appropriate voice acting, but their characters do not have such large or important roles in the film. The two are actually more after the two brothers to ensure that nothing will happen to them during their quest for magic.",Onward
132,sriramthestranger,Pixar's Magic!!,9,7 March 2020,"Honestly, on seeing the trailer, I thought Pixar is going Disney way with too much fantasy, magic and intermittent songs. Glad, the movie failed to prove that. Its a Pixar typical movie where adults can also relate to their brotherhood.

134,dommercaldi,"Fun And Quaint, But Not Anything Special",7,10 April 2020,"Pros:
1. There is great chemistry between Tom Holland (Ian Lightfoot) and Chris Pratt (Barley Lightfoot).
2. Chris Pratt, Tom Holland, and Octavia Spencer (The Manticore) all give brilliant voice-acting performances.
3. The sound design is very good, particularly in regards to the spell-casting and general moments of magic.
4. The score, though pretty generic, does help to add weight to the scenes it's used in, whether they be action scenes or emotional moments.
5. The animations looks fantastic, especially in regards to the creature design.
6. There are simplistically compelling character arcs for both Ian Lightfoot and Barley Lightfoot.
7. The last fight between the cursed stone dragon, Ian and Laurel Lightfoot (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), and The Manticore is quite thrilling to watch and concludes Ian Lightfoot's character arc nicely.Cons:
1. There are far too many cheap plot devices. For example, Ian Lightfoot didn't bizarrely try the staff at the beginning after Barley Lightfoot to build up fake despair. Another one would be The Manticore burning her tavern down because she was read her own quote that she walked past everyday to add needless drama.
2. Most of the comedy falls flat as it tries way too hard.

136,zac-04879,An Emotional Ride,9,3 June 2021,"The finest voice acting of Tom Holland and Chris Pratt makes the beautiful messages of Onward even more of an emotional Disney Pixar tale, focused on an original story of love, family and loss. Not only is the film an entertaining journey for animation fans, but it also features plenty of heartfelt moments that'll bring those tears out of your eyes.The fantasy elements of the film may appear as dull for several audiences, but it's the originality of the magic and the fantasy details that create Onward as a moving adventure. There are also several genuinely amazing lines about family and love, so it's certainly one of the best sibling stories for kids.There are some scenes that you'll notice as a bit lengthy, but it doesn't make the film a waste of time. What's probably the best attribute of the film would have to be the finishing of the movie. Without providing spoilers, Onward's ending isn't completely happy but is satisfying and will leave audiences glad they watched it.

142,austin0731,Mediocre to a degree of being passable,6,10 August 2020,"Pixar's Onward is unfortunately mediocre to a degree of being passable, which is something that for a while seemingly impossible for Pixar to 'accomplish'. There is nothing glaringly wrong about Pixar's latest but unfortunately it misses that Pixar magic. While there were certainly elements that elevate the films status in its great animation and an overall important central them and core message; it told a fairly by the book and safe story of brotherly love and a coming of age. Onward reminds me of the dark days of Disney when they failed to produce top hits and were releasing mediocre animated movies that while wholesome misses the mark at delivering the magic that is the heart and soul of family films. I think in this case Pixar could've taken a much bigger risk in storytelling but resorted to what is simply not that special overall.",Onward
143,Hallelujah289,"Not much to look at, but much better than Frozen 2",9,12 April 2020,"Didn't really expect much from Onward but was very much surprised! The animation look is kind of generic and I felt like I had seen these characters before. Ian totally reminded me of Hiccup from Dreamworks's How to Train Your Dragon but thankfully his character was different.Despite a slow start, the set up of the world was intriguing so I kept on, and a quarter of the way in I was definitely intrigued as the characters go on their main quest. The relationship of the two brothers developed, and while I thought Barley's character was a bit too simplistic (super innocent and gung-ho like his voice actor Chris Pratt), fortunately by the end there was some backgrounding to his behavior which I appreciated. Ian (voiced by Tom Holland) had the more complex character which I appreciated, and I was very moved by his eventual resolution.I had just seen Frozen 2 on Disney+, and after my disappointments there (where are the consequences? still, I rated it 7/10) I was surprised and pleased and moved by how the filmmakers dealt with real loss and how to recover from it without nullifying those feelings of grief like Frozen 2 did (for the most part). Unfortunately in real life what's dead doesn't come back, and I felt like Onward provided some animation style wish fulfillment but also a level of maturity that is hard to come by.I made a comparison to How to Train Your Dragon and on reflection there is a good deal of overlap, such as about bringing magic back into the world, dealing with loss, and resolving matters of skepticism, respect and trust, such as the relationship dynamic with Hiccup and his dad. Except in Onward, it's the shrimpy kid Ian doubting his beefy older brother Barley--kind of for reasons that aren't fully fleshed out, which did pose a lingering question for me throughout the film. Maybe I just missed it I dunno.Anyway without giving away much this is a stellar story in a slightly mediocre package (character designs generic, color palette one note), whereas Frozen 2 is the reverse. I'd pick Onward any day, especially for those dealing with tragedy and grief. In my review though I'll say Frozen 2 isn't terrible on these fronts, and in fact I still recommend it there. But Onward is much more thematically complex and believable, like, on another level of maturity. I will compare Disney-Pixar's Onward to Pixar's other movie Up or Chris Pratt's other movie Guardians of the Galaxy 2. I'll compare Frozen 2 to Tom Holland's other film Avengers: Endgame (blegh).While I'm ripping on Frozen 2 I will say actually Onward and Frozen 2 share a similar character in Ian and Elsa, both powerful mages but mostly insecure. I applaud Disney for continuing to deal with themes of insecurity and grief, etc, but definitely note Pixar's studio continues to have the better handle here.",Onward
144,bastos,Liked it a lot,7,16 January 2021,"This is a bit of a divisive movie. I'm on the liked it a lot camp. I think people have unreasonably high expectations when it comes to Pixar movies. I guess it's Pixar's fault because they have been releasing classic after classic for more than twenty years now, so I can understand where some of those expectations come from, but to dismiss a movie because it doesn't meet some of the high standards is a bit too much also. This is a very good adventure movie with some great world building, great animation, good characters and an amazing third act, you can't demand much more than that. Granted, I can understand some of the issues people have, like pacing problems in the second act, a bit of a predictable plot and what is becoming a cliched Pixar family. Those are the reasons I don't rate this any higher, but it was still an emotional and entertaining ride that I highly recommend.",Onward
145,TheVictoriousV,"Good movie by ""post WALL-E"" Pixar standards",5,11 March 2020,"Selling itself as the first Disney-Pixar joint to feature an openly LGBTQ character, supposedly trumping the last time we had a ""first time"" with the blink-and-you'll-miss-it lesbian couple in Finding Dory (not to mention all the Marvel heroines that Twitter and other fangirls have decided are totally dating), a character that barely appears in the movie was still the best we could do. If this is how you need to market your projects (with ""We care 'bout the cause, lol"") now that people are seemingly losing faith in Pixar's capacity for great stories, at least go the distance. The woke demo is getting better at seeing through your ploys. Remember Charlie's Angels? No? Exactly.Will this ""inclusivity"" still upset some and please others? Probably, but I don't know what either side was up to when we got our last queer cyclops from Disney in the form of the way more visible Pleakley from Lilo & Stitch. Could it be that identity politics, tribalism, and pandering in the social media age has made us really pliant? Pft! Nah!Oh right, I'm supposed to talk about Onward and how I liked it. Sorry, guys; it's gotten hard to remember what movie reviews are meant for. Not that I have much to add; this is another one of those Pixar movies that is at best ""okay"", which is pretty good for the output after Toy Story 3 (but even that one is losing me since Pixar's love of ticket money and merchandising, which led to Toy Story 4, made sure it's no longer the perfect closure I once praised it as).Supposedly, this was going to be a return to form: a break from all the sequels and whatnot. However, this is what people said of Inside Out and Coco, neither of which I admire that much more than the string of sequels that preceded each (I even think Incredibles 2 is kinda good).The movie takes place in ""a suburban Fantasy world"", touching on the always amusing concept of fairy-tale creatures sometimes leading pretty mundane lives, and stars Tom Holland and Chris Pratt as two elf brothers who wish to find the spell that may resurrect their father. As we meet them, their Fantasy world isn't the land of magic and battles it used to be; the brothers' discovery that their dead father was a wizard (and not an accountant, as they were led to believe) sets things in motion.This is a humorous and decently interesting premise, and the voice cast (also consisting of Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Octavia Spencer, the inevitable John Ratzenberger, et cetera) do well enough to make the characters and their relationship feel genuine. And as usual, the animation is beautiful to an almost excessive degree, giving us lifelike clothing textures, photorealistic hair, and other stuff that looks strange on cartoonishly designed elves. I maintain that Rango is the one 3D-animated film to nail photorealism mixed with stylized designs.Time will tell if Onward will have the same impact on children as the Pixar classics, or if the parents will be moved on a different level, as was true of Finding Nemo, Ratatouille, and The Incredibles. My overall impression is positive, but I'm still missing the real magic.Is it just me, or does Disney and Pixar's recent fascination with one-word titles make their films sound really boring? This isn't a problem with the movie as such, but it might be unwise for the marketing, even if the films do manage to become well-liked hits. But in the future, who's gonna put aside fairy tales like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs or Beauty and the Beast or The Princess and the Frog, and instead pull out an archived copy of one of the more recent films?Tangled? Who's tangled, and by what? What does that tell me? Next, please! Brave? The heck is that? It's just another adjective. Frozen? So it's about ice or something? Why's that special? Onward?

147,carlos37andre,"I mean...c'mon, Pixar!",10,22 March 2020,"It's so sad that this movie isn't going to do well at the box office, cause of the whole situation we are up to. But man, the movie is fantastic.It has a heart since its first scene! It's engaging, the characters are relatable, the story is so emotional, the stakes are always so high, and at the end... it's has just a powerful message of: Sometimes we get so focused on getting the things we don't have, that we never really stop to enjoy the thing we do have!I can't state enough, how strong and beautiful the story is. I saw some interviews before the movie, mainly Chris Pratt talking about what the movie meant to the director, and that it's truly a story based on things that really happened in his life, and man... that's just what movies are about, expressing.I love the world they built around that. Besides the story and the journey, the characters go through themselves, the world building is crazy good. The concept of being in a world full of magic and mythological creatures, and the fact that... they just gave up on magic because technology is ""easier"" is amazing lol! It makes the world ""believable"" while also being a great joke all throughout.To sum up, Onward is yet another funny kid friendly Pixar movie, that a child can watch and have fun with all the colors, the action, the animation and the jokes, but to the older audience, it has so much under the surface! It's a heartfelt, emotional and thoughtful journey, and I'm certain a great love letter from the director, that we can use to learn from it, and start enjoying more the little things we have always had in life, but never truly stopped to be thankful for.",Onward
148,Christopher_Reid,"Solid Pixar movie, pulls the heartstrings, pretty funny",9,9 May 2021,"Pixar seems to have mastered certain things. They make it look easy while other studios try and usually fail. Specifically, they are great at those quiet contemplative moments, when characters look around them, remember things, realise something, etc. They capture all the little emotional details so effectively. That isn't just a matter of writing and story, a big part of it is also directing and animation. Subtle facial expressions, the way your eyes move, the body language, the timing of things.Anyway, Onward makes use of these techniques to basically guarantee that you'll cry or at least be moved by the end. It's as creative as most Pixar movies, basically creating it's own world, even it's kind of a hodge-podge of other generic fantasy worlds. With this comes the typical jokes and references - Finding Nemo has ocean humour, Monsters, Inc. Has monster humour and I guess Onward has elf or fantasy humour.The concept is pretty unique, even if the surrounding details are pretty typical. A boy who never really knew his father, wants to know more and wants to figure out who he is. Of course, it's no surprise that the answer was kind of there all along. It's pretty interesting and funny though - his father left a magical spell to let him visit for one day. But it doesn't quite work - only his lower body appears, a pair of legs. It's a clever and amusing image.The high jinks throughout the movie are fun but not exactly brilliant or revolutionary. But the fantasy elements allow for some funny variations on familiar tropes. Like nearly getting found out by the police while a magic spell is starting to wear off.The main focus of the movie is about the sadness of having a dead father and wanting to know what he was like. The moment is handled really well. It's almost like Jesus in Ben-Hur - it would be too big a task to directly show him so instead we see his effect on people. Unfortunately. Ian Lightfoot doesn't get to meet his dad, only his older brother does. But at least he seems from a distance, his dad can leave him a message, his older brother gets some catharsis and he realises that he kind of had a dad all along - his brother. That's who looked out for him and went on adventures with him. It's a nice message, not exactly brand new but it rings true.It's an uplifting movie with many original ideas, plenty of funny moments and those trademark Pixar feels. There's also a fair amount of adventure and action and of course the graphics are incredible like always.",Onward

153,hunter-friesen,"""Onward"" warms the heart",7,6 April 2020,"Set on an Earth where the magical and mythological exist together, Pixar's newest animated film, ""Onward,"" tells the tale of two elven brothers.The story begins on the 16th birthday of the younger brother, Ian Lightfoot, who never was able to meet his dad as he had died before Ian was born.As a surprise gift for his now grown-up son, the father left a staff that, when combined with a spell, will bring him back to life for a full day. Unfortunately, the spell doesn't go as intended and only reanimates the lower half of the father.To bring back the other half, a rare gem must be acquired that is hidden deep within a mystical mountain. With only twenty-four hours available, Ian and his older brother, Barley, must set out on a quest to fulfill the spell and bring back their dad for one last moment of bonding.""Onward"" is directed by Dan Scanlon, a Pixar veteran and second time director who previously helmed ""Monsters University."" Despite his best efforts, Scanlon still doesn't seem to have the same directorial knack that many others before him have possessed.Scanlon's pacing of the film is both rushed and predictable, with the middle third being the most egregious example of this folly, as it re-hashes the same beats over and over again. The final third is able to pick things up a little but it too falls into the recent trend by Pixar to substitute light and noise for simple storytelling.Fortunately, Scanlon's supplementary material helps distract from his shortcomings. The animation is breathtaking as usual and the score by Mychael and Jeff Dana is wonderful as it balances both the epic and whimsical tone of the film.Scanlon lends his hand to the script, which is also co-written by Jason Headley and Keith Bunin.Similar to the directing, the writing in the first half does no favors as it rushes from location to location with nothing but the basic plot on its mind. A sense of emotional complexity that is usually found within Pixar's narratives is sorely absent here.But once the halfway mark hits, the film vastly improves as the emotional core of the story hits like a ton of bricks. The writing trio reminds you once again of the magic that Pixar wields as the earlier and underdeveloped themes of brotherhood and fatherhood are given new life in only a few short minutes.As a sibling with a younger brother, the sentimentality of the story hit deep, leaving me in more of an emotional wreck than I was prepared for.Like all Pixar films, the impeccable voice work among the cast works hand-in-hand with the writing to develop the characters.Tom Holland voices our main hero, Ian. It's a bit of perfect casting by Pixar to have Holland play the shy, awkward character that must learn to control his newfound powers. Holland's experience from his web-slinging days allows him to play to his strengths.With the LEGO franchise and now this movie, Chris Pratt is starting to stake his claim as one of the best voice actors working today. Pratt plays the more rambunctious brother, Barley. His natural charisma enhances the material and creates some of the film's funniest moments.And as a bit of a bonus, the casting of Holland and Pratt in the lead roles give us a glimpse of what a possible Spider-Man and Star-Lord buddy movie would look like.While it may not be the finest work Pixar has ever done, the abundance of heartwarming magic found within ""Onward"" makes it an enjoyable tale for all ages.",Onward

155,snowfre,Cute and fun but without the emotional punch Pixar usually delivers,7,22 April 2020,"Disney-Pixar's ""Onward"" is a vibrant fantasy film set in an urban world inhabited by trolls, centaurs and pixies, directed by Dan Scanlon. As always with Pixar, the animation is flawless and in this movie, we're also getting amazing fairy tales settings and dazzling fantasy environments that I wish they could explore more. There is a lot of potential that goes, not to waste, but a bit under the radar in ""Onward"", both in terms of world building and storytelling. We get to follow elf brothers Ian (Holland) and Barkey Lightfoot (Pratt) who embarks on a quest to bring their dead father back to life for one day. ""Onward"" touches on subjects such as death and moving on in a cute, family friendly matter, although the heavily emotional, borderline squeamish way, that has become Pixar's successful, and artistically good, formula is not present as in their other productions. It is a bit of a bummer, as I think the premise for the film could have included some really emotional moments, making ""Onward"" a much more memorable film for the studio. It is however, still a beautifully animated, funny, quirky movie with several entertaining characters. MCU cast members Tom Holland and Chris Pratt are defiantly cut for their roles, Holland as the insecure teenager struggling with his father's death, and Pratt as the adventure-seeking, nerdy buffoon - their contributions to the film might actually fall out as the best voice acting of the year.",Onward

They decide to go on an adventure to get another magical crystal to finally meet their dad!Onward was a film that was on my most anticipated movies of the year list. I wouldn't say I couldn't wait to see this film, but I was defiantly looking forward to it. When I walked out of the theatre, I was happy with this film. It wasn't the best Pixar film I have seen, but it was pretty good. First of all, the animation was fantastic. I don't know if I should stop mentioning it because it is just always good. The backgrounds were something you could look at for hours! They looked like they were right from a photo album. I thought the acting was great too. Chris Pratt gave a really good performance. I always find sympathy for his character. I don't really know why. Tom Holland did a good job too. I think he is starting to become an actor that works with Disney a lot. The whole world was something I found very interesting too. I didn't really like the scorpion person. I know she was put in there for laughs, but I just didn't really like her. Besides that, the world was great. It had many interesting things that were worth making a sequel for in my mind. The story wasn't bad either. The message I thought was a recycled one though. They just decided to go with a typical message. I thought that was a little lazy and they should have come up with a different message.Overall, Onward was a fun family film I would recommend for anybody who loves Pixar or fantasy worlds.",Onward

163,rmirchandani,Another solid Pixar movie!,9,28 March 2020,"Pixar has consistently knocked it out of the park. The newest Pixar movie titled ""Onward"" tells a unique and intriguing story about brotherhood, parenthood and letting go of the past. Even though, the movie did not quite resonate with me, it was still entertaining and gripping from start to finish. Like the rest of the Pixar movies, Onward is a family friendly movie.Onward primarily focuses on a 16-year old boy named Ian who is rather introverted and has mild anxiety issues. His brother Barley, on the other hand, is the polar opposite of Ian. He is outgoing, spontaneous and not afraid of trying new things. On Ian's 16th Birthday, his mother revealed a gift for him and his brother from his father. The gift turns out to be a magic staff that manages to resurrect Ian and Barley's father for one whole day. This leads to an epic road trip full of surprises and heartfelt moments.This movie is jam packed with action, humor and emotion. Whenever a twist is solved, an even bigger twist is created. I loved how the movie balances the humor and emotion. One minute you're sobbing like a baby, and the other you're laughing out loud. It is genuinely a pleasant and enjoyable movie. One of Pixar's finest movies since ""Inside Out.""The third act of the movie was amazing and unexpected. Ian grew tremendously as a character and proudly checked off his list. It was a bittersweet moment when the two brothers hugged it out. Barley being the one who meets his father is perfect and shows how empathetic Ian is.To conclude, Onward is another stunning Pixar movie that pulled on my heartstrings immensely. It is quite evident that Pixar is trying something different with its new lineup. The Pixar movies ""Coco"" and ""Inside Out"" were family friendly movies, but tackled real life issues. Even this year's June release ""Soul"" tackles a rather complex issue about what it means to be human and what exactly our purpose is. Pixar manages to create a compelling story with whimsical characters for children, whilst also educating them about certain issues. This is the beauty of Pixar. It will always be suitable for children and adults. To be candid, I was quite cynical when I first watched the trailer of Onward, but it managed to completely exceed my expectations. It was just a pleasant surprise. Everyone should watch this movie with their whole family.",Onward
164,samyoung-82648,Needs more magic dust,7,9 March 2020,"Pixar films used to be special because they really got to the heart of their characters. Pixar's films never felt contrived (eg. forced diversity). You didn't feel like Pixar were ticking boxes. Despite some good moments, this film was pulled into forced diversity.
The film was borderline being one big fart joke. When you have a film with two male leads, Pixar seem to dumb the story down to avoid social outrage. If the story has a female lead (eg. Brave, or Inside Out), the story focuses on intelligent themes. By contrast, if the lead is male, the focus is on moronic behaviour and fart jokes (The Good Dinosaur, Onward).
Then, you have the forced diversity. It isn't as bad as some recent films from Hollywood. However, the film has female police (check), and female manticore (check) that felt out of place in this film. These characters didn't work for me.
So, what remains was pockets of sincerity. There's a decent scene with a bridge and a few family moments. The rest was identity politics and fart jokes. From a company that used to deliver magic, this film just doesn't quite work. However, if you watched Toy Story 4 and thought it was magic and didn't have identity politics, you will probably like this film.
I gave it 7 because I felt Pixar was 100% committed to lowest common denominator and identity politics, but, they held themselves back. Sadly, with identity politics, you're either onboard or you're not. This film needed more Pixar magic. It's better than the Good Dinosaur, but, far short of Inside Out.",Onward
165,Reckno64,Another Solid Pixar movie that I think is better than most people are saying,10,12 March 2020,"This may TECHNICALLY be one of Pixar's weaker movies, but that's only because their track record is so good! Onward is a very nice animated movie that I believe still surpasses Illuminations best movies. Despicable Me is good, but this is even better, so I think if you liked that movie, you should be able to enjoy this one too! The story follows 2 brothers named Ian and Barley who lost their dad when they were toddlers, and on Ian's 16th birthday he is given a gift his dad left behind which turns out to be a magic staff that can cast various spells. Gifted with the staff is instructions on how to bring him back for a single day using a spell. As you probably saw in the trailer, the spell goes awry and only their dad's legs turn up, and they have to find a gem to finish the spell within 24 hours. What follows is an endearing quest with some funny moments, but also heartwarming moments. Chris Pratt's character Barley may come off as annoying to some, but he means well and personally I didn't find him anywhere as annoying as everyone else. Ian is a nervous wreck at the start, but develops throughout (well all the characters are slated to develop, it's a Pixar movie after all :))And that was one thing I always like to see in film; character development. Some movies (looking at YOU Illumination) don't seem to know how to develop their characters all the time, but Pixar seems to make sure this happens even in their weaker movies (WELL maybe not Cars 2, but everything else yes) and to me that is one of the most important things a movie can do. Onward focuses more on character and world-building, and less on humor. And personally, I prefer a movie or show that does that over focusing on just being funny. There really isn't much comedy in this film, but it didn't bother me one bit as the things it did do well it excelled at. And to be fair I did laugh like 7 times, so which for me is more than I usually expect while watching a movie. So I think you will have a good time if you are looking for a few laughs at least.And the part of this movie that ultimately made it for me was the last 20 minutes. The climax at the end is really REALLY well done to the point I would say even if this movie sucked up until this point, it would be worth it just to get to that ending. No spoilers as I suggest you see it for yourself, but it does bring on the feels that Pixar is well known for, and isn't as ""Happily Ever After"" as the average Disney movie tries to be. Either way I really appreciated the ending, and I always look forward to getting my heartstrings pulled. Pixar is the only mainstream animated movie company to regularly pull these punches. I mean other studios have had at least a few emotional moments at some point in their movies, but Pixar does this more than anyone else, and I for one really appreciate having them around for that.This isn't the saddest of Pixar movies, but it did bring as much feels as Toy Story 4 and almost as much as Coco for me. I definitely recommend it personally, and hope for more movies like this from Pixar! Let's hope Soul is just as good if not better! Ultimately I give Onward an 8.5 out of 10, but rounded up to a 9 cause I liked it so much. :)Bravo Pixar! Keep giving us great animated films!!!!",Onward
166,theredsky,Onward Review,5,7 April 2020,"I truly love Pixar. It's still probably one of the best animation studios working today but I have noticed a slight decline in the quality of their films since 2011. Not to say their films from 2011 on are bad (except Cars 2), they just aren't as good as their films from the 90's and 2000's. I would say Pixar's last truly great films would be Inside Out and Coco and unfortunately, their mediocre streak is carrying over into this decade. Onward is a very mixed film for me. On one hand, I liked the animation, music, 3rd Act, and themes of brotherhood but I also didn't like the first two acts and the characters. Characters are essential to making a Pixar film interesting to watch and I found the characters here not that interesting. Pixar has a fantastic track record for making interesting characters such as The Parr family from The Incredibles and Remi from Ratatouille. I'm not comparing the characters from those movies to the ones in Onward but I'm just trying to make a point that Pixar is very capable of making great characters but for some reason, they couldn't do it here. I do like the brotherhood message that they share but that's really about it. I didn't find any of them relatable nor did I find myself interested by their actions. They change as people but it didn't follow an interesting path. They just kinda changed suddenly and without question. The build up to the 3rd Act of the film was slow and dull to me. I wasn't interested in the adventure at all and it felt like it took a really long time before the 3rd Act started but after that point, I found myself enjoying the film which is a shame because I finally started to enjoy the film when it was about to end. The final action scene used the environment well and was enjoyable to watch and the realization that Ian has was good. I just wish the lead up was much much more interesting. That's not to say there weren't other factors that I liked about the film. Obviously, the film looks fantastic. This is something that has remained consistent with almost every Pixar movie. The visuals are spot on and the locations look really good and somewhat realistic for a fantasy world. I also thought the music was great. It was the only thing I really noticed during the first two acts and some of the music in the 3rd act can/do have the potential to bring some to tears. Overall, Onward is a step down in terms of characters and interesting stories for Pixar but it still retains its great visuals and music streak going.",Onward

169,TheMovieDoctorful,Pixar's Best in Years!,9,24 March 2020,"Onward is the first great film of 2020 for me and easily Pixar's best film since Inside Out. I've heard many complain that this is far from Pixar's best, but this is easily in the top 4 for me along with Toy Story 2 and Monsters Inc.I had my doubt going into this one, since I'm not a fan of Dan Scanlon's Monsters University, but I think he's really learned from the mistakes of that film and changed his ways as a filmmaker. He veers more away from world building this time around (the biggest weakness of Monsters University) and focuses much more heavily on character building, which definitely seems to be more his strength.For just one example, take the way he handles brothers Ian and Barley. It begins as a typical ""cowardly dweeb finds his inner strength"" story with Ian as the hero and Barley the sidekick, but slowly and naturally transitions into Barley's hero's journey as the film goes on. Ian is a kid with his life ahead of him while Barley is quickly running out of time to make something of himself and the film understands that when it exposes him as the true hero. It's a refreshingly different and clever examination of an introvert wearing the mask of confidence that I'm surprised that the company behind Toy Story 4 was capable of pulling it off.I absolutely adored the Corey character. It's Olivia Spencer's funniest performance in decades and the film actually gives her solid motivation behind her fall from grace that isn't seen in similar redemptive character arcs. For such a fantastical film, Onward is still steeped in grounded themes and moral consequences, and I absolutely loved that.Of course, a big piece of what makes that work is the voice acting and the animation. Pratt's Barley falls into this sweet spot between the jaded figure of tragedy of Owen Grady and the goofy man child of Starlord, he's always fully convincing as either. Tom Holland is frankly a much better voice actor than a physical one and his performance as Ian may be a career best. The character designs have as much imagination as they do personality, these are some of the most interesting I've seen in years. A warforged High School dragon near the end is particularly inspired and even genuinely creepy.The only problem I really found in the film was that I feel the stepdad character was fairly underdeveloped with how much screen time he had, but the arcs of Ian, Barley and Corey more than make up for it in the overall narrative.It's a good thing Onward came when it did, because I was starting to lose hope in 2020 films. That being said, it breaks my heart that it's being labeled one of the ""lesser Pixar films"", especially when things like the Cars films and The Incredibles 2 exist. At the very least, this actually had a soul somewhere, which those films severely lacked.",Onward
170,jordyntsmith,"Better Than Expected, Though Not Strong",7,14 March 2020,"Onward is not one of Pixar's strongest entries, but it certainly an emotional and powerful movie nonetheless. While interesting, the world of Onward is less focused and engaging than other Pixar properties which contributes to its weaker story.However, the movie still hits many powerful emotional needs and touches on issues of family, loss, and love in a way which feels deeper than some other Pixar movies. I think the film would have benefited from a slightly longer story with more time to flesh out these themes (and the world at large) in more depth.",Onward

SUPER MAGIC.,8,23 March 2020,"Onward is one of those films that Disney has get used us to watch, one of those that has everything: emotions, meanings, adventure and bonds. Technically speaking it is one of the most successful Pixar films; skyrocketing CGI, elements that blend in with reality and an avant-garde sound sector for an animated film. Onward, rather than being a Disney classic, is placed amongst ""modern"" Disney films and therefore makes itself a different and original. Excellent plot highlighted by the excellent acting by Chris Pratt and Tom Holland, who never tire and never disappoint. Direction not always constant, but the final product remains, which is decidedly superb and successful. ONWARD is the CGI representation of the acceptance of races, genres and above all of the most obvious bonds; which in fact are not so obvious; those bonds that, in life, are nourished of adventure and magic.",Onward

I didn't know WHAT to expect. But around April, I began to be a bit more open about watching the movie. I thought that it probably wouldn't be so bad after all. And let me tell you, I was pleasantly surprised at what I saw. The characters are amusing, the dialogue is good, the story and the premise is interesting, and the acting is great.

174,mbrcf,definitely a low tier Pixar,4,31 March 2020,"This film didn't quite do it for me unfortunately as I found myself not caring about the two brothers and their quest at all. The animation is on par with everything Pixar has been doing but the world created here felt generic and sort of mundane. The dragon pet, the centaur police officer who is using cars instead of actually running, the once fierce manticore turned innkeeper and so many other examples that I felt I've seen before.I was also really displeased with Holland and Pratt's voice acting and was relieved when the talking part ended. Overall I wouldn't recommend this film as there are several better options around.",Onward
175,timeblank,A Must-See Brotherly Bond Movie.,9,8 March 2020,"Onward is about two brothers, one who is not confident, and the other one who loves adventure. Magic has faded from the modern world. Their Dad passed away, Tom Holland's character just turned 16. His Mom has held a special gift until her son's 16th birthday. Chris Pratt is the older screwed up brother and when both boys finds out they can bring their dad to life, they have 24 hours to spend time with him.What's messed up is when their Dad's bottom half appears, due to the Phoenix Gem and the gem shatters. The two brothers must find the second gem or risk losing the time to see their father. I love seeing the great brotherly bond in this movie. It is a nice change that Disney Pixar has done. Chris and Tom chemistry was perfect. Every time Chris gives his brother some magic lessons it has your eyes glued to the screen. How it ends is great. I was not disappointed with this film.",Onward
176,haydenluz,Onward,5,5 January 2021,"Onward, directed & written by Dan Scanlon, who also directed & wrote Monsters University, was an entertaining fairytale, embracing the importance of familyhood. Onward had an original concept coming in, but the direction from Scanlon didn't flow the greatest, having a few forceful filler scenes. Though the story didn't flow the best with a few imbalances, Scanlon managed to hit a few emotional notes that hit home, to get you more invested in the adventure & characters.With a very talented voice over cast of Tom Holland, Chris Pratt & Octavia Spencer, I expected something a little more hard hitting. They all had their own enjoyable personalities, but the characterization could've been a little better. Tom Holland's character was real easy to invest in. Right off the bat, you feel his pain, and see the hardships he deals with. I personally connected with his character due to his aspirations involving his father. As far as Chris Pratt, I didn't really care his character all that much. I liked that he is a polar opposite of Holland's character, and that creates the strong bond, but he's pretty annoying throughout the first hour of the film. His final act character development is what saved him from being just flat out stupid, and nothing more than a plot device. The realistic expectations each brother had, displaying a genuine brotherly bond was the best part about their characters.The screenplay by Dan Scanlon, Keith Bunin & Jason Headley had a few decent laughs, but they also had a few forceful jokes that didn't quite hit. Even though the script captured some real life events, it didn't pack the weight it could have, leaving the script a little thin.The cinematography and animation was of course, gorgeouse, utilizing some great bright, and dark colors to enhance the tone throughout the film.Overall, with all this pandemic going around, Onward didn't get to reach it's full potential in theaters, but I would say it's a solid watch on Disney+, especially if you have a brother.",Onward

There's nothing extraordinary going on... just something (which I admit is) fairly light-hearted and enjoyable. And it does have its moments of heart and emotion, but it never was as good as to strike me to be anything above average.The animation of course, is amazing as usual... I mean, it's Pixar, so that's a given. And even the comedy; while not rib-tickling in any way, wasn't bad either. The characters were pretty generic, and the storyline was too. But I think the emotions and the motivations that drove the climax was pleasantly enjoyable.And that's pretty much it. Just an average flick; not bad, not great.",Onward

180,mbhgkmsgg,Onward,8,20 November 2020,"I have always spoken about how Pixar films are filled with a sense of adventure. Well, now they finally made a movie that is nothing but an adventure. But, as is the case with Pixar's films, there is always some deeper meaning underneath the shell that is the story, and Onward is no different.The main themes in this one, and ones that are relevant throughout, are making do and appreciating what we have. Be it on a quest or in life. Barley keeps telling Ian that on a quest you have to make do with what you have. As the movie goes along and reaches its end, it becomes evidently clear that this mantra applies to our lives as well. Appreciating what we have can be difficult since we are always striving for what we don't have. But taking a moment to reflect and finding importance in those around us is, at least according to Pixar, the key to happiness.I already touched upon it in the beginning, but I have to talk more about it. It's that sense of wonder and adventure. The thing that I have always liked the most about Pixar's films. Whenever I watch these movies, I completely forget about everything that's happening around me and just let myself fall and get lost into the adventure that's on the screen. These movies always manage to make me feel like I'm a kid again. In this regard Onward is fantastic. It's basically DnD made into a movie. It's a 100-minute adventure filled with fantasy and creatures and magic and anything else that you could ask for. For someone like me, who has always loved that stuff, this movie is right on the money.Like most movies, Onward isn't perfect. One of the reasons I have always preferred Pixar films to Disney ones is that they have always been more subtle about pushing the message and theme of the film. This one, however, made it very obvious what the deeper meaning and lesson was. Still, it did end up being very emotional by the end, and I most certainly got a little teary-eyed.In a way, this is a perfect Pixar film. It takes the thing that makes these films so good and makes a full movie out of it. I can never have enough adventure and wonder in these films, and Onward delivers. But it also has its problems. And while it isn't as good as some Pixar films, it's still a fantastic journey filled to the brim with emotion and a heartwarming message.",Onward
181,emryse,Incredibly Average,6,13 July 2021,"This movie is okay, I mean it had some parts that were genuinely kind of emotional and I thought that the whole film was decent, the thing is though that when you get a Pixar movie you expect more. I didn't watch this film upon release because I thought that the story looked mediocre and not very creative, I also thought that the animation in this film looked really run of the mill, something you can't really say for any other Pixar film, I eventually got around to watching it on a free Saturday afternoon and thought that it was okay but that it was no more than that, the story just isn't that interesting and felt like it could have been made by any studio, the problem with Pixar is that they've made such good films that anything less than perfection feels like a let down. If you have a young child this film will be pretty good but if you want to watch a Pixar film then this is one of the lesser ones in my opinion.",Onward

183,stefstars,"Not Pixar's best, but likeable.",5,11 March 2020,"This one's one of those ""if you've seen the trailer, you've seen the movie"" films. The movie moves really fast at the beginning, to the point where it didn't give me time to care about the main characters and their story. I was annoyed for a good chunk of the movie, up until the brothers have their quarrel (Ian considering Barley a screw-up). After that, the film gets more interesting, well a little bit. Sadly, you can't come into this one expecting something as good as ""Inside Out"", ""Up"", or ""Coco."" Even the sequels have been better than this one. This film was like a mix of ""Frozen 2"" and ""The Good Dinosaur"" - that's not a good thing. Personally, I like Chris Pratt's character. For me, he's the only interesting character in the entire film. His story is more interesting to me than Ian's, Tom Holland's character. If you've watched ""Parks and Recreations"", Chris Pratt is playing that same character just slightly less dumb.As mentioned before, pacing is the main issue with this film. I read it took 8 years to make this film and with that much time, I'm not sure why so much of it felt rushed. It's like they were so excited to get to the quest sequence of the film that they didn't fully explore the world these characters live in or give the audience time to warm up to the late father or any other main character for that matter. Having that random character at the fantasy world Burger King basically give an exposition on the father was very un-Pixar like. That's all we're given by the way when it comes to learning about who the father was. When the big wizard reveal happens about the father's past, it's yadda-yadda'd - the character remains uninteresting until Barley reveals the 4th memory he has with him. I did get teary eyed towards the end. It does have a touching moment, but it takes a looong time to get to that point. Even the epiphany moment that leads to that touching scene is rushed (Ian realizing Barley has been the father he thought he was missing.)Kids will probably like it though. Sadly, this one was a miss for Pixar.",Onward

When I watched this film, it's just like Spider-Man and Star Lord going on an epic quest for adventure, danger and magic. It's ironic that Tom and Chris are working together just like in the MCU. I like this film and there were parts that made me laugh. But there were some emotional scenes that made me want to cry. This is why I like the films made by Pixar. I like the story of two brothers bonding with each other. I wish I can go on a quest for danger and magic. I enjoyed every moment of this epic film. Well done, Pixar. 👏👏👏👍👍 TWO THUMBS UP!!!",Onward
185,WasiReviews,Nothing Incredible but Still Subversive,8,3 March 2021,"The general consensus on this film is: ""oh this film isn't bad per say but it's middle of the road for a Pixar film nothing groundbreaking."" I have to say I agree. I was pleasantly surprised to see the film to be pretty entertaining for around two thirds of the film. The first 20 minutes was Cars 2 level of bad the world looked boring and fantasy driven. The same stuff you've seen hundreds of times but wait guys there's a twist. The world it's set in with a weird cross between fantasy and the modern world (sarcastically claps). With the big brother Barley trying to reinvigorate the past but almost everyone wants to live with technology which makes no sense given that magic is... magic nevermind ignore the plot holes, let's just focus on the rest of the film. They lost their dad (not a spoiler it happened before the film even starts) before Ian Lightfoot (the little brother) was born. Moving on we get introduced to the actual magic of the film magic staff brings bad half the dad (it's in the trailer) yada yada yada our Boys are on a journey to a Manticore cavern that's basically the Chuck E Cheese of Pixar's universe. Our shy protagonist goes full Morgan Freeman and tells her that she needs to go back to the good old days the uncivilized ways (It's like The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn except Ian isn't a lying prick). We get our EPIC location for the film's Ravenpoint, side note Ocatavia Spencer is the best actress in the film she was funny while bringing life to a manticore.Alright we got the basic premise down. I think it was alright so far, but by Pixar's standards it was as bad as the Cars franchise and The Good Dinosaur but luckily for us the film turns into a Buddy Brothers film. The dragon at the end of the film was horrific (not in a good way), the way it was designed made me think that Pixar wasted it's entire budget on the rest of the film and by hiring Chris Pratt and Tom Holland as the main characters (must've cost 50 million). It knocked down my rating of the film but the Pixi Bikers, dancing and walking on an invisible bridge scene were great with the invisible bridge being the best scene in the film well apart from the ending (which I won't spoil). I kinda wish there was a romance in the film because I could've seen a hot blue alien chick. Onward isn't even close to the top of the Pixar ladder but it's nowhere near the bottom. I liked the film and there's something in it for anyone with a sibling like me (I'm the older brother by the way). My recommendation is watching Coco then Soul then Onward if you're binging Pixar films about dealing with death.",Onward
186,careybrandon-41144,The animation is incredible,8,11 April 2020,"This movie is pretty good, but not a top 10 Disney Pixar animated movie.

And while Onward is certainly a good movie with spectacular animation, a decent plot and a knockout ending, the rest of the film feels strangely controlled and contained. It feels like there's a potential masterpiece here that's trapped in the confines of a good movie. The jokes worked for the most part and I'd say that Pixar's comedy has definitely improved overtime, but the rest of the film just doesn't feel traditionally Pixar. I didn't go in expecting to compare it to films like The Incredibles and Toy Story, but was still underwhelmed. The characters are fine and the voice cast do a good job, and the plot manages to function without much fault, but there is so much potential with this idea and this kind of film specifically that just isn't fully realised. I will say however, hear me out, that the ending is one of the best endings to a Pixar movie I have ever seen. It's fantastic, and if the previous acts of the movie kept up with that kind of quality then this would be one of my favourite Pixar films, without a shadow of a doubt.",Onward

By the end of the movie, you will find the characters endearing, experience their perilous journey and carry their burden too. But more than anything, the story will move you to tears.

189,hooma814,A little over hyped but still good,7,10 March 2020,"This movie has been some high reviews. Pixar's best movie of 2020. 5 stars reviewed all over. A must see movie from the makers of Coco and Toy Story. Well that sounds epic. Why not?But the movie does not live up to the high expectations set by the never ending 5 star ratings given out across all the advertising. Not all the movies can be 5 stars right? But is it worth seeing if its 4 stars? 3 stars definitely not. So it really seems like there are only two categories amazing movies the you must see at 5 stars or just ok movies at 4stars.It seems like very polarized categories of 1 star or 10 stars. Both categories I've never actually seen a movie worthy of being either. Do actually truly believe this movie is worth 10 stars, faultless? Maybe I'm a bit more like old school Simon Cowell in this sense, theres always room to improve. Where as I've seen some absolutely shocking movies and 1 star really? Is there nothing redeemable about it. This is months of work and thousands of dollars. Is it still not worth a few stars? The system seems rigged for people to try and bring down or up the overall rating. Regardless I try to give my open and honest thoughts of what I think the movie actually deserves.This movie is funny, great animation and a warm fuzzy overall message of grieving the loss of family members and the importance of loving those around you.It was not the best Pixar movie I've seen. The soundtrack was forgettable. I cant even remember it. But the brothers were great fun and bringing out quite a bit of emotion towards the end. This is a great movie to watch. Not needed to see it at the movies but still worth watching when it comes out on streaming services.",Onward

191,ajzeg,PAINFULLY Average,6,14 May 2020,"When I first heard about this movie, I was really excited. It's the first movie in Pixar's new initiative to focus only on original films once again. That, and I like the idea behind the movie. What if a Lord of the Rings-esque fantasy world progressed into the modern era with technology? I know there was that Netflix movie Bright with the same idea, but that movie sucked. I expected that Pixar would do something a lot more interesting with the idea and tell a better story with it. However, and it pains me to say this, but this movie is not very good. It's not a terrible movie by any means, but by Pixar standards this is definitely on the bottom half of their filmography. First of all, the universe this movie takes place in it not very interesting. It's literally just a modern setting that just happens to be inhabited by fantasy creatures. There were some interesting ideas, like fantasy RPGs being based on history, but there weren't really any interesting design choices and it doesn't feel very well thought-out. I can't help but compare Onward to Zootopia, another animated film that takes place in an alternate universe, in which animals evolved and became civilized. In that movie, every detail of the world was fleshed out. There was real thought and attention to detail given to this world and how it would function with its different-sized inhabitants. There's nothing like that in Onward. The comedy did not work for me at all. I never laughed once. The writing and dialogue just isn't that great. Also, one of the main characters is a disembodied pair of legs. It was an interesting idea, but I don't feel like the character was expressive enough and I don't feel like he had enough of a connection with the other two main characters when he really should, he's their resurrected dead father. He's treated like a prop half the time. The story felt very repetitive and way too familiar. I feel like I've seen something like it in a million other movies. As for the animation, it's fine. It's appealing and colourful and energetic, but nothing about it stood out or felt like it was pushing the boundaries of technology. Personally, I thought Toy Story 4 looked a lot better. Even some of the Pixar SparkShorts on Disney+ look more impressive. Releasing the trailer for Pixar's next movie Soul before this movie was a big mistake. The animation in that looks a million times better and more interesting. The voice acting was also fine, but I have to say I'm getting pretty sick of Chris Pratt and Tom Holland. They're in everything! Give some other actors a try! Not every movie needs to have a Marvel actor in it! Give it a rest! Now, believe it or not, there actually is one thing that I really enjoyed about this movie and think is very well-done, the third act. Without giving anything away, all the creativity, emotion and heart that you would expect out of a Pixar movie can be found in the third act. It has a really great climax, some great character moments and a great message. If the whole movie were more like act three, I would have liked it a lot more than I did. However, I can't really give the movie any extra credit if it only starts getting really good at the end. As for my recommendation, well, if you're a Pixar fan you've probably already seen it. I actually highly recommend that you show it to your kids. I don't think the unoriginal story or worldbuilding issues would bother them and it does have a really good moral. There's a lot in it for kids to like. As for older audiences, if you're a fan of Tolkien or D&D you might get some enjoyment out of it. Otherwise, you could watch it if you're curious, it's on Disney+, but I say skip it and wait for Soul. It really doesn't appeal to adults in the same way that most of Pixar's other movies do. Man, what is up with Disney lately? It seems ever since Ralph Breaks the Internet, they haven't been able to make many good non-Marvel movies. All those remakes, Frozen II, The Rise of Skywalker and now Onward, among others, have not been up to Disney's usual quality. But who cares about quality when you have all the money? Damn shame.",Onward

195,shimenpf,What a beautiful movie,8,11 March 2020,"I've seen people consider this a 'meh' movie. That's alright. For me, it did resonate a lot, I am not entirely sure why that is, but it took me to the verge of tears at least a couple times. The movie is engaging, the world-building is superb, original and interesting, the conflict is constant, so the movie never feels dull or too long in my opinion.Ian's arc is very solid. He goes from a shy, coward kid that just wants to meet his father to a man that is willing to take risks and sacrifice himself. All feels justified through his adventure with his brother. Similarly, his relationship to his brother has an arc itself, and that is emotive as well.There were at least three scenes that were particularly memorable for me: when Ian and his brother turn into their stepfather to get rid of the cops (this was a great way of showing that Ian doesn't believe in his brother), when Ian crosses the invisible bridge, and Barley has to keep him going even when the rope is gone, and when Barley sacrifices his van. Oh, and, naturally, the climax scene were Ian decides to sacrifice himself to let Barley have just a few seconds more with their father. The way the story manages the Ian's learning, his dilemma and his final decision is excellent. There is urgency as the dragon is attacking them and there is emotion as Ian decides to sacrifice the chance to meet his father. I really enjoyed this movie and, again, it was a very emotional experience for me.",Onward

It has offered some touching moments when we see Ian and Barley spending time with their dad, but only has one day to see him. I won't spoil anything, but it gotten more heartwarming towards the end. The movie also includes nice animation and some enjoyable characters. So overall, it may not be Pixar's most magical movie, it's just an enjoyable film.",Onward

This was a good movie. It definitely isn't on the same level for me as ""Up"" or ""Coco"" or ""Wall-E,"" but it was good enough to add to my film encyclopedia. Tom Holland and Chris Pratt has some very good chemistry in this film. The quest that they embark on is a fun one, however, there's was nothing in particular that pulled at my heart strings in this one. Pixar is the master when it comes to getting you in your feels and although I did enjoy the connection the two brothers were building on their adventure, I didn't get that same Pixar feel. I also didn't laugh as much in this film as I have in others. Don't get me wrong, there were funny moments in this film, but nothing I'll remember for years to come as I have with a lot of their previous films. Maybe I'm comparing this film to Pixar's previous too much, but I do believe they have set a standard for themselves where if they don't reach that high bar, it doesn't connect with me as much as I'd like. So in the end, this is a good, fun movie that audiences will ultimately enjoy, I just don't think it'll be in anyone's top 5 top Pixar films. 6.5/10.",Onward
198,quiqueperezsoler,Half-baked promising premise that doesn't quite stick the landing. It'll speak more to those who have felt the same loss as the protagonists.,7,11 March 2020,"From the Trolls-inspired characters and world design to the depth-lacking world-building, this movie attempts to set a well-realised heartfelt story of brotherly love and fantasy adventure in a world that feels small and undiscovered. It fails to use the world to aid the story like other movies like ""Shrek"" and ""Monsters, Inc."" excelled at.This is perhaps the kind of movie that now I feel is a bit underwhelming but which, in time, I'd feel different about. Because it definitely has themes and aesthetic choices I understand and like inspired by the Fantasy genre. But there are many small narrative and plot choices, I feel, damage what could have been the perfect uplifting grieving story for a younger audience. I felt similarly about PIXAR's Brave. I love the animation and aesthetic of Scotland and Celtic Mythology, but there's no denying that the story is quite conventional and not that groundbreaking PIXAR is used to be known for. However, I will say the stories of these are filled with emotion and are original and very creative, something I always value more in a movie. I'd take a character-study-heavy movie over the best-plot-but-with-boring-characters movie any time. Characters are the vehicle with which we experience the story, so they come to be a very important aspect of it. However, I feel like this one will speak more to those who have grown up without a dad or who have lost their parents at some point and always wanted to see them again. Which unfortunately isn't my case, so I do feel the emotion behind but I know people who have been in that situation and told me this movie spoke more to them.The story, characters and premise fall a bit flat in an otherwise enticing idea of rediscovering magic in a civilised modern world. The potential subplots where there, so much could have been reimagined and used to serve the overall plot, but we never see the extent of this world. We are left wondering how the world became so bored of magic, why because they discovered electricity they don't need magic anymore? Couldn't magic create more renewable electricity? I mean, after all, it's magic. I suppose it comes down to what the literary people call ""the magic system"". PIXAR movies are always so well thought out, like the fact that the powers of the Incredibles were representations of their personalities. But here, we only get overly exaggerated characterizations of emotions we have seen done better before by THEM (Inside Out). Many side characters lack a very much needed depth covered by a simple line that can define their purpose of being. The subplot of the mom and the Manticore woman serve nothing to the plot and the world seemed smaller than it should have because the two brothers kept running into the already introduced characters (cops and fairies). Despite how the movie takes advantage of DnD and other Fantasy tropes to set and move the story forward, it never made use of it for the fear of falling into cliche plot devices. What was that final boss? Really?So much could have been done but it decided to go a common route with an emotionally infused quest. It just felt PIXAR was going to finally ""break the mold"" and end the story differently but it seemed like the movie got scared when it needed to be brave. This movie is receiving a 7 because I'm not an idiot, animated movies are oriented primarily to kids and this movie will speak more to them as it tackles themes that they might be dealing with or can relate more directly with. And I can see that value in the movie, but compared to other PIXAR movies it felt as half-baked as The Good Dinosaur, like if the ""B Team"" was the one in charge of this one because the ""A team"" was working on their other upcoming movie Soul.When I saw the trailer I knew something was off, the premise was very vague but I thought, after seeing the ""decent"" rating (7.5 back then) that maybe it had some surprises and tricks under its sleeve, but I was wrong in a way. The movie delivered a fun, entertaining adventure movie but the big moments and scenes were spoiled in the trailers so it left very little to the imagination. Unlike the trailer for the movie Soul, which hasn't come out yet and don't know if it'd be good, but it sets the story without spoiling anything about the plot, other characters or funny interactions, just conveyed what the movie would be about and leaving out the rest of the experience.IN CONCLUSION, the movie is fine average emotionally-charged adventure movie with little room for rewatchability potential as the first time you see it you learn the general message of the movie. And that's just the thing, the biggest fault of this movie is that it creates and entire new world with a lot of potential but it doesn't fully exploit it. Perhaps in the future sequels it will. It just feels like if the world was created for the characters and it didn't feel like the characters were living in this world. They barely interact with anybody other than the recurring few that are there just for a minute or lack relevance to the story and serve just as comedy. I recommend this as a family movie but if you are a big PIXAR animation fan this one is down with The Good Dinosaur in its ranking. Which is not a bad thing, is just that the movie could have benefited with more ""time in the oven"".UPDATE 2020 -- after a second rewatch -- WARNING SPOILERS FROM NOW ON

the ""DND and Fantasy"" references -- from the ""stop dragon, go back to your layer"" interchanging the version of dogs in our world for dragons to the fact that this movie's equivalent to DnD is based on their ""real past history"", it is delightfully charming. The magic is REAL magic, from the enchantations to the magical creatures. It brings a sense of bewonderment every time magic comes into play. It is perhaps a great Magic casting movie. Especially the quest itself in the cave, gaining the values that are so characteristic and prevalent in all fantasy stories like valor, belief in one's self and work together to achieve a goal.Just the main two characters -- especially Chris Pratt's with this angle of him being the ""believer"" but the screw up sort of.The World-building -- from Zootopia's sort of antromorphism like when the horse policeman laughs like a horse; to the smart fact that when electricity and other more convenient inventions of non-magic people appeared, the magic began to fade away. Unfortunately, the story decides that only the ""gifted"" people can use magic and this renders the world-building a bit unencouraging. Long are the days of ""the chosen ones"" and they seemed to have ""the-Force-prequels-reimagined"" it, that is, instead of allowing the Force to be in all of us it decided to have it more present in some than others.Character moments -- from the tape recorder conversation to the kid's realisation when reading the list of things he wants to do with his dad of who has really ""raised"" himCONS:
The mom and the manticore -- WHY? Why are the parents so overprotective? If there's been a sequence that proved the danger of the ""outside world"" perhaps it'd have made more sense for them to worry, but they don't. So it comes across as overprotective in a quest movie, which is the most annoying thing you can have in an adventure movie. it just feels like they were forced in to have a ""female presence"". I personally would much rather have the main characters be the wimpy teenage girl as Ian and a tomboy as the bro rather than having an unnecessary subplot with the mom and manticore that if taken away the movie doesn't change at all.Plot Conveniencies and cheap decisions -- like the water-proof cheeto, really? In the final battle, how did the mom and manticore know where the kids were, I thought the cop bf told her they were going out to the mountains. Also, how is the mom able to sneak past the rubble dragon? Seriously, some things in this movie are, well, unbelievable. And when he defeats the dragon none of the rocks that fall on the protagonist crushes him? I mean if you didn't wanted to kill him, don't make the decision of making the rubble fall on top of him. It's a dramatic choice that serves no purpose, let the rubble fall over the nearby cliff where the dragon was actually closer to. Now, I know it was meant to have a reason so that the kid doesn't make it to see his dad, but still, it feels cheap. Also, it seems the rest of the characters like the mom and brother don't seem to care that their loved on has been crushed by rubble because they are just too ""in the moment"" when the dad appears, which makes sense but it's just awkward because we never get to see the conversation the dad and bro have, we stay with the kid. And I respect and value that creative decision, is just that it feels a bit uncharacter-wise given how both have been the entire movie worrying about him and now that he is really in danger, well, it can wait for this emotional moment.The final battle, this is where it doesn't stick the landing -- aside from everything explained previously which took place here, after all the fantasy elements of magic and myth, a monster made out of rubble. really? That's the big terrible curse that spanned an entire subplot with the mom and manticore? Also, it can spit fire like a dragon... Why not use a REAL massive dragon then? Is like the audience want to be immersed in and have been enjoying this classic fantasy setting for the entire movie, but it denies that ""cherry on top"" of the quest by makign the ""final boss"" be a creature born in this new modern world. It kinda robs the movie of the message of ""modern world is boring and monotonous, the old world was wonderful and adventurous"" the movie was striving towards. Nevertheless, I understand the ending has more to do with the emotional ending that really the fantastical one, but still, they could have done it better.",Onward

200,ernestsavesxmas,A surprising delight,9,11 March 2020,"The emotional hits in this aren't forced or cliched, and that's perhaps the highest praise one can bestow onto a kids movie, especially a Pixar movie wherein those elements can feel forced if not gratuitous. In fact, the true emotional arch is disguised for much of the film. This film both made me cry and surprised me! Also, there are several other thematic undercurrents at play, from the presence and/or lack of magic in one's everyday life to the power of believing in yourself. And on top of that, it hits all the usual comedic beats in the midst of some really creative action and tremendous world-building. It's a shame that this is underperforming because I would love to see some additions to this fantastical realm. What more can you ask for from a kids movie?",Onward

202,willians_franco,Poor Pixar animation,5,28 July 2020,"Pixar animation. This information alone foreshadows quality in computer graphics. As for the story, I thought it was bad. The creators tried to mix medieval characters from the enchanted kingdom (with fairies, dragons, etc.) with the daily life of modern times. In my opinion, that chemistry didn't work.

205,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Onward and Upward Toward Aight,6,7 March 2020,"Welcome backeth to the mystical movie review siteth of the new decade, Stream To Big Screen! This quest will lead us down the path of peril to end up at our ultimate goal, a review of Onward. Onward was a movie about two brothers on a one of a kind journey to find a gem that will help them complete a spell that will give them 24 hours with their deceased father. There were pitfalls and pixies along the dangerous way. Are you, brave soul, up to the challenge?Ok, enough of the dungeons and dragons talk. Onward is a movie presented by the pairing of Disney and Pixar. Typically, the Disney/Pixar duo makes magic on the cinematic screen. Thus, Onward had a high bar to overcome. Viewers will expect the likes of an Up, Toy Story franchise, or even, Coco; but Onward cannot compare. I say that to say, the lower the expectations of this movie the better it will be going into it. Onward, led by Tom Holland, as Ian Lightfoot, and Chris Pratt, as Barley Lightfoot, is just a solid but typical pre-teen odyssey movie. Now, the two mentioned previously do a pretty good job of carrying the movie, Pratt more than Holland. Barley is exactly how I'd picture Pratt as a young adult. Holland, on the other hand, was less inspiring, more of just a voice than a believable character. That may have been the writing or it might be Holland's deliver. Unfortunately, Pixar and the writers didn't take any risks in the writing or storylines of this movie. Don't get me wrong, I love a good brotherly love excursion but the envelope wan't pushed enough.Aside from that, the cast as whole did a pretty good job. Shout to Octavia Spencer for stealing the movie! What the movie did well is a little comedy and the overall animation. First, we all have come to love Pixar's animation, that's an obvious; however, it was the depiction of disabled creatures, clothing, movement of characters, and re-imagination of modern life that really was enjoyable. Oh, yeah, and the movie did have my neighbor and I bust out laughing at two parts (no really kid laughter though).Sadly, Onward is not my favorite Pixar movie. The things that make this movie succeed does not outweigh the basic, uninspired plot. The disappointment may be due to the expectations based on Pixar's past successes, but it didn't translate here. Onward is a strong bowl of popcorn during a family movie night (I would understand a matinee for the kids but parents won't get their monies worth).",Onward
206,helenbassett,Disney Pixar Onward Film Review - Dan Scanlon Directs Chris Pratt & Tom Holland On A Boy's Own Adventure In A Time Without Magic,10,30 March 2020,"I saw Disney Pixar's Onward when it opened this month at the movies, now streaming it was described potentially as Frozen for boys. And there are no pretty Disney princesses in Dan Scanlan's quest, nothing is pretty, not even the feral unicorns. Chris Pratt & Tom Holland are blue elf brothers living in a land where as technology has advanced, the need for magic has reduced. Policemen centaurs drive around town, instead of feeling the wind in their hair galloping at 70mph, light is provided by electricity, you get the idea, and Gandalf is out of a job. Dragons make good trained house pets though. Small ones anyway.Chris Pratt's Barley Lightfoot is let's say a bit of a doofus. I'm sure his younger brother Ian voiced by Tom Holland would agree. Like everyone in New Mushroomton, Barley is a squib - non magical. But he loves the old ways, plays the equivalent of Dungeons and Dragons, saves mythical old monuments and his clapped out old van is even called Guinevere, riffing on the days of Yore. Chris must have had a hoot with his character.Ian lacks a father figure since his father died when he was a baby, he's always felt insecure and carries around a checklist of things he still wants to achieve. If he only had the courage. As his 16th birthday approaches he is even too timid to ask his friends to the party. But Barley is there for him. His memories of Dad are all Ian knows. Except for a recording Ian has of his Dad that he sweetly knows by heart. And now it's time for Barley to anoint Ian a man. Not so fast there Barley, Ian isn't into all the old ways loved by his embarrassing older brother and his Quest of Yore role playing game. But Julia Louis-Dreyfus's Mum has something special for both the boys now they are 16. Turns out their accountant dad was into magic too and the gift is a wizard's magical staff. Plus matching Phoenix jewel to cast a visitation spell to bring him back to life for one more day.And with learned magic coursing through his veins, brave fearless warrior Barney prepares to weald the mighty staff...and nothing happens. But when weedy Ian takes the staff it's abracadabra, as the spell backfires and a half body with just legs magically appears. But how the hell are they to get the rest of dad materialised before the day is done? Looks like Barley's magical knowledge might come in useful after all, as Ian reluctantly follows him. Leaving a message for Mum, with high kicking Dad in disguise trailing along behind.Let's start with fire breathing Octavia Spencer as The Manticore, folklore tells she has a map to another jewel in her tavern lair. But her lair is now a family dining 'The Tavern' restaurant with tricks and karaoke. But on the wall is the map, unfortunately Manticore inadvertently sets it on fire. But our elves manage to grab a paper kids menu 'map' that gives some clue to the treasure, just as the restaurant burns. In the interest of Health & Safety no-one is hurt. Except maybe Manticore's pride.Onward is a blast with the Lord of the Rings style quest, biker pixies and Lena Waithe's policewoman cyclops, Officer Spector if you please, gets a girlfriend. She co-wrote it so not so much a surprise, but I still did a double take. Kids who live in countries with much stricter laws on sexuality will really miss out on the fun here. Director Dan Scanlan who wrote the film in relation to the loss of his own father early in his life, creates emotions that are heartfelt but not in a mawkish way. There's plenty of comedy, vibrant animation and dad dancing hilarity in the boys own adventure. Even the character names are amusing with Officer Spector and Officer Bronco.A magical gem of good honest fun that helps you realise that what you were looking for all along was in quite the most unexpected place.",Onward
207,harishmadireddi,Certainly One Time Watchable.,8,15 October 2020,"Few of the scenes holds you till the end and the treasure hunt keeps us intriguing throughout. The car had the character and had this been a feature film the actor for brother character would have won the hearts of many because his character was so well written for eg. inspite of getting bashed by his brother, he keeps trying for what he believed in. The bridge scene was so interesting and lovely the way the younger one crosses it. Its worth of a proper feature film. Finally it silently leaves us with a alarming message that we all are born and were best at something more physically but the invention made us lazy to recongnize the skill we carry within.",Onward
208,JCinHB,A good movie w/o all the Politically Correct junk,6,18 January 2021,"A Disney movie about adventure, learning & family with a magic frosting. Good for the whole family without all the PC junk that Disney just can't stay away from these last few years.",Onward
209,acdc_mp3,An entertaining movie with some dark humor and D&D dorkism,8,5 April 2020,"We watched it tonight and I was fully expecting to not enjoy it as I have with other CGI animated movies as of late. As soon as I got the strong D&D vibe from it, I immediately began enjoying it as my son, who is now grown and married, is a complete D&D dork. He is currently the DM of the D&D quest we have been on for over a year, so yeah, I guess I am a D&D geek as well.
If you have children that are easily scared, this may not be the movie for them as there is dark humor, which did create several good belly laughs for us, and slightly macabre moments that could freak out the weak of heart.
The story seems to jump around a bit and seems rushed at times to fit it into certain time frame, but it doesn't take too much away from the movie.
All in all a worth while watch that will tug at your emotions as well.",Onward
210,Clank_Zoka,Fun and Magically-Endearing!,10,1 March 2020,"Oh... a original Pixar film?, well it's about time, the last original film was the wonderful Coco!, I absolutely adore the heck of that film, with this one, they got Monsters University Director Dan Scanlon to direct this new original film, which seems to have this Witchcraft and Wizardry look to it, I am so far on board and even with some big names like Tom Holland and Chris Pratt, this could be another extremely great original Pixar film!, the trailers while left me a bit doubtful over this plot, I was still excited to see what Pixar can bring to this subject matter!, but Disney and Pixar was nice enough to release this early on the 29th of February which is Leap Day or as Pixar calls it ""Onward Day"", which gives me a chance to see this film a week early, so yeah I saw it and..... yeah I did really like it, although it doesn't quite hit all the marks that makes it... well... a Pixar classic, but there is a lot to talk about, so let's talk about it.This magical and enhancing world was full of magic and wonder, but since the times and period changes, the world uses less magic and relies more on modern day technology like phones, tumble dryers, computers, you name it, so in this modern urban fantasy world, two Lightfoot brothers Ian (Tom Holland) and Barley (Chris Pratt) set off on this quest after bringing their Dad back.... well sort of..., it's only the bottom part of his body, so they both have to go on adventure in one day to bring the rest of him back before sunset, while that's going on, Laurel (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) goes out to find them along with the fearsome Manticore named Corey (Octavia Spencer), so it's basically like a buddy road trip film only the two buddies are brothers, which gives the concept something more then world building, the world is so interesting and unique that i wanted to see more of this awesome world, we do get that just not that much, it's mainly focused on Ian and Barley trying to bring the rest of their Dad back before sunrise, which is both suspenseful and interesting, it is also relatable specially in the first 10/15 minutes, the film hasn't got the strongest humour from Pixar but still quite funny and very clever also, especially slapstick ad visual gag humour with Walden Lightfoot, it does have it's fair share of emotional scenes, although well done not quite as powerful as most of Pixar's other films, it still shows it's heart and it's theme of brotherhood is super strong along with some great Son and Father Bonding, with the use of the father's bottom half, also without giving anything away, the ending is actually excellent and quite sweet, now that's great and all but... I'm afraid the weakest part of the film is the story, it replies heavily on cliches and predicable moments, like there it'll a scene that'll involve some explanation and the two main characters arguing and both go their spectate ways in order to return together in the climax, no that's not really a spoiler, it's in like 90% to 95% of these Pixar films, yes the others films had cliches, but you never thought of them, they take advantage of the cliche and they use it to tell the story in a unique and different, this film is on the right track, but it just needed to execute these moments a lot more differently, but besides that, I mean Scanlon did a much better job at directing with this then he did with Monsters University, this film has the better comedy, Better drama, better relatability, better well told-ish story and at least I wasn't bored or frustrated, it was very entertaining, however with 20% of the humour being quite juvenile and not that funny and with how unoriginal the story is, this magical journey could of been a lot better then it already is.The animation continues the path of improving and making the animation feel as real as possible, this is no exception, the characters has this distinct design where it's a blend of cartoony and smooth designs, a lot of them look great like the elves, gnomes, manticore, goblins, trolls, you name it, the film is also gorgeous to look at, the backgrounds look unbelievable, Pixar continues to have some real looking environments and areas, I like how they blend modern elements with fantasy elements, like with the houses that are mushrooms, the Manticore's Tavern is in a dark forrest making it look like a haunted house from the outside, there is so much details like that, it's quite nice and refreshing to see all these used to their advantage, the scenes that involve Ian learning how to use magic is visually spectacular, the chase scenes and what eventually happens in the third act all pay off in terms of animation, it's big, epic, it's used every sort of magic to make it feel like it belongs in it's own world, there isn't much I can say about the animation, it's just another fantastic and visually stunning look film with a great style to it also, I'm glad Pixar continues to make their animation big and grand as ever.The characters are fairly entertaining, the two main characters are very relatable and funny, Ian is the best character in the film, he's socially awkward, he's shy, he wants to achieve a lot of things in life and he also wanted to do so much with his Dad, Ian is a very endearing character who I really enjoyed in this film, same can be said about Barley, he's full of optimism and since he is the older brother of Ian, he can easily get into trouble and he knows a lot about magic despite the fact that magic is no longer used anymore, he was pretty funny and his brother chemistry with Ian is sweet, funny, lovely and just feels real, their mother Laurel is a great supporting character who looks out for the two brothers as their mother, Corey the Manticore is also a great supporting character, she is funny, she is fearsome, I like that she is working at the tavern to try and get as many positive ratings as possible!, it's funny how they make this big fearsome and terrifying Manticore a waitress, she is very entertaining, Colt Bronco (Mel Rodriguez) is a likeable cop who happens to be the boyfriend of Laurel, he does have a few hilarious scenes and while there is technically no villain, he only looks out for the boys for their safety then just be the bad guy, as for Officer Specter (Lena Waithe) and Gore (Ali Wong) they are only there for one scene and also to cause controversy, although the Pixie Fairy Bike gang is legit great and hilarious! (seriously look it up!, it's pretty ridiculous..), the rest are just in the background for a joke or just giving a bit of explanation, however as for the voice acting, it's really fantastic!, everyone play their roles extremely well, Tom Holland still has the same accent that he uses for Peter Parker and Walter Beckett, but can still bring a great performance!, Chris Pratt is awesome as always whenever he voices a character, only instead of Emmet Brickowski it's Barley, Octavia Spencer as Corey is probably her funniest role yet, she really gets into her role as this fearsome Manticore, she is hilarious, over-the-top and best of all, she is awesome!, of course you can't have a Pixar film without their lucky charm John Ratzenburger, as for Lena Waithe and a Ali Wong, despite only appearing in the film for not that long, they are also great and funny just like most of the characters in the film, the characters do offer some great entertainment, even if it's Ian and Barley and their bonding, Laurel's loving and caring passion and Corey's wacky and bizarre personality, or even the police, but the voice acting does make all these characters great!, the world is magical but these character can certainly cast a good spell!.Mychael and Jeff Danna's score is beautiful as always, although I prefer the Good Dinosaur score, this score is also just as gorgeous and easy to listen to, but what I love even more then the score is the song from Brandi Carlile called ""Carried Me and You"", it's such a beautiful and well sung song with lovely lyrics and great atmosphere with it's acoustic guitar, if you haven't listened to it!, I highly recommend it!.Well... it's good to see another original Pixar film... however it's still not quite as original as I thought it would, Onward is another Pixar that is entertaining and funny!, it has a great concept, the animation gets better and more creative, the characters are really likeable along with two believable brothers, the voice acting is top notch and the music is easy and nice to listen to, however it suffers from a original story that replies on a lot of cliches and predicable moments, sometimes there is a not-so-funny moment here and there and sometimes there are characters who act as obstacles more then characters and the directing while better still feels like just... another basic Pixar film, this is far from a terrible movie, in fact I quite like this film, although it quite one of the greatest Pixar films, I'd say it'a in the same league as Good Dinosaur and Cars 3 where they are not amazing but they are great in their own way!, although my rating may change since I will be seeing it again to find some Easter Eggs and hopefully try and get into the film more then I have originally, but since it's not out until next week, I'll just have to wait till then, but for now, I do recommend this to Pixar fans and families, just don't expect anything on the levels of Toy Story, the Incredibles, WALL-E, Ratatouille, Inside Out, etc, etc, but.... I am saving all my hopes and praise for Soul and i really want that one to be the next Pixar original classic, but that's not out until June but for now, go see Onward, when it's out of course!.I'm going to give Onward on my first viewing a 9.7/10, but now that I have seen it a second time, I actually got into a lot more then originally, it's still not one of the Best Pixar films but it is fantastic!, more emotional (with a few tears) it was actually more funnier and the flaws I had with it are ignored, so it now gets a 10/10!.",Onward

217,Diablo1616,Onward Is A Bit Disappointing,8,22 April 2020,"When it comes to the announcement of a new release from Pixar, it's pretty safe to say that it's easy to become ecstatic. Over the years, the studio has consistently proven themselves to be true masters of blending mind-blowingly beautiful animation and equally brilliant storytelling. So, needless to say, like most Pixar fans, I was beyond excited to see ONWARD. So, was it worth the wait?To be honest, it's tough not to compare ONWARD to the studio's earlier works. While this film does contain many elements that have made the studio what they are, including sublime animation and character designs, as well as some wonderfully creative ideas and humor - for me, the overall package was rather tame and somewhat uninspired - something I didn't think I would say about a Pixar film.My biggest criticism is that there were so many underdeveloped ideas that felt as if the writers had been constantly juggling them, and like kids playing in a giant sandbox, eventually just threw those ideas aside, leaving several characters' arcs unfulfilled (Julia Louis-Dreyfuss was definitely terrific, but seriously underused) and the potential for a much bigger emotional and thematic punch felt brushed aside. While ONWARD does carry a few moments of genuinely quiet power, those moments are often overshadowed by the film's constantly manic tone. The concept of Ian and Barley's ""half-conjured"" father is pretty hilarious, but it's surprisingly poorly executed here.Now, don't get me wrong, ONWARD is not a complete disaster. Far from it. I have to admit that there were moments that even my own inner cynic couldn't help but be drawn into this world. As I stated before, the animation is so vivid and beautiful, and there are some genuinely funny moments. Younger kids will surely get a kick out of this colorful world, particularly with the brilliant character designs (I especially loved the giant ears on the elves) and will no doubt have a blast.The cast here is also put to good use, particularly with Tom Holland as Ian, who is celebrating his 16th birthday when we first meet him, and a showstopping Octavia Spencer as ""Manticore."" While definitely a great idea for the role of Ian's brother, Barley, Chris Pratt's character felt more like a nuisance than anything else. That may have been the idea, but for me, it was far too over-the-top, and occasionally, downright annoying. Thankfully, that wasn't always the case, and Pratt does manage to give Barley some genuine heart.Overall, ONWARD can be a pretty fun ride, and as is always the case with Pixar, it's a visual masterpiece. But those expecting a film along the lines of TOY STORY or UP, may find themselves feeling a bit underwhelmed.",Onward
218,adamstommy,Beautiful Masterpiece.,10,29 February 2020,"This is another one of Disney/Pixar's magical movies. I am so in love with Onward! The animation is top notch and the casting was perfect! The story, as most other Pixar films, pulls at your heart strings. I highly recommend watching it! It doesn't disappoint!",Onward
219,Lost_In_Translation_,Mid-tier Pixar is still better than most,6,6 March 2020,"For a while there Pixar could do no wrong. They had critical darling one after another. Cars 2 showed us that the studio was not without fault. Then Monsters University and The Good Dinosaur showed us that Pixar surely did have different levels of quality creators within the studio.Onward isn't bad Pixar, though it isn't top tier either. It's just a fine Pixar movie. There's nothing particularly bad about it, the movie just felt lacking of that spark that makes most other Pixar movies instant classics.It's an enjoyable hour and a half with many funny moments and some heartfelt ones too.The creativity of mixing modern technology and advancements in a world of fantasy was neat. The details in making architecture with castle elements or shopping stores with magical themed storefronts is really creative. The Pixar creativity was at it's usual high quality.It's just the writing and the story that make this an middling movie. The story is really just a coming of age story with a few fun twists. The story with their mother and the manticore trying to catch up to them was funny, but kinda kept taking up more time than it needed.There's not really that much to criticize besides it just being an alright Pixar outing. It's well designed visually, but the story is just middle of the road. It's for sure better than the worst of Pixar like Cars 2 or The Good Dinosaur. It's even better than other similarly middling movies like Monsters U and Brave. Though middling Pixar is still leagues above Illumination or the non-Dragon/Panda DreamWorks movies.",Onward
220,Ingrouille181,A good movie,6,29 February 2020,"I've seen quite a lot of these types of movies. I've seen it with Chicken Little, 2016s movie Sing; a world with animals or magical beings living out the same reality and world as us. Onward has been one of the few movies I've been looking forward to in 2020; having Tom Holland and Chris Pratt in an animated movie is also a welcome surprise, they worked great in Infinity War, and they work great in this, they have very good chemistry.The movie tells the story of Ian (Holland) and his older brother Barley (Pratt) who live in a suburban world that was once filled with magic and sorcery, which over the course of centuries stopped depending on the wonders of magic and began living in towns and cities and living with electricity and all the joys our world does. But one day, a magic staff is left to the brothers by their recently deceased father, and after the brothers only succeed in bringing part of their father back (the legs) they only have 24 hours to find a magic crystal to restore their father whole.Like I said, Holland and Pratt work great. Ian is the shy, socially awkward teen and Barley is the impulsive, tough older brother, and you enjoy watching their relationship develop over the course of the movie. Our side characters include a Manticore who over the years has given up her past violent but heroic ways and used her time to run a family restaurant. We get a nice side story with her and Ian and Barley's mum Laurel. We also get to know Laurel's boyfriend Officer Colt, a centaur. The way the film depicts a fantasy world turned modern day industrialised city is good. We have schools, highways, vehicles. Two of my favourite things in the movie are dragons being pets just like dogs are, and a biker gang made up of pixies, it's a funny idea.Besides that though, I have a few problems with the movie. The movie has a lot of heart to it, and it's by no means bad at all, this is just something I've seen in a lot of young adult animated movies, and it always makes me remember How to Train your Dragon 1&2. Those movies are a lot of fun, but something that always makes them better than the majority of young adult animated stuff these days is that they include realistic consequences when the danger arrived. I doubted that anyone in this movie would die or be injured; the closest thing we get are a few splinters, that it. In How to Train your Dragon 2 one of the battles (spoilers) ends up with Hiccup's dad DYING, and it's a pretty unexpected and violent death. This movie is definitely for kids, but I feel like young adults watching this need more a wake up call to some of this kind of violence. Who knew that Dreamworks has more balls to do something like that then Disney and Pixar does.Overall though, this is a very good movie and uses magic and adventure in a very funny way. Definitely see this in cinemas while you can.",Onward

""Onward"" is a must-see for the whole family, both Pixar fans and people who want to see a movie with family bonding that has an honest tone and a sense of adventure!

Onward is as majestic and magical as it's setting with crisp animation, fluid chemistry from Pratt and Holland's respective characters and the overall heartfelt mannerism that's tugging the heart strings. Disney and Pixar continue to thrive on their original storytelling and cathartic tone and this film is no different.Mitchell Bulfin",Onward
233,ivo_shandor,Magical!,8,2 September 2020,"Pun intended, Onward is magical. Characters going on an epic quest, which I always love, with great visuals, heart, humor and soul. All the makings of an amazing Pixar movie. Check off another one to add to the ranks. Chris Pratt and Tom Holland are the best duo since Key & Peele, so funny, I could watch them go at it all day long. Julia Louise-Dreyfus plays an absolute treasure of a movie mom, and Octavia Spencer just keeps hitting the home runs. It's one big love letter to dads, moms, brothers, and Dungeons and Dragons. It's probably the best movie made of D&D, minus the lovable hamminess of Jeremy Irons. It's one of the funnier Pixar movies, and there's so much comedy gold to mine. Animation is amazing as always, and some great production design and art. You keep telling yourself you're not gonna cry at every Pixar movie, but it's still gonna happen regardless. The movie is amazing for building a world that you would want to live in. Everything I see makes me want to see a theme park world where I can dine at the Manticore Tavern. It's like a big present at Christmas time, wrapped with a lovely bow. In the immortals words of Indiana Jones, and in the true spirit of Dungeons & Dragons, it's fortune and glory, kid. Fortune and glory.",Onward

What an original concept, with incorporation of a D and D like game to help tell the beautiful story and along with a well written script and wonderful characters. Its almost impossible not to enjoy this film.
The story is genius and emotionally captivating, without spoiling much the film is about 2 brothers living in a fictional world with a history of magic and a present of civilization, who get a chance to bring back their father to life. The younger brother never met or knew his father and has spent his whole childhood wanting to. The older of the two lost his dad at a young age and spent his childhood looking after his younger brother. On this journey the younger brother begins to realize that he may not of had his dad but he was never without a father. Along this journey the two brothers bond together, laugh together and rediscover their friendship and their love of one another. The older brother teaches his brother his strength and develops his younger brothers love for himself. He becomes confident and strong, and the older brother gets closure with his father and finds his self worth.
Please watch this film! Enjoy the humor, the adventure and let the film captivate your body and mind. Best animated film in years.",Onward

I always thought thought it wouldn't feel like Pixar, and be kind of cringe... but I was wrong. This is actually extremely well made and has a great story with some emotional moments. I could've bet $1,000 that Ian would've gotten to meet his father at the end, but once again Pixar subverted the expectations and took the more mature and ""realistic"" route. Ik this movie is literally based on magic quests and I'm over here calling it realistic, but what I mean by that is that it wasn't a perfectly happy ending that made no sense and had no emotional impact. The ending of this did the exact opposite and made everyone feel sad. Huge surprise from Pixar, highly recommend.",Onward

Meh.I loved the idea of ""magic in modern day"". Remember movie 'bright'? It was god-awful. I really expected that this time i'll get what I needed and Pixar will nail it... But turns out.. I didn't feel much magic from it. The cliches were so painfully obvious that they literally stripped fun out of watching it. Don't take me wrong, those cliches were fine, but they Pixar throws them at you as an ogre would throw a bolder at some poor soul.Unfortunately if I were to point the greatest flaw of it: it was a kids-only movie.

239,legonerdy,It Made Me Feel Feelings,8,10 March 2020,"I promise this will be an objective review, but, before I get to that, I have to gush a bit. This movie touched me deeply. I have always had an amazing, close relationship with my brother - and sister for that matter - so, seeing the relationship between Burly and Ian unfold over the course of the movie and the impact it had on both of them was something very special to me. Compound that with the quest to find meaning and identity in a relationship with a father and you have a recipe for my emotional outpouring.As for the meat and potatoes, the movie was good. I dare say it was great. They managed to make a Cheeto raft feel organic and believable. Stating the same exposition in its entirety twice within the first twenty minutes of the movie and then ending on a modified version is certainly a detractor. That said, the world they constructed is one I can buy. As a writer, I myself have constructed a modernized idea of the world with magic. As such, I have every confidence in my critique of the world building, and every confidence in saying it was excellent. The characters were good, the jokes landed, and the parents are - gloriously - not inept.Summation: Pixar hit another inside-the-park homerun.",Onward
240,stjackson10,6/10,6,5 April 2020,"Another entry in Pixar's series of kids movies that aren't really for kids, Onward is what you may call, ""pretty good"" It's simple and straightforward, and pretty fast moving in its world-building which made it hard for me to build a relationship with the characters. I can't say it was very new or inventive, but even knowing I was being manipulated wasnt enough to stop the tears. It's unapologetically emotional on several different layers and I cannot imagine watching this having lost a father",Onward
241,warren-87235,Entertaining but Forced,6,13 August 2020,"I'm seeing a pattern with PIXAR movies now. Increasingly, the movies feel less about thinking up an interesting story, and more about picking some tear-jerking moment and then attempting to build a story around them.I'm all for a good tear-jerking moment or two, but those moments have to be earnt and come naturally. Whilst watching Onward, you can almost feel the script writers and director standing around you, begging for a single tear, or a sniffle. Unfortunately, they feel far less concerned about writing the story and the characters that get you there.That's not to say Onward is bad. It's entertaining enough, and there is the odd chuckle, but it never really comes to life. One of the other problems is the 'world' they have created. The idea of a fantasy world, full of fantasy creatures that have advanced to modern levels of technology, is a great concept but they do very little with it. For the most part, the story could have happened in our world with a small dash of magic.Zootopia is a prime example of doing this alternate universe well. It takes the concept of a world full of animals, but using contemporary levels of technology, then alters that world with logical extensions of 'what if?'. This makes for plenty of enjoyable 'skewed reality' jokes and metaphors. Onward pretty much misses most of those opportunities.For example, Onward's equivalent of Dungeons and Dragons... In our world, it is a fun way to imagine being in a fantasy realm. It should be the equivalent to their characters, flipped for a fantasy world. What would that be? Perhaps it would entirely lack magic, and be all about technology? Unfortunately, knowledge of magic from the game is a core feature required to move the plot along, which also lessens the need for us to actually BE in a fantasy world, rather than simply being in the normal world and enjoying the discovery that magic is real.Then there are simple touches... One humourous moment shows that unicorns have actually become more akin to vermin and wild dogs. This is one of the few genuinely funny moments. However, the brother's van is painted with a magical unicorn on the side, in the same way that an equivalent character in our world would have. It makes no sense. It would be like having a few scruffy rats or wild dogs painted on it, rather than something magical.Ultimately, the events unfold in a contrived way in order to 'force' the tear-jerking emotional moments and all-important 'life lessons'. As a result, rather than being an emotional road trip it's more of a bus ride with a few pleasant views, that gets you from A to B.",Onward

248,AnAverageNerd,Left every adult in tears,8,31 August 2020,"This film is one of Disney's most successful attempts at creating something for both children and adults but personally i feel this is definitely one for the adults. It follows the journey of a young boy and his older brother attempting to bring back their dad for a day as he passed when they were both young. The climax of this film is what takes it to the next level for me as it takes a turn which we as viewers don't expect but as someone who has a younger brother myself I'll admit it got me in the feels. My only criticism of the film is that the journey to the end itself is slightly dragged out meaning the tension it builds is lost slightly. This film is still a must see for Disney fans, lovers of cinema and all those in between.",Onward
249,Ryan_Barbakins,"An epic, emotional, and well-written Quest",8,16 March 2020,"Onward is a very delightful film. I found the ending and theme to be very emotional and relatable. Most of the enjoyment of the film comes from the exciting, interesting quest and emotion that glues it all together.
This film was a very big relief for Disney writing wise. Recently, they have failed to craft a story that felt natural and well rounded (ie: Rise of Skywalker, Frozen 2, and even a bit of Toy Story 4). Every little detail and line of dialogue comes back to serve a greater purpose by the end of the film such as all of the magic spells Barley teaches Ian, the piece of Gweniver that Barley keeps, and just about every single interaction between the two brothers.
The ending of the film is quite emotional especially if you have a brother. It explains what kind of a role an older brother plays for a younger brother. Being the youngest in my family with two brothers, I absolutely adored it.
My main criticisms of the film are that it can feel a little bit too formulaic for Pixar, and surprisingly there are very few funny jokes. I assumed that this film would be much more funny considering the main cast and the way it was marketed. I also wish that the emotion was a little more spread out. There was one scene at the beginning and then the entire ending.
Nonetheless, this film succeeds at being very entertaining and emotional.",Onward

255,kane_1371-117-231060,Easily the best Disney Pixar movie of the decade,10,26 June 2020,"Onward is such a beautiful story, so meticulously done, such a love letter to pen and paper rpgs, such heart warming movie that it is unlike anything recent Disney.
Disney normally follows a cookie cutter mold that basically makes all its movies identical.
So many of the Disney movies follow the same pattern since Disney renaissance that you could basically watch one and be as if you haved watched them all.
And Onward isn't different, Disney has done similar movies before, in fact the other one that immediately comes to mind was also about brotherly love, bear brothers instead of Elves.
But it has been long enough for Onward to feel extremely fresh and well timed.
Onward ditches the typical tropes in favor of a fast and concise adventure heavily themed around a magical world that has stopped using magic with the advance of technology (Damned muggles finally won, this is what happens when people like Wesleys get to have it their way) and two brothers and their family life at the eve of younger brother's 16th birthday.
I will not go in to spoilers as this is a work of art to be experienced by every person individually but what matters to me is the emphasis on the family and their importance in fulfilling needed roles in the absence of other people.
It just works so well, and the climax of the story is surprisingly unlike Disney, so unlike Disney that you are left wondering if you are watching something from the other companies that are not left in stagnation.
But then again between Frozen 2 and Onward Disney and in turn pixar might finally be willing to be variable every now and then to escape the monotonous feels of their movies.
We shall see.",Onward

263,Tony_Fresh_Reviews,Overall: Great,8,27 July 2020,"The only world that unicorns should truly be feared.What can I say, I'm a sucker for animated movies. Onward was funny, heartwarming, beautifully animated and filled with tons of magical moments. The movie will hit different for those who lost a parent/guardian or have a sibling they look up to. It does a great job balancing emotional moments with fun lighthearted moments. However, what holds the movie back was how generic or predictable it could be at times. Some of our characters have arcs you've scene a hundred times before, which is unfortunate when you know how the movie will end before it even starts. The magical world felt largely unexplored - we spend more time on side streets and gas stations than anywhere else. Despite some underwhelming elements, I was smiling my whole way through it and was won over by its magical charm.Recommended for: Fans of Pixar movies, fans of magical quests, or fans of a world like Lord of the Rings but with modern technology.",Onward

Several recurring Pixar film traits were once again visible which I would like to point out.1- An unprecedented and cool atmosphere which piques your interest from the beginning2- Strong, intense and teary emotional moments which will make you cry like a child (Pixar has been getting increasingly better at this in the past few years with ""Inside Out"" and ""Coco"". although on an emotional scale ""Onward"" was a step back but it was still good)3- Introducing a fantastic element which leads to innovative situations. (With this movie it was the strange uses the bottom half of a being was put to like holding down a button underwater or being immune to horizontal swinging axes. With ""The Incredibles 2"" It was Voyd with her portals. With ""Coco"" it was Hector's very interesting dilemma due to the film's take on death)4- The stellar, breath-taking animationOverall one of the better animated movies in the last few years.

269,grantpaulsen,Onward is Pixar's best film since Coco (2017),4,6 March 2020,"I've been saying for years now that I want Pixar to start making more original films rather than lazy sequels, and I think this is definitely a step in the right direction. The world and the characters are unique, the story is pretty basic, but is held up by the arcs of the two main characters. The bond between them and the arc they go through, definitely is what elevated this film to a higher level than most of the recent Pixar films. There were some genuinely sad moments, memorable lines as well as character building scenes. What dragged this film down was the underwritten subplot with the Manticore, as well as the third act final battle. Which was completely unnecessary, it kind of killed the tone, and the emotional catharsis of the story would've been even more impactful if we weren't interrupted by a boring action scene. But despite its flaws, this is the first time that I've genuinely enjoyed a Disney/Pixar film in almost 3 years. Definitely go see it, especially if you have kids.",Onward
270,pruz-55801,Wow! Pixar is back!,10,8 March 2020,"While not exactly redefining the wheel (which we've come to expect from pixar films) onward is powerful and so clever that it does in its own unique way. The story revolves around two brothers for the whole 2 hours, showing their ups and downs which makes two elf brothers seem very real. Obviously the movie can't just have a good message, it needs to be a good movie! Dont worry cause pixar will take you on roller coaster of a ride and still do it on a great place. The world building is something, and the wit consistently made me smile. But the best part of it had to be the cleverness of the movie, I cant say how they did it without spoiling the movie.
Bottom line expect a kids movie aimed at adults and watch with a loved one (and a pack of tissues)",Onward
271,titushowlett,Another excellent Pixar film! What's with the sub-par reviews though?,9,4 April 2020,"I loved this movie. Stunning animation as always and a great story to tell! My favorite part was when Ian came to the realization that his brother was there for him after constantly thinking only about his dad. Makes those who've lost their loved ones try to look for who was there to love them through the rough times. Barley is an excellent character as well, not being jealous of Ian being the one to have all the power was a great choice. He is fearless and such a joyous, kind, and dorky guy. I don't quite understand the reason behind the dropping reviews as this gives an important and original lesson. You can still find joy when times are tough, be more adventurous, be yourself and have no regrets! Fantastic film that was quite enjoyable and will definitely rewatch it.",Onward

But these things that could not be done with my father were done with my brother. He suddenly realized that his brother has been fulfilling his mission to grow up with him instead of his father. He went over the mountains, the purpose of the long journey was to meet his father. Although he didn't see his father in the end, he changed his view of his brother and understood his brother's good intentions. This is the meaning of this journey. From the time when I had a gap with my brother, and then I shook hands with my brother. From the beginning, I could give up everything in order to see my father, and voluntarily give this opportunity to my brother. You always feel that you need to tie a rope to cross a cliff. In fact, you can do it without a rope. Just as you always feel that you need to be accompanied by your father to grow up, in fact you can grow up alone. You always lack self-confidence and always doubt yourself. In fact, you are far stronger than you think. ""Calling"" with my father's recording was too bitter, and Barry handed over his father's hug to Ian, which made people cry.",Onward

The main characters are supposed to be elves but look more like goblins. It felt like the Pixar formula was implemented without elegance or art. So it takes 2 crystals to bring back the dad? Appreciate your boof head big brothers is the moral of the story. The quest apart from a section in the tunnels was boring. I didn't laugh once. Everything was lame. Pixar used to be a brand you could count on for quality family but no one in my family was entertained. The ending was a sad missed opportunity. So glad we only streamed this",Onward

You won't get bored because of this two brothers journey through the whole film solving their own problems creating another one.And the drama Between two brothers.. Oh my god!

288,regexfan,"A lot of heart and soul, but male demographic might find it boring.",7,31 March 2020,"I think I understand why some people said this movie is boring. I'm just gonna go ahead and assume the majority of people who said this are from the male demographic, and there's nothing wrong with that. This is how I see it: male demographic will expect a movie that involves actions, lots of jokes, unpredictable plot, and maybe a little bit of heart. What this movie is, though, is this: a lot of heart and soul, some actions, a little bit of jokes, and a very good execution of predictable scenes and plot.So if you go in expecting it to have the Toy Story or Finding Nemo vibe, you might be disappointed. To me, this movie has the Inside Out vibe, except that Inside Out is a lot more original. I might sound negative so far, but I actually really enjoyed the movie. There's nothing much to say about the plot because like others have pointed out, it's everything you would expect when you watch the trailer, it's your usual race against time family theme. But to me what makes the movie a winner is the execution. It's nothing you've never seen before, but it's done Pixar style. And Pixar is famous for pulling at your heart strings, and they successfully did that with this movie. Yes, you saw it coming but when the scenes unfolded and dialogues were delivered, they were delivered well, and you still teared up. In my case, I cried like a baby.",Onward

291,sebastianschlicht,Modern fairy tale from Pixar and Disney!,7,20 March 2020,"Dan Scanlon started in the storyboard area for unpopular Disney sequels like ""Pocahontas 2"" or ""Arielle 2"". His first directorial work in 2013 was ""Monsters University"", one of Pixar's weaker films (the weakest films are certainly the ""Cars""-trilogy ). In 2020 Pixar gave him a new chance with ""Onward"". This film has finally been an original Disney film again, which is neither based on a previous film nor a remake. It is therefore not surprising that ""Onward"" does not really show good box office results, which is also due to the current Corona panic ... But how refreshing it is to finally see a Disney film that presents a unique idea and isn´t depending on Nostalgia. ""Onward"" is not at the champion level like the ""Toy Story""-trilogy or ""Inside Out"", but definitely an entertaining, creative and charming animated movie for young and old.Magic rules in a typical fantasy world. But one day the elves, fairies and goblins of this world discover electricity and from then on everything changes. Many years later we experience the story of Ian and his brother Barley. Both miss their father who has passed. However, when Ian turns 18, his mother gives him and Barley something from their father that should not be passed on until Ian's 18th birthday: A magic wand. Suddenly there is the possibility to bring the deceased dad back for a day, but not without complications ...
A very funny concept that Pixar and Disney presenting us here. Admittedly, the first trailer didn't look very promising, but in this regard Disney and Pixar have never really scored any points. Even ""Inside Out"" did not look appealing at first and is now one of the most celebrated animated films of the past decade. ""Onward"" also quickly shows its charm and above all its colorful and fun characters. As so often, Pixar skillfully combines funny and tragic moments. The end is an emotional climax in my eyes, while the rocker fairies have been one of the funniest moments in recent years for me in the cinema! ""Onward"" is full of charming and exciting ideas and stages this road movie in a very lively and varied way. On top of that, in my eyes the film also contains a strong message for children who are faced with problems similar to those in this story.But as entertaining and adorable the whole thing is, ""Onward"" suffers from some clichés that are standard for Disney and Pixar films today. Many events are relatively predictable. I would have liked a little more variety and surprises here.Visually, the whole thing looks great, of course, unbelievable how photorealistic today's 3D animations can look. Otherwise, the character design is relatively typical for Disney/Pixar, but still strong and completely sufficient.
The music by Mycheal and Jeff Danna is suitable and very engaging towards the end.Conclusion: ""Onward"" is a little too predictable for my taste, but still very exciting, entertaining and even touching in many places. On top of that, the film scores with very funny characters and ideas, making it one of the best animated films of the year!",Onward

Second point; story. It's a kids movie, especially for young boys. They don't get Shakespearian storytelling. It's catered perfectly to the target audience.

300,vgamerdc,Survive the first 30 minutes and prepare to be manipulated,5,8 March 2020,"Hey Pixar, I'm gonna be honest. I didn't like your film. The first 30 minute you go by-the-book with lazy Save the Cat screenwriting work time make your audience pity the protagonist as much as possible. There is awful on the nose dialogue and exposition. Chris Pratt and Tom Holland are only using their voices to act, there's no real emotion, but that's not your fault on the writers team.
Things in act 1 I didn't like was the list making, the film schooly silent storytelling, and the manipulation between the character and audience in a poor attempt to create sympathy.Once our adventure began and our characters started being active and doing things, working with each other, I did begin to enjoy it. The shrinking visual gag was good, and I enjoyed the characters we BRIEFLY met and locations along the way. However, I still felt you pulling my strings.However, after we escaped the water area I did feel you tightly puppeteering again. The end of act 2 low point break up was super forced; Tom and Chris's dialogue was was too on the nose and their acting was not good.
""Good acting is loving truthfully in imaginary circumstances"" - Sanford Meisner.
The acting in this film was all forced through the voice. Same with the animated acting.I'm sorry guys, I wanted to like your film but I didn't. The story is very basic, something a high school screenwriter attempts, your characters aren't very deep, your emotional connection isn't character based-The father/son connection is pulling too much fro reality like Murph and Cooper in Interstellar. There weren't many good jokes in the foreground or background (come on, I know you guys watch BoJack Horseman). And surprisingly, perhaps because this seemed so corporate driven, it felt RUSHED. I imagine if you either cut scenes and extended others to be more character based, rather than rushing as fast as you can to finish the film (or frankly just shorten Act 1 by a lot), you could have the same run time and even more Story!If you read to the end of this review I thank you for giving my vocie an opportunity to be heard and I hope Pixar takes their time making ART instead of basic commercial films which follow a predicated template and are only notable because of the company name.",Onward

That's why people from all ages enjoyed their work. These days, though not exactly soulless, that little ""extra"" seems to be missing.At times Onward is funny and heartwarming, it has an original setting and overall there's not much bad to say about it.

I felt forced to laugh at the slightest bits of ""comedy"" given throughout, no genuinely funny moments I saw. A cliche ""dead father, race against time, almost get it but 'you learn something all along along the way'"". Exposition was TOTALLY rushed and gave no backstories or reasons to like these characters or care for them. The Ian character is your typical average teen character with a voice that nearly got on my nerves. Barley (what is this name lol) was okay but not developed as fully or focused on he should have been. Manticore was just Miss Fritter from Cars 3, mother reminiscent of Squishy's mother from Monsters U. No real chance of any character (not even Ian!) to be fully developed for me to grow a connection to them. It was rushed, cliche, and predictable. Ending was an attempt to pull me in, and almost did, but it just wasn't enough.And no, it was not even close to being like Frozen besides the ""only having each other"" cliche despite these two having their mother. But would definitely recommend over it.",Onward

For starters,this is a really decent Pixar movie although it doesn't live up to the mark of the recent stand-alone movies like Coco (2018) and Inside Out(2015). The animation is neat and colourful. The two brothers had a really good characterisation, they were comedic and thought provoking at times. The overall background music was fitting.The movie does take around 30 minutes to set up for the quest ahead. It's a bit dull at the beginning but becomes more exciting as the journey begins. The second act was the adventure part,it was fun and colourful to watch. The third act was the best,a fitting and emotional conclusion to the movie. At times the pacing is a bit messy and the stakes weren't shown as high as they wanted it to be.Overall,this is fun and entertaining watch for everyone. If you loved the standalone Pixar movies, you'll certainly like this one, neither the best,nor the worst.Pixar Animation Studio

320,Rachel_Dunphey,Bravo Pixar (Again),8,14 March 2020,"While this movie does have some overused tropes (such as a dead parent, or typical magical story quests) it portrays them in a new and innovative way. Keeping you entertained the entire time.I would like to start by praising the amazing script written by Dan Scanlon and Keith Bunin. It is written realistically, siblings fight and say nasty things to each other sometimes, single parent has a boyfriend, it's freakin scary to merge into traffic for the first time, etc. I especially loved the mother in this story (played by Julia Louis-Dreyfus). It was so refreshing to finally see a parent who wasn't oblivious toward her kids. I often feel as though parents are played as dumb or unknowing, when, in reality, we need them in our lives. Also it was really cool to see that even though Laurel Lightfoot has a boyfriend she still puts her kids first and cares deeply for her late husband. She was just such a refreshing and well rounded character overall.Not only are the character well rounded but so is the movie. They give you the perfect balance of humorous, adventurous, and emotional scenes (what Pixar film ever leaves you with dry eyes). Making it a perfect family movie everyone will love.It was a great movie and definitely worth the money to see in theaters.

Words fall short when attempting to share how this movie made me feel. I thought of my own boys, and I thought of my little brother. Family love is paramount.The other primary message is that we can find magic from the past. Take a walk in nature. Ride a horse in the mountains. Disconnect from the modern world and explore with all of your physical senses. Build something with hand tools. Learn to play an instrument. Read a book.

323,krinnylife,Lots of dialogue,7,11 March 2020,"My older children enjoyed this movie, however my 4 and 6 year old commented that their was no singing and they had a hard time sitting still. Great movie, just maybe not for younger viewers.",Onward

At least that's how it felt. The larger of the two brothers felt like a reskin of Buzz Lightyear, while the younger brother was everything I hate in a character. The action? Well if you watched the preview you have pretty much already seen all the action this film has to offer except the ending, which was really not at all satisfying. You are kind of left feeling like you are peeking through a hole looking at what could have been.",Onward

The dead parent thing has been done to death (pun intended), and I did go in knowing the theme, but it was just a bit, boring. Chris Pratt clearly wasn't let loose in the script or acting and was a bit of a disappointment. The visuals are good.",Onward
327,Sabaher,A nice little film but not a Pixar classic,7,8 March 2020,"Onward is a fun road trip movie with little dashes of Indiana Jones, plenty of fantasy creatures, charming leads and some nice worldbuilding. What holds this one back is the actual plotting of their quest. It felt pretty sloppy to me. It feels like they didn't put enough tought into it. But, like most Pixar films, it has some real emotional depth, especially for people who lost a parent when they were young. It explores the feelings and the regret that you experience because of that.Overall, while this is an absolutely enjoyable and emotional film, the spimplicity of the plot and the issues with the plotting stopped it from being another Pixar classic.7/10 go check it out but don't expect a classic like Finding Nemo or Toy Story.",Onward
328,HunterGee,Perhaps my favourite from Pixar,9,5 October 2021,"I wasn't sure if I wanted to write a review about this movie but I had too. I enjoyed it so much.I'm not sure where to begin.The animations is good 9/10
The story 9/10
Humour, maybe a 6/10
And honestly the two main characters 9/10
It wasn't apparent to me until almost the end the real story here was about brotherly love.From almost the first moment in this movie It is clear that Ian Lightfoot is longing for a relationship with a father he never had. And a result from this is him lacking certain skills. Confidence being the major one. Not having a father does certainly leave you with a lack of certain skills. (I can relate to that)
His brother Barley on the other hand is the opposite. Fearless because of his experience as child when his father was dying.Therefore, he doesn't let the lack of a father stop him from exploring the world unlike his little brother.During the quest it's later revealed that Ian thinks his older brother is a screw up. This revelation to Barley is quite hurtful. And especially because Ian was the one person that he probably thought he'd never hear this from. As Barley seems like the type of person who doesn't care what people thinks of him. Seeing his interests, the car he drives, and how he expresses himself.They soon get passed what was said when Ian decides to put faith in his brother opinion, which later is proved to be right.The brothers continue on the quest to save what time they have left with their father. While Ian continues to long and hope to share memories with his father and perhaps even learn something from him.Fast forward to the climax when they end up back where they started, it appears Barely was wrong about the path and Ian again thinks of him as a screw up and leaves Barley.With almost no time left Ian sits with his fathers legs looking at the list of things he'll never get to do with his father. But that's when it hits him. Ian has had a father this whole time. His brother Barely. Everything on his list had already been accomplished.He runs back to apologize to his brother who just found the gem and unleashed the cure. Turns out Barley was right.As the dragon comes for the gem and towards the brothers one has to make the sacrifice of not speaking with their father.Ian. He who spent the entire movie dreaming of meeting his father. He who it meant so much to, probably more to him than to Barley. But he makes the sacrifice.Because Ian knew that he had a father and would continue to have a father, and Barley didn't, nor would he.(That's if you don't count the half horse half man step dad)
Well there's my recap/ review
This movie was special to me. And I can see myself watching it again and again.Before watching I said to my brother ""Tom Holland and Chris Pratt, I can't go wrong.""",Onward
329,VS132,"""Journey To The Center Of The Staff""",8,7 March 2020,"As far as Pixar films go, I was quite surprised that I really enjoyed Onward. I mean, obviously the animation looks great and the voice acting is solid but the true heart of the film comes from Ian and Barely, who have great chemistry with one another. You get the sense that they have been through heck and back with one another like two good brothers should. That bond also made for one of the most genuine sibling relationships in a Disney film and Tom Holland and Chris Pratt hit a home-run with their delivery. Most of the jokes were actually paced well, especially when it came to the duo casting creative spells. In fact, the mythology of the past and present merging made the narrative more exciting for our heroes to find their father. The side characters, while could have used more development, are still serviceable in their own rights. Overall, I believe this is one of Pixar's better films in their originality department and are off to a fresh start in the new decade. Also, just a heads up, that ending, classic Pixar tugging at our heart streams.",Onward
330,q-02121-71714,magic,7,5 April 2020,"To put it simply, this film tells the story of a pair of brothers with very different personalities in order to find the upper body of their long-dead father. (because the setting in the film is in a world where high technology has completely replaced the way of magic hair) easy blood.Strictly speaking, in fact, the feeling of the whole film is in line with the rules, Pixar's normal level, but the personality of the characters is very substitute. The film should be a tribute to ""Dragon and Underground City""Harry Potter"" and other movies, is some small eggs.This is a story about finding lost affection. Although I have seen what I want to express in other movies many times, I still find it interesting: the really important emotion is not brought by blood, but by companionship.The structure of the story, the opening and closing are very regular, interesting laughter one after another, and the story is buried deep; a few scenes are very romantic and hot (the car actually brought the most dramatic effect), the main character is prominent. What impressed me was the protagonist duo (needless to say, the protagonist halo), Colt (who finally dumped his hair so handsome), his father (laughing), and the flying party elves (in contrast, with the rebellious color of Dituni keeping pace with the times in recent years).In fact, in addition to the discussion of family, there is also a theme that has been mentioned again and again: the instinct of suppressed people. In the film, Ian's suppressed magical potential by modern life, Colt's repressed human and horse running power (in order to adapt to modern life and shove himself into a police car that is not suitable for his body), scorpion tail flying lion is suppressed by economic life heroism, forget his wings can fly the flying party elves, all express the modern life and the high-tech era of the development of the suppression of human nature. Although I agree that modern life is also the result of human development and progress, it should not be a constraint for us to suppress our instincts (for example, bravely do what we want to do and embrace seemingly childish ideals).",Onward

I love the story and since two of my kids are into dungeons and dragons, I loved that that was incorporated into the plot. Barleys unwavering optimism balanced with Ian's lack of self confidence was perfect too. As an orphan myself, I love the natural path the story took to lead Ian to his big epiphany regarding barley. It didn't seem forced at all and by the end, I was bawling. Giving it 9 stars because 10 seems like overkill. But really, solid movie for all ages.",Onward

335,petereviews,A Worthy Journey,8,9 March 2020,"The Good: As a fan of Pixar, I was very worried about this movie, particularly as the setting came off to me as so uninspired from the trailers. For the first half-hour (see the bad), these fears were not assuaged. When our heroes, however, entered the tavern, something magical happened and the film drastically improved as the setting started to open up and show the viewer some unexpectedly thoughtful commentary on urbanization.While many reviews have deservedly focused on the ending that pulls on the hearstrings, they seem to miss that one of the key themes of the film is the growth of our protagonists' confidence throughout the film. Aligned with this growth is the opening of the setting, as what is an initially mundane premise increasingly opens up and adds magic and memorable moments to the viewer.This all leads to the ending which I can't in good conscience spoil.... but just be warned that you will need to bring a pack of tissues for.The Bad: As mentioned before, the movie starts very slow and seems very average/uninspired. It also feels like the movie's pacing could be a little bit tighter in places.IMDB doesn't allow me to give .5 (this movie is screaming for a 7.5 score), but I want to mention that while the ending will stick with me, I feel like a lot of the movie is disposable (I can't remember the character's names for the life of me). That being said, the movie is still very entertaining!Film Highlight: The ending... again I can't spoil but everything just really comes together.Conclusion: While slightly disposable, this movie is still worth seeing (though not necessarily in theatres) and will grow on you as it goes along. Just make sure to bring the tissues.",Onward

342,austinbmoney,A Solid Pixar Movie,8,13 November 2020,"There is a whole lot of good in this movie, and not much that is bad, which is what we have come to expect from Pixar. The animation, world, and character designs are so well done, and very creative, definitely some of the most creative creations that I have seen in a Pixar movie. The film also doesn't overstay its welcome, coming in at just over an hour and a half. The acting is great, with Tom Holland and Chris Pratt in the lead roles. While it is not a live action film and just voice acting, their characters have a lot of great chemistry in the film, and it makes for a good family story that can teach younger children lessons that they will remember for the rest of their lives. While this is a good film, there are some things that keep it from being a perfect film. Like I said, this movie is a good length, however there are some scenes throughout that drag on, and could have had better pacing. Much of the film is also cliched, and pretty formulaic in terms of how the story plays out, making it very predictable, similar to how most other children's movies are these days.
While Onward is a little bit too predictable and formulaic, it has many great qualities to it that helps it to stand out from most other animated films that come out these days. It is entertaining, and can be very emotional and touching at times, and makes for a great family adventure.",Onward

349,Propagandist,A shadow of Pixar's former self,5,30 August 2020,"For a quarter of a century I loved Pixar Movies. They always combined top-notch animation (for the time being) with a plethora of witty dialogue and funny ideas. I always felt that all participants gave their heart blood to make the best movie imaginable. Yes, not all movies were spectacular, but all of them were at least great.
Unfortunately, I'm afraid their star is fading, and not necessary because John Lassiter was canned. In my eyes it started earlier with mediocre sequels like: ""Finding Dory"", ""Toy Story 4"" and: ""Cars 3"". To me productions made for the money not the imagination.
""Onward"" is not different. It features a promising concept of a land of magic creatures and its yield to the comforts of modern civilisation. It also features stunning graphics, but very little of the wit, fun, and heart blood of older Pixar productions. While WALL·E was able to convey great love with some metal plates - and virtually no talking, the protagonists in Onward talk about it all the time, without really showing it. In fact, I caught myself pausing the film eventually to do some household stuff.
""Onward"" still is not a bad movie, but it does not feature the excellency that marked Pixar movies for a quarter of a century! So, if it's a rainy Sunday and nothing else is on, go for it, otherwise look ""A Bug's Life"", ""WALL·E"" or: ""Brave"" again.",Onward

353,goal-82068,"Not a Classic, But Still Entertains",7,6 March 2020,"For me this was not Pixar at its best, but Pixar does not have to be at their best to create a really good movie. Tom Holland and Chris Pratt play the two elf brothers in this film and they knock it out of the park. Their chemistry with these two characters is magnificent. They are the best part of the film and when the film is not focused on these two characters this is when the film slows down. The adventure these two brothers go on is very exciting. They learn a lot about themselves and each other on this trip and the audience gets to connect with these two characters. Pixar is great at making these worlds that you want to learn more about. This movie is also very very funny. This is thanks to the world the film is set in, and also because of Chris Pratt being Chris Pratt. I feel like this film could have showed us more of this urban fantasy world. This movie also tugs at the emotional part of you just like any other Pixar film will do. One thing this Pixar movie was missing was that one song that you will remember after the film. I would have loved to have one of those moments. But this is one of the better animated movies I have seen in a long time. Probably the best since Toy Story 4.

You can see the nods to its influences, but it barely qualifies in any of the subject it touches, since so the plot focus so little on the magic part, it becomes plot device. The bland humor, the symbolic take on violence isn't really working; and really subtle hints on feminism and LGBTQ themes deviates from the storytelling.Looking back, Pixar was never really too good at telling teenage stories. Of course, the studio has its strong suit--family themes--the sincerity and honesty work every time.

365,SadDevilExperience,For a movie that goes against the obvious...,5,6 May 2020,"I tried to really like this movie, and for its credit, it's not a bad movie per se. It's just a mix of good and bad. In typical Pixar fasion, they delivered us beautiful animation once again that produced some pretty images. Additionally, the voice acting was decent. Some were better than others. I actually didn't know Octavia Spencer was in this movie until after I watched the movie so that was a nice surprise. The movie also sets up a nice atmosphere to get the young ones reeled in. However, in spite of all this, this movie's biggest flaws were the overused clichés and the predictable story line. Watching this movie, I was easily able to guess the next few lines or even the next flew plot points. Also, in typical Disney fashion, we have a dead parent cliché, although this time we at least have the opportunity to bring him back. Heck, a whole adventure is made out of this, so that's an interesting addition, even if we have seen the ""race against time"" bit in several other films. On top of that, some of the jokes felt recycled, like I heard them in other Disney Pixar movies. Another problem this movie has is that, because everything felt overused, there aren't any interesting characters in this movie. It was hard for me to engage in them because I've seen characters like this before. The only thing I haven't seen (but I'm sure is out there in several films) is the brother-duo shtick. I especially didn't really like the punk pixie characters. They were too annoying for me. Finally, the ending left much to be desired. I won't spoil it for you, but all the movie felt like a build-up to another redundant message we've seen over and over again. It left me very disappointed. In conclusion, Onward has many areas in which it is lacking, especially when it comes to story, but from an artistic and performance perspective, it was good.

Even though we have already seen this type of arch it's done to perfection. The characters are likable, it has funny little jokes, we can see their growth clearly, the final part it's purely emotional and everything that they show has some propose. The magic world could be more explored, and e felt that it was a bit on the short side, but maybe it was because I enjoyed the movie so much that I didn't realize the time passing. Like I said in the title the RPG/magical theme it's something that I like a lot and I loved to see so maybe I'm a little biased.

I liked how one character is literally just legs yet you get the same range of emotions you'd get from a regular character. This is also a very emotional movie that makes it's audience laugh and cry. Despite how unique it seems, it still follows the typical Disney/Pixar formula and all the tropes that come with that. It's also quite predictable. Despite that it manages to be very emotional and interesting. Pretty good but not the best thing ever.",Onward

378,ontariowarrior,What could of been,6,17 May 2020,"Straight to the point, Onward is not that bad of a movie. It is really simple, predictable and tells a story we have seen 100 times.
The problem I have with Onward is that this movie builds such a cool world, with the mix of magic and also a modern fantasy world. There is so much potential, and instead we get stuck with a dull quest and only see this world through a van.
This movie would make a way better TV show, with a bunch of adventures like the movie has but it shows you more of this world that Pixar built. It just feels like a huge what could of been.",Onward

Taking something simple and repetitive and dousing it in their Pixar magic. Onward tells a story of two brothers as they journey off to find the phoenix stone so they can see their dead father one last time. Tom Holland and ChrisPratt have great chemistry and almost make you think that they are real-life brothers. The rest of the cast is somewhat forgettable but have their moments to shine throughout the film. Pixar steps up the game when it comes to animation in Onward. This is hands down the best looking Pixar film I have ever seen. Overall, Onward is a no brainer for Disney/Pixar fans alike.",Onward

384,JakobKarboe,"The path is too straight, but magic and Pratt is fun",7,23 April 2021,"I like the message of technology taking away the magic from the world, but as this as the theme, I felt like the movie was to concrete and not going far enough on the edge creatively exploring. This might have been sort of a intersting artistic choice as the world itself is supposed to be a magical alternative reality, but having too explicit path and goal as well as not many magical surprises made me wish for more. It might have worked to such a straight forward story if the world was more creatively diffuse and confusing, but this is not the case.The acting I very much enjoyed. Chris Pratt is amazing at expressing living dynamic personality through his character which made me empathize more then I usually do with these animations.The magical vibe is fun, too concrete story, and good acting.",Onward
385,annekehensley,"Creative, fun, and emotional",9,24 May 2020,"I didn't come into this movie expecting to nearly cry more than once. Somehow, despite not feeling so strongly about it through the trailers and reviews, I walked out having traveled on a journey of laughter, smiles, fear, even some tears.
I have no idea why people rated this movie less than what I give it now. This movie has given almost everything it could and put heart into the journey it takes our protagonists on, as we see the true development of family bonds while they attempt to bring back their father along the way. The only gripes I may have with this movie is that much of it might feel very long if you're not a fan of traveling scenes, which there are MANY, but they all have reason, good dialogue, funny moments, or skip to the good parts.
Please give this movie a chance if you were skeptical at first like me. I guarantee this is perfect for the family, and may even jerk a few tears from you like it did with me. It teaches very important lessons along the way, and above all, everything in the story ties together so well by the end that you'll be amazed at the great work the writers had done for the movie.",Onward
386,coopermcdonald-52056,"Same Pixar tricks, but still unique in its own way",7,18 April 2020,"Onward springs from a deeply personal place and nestles on a heartbreaking premise: the possibility of being able to spend just one more day with a parent who has passed away.
But the high-energy, pop-culture-heavy result feels frantically eager to please, until it tries to yank at your heartstrings in the by-now familiar formula of Pixar Animation. The film is episodic in structure, leaping from one place to get one thing before leaping to another place to get another, and so on and so on in a series of breathless fetch quests. But in the few moments when it settles down and allows its characters to interact with one another in a meaningful way, Onward provides a glimpse of what director and co-writer Dan Scanlon probably was aiming for in sharing an intimate piece of his childhood on the big screen.
Scanlon was inspired by the death of his own father when he was just a year old; his brother, who's a few years older, had only hazy memories. From his own loss, Scanlon tells the story of two blue haired, elven brothers living with their widowed mother in a world that was once full of magic. Long ago, it was a place of unicorns, mermaids and fairies, filled with rolling, green hills and tinged with pixie dust in the air. Now it looks a lot like our modern world, just with no humans. The mixture of old and new reveals itself in some clever ways: tract houses are shaped like oversized mushrooms and baby dragons serve as perky, slobbery pets. But while the background details can be quite lovely in their tactile realism (shafts of sunlight, bumps of asphalt) the bulbous and simplistic character design is blandly off-putting.
Thankfully, the voice work from stars Tom Holland and Chris Pratt is strong enough to overcome that. Holland plays the shy, skinny Ian, who was in his mom's womb when his dad died; he's hoping that turning 16 will inspire him to make friends and take chances, and he has a checklist of goals to make it all happen. Pratt plays boisterous big bro Barley, who's a bit stunted and still living at home with their mom (Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who makes you wish there were more to her character); he's into a Dungeons & Dragons-style role-playing game and drives a retro van with a unicorn emblazoned on the side. Despite their inherent differences (or perhaps because of them), the two have a likable chemistry with each other. So when Barley says playfully to Ian early on, ""There's a mighty warrior inside of you, you just have to let him out,"" the sentiment comes from a place of authentic kindness and doesn't sound as mawkish as it might look on the page. (Plus, it's just amusing to imagine a world in which Spider-Man and Star Lord are brothers affectionately messing with each other.)
Both guys get a chance to tap into their hidden adventurer when their mom reveals a secret to them, one she was meant to hold onto until Ian's 16th birthday: Their father left them an ancient staff with a rare gem to place atop it. Those items, along with a few magical words, would bring him back to them for 24 hours-but they could only perform the spell once and they had to get it exactly right. Naturally, in the excitement of this newfound knowledge, nothing goes as planned; they only get halfway through the spell, resulting in their father appearing from the waist down as just a pair of khakis and shoes with whimsical socks. In order to make the most of their limited time with him, they must go on a journey through their seemingly mundane town to finish what they started and make their dad whole.
The film isn't nearly as funny as other Pixar movies. Onward takes a step back at time from the humor to emphasize its more emotional scenes. We learn near the end that when Barley was a child, his father requested for him to visit him one last time in the hospital, only to hav Barley deemed too frightened of all the tubes hooked up to his dad in the hospital bed, and refusing to enter the room. This influences Ian to make his ultimate sacrifice, and when only one of the boys are able to see their father, he lets Barley make amends for that regretful night he had as a kid.
Onward is both an emotional and comedic ride, and balances the two perfectly. While it features many of Pixar's recycled themes, it still delivers an extremely heartfelt and unique film for all ages. I am rating Pixar's Onward at a 6.9/10.",Onward
387,melissaarevalo-34365,"It is cute, good movie for children",7,16 September 2020,"The movie is not a masterpiece, more because it is for children but it is good to see as a family, idk",Onward
388,maztergamer,Good movie but not a must see,7,13 February 2021,"In march 2020 pixar released a movie titled Onward. Let's see what I think about it.So this movie is good. Not great but good. The animation is great (like every pixar movie except for the ones made in the 90's). They are continuing their approach of making everything pretty much photo realistic except for the characters. As usual the animation tells you what you need to know about the main characters and I don't know how Pixar does that even in their weaker films. There isn't much more to say about the animation. It's Pixar, you know it's going to be great, let's move on.The voice acting is also good, probably because the characters in the film are close to the actors in real life. For example Ian is a quiet and shy character. Who does that remind you of? Exactly (Tom Holland). And Barley is an outgoing goofball. Who does that remind you of? You get the idea (if you didn't know it's Chris Pratt). The voice acting is good. It honestly wouldn't surprise me if pixar just told them to play themselves. Okay they didn't but they clearly based the characters around them. Or they made the characters and realized that Ian and Barley are pretty much Tom Holland and Chris Pratt respectively, I don't know.The characters are pretty good. There are two brothers. I already talked about the characters when I talked about the voice acting. It is a pretty common set of two characters but I mean there is a reason it is done a lot. It does work. I mean they aren't Mike and Sully but it works well enough. There is not a lot to say about the characters, they are just good. So let's get to you could say my problem (?) with the film.The plot is the biggest problem with the film. It isn't even bad, just very predictable. I don't think my expectations even got close to being subverted in the film. Since I have seen a movie before I can somewhat predict what will happen in a movie. I pretty much knew the plot by heart before I even watched the movie. It is very linear. The emotional moments happen where you expect them to, the conflict happens where you would expect it to. You already know this plot even if you haven't seen the movie.Another thing I noticed is that it doesn't feel like a pixar film. Not because it is one of their weaker films but more the topic. The idea seems too complicated for pixar. In most of their movies they take a simple idea and expand on it to make it more interesting.In Onward they take a not so simple idea and expand on it to make it more interesting. Maybe simple isn't the right word. I guess a better word would be basic. Not in a bad way but just one idea. Onward is a fantasy story except people don't use magic anymore. What I am saying is it is kind of a loaded idea compared to some of the other Pixar films. It isn't a problem and doesn't mark it down in my head, just an observation.This movie is good. The animation is good, the acting is good. But the movie somewhat falters with a predictable plot.",Onward
389,sharad-seth,How do they?,10,6 March 2020,"What a masterpiece!

I love how the film is heavily influenced by British folklore and mythology and the film looks very similar to how I perceive Britain to have been during the Dark Ages which is fantastic!However why those two cheesy youngsters try so hard to see their Dad again is a bit weird as what's 1 measly day compared to the countless days their Dad spent with them, it's just not worth the risk to increase their overall time with their Father by a very low percentage in exchange for potentially getting their young lives killed.

And that is so freakishly impressive. 10/10.And now I have to rewatch this movie to pay attention to the words. But I bet that this 7% we use in communication will only bring this score down. So...

It showed that the creative team behind this carefully thought every scene through and made the most of it, so there are no jokes that fall flat, no sped up tempo to hide lack of substance, no needless chase scenes to keep the ADHD crowd from getting bored. It's just a good movie that made this middle aged man laugh out loud several times, which doesn't happen that often, and cry like a baby at the end.When it comes to animated movies this is top 3 for me along with How to Train Your Dragon and Wall-E and I highly recommend it to anyone, especially if you're a fantasy nerd or a metal head.",Onward

The story picked up a lot for me and I really enjoyed how they ended the movie. The film also tied back to some aspects of movie that I didn't care as much for and gave those scenes a little more justification in my mind.Overall the movie is decent for a good chunk of the movie, with the last few acts of the movie being pretty great in my opinion.

Even the steps you have to walk on carefully are an exact duplicate.As if that wasn't enough, they steal even more from Indiana Jones, this time from the cave of the first movie, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981)which is almost a duplicate of that scene, the blob substituting for the boulder.How this didn't raise the ire of Spielberg and Lucas, I don't know. It's one thing to pay an homage to your favorites, its another thing to steal entire sequences and pass them off as your own.

441,ol-11,Mediocre Pixar movie,6,2 March 2020,"After seeing ""Onward"", I do hope this movie is no indicator for the quality of Pixar's productions after the departure of John Lasseter. In my opinion, ""Onward"" is the least inventive and entertaining Pixar movie since ""The good dinosaur"".Yet, the basic idea has potential: Once there was magic, but by and by it was replaced by civilization. This civilized world looks a lot like some random US provincial town - except that it is populated by magical, mythical creatures like Elves, Fairies, Centaurs, Dwarfs, Trolls and so on. No humans! This has the potential for a lot of gags, e.g., a Centaur (named ""Bronco""!) as police officer - in a car. On the other hand: This is no new idea; similar parodies on Smalltown America has been seen in ""Chicken Little"", ""Planet 51"", ""Antz"" or ""Bee movie"", to name only a few CGI movies. There is nothing really new and inventive here as, e.g., the land of the Dead in ""Coco"".Most obvious would be a comparison with ""Shrek"", which features also a world of magical, mythical creatures. Yet while ""Shrek"" has a satirical, cheeky approach to its world and its 'people', ""Onward"" shows a more sentimental, sometimes even corny approach. The 'magical' times are introduced as some kind of lost, yet golden age - which is strange somehow, since all the ingredients of this magic age are still there.Another problem of ""Onward"" are its main characters, the brothers Lightfoot: Elves with blue skin and pointy ears, yet otherwise completely just like some average teenagers of 16 (Ian) and 18 (?, Barley). Great, two more moody teenagers! And there is another stereotype: They are half-orphans, since their father has died even before Ian's birth; since then, Ian seems to long for his lost father. His brother, on the other hand, is shown as a screw-up, role-playing and driving an ancient bus. The most likable person in the family is their hands-on mother.As in ""Coco"", ""Onward"" tackles the contact to the hereafter. But while in ""Coco"" Mexican traditions and myths are used, in ""Onward"" it just feels creepy: In the beginning, Ian summons (more or less by accident) his father - but only up to the waistline! Does that mean that the rest of him is still somewhere in the afterworld?Anyway: Barley and Ian have to hit the road to summon also the rest of their father, since for some reason they have only 24 h for that. This way, we also get a road trip, and while this is probably the most entertaining part of the movie, it is also no new, inventive idea; far from it.Don't get me wrong: ""Onward"" is not a bad movie; is has a lot of funny moments, and the visuals are great. But in my view, it is not very memorable.",Onward
442,jacobmdmayer,An Emotional Story From the Start,9,6 April 2020,"As true Pixar fashion, they are not afraid to shy away at pulling at the heart strings of their audience. Personally that I would say this is more a movie for an older audience purely because children would have a hard time to fully grasp the concept of this film as their is not as much humor in this movie as most Pixar films do. This is a much more mature film from the animation studio as far as the story goes and this film hit me in a lot of feels. Losing my mother at an early age, I saw so much of me in both Ian and Barley that it felt good for the first time in my life to have a movie I could relate to. It is a very emotional movie, and has a lot of heart in it for its barely 2 hour run time. It is one of the few movies to make me cry (the list has 4 films total on it now) and I cried a solid 4 times during this film. So parents, this is a good movie to show kids though it might fall flat with them a bit. But to the maturer viewer, if you have had experiences like this in the film then you'll be in for the time to relate your experiences here. Its hard to explain this film in detail, you just need to see it to know what I mean.",Onward

It was watchable, but will not go on my list of ""watch again"" kids movies. The comedy tended to fall flat, the characters were not particularly relatable, the cliches were overdone and most disappointing of all was that Disney, after many have pointed out that they loved to have dead or missing mothers in their kids movies, has now given us a movie in which the mother manages to live to the end of the movie and the father is the dead one, yet the message is still one about the role of the mother being unimportant compared to the role of the father (or father figure, in this case the protagonist's brother) in a child's development and coming-of-age.

Cant wait to see what Pixar does next. My only issue with Onward is that I wish it felt a little more original.

447,aguilera1685,Not good,4,6 April 2020,"Sorry, but it's just not good. I wanted to like it so bad but it's such a lazy piece of work. For some background, I'm a HUGE Disney/Pixar fan, I own every single title on Blu-Ray. But I also keep it real, I'm not gonna hype something just because of the Pixar label - if it's bad it deserves to be called out.My gripes? The characters aren't developed at all resulting in them not having any likeability and the story is one note and cliche. D&D magic spells turn out to ALL be real? Barley held on to a busted tail light that just happens to come in handy later? They just happen to get a magic staff for his 16th bday and the older brother just happens to be an expert at magic? Oye. They're able to taunt Manticore into such a rage that she destroys her own place of business? They didn't just take a pic on their phone of the map and continue onward? Ohh, his list of things to do with Dad just happens to hit every point with his brother? That's not predictable at all (ignore the fact that he's been on one long walk with Dad the entire feature, eye roll)It honestly feels more like a Dreamworks title script-wise and design- wise. Hauling around the dead dad's legs the whole movie gets boring REAL fast, and the final scene specifically I was like BOY, FIGHT to go see your Dad! Why are you just sitting there watching?? My one compliment to them would be the colors and lighting in the film are beautiful. I especially thought the scene with the pawn shop was wonderfully designed, and Tracy Ullman's character was nicely fleshed out.I'll ultimately buy it for my collection but it'll join the ranks of titles like Good Dinosaur and Chicken Little - one and done watchers. Hope the next attempt is better!",Onward
448,rudayoub,The familiar fantasy set in a modern world,10,6 March 2020,"I saw a lot of reviewers saying that this is an ""overused"" concept, with the dead parents, happy ending, etc. This is a fantasy story with wizards and magic that takes place in a modern city.
Ian, a 16 year old elf wizard summons his deceased dads legs after finding his dads old wizard staff, and goes on a quest with his older brother (whos a history buff and really into magic) to try to find the other half. They take the freeway (obviously).
Meeting an ancient creature that now works as a waitress/ manager of her own ""tavern"" restaurant, it became apparent to them that the modern world has washed out most of the history, legacy, and adventure that once fueled her existence. She's has her own quotes on the walls around her, but does not live by them anymore.
The brothers manage to ignite the fire that was put out inside of her (literally).
Hardships/ obstacles along the way, bla bla bla, Ian Realizes that he's a better wizard than he though he could be, learned to used his heart to cast spells, which was fueled by the chance to see his father again, and guided by his brothers expansive knowledge of magic and spell casting.
Ian finds out that even though he never knew his dad, sharing his own life with his brother meant that his dads soul will live on.
The wizard staff was filled with magic down to the last splinter, so are our lives; Even a little bit of magic is all it takes to reignite a fire that has been put out for the longest time.

My family laughted, had fun, were impressed and excited along the film. The ending was also not 100% happy end.SPOIL--
Message I like is how the movie gradually developed Lan confidence while he is having his brother cheering up, the to-do-list which we aim to achieve them, but they might be already done, and Lan sacrificing his chance to see father because his brother is already his father. And the most heartwarming scene, the hug from his father via his brother.However, I saw some non-sense point in this. I don't know why Manticore was angry in the restaurant like that.

While the characters are fantastical, there's one who uses forearm crutches and another apparent lesbian. Little details like these makes movies feel more welcoming with little effort. Their roles in the movie are relatively unimportant; they're just present and that's nice.That's also how I'd describe ""Onward"": nice. It relies on something Pixar does exceedingly well: playing on heart strings without excessive schmaltz. I don't know how they do it but they've pinned it down. Beyond that, this movie feels familiar (I think Pixar knows that). It borrows much from both Tolkien's and Jackson's Lord of The Rings...visually, musically, thematically, with even a blatant puns (Burger Shire, Mountain Doom cola). Along these lines, the path the brotherly take in the movie in well-trod but also cozy. This coziness will prevent the movie from raising to such heights as Pixar's movies like ""Coco,"" ""Wall-E,"" or ""Soul."" Still, it's better than the average flick and well worth a watch.",Onward

456,adam-63492,"Ignore the bad reviews, this movie is still great, just not Pixar-great",7,12 May 2020,"This movie isn't really like a typical Pixar film. The story was excellent but i can see what some people are talking about when they say it seems 'rushed'. I didn't get that full satisfaction that I normally do when watching a movie like Ratatouille or Wall-e, something in it just seemed a little unfinished. The characters were quite convincing but again I would say a little forgettable and don't have that perfectly crafted Pixar-feel to them.The animation was amazing, the same with the scenery and the idea of a Dark ages with a modernized city, seemed to work pretty well for me, but, many movies with this theme already exist, like Bright for example, so it's nothing groundbreaking. The magic itself was also a little generic. Some of the plot was pretty weak at times leaving a lot of piling questions, which is never good. How was the father was just somehow able to obtain an immensely rare phoenix crystal in the first place, or why he was a wizard and nobody knew about it. Why did the fairies and others suddenly learn how to fly with magic after simply crashing a bike, surely other incidents have happened since this storyline that would make them discover their abilities. How did Ian's magic suddenly improve so greatly to the point where he becomes a professional wizard within a day. It was also a little strange to me why the brothers seemed to miss their father to such a massive degree after so many years. I mean it's very normal to always have sadness, but the level of crushing depression that Ian had seemed strange, that he must have been this sad for over a decade without getting over it, even after he barely met his father when he was very young.Overall, it's still a great movie, and I enjoyed the majority of it. As an animation, this movie succeeds in every way, as a pixar movie I don't think it matches the story quality Pixar is known for. Who knows, maybe we were spoilt in Pixar's early pictures, but movies like Toy Story 4 and Onward make me think we may never get another classic again.",Onward

458,fameasserleeds,Underwhelming after a promising trailer,4,11 March 2020,"Onward unfortunately feels more like backward in Pixar's new film all about wizards and old magic which fails to cast a decent spell.It would be easy to start to compare Onward against Pixar's other amazing films, so I am going to avoid that and talk solely about this film as a standalone effort...and it certainly feels like an effort watching it.Set in a fantasy world which once knew magic, Tom Holland plays Ian Light foot, an elf boy turning 16 years old. He's a bit of a sap with no real get up and go about him. Chris Pratt voices his Barley, his older brother who spends most of his time playing Dungeons and Dragons type fantasy games which he believes are all based on the reality of a time before the world settled into using technology rather than the ancient magic of the land.On his 16th birthday, Ian is presented with a gift his dead dad (it's not a Disney film without a dead parent) left for him. It's his old wizard's staff, and Ian and Barley are given a spell to bring him back to life for just one day. Barley has vague memories of his Dad but Ian, having never met him is keen to see him. They attempt the spell but it goes wrong and only the legs come back, leaving the boys with a dilemma. Do they just have their dad's legs for 24 hours or go on a quest to find a new crystal which will help them complete the spell and see their dad.... Spoiler alert... They go on the quest.And from there, the whole film kinda fizzles out.Pixar have always found the perfect balance between kids and adults for me, but whilst watching this I couldn't help but think that nothing in there was pitched at me as an adult, yet too much was aimed over the heads of kids... So just what is the audience for this film?It's not particularly funny, and underwhelmed me so much after seeing a trailer which really made me think this was going to be an emotional roller-coaster of a film, but in the end it lacked heart and definitely lacked laughs.Side characters fail to add much to the story. Octavia Spencer's ""The Manticore"" is a slight uplift in the story as a beast who has now mellowed and is running a themed family restaurant instead of getting involved in Quests.But that's it.I think kids will enjoy the fantasy behind it all, but it's just a long way from being a great film for me.",Onward

so the spell they used to bring their dad back, They botched the spell the first time only getting his legs, but the second time they got the full spell effect.

473,Chrispy_808,A love letter to Dungeons and Dragons,7,8 September 2020,"Dungeons and Dragons has gained lots of popularity in recent years, due its its higher exposure in media as well as 5th Edition's success. Pixar's latest movie, Onward, is a love letter to the game and the fantasy genre. It takes lots of tropes from DnD and fantasy movies and follows or subverts them.The movie takes place in a world where fantasy and magic once existed, but with the advent of technology those elements have fallen to the wayside. There is a mesh of fantasy races and the mundane world that we know. Enter our two main heroes, the brothers Ian and Barley Lightfoot, two elves who are on a quest to return their Dad back from the dead for a single day. Ian finds that he has the power to cast spells, but his first attempt he can only bring back the legs of his Dad. From there the two go on an adventure and find themselves in situations in situations that are meant to subvert fantasy tropes with a modern day twist. Most of these twists are played for comedic effect, not much of it I found laugh out loud funny, but I was smiling the whole movie. While the film subverts fantasy tropes, the plot structure is actually very predictable, and its very easy to predict all the general beats. The third act of the film has a couple twists though that keep the movie from becoming boring, and really make the movie (nothing too mind-blowing though).The characters follow the same fantasy tropes too. Ian and Barley are two sides of the nerdy character coin, with Ian being very timid and Barley knowing all about the fantasy magic and lore, which is presented as history here. They play off of each other well and make for a solid character core of the movie. The Dad that they bring back though is a bit forgettable, since he's only legs and is largely just played for comedy. While we are reminded of the loss of Ian and Barley's Dad throughout the film, his loss isn't really felt throughout the movie like Carl's wife from the movie Up. The brothers, and the audience, really don't know who this guy was. With the dead parent trope being so overused at this point, I just didn't think they pulled this idea off as well as they could have. As a result, sometimes the stakes aren't really felt and while the emotional beats do hit, they didn't have the same punch. I don't think they had to do anything different here, but it needed some extra characterization and backstory for the Dad.The voice acting is definitely great here overall, with Tom Holland and Chris Pratt doing really well as the brothers. I also enjoyed Octavia Spencer as the Manticore, all of her scenes were a lot of fun. On a note of the music, I really enjoyed the 80's metal that Barley listened to in his van. It fits the fantasy vibe well as well as the character. The use of Marvin Gaye made me cringe a bit, but it felt like that was done on purpose so I enjoyed that bit.Pixar's animation is always great, no complaints here. The characters and scenery really pop, and the world is a lot of fun. You can see lots of little DnD nods around the scenery and you can tell they had a lot of fun with the idea of a fantasy world in the modern age. It's not the most original idea, but Pixar really works to make it their own.Overall, I really enjoyed Onward as a fan of fantasy and DnD. The movie's story is too formulaic and doesn't do enough to stand out, but the world and technical aspects are so good I didn't think about it until after the movie ended. I'd recommend it to fans of both Pixar and Dungeons and Dragons alike, and I'd definitely be welcome to a sequel.",Onward

Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Weekend at Bernies, Harry Potter, I'm sure the list can go on and on but it was so unoriginal that I have already forgotten most of it.

478,matty006,"Funny, heartwarming and action-packed [...]",8,2 March 2020,"Pixar are back with two films in 2020 and their first one is a hit. The film centres around brothers Ian and Barley Lightfoot - two elves whose father died when they were too young to remember him. Given the opportunity to spend a day with him by a magical staff and spell, the boys of course try it out but it doesn't go as planned. This is where the film heads off into their quest to find a gem that can help complete the spell for their father who has returned only as a pair of legs. That's right, folks, Pixar have made a film about a pair of legs. And what a studio to do it. Right from the beginning the film is filled with laughs a minute and great voice acting from Tom Holland (Ian) and Chris Pratt (Barley). You will believe the brotherly relationship between them, as the script is so natural that you can't help but get lost in the mythical world and root for our two heroes. The film isn't without its flaws, however. Unlike Pixar films that have come before, there seems to be something missing here that doesn't give it that level of Pixar magic as in the likes of 'Inside Out', 'Toy Story' and 'Up' to name a few. 'Onward' is more on the level of 'Cars' and 'Brave' in that it's a very good and enjoyable film, but nothing memorable. And much like 'The Good Dinosaur', the backgrounds of the film are so photo realistic, that it's hard to tell this film is animated at times, until the characters come on screen. The animation for mythical creatures is hard to make real; however, Pixar have been so good in the past with rats, toys and monsters, you can't help but feel that the animation lacks in this area. The score as well isn't as memorable as others, making one yearn for Michael Giacchino and his France themed score for 'Ratatouille' or Mexican themed score for 'Coco'. Taking these aside, the film follows that straightforward quest/journey plot and makes you laugh and smile throughout until the end where, although you're expecting it, the tears begin to well up and a warm fuzzy feeling enters your heart. Yes, Pixar will make you cry over a pair of legs in purple socks.'Onward' is a formulaic animated film that is funny, heartwarming and action-packed, but lacks in that special touch that so many Pixar films have had woven into them.",Onward

The world looks beautiful. The jokes are HILARIOUS! I didnt cry as much as in other Pixar films (Up in the beginning) but I did cry like 3 times.

The score actually reminded me of One of the main songs in frozen and every time I would hear the theme for this movie I would think of frozen! The score was just super unmemorable.The ending of the movie was a total letdown.

Its great to see Pixar starting the decade with some original stuff for a change, and despite that and releasing during the coronavirus, it's box office results weren't the worst, all things considered. The voice acting is great, animation is awesome and every plot point is used effectively and everything in the film has a purpose for being there. It's always entertaining and never boring, and the stakes are always high enough to care about what's going on. Our leads have great charisma and contrast each other very effectively, and actually grow as characters as the film goes on.

493,shotfilms,"You can see it once, kind cartoon without vulgarity",4,22 April 2020,"Some people say this is one of the best cartoons for last year while others say it's banal and have a low quality of animation. From my point of view, it is an ordinary but not bad cartoon with a kind story and the presence of a few good jokes.
The first what I mentioned in others' reviews is the distinction from usual storytelling patterns. Many people appreciate a fresh way to tell a story about a guy who is going to adventure and find himself in this way. I can't fully agree with that point of view because I think this cartoon doesn't invent anything new in hundreds of similar animations. But this movie is a little different without any doubt, so it's interesting to see, and some light and funny jokes can increase your mood.
On the other hand, I mentioned what many people who say it is dull and ordinary cartoon don't develop their point of view and don't give us examples of good pictures. So even if I agree with them at the position that this movie doesn't provide us with anything new, I can't say it is dull.
To sum up, I think it is a good cartoon, especially if you have kids around five years old. It contains nothing new, but nothing terrible. You don't remember much after several months because everything you have seen before. But it's pleasant to see it once, and I hope you will enjoy your time.",Onward

506,brian-a-miller84-986-809868,Magical Mystery Tour,8,3 March 2020,"Set in a realm where mystical creatures have swapped the magical for the mechanical and mundane, Onward tells the story of two elf brothers, who, after a botched attempt to bring their dead father back to life, end up on a quest to complete the spell and spend one final perfect day in the company of a man they never really knew.While the animation may not feature sequences as utterly jaw dropping as in Coco, Zootopia, or even the recent Frozen 2,what it lacks in the retina scorching department, it certainly makes up for in feels and pure goofball humour.Essentially a road trip/odd couple/chase movie, Onward's strength lies in how the central relationship between the older, brasher, RPG obsessed Barley and the younger, introverted, nerdier Ian plays out.There are some killer lines, awesome visual gags, and fairly amusing side plots featuring characters as memorable as any in Pixar's greatest hits (The Manticore, I'm looking at you kid). The emotional coda in the last ten minutes also had me weeping, although that may be more to do with my complicated family history than anything else. Or I had all the things in both my eyes. Potatoes/Potatoes.Overall, it's a big, bright and breezy rollicker, and whilst not as polished as other recent offerings from the Haus of Maus animation arm, its zany conceit and chemistry poppin' central pairing helps keep things upbeat and interesting throughout. I give it an artful 8/10.",Onward

From the beginning, it is clear to see the political influence (in regards to technology and remembering to appreciate the past, etc.), yet they do not beat viewers over the head with it, which I think we all can appreciate. Chris Pratt and Tom Holland form a dynamic duo, and you can sense the chemistry between them showing a realistic relationship between two very different brothers. I think there is a lot to learn from this film, especially covering sensitive areas such as loss and handling situations out of your control. As always, there are comedic scenes to enjoy by both children and adults, and I found myself chuckling throughout due to the goofiness of Christ Pratt, and the awkwardness of Tom Holland. I couldn't help but to compare this movie to ""Big Hero 6"", and it is yet another great film showing the value of brotherhood.

I am a huge Disney fan and this doesn't even seems like a Pixar movie. The story itselfs is awesome: 2 brothers who are looking to find a magic gem that could use to a spell that brings their death father back for one day. It's a very emotional story since the beginning to the end. The children could learn a lot from it: the love of a father, and the love between brothers. That shows us that family it's the most important thing for us.
The characters are fun:
Barley it's a very fun character, he it's talented at history, and he wants to save the history of that magic world, whitin the magic that everyone forgot because of the tehnologgy. He is an adventurous character, and brave .Ian is fearless too, a teenager who wants to be like his dad, once with his birthday . He has a talent to control magic and cast spells and he really wants to meet his dad and spen a day with him.Laurel, is a caring mother, she wants to protect her sons and she has fighting skills. She is married to her second husband, officer colt who is a little bit severe when it comes to rules.Maticore, is a great warrior, that forgot who she really is, in present day working in a restaurant. She is a mighty character , brave, and she fights along side her powerfull sword.There are plenty of characters, like the flying faires, ian and barley's little dragon sidekick and mermaid, wizards and unicorns !It's a fun adventure for everyone! I recommand you watch this movie with you family and your kids. It'a great adventure in the magical world of Disney! You will laught and you will cry the same time !

Without going into any details, this movie showed me that Pixar can still make me sob uncontrollably, and I'd rank this higher than Up and Coco on the tear-jerker scale. This movie has the most likable protagonists that I've seen in an original Pixar within the last decade.

This movie is a classic road trip adventure with a Middle Earth twist, and truthfully, that premise sounded unique but semi-boring. But I am more than happy to report that this movie blew me away with its incredibly fun scenarios and locations. The world was mostly immersive and I was able to settle in the atmosphere without poking holes into logic like I thought I would've. Chris Pratt and Tom Holland come off as really likable protagonists, and their acting strengths added to the immense charm of the movie. Without going into much detail, I can definitely admit that this movie made me sob uncontrollably similar to the Pixar films prior. I would almost go as far to say that this movie made me cry more than Up AND Coco, and was only topped by Toy Story 3 on the tear-jerker scale.

531,dahgrdonut,Disappointed in Pixar/ Disney,1,1 March 2020,This movie had no point in ever being made. Disney/ Pixar really aren't living up to the name. The movie is plain boring and dull. Awful.,Onward
532,gamegargle,A Great Adventure Movie,8,12 April 2020,"Onward was a movie that really was charming, and wholesome. Two teens, going on an adventure to look for an artifact to save their dad is a simple plot, but the way that they do it gave it meaning that makes you care. All the characters are full of personality and there are moments that you can relate to at any age. Highly recommend",Onward
533,trentbrinkman,A above average movie that falls on it's face in the second half,6,7 March 2020,"There is a lot to like in this movie, decent plot, good character development but in the second half everything falls apart. The mom and scorpion lion lady were annoying and unnecessary, the cops were annoying and unnecessary. They didn't earn the ending they gave us, I felt more sad about the van than their dad. In the whole movie, like five spells are used. The movie definitely didn't hit many feels like you'd expect but this is still a fun and entertaining movie.",Onward

535,tao-58694,"Fairly Standard Pixar Movie, until that ending...",9,18 July 2020,"For most of the movie, I remember thinking this movie was a fairly standard Pixar movie. It was fun and funny, there were enjoyable characters, a good mix of emotion and goofiness, etc. but it also felt like something was lacking to keep it from the heights of their greatest works. Then that ending sucker punches you in the face with all of the emotions.Without giving away how it happens, the way each brother's arc in dealing with their father's death ends is nothing short of beautiful. It perfectly highlights how both struggled with it in different ways and how they can finally move past it. It also compliments the development of their sibling bond as well, putting a punctuation mark on the adventure that drew them together and letting them deal with their grief while setting up their new relationship going forward and how they've learned to depend on each other's strengths while simultaneously accepting the others weakness.A few other random thoughts: Really good voice work throughout. Obviously Pratt and Holland were the main draws but pretty much every character is very well voiced (especially Spencer as the Manticore). I really enjoyed how the stepfather was a pseudo secondary antagonist without being the normal douchebag stepfather stereotype. He legitimately cared about them and wanted to protect them, as did their mother who turned out to be a total badass. The world building was decent (it definitely did the whole ""Fantasy creatures in a modern setting"" thing better than Bright), though it did bother me how everyone stopped using magic and then it's just brought back so easily. Finally, wow does this movie want to make me try DnD for the first time.",Onward

538,booksrbest13,Dissapointed... Not up to the Pixar Standard,1,10 March 2020,"I really wanted to like this movie, especially when the story line centered around finding magic, adventure, and spending one last moment with a dead relative. It's a movie that had true potential, but it is not up to the standard of a Pixar movie. No magic, great animation, and horrendous story production. The movie seemed rushed, timeline did not make sense, no positivity in the family dynamic, and the brotherly-love was only too short-sighted. Here are the issues that I have seen:The boyfriend/step-father dynamic. Rather than having a positive representation of boyfriend/step-father dynamic, Pixar chooses to go the same negative route as everyone else. To have a dynamic where the boyfriend/step father views their step children negatively. But not only does Barley get mad at Ian for essentially telling him he's worthless - but Pixar refuses to mediate the hostility between the boys and the boyfriend. They also choose to let Barley and Ian say terrible things about the boyfriend. You know what would have also made a good story line? Is to talk about the journey of moving on and acceptance. These boys need to grow up see that they can still remember their father and accept someone new. Someone dropped the ball on this, and I am extremely disappointed.-The Manticore scenario. So, you're telling me that her place burned up in a fire and feels no ill as to what happened. Also, she's not angry anymore, considering it would be 30 minutes or less on the Onward timeline. No transition to the curse, terrible writing.-The timeline. So you travel for up to 18+ hours, yet it takes you 4 hours to get back where you started (with magic help, of course) and filled with 10 minutes of screen time. Also, the ""adventure"" part was ridiculous, too many things they had to do to get back to the High School. The whole trip didn't make sense.How did this story even get green-lit? Maybe because the team felt they had to prove themselves during the transition of the new Director, Dan Scanlon from the executive producer, John Lasseter. I truly hope that the magic did not disappear when Lasseter left, but at this rate, Pixar's new upcoming movie, Soul, also looks just as disappointing as Onward. Nevertheless, I feel Pixar is going on a downward spiral, being subpar in every way possible. Specifically with Dan Scanlon leading the way, as he's been behind Incredibles 2 and Monsters University (which, in my opinion, were also sub-par films) and only one great film, which was Inside Out.I truly hope that Pixar can find other great directors to lead the way, and find innovative story lines to tell. However, being mediocre is not going to be acceptable for long.",Onward

542,LeoAlexson,Become who you want to be,8,21 April 2021,"When I was watching ""Onward"", I could clearly associate myself with the characters.This is a story about two brothers who lost their father, and with the help of magic, they have the opportunity to meet with him again, but only for 24 hours.But to do this, they will have to go through a difficult adventure, during which they must understand that teamwork and support at the very beginning of the path is necessary, and the main thing is that you have the right person who can put you on the right path, let it be not trodden and it may seem that it is not really there, but this support, insurance at the right time will allow you to truly open up and take the right steps.One of the brothers just turned sixteen, he understands that he wants to change himself and his life. He realizes that the time has come to pull himself together and go out on the street as a new person. As a reminder, he made a list of what he must do today in order for his life to change, but he is hindered by the main enemy inherent in everyone, this is fear. Fear of opening up to new people, fear of looking strange, fear of not being able to be brave like his father.The other brother always behaves as if he is not afraid of anything and always open to new obstacles. He loves his car and family, because he has a brother, in whom he believes and will never let him lose faith in himself. Living a full life without fear and doubt, he sometimes seems to other people as if he is useless and makes too many mistakes. But to become the person you want to be, you have to make mistakes: small mistakes, big mistakes, huge mistakes. This bitter experience will help you see the right path.Both brothers need each other to reach the goal of their adventure. However, not only they will get benefit from this journey, on the way they will meet characters who have lost what they had in the past, forgetting in the routine of modern life that they were legends once. After all, why you need to take the right step, run to something after which you will be proud of yourself, if the path that you need to go through seems endless and your legs hurt all the time. So most people just get in the car and drive in circles.When all the mistakes are made and the path has been passed, you will need to return there from where it all began in order to see everything with new, acquired experience and take the last step, open the door with a key and cross the threshold. The reward that awaits you at the end may only be with you for a couple of seconds or you decide to give it to the one who needs it at this moment, anyway you will never say that all this was in vain.",Onward

548,wyledgirl,Hero's journey story,10,5 April 2020,"Fiction is a chance to explore reality. I've read a bunch of reviews that whined about the ""dead parent Disney thing."" Guess what...loss is universal. And this movie used fantasy realm to explore the idea that you can let go of your grief to move on with life while growing in the process. That's a powerful discussion that, especially in times like these, we need to be having with children. It also explored blended families, getting back to our roots, valuing history/not destroying the old because it has value, and finding magic in ordinary things. Plus, it follows the ""hero's journey"" archetype, which is (for me) good story telling. Plus, I am a D&D nerd.When you consider some of the vapid movies that have been released recently, having those things were refreshing. For me, this was a darned good movie. Give it a chance.",Onward
549,notchbaby,How this isn't at least rated an 8 I'll never know,9,2 January 2021,"This movie is delightful, filled with whimsy. Explaining what happened to magic: the real inventions of man made magic seem like too much trouble, and though the magical people of old are still with us they have forgotten who they really are. Two brothers live with their widowed mom and on the youngest boy's 16th birthday he becomes magical. He and his older brother go on a quest to bring back their father until the sun goes down the next day. Of course only half of dad returns- the bottom half. They must find the magic gem to bring enough magic back to get their dad in one piece before the sun goes down.Of course they must fight a dragon, avoid their mom and stay one landslide ahead of their mom's cop boyfriend. The older brother is played by Chris Platt and the character is wonderful portrayed. Even the lesser characters are wonderful. My 5 and 3 year olds laughed and squealed throughout. And we grownups watched it twice.",Onward
550,jeongmin-07340,"We expect experiment, not practice for Pixar.",4,29 June 2020,"I'm really Disappointed with Pixar. For last 20 years, we have seen activities of Pixar. They are always worship novel, artistic things and we have been surprised to their creativity. From Toy story to Coco,
They treat people's natural feeling with impressive story. And unlike other commercial animation studios, this make people expect Pixar to try challenging, artistic film.However, this movie is totally different from before.First, the style of the story and structure changed to worse direction. First time I watched this movie, I think it is Dream work's movie. The style of humors, how the characters progress to next stage is quit similar to Dreamw ork's work, but worse.
There are not enough information why main characters miss their father so anxiously and it is awkward that characters are persuaded with just a few words from main character.Second, the quality of graphic is much lower than before. Lighting and color is finished with low quality. I don't know why, but.. is this because of Corona virus? Anyway, modeling and character design also insufficient. I couldn't find any artistic part in the film.This movie is just a commercial animation film and can't believe that it is the latest result of the studio which make Wall-E, the incredibles, and ratatouille.",Onward
551,darkzatara,Not what I was expecting,2,1 March 2020,"I saw the movie yesterday at a pre release screening. While the animation was very smooth and enchanting as was the voice acting the story was flat. It's a coming of age story that you wanted to have a sweet happy ending.As the movie progressed it became increasingly sad. The whole hauling around the fathers legs was a bit much for me, and every time Ian tries to interact with his dad just made me feel more sorry for the character. The brother was an annoying character and was also a bit hard to like. All the other characters in the story were just thrown in with very little depth. To me the ending was just not what I wanted from this movie and I left the theater feeling depressed. Just could have been more wonder in this movie than there was. Too bad as it could have been much better.",Onward
552,josiahwlawrence,Surprisingly Good,9,16 April 2020,"I judged this movie too much before I saw it. From looking at the style of the film to what the media was saying, I immediately dismissed it as just another animated film that will be nominated in February because of the company's name. When my sister asked me to watch it with her, I was stunned.In a mythical world where magic has become something of the past, Ian turns sixteen and he and his brother Barley receive a present from their deceased father that can bring him back for one day. But when the procedure goes wrong, Ian and Barley are sent on a time-sensitive mission. I really like the story. I wouldn't say it's Pixar's best, but at least it's not another The Good Dinosaur. The pacing is great and should keep people of all ages interested. At times I thought to myself, ""This is cheesy,"" but then I thought about how life is cheesy sometimes and it's not so cheesy anymore.The characters, in my opinion, are great. Barley is more than meets the eyes, while Ian is someone who's scared to try. Even the side characters feel like characters and not plot devices. I do want to talk about one character in particular. Disney's ""first"" LGBTQ+ character Spector. She is barely in the film, and she's getting a lot of attention. This isn't representation. I want to see more well-represented LGBTQ+ characters, but instead, we get characters with throw away lines. She's a good character, but she's not representing, she's a marketing strategy.The animation in this film is stunning, but you should've seen that coming. After all, it's Pixar. This is Dan Scanlon's second time directing an animated film, following Monsters University, and it's damn good directing. Some of the shots impressed me quite a bit, and there's a scene towards the end of the film where I was very impressed with how he directed it.The voice-over work is spectacular. Tom Holland and Chris Pratt are great choices for their characters, while Octavia Spencer nails her role. The sound editing and mixing are great as well.In the end, this film actually reminded me of an important lesson: don't judge art before viewing it. I actually really enjoy this film. The story is captivating, the voice-over work is great, and the animation is beautiful. I do hope Pixar releases more original content like this.",Onward

560,ameypanjwani,Don't take it for granted.,8,14 July 2020,"This movie, made by famous animation company 'Pixar', teaches you to not take things for granted. In this movie, it's family. The main character, Ian, is so focused on meeting and talking to his father, he doesn't see what's right in front of him, his brother. It made me feel bad for taking my family for granted. So many people around the world have lost family members and this has showed me to be grateful for my complete family. I feel as though everyone should watch this film to see what it feels like to have an incomplete family.The moral of this film, to not take things for granted can also be said about the movie. Many people have conflicting and negative opinions about the movie however, we shouldn't take such a high class movie for granted. We may be lacking in high quality movies such as this in the upcoming months, due to obvious circumstances.That being said, the reason why this movie is rated by me as a 8/10 and not a 10/10 is because the ending is extremely rushed, and because some parts of the movie are super cliched. 5 minute ending is a typical happy ending and makes the movie feel incomplete, while the dancing scene at the vending machine is extremely cliched and actually made me cringe.

The plot revolves around two brothers who lost their dad at a very young age, and have very few memories of him (the younger brother having no memory). The characters were very well rounded however, were typical to the Pixar movie archetype of the ""nerdy"" one and the ""goofy"" one.With that being said, the reason why I gave this an 8 and not a 10 is because the ending is extremely rushed. I get that it's a happy ending but the movie could've done with a much better ending than what it had, it was one of the worst parts of the movie. Some of the scenes were also extremely cliched.

Thanks for making this available during quarantine <3,10,16 April 2020,"This one's a love letter to nerds, geeks, and D&D players, and to anyone who ever wished they could spend one more day with a lost loved one. The brothers, Ian (16), & Barley (on his Gap year, so ~18?), go on a quest to fix a botched spell to bring their Dad back for one more day, and the quest helps each of them with their coming of age story - they're both struggling with growing up in different ways. The Dad character, while only halfway present, seems determined to enjoy whatever time with he's got. The Mom gets to kick a little ass.
We laughed through the whole movie (my partner has played D&D for years & laughed the hardest - he confirmed that the gelatinous cube is a ""real"" thing in D&D!). I cried periodically, and sobbed at the end, thinking of an old friend who passed away from cancer before his twins were born this month, but who fought so hard to enjoy what time he had left.

Let me start by addressing the question of how so many of us gave lower scores before the movie was released. We didn't. Theaters offered advanced screenings the weekend before. That said, I didn't hate the film, but Pratt's character was not just a foil to Holland's. He was irritatingly inept at best and downright disastrous at worst. The explanation of magic being cast aside in a society of dwarves, centaurs, manticores, etc. is too hurriedly explained and illogical.

585,aseelabduljawad,Mini Review - Spoiler Alert,5,11 April 2020,I loved the graphics and ALL the voice actors did an amazing job especially the casting for Chris Pratt and Tom Holland was spot on Also really enjoyed the realistic Relationship between the brothers how Barley treated his brother very relatable especially when Ian realizes what his brother means to himI felt like the movie lacked a solid climax where the characters are Challenged and the story needed an engaging good villain the dragon was cheesy not very magical compared to other creatures in the filmDetails I enjoyed how he sacrificed seeing his dad so his brother can see him and the little foot taps between them and their dad were AmazingPersonal opinion it felt like it focused mainly on sadness and wasnt very comical too emotional even though emotions are a good thing the lack of comedy in the movie made it feel rushed,Onward

As someone who's child lost his Dad when he was really young, this hit a lot of soft spots.I also love the bond that you see between the two brothers and how that changes over the course of the film.

Aside from that this is probably the most disappointing Pixar film so far. The charm of their films, to me, has always been the way they work on two levels, catering for all ages. This follows the recent Pixar trend of being so dumbed-down that there is absolutely nothing to hold your attention. My fears should have been aroused when I learned that this has the same director as Monsters University (now the second-worst Pixar movie). Gone are the days where having their name attached to a film was a guarantee of quality......a real shame.",Onward

You know that idea that Disney's Frozen popularized, where instead of romantic love being the answer, it's familial love? Pixar just took that idea to a whole new level. The relationships feel real, which makes the emotional scenes have even more impact.
There's some predictability, but the message of this movie is worth it.
You've got sacrifice; sibling bickering; parental involvement; lessons on trust and accepting help; and love. Love story for the ages here.",Onward
595,seyre-37262,Not fully realized.,6,16 March 2020,"While this movie is very nice to look at, and is competent in the writing department, the world it takes place in is never fully realized. Everything is just our world with fantasy dropped on top. Things like a mermaid in the suburbs, pixies driving human sized motorcycles, and a centaur having trouble with a normal human car, seem to be funny gags someone came up with without thinking through why any of those things would exist in this world. Ordinarily I'd let it pass, but the history of this world is a big emphasis of the film, so not thinking through the history and development of the world really serves to take the viewer out of the film.There were a few hiccups in the story/character department.
The character barley came off as a bit more irritating than I think was intended, being almost completely useless and causing trouble until the writer wants us to feel bad for him, then he was suddenly right all along.
The climax of the film felt a bit hollow. From a character perspective, it makes sense that Ian would sacrifice meeting his dad. However, the fact that the audience spends the entire mission with the ""find dad"" quest makes it a bit frustrating when he does finally come back, but we only get to see him from a distance and from behind.Overall, Onward does have heart to it, but it is plauged by a few issues that hamper the viewing experience.

Story: 7/10 2 brothers go on a quest to meet their long lost dad. The story can get cliched at times(it has the You Gotta Believe cliche), however the story can be very heartwarming at times. I mean VERY heartwarming.
Animation: 9/10 The animation is excellent, with great textures and bringing us into a new world.
Characters: 8/10 Lovable and funny characters. Some jokes the characters make are a bit dumb, but overall, most are funny.
Music: 8/10 Nice music at the beginning and fits the scenes very well. Sometimes they got so good that I got sucked into the movie.
Pacing: 6/10 I did have a problem with the pacing. Sometimes the pacing can get too fast that it's hard to realize what is going on. The emotions are in the right place, but overall, wasn't as good as expected.
There are some times when it can get very emotional and heartwarming (I cried). It can also have cliches, but they are almost done well.

The siblings fight like siblings though out, not just at plot critical moments. Their single mom has a boyfriend who is not an evil stepparent trope, and their mom is actually proactive during the events of the film, but the adventure still belongs to the boys.

And he did that, and I'll forever be grateful for the sacrifices he has made and the hell he has gone through to make life easier for us.
However, with that happening, I didn't have my father beside me to talk to, to laugh with, to protect me. Luckily I had my big brother. He carried on with this role. He was there for me. He was my wall, my shield and he was always there to make me feel good and happy.One of my all time favorite animes is Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood, because it reminded me that there is no limits of the lengths you can go to do what it takes to be there for your brother.
Onward reminded me everything my brother did for me and how he sometimes sacrificed his childhood to take care of me.It was a fun, yet tearful experience especially in the third act.

I like movies that adds a bit depth to interpersonal relationships, and I think it is especially hard to make a family movie with these elements.Although I'm not an expert, I love music and I definitely notice when I like something I hear. I think the music in this movie is okay. If they added a bit of memorable melodies/themes I think the experience would be tons better (maybe easier said than done). During a scene towards the ending I wish they made the tune a bit differently as it had an important emotional moment.All in all the movie made me smile and I'm really happy they made it.",Onward

However, it's not Star Wars, not Wall-E, and what they wanted to present is not the world or setting itself, but the brotherhood, the deep loves of the boys who have grown up without their father. There are so many families that the elder brothers have to play the role of their father and take care of the little ones.

Having looked at some of the low rates reviews I don't really get what they are whining about.Disney/Pixar dished up something different than their usual faffy fairy tale with a Happy ending. It had a nice layer of quite a serious issue to be overcome mixed with the lighthearted experience of a children's film.As someone who lost his dad a few years back I was able to feel for both characters as they go on this quest to bring him back, even for just a short amount of time. Something I for one would love to be able to do but hey it's real life.At the end of the day Onward seems to be a movie that is intended to entertain kids but also not smother it with ridiculous, unrealistic ""happy"" endings. It ended on what I feel is a positive and realistic high note and doesn't pander to the typecast or stereotype of almost every other kids film released.... well basically ever.Kudos to disney for bringing us a world of joy, magic and winder but still grounding it with a sense of reality at the same time.",Onward

652,pacificswimmer,One Of The Most Magical/Family-Friendly Pixar Movies That Have Been Made!!!!!!! :),9,2 March 2020,Onward is one of the best Pixar movies that have been made. The movies is magical yet amazing. It shows one of the best bonds i have seen in a Disney/Pixar movie. It shows how these two brothers are able to accomplish anything that they set their mind to and are able to work together to complete this journey that they take to find their father. Though it may be an exciting and fun movie to watch its also very emotional. The hardship and rough spots that they had to go through was very touching. In the over all end i hope this pushes you to go Watch Onward. START YOUR CARS UP AND HEAD ONWARD TO THE MOVIE THEATERS TO SEE THIS PIXAR /DISNEY FILM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Onward
653,azaugg-97470,Fantastic,10,25 February 2020,"A funny, beautiful film. It's not top-tier Pixar, but I definitely recommend it. The chemistry between the two brothers is the highlight and can be relatable for both siblings and people who've lost a close relative.",Onward

The story is not well developed and the characters in the film just seem to exist in order to learn a important lesson (kind of obvious lesson) .

And it tells a beautiful story. I went in thinking I would cry but I was not ready for just how much this movie would make me feel.Oh and there were lots of funny moments as well!

Overall, I was incredibly disappointed, mostly due to its dull and sleep inducing story line. Although mediocre at best, I certainly didn't expect the level of quality here to be on the same line with other movies from Pixar and Disney.

663,nicxyoh,Pretty (but) Boring,2,8 March 2020,This film dragged on for ages. There didn't seem to be music during it and sounded more like an audio book with tinny voice over not matching the characters. Was really disappointed as seemed like the editing was done in a hurry. Animation nice but the voicing was badly dubbed. Would have rather seen it with no sound and subtitles. Voices were just very tinny with the odd sound of a drum. Most films play music to cover this up but seemed to be silent except for the bad voicing so gave off a bad echo for almost two hours. (Cinema was state of the art VIP so not a venue issue).,Onward

While the story itself and plotting may suffer a few issues like predictibility at times, amazing animation and stunning visuals, along with beautifully designed characters and great chemistry beetween actors who voiced those characters perfectly, make this movie great, enjoyable and worth watching. The way they've used a mixture of real life elements and fantasy elements from Dungeons and Dragons universe is also great and worth mentioning. While, at first look it doesn't feel like a Pixar movie, the more time you spend watching it, you will get all feelings and heart you expect from your average Pixar movie.

The producers did a great job in delivering the emotions to the audience. Besides that, the movie looks amazing, the colors, the animation, the music, everything, well done. Good job!

I'm rlly sensitive person and the fact that Ian didn't get to see his dad had me in tears.

681,creeperscomicsinc,An amazing story about two brothers.,8,25 April 2020,"Onward is Pixar's redemption and arrival back to what it used to be. It had lessons, and it didn't pick up from their old films to create sequels that follow up characters that have already finished their arcs in the first movie. It does something special for children; It speaks about siblings, and how your older siblings will always be there for you when your parents couldn't.Although it has it's positive thoughts, it isn't perfect. A lot of scenes seem rushed and not useful. The main antagonist that only appears in the end of the movie as a large dragon may be teased in the beginning and throughout the movie, but it feels out of place for an adventure like ""Onward"". The Manticore's arc is how she wants to be the tough monster she used to be, but they don't go in-depth with her as much as they do with the brothers.",Onward
682,slcourse,Quality Movie,8,29 April 2020,"Watching at the cinema on Saturday, It was good !!no twist ""your friend is your enemy"" this time which is great because we are getting bored with it
hm overall the story is quite simple not too much new or surprising but that does not mean this film is not worth watching
the story of two brothers who tried to meet his father who was gone
magic inferior to technology? (basic ungrateful people have magic * lol)
a lot of comedy but at the end I have to admit I almost cried
:shy:this family movie anyway
adults will not get bored just watching it, who want to invite children / nephews and others are still safe.oh yeah this is my first time watching it in a 3D cinema (forced due to showtimes)
it doesn't really add to my viewing experience

685,seashell-57368,A Fun Adventure,9,22 May 2020,"During quarantine, I watched the movie Onward on the streaming service, Disney+. Onward is an animated Disney Pixar movie directed by Dan Scanlon that was released in early 2020. This movie follows teenage elves Ian and Barley, voiced by Tom Holland and Chris Pratt, as they encounter a magical staff that could bring back their late father for a day. Their attempt allows them to bring back their father's legs before the spell is broken. Onward follows the brothers as they embark on a journey to fully bring back their late father and come across many characters along the way, such as the legendary manticore. This family friendly movie is sure to bring the whole family together and tell one of the classical Pixar stories that everyone will love.
I personally enjoyed the movie. The animation was really good with lots of attention to detail like shadows and lighting. The voice actors also did a phenomenal job bringing these characters to life and giving them all unique personalities. I love the way the animators were able to give the father a personality, even without anyway for him to talk during the movie. There was also brief LGBTQ+ representation which isn't always shown in movies so I was happy to see it here. Pixar also does something interesting where there is no main antagonist which they pulled off really well in Onward. The movie also did a great job misleading the audience so the ending is definitely a plot twist from what most people expect. Some things I disliked were some scenes moved slower than a lot of the fast paced scenes. I also think that there could be more LGBTQ+ representation, however, movies are slowly progressing towards that and this movie was a step in the right direction.
Overall, Onward was a well done movie. It had many fun and relatable characters that brought the story to life. It's definitely a great family friendly movie that everyone can enjoy. Onward has just the right amount of fun jokes while still having a bittersweet ending all can enjoy. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves Disney Pixar movies or just wants to spend time with family.",Onward

It's not a movie that becomes your ""favorite"" movie but I have to say it's one of the most fulfilling movies I have ever seen. I laughed, I cried, and everything in between and I watched it alone. From the start you can tell it'd be one of those magical movies you don't wanna turn your eyes away from. I got my popcorn and coke ready and man, I was glued to the movie the entire time. I honestly can't say why anyone wouldn't like this movie! It's appropriate to watch with kids of all ages!

It was a little predictable at times but when one's not trying to figure out the movie and just sits back and enjoys the ride, it's time well spent.I was a little bit disappointed that we didn't get to see as much of the world the filmmakers created because it had a lot of potential and so many things to be explored. However, it's understandable because the film was centered around the two brothers and their father, not the world itself. But the settings were great!Some might say the film is a cliche and they wouldn't be wrong. It's a good type of cliche though. I also feel like there was more material than the length allowed so that's why there wasn't any deeper introduction of the characters and the world. In my opinion the script wasn't rushed and still made for a good and enjoyable film.If you want a heartwarming, adventurous and visually pleasing film, definitely try Onward.",Onward

It will likely be more rewarding (maybe also see some natural magic happening).So, what was this movie about? What exactly was the point of the waking legs? It was more creepy than anything else. Certainly did not add anything in the plot (the what?).In bullet points:
* Shallow characters, shallow plot (extremely annoyed in the copycat of Indiana Jones bridge crossing scene).
* ZERO sense in story and character development
* You cannot relate with the characters (although the beginning was promising)

It's on par with Coco in that way.For context, when my mom died, my sister was so much closer to her than I was. And for that reason, this story just ripped out my heart. It was incredible.At its core, Onward is an adventure movie. Were there some cliches? Sure, but that's half the fun.

An un-likable older brother that was supposed to glorify immaturity and gaming glory, a mother that is oblivious to an abusive centaur... etc. This is what one would expect from Dreamworks, which never had soul and is driven by greed.

720,aaliyahreed,A Beautiful and Heartwarming Movie,9,1 March 2020,"I saw the advanced screening of Disney/Pixar's Onward yesterday, and I have to say that I adored it to pieces. It was lovable, remarkable, harmless, heartfelt at times, sweet, funny, wondrous, emotional, and, of course, magical. Pixar has done it again with their outstanding animation. I sat in the front of the theater, and every time a character popped up, I could just see the details of the skin or fur. It was so satisfying to me. The setting was also unique; it was able to pull off modern times while being set in a land with mythical creatures. It's creative and imaginative. The music was outstanding, and it really made me feel like I was joining them for an adventure. The tone was just perfect for this film. Mychael Danna and Jeff Danna did a wonderful job composing the music. It was just grand, and the soundtrack is very worth listening to. The story was simple, but good. Both kids and adults can follow it well and have fun watching this road trip movie. Even though it's not a complex storyline, I loved what they were going with this. Ian and Barley going on a journey to retrieve a Phoenix gem to conjure their father sounds like a good plot. It's more than enough for me. It's just a fun, little adventure with spectacular puzzles, places, and surprises.Ever since the beginning of the movie, I was invested in it. I love adventure/family films, so I was very excited for this one. I am really obsessed over the main characters, Ian and Barley, and they were absolutely admirable in this movie; I loved them a lot. Ian is just like me: shy, quiet, and nervous, so I can relate to him in so many levels. His character was really great. He came across as a teenage boy who was trying to find his purpose in life while trying his best to connect with his dad. I found him really enjoyable. His older brother, Barley, was also great. I loved his adventurous and rowdy personality. He could be a goofball at times, which is totally okay with me. He's such a good big brother to Ian, and he made this movie entertaining. The relationship between him and Ian can be so relatable to so many siblings out there. Their bond is strong, and the scenes featuring them were very sweet. Ian and Barley are incredible characters that you can grow to love with. Tom Holland and Chris Pratt did a terrific job on their characters.SPOILER:The ending scene of the movie shows how much chemistry they have together throughout their entire lives and that they, in fact, love each other. Ian, during the entirety of the movie, didn't realize that all the things he wanted to do with his father was already done with his big brother, and that point just hit me right in the feels.The other characters of the movie were fantastic and memorable. Corey the Manticore was a fierce and fun character. I liked the scenes with her and the mom. They were a pretty dynamic duo, and they worked quite well together. They made a good team. I absolutely loved the mom. She was a sweet, kind, protective, and determined single parent who was trying her hardest to raise Ian and Barley without their father being around. Unlike other Disney parents who will only appear in a few scenes, she was actually active in the story and the adventure. Noticing that Ian and Barley were gone, she joined up with Corey to find them. Disney needs to keep making parents relevant to the plot so we can see how their characters are rather than just leaving them out of the story while the main characters go on this grand adventure.The dad was an interesting character in this. He didn't do much, but I was fond of him despite his lack of hearing, seeing, and talking. In some parts, you can tell what he was feeling based on his body language or in this case, ""leg"" language. The bond between him, Ian, and Barley was tender at times. In other parts, he was just there, and I couldn't tell what he was feeling and that. I wanted to explore more of his personality and character. And since he was basically the main focus of the movie, I thought we would get flashback scenes of him or him and little Barley, but we didn't get those. I would've loved seeing those; it would display to audiences who the father was and capture his background and genuine personality. But I'm totally fine on what we got in the movie. He was great enough for me.SPOILER:I was disappointed that we didn't get to see the father's face in the end of the movie. It only showed his backside. I mean, the scene with Ian watching his father interact with Barley was touching enough, but it would've been even more emotional if Ian personally meet his dad for the first time. I was expecting that, but things turned around. I really wanted to see his face.Colt Bronco was ""meh"" for me. He was just your standard cop character. I don't like that he's the mom's boyfriend. In my opinion, it could've worked better if they were both single. Their relationship added nothing to the plot. I know that the mom was independent in the movie, but she would be even more so if she stayed single. Just a thought. Also, he was kind of bratty. He called Barley a ""screw up"", which was not nice of him. It even made Ian to believe that Barley was one. His character obviously could've worked better.The animation was incredible. I loved the designs of the characters in the movie, and the variety of creatures got their own, unique features. Each species had their own style. Like I mentioned before, whenever the characters would pop up, you could just see the little details of their skin or fur. Pixar has really improved since 1995. The different sceneries and areas that Ian and Barley went to during their big journey were really interesting and glamorous. I was consistently hooked onto the lands. The modern timeline with mythical creatures is a good approach, and I definitely approve on that. The animators have outdone their selves with the animation, and I give them props for that.The story was plain, but anyone could easily follow along with it. It's just about these two, teenage elf brothers who are trying to bring their deceased father back to life with magic. Basically, the story is just a huge road trip/adventure movie. I love animated adventure movies, so this movie appeased me. The modern timeline with mythical creatures is a good approach. The story featuring anthropomorphic creatures living in modern society has been done many times before, and that topic in Onward reminds me of Zootopia. I love the story, but it's not the best one to tell. It's different, and Pixar is trying something new, and I'm glad about that. It's not as good as Coco's story, Pixar's other original movie back in 2017, but I adored the plot.Last but not least, the music was magnificent. It was so catchy and adventurous, and it perfectly matched the consistent tone of the movie. It knew when to be loud or soft and gentle. The music was mostly an adventurous genre, and sometimes, the pitch and sound of it could make me shiver with excitement or make me have goosebumps on my skin. Mychael and Jeff Danna are amazing composers. They did an excellent job on the music. I listened to the soundtrack last night, and I loved it a lot.Overall, it was a cute, sweet, funny, and emotional family-friendly movie, and I totally recommend it to anyone who loves Disney, Pixar, and adventure story movies. This is a movie I would totally want to go watch in theaters again.",Onward

724,aireachail,Bringer of Tears,9,8 April 2020,"Yup! It's what Pixar excels at; connecting the feels. As with most Pixar movies, seeing it a 2nd time just makes it so much more impactful.Unlike my experience with other Pixar movies, this one I needed to see a 2nd time for me to truly appreciate all the thoughtfulness they've put into this one. Knowing what I know from watching it the first time really puts a difference feel to watching the boys and what it means to each of them to see their dad again and what they want to share with him.Absolutely a great movie.",Onward

741,danikaneill,It hit me in all the right places,9,23 December 2020,"Onward is a mix between a coming of age story and a roadtrip story that lightly touches on subjects such as;dealing with a parent's new partnersingle parentingfeeling out of place or subparnot fitting the mouldsibling squabbles and being embarrassed by a siblingbeing afraid to take chancesgrieving in different wayssaying things we don't mean when we are hurtDnD *cough* *cough*Just to name a few, these topics are well blended into the film.The film contained a message from Dan to his brother, as he based the main protagonists; Ian after himself, and Barley after his brother. Although, anybody who has lived similar situations can see themselves in the duo. That's why it hit personally hit me in all the right places. I was taken in by my great grandmother and my cousins and sister played a huge role in shaping me into the person I am today. They were my Barley growing up.I think it's important for stories like this to be told, as many adults, teens, and children, have and are currently going through similar situations.Even if you've never went through a similar situation, you will find something to relate to. This movie is heartwarming and worth the watch.",Onward
742,horseriderel,The absolute worst ending I've ever seen.,1,6 April 2020,This is supposed to be a child's movie? It's painfully upsetting and it has the worst ending. It doesn't resolve at any point. You get absolutely shafted by this movie. Heartbreaking in the worst way possible. Do not watch.,Onward
743,moonlafleur,Where magic meets science evolution.,10,19 August 2020,"As much as this movie is a coming of age tale for the younger brother, Ian Lightfoot, voices by Tom Holland (Spider-Man: Homecoming; Captain America: Civil War, Spider-Man: Far From Home, Avengers: Endgame); is as much as this is a story of self-discovery for his elder brother, Barley, voiced by Chris Pratt (Jurassic World, Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom, Guardians of the Galaxy, Guardians of the Galaxy 2, Avengers Endgame).In a world where elves, trolls, unicorns, and fairies exist, the magic of the world seems to be nothing but fairytales of the past. Barley has always believed magic was real, that the world everyone can see is only just the very top of the iceberg. His father believed it, too. But where Barley has four precious memories to hold of his father, Ian has none, their father dying before he was old enough to remember him. It is for Ian's sixteenth birthday that a gift from their father is presented to both the brothers, a gift that reveals what is hidden, tests the bonds of love and family, and sends two brothers on a quest into the unknown.With the sibling bond and familial love of Elsa and Anna from Frozen and Frozen II, the tale of self-discovery and coming of age of Tangled, and the emotional powerhouse of The Lion King (circa 1994), this is a movie that can be enjoyed by fans of all ages and will be an instant classic. Fans of The Last Air Bender and The Golden Compass are also sure to love this film.",Onward
744,j-muscolino,Okish but really slow moving,4,7 March 2020,"With the cast they had and the concept, I expected it to be more funny and fun, yet it lingered on and took a long time to get off the ground. Great visuals and animation, lacking in excitement and ultimately coming to a head in seemingly the last 30 minutes with some excitement and laughs.",Onward
745,dragonfire-20011,Onward to disappointment,4,9 March 2020,"Onward is PIXAR's latest IP directed by the bloke who made Monsters University. Now before I begin, I must address the enchanted elephant in the room. I can't speak for everyone, but I didn't see any trailers for this movie outside of the theater. Not a single trailer on youtube, no adds on any websites, or anything like that.
I only knew this movie was coming out, because I saw the trailer for it in theaters seeing Jumaji next level. Aside from that there's been nothing but silence. Maybe that's the clue that indicates that PIXAR doesn't have much faith in it. And if that is the case then, I can't blame them. Because I myself had little faith in the movie.
The premise is that; animated Tom Holand used magic to resurrect his father's legs. And sets out with his brother Chris Pratt on an adventure to somewhere to finish resurrecting his dad for one more day. Wait, what? The spell only works for one day? Then what's the point of the adventure if the spell will stop working by tomorrow?!?
So because the father is just a pair of legs, the real emotional string to the movie's bow is the bond between Tom and Chris. They both play they're roles rather well. The connection between the two becomes rather emotional and well explored, but my major gripe is why I should care about their quest.
As I said their quest is revive their dad, even if only for one damn day. But I never knew the guy, so why should I care whether or not they succeed in reviving their dad. Ultimately I just wasn't invested. I won't say I didn't like it, quite the opposite.
The world building is fantastic. Its a world that once believed in magic, but strayed from that belief once technology advanced. Its really similar to our world, and how our society was and is now. We use to believe in witch craft and magic herbs, but now know more practical fields of medicine, like painkillers and other things that cause addiction. And the bond between the brothers is well presented enough to get me to see the movie towards the end, but I have no incentive to see it ever again.
So while I can recommend that you see Onward, I have little to incentivize that recommendation. I'd summarize Onward as a pringle, you'll enjoy it but you may forget all about 10 minutes later. Unless you're writing a review on rotten tomatoes. The final score for Onward is 4 out of 10: rather bland. Certainly better than CARS 3 and Monsters University, but again that's not saying much.",Onward
