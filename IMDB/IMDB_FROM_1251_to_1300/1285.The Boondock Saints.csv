0,SnoopyStyle,violent cult movie,5,19 December 2016,"Gay FBI agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe) investigates two dead Russian mobsters. The local incompetent cops assume a mob hit. Brothers Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy MacManus (Norman Reedus) confess and Smecker determines self-defense. The news declares them Saints of South Boston. The brothers are joined by low-level Italian mob worker Rocco as they go on a religious crusade against criminals. The mob assigns feared assassin Il Duce (Billy Connolly) to take out Rocco before he can turn state's evidence against them.This is violent. While the violence is filmed with lesser skills, it does have a kind of stylish glee. The editing leaves the story a bit disjointed. The brothers could be appealing characters and Dafoe is a compelling actor. Agent Smecker takes a strange turn which does not serve the movie well. The character Il Duce could be interesting but I question everything done with him starting with the comedian Connolly. There is a fine line between cult movie and camp. This one straddles that line and could be considered both.",The Boondock Saints
1,kosmasp,Gods bloody path,9,22 July 2007,"It's the German title of this movie! Not exactly the same as the original title, but still a fun one, for a B-movie, that can get to you! I can tell you, it got to me! Apart from the actors (especially the two main characters mentioned in the title and Willem Dafoe), it's the really crazy story ... and maybe the attitude (Don't give a damn), especially when it comes to swearing and/or the action scenes! Unfortunately this attitude represented also the directors attitude, which cost him a sequel and us (fans) a follow-up to this crazy movie (in a good sense of course)! Boondock Saints is bloody and violent, I can't say if the documentary ""Overnight"" is similar (it was supposed to be the ""Making of"" Boondock Saints 2 and became the recorded downfall of Mr. Duffy) ... I haven't watched it yet!",The Boondock Saints
2,classicsoncall,"""This is like Lone Ranger heavy, man!""",8,5 July 2017,"Say what you will about Willem Dafoe, but he really puts himself out there for his craft. The gay scene with the Asian in bed and the one where he dresses in drag to go up against the Russian Mafia are just hilarious in a movie that's really not supposed to be. I also got a kick out of Smecker's (Dafoe) thoughtful ruminations while regarding a crime scene to the strains of some operatic aria while his detective cohorts can't make heads or tails of what they're investigating.The MacManus Brothers (Sean Patrick Flanery, Norman Reedus) have the words 'aequitas' and 'veritas' tattooed on their hands, the justice and truth they both search for as their personal honor requires taking on a mission from God. But these are no Blues Brothers, their mission is one of vengeance and retribution after Russian mobsters decide to take over their South Boston hangout. The brothers are aided in their quest by a maniacal numbers runner (David Della Rocco) who was set up by his own boss just to see how far he could get taking on the mob guys by himself.I have to admit, films like this are a guilty pleasure when it comes to bad guys taking out even worse guys on the pretense of providing a greater good. Paul Kersey and Dirty Harry did it all the time, so why not a couple of good old Irish boys in the tradition of Charles Bronson and Clint Eastwood. This is an offbeat gangster flick that doesn't have a lot of credibility going for it, but that's not what you sign up for with ""The Boondock Saints"". With this one, the hits just keep on coming.",The Boondock Saints
3,gavin6942,Cult Classic With Good Reason,7,2 January 2010,"The streets of Boston... who knew they were such a violent place? Besides the Irish hooligans, there seems to be an influx of the Russian mafia. Well, the police don't seem to be doing much about it, so enter the McManus brothers: they are about to become homegrown heroes as the Boondock Saints, and they don't give a damn about following the rules.This film, after bombing in theaters, become a cult classic in the world of rentals. My friend Nate got a tattoo based off this film, and there's at least one band that has sampled the memorable line ""There was a firefight!"" For years, many had recommended this one to me, and I never got around to it. But then when my friend Melissa suggested it, I was quick to give it a try, as I respect her opinion for some reason. It was a good idea, as the film is very enjoyable.Critically, the film is not very well-regarded, in contrast to the fan base. I'm not really clear why. The primary complaint seems to be that it's nothing more than one violent scene after another with little plot. I think that's a valid concern, but exaggerated, and it ignores the fact that the violence is really the central theme of the film. The Saints can do what the police cannot. And like ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"", this film appeals to those who like mob and crime films, not someone who wants a complex drama.There's plenty to enjoy besides the glorious violence, such as Willem Dafoe's unusual FBI agent character that is almost psychic and has a love of cross-dressing. And there's some moral and ethical questions here. We generally accept that murder is wrong, but what about here? If the Russian mafia can be brought to trial and released by corrupt judges, traditional justice cannot keep them from returning to a life of crime. Does this open the possibility for vigilante justice and murder of the guilty? I think this film is worth watching. I did not get around to it until ten years after its initial release, and it lost nothing in the process. This is not a 1990s movie, or a movie that would appeal to me only ten years ago. It is as strong now as it ever was, and will likely continue to be strong. If you don't like blood and potty language, avoid this one... but beyond that it's pretty intense in its awesomeness.",The Boondock Saints
4,moonspinner55,"An insult to Irish-Americans, gay FBI agents, and Mafiosos everywhere!",1,13 May 2007,"Wretched mobster drama set in modern-day Boston has Irish-Catholic twin brothers (meat-packers who are fluent in just about every language!) practically applauded by the police and the media for taking out a couple of Russian Mafiosos; pretty soon, they're ridding the city of all crime czars, and a fey, gay Fed wants in on the excitement. Dreadful, insulting script begins badly and keeps getting worse, and the overscaled performances (which would be broad at fifty paces) are shoved right up to the camera. Writer-director Troy Duffy hasn't any talent working with actors, and this cast is strictly on their own (which may explain why Willem Dafoe turns in his very worst performance). Duffy is no De Palma, and ""The Boondock Saints"" is no ""Scarface"". It may well be the most misguided mobster-drama ever made. NO STARS from ****",The Boondock Saints
5,Quinoa1984,the flamboyant style and few drops of originality brushed over,3,23 August 2005,"The Boondock Saints was a film a couple of times while watching it (not early on, but midway through and around the last twenty minutes) I wanted to turn off, but I didn't as I wanted to see what might happen next. Perhaps that's from the crime/action film fan I am, but the set-up to the film is a hook: the MacManus brothers (Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus) are regular Catholic church-goers who also frequent the local pub. One day, after contemplating that God does not rid the world of the ones who are really the wrongdoers, they go out and do it themselves- quasi-vigilantes with a kind of spiritual morality at their sides. The mobsters that they're wiping out are connected, and it leads to an investigation being started by the eccentric/gay Detective played by Willem Dafoe, and also an all-out-war escalating with the hiring of a crazy killer (Billy Connolly) on their trails. So, for the first fifteen to twenty minutes of watching the film, the hook had me in, and while I didn't think of it as particularly dynamite film-making, it did attempt at a realistic beginning of the lead's lives and conflicts. This, unfortunately, did not hold. The problem with how The Boondock Saints unfolds is that at many points in the film it doesn't know how to balance the elements of comedy and tragedy, and gets morality mixed up in it all. One reviewer said its like Natural Born Killers with a moral. But un-like NBK, the film doesn't have any particular 'point' to make, up until the end which becomes very muddled. For example, the Willem Dafoe character- he plays this role wildly, sometimes smoothly, and in some scenes he basically held the framework together. But the script doesn't give him much else to go; is he funny, operatic, for real? Writer/Director Troy Duffy has him chasing his tail every which way. Unlike in a smarter, more experimental film like NBK, Duffy in an ironic sense plays it safe with the story. The script has also been compared to Tarantino, and that is a relevant comparison to make. The film-making style itself is not necessarily a QT knockoff (too many big-style camera moves, and a poor soundtrack sorry to say, there isn't much patience or true daring), but the script does have that sort of realm of it. The F-word is tossed around like candy; the bad-asses in the film are made out to look like 'real' bad-asses (see Connelly, one of his oddest roles); and there is plenty of action to go around (although I'd say, at least in comparison to Pulp Fiction, that had less action, with better results than this film). I wouldn't mean to make comparisons, but it would give people a better idea the near naivety of the filmmaker towards the audience. What's the moral in the end anyway, that justified killing is OK if its connected with Catholic revenge and justice? Whatever points are being made in the film are made early on and then lost in most of the second and third acts. It's not that there isn't some talent in Duffy's writing or direction, or that the actors don't do what they can. Yet there is such a kind of formula to it as well, even in the more unexpected scenes. The Boondock Saints does have its cult audience out there to be sure (some consider it one of the best films ever made), but it is too 'cool' and 'smart' for its own good. It's like the horse that you're friend wanted you to bet in on, and then after its impressive first stretch it folds, and then trips over. I almost wished at times I could like it more while watching it, but I also know that there are better, and less exploitive, original genre films out there.",The Boondock Saints
6,wes-connors,Down in the Boondocks with Troy Duffy,5,29 November 2010,"""When the sadistic Russian mob starts muscling in on their South Boston Irish neighborhood, Connor and Murphy McManus (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) know what must be done. Feeling that the vengeance of God is flowing through their veins, they set out to rid the streets of gangsters, criminals, and lowlifes. As the body count rises, the brothers became local heroes. Now, one unorthodox FBI agent must be cunning enough to bring them down,"" according to the film's distributor.Trouble is, detective Willem Dafoe (as Paul Smecker) agrees with the vigilantes! and so would you, as evidenced in the film's coda.Troy Duffy's ""The Boomtown Saints"" challenges the Catholic Church's observance of the ""Thou shalt not kill"" commandment. It's an effectively stated thesis, but not new. The violent style is reminiscent of Quentin Tarantino's groundbreaking ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992). Indeed, you're advised you will ""thrill to the action, intensity and intelligence of this modern day morality tale written in blood"" if you took pleasure in lying with ""Dogs"". One of the gory highlights involves a hot iron, but with no sizzle.The nicely-cast brothers could have stood a little more characterization. Coming on like a masculine David Bowie, Mr. Dafoe telegraphs his character's big secret (if it is one, hard to tell) too early; he keeps his ties clean, too. With an uncanny ability to make hair-conscious henchman Ron Jeremy and hungry mob boss Carlo Rota laugh at bad jokes, ""funnyman"" David Della Rocco and the crew have enough fun to make it occasionally contagious - if you like catching this sort of sickness.***** The Boondock Saints (8/4/99) Troy Duffy ~ Willem Dafoe, Sean Patrick Flanery, Norman Reedus, Billy Connolly",The Boondock Saints
7,Theo Robertson,Indulgent Cultism,3,6 December 2012,"When this film was first released it was hated by most critics and did very poorly at the box office . Over the years THE BOONDOCK SAINTS has built up a very loyal cult fan base who adore the film and sung its praises . To be honest I do like vigilante movies where good villains redeem themselves via the use of torture , mutilation and bloody murder against bad villains . It's a rather self limiting genre of course since there's only so many ways you can kill evil people . I thought because of the good word of mouth I might be watching something along the lines of TAXI DRIVER with Celtic accents but after seeing the film just before the festive period I realised I'd just been fed a total turkey Director Troy Duffy knows he's making a cult film and over does it big time . The cops find a couple of bodys down a Boston alleyway and it's not enough for the investigating detective to be some quirky caricature - we need to see FBI fed turn up in slow-mo and steal the scene in a display of over indulgent campness . Willem Defoe does indeed steal the scene and the whole film but this isn't necessarily a good thing because you have to remember that he seems to be doing a bad Gary Oldman impersonation and that there's not much of a film to steal in the first place A lot of people who disliked the film have stated that it seems like a bad Tarantino wannabe . It's true that there's a lot of bad language and much of the humour arises from the language , but it's slightly misleading to dismiss it as being a Taratino clone . PULP FICTION has a similar sort of quirky nature but the overall feel of PULP FICTION is still one of seriousness . In this film it's consciously not serious . In short it's a film impossible to believe in and if you're looking for a modern day TAXI DRIVER you're going to be seriously disappointed",The Boondock Saints
8,utgard14,Shallow and Stupid,5,26 January 2015,"Yeah, this is one I just don't get. It's got something of a cult rep but I fail to see why. Maybe it played better at the time. I'm certainly old enough to have seen it when first released but I only got around to seeing it recently. It's a movie full of ""characters"" played by actors that are always trying too hard to camp it up. It's a Tarantino clone and, as such, you would expect it to have more style and maybe some good dialogue. But it has little of that. And I'm being generous by saying little instead of none. It just isn't funny and its vigilante message has been done before and better so it doesn't even have something new to say. The action is uninspired; just lots of shooting. Big whoop. I'm giving it a middle ground score but just barely. It's a pretty overrated movie, at least as far as IMDb is concerned. Nothing memorable about this, good or bad.",The Boondock Saints
9,zardoz-13,"Exciting, Hilarious, Subversive, but Worth Watching Twice Or More!",10,13 March 2010,"Bartender turned director Troy Duffy's contemporary action melodrama ""The Boondocks Saints"" bears all the influences of Quentin Tarantino with its ultra-violent shoot-outs, use of profanity, over-the-top situations, fractured time lines and gallery of memorable characters. Two multi-lingual Irish lads from South Boston awaken one day after they hear the Lord tell them to hit the vigilante trail. Actually, despite its far-fetched storyline, ""The Boondocks Saints"" spouts the message that evil flourishes only when good men look the other way. Duffy hammers this theme home in an early scene when the minister recaps the real-life tragedy of Kitty Genovese. In 1964, Genovese was raped and murdered near her home while thirteen eyewitnesses cowered in either fear or indifference to her plight back and did not intervene. Consequently, ""The Boondocks Saints"" advocates vigilantism. Unfortunately, whatever credibility that Duffy generates for his message is obliterated by those kinetically staged gunfights, rampant profanity, and the melodramatic plot twists. Basically, ""The Boondocks Saints"" is a beer & pizza saga that shows some tolerance for homosexuality because one of its chief characters—an erudite FBI agent—is gay but not gay is an over-the-top way. Sadly, this independently produced actioneer got lost in the politics of its day. According to Duffy, the Columbine massacre prompted the distributors to curb release of the film because of its violent fare. The heroes—who perform primarily good deeds—dress in black like the Columbine gunmen and wipe out Russian mobsters galore. Nevertheless, this ranks as first-rate entertainment if you enjoy gritty gunplay, provocative characters, and some surreal staging. People who love cats may not enjoy ""The Boondocks Saints"" because a cat is accidentally shot and splattered like a tomato against a wall. Of course, the actual cat was never harmed, but some cat lovers cannot differentiate between reality and illusion so this film may leave a dire taste in their mouths.The Cold War has concluded and Russian criminals have migrated to America and the Russian syndicate is buying up property in Boston, much to the chagrin of some leaseholders, like poor old Doc (Gerard Parkes of ""Short Circuit 2"") a barkeeper afflicted with Tourette's syndrome who runs McGinty's Bar. The patrons are celebrating Saint Patrick's Day when three imposing big bruisers, among them Ivan Checkov (Scott Griffith), walk in to lay down the law and encounter the McManus twins, Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery of ""The Suicide Kings"" ) and Murphy (Norman Reedus of ""Deuces Wild""), who precipitate a barroom brawl with them. They tied the biggest Russian to the bar and set his butt on fire. The next day two of the Russians, including burnt butt, barge into their apartment. They handcuff Connor to a toilet and threaten to kill Murphy. Connor rips out the toilet—possible but not likely—and goes to the roof and drops it on the biggest Russian and saves his brother from certain death. FBI Special Agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe of ""Platoon"") launches an investigation because he is part of the Organized Crime Task Force. Smecker hooks himself up to his portable CD player, pops on his disposable gloves, and analyzes the crime scene to the strains of classic composer Puccini's operatic La bohème. Although the chronology of the scene is fractured like a Tarantino bloodbath, Duffy appears to invoke the kind of cross-cutting that worked so well for Hong Kong director John Woo so that we get to see both the crime and the analysis of the crime. Later, when Smecker presents the details of the crime to his colleagues, he is in the same shot with our heroes when they perform their community service. Our heroes give themselves up and Smecker lets them go and informs the Boston press that they killed the Russians in self-defense. Later, our heroes hear voices and believe that the Lord wants them to destroy evil men. The MacManus brothers receive help from one of their loony friends, David Della 'Roc (David Della 'Roc' of ""Jake's Corner""), who serves as an errand boy of sorts for the Boston mob. He provides our heroes with all the information that they need to start wiping out mobsters with extreme prejudice. Roc is the crazy one of the bunch and he lacks the focus of the MacManus twins. Meanwhile, Smecker investigates each convoluted crime scene and shows the Boston Police, particularly the three detectives on the case, Dolly (David Ferry), Duffy (Brian Mahoney) and Greenly (Bob Marley), why he is such a genius. By now, our heroes have become 'saints' in the newspapers, and they obtain a cache of silenced automatic pistols with which to carry out their work. When they ice top-level hoods, Connor and Murphy utter a prayer while they have their victim on his knees and shoot him through the back of the head so that their bullets exit through the eye sockets. Afterward, they place pennies on the dead man's eyes. Each execution gets wilder and crazier until the mobsters catch up with them. Meanwhile, Smecker has so underestimated the MacManus brothers that he never imagines what they have been doing until Roc loses a finger during a shoot-out and he connects them with Roc. By this time, the mob has declared war on them.""The Boondocks Saints"" is for action-oriented film fans who know they are only watching a movie. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are perfectly cast as brothers and they kindle a lot of charisma as vigilantes in the tradition of Charles Bronson from the ""Death Wish"" movies. Make no mistake, however, Willem Dafoe and David Della 'Roc' steal the show. Close behind them in his peripheral role is Gerard Parkes who has only a couple of scenes, but he is unforgettable, especially with his use of the F-bomb and the A-word followed in rapid succession. Mind you, ""The Boondocks Saints"" is not remotely believable, but it is a terrific, entertaining, action-packed opus with colorful character, blue dialogue, and Duffy's imaginative staging.",The Boondock Saints
10,Calicodreamin,Unexpectedly good,7,28 February 2020,"I was pleasantly impressed with the quality of this movie. The acting was good, the plot just far enough out there to be interesting, and there was a fair bit of humor. The characters were relatable which made it easy to get invested in the storyline. There were a few unexpected turns and I enjoyed the way the plot gracefully jumped ahead and back with each crime scene.",The Boondock Saints
11,Boba_Fett1138,Definitely entertaining.,8,9 September 2008,"OK so ""The Boondock Saints"" is a ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" wannabe, like so many other films but in this case it's a good wannabe that definitely entertains.It's definitely not a movie to take serious, even though it still picks a gritty and realistic approach. This is typical for recent British film-making and something they master. This production is American though and also made by an American director but it still uses this same typical distinctive British style with also British actors and characters in it. The end result in this case is a light-hearted, entertaining movie, that is professionally made.Not sure if I really like the main story of the movie, which glorifies violence and killing but it provides it with some nice and original sequences. It picks an original approach by sometimes using action flashbacks of what happened when the police investigates the crime scene, while still focusing on the linear storyline. This is a spectacular and original approach which often works out surprising as well as awesome. I think its approach is the foremost reason why ""The Boondock Saints"" works out so well and gives it its own identity and style.The movie is also really made great and interesting by the fact that it has Willem Dafoe in it in a great role. Seriously, I feel like it's one of the better roles out of his career. Couldn't care more or less about Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus really, who play the main leads of the movie. Billy Connolly also plays a fun role, although his role is much smaller than you perhaps would expect.A perfectly entertaining movie to watch.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",The Boondock Saints
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Great unusual action film,10,8 February 2004,"Very intelligent action movie, about two Irish brothers who kill 'sinners' to punish them. The movie is a bit different from the typical action movie, as it doesn't have car-chases or explosions. The action consists of stylish shooting sprees. It also has a fairly original idea that is utilized in nearly every action scene in the movie, and that should be used more often in action films; first you see the aftermath, the crime-scene, the police investigating, counting bodies, etc. After/as the police come up with theories to the crime, we see the actual scene, of the brothers punishing criminals. It's a different kind of vigilante movie. It's particularly gory and bloody, but this just makes it all the more realistic. In real life, there is a significant amount of blood when someone is shot in the head. The movie has some Christian subtexts, I think I've heard about five major theories about the whole movie's meaning. This shows, in my opinion, that there was obviously a lot of thought put into the movie. I'd recommend it to anyone who can stand the gore, even if they aren't Christians. 10/10",The Boondock Saints
13,view_and_review,A Fun Movie,7,20 March 2018,"The Boondock Saints is about two modern day purveyors of justice. Almost by accident two Irish Catholic brothers find themselves cleaning up the streets of Boston one criminal at a time all the while the police and a hotshot gay FBI agent are on their trail. They stay one step ahead of both the bad guys and the cops as they take out the trash.Who doesn't root for someone cleaning up the streets? It's bloody and a little sanctified in a sense that they have made themselves into judge, jury and executioner but it is also refreshing. The movie is somewhat light for such heavy violence and shooting. It is a fun movie.",The Boondock Saints
14,ferguson-6,I wanna be Tarantino,7,2 June 2003,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Heard about the upcoming sequel and decided to see the first on DVD.  Kept thinking through the whole movie how this director was just itching for someone to say it was as good as Tarantino.  Plenty of violence and offbeat characters - especially Dafoe as a psychic, psycho FBI agent who listens to opera while recreating the crime - at a WARM crime scene.  Anyway, some decent action, ridiculous dialog and wild gunplay make this watchable, especially for the high school boys.  Nice touch with Billy Connally as the end all assassin.",The Boondock Saints
15,trashgang,over-hyped,7,8 December 2013,"Yeah I know I'm showing off but I met the two main leads in the flesh and even as Norman Reedus is famous for The Walking Dead nowadays still people are standing in cue to meet the famous Boondock Saint. Can anybody telling me what i am missing about this hyped flick. The only thing we see is that the two youngsters are only out for justice and are killing the bad ones. Sure, there are a few good things to say about the script. It's well done, seeing how the police thinks how the killings happened and then showing how it was done and after a while we actually see the deed with the copper looking how they are killing people but it surely isn't a Pulp Fiction (1994). It is brutal in some ways and I was looking out for the more bizarre Rocco (David Della Rocco) who sometimes really goes bonkers. Those are the most gory and funny parts and did remind me of Pulp Fiction, remember the car scene were the gun goes off without wanting it, here we do have it with a cat. Teenagers will adore this brutal flick but I'm not afraid to say that I didn't found it that great. The acting on the other hand was great especially Willem Dafoe (Paul Smecker) was wonderful, as always.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 1/5",The Boondock Saints
16,christopher-underwood,"whilst I can understand the appeal for some, its not for me.",6,3 March 2021,"After the first twenty minutes or so of this, with an unfunny scene in an Irish bar culminating in a fight with some pantomime Russian mafia guys and the aftermath, I was ready to pack this in. Then Willem Dafoe turns up as the big police cheese and his amazing performance is transfixing. He completely dominates the screen but when he is not featured everything falls away again and we await his return. It is an astonishing performance, including the most bizarre cross dressing sequence but a feeling develops that it is such a shame the rest of the film was more eloquent. Sure, there is a lot of shooting and killing - actually apart from a few church bits and a little torture, this is all shooting and killing, apparently played for laughs. I'm afraid I did not raise a smile and whilst I note that the movie bombed on its theatrical release, this was primarily because of the fallout from the Columbine High School massacre. Since then a keen audience for the film has grown and whilst I can understand the appeal for some, its not for me.",The Boondock Saints
17,StevePulaski,They're on a deadly mission from God,7,13 February 2012,"Cult films are some of the worst films to review. Especially when they've been out for many years and people have already formed strong, incorruptible opinions on them. I sometimes feel almost obligated to award a cult film a very positive review because I don't want to face the backlash from fans and then be dismissed as someone who can't appreciate ""cult art."" I've seen my share of cult films that I wholly love, like The Rocky Horror Picture Show, some I found acceptable, The Big Lebowski, and some I didn't quite grasp, Wet Hot American Summer. The Boondock Saints is a cult film I just can't bring myself to say I truly enjoyed.To be fair, it has a lot going for it. The plot itself is very slim, focusing on two brothers, Connor (Flanery) and Murphy MacManus (Reedus), who are strictly Catholic and enjoy cursing and shooting. Seems like a contradiction. One day, while celebrating St. Patrick's Day, they are approached by three Russian mobsters who want to close down the bar they are currently partying in. The next morning, they are brutally attacked by the same trio, and the brothers wind up killing the mobsters in an act of self-defense.The pair decide ""we're pretty good at killing, let's become vigilantes,"" and thus the movie takes off. The merciless scenes of brutality are often interrupted by an effortlessly fantastic Willem Dafoe playing FBI Agent Paul Smecker, the man working the case of the two men.From there on out, it's shoot, run, jump, duck, reload, turn on the slow motion, and repeat. The cinematography is top-notch and well worth noticing. It's the thing that kept me interested the whole time. The first couple of scenes involving violence were nice and somewhat new because slow-motion technology wasn't a very ordinary thing (it didn't become fully noticed until a couple months later with The Matrix). Ultimately, these scenes wear out their welcome pretty quickly.Willem Dafoe plays a pretty convincing agent, and both of the brothers do a very fine job at acting, but the nail in the coffin is it is shamelessly inspired by the work of Tarantino. The attempts at witty dialog, the gratuitously violent set-pieces, and the overall look and feel all appear to be directly lifted from films like Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. The Boondock Saints knows how to incorporate style and look to a film, but struggles to include anything unique or memorable in terms of storytelling. It also doesn't possess half the amount of with that made Pulp Fiction so stellar. Even the God-fearing duo reminds me of The Blues Brothers. It could be possible that these brothers are on a deadly mission from God.The film also woefully misses its chance at throwing in some commentary on vigilante justice and whether or not it should be welcomed or feared. It just feels like it is trying to cover up the actions of the two or justify them by saying ""yeah, they kill a lot, but they're very religious and attend church often, so at least they sort of resemble good, wholesome people."" The Boondock Saints isn't a bad film, but shamelessly overrated in terms of quality. It's the underdog of American cinema, becoming a runaway success on video, but was the success worthy for such a film that, truthfully, isn't as unique or as entertaining as the title and plot suggest? The performances are great, some scenes are worthwhile, but the depth is kiddie-pool deep and the film makes a lackluster attempt at justifying itself by adding no serious commentary on the issue of vigilante justice.Starring: Willem Dafoe, Sean Patrick Flanery, and Norman Reedus.

I can't stop thinking about it. My friend in my communication class had used the movie as a speech, and she showed the court scene. I was confused, but it seemed like a great movie. I had to see it.

Okay so the premise of the film is about 2 Irish-American brothers Conner MacManus(Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy MacManus(Norman Reedus) who are blessed by God or they are portrayed to be, going around killing evil men. The movie also has some similarities with some comic books especially the characters, which isn't a bad thing since the direction they go with it, isn't very realistic and far fetched like some comic books. The main complaints for me is the character Rocco, the guy is one obnoxious and annoying weasel. And to top it off he is on the good guys team or anti-heroes to a degree, plus you just end up disliking him compared to every bad guys in the film. And it seems the director rushed the ending when wrapping it all up. To sum it up your either going to worship it, like it or hate it.7.9/10",The Boondock Saints
22,thesar-2,They're No Saints,2,29 August 2009,"Though, I admire its ambition, this amateurish piece of work is quite literally a bloody mess. 'The Boondock Saints' wants to be 50 things; it's as if the director/writer (also well known prick) Duffy tried to put all of his ideas in one screenplay, knowing this would be his last film. (I stand corrected; he has, to date, 2, if you count the sequel to this movie.) It almost was his last movie. SEE: the documentary on this film: 'Overnight.' And I had. Years ago, but now finally got a chance to see the movie it refers to. Honestly, 'Overnight' was 4x the movie this was, but that's another review. In 'Boondock' we have two Irish brothers who amazingly speak 60 languages, but that's an irrelevant part of the plot, and stumble upon a life of vigilante violence against the mob and a FBI agent, who happens to be gay, but that's irrelevant part of the plot. I could go on and on about what's irrelevant, so I will stick with what's relevant: enormous stereotypes (Willem, please, please tell me you don't think all gay men talk with their hand on their hip), enormous overacting or simply no acting during numerous sloooooow-motioooon shots (heck, there are plenty of scenes people are just reading lines vs. acting them out) and enormously unbelievable leads as, I guess, superheroes to the community. Style is thrown in here, there, different angles used, then straight forward shots. Almost nothing is consistent in this film. Again, it's almost as if Duffy had a hundred of ideas roaming around and had to fit them all in. I was waiting for cartoon elephants to appear to guide the so-called ""saints.""

They turned themselves in and were released as heroes. They then see it as a calling by God and started knocking off mafia gang members one by one. Willem Dafoe plays the detective trying to figure out the killings, but the closer he was to catching the Irish brothers, the more he thinks the brothers are doing the right thing I was bored senseless by this ""supposed"" cult classic. It's flamboyant, raucous style was not too my liking. Dafoe in my opinion delivers an an annoying, OTT performance that only made me annoyed by the film even more.Performances Willem Dafoe is one of my favorite actors but I hated him here. He was way too OTT in my opinion, over acting his role to epic proportions. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are both annoying leads, who I didn't get all the hoo-ha about.Bottom line. I've avoided the sequel for good reason. I'll see it sooner or later but after this disappointment I don't have high hopes for it. Loud leads, dull pace and overacting ruined this one for me.

25,The-Sarkologist,The question of vigilantism,8,6 December 2013,"There is something about the vigilante that we as a society actually like, and it is interesting that there are many pieces of literature that are based around a central character who is actually a vigilante. I was going to suggest that most superhero comic books are like that, but while I am not big on comics, I do realise that a lot of them are part of some government organisation (such as the Avengers from Marvel Comics and the Justice League of America from DC comics). However, there are two superheroes that clearly are vigilantes and we are quite familiar with both of them – Batman, and Spiderman.This film is about a couple of Irish boys who, after an altercation with the Russian Mafia, decide to become vigilantes and go about executing all evil men in Boston. They start off with the Russian Mafia, but after a good friend of their's gets set up by the mob, they decide to use his inside knowledge to track down and eliminate every member in Boston.One of the things that this film highlights is the restraints that the law enforcement officers have when it comes to dealing with crime. Even if they manage to locate and arrest the head of a crime family, their connections, and their wealth, is generally enough to keep them out of gaol. However, vigilantes have no such restrictions, and I guess that is why people appeal to them – namely because they hunt down evil men and seek to make society a better place.The only problem is by what authority does the vigilante have to determine the guilt or innocence of another person. Certainly a lot of people they deal with have long sordid histories, but if they are simply going on the information of a single person, even if that single person is a friend, what is there to say that this information is actually correct, and that the friend is not using them to settle some old scores? The problem with vigilantism is that there is no method of judging guilt or innocent, no avenue for mercy, and much of the evidence is based upon either speculation, or tainted opinion. Further, if the only authority that is given to these vigilantes is the authority given by themselves (even if they claim that the authority has come from God) what is to stop others from also taking up the mantra, and once again, what gives them the ability to determine guilt and innocence. The problem with the idea that God gives a vigilante the authority to hunt evil doers is that the bible also says 'do not judge lest you also be judged'.As for a movie, I actually quite liked this movie. I liked it when I first saw it and I liked it when I saw it recently. What I especially liked about it is the way that the action sequences are actually pieced together after the fact by the police, who wonder around the murder scene and try to work out what happened. It is then only the correct deduction that is then displayed to us the audience to see.",The Boondock Saints

This sets the stage and the tone for everything that follows. Our two meat packing plant heroes, brothers Conner (Flanery) and Murphy (Reedus) McManus, find themselves at odds with a pair of Russian mafia types, who end up dead. Locals call the killers ""The Saints of South Boston."" ""Angels don't kill,"" argues Smecker (Willem Dafoe), the FBI agent sent to investigate the deaths. Throughout the movie, we see the aftermath first and then the action in flashback (more often than not pieced together by Dafoe). It's an effective way of presenting the ""mystery."" When the pair recruit Rocco (who accidentally kills his girlfriend's cat), he enthuses: ""We could kill anyone!"" Our ""Mass"" murderers step up the pace- but ""Il Duce"" (""The Duke,"" played by Billy Connolly), a killer so terrifying that he's trussed up like Hannibal Lechter, is on his way. Will our heroes survive...? THE BOONDOCK SAINTS is a well-crafted comedy/drama, with great music and performances all around (Willem Dafoe as the gay FBI agent is particularly funny when he dresses up as a prostitute; fugly, but funny; he's also brilliant in a slow motion sequence as he imagines and ""orchestrates"" a shootout he's piecing together). (Note: not long after the release of this movie, there was an incident in the news- and I heard it only once, and it was never elaborated upon- wherein a masked man with a mask and a CAPE used a shotgun in a similar real life situation.

32,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"The justice-seeking vigilante takes a new, ultra-cool form",8,6 April 2009,"Imagine Batman and Superman were two Irish Catholics from Boston that sprayed their hapless, costume-free villains with bullets. That's ""Boondock Saints,"" sort of a ""Guy Ritchie meets vigilante justice"" crime film that relishes in the cool rather than the real. Still, over- the-top as it may be at times, there's no denying ""Boondock Saints"" both its cool and cult status.Connor and Murphy McManus (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) are a pair of Irish fraternal twins with unflinching faith and a lot of body art who after an attack on their favorite bar by Russian mobsters on St. Patrick's Day goes awry, realize they can rid Boston of its crime filth, fulfill a religious responsibility and make some money on the side by killing sinners. On their trail is arrogant and borderline crazy FBI detective Paul Smecker (Willam Defoe), known for accurately reconstructing crime scenes (as long as he has his classical music handy).Once the McManus brothers go on their spree, the film takes an interesting approach, showing Smecker go through each crime scene and guess what happened before actually showing you what happened, increasing the suspense and getting across Smecker's frustration with how clean these guys manage to be.Although the plot and style of the film is dominated by the McManus brothers and their not nearly as sharp or morally sound companion Rocco, character-wise, this film belongs to Defoe. In his strongest character maybe ever, Defoe's distinguished and inherently insane features work perfectly for a detective who is so smart he's nearly a lunatic. His performance is nuanced at times and over-the-top at others and while the other over-the-top parts of the film detract a bit from it, Defoe manages to make his ridiculousness work, namely the cool scene where director Troy Duffy films both Defoe constructing the scene and the Saints actually doing all that, together.The film's greatest weakness is that it glorifies the vigilantism of the McManus brothers in a way that detracts from the realism. They become superheroes in almost too much of the sense of the word. Their clean kills and getaways, even their reception by the public (which is more told than shown) seems a bit too far-fetched. Even the symbolism is overdone with the twins' rosaries shaking on the wall pegs or thrashing about as they get beaten. The religious angle is highly controversial, but this is also the point. Never before has religion been a motivating factor in vigilantism in film. Still, the execution is more about style and entertainment than about the real possibility of these figures existing.",The Boondock Saints

Because I've always thought that you had to be the ideal accurate analyzer while talking about movies. They deserve that. But you know what, I have had it. And this time, let me scream: I HATED IT, THIS IS *VERY* BAD!I'm a scriptwriter myself, and how I just suffer to find a producer who wants to make my little foolish work. And now, I watch this trash, which is unbelievably the rock-bottom, the lowest known level of foolishness, and they DID it! That makes me so angry for sure. I think it happened like this: there was one idiot writer / director, who convinced some idiot producers, to make such nonsense. Well, it's the story of everyday, but in this situation, it didn't make my day!It's a wicked formula, a lousy recipe, a silly song that was played the way a crazy DG might play. It goes like this: A lot of pure violent killing scenes, co-called creativity in making them (by flashbacks!), a flood of ribaldry and perversity (because decency is dead, and normality isn't in fashion anymore!), and some premise in the end to make everything look good for the thickhead critics!However, as a very poor viewer, I didn't find anything to love, to enjoy, or even to see (Willem Dafoe as a prostitute?! Oh God, that was so horrible!). As a scriptwriter, I didn't find anything to be happy about. And finally, as a critic, I didn't find that decent thing to talk about. Yes, there was that war of the minority's gangs, the achievement of the lost justice as a mission from God, the media's mania over those saint killers who never kill an innocent soul. But give me a break. The try of being serious in this movie looks like a good joke!Just imagine how funny this movie would be if any censorship wanted to delete the (F) words, or the (S) words, out of it. That would help it to be a lot funnier, with BEEP BEEP all the time! Or let the Chinese people take the movie, and play with it like (Steve Oedekerk) did with (Hu hao shuang xing - 1977) in his movie (Kung Pow: Enter the Fist - 2002). In fact, a Chinese comic copy of (The Boondock Saints) can be better, a real useful thing!These days, I get disgusted out of putting an operatic singing, or classic music, in the background of the killing scenes in any cheap movie, to insert a sense of holiness, or elegize the human civilization, or imitate (Stanley Kubrick) in (A Clockwork Orange - 1971), or anything!And if this movie wants, by its weak ending, to make a satire for the American system which creates such a bloody phenomenon, or the media which glorifies it in unintentional way, then this movie, by its very own logic, is one of those celebrations of those killers, or a crime in itself, especially with this long free show of executions, and the absence of a serious study for such disturbed men or society. It's a crime movie that tries to have a diligent substance, but ends up as sickeningly violent video game with a fabricated satire. So it's not that meaningless movie, it's a meaningless movie which alleges having a meaning, and that's the worst kind!Finally, I don't see this as an ugly movie.

36,billcr12,Brilliant,9,1 June 2012,"Possibly the best action movie with the worst title, in history, The Boondock Saints kicks ass. Conor and Murphy McManus, the brilliant Sean Patrick Flanery(later, so good in Powder), and Norman Reedus, are two good Irish Catholic boys, who, after attending mass, stop at a bar to celebrate St. Patrick's Day. While tossing back a few, they witness three Russian mobsters threatening the owner with plans to close the place for land development. A brawl ensues, and the Soviet bad men attack the brothers at their apartment. The Celts kill them and are then targeted by the associates of the dead men.Willem Dafoe appears as Paul Smecker, a gay FBI agent who gets the case and he finds that the pair of vigilantes have become public heroes. His first interview with them reveals the fact that they have been taught several languages, so that they can communicate with the Russian criminals easily. A low level mobster errand boy, Rocco joins the boys after they receive a message from God to kill the wicked, so that the innocent will flourish. They obtain automatic weapons and kill nine of the Russians, including the boss, Petrov. They shoot him from the back of the head at an angle, so that the bullets come out of his eyes. They then place coins over the eyes to pay the toll for the River Styx; very poetic. The killings escalate to the point where a big boss, Papa Joe, hires an infamous hit man,Il Duce, to execute the two heroes. The assassin is played by Billy Connolly, who is brilliant, and a big secret is revealed, which is a stroke of genius by the writer-director, Troy Duffy. A definite Pulp Fiction influence can be seen in Boondock Saints, and it is equally entertaining.",The Boondock Saints
37,freemantle_uk,Oh When the Saints Come Marching In,4,17 February 2012,"There is big divide of opinion between critics and audiences about The Boondock Saints: critics hated it when first released and The Boondock Saints has a 17% rating on Rotten Tomatoes but audiences loved it, having a 7.8/10 on IMDb and has become a cult hit. But I side with the critics about this film and there are some detractors even in audiences.Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy MacManus (Norman Reedus) are two Irish Catholic brothers living in Boston and workers in a meat packing factory. After an altercation with some Russian gangsters which result in the brothers having to kill in self-defence. They soon discover their have a talent for killing and put it to good use to get rid of all the evil of the world, killing gangsters, perverts, rapists, murderers, etc and believe they are doing God's work. But by doing this they upset the Russian and Italian mafias and an FBI agent, Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe) is investigating their crimes.The Boondock Saints is basically a poor man's Quentin Tarantino/Guy Ritchie film, failing to match on a plot, comedy, action and dialogue level. The acting throughout is horrendous, either lacking any conviction or very over the top, though Dafoe did at least looked like he was having fun. The action was filmed in a slightly stylised fashion and competently handled but Troy Duffy overused slow motion like he was Guy Ritchie or John Woo but did not have their experience. The actions are not even filmed as they were happening, they were filmed as flashbacks and Duffy just fares to black to show a show the passing of time which felt very lazy. The gunplay was strong.The jokes, comedy and the comic performances just fell flat. It was poorly written, not funny and the dialogue was a poor attempt at copying Tarantino and Ritchie. There is no real understanding how to make a action-comedy. There are tonal shifts from it trying to be a light hearted romp to being a very violence dark fest, an example being the brothers kill their targets gangland style, shooting them in the back of the head at point blank range. The MacManus use religion to justify there actions and there is a very right wing slant to this film. It would have worked better if the brothers were villains, using religion to justify their actions, manipulating religious text as a justification and the police have to investigate.The Boondock Saints is not the almighty classic that some people think it is.

38,Polaris_DiB,Entertaining and blunt movie,6,26 March 2009,"The 90s can almost be defined as a slew of zany action comedy movies with quirky fast-talking characters. Tarantino and Ritchie stand out as possibly the most lasting of the filmmakers operating under this style, but The Boondock Saints, I've found, has some real legs in terms of how long its lasted as a cult product.If Tarantino is screwball, this movie is definitely slapstick. Most of it is nearly all physical humor. The playful narrative structure going back and forth through time is also used to create probably one of the greatest sight gags in cinematic history, as the action is presented while Willem Dafoe's FBI investigator pantomimes it in the same frames. Definitely some classic set-ups, and if Duffy had Sayles and Powell in mind while he was filming it, I gotta give him a pat on the back for parody.As for the story, though, it's a little strange. This is definitely a movie for the pure blissful entertainment of it, so I know it's not trying to make any, for instance, deep statement on the act of vigilantism. However, it's still a little disturbing. Each character in some way has to go through a moral crisis in understanding the vigilantism occurring--except for the vigilantes themselves. The two Irish brothers are essentially Superman--their characters need not and do not change, everyone else apparently has to adjust to them. Again, I know that the concerns of the movie are not such that this is an issue for the script, but for me I found it a little weird. I'm just sayin', is all.Otherwise, it's a comforting movie in its lack of subtlety. Everyone speaks with exaggerated accents as becomes their character, you get to see David Della Rocco go postal, and you get fire-y action with equally as rapid-fire back-and-forth dialog. Sweet! --PolarisDiB",The Boondock Saints
39,dee.reid,Holier than thou?,10,1 June 2006,"I guess it'll take a while for the effect to where off. I saw the unrated edition of ""The Boondock Saints"" two days ago and I'm still reeling in from the experience, which is surreal, to tell you the truth. Quite frankly, a movie that is this sharply written, acted, and directed is a true rarity these days. Writer-director Troy Duffy dives into the murkiest depths of the ""law,"" and its apparent futility in modern times, and how it takes two Irish fraternal twin brothers, Conner and Murphy (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus - both of whom are a little too convincing in their roles), to stir up enough debate about vigilantism to become media heroes. The release of ""The Boondock Saints"" was sidelined in 1999 because of the Columbine massacre and the plot about Conner and Murphy being on a mission from God draws some eerie parallels to the motives of Columbine killers Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold. As the film opens in Boston after St. Patrick's Day, Conner and Murphy get into a bar-room brawl with a couple of Russian toughs and said toughs are discovered the next morning in an alley in piles of their own blood and guts. FBI agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe) shows up on the scene to show the local cops a thing or two about criminology and theorizes it was a revenge killing. Soon enough, both injured brothers waltz into the police station and claim self-defense. They're let off after a night in jail (plus experience a cathartic jail-cell baptism) and no charges filed. But soon, more bodies turn up, and Smecker learns that Conner and Murphy (and a third, David Della Rocco) may be the ones behind the mayhem on the streets. Duffy's film is a bloody one (most of the gruesome violence is extended in the unrated special edition), with a cackling screenplay that includes 246 uses of the f-word and assorted Irish-Euro-slang, and has earned a fearsome reputation in recent years and has been embraced as a cult phenomenon. (It's easy to see why, if one is a fan of relentless violence and bloodshed. P.S.: The action is so balletic in its style and excess that it's almost reminiscent of a John Woo picture.) I can't believe I stood away from this movie for so long, darn it! The opening moments don't prepare you for what comes up next and even though the action (which there is quite a bit of and, as stated earlier, is extended in the unrated version) is quite bloody, there's a morbid sense of humor running throughout the carnage and I fell out laughing on more than one occasion during this picture. And still, there is a sense of beauty and tragedy underlying much of the action in ""The Boondock Saints,"" and its ending will certainly leave a bitter taste in the mouths of some. Lastly, I would recommend reading up on as much about the controversy surrounding ""The Boondock Saints"" as one possibly can; it'll make the experience much more hypnotic.10/10",The Boondock Saints
40,drqshadow-reviews,"Packed With Plenty of Panache, But Not Enough Weight",6,10 April 2012,"I find it interesting that so many parallels are drawn between this and Pulp Fiction, because beyond the genre staples and one or two racy taboo-challenging scenes, they don't have all that much in common. The Saints don't benefit from the comparison, either, considering Fiction is an ambitious, label-defying, scene chewing mega-monster, while they're just suitably entertaining bullet spitters with an accent. There's plenty of good action to be savored here, with a few wildly original payoffs and an upturned barrel full of blood'n'guts, but at heart it's an extremely simple vigilante justice story that's well-served by its hair trigger. The two leads, twin brothers who seem to have been waiting their entire lives for the excuse to go on this kind of a rampage, power through wave after wave of mafia underlings without even a whiff of danger until the closing moments. That makes for some giddy action sets early on, sure, but when the story is finally ready to slow down and say something, it's left without anything to lean on. Willem DaFoe is a potential show-stealer as the morally (and sexually) confused police detective on the Saints' case, but he falls victim to the same trappings as the plot. Loaded with character, bravado and personality, it lacks depth and meaning.",The Boondock Saints
41,XweAponX,Incredible Director!,10,19 September 2007,"Someone gave me this title on a DVD- As I sat down and watched it, I realised that this film is the best directed film I have ever seen.I did not know what to think of it... I had never even heard of this flick until someone put the DVD in my hands. So, I wanted a second opinion, and I showed it for my good friend who knows more about movies than that guy on TCM- He was riveted, the guy has the attention span of a gnat, and if the moovie we are watching ain't great, he stops watching it and starts fiddling with his laptop, and he'll never look at that particular film again.Not so with Boondick Saints: He had his eyes forward all through the thing, never turned his head, never uttered a word... Duffy really hit it on the head with this, and after watching the deleted scenes on the DVD, it becomes apparent that the editing is equally phenomenal. That's all we can say about The Boondock Saints: A phenomenon.Now, regarding the things that were cut, and I understand that Duffy had an extraordinarily difficult time with the MPAA regarding certain ""shots"" (Literally, the shots of bullets entering heads)- But the MPAA, in trying to hamper Duffy, actually improved the work, and elevated it to ""Fantastic"" status... ""Fantastic"" and ""High Level Cult Film"" status. I enjoy Directors Cuts... As in Pete Jacksons director's cuts of LOTR and King Kong (and as an aside, I would like to see an extended cut of The Frightners) - But this film is a container and you can't open it and you cant add anything to it... The only thing you can do is make a sequel, and I hope Troy is able to do it.This is a compleat story, it is fated to be told exactly the way it is told from start to finish. When the film is done, the tendency is to watch it again instantly. Ergo, the need for a sequel IMMEDIATELY!Duffy was handed a raw deal when he was making this moovie, and he is being handed the same shaft now. I think Duffy can be making moovies that are better than any Scorcese, Tarantino, Rodriguez, or Iñárritu film: But instead, Hollywood is handing lots and lots of money to very lousy directors to make movies based on VERY poor scripts: When they COULD be backing Troy in a sequel, at least.Damn their Eyes for their stupidity!

43,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Cult classic for good reason. Rip roaring action cinema.,10,24 March 2016,"The Boondock Saints is an interesting movie for me, as it's kind of evolved along with my consciousness as I've gotten older. Some films you initially dislike, yet they grow on you gradually until you see them in a new light. Some films you are crazy about right off the bat, yet over time the attraction dims and you realize you don't really care for them anymore. And then there's this one. While I can't say I've grown to dislike it, because that's just not the case, I will concede that as I've gotten older and new information on it has crossed my path, I've come to regard it in a new light. Also, the parts of my personality which went ape crazy for anything pulpy and crime ridden back then have receded a bit as my tastes matured. But try as I might, I can't bring myself to completely see it in a negative light, despite recognizing certain negative aspects of it which were once not so obvious to me. Saints is a tricky film because on the one hand you have the rabid fans who make up the cult following and have brought it the infamy it has today, as well as it's sequel, which is really not that great. On the other hand you have the lofty monarchy of high film criticism, bashing it six ways to Sunday, the bad taste of it's conception and production still on their tongues. Recently I watched the documentary Overnight (a biased film with its own glaring issues, but that's another story), which chronicles the meteoric rise and fall of director Troy Duffy, who foolishly squandered a gift horse with immature and selfish behaviour, or at least that's what the film shows. The film had the potential to be a big budget flick with huge stars involved and the backing of Weinstein. That never happened. Duffy's ego swiftly sent the script into oblivion, until it finally got made years later for less than half the original offered budget, and landed in film purgatory before being squeaked into a meager distribution. A tragedy, say some. But.. is it though? Fate is a strange beast, and if everything went according to plan, we'd have a slick studio monster that might have been good, and no choppy, unique cult favourite to gain unprecedented momentum decades after its chaotic birth. Some food for thought. Anywho, on to the film. It's low budget for sure and one can tell it's made by a guy who's never directed before, but it's got a silly, cartoonish charm and cinematic flair for style that will keep you watching. Two rowdy Irish brothers named Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy (Norman Reedus) accidentally kill some scary Russian mob soldiers in one of the most inventive scenes ever staged, and they discover they have a spiritual affinity for knocking off evil men. So, with no tactical experience whatsoever, they set out on a mission from God to end the lives of the Boston criminal underworld. Dragging their hapless, lovable buddy Rocco (David Della Rocco) along, its only a matter of time before the law tags them, and soon they have loony FBI honcho Paul Smecker after them. Willem Dafoe has to be seen to be believed in what is a career weirdest for him. He plays it like the Joker crossed with Bugs Bunny, never allowing an ounce of restraint or subtlety into the performance. I'd be interested to see the actor/director relationship which led to getting something this zany in the can. Smecker struggles morally, part of him believing the Saints to be a necessary force. They are faced with Italian mafia bosses including a scuzzy Ron Jeremy and Carlo Rota as Giuseppe 'Pappa Joe' Yakavetta, a ham fisted Don who wants the Saints gone. Rota is the only one who comes close to matching Dafoe's maniacal energy, playing Yakavetta to unhinged, mustache twirling delight. Reedus and Flanery hold up their end with physicality and quite a lot of energy, making the McManus brothers two fun protagonists to hang around with. Billy Connolly shows up as Il Duce, an almost invincible assassin from hell who proves to be quite the obstacle for our boys. The concept for the film is relentlessly juvenile, and the action set pieces veer into silliness quite a bit and there's a slapdash, haphazard feel to the whole thing, an unfinished varnish, or lack thereof to the whole process. It's just such lurid, reckless fun though, filled with excessive profanity, comic book violence, laughable religious symbolism and deeply questionable morals that seem to have been penned by an eighth grader who's just completed a John Woo and Charles Bronson marathon back to back. This is a movie that loves the fact that it's a movie and acts accordingly, throwing everything it can get its hands on at you and yelling "" Look! Look how cool I am"". Is it cool? Up to you. It's certainly one you won't forget about. It almost ducks the 'good film' litmus test in the sense that you'd be wasting breath in claiming it's a bad movie. It couldn't care less about that, and the fans, of which I have to say I still am, seem not to either. It's not really good, bad, terrible or anything. It's just The Boondock Saints.",The Boondock Saints

46,drystyx,"too bad, this could have been good",6,29 July 2011,"In fact the movie should have been good. It had a good soul. It had a good idea in two underdogs against the Mafia. We even had a semi super star in Dafoe, certainly one with great charisma. In fact, the leading actors all had great charisma. This would have been an epic film in the hands of someone who would just emulate de Mille a little.But Troy Duffy did absolutely everything horrible. Talk about the opposite of de Mille, and that's why it flounders.We begin with the worst music score since ""A View to a Kill"". The music is one horrible cliché after another, and makes you wonder if it is a comedy. If so, it fails. Duffy never commits to either comedy or action, and that's okay, as long as you know how to inter-splice comic relief. You don't have to follow the Shakespeare formula as closely as the old great directors and writers, but you have to at least be coherent.This movie lacks any coherence, in every way.It is a botched job of directing. We could blame the editing, but the editing is so consistently pathetic, we have to admit it is the director's hand in this. When you have to have a scorecard telling you what is going on, when you have to have a TV set at the stadium to see the ball game, when you have to sneak in your own refreshments, when the fans are mumbling and making unintelligible sounds that give you absolutely no clue as to what is going on, there is no reason to go to the stadium.The movie drags at a horribly modern pace, too. Again, these incompetent directors need to learn from the masters like de Mille and Ford, directors who knew how to keep your interest, who could keep the flow going.There is no way a person can watch this without fast forwarding. It can't be done by someone not on serious drugs. If I was a narcotics officer, I would immediately arrest any one who I witnessed watching this all the way through, because drugs would be GUARANTEED to be found in their system. Of course I couldn't sit and watch a drug crazed zombie watch it all the way through.And it really is too bad. This should have been a good movie. It had all the promise. If only Duffy didn't believe in modern clichés so much, if only a real director and writer could have done this.",The Boondock Saints
47,Witchfinder-General-666,We Get It: Tattooed Irish Twins = Cooool,3,28 February 2008,"""The Boondock Saints"" is one of those films that have achieved an enormous cult-status over the past few years, and even though I can see why some people like this film, its cult-status is not at all justified in my opinion. Not that the movie was entirely bad. I actually found it to be quite entertaining, but the obvious (and constant) effort to create the hippest thing in the history of motion pictures was quite annoying and, as far as I am concerned, it had an opposite effect. Sure there are certain ingeniously funny elements (such as a stuttering bartender who suffers from the Tourette Syndrome), but then again, there's at least as many 'hip' elements that are annoying more than anything else. Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy (Norman Reedus) MacManus are Boston Irish brothers who work as meat-packers (in spite of their ability to speak dozens of languages). When Russian mobsters try to take over their favorite bar on St. Patrick's Day the brothers successfully fight back, and they are henceforward acclaimed as 'Saints' in their neighborhood. Their sudden 'saints' status gives them the idea to cleanse the district of the mob entirely...There are several points that I liked about this movie. It is quite bloody, which makes it more entertaining in my book. There are also some interesting characters, my favorite being 'Funnyman' (played by David Della Rocco), a long-haired and full-bearded small-time crook with an anger issue. He's a buddy of the MacManus brothers, who are well-played by Reedus and Flanery, but whose exaggerated coolness begins to annoy at times. Irish folks are cool - that's one of the central messages in ""The Boondock Saints"". Now what about two Boston-Irish brothers sporting huge rosaries and 'meaningful' tattoos saying ""Veritas"" and ""Aequitas"" - That must obviously be as coool as it gets. The two also have a strong tendency for semi-religious drivel, which is to make them even cooler (I guess). Apart from the phony coolness, the story (which starts out OK) keeps getting dumber and dumber throughout the film. What annoyed me the most is the narrative style that resembles a video-clip. Director Troy Duffy has been compared to Tarantino, but I assure that these comparisons are unjustified. Adapting tarantinoesque elements is legitimate, of course (even more so since Tarantino himself is a master of tributes). The mere fact that he adapts some of these elements, however, doesn't make Duffy some kind of new Tarantino. Still, ""The Boondock Saints"" is an often amusing film. The performances are satisfactory. Reedus and Flannery are good enough in the leads, and David Della Rocco is quite funny as their irascible sidekick. The cast includes the great Willem Defoe as a gay, slightly nuts FBI agent, pornstar Ron Jermey as a mobster, and Billy Conolly, who always delivers solid performances. The blood-soaked action sequences are entertaining enough and the film has a certain sense of humor, and even gets hilarious in some parts. I cannot say I didn't somewhat enjoy watching ""The Boondock Saints"". As far as I am concerned, however, the film does not deserve its status as an acclaimed cult-flick. It is slightly entertaining at some points, but it is definitely silly and immensely over-hyped!",The Boondock Saints
48,Jonny_Numb,further proof that any movie featuring Ron Jeremy is no good...,2,30 June 2006,"As I checked ""The Boondock Saints"" out from my friendly college library, I was told by an IFL teacher that the film was ""very popular among male college students."" I believe she excised the end of that phrase, which was probably: ""...under the heavy influence of several pints."" After hearing a lot of word-of-mouth recommendation (including a former drunken college roommate) for the past few years, I finally broke down and picked it up. Regardless of how good or bad ""Boondock"" wound up being, I would at least be able to say ""I saw it."" (Someday, I hope to have that etched on my tombstone.) And exactly how bad is ""The Boondock Saints""? (Puts on Professional Party Pooper Hat) Pretty damn bad. Here we have a movie that tosses the stylings of Tarantino (""Reservoir Dogs""), Rodriguez (""El Mariachi""), Woo, Scorsese, Winner (""Death Wish""), Stone (""Natural Born Killers"" in particular) and even Singer (""The Usual Suspects"") into a blender, and the end result is uniformly awful all around.The Plot: Sean Patrick Flanery (proving there's no life after ""The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles"") and Norman Reedus (""8mm"") play devoutly religious Irish brothers living in Boston; when the Russian mafia begins to infiltrate their territory, they become relentless vigilantes, not only offing the Russians, but any generic scum who crosses their path. In an outrageously flamboyant performance, Willem Dafoe (who provides the film's only glimmers of humor) plays an deductive FBI agent who pieces together the crimes. The plot, however, is such a mess--perhaps deliberately so--that the film jumps from one clumsily-executed setpiece after another, pinning us to the wall with so much badly-edited 'action' that one questions whether the filmmakers were so naive to think we wouldn't take notice.As written and directed by novice auteur Troy Duffy, ""The Boondock Saints"" is pretentious, would-be crime thriller dreck that carries a pungent aftertaste of arrogance on the filmmaker's behalf. The film is ineptly edited, poorly acted (everyone kicks 'shrill' and 'shouting' up to the highest possible decibel), lazily satirical (""Death Wish"" and ""Natural Born Killers"" did it first, and--mostly--better), and--for all the slow-motion action contained within--no fun to watch. Potential stabs at humor are lost in the sea of poor sound recording and even worse accents (sheesh, could it be any more obvious that Flanery and Reedus ARE NOT Irish?). The one 'joy' of ""The Boondock Saints"" is watching Willem Dafoe wig out grandly in a role he probably thought would never see the light of day, but even his presence doesn't elevate this above borderline-unwatchable 'entertainment.'",The Boondock Saints

50,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,Irish Actioneers,6,19 June 2013,"How often does a viewer get a chance to see an Irish character on screen that fights for good? There have been Irish actors who portray other ethnic characters but not Irish characters. It's actually kind of strange too because there are several Irish actors that could have been casted to use their real accents. Instead, two Americans star as the main leads. Whatever, I can deal with it.Anyway, the story is about two fraternal twins, Connor and Murphy MacManus, played by Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus who take it upon themselves to start their own crusade of killing bad guys just because, they're bad guys. It's a cool idea, who doesn't want the evil people off the face of the world? But here's where I get confused. It never is explained to why these boys decide to do this. Was there an event that happened in their past that made them change? Or was it self driven through pure excitement for the sake of killing? I don't know.I do give credit to Flanery and Reedus though for their acting. Because they're brothers, they will tend to act like brothers. For example, they do things synchronized and they tend to bump heads. That's fine because it allows them to become more believable to the audience. Their accents are also fairly well done for Americans too. But the weird thing is that even after all that, I really didn't care much for the duo. Accompanying them is an unstable Italian called Rocco played by David Della Rocco. Rocco makes his character unstable by giving him emotional spikes of anger and happiness. This is goofy and should create charm but for me, I didn't get attached to him either.Following their trail of hits is FBI agent Paul Smecker played by the usually chaotic Willem Dafoe. What people should like about Dafoe's performance is how well he is able to use his deduction skills to show not only his fellow cops but the audience as well to how the MacManus brothers carry out their business. It's really cool how he can figure that kind of stuff out. What was even more interesting was how the scene was setup. First the audience will see the aftermath, then Smecker will go about what he thinks happened and then a flashback will occur showing how the event actually happened. It will keep audiences locked to the screen.However, one character I found the least compelling was Il Duce played by Billy Connolly. There was a tiny back-story about him but it still never explained to how he seemed all too familiar with the MacManus brothers. That also wasn't explained well. Lastly, the music was rather average. Jeff Danna, who isn't a novice to this kind of job mixes rock with electrosynth and opera. In places it works and it others it doesn't which left me feeling indifferent about the film as a whole. The opera part I felt was a little too much. It should satisfy viewers but not to the highest degree of entertainment.These Irish mercenaries are cool to watch in action along with their detective counterpart played by Dafoe. Just don't expect much explanation for anything when it comes to characters.",The Boondock Saints
51,winner55,allegory: Medieval knights in pea-coats with guns,10,30 July 2006,"First - what is this film really about? Towards the end of the last century, only two cities in America had an ""Irish mob"", Boston and Brooklyn, and Brooklyn's was fading fast, caught up in smuggling in easily identifiable illegal aliens and smuggling guns back to an IRA that's no longer even all that popular in the north.. During the 1980s, an enterprising FBI agent got it in his head that the way to contain the Italian mob in Boston (which was still strong on the docks) was to pay the South Boston Irish mob to rub them out. The scheme not only proved ineffective, but surfaced publicly and created quite a scandal. Several films were made about it; besides this one, the only other film loosely derived from the event that I've seen is ""Southie"". Most of these films - including this one, have taken an odd tact - they have concerned themselves largely with two questions: First, what does it mean to be ""Irish American"" in the post-modern era, when no American gives a damn about Irish ancestry anymore; and second, what is the difference between Irish Catholicism and Italian Catholicism, as found in the underworld, which, after all, suffers from a want of morality all together.Those who've seen ""GoodWill Hunting"" will recognize the first question. Although the second question seems completely off the wall, it should still ring a few bells - remember ""Road to Perdition""? How about Ray Iotta's character in ""Goodfellas"" (he's never a 'made-man' to the mob because he's half-Irish)? Troy Duffy has made this second issue central and made the first dependent on it - what remains of Irish-American culture is derived from Irish Catholicism (this, by the way, is a very Irish view on the matter). However, being an Irish Catholic in America inevitably involves a certain amount of apostasy - i.e., transgressive skepticism - which, for every Irish American boy leads through a phase of a profound sense of undefinable guilt - God probably doesn't exist, but he's still judging us anyway. Eventually, there are only two ways to wrench one's self out of this guilt - through art or through laughter. Duffy is clearly using both.What Duffy has done is to take Irish Catholicism, sent it back to its roots in the later Dark Ages, dragged it through all kinds of post-modern angst (represented largely by Dafoe, but discoverable at virtually every turn), and resurrected it as an allegory of Christ's Passion represented as tale of Medieval knights in navy pea-coats with guns.Whew! But this explains why someone like myself, hardly an adolescent ""fanboy"", might actually like this film. The ironies are so rich, and so deeply embedded with history, that there's always some new twist on the ancient myths turning up at every moment. And the complete disjunction between the ancient myths and the post-modern world in which they appear creates a tension that cannot be resolved in the film itself, but must be left with the audience as a question.A violent funny gut-wrenching and disturbing film; a fine farewell to the last century, even if it bodes not well for the new.(Oh, and what IS the difference between Irish Catholicism and Italian Catholicism in the criminal underworld? In the old Irish ghettos you either became a priest, a cop, or a drunk; and later your mom made you feel bad for not becoming one of the other two. In the old Italian ghettos you became a drunken priest and shot the cop. Later your mom made you lasagna.)",The Boondock Saints
52,philip_vanderveken,It deserves its cult status,7,16 August 2005,"""The Boondock Saints"" is one of those movies that - despite its small budget - has made it to the status of cult movie. Many viewers liked this movie and I'm one of them. I'm not going to compare this movie with it, because I believe that every movie has the right to be judged on its own, but in my opinion it had some similarities with ""Falling Down"" and Quentin Tarantino's ""Pulp Fiction"", two of my all time favorites.When they accidentally kill some Russian mafia members, the two Irish brothers Connor and Murphy McManus are suddenly seen as the 'saints' of their neighborhood in Boston. Inspired by the will of God to get rid of all evil, they decide to go on a mission of their own. They will make the world a better place by killing bad guys. And everybody is convinced that these two man are doing a great job. Even the FBI agent Paul Smecker, who follows their trace of bloodshed, admits that the boys are doing exactly what he secretly always has wished to happen...If you are looking for a very realistic movie, especially when it comes to justice and doing the right thing, then this is definitely not the movie you are looking for. This isn't exactly some kind of court room drama in which the bad guys hear that they will have to spend their lives behind bars for many years to come. No, in this movie violence is the answer to their evil deeds. Personally I didn't have any problem with that, I'm already used to see it in other movies (like for instance the two that I mentioned above), but I guess that not everybody will be this tolerant.Although I don't know any of the actors, except for Willem Dafoe of course, I must say that the acting in this movie is more than OK. I really appreciated all the performances and especially Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as the MacManus brothers were interesting to watch. Overall this is a good movie, especially when you consider that this movie was shot with little money and unknown actors. It certainly deserves its cult status and it offers enough fun to make you forget about the fact that this is only a small production. I give it a 7.5/10.",The Boondock Saints

I was in high school and my friend was super-excited about some unknown movie he had seen at some random party in some other town. He was quick to show me the movie, and I gotta say, it was awesome.The movie follows Connor and Murphy MacManus, Irish brothers living out in Boston. After a run-in with a couple of thugs from the Russian mob, the brothers come to the realization that they've been given some kind of divine role as bringers of justice. From then on, they begin hunting down the mob scum of south Boston piece by piece with FBI agent Paul Smecker on their trail.You can't watch this movie without noticing the fantastic casting choices. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus have perfect chemistry as brothers, and Willem Dafoe is the highlight of this flick. Even unknowns like David Della Rocco have great charisma and keep you cheering for the Saints. The fantastic actors in this movie are enough to make you overlook Ron Jeremy's appearance (though his acting was perfectly natural in the Sin Bin scene, hah). On top of a fantastic cast, I thought the story was well written and I loved Troy Duffy's method of revealing the events in nonlinear fashion. The investigations made for some of the best parts.This movie has a great cast, cool action scenes, and humor. Honestly, I'm not surprised that this film became some kind of cult classic. I noticed when I moved out and went to college in 2004 that everyone owned a copy of this movie, as if it was standard issue. I'm not going to argue whether or not the movie is over-rated, because I feel it is.

55,sme_no_densetsu,Uneven and derivative but still entertaining,7,3 August 2014,"Troy Duffy was apparently trying to make the next ""Pulp Fiction"" when he put together ""The Boondock Saints"". A distinct Tarantino influence runs through the whole movie, from the subject matter, to the writing, to the visuals. While the resulting film is by no means a masterpiece, Duffy probably came closer than anyone (other than Guy Ritchie) to capturing the spirit of Tarantino's early films.Set in Boston, the story centres around Irish American twins Connor & Murphy MacManus, who decide to become vigilantes after killing two Russian mobsters in self defence. FBI agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe) is close on their trail at all times but he becomes conflicted about bringing them to justice. To his credit, Duffy did give more depth to the story than is typical for movies of this type but many viewers will probably just focus on the rampant violence.Unfortunately for Duffy, the cast that he had to work with wasn't exactly star-studded. Case in point, the titular brothers are played by Sean Patrick Flanery & Norman Reedus. Flanery managed to be a bit more convincing than Reedus but neither of them are particularly impressive from an acting standpoint. Much more memorable is the always reliable Willem Dafoe, who gleefully sunk his teeth into his caricature of a role. Also welcome in a small role was veteran Billy Connolly as the mysterious (and deadly) 'Il Duce'. The remainder of the cast runs the gamut from competent to downright embarrassing; however, Duffy should share some of the blame there for overextending in his attempts to mimic Tarantino's trademark dialogue.Duffy's first-time direction, on the other hand, is surprisingly ably handled even though his bag of tricks contains almost nothing that you haven't seen elsewhere. The soundtrack is fairly generic as well, though passable. The movie had a low budget, so I think that we got about as good a presentation as could reasonably be expected.Ultimately, ""The Boondock Saints"" definitely isn't a movie for everyone. It's known as a cult movie for a reason. While it's no ""Pulp Fiction"", I think that many people are over-critical of its failings. As I see it, the movie does some things right and it isn't as shallow as it's made out to be.

Because I never even heard of this film, the coworker's statement made me suspicious of its aforementioned greatness.After watching it, well, it's obvious to me now that the coworker is nuts, certainly if he watches this seriously derivative, over-directed bland effort once a week.I cannot remember seeing a film that was so devoid of any character, ideas, style, what-have-yas. The whole thing is sophomoric in the extreme and not in a good fun way but in a retarded, arrested development way. It's so bland and badly directed that I couldn't differentiate the actors from the sets. Everything melded in one ugly goo of awfulness.The only good thing about this disaster is the director won't be directing any movies anymore because of his stupid ego and his big mouth. The world has been spared!",The Boondock Saints

The film has some great moments, were you laugh out loud at the brother's incompetence, and their crazy schemes. William Dafo plays an intriguing character who likes to listen to classical music as he examines the crime scene..I thought that was a little bizarre but the whole film is weird.The film has some good strong elements, such as the comedy timing and the actors chosen to portray the characters, but at times the quirky element proves to be too much for the audience to handle.",The Boondock Saints

61,jaredmobarak,Evil is the indifference of good men,9,22 July 2006,"Why did Troy Duffy need to open his mouth and burn every bridge he had in Hollywood? After making an amazing movie like The Boondock Saints, more so for being his first feature film script and direction, fans are told a sequel, All Saints Day, is planned. Unfortunately no one will probably ever see that film because of Duffy's arrogance and pride. After being given money and trust to create the movie, he repaid his backers with public insults during his drunken stupors. It is a real shame as his talent is apparent and could have molded into something very good.Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are the MacManus brothers, two Irish boys that are highly spiritual and modestly intelligent. They live in virtual squalor, work at a meat factory, and drink with their buddies. After a self-defense killing, which triggered a shot of adrenaline against heavy odds to be victorious, they begin to believe they have a purpose on this earth. While spending the night in jail after the incident, to avoid the mob of reporters outside, the brothers both wake from a dream which gives them their duty, (from God?), to dispatch of the evils of the world. They become vigilantes, killing those dangerous criminals who once captured would eventually be let go by the system. Both are very good in their roles, using what they know of Charles Bronson and James Bond to get the job done. Each hit is done with folly and ""that only happens in the movies"" moments, but in the end they are completed professionally and effectively. The knowledge by the characters about their own blind luck is a nice touch and helps the audience go along for the ride as they never take themselves too seriously, except of course for the reasoning behind their murderous deeds.Although the two boys are the stars and drive of the movie, the outstanding performance belongs to the great Willem Dafoe. He plays a homosexual FBI agent named Paul Smecker and is always able to orchestrate in his head, along with the help of classical music through his headphones, every nuance of the past days' atrocities. Smecker follows closely behind the brothers trying to crack the case, slowly leading him down the path of reevaluating what it is his job truly accomplishes, and if these killers are actually doing more good than he. Duffy shows great visual flair showing Smecker as he reconstructs each crime. We always see the incidents through his eyes and not the MacManuses themselves. This style eventually gives us the best scenea fight at a poker game of criminals. Here instead of quick cuts between the orator and past events, we see Dafoe in frame, calmly narrating as the vigilantes do their work alongside. The scream of ""There was a FIREFIGHT!"" has amazing bravado and theatricality that would be laughable anywhere else, but ultimately poignant and fitting in context here.Along with one of Dafoe's career turns come some very nice supporting players. The non- actor David Della Rocco does an amazing job as the brothers' Italian low-level mobster friend, actually based on himself by friend Duffy. He is the ""Funnyman"" as he is called in the film, adding the best instances of comic relief besides the scathing retorts of Dafoe. His heart and naïveté help us understand our antiheroes' intents. They both protect him like a brother and try to show him that what they do is for good; they only kill evil men, those that laws can't seem to rid society of. We also get nice turns from Billy Connolly and Gerard Parkes. Seeing Connolly in a non-comedic role is a nice change for me; his remorseless assassin Il Duce is a brilliantly constructed character. I give full credit to the director for getting a performance against type from him. As for Parkes, from ""Fraggle Rock"" fame, we get nice comic relief with his stuttering, Tourettes afflicted bartender.The Boondock Saints is a high action, intelligently told story filled with violence, comedy, and drama. Duffy's style is uncommonly polished for being his first outing and it's a real shame that it will probably be his last. Hopefully, one day, he will become man enough to take the bullet and apologize for what he did, so that we can see what else is in him artistically. I haven't seen it yet, but the documentary Overnight tells the story of development and filming activities during which his descent into hell happened. A burgeoning cult classic, Saints will hopefully be remembered for the energetic ride it is and not the off-camera mistakes of its' creator.",The Boondock Saints

63,hall895,Going over the top can work sometimes,7,17 May 2010,"Ignored upon its initial release The Boondock Saints went on to become a cult sensation. People loved it, they thought it was the most amazing thing ever. Well, except for those who hated it and thought it was the dumbest, most vile thing they'd ever seen. Few movies split opinions to such extremes like this one. Love it or despise it, no in between. It's brilliant. Or it's hideous. So where does the truth lie? Well, right in between of course.The movie centers around Irish twins Connor and Murphy MacManus who will become vigilantes, taking it upon themselves to clean up Boston. Crime lords, thugs and lowlifes will be ruthlessly dispatched in extraordinarily bloody fashion. When the killings start FBI agent Paul Smecker investigates. The introduction of the eccentric Smecker, played to wonderful effect by Willem Dafoe, kicks the movie into high gear. The actors playing the MacManus twins, Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus, are perfectly fine but there never seems to be much depth to their characters. They have very little to do except run around killing people, moving from one bloodbath to another. It's left to Paul Smecker to pick up the pieces. And actually take some time to think. Nobody else has much time to think in this movie, they're too busy blowing people's brains out. Dafoe occasionally goes a bit over the top in his portrayal of Smecker but honestly this whole movie is about going over the top. Everything is big and bombastic. And bloody. So very, very bloody.Critics will say that the the movie is full of contrivances necessary to make the story work. That's probably true. Some will be turned off by the extreme violence. Some will argue that the whole thing is just one big bloody mess, nothing but a bunch of killing and cursing. It is all rather over the top. But is it too much? Probably not. The movie stops just short of going overboard. We identify with our young Irish vigilantes and root for them. Even if we're not quite sure we should. And even if their characters are never fleshed out particularly well. You really wish there had been more here in terms of actual story. What story there is often gets lost under seemingly gallons of blood. It's easy to see why people would love this movie. It's also easy to see why people would hate this movie. The truth is it's not the greatest thing ever seen, nor is it the worst. It's a reasonably good, entertaining movie packed with plenty of action. OK, it's over the top action but better that than no action at all. It's a movie which certainly has its flaws but there's enough here to make it work.",The Boondock Saints
64,CitizenCaine,"Entertaining, Ultra-violent Film",6,9 October 2003,"Sean Patrick Flanery, Norman Reedus, and David Della Rocco star in this Tarantino influenced, ultra-violent opus about two slaughterhouse workers and, what appears to be, a blood thirsty nut. They inadvertently come across a cache of guns and money, and are soon on a crusade to end the corruption and crime around the fair city of Boston. While pursuing their righteous aims, they, themselves, are pursued by a gay FBI agent played by Willem Dafoe. Along the way, they meet up with and dispense with a huge assortment of Boston's criminal element. While killing their targeted victims, they recite a prayer, adding to the bizarre picture we have in front of us. The Tarantino influences are here: Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. Director Troy Duffy's choice to use lesser known actors is a great decision, even though the budget probably dictated it. The violence is staged well and is comically operatic at times. The film is very entertaining and action-packed, but the reason for their sudden engagement in a life of retribution is never really clear. We never learn much about the characters either. The film does pose an interesting to the Dafoe character, that being the crusaders he's pursuing are doing the very thing he might be wishing he could do. The film raises very interesting points like this along the way, but never develops them beyond suggestion. Perhaps the sequel will, which is in production right now. Perhaps it will be just another kill-fest, which teases us with philosophical questions. Either way it's sure to be entertaining, although not fully realized. This is a surefire cult film with an interesting director to watch. **1/2 of 4 stars.",The Boondock Saints
65,fwomp,It's All About The Characters...,7,21 September 2006,"THE BOONDOCK SAINTS is a movie with some great characters and one big plot problem.The film's premise is interesting and gives a new take on an old movie theme: vigilantism. Charles Bronson of the DEATH WISH series rules the roost for such films, but all of these are seriously dated now. DEFIANCE (1980), starring Jan-Michael Vincent, was another great flick that focused on a citizen taking the proverbial bite out of crime in an otherwise corrupt neighborhood. So I was pleased to see something a bit fresher appear on celluloid with this oft-thought-of overused message.In The Boondock Saints we find twin brothers Connor and Murphy MacManus taking on the vigilante mantle by any bloody means necessary. And I do mean bloody. They also view themselves as instruments of God (as seen in the opening sequence in which they are in church listening to the funerary services for an innocent victim). Once on the streets, they tuck their crosses beneath their shirts and pull out their chosen weapons ...usually ones infused with gunpowder. They also say a special prayer before shooting their final bad-guy of the day, a prayer their father taught them. Oh. And their Irish, in case you didn't catch their last names. So we have to have the typical Irish pub in the area. And this is where much of the movie's success comes from. The absolutely amazing characters are what drives it.The pub owner is an old Irish coot who is being forced to sell his bar by the local Russian mob. But when the vigilante brothers show up and learn of it, they quickly make sure one of their favorite hangouts isn't manhandled by any outsiders. The Irish pub owner is thankful to the brothers, and it's amazingly funny how he thanks them because the old guy has Tourettes Syndrome (a tic disorder that often results in uncontrollable cursing outbursts).The Irish brothers also have a close friend named ""Funny Man"" Rocco (played by coked-out looking David Della Rocco) who has mob issues of his own. His ""boss"" is trying to rub him out and when Funny Man learns of it, he takes matters into his own hands as well as becoming a third party to the MaManus brothers' cause.Hot on their tails is flamboyantly gay FBI agent Paul Smecker, played by Willem Dafoe. It is Dafoe's character that really elevates The Boondock Saints to a higher level. His witty comments and astonishing detective abilities mixed with his social/sexual preferences are pulled off effortlessly. Watching him go over a crime scene while listening to opera is something to be marveled at.The downside is that this is a pretty bloody flick, spilling as much crimson as any slasher film. But the biggest issue some may have is that there's no background for the MacManus brothers. The audience never learns what trigger set them onto this path, so the viewers are just supposed to take what they're doing at face value. That's a pretty big pill to swallow. Set-up is important in the movies. But here's the thing. The Boondock Saints has such great characters, most watchers probably won't even notice this glitch.",The Boondock Saints
66,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"Well made and thoughtful, but not for all tastes.",9,1 October 2007,"Movies are sometimes misunderstood. Violent movies are often misunderstood. Not just any violent movies, but violent movies that are trying to say something about the violence that they contain. This film, I have a strong feeling, is one of them. I decided to watch it after hearing how ""kick ass"" it is. I am sure everyone, especially guys, enjoys ""kick ass movies."" I know I do. However, ""The Boondock Saints"" is much to thoughtful of a film to be labels just ""kick ass."" There is plenty of ass kicking, but that is not the point, to say the least.The driving of Connor and Murphy McManus to vigilantism is the point. The considerations of Agent Smecker on the ethics of what the McManus brothers do and why they do it is the point. The violence is incidental but nonetheless a necessary part of the film since the McManus brothers believe that their only option is to ""fight fire with fire"" - put down violent criminals the same way these criminals put other people. The religious themes throughout the film show that the brothers aren't just out for a violently fun time or ""kicking ass"" as they believe there is greater force driving them. One scene has the brothers cauterizing each others' wounds after a shootout which is a reference to mortification of the flesh - God permits them to use violence on the violent, but they must never forget: they are human. Also to be noted is the violence isn't portrayed gloriously or in a ""kick ass"" way though there are moments of deliciously dark humor. However, that again refers to the fact that the brothers are human. They smoke, they drink, they curse (like sailors!), they bleed, they like beer, etc... Not all humans are like that, but that's again beside the point.Another thing is Troy Duffy's script and direction. As of now this is his first and only movie, but it is directed with serious professional grace. The music, the slow motion scenes, flashbacks and whole film are just plain old well made and composed together. Naturally, there are many ways of philosophizing about violence and a violent movie is surely not in everyone's taste, but this is, above all, a well made and thoughtful movie. --- 9/10Rated R for strong violence and profanity.

67,EijnarAmadeus,Irish religion action,4,5 August 2004,"spoiler alert((( The Irish brothers Connor and Murphy live and work in Boston. Having the feeling of that God gave them the mission to get rid of all evil in the city. Becoming ""Saints"" after killing a couple of Russian mobsters, they set out to complete the mission. Having FBI Agent Smecker on their neck, who admits that the boys are doing exactly what he's always secretly wishing for, cause what they are doing is right eh? Connor and Murphy risking their lives for beliefs of Veritas and Aequitas...THE BOONDOCK SAINTS is a pretty freaking good action movie! Having the fabulous acting of Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as the two brothers and Williem Dafoe as the FBI Agent. The action scenes are truly violent and stuff, and this adds the truly spectacle of the movie's pretty bold messages. Having all evil men killed is a pretty heavy mission after all! The theme song is truly great, fine Irish melody rolling as the credits starts appearing. The pure - cool brothers wearing black coates and sunglasses and this cheap trousers makes them so realistic, gives the movie a very down-on-Earth aspect. The religious content and especially the brilliant finale. ""Do not kill. Do not rape. Do not steal. These are principles which every man of every faith can embrace""The movie was a huge pleasent surprise that off course never got a lot of media discussion, but the movie is truly a little masterpiece. Great scenes like the brothers hanging in a rope while firing maniac around them, killing man after man. And we've got David Della Rocco who plays the character with the same name, who's truly a insane, hairy guy that teams up with the brothers. You feel they're doing the right thing, but in the same time you feel guilty about it because it's truly a brutal way of scoring justice. Dafoe is also great as the gay-inspired Agent Smecker that really is fascinated by the team. The pure brutality, great soundtrack and the surprisingly fine acting makes this movie one of the finest of 1999. THE BOONDOCK SAINTS is a really great movie, no doubt about it! Having the Irish f**k-asses killed is a totally new consept, and having it succeeding like this is truly a joy watching. Sequel on its way. STARS: 4-5/5",The Boondock Saints
68,ofpsmith,Sloppy and gimicky.,5,21 July 2019,"For such a highly rated movie (7.8) I've seen quite a surplus of negative reviews. The Boondock Saints seems to be divisive among the general population, with people either loving it or hating it. I neither loved nor hated this movie. That's not to say that I particularly liked it either. People have made numerous comparisons between this and the work of Quentin Tarantino. After all, Pulp Fiction had come out only a few years previously so it would make sense to replicate it as much as possible. From both this and other movies I've seen that mimic Tarantino, it looks like a difficult game. After all, Tarantino's style is just a composite of various other styles of film anyways. I've seen it done well (Baby Driver and Bad Times at the El Royale) and it can really pay off to copy his look. The Boondock Saints does not pay off. And when it doesn't work, it really doesn't work. It's a shame because on paper this looked like an interesting story. But it seems to be so wrapped up and focused in its over the top style and characters that it just forgot to be a good movie. The Willem Dafoe character was especially ridiculous, behaving in ways that no FBI agent would ever act. It's not a cliche, it's just plain stupid. If you can get invested in the themes of justice and helping out your fellow man (even if the theme is less than subtle) than rock on. Enjoy the movie by all means.

70,gigan-92,"""For a few seconds, this place was Armagedon.""",10,30 January 2011,"I could quite possibly go on to write an essay on why this film is so intensely great. I'm surprised Troy Duffy hasn't sat in the director's chair again, although I am very anxious to purchase the sequel, which he did direct. Where to start, well obviously this film's amazing cast. One of my favorite actors ever, Willem Dafoe steps up and delivers a spectacular performance for a very original and genuinely well written character. Sure you could despise the film with all your heart for the fact that Dafoe is playing a homosexual, but that'd make you two things: (1) a very close-minded conservative and (2) a person who has no desire for originality and genuine character design in films. Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus have a natural chemistry that made it seem they were actually brothers. and were just plain bad ass through out. Billy Connolly is awesome in it as well. He has a majestic and menacing presence through out as Il Duce. And David Della Rocco was just great, playing 'himself' as Duffy would have it. He was just another well played and interesting character, one to truly remember in film history.Aside all the great characters, the movie has a very involving storyline and atmosphere. It's a very graphic, violent and intense one, yet along with it all is some very well placed dark humor. It all just feels so natural you'll be laughing constantly and embracing these characters. By the end of the film, I guarantee you'll be tempted to quote them. And to top it all off, the premise in itself is a statement. The message being that perhaps the reason the world is so corrupt and defiled today is because of the flawed justice system. Whether you view it as a well-themed masterpiece or a simple-minded action film is up to you, regardless the mark the film leaves behind is unmistakable.",The Boondock Saints
71,moviesleuth2,Awesome!,8,5 May 2010,"If you were to cross Martin Scorcese and Quentin Tarantino, you'd get something like ""The Boondock Saints."" True, the quality and skill are nowhere near the level of Scorcese's or Tarantino's best films, but that's okay. ""The Boondock Saints"" has no lofty goals. The only thing that the film is trying to do is create a violent, bloody adrenaline cocktail. And to that end, the film succeeds spectacularly.Boston, modern day. Criminals, mobsters and low-lifes are running amok. Two brothers, Connor (Sean Patrick Flannery) and Murphy (Norman Reedus) McManus are the brunt of the latest attack. But when they kill their attackers in self-defense, they're hailed as heroes. But after a number of other criminals start dropping dead by the truckload, agent Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe) begins to realize the truth: the McManus brothers are actually vigilantes.This movie is fun, in an extremely violent sort of way. The appeal of a revenge flick is to experience the thrill of giving the bad guys their just desserts. Stylistically, this is a triumph. The action scenes are beautifully done, and the slow-motion increases the adrenaline. I especially loved the effect where Smecker is inserted into the action when he's explaining how the latest kill went down.The acting is solid. Flannery and Reedus are very credible as brothers. They have a good camaraderie, and they also have a penchant for playing jokes on their friend, ""Funny Man"" Rocco (David Della Rocco). Rocco is good as their mob flunky friend who joins them. Willem Dafoe is clearly enjoying himself in an off-the-wall performance as the gay Smecker, and he's always fun to watch. The real surprise is Billy Connolly, however. Connolly is known as an adept comedian, but he's actually creepy as the notorious mob killer, Il Duce.""The Boondock Saints"" had a troubled production history, and most of that had to do with writer/director Troy Duffy. Miramax loved the script so much that they assigned Duffy to direct it, and they signed a record deal with Duffy's band. But Duffy's ego got in the way, and production halted. By the time filming got underway, the budget was cut in half, and the release was heavily restricted due to the Columbine tragedy. However, based on word of mouth, the film became a cult classic.Whatever faults Duffy may have personally, the film looks great, and is a lot of fun to watch. Influences from Tarantino (non-linear storytelling) and Scorcese (Boston setting, Catholicism) are evident, but this film appeals more to our basic instincts than our minds.Call it the ultimate guilty pleasure if you must, but I have no guilt about loving this movie.My rating: Rated R for Strong Bloody Violence and Pervasive Language",The Boondock Saints

The movie was pretty good but it wasn't amazing as people said it was and for a film to be slightly below 2 hours, it went way to fast with all the silly little action going on and it kept me away from really falling for the characters.

The violence is gritty and dirty, the language is filled with ""f""-words left and right. Standard post-Pulp Fiction fare in other words. What makes this stand out is not only it's well-made action scenes but also it's very ambiguous view on morality. The opinion that you are allowed to kill anyone you want to as long as you only kill bad people. A simplified view shared no doubt by many people sitting too much in front of their TV:s. I won't elaborate on this, but it is something that could (and should) disturb a lot of people. And it's also an interesting question to think about, whether the goals justify the means so to speak.In the end this is a movie that runs a tight line between stylish and tasteless.

79,artpf,Horrible,1,12 November 2013,"Two Irish brothers accidentally killed mafia thugs. They turned themselves in and were released as heroes. They then see it as a calling by God and started knocking off mafia gang members one by one. Willem Dafoe plays the detective trying to figure out the killings, but the closer he was to catching the Irish brothers, the more he thinks the brothers are doing the right thing. Surprised?This movie is genuinely horrible. It's directed like a cartoon and I am convinced the only reason it's gotten some good reviews is because Dafoe plays a gay cop and some people like to push the agenda. If you review the film on it's merits, it's silly and poorly acted and horribly directed. The entire film is like one big joke without the punch line.",The Boondock Saints
80,Bogey Man,Could have been a masterpiece in the hands of Abel Ferrara,7,1 July 2002,"Troy Duffy directed and wrote this debut of his which stars Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as two brothers, who literally think they're on a mission from God and act like saints that commit His will. That means they get rid of (=kill) all they consider bad, evil and rotten. This includes, of course pimps, rapists mafiosos and other more or less dangerous criminals. They get an FBI agent played by Willem Dafoe on their tail, but Dafoe is not necessarily their enemy in the crime infested world the film is set it. This sounds pretty promising story and probably the film could've been a masterpiece in the hands of Ferrara and his screenwriter Nicholas St. John. But still, The Boondock Saints is viewable and has its moments and merits.The subject matter of evil and someone's right to get rid of it and kill others has rarely been this underlined presented as it is in here. The theme of course makes me think that why not; they kill only people that probably could kill innocent people and never stop their criminal activities, unless our Saints don't stop it. But I still think, no one has right to kill or be the judge in these kinds of things, and the film doesn't really explain the motivations of our Saints as they are highly religious and by believing in God they know that Bible says Don't kill. The thought about God having sent his Saints on Earth is of course fascinating, but I would have liked the film even more philosophical and deep. Now it is pretty much a skeleton waiting for some flesh to cover its bones.The brothers are not evil as the people they kill, and they don't harm any innocent people. But then, I don't recall any explanations why they had to kill some non criminals in the peep show scene..? The film has couple of this kind of holes and unexplained acts, and they tone the film down. It seems like killing becomes a way for having good time for Rocco, who joins the ""angels"" as he is their friend. I think the director is pretty religious and has thought much about these things, because otherwise he wouldn't have included these religious elements in his film and he probably would've done totally pointless gun fight filled actioner!The photography in the film is very smooth and as great as the editing. The director knows many inventive camera styles and uses also flashbacks. I don't want to blame this film too much of copying Tarantino, but it is obvious Duffy has seen Tarantino's films and has had influence from them, I think. But still the stylish elements of the film seem fresh and inventive, and I really liked to see them in this film. The action scenes are very balletic (perhaps he has seen some Hong Kong movies, too!) and slow motion is used all the time there is action going on. This film looks great and proves the talent of the director.The dialogue, however, tries to be little too ""cool"" and it is easy to say it is Tarantino like, and I didn't like it all the time. The characters are sometimes too shallow and all they do is swear and scream and kill. Also, there are couple of usual cliches and bits that really annoyed me as they are so unoriginal and stupid, but fortunately they are not too plenty in this film.The shootouts which are very plenty are incredibly violent and bloody and come honestly close to the most violent actioners of the Orient. Well, not as nihilistic as A Day Without Policeman (hardly any film beats that!) but I mean films like John Woo and Ringo Lam. The bullet hits and wounds are so over the top and gratuitously gory and detailed it is not a wonder that the film had to be cut to get the R rating. I have the uncut unrated version and this was the second time I viewed the film. All the violent gun fight scenes are slow motion and the gory mayhem is pretty amazing, and couple of those scenes of ""detailed bullet hits"" (mostly those that were cut from the R version) are, in my opinion, too strong for this kind of film that is supposed to be fully serious and have some kind of moral. Perhaps the director became too enthusiastic when he started to play with fake blood with the effects crew! The director most likely wanted to do a film that reminds of these Hong Kong films and occasionally he succeeds. But still, it is hard to believe the Saints are committing only good things because the carnage they create is so vile and brutal.After all, I found some positive points in this film and due to them, I give this 7 out of 10, but this would have been a definite masterpiece if they had wanted to do it more serious and believable piece of work. If you like action films and films that have even little message and content, then watch this, but don't watch it with people that don't like violent movies because this is too much for them.",The Boondock Saints
81,mwilson1976,A rags to riches indie thriller with a quirky cast,7,21 January 2020,"Feeling that they are doing God's will, two Catholic brothers from Boston (played by Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) become vigilantes after killing two members of the Russian Mafia in self defence. Director Troy Duffy creates an unapologetically bloody, brutal and bizarre action film that has became a cult favourite due to its quirky cast and Tarantino style ultraviolence. The brothers massacre a bunch of unsuspecting Mafioso in a scene of absurd violence, and let more blood in a mass killing of porn-shop customers, they are then dubbed ""saints"" by the Boston Herald. Willem Dafoe is great as the brilliant, tortured, and gay FBI agent Paul Smecker, who listens to opera music on his discman whilst looking for clues at crime scenes. Scottish comedian Billy Connolly plays a convicted murderer turned two-fisted gunman, who memorably engages in a screaming, slow-motion fire-fight where Dafoe stands in the foreground, manically conducting an invisible choir. In a part especially written for him, David Della Rocco is Rocco a constantly panicked mob errand boy turned vigilante sidekick. Look out too for porn legend Ron Jeremy in a small role as a mafia sidekick. Duffy based the story for The Boondock Saints on things he saw when he was working as a bartender in Los Angeles, including watching a drug dealer steal money from a dead body. The movie was panned by critics on its release, and the amount of violence in the script saw it denounced by the Catholic Church too. Duffy allegedly received a letter from the Archdiocese of Toronto that called him the ""spawn of Satan."" Making little money during its very brief theatrical release, the movie managed to pull in $260 million in worldwide thanks to word of mouth and DVD sales, cementing the film's reputation as a cult classic.",The Boondock Saints

Extremely violent and somewhat dumb, the Boondock Saints don't push any boundaries that Pulp Fiction hasn't done, but aspires to do so. It fails, but is nevertheless entertaining.And it is WEIRD. Despite the fact that the FBI agent is WAY too strange to have ever passed the psyche profile to become and agent, he is funny and chilling. It's hard to say if he's a bad guy or a good guy. But listening to opera while doing an investigation feels kind of unnecessary and silly.",The Boondock Saints
83,ericrnolan,"A short review of ""The Boondock Saints"" (1999)",8,15 January 2017,"I can't say I fully understand the zeal of ""The Boondock Saints'"" (1999) cult following, but I had fun with it — I'd give it an 8 out of 10 for being unusual and unexpectedly diverting.I don't really see it as a crime thriller — it's more like an absurdly violent situation-comedy. It borrows its tone and style from 1994's ""Pulp Fiction,"" not to mention its own shock-comedy throwaway scene involving an accidentally discharged sidearm.Like its superior inspiration, its formula is creating quirky, likable characters with some funny dialogue, and then raising the tension by placing them in the midst of graphic violence. It mostly succeeds — Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus' characters are endearing, cool and easy to root for. I laughed out loud a few times, and I can see how their telegenic antiheroes would attract a devoted fandom.The directing seemed choppy and even amateurish. I noticed this right from the opening credits, which are awkwardly spliced with the on screen introduction of the main characters.The screen writing is a little spotty, too — we're never told, for example, how its two protagonists come to be such proficient assassins. (Are they former military? Is there a joke here I'm missing about them being ""blessed,"" consistent with the ""saints"" motif and all the references to Catholicism?) Nor do we get much meaningful information about their motivations. (Their bloody crusade begins only when they kill several gangsters in self- defense, then they seem to pursue a life of vigilantism as an afterthought.) Finally, our antiheroes seem refreshingly real and identifiable, while other characters (Willem Dafoe's detective and Billy Connolly's mafia hit-man) seem cartoonish enough to populate a farce like ""The Naked Gun"" series).Again, though — this was fun. I'd recommend it.",The Boondock Saints
84,thomasjay-2201,Brilliant Gem of a film,8,27 January 2019,"Finally got round to watching this and was not dissapointed in the slightest. A bonefied cult classic of a film there's so much on offer here be that the cast which comprised of: Sean Patrick Flanery, Willem Dafoe, Billy Connolly or the now ""A lister"" Norman Reedus of Walking Dead fame, or even the fantastically stylish and well executed plot of the film it's highly enjoyable. Fitting of many of the films released around the turn of the millennium it possesses that flair and charm which the dawn of 2000 bought with it see for example Snatch which has a fairly similar 'look' to this film and certainly a common charm. The story is full of laughs, highs and lows, dramatic and fantastic action and a surprisingly decent twist which personally upon first viewing wasn't obvious so in all this is a hidden gem of a film that's certainly worth your time.

91,Aly200,Actually quite entertaining and worthy of its cult status,7,6 February 2017,"While ""The Boondock Saints"" may have been the only successful film by Troy Duffy, this action romp has more than earned its cult classic status. The premise is simple, yet wildly entertaining: two Irish-American brothers are 'given' the task to eliminate the local Russian mob after a bar fight turned into a personal vendetta. The only person who might be able to stop them is a determined FBI agent who is almost always one step ahead in calculating the brothers' next move. As the McManus brothers, actors Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus (now famous as Darryl on ""The Walking Dead"") set each other apart perfectly. The actors are complete polar opposites in many fields: Flannery is the cockier and more brazen brother while Reedus plays more like a jokester, but equally deadly and serious as his counterpart. You might believe that both could really be brothers off-screen based on how well they play off each other throughout the film. The banter between the brothers is equal parts funny and also explanatory for why they do what they are doing according to their own logic. Playing the FBI agent on Flannery and Reedus' trail is a completely off-the-wall (though serious when called upon) Willem Dafoe. Probably the veteran actor's most comedic performance (intentionally as opposed to ""Speed 2""'s cheese factor), almost every line that Dafoe utters in the first act is sharp and hysterical. Given how effeminate Dafoe behaves throughout the majority of the run-time, it is hard to take the man seriously as he plays the ""gay character"" on the down-low but with a touch of over-the-top (wonder if Val Kilmer took some notes from Dafoe's work here to play ""Gay Perry"" in 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'?); it's clearly evident that Dafoe is relishing the role. His Agent Schmecker particularly delights in the routine degradation of the intelligence of one Boston PD officer, Detective Greenly, for the character's complete lack of observance and boneheaded responses to Schmecker's questions; some of Dafoe's finest biting dialogue comes from these interactions. All in all, a hilariously fun performance that will tickle the funny-bone. The music for the film is very in tune with the Irish heritage to a traditional punk band feel for a scene involving David Della Rocco shooting up cafe patrons due to paranoia. The soundtrack is perfect for the Boston setting and ethnicity of the two main characters. Cinematography is simple, dealing primarily in some close-ups and a few wide shots in order to catch everything possible. Give this a view and I think it'll become a go-to for some fun.",The Boondock Saints
92,asifahsankhan,Thou shalt not kill. It's the one commandment they cannot keep. (Because you don't a get a cult classic otherwise!),8,16 March 2017,"Amen.Some dude made me watch this on my freshman year of college because it ""was like the best movie ever oh my god you haven't seen it?"" kind of thing. I'm pretty sure it's only popular for dudes aged 15-22 who want another film where some other awesome dudes shoot the less awesome dudes regardless of plot. Like Pulp Fiction was over their heads or something...At least Willem Dafoe gets a hard-earned dollar every time some misfit 16-year-old buys this kick-ass-awesome DVD. His insanity deserves it.""Boondock Saints"" cost around $6 million, grossed $30,471 in two weeks in five theatres and was met with poor critical reviews; Then a miracle occurred - the film ultimately grossed about $50 million in domestic video sales and developed a large cult following. It became such a big hit on DVD -- so big, that a terrible sequel was on it's way for sure, to ruin the legacy for good. Justified. The film was released around the same time as the Columbine High School massacre, so its release was limited to a few theatres. However, it was so popular that once it came out in Blockbuster it spread rapidly via word of mouth.Along with the great cinematography, it has extensive special effects which you won't notice and good actors which you won't miss noticing: Willem Dafoe, Sean Patrick Flanery, Norman Reedus and an unrecognisable ""Funny Man"" David Della Rocco.Basically, the ""Boondock Saints"" refers to two Irish brothers (although I think sometimes in the movie they're referred to as cousins?) in Boston who get in a bar fight with a Russian mob guy and then the Russian mob guy comes to kill them but instead they end up killing him, and from that moment on they realise that they are going to be professional vigilante justice killers who exclusively kill bad guys and make the world a better place. Meanwhile, Willem Dafoe is a gay FBI agent who is chasing them, but then eventually he gets drunk and decides that he likes what they are doing. At the end of the movie, an Italian mob boss hires a senior citizen to kill the Boondock Saints, but he hears them praying in a basement and decides instead that he wants to join the Boondock Saints in their quest for vigilante justice, so now there are three Boondock Saints, and then Willem Dafoe lets them into a courtroom with all of their guns and they execute a man in front of everyone to let the world know that they are the Boondock Saints and they are here to kill. Normally my write ups of the Worst Movie plots are kind of silly but this one is actually pretty straight forward. The movie made about as much sense as this paragraph.There's a lot of pious Roman Catholic iconography, though no one except the beloved executed priest ever goes into a church for purposes other than being murdered. The lads are loyal to the church in the same way their fans are loyal to Da Bears. They aren't players themselves, but it's their team and don't mess with it. They do hold a quasi- religious ceremony, standing in a circle with a pal and vowing to never, ever, stop smoking or drinking or attend an AA meeting. There are many movies considered box office flops or are critically penned at first that have ended up becoming some of the most favourite cult classics and revolutionary films of all time, such as Clerks, or Donnie Darko but The Boondock Saints was a film to catch not only my interest, but the interest of many passionate fans after its initially lukewarm release. Not everybody enjoyed this film, in fact, the Archdiocese of Toronto contacted the director and called him the ""spawn of Satan,"" as well as claiming that his script was the work of the devil. I agree that the film isn't perfect, but it certainly isn't that bad!There are a lot of things that make this movie terribly good, but first and foremost we have to focus on Willem Dafoe (why the so- very- little recognition for his awesome performance?). If the terribleness of this movie is a ship, Willem Dafoe is the drunk captain. If the terribleness of this movie is a song, Willem Dafoe is the off-key chorus. If the terribleness of this movie is an OK, you get the point. Cramazing. I'm pretty sure Nicolas Cage watched this every morning before hitting the Wicker Man set and was like ""walking in the shadows of giants, Nic, walking in the shadows of giants."" The Netflix sleeve for this movie describes Willem Dafoe's character as ""openly gay,"" but that's not quite accurate. I think ""a ridiculous gay stereotype that isn't even a stereotype but is just weird and not how anyone acts ever anywhere"" would be a more appropriate description. Or also ""openly huh?"" To be fair, some of the movie's flaws were simply the magical combination that occurs when you mix high ambitions with low budgets. Things can quickly get out of hand. Suddenly your movie set is all like this. But that still doesn't explain the general lack of any kind of thoughtful decision making. For example, the low-end part of the whole movie (minus everything about Willem Dafoe) is the part where they scope out a strip club/peep show IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.The writer and director of The Boondock Saints, Troy Duffy, claims that the movie is based on his own experiences in Los Angeles. OK! If I had to guess based on the movie he'd made, I'd think he had a bunch of experiences involving Russian and Italian caricatures with horrible fake accents who couldn't act their way out of a Xenophobic stereotype.",The Boondock Saints
93,torstensonjohn,Surprisingly Cathartic,8,25 June 2018,"Many questions come into play when viewing a film, especially when it deals with religion in a way. Irish, true Catholics and devout to their beliefs. The film is about two Irish Catholic brothers from Boston (played by Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery) who mistakenly and accidentally kill two Russian mob men after a bar fight. Being honorable men, they turn themselves in only to be deemed heroes by the police force. 
Willem Dafoe is the prideful FBI agent tasked to bring them in but believes these men a re necessary evils on the fight against crime. A wild ride filled with violence, action, extreme cursing, humor and driven by the character development of the two brothers. 
Added bonus is having Billy Connelly in the film with a few surprise twists. The film is fast-paced, well written and performances are excellent. You will not be disappointed by the film at all, a solid 8/10",The Boondock Saints
94,Mr_Censored,"""Liberating, isn't it?""",8,7 May 2010,"There's a whopping back-story to ""The Boondock Saints,"" one which finds its writer/director, Troy Duffy, becoming an outcast in Hollywood, blowing his potential and alienating just about anyone and everyone who cares about him. Knowing this can be a bit distracting when you watch the film, as you can't help but wonder how differently the film could have turned out had it not been met with so much friction and abuse. Case in point: when Miramax dropped the film in the late 90's, Duffy was forced to make the film with another studio with half of the originally poposed budget. Ouch.Like any director worth his salt, though, Duffy pressed on and in the face of his own self-imposed adversity, crafted a film that has been widely regarded as a cult classic. Starring Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus, ""The Boondock Saints"" tells the wild tale of two Irish brothers who, after a message from a higher power, go on a killing spree, gunning down the criminals who pollute their home-town of Boston. They are met with a mixed reaction of glee and outrage from their fellow citizens as well as a flamboyant FBI special agent hot on their trail, played by the great Willem Dafoe, who steals damn near each and every scene he is in.While the film certainly has a few flaws (mostly dealing with bad pacing issues) the end result is quite a visceral and cathartic experience. The film has a unique take on vigilante justice (Duffy came up with the idea for the film after witnessing a drug-dealer steal money from a corpse) and much like the closing credits which depict the various reactions the Saints are met with by the public, will likely polarize its audience. There's a wealth of ultra-violence and cool shootout scenes are sprinkled throughout, but merely taking its surface appeal away is to do the film a great injustice. In a way, ""The Boondock Saints"" allows you to live vicariously through its characters, who are only acting in a way that many of us have only dreamed about on our worst day. In the end, it might not accomplish its lofty goals with the greatest of ease, but at the very least, takes entertainment to a whole new level.",The Boondock Saints
95,j-lacerra,Boondock Ain'ts,1,31 August 2010,"Having read many reviews of the Boondock Saints, I was expecting a well done rip-off of Pulp Fiction. Well, this movie is not fit to be a B-movie second feature to Pulp Fiction in a two-dollar fourth run single screen movie shack. It is really, really bad. Willem Dafoe's gay genius FBI man is so over the top as to be completely unbelievable and unacceptably silly.But the movie itself is also poorly done. The two non-descript and interchangeable Irish brothers are not the least bit compelling. But their first (technically second) hit made me give up. Guess what, folks. Elevator shafts do not have louvered vents that lead directly into the ventilation ductwork. Ventilation ductwork is never pristinely clean inside and is never without screw heads and loads of internal devices (sensors, dampers, etc.). It is also almost never huge enough to accommodate two grown men to crawl side by side.Having lost my attention with its resort to such TV movie baloney, I could watch no more. By the halfway point, at which I turned it off, there had not been a single female character shown who might provide some relief in this festival of mindless testosterone.I can hang with lots of suspension of belief. But here I was shaken out by the poor story, script, hammy acting, bad accents, unfunny funny bits, and mistakes, such as: Genius FBI guy illustrates how two bullet entry wounds were caused by two guns fired at sharp angles; when we actually see the execution, the two guns are held almost parallel - no sharp angle! Enough of this crap. One to really avoid!",The Boondock Saints
96,Indyrod,"Extremely entertaining, violent, with a great sense of humor",9,25 September 2008,"I really enjoyed this ultra violent take on a sort of Tarantinoesque satirical plot and style about two fraternal twin Irish brothers, who due to there own circumstances, become vigilantes with a mission of ridding the Boston streets of all nasty evil, mostly mob, criminals. And trying to catch them, is a very gay FBI agent played brilliantly by Willem Defoe, who is hilarious. Yes, there are some very funny moments in this movie, but as a whole it is definitely not a comedy. Kind of like ""Natural Born Killers"", except it's the good guys killing the bad guys. The film definitely is conveying a message about society in general, and how the general public would be quite positive on what the brothers are pursuing. Even the cops after a point, are pretty much agreeing with them. The movie is very very graphically violent, which is always good, and some of the kill scenes are memorable. I understand director Troy Duffy had a hell of a time bringing the movie to the masses, but it is here, unrated with all the violence intact, and I had a lot of fun with it.

98,BigGuy,Great Movie! With an awesome opening sequence,9,23 November 2000,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  The gist is that two brothers become vigilantes after some Russian Mafia types cause problems in their Irish neighborhood.  The opening sequence is one of the best I have ever seen.  It sets the tone for the movie, and in a way describes everything the movie is about.The two brothers (played by Flannery and Reedus) give superb performances. The story hinges on them, and how they seem totally in sync with each other, and the world around them.  It is hard to believe they aren't really brothers, as they perform as if they were twins.The only real problem I had with the movie was Defoe's character.  Defoe plays an FBI investigator who is assigned to the murders committed by the brothers.  The problem, at least as I see it, is that the character has potential that is never realized.  For instance the character is supposed to be gay (well basically), but it doesn't add to the plot in any way.  And he seems to show up at times just to patch up the plot a little bit.  If that character was used better I would give Boondock Saints 10, but instead only a 9, but an don't miss this movie 9.",The Boondock Saints
99,Slarkshark,Makes Me Wish I Was Irish,10,30 December 2020,"I first watched this years ago based on reputation, and of course on St. Patrick's Day; I was not disappointed in the slightest. Well deserving of its cult favourite status. The MacManus brothers are irresistibly likable, it's no wonder why Agent Smecker has a soft spot for them. The brothers absolutely live in the moment and for each other. They wear their hearts on their sleeves and may seem like they would be brash, but in actuality they are very intelligent and calculated.Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery were perfect playing the brothers, and David Della Rocco was hilarious as... well Rocco. However, it's William Dafoe who takes the cake. Dafoe delivered an outstanding performance and should have won some kind of an award to say the least.The movie almost has an unpolished feel to it which makes me enjoy it even more. It wasn't hyped when it came out, and actually came out of nowhere, at least for me. It's easy to compare to a Ritchie or Tarantino film as there are similarities, but it honestly has a different feel and I would not have thought it was directed by either one of them while watching it.It asks some big sociology questions too, which I'm sure many people would be torn on, as shown during the credits. Is vigilantism right if it makes the world a better place? The MacManus brothers certainly believe so.That poor cat though, what was its name again?",The Boondock Saints
100,PCT1970,Sometimes Over The Top Works And Sometimes It Doesn't,5,23 May 2019,"This is Duffy's first feature film and it is obvious. The film is all around overrated. The film has fair direction, screenplay, cinematography and acting. The actors do their best, which isn't very good, in this over the top film. Defoe is especially disappointing as he tries to overcompensate for the shoddy script or perhaps he was just off his game. I can just say it is not the Defoe this viewer has grown to appreciate. The plot revolves around twin brothers who set out to rid South Boston of inept mobsters through their own brand of justice and their faith. On the vigilantes trail is an eccentric, offbeat and weird detective. He is accompanied by a bumbling police force. The twins become local heroes to many especially those practicing faith. The plot is flawed, outrageous, unrealistic, unintelligent and silly. I can only try to guess that the film was attempting to scrutinize whether vengeance in the form of violence is acceptable in a faith based community. That is if there was any message Duffy was trying to convey to begin with. Sometimes over the top films work for entertainment purposes and sometimes they don't.

101,BHorrorWriter,Dark Comedy Done Right!,9,10 September 2001,"This intelligent, crafty, dark comedy is a breath of fresh air.  Though not completely original, this movie really works.  The story centers around 2 Irish brothers (fraternal twins), who wake up while spending the night in a prison cell, and are ""chosen"" to take out God's vengeance on bad guys.What develops is an excellent dark comedy/drama that explodes from the first frame till the last.  Quick, fast paced camera work and excellent photography helps to move the story along. The action is non-stop and the dialogue, though very ""offensive"" (alot of the ""f"" word), is right on target for the setting and mood of the movie.The showdown at the end is a little less intense then the rest of the movie, but still, nonetheless, works!The relationship between the two brothers is right on.  Flannery and Remmus really do act like 2 brothers (the fighting in the air shaft, hilarious).One of the main highlights of the movie is the performance given by Willem Dafoe.  Diverse, witty, and totally hilarious.  He delivers and excellent performance as the FBI agent.  He is intelligent, comical, gay, and doesn't want to admit it right off the top, but agrees with what the brothers are doing.  He had me laughing throuh the film...and seeing him in Drag...Oh, you just gotta see this movie.Though some plot points weren't totally developed, (what happened to ""F**k Ass?), this movie is still an excellent example of a lower budget movie that really kicks ass, and offers a fast paced, action packed joy ride.Check this movie out...It is well worth the time.  I would like to get the DVD, and watch all the extra's that are on it.  I would also like to get my hands on an uncut version.9 out of 10",The Boondock Saints
102,arthurclay,An acting gem from Willem Dafoe,10,7 December 2005,"The brothers are pretty good in this but they are overshadowed by Dafoe who shines like a brand new penny. At first the viewer thinks he's gonna pull a Gary Oldman on your ass but surprisingly not his character is good in his motives (although certainly not normal). There is a lot of shooting in this film which I enjoyed and it was nothing if not entertaining. There is a trace of humor to be found here and there (mostly supplied by Willem Dafoe) and again his acting is the centerpiece of the film. Some fourth rate guy pretending to be a film critic once called Dafoe a ""scenery chewer"". Many words come to mind when I think of Dafoe (legend, great actor, multi-millionaire, Jesus) but that phrase doesn't. He is brilliant. Also features a fun cameo by Ron Jeremy as the Mob's Underboss.",The Boondock Saints
103,FKDZ,Interesting... and Willem Dafoe...!,7,10 June 2020,"Boondock Saints is a movie about some guys that are out to rid the world of ''bad guys''.The concept sounds fun, and its executed well in some aspect, mainly the editing and directing is really great, and the writing hard hitting. Especially in 2020 this movie is not for the faint of heart. That said, its used appropriately...mostly, might be a bit too generous with it use at certain times.What it didn't do well in was any sort of depth, both in their ideology and the characters themselves. The bad guys are just ''Bad guys'' basically and that's that, and the same goes for the good guys. Only Willem Dafoe's character has a decent amount of character depth in this movie. This lack of depth though meant to me that I couldn't really care for the characters in general. During stressful moments for them I wasn't stressed or worried something might happen. Everyone in this movie is certified crazy and very unrelatable, leading to little investment. There's some other things I could say, but the movie doesn't really care, so I won't either. (the whole II Duce thing)That leads me to the other point that this movie is just bats*** insane. The writing definitely is fun, and it's really enjoyable what the director pulls off. My only pet peeve is why they decided to silence the gunshot sounds during certain slow motion scenes in place for just music. It really felt like there was an essential sound missing and made the scenes feel awkward.Music is very... interesting as well, it goes from up beat 90s techno to Opera. And that's fine, and when they use Opera/Classical music it usually works, but the upbeat techno section really gave it a schlocky vibe. Not a fan.Now all we need here is just a section about Willem Dafoe, such a good AND just crazy performance (thanks to the writing). There are some scenes that are just fantastic and I won't say more.The movie at the end tries to create a conversation in your head about if it's morally right to just ''kill bad guys''. I feel like this should've been expanded upon much earlier, not the last minute of the movie. It doesn't explore it any further and without that extra depth there not much of a conversation to be had (like: can no human make a mistake without deathly punishment? Do ''bad' humans not deserve redemption or forgiveness?).I'd give it a 7+/10. You certainly won't waste your time on it, but at the end of the day (even if they try to be a bit philosophical at the end) it is mainly and action movie with some standout directing and at times writing.",The Boondock Saints
104,deadbull-95171,Unique surreal super entertaining crime drama.,9,30 May 2021,"Willem Dafoe is a brilliant actor, and he stands out in any role, which he does again here as the fabulously eccentric FBI agent that is highly sympathetic to the motives of his quarry.And those motives are a theistic vigilantism, but still sane, though quite implausible. I would give up looking for anything too resemblant of real behaviors of law enforcement or criminal activity, especially in the 2 protagonists, who combine the best and worst of human impulses, with everything in between.For all the elements thrown into this surreal stew, it is served up straight and is easy to follow. Nothing to interpret or figure out. It is really quite bizarre and the physics of human behavior would never allow this to be called a 'true crime' situation, but why do we look at movies?It's sure better then worrying about health or money issues for awhile,
and this is an extremely entertaining, witty, strange, comical, violent movie with flashes of brilliance from its main star all the time.Dafoe is working with some great younger talent here and the strangeness might remind you of the Crying Game, not in terms of plot or sexuality, but just in terms of being asked to take as acceptable givens, things that are moving past the fringe.This is some sort of great movie as an entertainment.

Smecker is a great detective, although his methods are a bit strange. When we first see him he is well-dressed in a 4 button suit and flowing hair. He examines the crime scene wearing latex gloves he retrieves from a pouch on his belt after inserting the earplugs to his Walkman CD so he can listen to opera while he carefully surveys the evidence. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are excellent as a couple of meat packers who play jokes on one another and their co-workers, are well liked and respected, and obviously frugal Catholic boys who work and play hard. They live in a loft in a commercial building in the Irish neighborhood where they live a Spartan life, mattresses on the floor and not a television in sight. The characters merge seamlessly to form a very basic and primitive plot, one that gets under your skin, but there are some moments when you have to wonder what exactly is going on. Not a film for the little ones, or anyone who has a weak stomach when it comes to blood, especially if you rent the Unrated Version. Unless you are into extreme violence for the sake of violence, not a collectible, but worth seeing if you are a fan of vigilante justice.",The Boondock Saints
107,Der_Schnibbler,Derivative trash,1,15 August 2006,"Two Irish brothers decide to cleanse the city with a bit of good old vigilante justice.Everything about this film is so generic as to be embarrassing. The cops are utter fools, the main guy on the case is some homosexual FBI agent who listens to opera on headphones while investigating crime scenes (he closes his eyes to ""take in"" the music), and our two heroes recite Bible verses before shooting someone execution style. If you think that last one is dramatic, don't. They sound more like two buffoons than any kind of divine force of justice. In fact, they are the most irritating duo of good-hearted criminals since Bud Spencer and Terence Hill. They also speak over four languages, because they ""paid attention in school."" If you're looking for a serious film dealing with villains turning to unwitting heroes, watch ""Pulp Fiction,"" which this film amply ""references"" quite often. (In one scene a character ""accidentally"" shoots a cat -- cue exclamations of surprise by teenage audience.) Otherwise, skip this ridiculous film and ignore the praise given it. Only testosterone-charged fifteen-year-olds and grown men whose emotional development corresponds to one would ever be impressed by this tripe.",The Boondock Saints
108,TheRadiobox,"Oh, those Irishmen",6,18 June 2020,"The Boondock Saints was directed and written by Troy Duffy and stars Sean Patrick Flanery, Norman Reedus, Willem Dafoe, David Della Rocco, and Carlo Rota. It's about two Irish Catholic brothers who commit vigilante justice by wiping out the criminal underground of Boston in the name of God.The plot: Duffy's story is a decently interesting non-linear series of killings and investigations. There are plenty of flashbacks which are engaging and work in moderation, but are indulged on to the point of becoming repetitive. While it is interesting to see how events played out after being deduced by Dafoe's character, in my opinion it may have served the film well to switch it up from time to time to keep things as stylistic as Duffy intends while also adding a bit more variety to the proceedings.The characters: Characterization is excellent in The Boondock Saints, with the three leads being played with appropriate panache by Flanery, Reedus, and Dafoe. All characters feel fully realized with interesting quirks, backstories, motivations, and dialogue exchanges. The chemistry between Flanery and Reedus is almost palpable, Connor and Murphy feeling like brothers who love each other most of the time and get frustrated with each other on occasion. Supporting cast members such as David Della Rocco, Carlo Rota, and Bob Marley (no not that one) are all entertaining and just as nuts as the others.While the Boondock Saints does have quite the personality some of the stylistic choices bring the film a little too over-the-top; namely the soundtrack. The music incorporated into the film's running time is good, no doubt, however it is a major distractor from the sights and sounds of the mostly well filmed action set pieces. Aside from the abrasive soundtrack, there is a mention of the MacManus brothers reputation a couple of times throughout the movie, but it's only used to quickly make a contrivance for Smecker's investigation.The technics: Technical aspects are surprisingly good for a movie with as low of a budget as this. Camera work, lighting, and effects are all great and showcase the talents of the team that put this film together. The only technical complaint I have has to do with the editing, although it is clearly a stylistic decision, the frequent cuts to black and intercutting of music where it doesn't fit does become annoying by the end of the running time.Altogether, The Boondock Saints is a satisfying and glossy picture that puts its personality at the forefront of the screen. While it does sometimes lean into indulgence and maybe one too many references, it's never boring. With solid casting and characters, it's hard to deny the fun you'll have while watching; and while there are a bunch of aspects that take away from the movie, I never once regretted my time watching it.69/100",The Boondock Saints

110,chvylvr80,An interesting film that isn't conventional. SPOILER ALERT!,7,19 September 2003,"The Boondock Saints isn't really a wannabe Tarantino film like some people say. There are some similarities between Tarantino's films and this movie. Clever dialogue, lots of gunplay, and a tale of people outside the law. Willem Dafoe does stellar work in this film. The part when he makes out with the mob heavy is above and beyond the call of duty. A gay FBI agent is not a character that you see often. Personally I think that the brothers could have been played with more menace and less of an Irish good old boy style. The film lays on the avenging angel thing a little thick. The style of the film wears a little thin after repeated viewings, but it's a pleasant experience to see a quality B-movie like this. Billy Connolly is great as the ultimate assassin by the way. Bottom Line: This movie is better than it deserves to be, you should check it out.",The Boondock Saints
111,chelano,Accents and guns have never been so cool,8,18 January 2011,"There is something about combining dirty accents and guns that can make anyone cool. The ending and a couple scenes could of been a little more eventful, but other than that, it was a great movie. The brothers or ""the Saints"" were played by Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus. These two were just the meaning of cool. There were some side characters also who really knew how to to act. One in general is Willem Dafoe. He really took control of his character. Now Billy Connolly was in it shortly too and he was also pretty good even though he did get a big speaking part. The movie combines killing with the Lord. The only people the Saints are killing though are bad Mafia type guys. Once they are done, they say a prayer in their native language and put pennies on their eyes laying them to rest. Like a good guy, bad guy feel. The way the movie was filmed was fantastic. They would show the dead bodies killed by the Saints, then Willem Dafoe would say, ""this is how it happened"" leading into a flashback showing everything. The movie added some humor also because of the way people got killed. Nothing started right for the Saints, but in the end they did end up killing the guys they needed. The weak minded towards bad language would not enjoy the film because it has some pretty crude dialog, but it does fit well with the film if you know the culture. Overall, this film almost makes you want a gun for the Boondock Saints makes it look so easy to use one. But probably wouldn't be a good thing.",The Boondock Saints

Based on what he said, I thought it sounded pretty good. A movie about two brothers who become local heroes by defending their town against mobsters can't be all bad, right?WRONG. This is the WORST MOVIE EVER. I don't know why there are so many positive comments about it. Honestly, how could this many people watch it and not realize how stupid it is? I suspect some people have been paid to write this stuff.First of all, the director apparently has no idea what type of movie he's making. Is it an action flick? A drama? A comedy? Who knows!? You could turn this into a game of Guess the Genre: every time it feels like it's settling down into a certain mood, try to guess which completely different mood it will swing into next! Hint : you can tell a genre switch is coming up whenever the soundtrack switches from traditional Irish folk music to electric guitar.Add some incredibly bad acting, Willem DaFoe as an unrealistically gay FBI agent (or an ""unorthodox"" agent as the back cover puts it), blatant Quentin Tarantino rip-offs, and a stupid plot about a couple of dorks who kill in the name of God, and you have got yourself one seriously bad movie.

114,dtb,"Kickin' Crime Comedy-Drama, Contrite Commentary Make DVD Well Worth Watching",8,21 March 2006,"After watching the riveting documentary OVERNIGHT, I just had to rent THE BOONDOCK SAINTS to see what all the fuss was about. Troy Duffy's writing and directing style sports enough freshness, snappy dialogue, and inventive violence that it's easy to see why an impressed Harvey Weinstein called the script ""PULP FICTION with soul."" I was entertained enough by this stylized black comedy-thriller to bear with its nigh-comical overuse of the F-word (intentionally so in one funny scene which, as one of our heroes puts it, ""certainly illustrates the diversity of the word"") and somewhat heavy-handed stereotypes, like Willem Dafoe as openly gay FBI agent Paul Smecker, swaying to Italian opera music on his portable CD while checking out a crime scene. To be fair, that bit and a humorous scene with Smecker in bed with a cuddle-happy partner are the only blatant references to his sexual orientation; the rest of the film focuses on Smecker's skill as an FBI agent, not his sex life. Dafoe is clearly having a blast as the title characters' tough, clever nemesis and reluctant admirer. Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery (Young Indiana Jones himself, all grown up!) are engaging as Connor and Murphy McManus, the ""Boondock Saints"" themselves. When these Irish Catholic brothers (aye, from Ye Olde Sod with brogues and all, though Reedus' Irish accent occasionally slips) clobber Russian mobsters who try to strong-arm the owner of the boys' favorite bar, their violent victory turns them into vigilantes and folk heroes in their South Boston neighborhood. The brothers truly care about each other and enjoy each other's company, which goes a long way towards making you root for them. Their knowledge of languages (""We paid attention in school...Our mother insisted on it."" There's a couple of nice Irish boys for you, obeying their mom! I should know, my mom's side of the family is Irish! :-) allows them to devise all kinds of ambushes for crime families from every corner of the globe. I liked Duffy's CSI-like approach of showing our heroes about to get the drop on their targets, then cutting to the crime scene as Smecker makes his deductions, then flashing back to the McManus brothers' actual attack showing whether or not Smecker's theory was correct. I especially liked the hit where the boys and their loose-cannon friend Rocco (David Della Rocco chews the scenery, but it's fun to watch him do it) confront Il Duce (our household's favorite Scotsman Billy Connolly as the Hannibal Lector of assassins...and maybe more...) in a middle-class residential neighborhood, where Smecker literally walks us through the crime scene right alongside our heroes; he's like Rod Serling, Detective. Despite the movie's turbulent history, these ...SAINTS provide high-flying, straight-shooting, tush-kicking entertainment for action fans. Duffy's commentary track on the DVD is interesting and entertaining, too, though part of its appeal for me was listening to Duffy's tone of voice: it's the tone of a man who knows he's been a jerk and is trying to atone for his sins. Duffy might as well be saying nothing but ""I'm sorry I was such a sh**head"" over and over. The arrogant, insulting Duffy of OVERNIGHT is nowhere to be heard (though he can be seen in a brief cameo in the bar as our heroes kick Russian ass) as he showers heartfelt praise on his cast and crew and talks ruefully (and without mentioning certain names :-) about the near-impossibility of getting this violent indie a theatrical release in the wake of Columbine, battles with the ratings board because of said violence, and making the film on a low budget (Miramax was going to provide Duffy with a $15 million budget, but he ended up with Franchise Pictures and a super-tight $6 million budget. One of the thorns in Duffy's side was wanting to use classic rock songs in the film and finding out he couldn't because the rights to each one cost millions of dollars). A while back, Duffy announced plans for a ...SAINTS sequel with Reedus, Flanery, and Connolly reprising their roles; it'll be interesting to see if he can get that off the ground. If he does, I'd be glad to check out the further adventures of South Boston's favorite working-class vigilantes.",The Boondock Saints

The story is told in a style that is reminiscent of ""Reservoir Dogs"" and inspirational to ""Memento"".  The visuals are stunning and the gunfights are choreographed extremely well.  Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus were magnificent as the MacManus twins.  What was even more surprising was the casting of Willem Dafoe as FBI Agent Paul Smecker and he probably had the best performance in the movie (It is really an eye-opener to see the man who played Savior of the World in a certain film from 1988 and come back eleven years later as a homosexual FBI agent!).

The writing is clever and witty and goes hand and hand with the rest of the movie. The brilliance is demonstrated from the comedic scenes which leads to blood baths, reminding me strongly of Quentin Tarantino's work.The movie showed four different points of view(The vigilantes, the police, the criminals, and the public) throughout the movie and was the first one I've seen to actually do this with success since Pulp Fiction. The movie did not make you take sides, but it showed you the reactions to every event. As the movie progresses, the audience sees what happens chronologically up to a certain point, then what the detective thought happened after the crime, and back to what actually happened where it left off. It makes the movie very exciting and keeps you entertained throughout the movie because you see the brilliance of the detective and wonder about the saints' fate as the movie moves closer to the climax.Dafoe's performance as Detective Paul Smecker is not only perfectly portrayed but also extremely whimsical. It sets forth a character that most would not expect from the type of action-drama as The Boondock Saints. His character is not only original, it is very obscure and complex. It brings forth questions about not only his personality but also his beliefs and ethics.In Conclusion, the movie is incredible and should be watched by anyone with intentions to be entertained or be enlightened.

120,liderc,The Worst Film Of All Time,1,25 October 2002,"I read an announcement for a public screening of this movie at my university and everybody I asked about this movie was full of praise. I think I just asked the wrong people about their opinion. This movie is one of the worst I've ever seen. Not only does it show incredibly disgusting violence and tons of blood, it tries to excuse it with a `black and white' fanatic religious point of view that there are just `bad' and `good' guys and if the `good' kill the `bad' it's right. No matter if they brutally murder a cat for example during that process. The script is absolutely amateurish and bad, so bad it will make you scream for your money and the time wasted on this atrocity back. There isn't a single sentence in this movie without excessive and dumb vulgarity and bad jokes. The directing and photography rank between `simply amateurish' and `so bad it's funny'. The only famous actor in this movie is Willem Dafoe, and I guess he's praying every night that nobody sees this movie. He plays a smart FBI agent who is same-gender attracted and (surprise, surprise) his character is thrown into nearly every gay stereotype possible. Not a surprise at all, from a movie as feeble-minded as this, can you expect something else? During that process Dafoe gives some ridiculous examples that imitating Tim Curry in the Rocky Horror Picture Show can a)go completely wrong and b)can go just more wrong when it's out of place and just to feed the stereotypes of a silly script obviously aimed on a certain audience, that, to my great sorrow, does seem to exist. My verdict: `The Worst Movie Of All Time' just seems to be right for this one. It's always frustrating to see that a movie like `Plan 9 From Outer Space', whose only failure is the lack of budget and that otherwise has a complex statement and very good directing  is labelled `The Worst Film Of All Time' and movies like `Boondock Saints' are not. Who is the guy whom we have to thank for this monstrosity?

Accuse me of being a square who just doesn't get it but for the love of god please read the review before you get overly sensitive and click no! I never heard anybody talking about this movie. I only saw it because a website where I usually go to look up recent movies kept promoting this garbage so I sat down and watched this rubbish out of curiosity(for free...what, you'd think Id' actually pay to see this?). There goes two hours of my life that I will never get back. I rushed to Amazon.com to see the reviews but much to my dismay it has a four and a half star average on Amazon. I went to IMDb.com and my jaw hit the floor. This movie is in the top 250! I had to get surgery to keep my jaw off the floor.All bad jokes aside this movie is so terrible that it defines bad. Its not even enjoyable in its badness like some movies can be. Its so terrible that it makes you give up hope on life. Yes its THAT bad. The whole movie is about two idiotic Irish brothers, Connor(Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy(Norman Reedus) that decide that they are ordained to kill evil men in South Boston. Thats the whole movie in a nutshell plus throw in a stupid plot twist involving the homicidal hit man trying to kill them being their father. Willem Dafoe must have been blackmailed to appear in this monstrosity of a film( as a homophobic homosexual FBI agent). I don't see any other reason an actor of his talent should appear in this so-called movie.The acting is dreadful. Norman Reedus played a decent bad guy in Dueces Wild but he sucks here. Sean Patrick Flanery is just as bad and David Della Rocco needs to be kept away from every movie studio with armed guards,tanks and rottweilers for safety reasons. He is just that awful. Willem Dafoe chews scenery like a locust. Now we all know that Willem Dafoe is up there with all the great actors like Denzel Washington, Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Edward Norton, Tim Roth, Morgan Freeman, Gene Hackman, Kevin Spacey, Harvey Keitel and the slew of others. We all know that Willem Dafoe even shines when he is in a movie that is a total train wreck(Think State Of The Union) but not here. in this movie he is reduced to a goofy FBI agent that re-enacts each crime scene while channeling Jim Carrey and Dame Edna in a performance that is so over the top that its eyebrow-raising for all the wrong reasons. The film is a total bore and its blatant attempt to rip off films of Quentin Tarantino, Luc Besson and Guy Ritchie come off as pitiful more than flattering.The acting and the action scenes are not the only things that suck. Nobody in this movie seems to speak a coherent language and most of the time are using cheesy action quips that nobody says. Not even in action flicks! They say this movie is style-over-substance. I agree that there is no substance but there is also no style either. Style wise this movie is like a guy wearing a plaid suit with a Buffalo Bills hat and Florsheim shoes. He'd like to think he was cool but he's not. This movie has achieved cult status. You have no idea how sad that makes me feel. Whatever happen to movies rightfully earning a cult fanbase. This movie gained fans off an obscene amount of hype and we all know its true.All of you reasonable people out there PLEASE tell people the truth about this movie(screw what your friends will think of you). Tell the people that this movie is incredibly bad so that they can save themselves the torture of having to sit through a movie that can only be enjoyed by people who sniff glue.

This has got to be one of the out and out dumbest films I've ever seen, if not ever made. Willem Dafoe prancing about to classical music, unbelievably stupid gunfights, horrible dialogue, Willem Dafoe cross-dressing. This is really a heap of garbage. And I love bad movies. In fact I like watching you're average B-movie trash more than the boring mainstream crap put out by the big studios. But, this movie is incredibly bad. If it was regarded as a ""so bad its good"" movie, I would praise it up and down. But, to watch it in the context of your friends telling you that it is a legitimate good film makes it one of the worst pieces of junk ever. I seriously can't believe that many of my own friends, who otherwise have good taste, consider this a good film. This is crap, and that's all it is.",The Boondock Saints
124,lopcar1993,"An overrated by the books action film, nothing new, nothing special",2,30 October 2009,"I've heard allot about this movie over the last few years people all over have been praising it as a mild stone in film making. Calling it a cult classic and one of the best action dramas ever put to film, well I'm sorry to say they were wrong. This movie was nothing like people advertised and boasted about, it was at times very hard to discern what was going on and who was killing who and what was really going on in the film.The Boondock Saints boast a cool and hip visual style that resonates with the best action films of the 80's and early 90's and some of John Woo's japan work before he moved to America. But even that can't save this film from being highly overrated and contrived. TBS was great on the action and humor(what little it had if there wasn't a curse word in it.)It tires so very hard to be convincing, powerful, emotional and most of all smart but it can't under the dumb down dialogue and the poor execution of the film. The mediocre script and direction of Troy Duffy who I've never heard and for good reasons. You see Duffy tries to create a movie where two brothers who are devoted to each other and devoted to helping the little people think there doing God's work by killing all theses mob boss and criminals where in reality there actually psycho killers just mopping up the scum in south Boston. I like the style of the film and I liked the way it played out, but if Duffy had just thought it out more and put a more dramatic and emotional effect into the film, then maybe, just maybe, this film would have made my top ten list sadly it makes my top ten list of the worst films of the 90's. But none the less it had the heart, it had the spirit and it had the strength to be great and groundbreaking bu sadly it falls short due to bad plotting, on par acting, a terrible script and bad action sequences that don't really dazzle you or blow your mind.Sean Patrick Flanery(Who I never hear of besides this movie.) Plays one of the Mac Manus brothers, he does pretty good here and does try hard to be convincing. But he fails under Duffy's bad script and poor direction and thus is kind of an eye sore with his bad Irish accent. Norman Reedus(Another actor I've never heard of outside this film.) Is areal downside in this with his bad acting he really brings down his character and makes it nothing more than a brainless thug who say a pray for the men they are about to kill. Billy Connolly(Who is alright for the few minutes he's actually in the movie.) is pretty good in this and is one of the higher class acts in the film, he brings some ruthless style and cunning to a very simple character and does well with his time on screen. Willem Dafoe(the saving grace in this film.) Is fantastic in it and is the only reason to see this film besides the slick, but highly under done, action sequences. He brings up the quality of this film and elevates it to from bad to alright. But again even he can't save this film from crumbling under it's own failure. But none the less the cast does there best with the material there given and tries there hardest to make this a great film, but sadly they can't.The Boondock Saints is dark,violent and sacrilegious, that pretty much sums up the main focal point of this film plot and story and it tells you all you need to know about the film in general. It boast a hip, cool and vibrant style of film making and that can't save it from be a by the book action film with not so special action sequences. All in all The Boondock Saints is passing entertainment bu nothing more.",The Boondock Saints
125,imxo,It's All Been Done Much Better Before,2,17 May 2008,"Boondock Saints is a movie with one or two original ideas and lots and lots of stolen ones. Ultimately, it's just a violent, pretentious, idiotic rip-off of a movie. Even the title of this movie is stupid. Whoever heard of one boondock?After viewing this movie I'm starting to understand why Italians are so incensed about the stereotypes of Italians in all those Mafia movies. In the same way, Boondock Saints will certainly not do much for the Boston Irish - or even for the Irish Irish.I thought the carpet chewing performance of David Della Rocco was the only good performance in the film. The other actors were just wallpaper, and Willem Dafoe was positively annoying. The writing, too, is extraordinarily bad. At one point Dafoe sends a cop out to buy him a ""latte with a twist of lemon."" Coffee with milk and lemon must be an acquired taste, which is exactly what would have to happen to be able to appreciate the tripe in this movie.",The Boondock Saints
126,fibreoptic,An engrossing vigilante movie.,9,20 August 2004,The Boondock Saints has a nice refreshing story with some real excellent acting even though at times Willem Dafoe at times goes too much over the top and the direction was quite clever. It's all about these two Irish guys who work in a meat packing factory who get sick and tired of the Russian mafia bullying the people in the Irish neighbourhood they live in so what starts out as a bar fight ends up with them killing two of the Russian mafia guys even though they were kind of pressured into it. So they decide to become vigilante's and kill evil doers and rope in the help of one of their crazed Italian American friends. Also in this is the gay FBI agent played by Willem Dafoe who is in charge of the investigation. He is really smart and is quite good (but not perfect) at deducing what had happened at each crime scene. He ends up having a moral dilemma though which ended up being good for the story. The Italian mafia end up hiring an insane bounty hunter played by Billy Connolly to track down and kill the Irish lads. It has a nice little twist near the end and is thoroughly entertaining. If you liked Snatch and Lock Stock then you should like this. 9/10,The Boondock Saints

The plot pulls you in, the characters are strange but extremely like-able and the violence is not only graphic but very creative. This movie is all kinds of awesome but the sequel sucks and the director hasn't made anything else worth watching. Thankfully the cast didn't suffer the same fate. The writer/director clearly threw together every good idea and element of a great movie that he had into this flick which makes it stand out but it seems that he only had enough good content for one movie",The Boondock Saints

But anyway...Connor and Sean Mcmanus are fraternal Irish brothers who have an epiphany happen to them which convinces them to go on a mission from God to stop criminals living in their town. They are joined by David Della Rocco who plays himself as Rocco. They are being chased by a FBI agent named Paul Smecker.Now while this movie won't win any big rewards, it does have many positive points. The cast is great with Sean and Norman having great chemistry with each other. Willem Dafoe plays Paul Smecker and is great in his role.I just couldn't get around David Della Rocco's character. It seems to be he didn't have to be in the movie in the first place as this was more focused on the brothers.I liked the movie and would recommend it to anyone. Of course, all the girls will love this movie, but I know a lot of guys loved this too. Troy Duffy has made a sequel since then and once I watch that, I will review it.",The Boondock Saints

Two meat packaging worker has the strong faiths and goes to the church regularly. But their lifes change in a bar-fight with Russian mafia. Dilemma is here and the heroes have to kill bad men but this idea conflicts with their faith. However, they start the adventure in spite of the smart detective of FBI who has the same dilemma with them. So in one way he allows the operations that they made although he looks for the shape of murders. They kill almost the whole bad men in the city with their crazy friend Rocco. Rocco helps them to update ""bad men list"" and they make the numbers of murders increase but Rocco is killed by the men who priorly hire him for courier. They start to work for Duce although he is hired for the Rocco's murderers. They and Duce kill boss of the Rocco's murderers with an amazing prayer in the court. and citizens in press: They answer the question ""should bad men be killed somehow without guarding laws?"".This amazing story let us examine crime and fine concepts sometimes with an interesting question? ""Are the saints necessary for every city in USA?"". I think this can be serious argument subject but as some of the people said everybody can kill everybody with a reason of hostility. While there are too many crime type like rape, murder, theft etc. in the world and if theses can't be prevented with legal ways, these heroes may be useful sometimes.As a summary, the film says that it can be regarded as normal good people can do bad actions to prevent badness.",The Boondock Saints
130,varundelpiero,Killing in the name of...,9,19 November 2008,"""...the indifference of good men..."" O.k., let's get right into it...I'll admit up front that movies dealing with vigilantism are usually made in poor taste, serving only to appeal to the visceral. I'll also admit that films which use religion as a counterpart to the vigilantism are also made in bad taste. I am fully aware of the negative comments that THE BOONDOCK SAINTS have received from a number of 'esteemed' folks who denigrate this movie as tasteless, stereotypical, childish, etc. I urge these 'critics' to take a closer look at the movie; beyond the stylised violence and the Hollywood lines lies a film that delves deeply into the heart of vigilantism and justice in a manner that has not been seen before.Indeed, very few films deal with this clichéd subject matter as effectively, and with as little pretentiousness, as THE BOONDOCK SAINTS. Where the religion aspect is incorporated does not degrade the film but actually uplifts it (no pun intended) as this is the one of the few films of its kind to be so awesomely effective. Yes, this film is overly stylish. Yes, it contains Hollywood-styled dialogue. Yes, it contains a killer score (again, no pun intended). And yes, there are obvious visible flaws. But the end result is much more than the sum of its parts, and the mock interviews at the end of the film serve to drive the point home: that when it comes to vigilantism, people, regardless of religion or race or social status, have always been highly divided.The acting is nothing to marvel at, as Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are effective without being too flashy. Their interaction is quite good, and serves as a driving point for this vehicle. Willem Dafoe shines in one of his strangest roles of all time, as the somewhat effeminate yet masculine homosexual FBI detective who continually questions whether the actions of the brothers are right or wrong. Bill Connolly has a good cameo here, and is reliable as ever, and David Della Rocco is also quite good. None of the cast is superb, but in a film such as this, they don't really need to be.Suffice it to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Not only was I viscerally excited and entertained as the body count rose in increasingly stylish fashion, but no movie has made me think so seriously about the very nature of vigilantism and the inadequacies of the justice system (except maybe Christopher Nolan's BATMAN BEGINS and THE DARK KNIGHT, where the character already had the monetary means to carry out his plans, and Showtime's DEXTER, where the character already had the know-how and information to carry out his plans).THE BOONDOCK SAINTS is an excellent and exceptional movie. For this reason I am prepared to rate it as a 9/10 and give it 3.5 stars. This movie should enter my Top 100 at #77. Highly recommended.",The Boondock Saints
131,cwbellor,Duffy Gets Away with Murder,1,10 January 2010,"The Boondock Saints is an entertaining and yet incredibly flawed movie. The two main characters are the McManus brothers. From the start we don't know much about them. We know that they're Irish, they like to drink, they like to fight and they work in a meat plant. Oh wait, they also speak five languages ...and yet they work in a meat plant. St. Patty's Day gets off to a rough start when the two of them get in a fight with a big, man-hating lesbian at their job. What do we know about this woman? Well, she's big, she hates men and she's a lesbian. But the trouble really starts for the brothers when three big, angry Russian gangsters walk into their bar. We don't know much about these guys either. We know that they're big, they're angry, they're Russian and they're gangsters. A fight ensues where one of the big Russians gets tied to a bar and his ass lit on fire. The next day, the McManus brothers seem quite surprised when the Russians break into their loft seeking revenge. After all, it was only a bar fight. To cut to the chase, the brothers receive a message from God and they determine that it is their divine mission to become vigilante gangster killers. They are delighted when they gain access to a small arsenal of guns. We don't know if they have a history of handling guns, but hey, they're Irish and they like to fight, so why wouldn't they like guns? As well as going after Russian gangsters, they go after Italian gangsters led by a powerful crime boss. What do we know about this guy? Well, we know that he's Italian, he likes salami sandwiches and he's a crime boss. We do have the pleasure of meeting at least one complex character in this movie. Willem Dafoe plays a closeted gay FBI agent who is a genius investigator. Unfortunately, he really can't save this movie. One of the biggest problems with Saints is not what we see, but what we DON'T see. The brothers talk about the lack of justice in the world and the victimization of innocent people. So naturally, they go after guys who have victimized innocent people, right? Well... actually we don't really know if they've hurt innocent people. I mean, the guys they kill are gangsters so we can assume they've hurt people, but we never see them do that. As a result, the act of killing these men feels like a hollow achievement. Perhaps we should despise these evil men, but we don't. How can we despise men who we know NOTHING about? We're introduced to a particular group of men about to be killed by our heroes. The men are sitting and talking in a hotel room. What have they done to deserve death? Umm... they're sitting and talking in a hotel room. Our heroes go to a porn show where a few gangsters watch a stripper. What have they done to deserve death? Umm... they're watching a stripper. But the really big problem I have with this movie is one that admittedly doesn't say anything about the quality of the film. This movie is set in Boston. So where is the Irish mob??? If these brothers are so righteous in their pursuit of justice, why only go after the Italians and Russians? A more interesting movie would have involved the brothers being recruited by Irish mobsters only for the two of them to turn on them, as well as kill the local Russians and Italians. Then as a result of their killing spree, three rival gangs share a common goal of catching and killing two vigilantes. Saints is not without its moments and writer/director Troy Duffy is capable of writing some good scenes. But creatively, he gets away with murder.",The Boondock Saints
132,gazzalodi,"Not a masterpiece, but good popcorn fun for mature audiences",7,9 August 2019,Just re-watched this with my son who is finally old enough to 'get it'. There's something to offend everyone in this film. Leave your triggers outside when you watch it.Low to mid budget revenge fantasy. I actually like it more than most of the stuff Tarantino has done in the last few years. Still it's not a great film. Just a brainless action flick that really isn't trying to be much else.

133,Mustang92,"Terrible, Awful movie",2,25 October 2008,"This movie is done by, clearly, a Quentin Tarantino wannbe. Only, the writer/director of this movie doesn't have near the talent. (At least at this point in his life.) The story is horrible; you can drive a truck through at least 5 major plot holes. The acting? So-so. The directing? What directing? After the opening sequences of this movie, the directing devolves to a hack job.I just watched the movie ""Overnight,"" which is a documentary about Troy Duffy, the director. I can totally understand why this movie didn't sell in Cannes, even with Cassian Elwes as the agent in charge of selling it. No distributor would buy this movie for a theatrical release (of course), but home video, yeah, there was a market for this there. It's got lots of violence and gunplay, so if that's all you care about, you'll probably like this movie. The fact that half of the violence in this movie is not motivated (and gratuitous)... hey, who cares as long as there's blood and guts, right?? ***Spoiler Alert: And the cat killing scene is a total rip-off from Pulp Fiction. I mean, c'mon, dude. How lame.I can also understand why this guy hasn't been able to get his 2nd movie off the ground to date. I'm sure he will at some point, but if I was an investor, I wouldn't invest in this guy. At least not till he develops his writing and directing ability more. Much more.For those who aspire to be filmmakers, or enjoy the inside scoop of Hollywood, rent ""Overnight."" It's a fascinating account of Troy Duffy's self-destruction.",The Boondock Saints

I wasn't ready for it mainly because I wasn't used to hearing frequent cursing.I'm thirty one now, I watched Boondock Saints on Amazon Prime last night. It's a crazy, clever movie! You can tell Troy Duffy was disgusted with crime and he was bored with movies.The acting is great, everyone agrees regardless of how they feel about the movie. Willem Dafoe steals the show, his character is a arrogant, clever FBI agent. I personally don't think any of these characters are likeable but they're interesting mainly because of the actors.This movie has plenty of humor so you could call it a dark comedy. The humor was hit or miss for me, I chuckled sometimes. Rocco is the funniest character, he acts like he's really high. I didn't like the cat joke or the following scene.The action scenes are cool, they're stylish and over the top. The trick is they're shown while the cops are doing their jobs. The action scenes are mostly shoot-outs, there's no car chases or explosions.I'm glad I gave Boondock Saints another shot, I wasn't ready for it or similar movies when I was in high school.

I can understand why critics didn't like this movie and I can understand why fans love it. It is high on action, has some laughs here and there, stars Willem Dafoe and a young Norman Reedus in what is overall a mediocrely acted film. The concept of vigilantes serving God's justice to bad men who deserve it is a theme that will strike chords with many and Duffy does a good job of not taking the film too seriously. Boondock Saints is a fun and original movie that is deserving of its status as a cult classic.",The Boondock Saints
137,mercury-26,Amateur Night,2,20 March 2000,"If not for a few interestingly conceived and staged action sequences, I would have walked out of the theater before intermission (that's why there are no more intermissions in movies: too many people would just leave most films). Fortunately, and for good reason, ""Saints"" went straight to video and I got to watch it from the comfort of my easy chair.  I watched it because others said it was good.  I can almost see why others liked it but this just wasn't my bag.Boondock Saints is about ridding society of its problems through violence, violence justified by a criminal justice system that has failed us. There's a lot that first-time director Duffy gets right. He certainly communicates what he perceives as the collective ideology and does it with considerable visual style.Though it may never happen in today's Hollywood, this might have been good as a silent film. The best reason? The script is aweful!  Every character (except Willem Dafoe's character) is a cardboard cutout. I didn't know Conner and Murphy MacManus (the title characters, played by Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus respectively) any better than I did after I saw the film than before.Fraternal twins who are all the family each other has, end up killing two members of the Russian mafia and in doing so become heroes of the Boston Police.  Instead of waiting for the mafia to hunt them down, the twins become vigilantes and begin systematically executing criminals that, for whatever reason, the police can't bring in. I think what Mr. Duffy has done with Conner and Murphy is intentionally treat them as one character. Neither, other than having a different face, is distinguishable from the other (being a fraternal twin myself, I find this interesting at best). You'd think that between the two of them, they might be able to come up with enough personality to fill one whole person. Doesn't happen.  Despite this, we're expected to find these two intriguing simply because the odds are against them.Don't get me wrong, I wanted to like this film.  Willem Dafoe's gay FBI agent is a leap above anything we've seen and Dafoe gives it his all.  If this movie could be saved, this would be the character to do it.  The character, Paul Smecker, takes over the investigation of the dead, broken bodies of two Russian mobsters found in an alley.  Before the mobsters' bodies are cold, however, more criminals start ending up dead.  As the investigation progresses, Smecker becomes more and more enraptured by the executioners' style.  From the moment we meet this guy, he's re-enacting each crime moment by moment.  One thing I will say for Duffy--the guy's got potential as a director.  The crime scenes are usually shown and THEN we're shown the executions themselves.  We watch it unfold as Smecker breaks it down.  There's one superb scene in which Smecker WALKS THROUGH THE SCENE with the Saints as they go about their work.The innovative directing, however, isn't enough to save this movie from its too-often stupid dialogue.  I see that on this movie's main page, the user comment calls it ""entertainment in the tradition of 'Pulp Fiction.'""  It's violent, has characters who enjoy using the f-word (on an unprecedented scale), and it messes with time the way only the film medium can, so of course we have to compare it to Pulp Fiction.  When anyone learns to think, visualize, and write the way Tarantino does, THEN we can make those kinds of comparisons.  I expect that Duffy is continuing to write and improve his craft.  He has the tools, but needed a second set of eyes much of the time here.Blockbuster's been promoting it heavily, making it seem like more than what it is: amateurish. It's like a student film that manages to look like a studio film at times.  I fell for it, I admit it (had it not been for the fifty copies sitting on the shelf, I wouldn't have gone anywhere near it). Unfortunately, more people will see this movie than it deserves.

138,underfire35,One of the Worst Films I've Ever Seen.,1,17 March 2003,"THE BOONDOCK SAINTS is not so much a film, as a pastiche of better films.  There is not one single element of this production that has not been used before.  The writing copies Tarantino to the letter, the ""wiseguys"" are third rate Scorsese, the Il Duce character is swiped from LEON (""no women, no kids""), the twin brother angle is apparently stolen from THE KRAYS.  This film is overwrought with religious iconography (seemly only to add some depth to the shallow characters), pretentious without shame, amateurish, obvious, predictable, confusing and dull.  
The director, Troy Duffy, steals ideas and set-ups from the following (in general, specifically when indicated):  Oliver Stone, Luc Besson (LEON), Gary Fleder (THINGS TO DO IN DENVER WHEN YOU'RE DEAD), Peter Medak, Phil Joanou (STATE OF GRACE), Walter Hill, Sam Peckinpah, Antoine Fuqua, Michael Bay (THE ROCK), Michael Mann, Tony Scott, Ridley Scott, Alex Proyas (THE CROW), Robert Rodriguez, John Badham, Michael Winner (DEATH WISH), David Fincher, Guy Ritchie (his ""cool"" Irish films), Danny Cannon, Bryan Singer (USUAL SUSPECTS), the list goes on and on: Paul Verhoeven, Brian DePalma (THE UNTOUCHABLES), John Frakenhiemer, Quentin Tarantino (as director, PULP FICTION), David Mamet, James Ellroy (author), John Woo would be embarrassed with the amount of slow motion in this film.  This is just the short list of the most blatant instances of plagiarism.  Duffy imitates the proven techniques of the above mentioned without understanding why they worked in the first place. He has made a carbon copy film of littered cliches and comes across as desperate to make a name for himself.I simply cannot understand the praise this film receives, it is a turgid mess.  The ""deep moral ramifications"" are transparent.  You have two guys running around murdering people in cold blood.  Has anyone noticed that most of the people they dispatch are unarmed and begging for their lives?  The statements that they make are completely ambiguous: if someone shoplifts they're okay, but if they are part of a shoplifting syndicate, they are marked for death?  What if they repent and never sin again?  How did this ever pass as real film-making?  The staged ""interviews"" under the closing credits only cements the plebian handling of this material.  It seems more like a cop-out really; Duffy did not want to admit that he has made a violent, sadistic, empty film simply for his own benefit, but why not?  Hollywood is awash with such films, he is only jumping on the band-wagon!  Good for him, at least he has found a place to call home.  All the fans of this film, do yourselves a favor (before you deify THE BOONDOCK SAINTS), review the work of those mentioned above and read Dostoyevsky's 'Crime and Punishment' to understand the taking of another human life from a more literate viewpoint.  0/10",The Boondock Saints

Their predisposition towards killing bad guys, probably gleaned from their father, takes off from there and they go after the mob and start killing them off by the truck load.They bring their buddy into the mix who has a scene so funny I was laughing out loud.

140,johnslegers,A superior action film,8,23 July 2010,"""The Boondock Saints"" seems to be one of those films you either hate or love. I'm most definitely among the lovers out there and the reason for this is simple : out of all action films I've ever seen, ""The Boondock Saints"" seemed the most entertaining, the most visually appealing, the most original and the funniest to me.Sure, ""The Boondock Saints"" is no ""Citizen Kane"", but that's something I never expected in the first place. There are some major plot holes, most characters are caricatures and the acting isn't the best around, but if you manage to ignore this there is a lot to like about this film.Being raised in a Flemish labor class family, my cultural background is very much like that of the two main characters. As such, I found the motivations, the philosophy, the personalities and humor of the main characters very recognizable and very appealing. I suspect this may also be a major reason why there are so many haters. If you do not have any affinity with Irish labor class culture or mentality, then you may just not ""get it"". I'm not saying you must be a factory worker to like this film, though. My own job is programming web applications.Then there's the visuals. Duffy opted for a non-linear way of telling his story that with a unique combination of fast-paced action, some experimental editing and a matching music score. While ""Pulp Fiction"" undoubtedly inspired Duffy's style, it's still far too different from Tarantino's typical style or anything else I've ever seen to be considered a rip-off. Tarantino based his own style on the dozens of films from the '70s he saw as a teenager, but does that make ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" any less original or unique?Most of all, though, ""The Boondock Saints"" is just fun. Invite some of your friends over, grab a few beers and just enjoy the fact-paced action, the sometimes very foul-mouthed or very dark humor and debate with your friends whether you'd think it would be a blessing or a curse if ""The Boondock Saints"" were actually real and not just a story made up by Duffy.

141,sullibrandon,"Good plot, good action, good acting",8,1 June 2006,"The Boondock Saints is one of the oddest film phenomena I know of. It has been reviewed by no major critic, was barely in theatres at all, and now has this hugely massive cult following that seems virtually unexplainable. Is this following justified? Does Boondock Saints actually live up to all the hype about it. Well, yes and no.The movie tells of two Irish brothers who get caught up in some sort of mob action. From there, they give themselves up to the police, and are subsequently released. Then they decide that it is their mission to kill all the bad guys. From the get go, the plot is slightly confusing. This does not detract too much from it, though. In fact, it actually enhances the story, setting it apart from most ""is killing bad if you kill bad guys"" movies. The violent scenes are told in a very creative fashion, and one in particular is stunningly memorable.Willem Dafoe plays the cop who is after these guys. Though his acting is nothing mind-blowing, it is very well played, just over the top enough to fit his character, and just subtle enough to make the character believable. The actors who play the Irish brothers are well cast, as well - and they gel quite nicely as brothers.The score of the film is another thing that sets it apart - it is distinct, memorable, and unique. Ominous when it needs to be, joyful at other points, and overall a very nice fit.The Boondock Saints poses some very intriguing questions, and not in a pathetic and obvious way. Though sometimes the excessive violence and seemingly gratuitous sex detract from it, overall it is a well-thought out action flick and completely worth a rental.",The Boondock Saints
142,IRateFilms,Saints should have saved DUFFY,8,24 September 2006,"Troy Duffy's 1999 Debut, Boondock Saints is nothing short of amazing. In an attempt to re-invigorate the styles of Leon:The Professional or Pulp Fiction but with a more dramatic style Boondock Saints never risks disappointing. Circled around two Irish brothers living in the south of Boston, and being messengers of the Lord, this blood-fest never underwhelms or becomes too cheesy. First time screenwriter/director Troy Duffy, masters the art form of cinematography and never becomes repetitive or amateur. In the style of reservoir dogs or snatch, the story is told out of order, but in a new exhilarating manner. Not only does this keep us wanting more, but allows us to view things for multiple angles. The brothers, played by Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flannery, do a great job as the main characters, and never seem to be overacting even with the sometimes over-dramatic dialog. Willem Dafoe plays a homosexual FBI agent with an affinity to classical music, and a psychotic manner of uncovering crime scenes. His character is somewhat reminiscent of the great Gary Oldman in The Professional, only with a side of homosexuality to boot. The soundtrack, performed by The Brood (a band including Troy Duffy his brother and two other friends) adds intensity to the beautiful violence that encounters scene after scene. Too bad Duffy destroyed his career with his bitter pretentiousness, and did not continue to grace the screen with such magic.",The Boondock Saints
143,LeroyBrown-2,"Not quite Tarantino, but very good.",8,18 August 2017,"I have reviewed about 60 films on this site, I'm really not that into it. But occasionally I see a film that I have to say something about. ""The Boondock Saints"" is one of those movies. It's a bloody comedy crime film. It's also a bloody good time. The writing is not as clever as a Tarantino film but certainly very good on it's own. The movie is about a pair of Irish brothers who takes justice into their own hands to kill mobsters in Boston. In pursuit of them is an FBI agent who is seriously conflicted. He knows they are criminals but as the same time he wish he could be them. The agent is played by the great Willem Dafoe, who plays the role just over the top to chew up and steal every scene, without destroying the movie. I think the problem with this movie was that its release was not well handled The scene were the brothers fell through the ceiling. Alone had it been featured on the TV ad. Would guarantee at least 1 million tickets sold. The filmmaking was excellent. I think the director Troy Duffy might actually be better than Quentin Tarantino behind the camera what he needs is a better writer (Duffy wrote the screenplay by the way).",The Boondock Saints

Switching abruptly between screaming and an indication of quiet introspection is not great acting. Throwing in anything that pops into your head is not the art of building a character that gives anything affecting to an audience. This is embarrassing exhibitionism in place of acting technique. Regarding the script: it's a benighted attempt at sensationalism; the hoary old ""blurred lines between criminals, police, clergy"" thing has been around for centuries -- these filmmakers think they discovered it, and that they need not bring anything fresh to the table. Because the acting is so bad you can't even call it acting, and the script so inept, not once do we suspend our disbelief. We never really care about any of the characters, and the extreme violence is pointless and unearned. Juxtaposing unearned extreme violence with the sound of choirboys singing is hacky, not edgy. Rough crime fighter in drag seducing bad guy, then pulling off the wig and grimacing before beating him was done a lot better five years earlier in the Indian film BAAZI, but the concept was thoroughly unconvincing in that movie too -- in both cases it smacked of a desperate attempt to be trendy and outrageous . . .",The Boondock Saints
149,AnusPresley,Troy Duffy is no Guy Ritchie,2,9 November 2012,"Imitation may be the sincerest form of flattery, but it does not make a crap film great. When you imitate to pay homage, you are expected to bring something new to the table to justify the indulgence. This is a very lame attempt to mimic the previous years magnificent _Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels_, but devoid of its wit, style and elegance and likewise devoid of any meaningful plot. This goes straight into the ""most overrated films of all time"" pile. Willem Dafoe, who I normally love, is simply awful here, over acting in an effort to bring some substance to an otherwise shallow character. I somehow doubt this is a film he would place prominently in his resume. The film itself is equally shallow - being little more than a series of highly stylized and gratuitous violent set pieces glued together with bubble gum and cardboard. And what exactly was the purpose of portraying Dafoe's character as gay in a single scene with an Asian toy-boy if there is no relevance or expansion on the theme? It's all just like a bunch of Youtube clips glued together in a collage.I will not say ""don't see this film"". It is something you should view, if only to further aggravate yourself to see how Hollywood can ruin anything. It is one of those rare films that made me want to hurl my beer bottle at the TV.

When I read what it was about and when I read certain reviews I had the feeling this was a movie with substance. A movie that wants to explore the human urge of their own justice. Of being judge, jury and executioner. What I got was something else. No big deal right? Well, every person in the movie (except maybe the 2 leads) act like lunatics. They are all cartoonesk characters who say the F work all the time. I don't care about the F word but it didn't have substance so it got real tiring real fast. Annoying even. Maybe the erratic behavior of Willem Dafoe and consorts are meant to be funny. Well, I for one don't see what's funny about it. I only chuckled a bit at the end.

151,morkulv_athferion,Shameless ripoff,1,24 December 2008,"Damn, this is really the most shameless Quentin Tarantino ripoff ever. Every action-scene reminds me of something in Pulp Fiction, but only a lot more crappy. The acting is dull and uninspired, and a lot of the lines of the actors sound like they are reading cue-cards or something. What I also thought, is that a lot of the action seemed out of place sometimes and even kinda random. I don't know why, but this movie just tries too hard to be ultra-violent I think. Willem Dafoe does a miserable job of trying to portray a detective that desperately needs some vacation. Some scenes with him are just plain ridiculous, and thats a shame because I know Willem Dafoe is a good actor and I enjoy a great deal of other movies he has played in.The plot (if there even is a plot) is also a big problem. Its just so damn random. The only thing this movie is about are 2 Christian brothers who are out to kill every 'evil' person in the name of god. Thats it. Other then just being a ridiculous concept, its just unrealistic in every way. Maybe some die-hard christians will love it, but even they have to admit how utterly uninspired the plot is. I'm not going to spoil any of it, but I can tell you that the film doesn't have any type of development in the story what so ever. The whole movie just seems to be random a lot of times. The 2 brothers find somebody who is 'evil' in their perspective, they kill him, and detective Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe) tries to solve who the murderer's are. Paul Smecker also does a shitty job as a detective seeing how much of a mess the 2 brothers are leaving.The Boondock Saints is a popular title nowadays and I can definitely see why it got so many hype, but the truth is that it really isn't all that special and the content that is worth watching I can bet that a lot of people have seen already in either a Quentin Tarantino movie or in some other movie.

155,tohu,"fast-paced, quite funny and very violent",5,1 June 2006,"I call this a 'mood' film: you have to be in a certain mood before you can watch it. It is a bit out of the ordinary, a 'different' kind of film. There's nothing wrong with that - far from it. But it is a risk for any film-maker, and in this case I'm not sure it quite comes off.The story centres around two young Irish brothers who embark on a vigilante shooting spree to kill all the crime lords of the city. In doing so they display huge creativity and a strict moral code which wins support in the community and even in the police force which is always hot on their tails.The film's low budget status is signposted by the casting of unknown actors Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as the main protagonists, but they acquit themselves well - even looking plausibly related and giving a good portrayal of the quixotic relationship that exists between two close brothers. Willem Defoe, however, steals the film as the off-beat detective in hot pursuit, while Billy Connolly provides the curiosity factor by appearing as the crime lord of all crime lords - complete with cod Irish accent.Now, I am a huge fan of Conolly's stage performances. I have followed his career since I was a boy, and I genuinely think he is one of the funniest people on the planet. But I have never really bought his film and TV roles, and his role here is a classic example of that. He is not on screen for long but his character is pivotal to the plot - especially towards the end - and his deficiencies as an actor become increasingly obvious and undoubtedly harm the whole enterprise, undoing a lot of the good work that has been done in building up the first half of the film.Because there is good stuff here. It is funny, original, unpredictable and thought-provoking. It is also very violent - but not in the gratuitous, unpleasant sense. It's an intelligent film, meant for an intelligent audience. The smart, stylish direction doesn't give you much time to ponder - it's not a film you can nip out in the middle of and make a cup of tea - but the furious pace keeps you glued to the screen and wondering just what will happen next. At half way through, I already knew it wasn't going to be a classic, but I definitely wanted to keep watching until the end.What ultimately lets the film down, apart from Connolly's bizarre performance as 'Il Duce,' is the script. Tight and funny in parts, it seems at times to lose focus and in a film which is not the easiest to follow at the best of times, that is not an endearing characteristic.I wonder if I'm being a bit harsh in giving 'The Boondock Saints' a score of 5. It is probably a bit better than that. But I return to my original point: if you are in the mood to see something a bit different, then you will definitely get something out of this one. If not, and if you're looking for a nice relaxing movie to unwind in front of after a long day, you're likely to find it a bit irritating.",The Boondock Saints

Had never heard of it until a couple days ago - on a Screen Junkies video - and since it was being praised and Willem Dafoe, I decided to give it try. Dafoe is exactly the best part of it. Over the top, funny and really full-on crazy, his character carries the whole film not letting it turn boring and stale. Another fresh idea are the flashbacks. I wasn't expecting they'd choose this route to illustrate the most of the action scenes and it surely delivers. It's very interesting to look at the crime scene and at the same time as the cops, try to find out what happened. Unlike what I've seen written about this specific part of the film, it's not like it gets too much repetitive since as Smecker is closer to finding out who are ""The Saints"" he too gets incorporated in this action scenes, in quite spectacular fashion. The rest of the cast, specially Reedus, Flanery and the first-timer Della Rocco also make for interesting performances, despite not at the same level. The film is visceral, ""balls to the wall"" and certainly feels fresh, with some inventive camera work and choreography. The action scenes felt gripping and somewhat intense.Recommended",The Boondock Saints
158,Shecky J. O'Pootertoot,"If it's not Scottish, it's crap!",2,3 June 2001,"The Boondock Saints is so incredibly bad, I eventually embraced it with a sick fascination, watching as it ripped off so many of my favorite movies (""Oh, I remember that form that Tarantino, Rodriguez, Woo, Ritchie, Stone, Scorcese Movie!""). I almost don't know where to begin, so I'll start with the one scene that I liked. It was between Willem Dafoe and a priest in confessional as Dafoe struggles with his conscience. It was surprisingly well written and well acted and is the only redeeming scene in the whole film, to be honest.The fact that this movie blatantly steals scenes from other, better movies is not what makes it so bad (but now that I think of it, stealing is one of the crimes that is punishable by death according to the Saints. We should be so lucky). No, what makes Boondock Saints bad is that it does such a poor job of ripping them off. John Woo might consider dying early so he can start spinning in his grave. I can practically see him taking a razor to his own wrist during the laughable shoot-out between the Saints and Billy Connelly (that's right, I said Billy Connelly). Woo might say something like, ""What have I wrought? The horror, the horror!"" right before his arterial spray covered his big screen television. Another tragic, Boondock Saints related death.You might find yourself asking certain questions while watching this movie. Fear not, for I have the answers you seek! For example you might say to yourself, how are these guys with so good at killing when they have no experience and their basic attack plans involve standing in the center of rooms surrounded by bad guys with only a handgun in each paw and some cool sunglasses. That's easy - It's obvious that they've seen John Woo films and know that a guy firing two guns at once looks too damn cool to get killed, and because all these scenes are in unnecessary slow motion shots it gives them plenty of time to dodge the bullets. Another question you might ask is why is the Willem Dafoe character gay when it's obvious that writer/director Troy Duffy knows even less about gay people than I do? What a silly question. It's so that Duffy can have ridiculous scenes where Dafoe prances around crime scenes while listening to CDs on his portable disc player as if he were conducting an orchestra instead of gathering evidence. So he can include clever scenes of Dafoe calling his lover a fag because he wants to cuddle and saying something similar to a bartender at a gay bar. See, he's a macho homosexual. He's a rebel. He doesn't play by the rules, and he sure as hell doesn't cuddle. Oh, and we must not forget the scene where Dafoe dresses up as a blond prostitute so he can infiltrate the mob's headquarters. I would have liked to see how this movie played in San Francisco. I can picture men turning to the person next to them and saying, ""We don't act like that, do we?"" Why do they say a prayer before whacking the bad guys? Don't you know anything? It's because they've seen Pulp Fiction, only Samuel L. Jackson's character was more honest about his motivations for quoting the Bible.Some random complaints I have - an extremely poor attempt at capturing the randomness, shock and surprise of Vincent Vega and Marvin's ""explosive"" conversation in the back of Jules' car in Pulp Fiction. A little of Rocko goes a long way, and I felt cheated when he wasn't given a slow, painful death. It would be my guess that Rocko's command of the english language is not the greatest as he seems to only know about fifty words, half of which begin with ""F"" and end in ""K"". How did Billy Connelly become such a feared hitman when his method of whacking a guy involves standing in the middle of the street in broad daylight with a bunch of guns under his trench coat and waiting to be seen before firing. This could only seem like an ambush to the Saints, probably thinking, ""Why didn't we think of that?"" Rocko's extremely old and lame joke that grinds the movie to a dead halt. And the list goes on.Those wacky Weinstien brothers - when they're not frequenting bars looking for the next Quintin Tarantino or Kevin Smith, they're buying Oscars (I'll never forgive them for robbing Saving Private Ryan of Best Picture). Guys, stick to what you know best. The money spent making this film would have been better spent on the catering budget on the next Scream film. Someone really has to feed Courtney Cox. Apparently lack of food has made her dizzy and she accidentally married David Arquette. Someone get her a Twinkie, STAT! But I digress. This movie is a terrible waste of time. It was recommended to me by some young crack addicts who thought it was the greatest film ever made. But that seems to be the general consensus regarding this film. People love it. So I guess that makes me wrong this time, does it? No, that can't be it. Everyone else is wrong, I'm right. 2/10 stars for this turkey. G'night!",The Boondock Saints
159,Pigalina,"Pretty good, a little hard to follow",5,15 August 2005,"I thought it was just me, but the other three people I watched this with also found it a little hard to follow. That aside it was a rather good film. Two Irish brothers decide to rid Boston of the evil men - the mafia, hit men etc. (I'm not sure if the woman who is mentioned at the very start, who was murdered while others did nothing, is the mother of the brothers and therefore their motivation - it wasn't clear). Anyway, the guys go around killing the bad guys and manage to get away with it. Willem Dafoe plays the FBI agent who is trying to solve the case. He appears in one scene in drag, looking a bizarre mix of attractive and ugly. Billy Connelly also turns up as an assassin. There is another man too, ""Funny Man"", who helps the brothers in their quest only he's not very good at shooting, nor very discreet. There is a great scene where Smecker (Dafoe) explains what he thinks happened at a crime scene, where he enacts it along with the actual shooters. There is also a rather cringe-inducing scene where the men use an iron to cauterize their cuts and bullet wounds. The opinion of the people of Boston is split between them being saints (Boondock saints y'see) or being just as bad as the people they are trying to get rid of. I will add a point on for Willem Dafoe in drag, but I have to deduct a few for being a little hard to follow.",The Boondock Saints
160,newfiesailor,A Strange ride.,8,26 April 2006,"Bizarre, graphic tale of two Irish lads from a Boston neighborhood who get embroiled in a clash with the Russian mafia that lead them waging a holy war on the hoods of the city. Wildly entertaining with some outlandish performances by Willem Dafoe, Billy Connelly and newcomer David Della Rocco. Unfettered swearing, gore galore and some genuine funny moments make this a movie for the macho masses.Willem Dafoe plays a gay FBI agent tracking the executions of the young hit men squad and ends up admiring the boys and their mission. He is over the top and hilarious as the brilliant G-man who regularly puts the inept Boston Police Homicide Squad to shame. Billy Connolly is almost unrecognizable as the fearsome ""Il Duce"", a furry hit-man released from prison by the mob to track down the boys. David Della Rocco as the wild ""Funny Man"" is a riot to watch on the screen. The two boys, played by Flannery and Reedus have an on screen chemistry with so much charisma, it has us rooting for them at every turn. Even porn star Ron Jeremy shows up as a sleazy Russian underboss and as you guessed it: nails the role.For those negative reviews you read on this movie, it's from those who never got swept away in the zaniness of it all and took it too serious. Please gentlemen, just enjoy the ride and take it for what it is. It's not Casablanca or Citizen Kane, nor does it try to be.One-liners zing, animals are splattered against walls, James Bond style hits, torture scenes, cartridge flying gunfights, bar fights and even court room drama make this a manic adventure in the style of Tarantino. My one problem with the film is it aims to convey a disturbing message near the end instead of letting us revel in the wild ride. Still, this almost cartoonish adventure is to be indulged by action fans who want style and uniqueness in their viewing. Chances are, you will either love this movie or hate it, but either way, it will affect you. One of the best of the genre.",The Boondock Saints
161,Kevin_Maness,More cool than good,6,12 June 2006,"College students love Boondock Saints (speaking in generalities, of course). And college students often have a good eye for what's cool (on the other hand, if facebook is any authority, The Notebook tops the list of popular movies in many colleges, so perhaps I need to revisit my ""college students know cool"" theory). And, I suppose, Bookdock saints was cool, but it was NOT a great movie, in my opinion.The thing I liked best about Boondock Saints was its portrait of three central characters (the twins and Rocco) who really made no distinction in their own minds between real life and movies. I loved the bit with the brothers using the ventilation shaft to enter a hotel room, and of Rocco thinking he's Wyatt Earp, wielding two handguns to blast his victims. The whole idea of vigilante justice, of course, is intertwined with media representations of crime, justice, and violence in our culture. The movie was at its best when it immersed itself in this weird postmodern hyper-reality.I think the movie falls short of greatness because the filmmakers are just not that good. In a funny, ironic way, I think the filmmakers are almost exactly like the MacManus brothers. Like the Saints, the filmmakers scrabble together a lot of really cool things they've seen in movies like The Usual Suspects, True Romance, and Tarantino's films, and because they're imitating and remixing ""cool"" source material, they sometimes succeed in creating some cool cinema. Like the Saints, the filmmakers here are well-intentioned and lovable, but maybe not all that competent, when it comes down to it. After watching the whole movie, I don't get the sense that there's a strong central vision or real coherence to the movie. Although the idea is solid, the dialogue is less-than-stellar, and the cinematography sometimes makes the film look like a made-for-TV movie. Still, to the extent that Troy Duffy is the ""auteur"" here, it's not at all bad for a directorial debut. I'd probably see a follow-up, if there ever is one (not a sequel--God forbid; that would be a really misguided venture--what I mean is that I'd see a sophomore directorial effort by Duffy).I enjoyed Boondock Saints, but boy am I ever glad I rented it from Netflix instead of impulse buying the DVD! Did I use the word ""cool"" a lot in this review? I think that's significant, actually. I just get the sense that Duffy is far more interested in making a cool movie than in making good cinema.

162,Lunchbox-8,Well directed crime flick with good characters.,9,18 January 2001,"""Boondock Saints,"" despite it's usual negative review, is a good film. The way that the events were layed out was unique in that the events weren't on a time-line, a crime was first investigated and then it was acted out by the criminals.  This creative style yielded positive results in that it turned the film into more of a work of art than a teenage crime flick. Good directorial skills truly are responsible for the transtion from a good movie into a great movie.  I regret that the producers opted not for a theater release, which probably would have made the movie a box-office smash, rather than a somewhat cult film for teenagers who just liked the great action sequences.Sticking back to the subject, ""Boondock Saints"" was a good movie.  In fact, it is one of the best crime dramas I have ever seen.  The shootouts and crimes were thrilling and interesting.  The cast and acting provide a substantial amount of quality for the movie, due primarily to the main role, played by one of my favorite actors, Willem Dafoe.  You may remeber him as the compassionate Vietnam martyr in the academy award winning ""Platoon."" he used his on screen grace to master the role as a homesexual detective trying to crack the case of his life.  Don't get me wrong, the twin brothers, Conner and Murphy Macmanus, were great characters.  Both displayed raw emotion and feelings, pain and joy. Their kind personalitys but countless homicides gave us a tough moral question: is it wrong to kill criminals?

The media soon christens them saints and the brothers feel they have been baptized (a cheesy leaking roof jail sequence)The brothers are supported by an Italian hirsute fellow called Rocco who knows the whereabouts of all the Italian Mafiosi scum in the world as he used to be one of them -- why he should not be killed is another matter.Thrown in is a gay and melodramatic FBI inspector Willem Defoe (the highlight of the movie) who generally retells each of their crime scene through his Poirot like deductions and Gary Old man like dancing on western classical opera music.High on style, gore and bizarre characters and very thick on blood and accents boondock saints is fun to watch while it lasts but actually is just an idea movie which could have been easily been spawned while watching Samuel L Jackson spewing Ezekiel 25:17 in Pulp Fiction. As a matter of fact in one surprising scene done with as much taste as the one in pulp fiction an accident triggering splotches a cat on the wall just for the heck of it, in another one a bad dude just happens to be in a toilet when the saints decide to clear a poker room full of bad blood only to enter later to cause problems.

165,billyfish,Not deserving of its semi-cult following,1,29 December 2007,"Why is Willem Dafoe in this movie? It demeans him. It starts well enough, with two Irish blue-collar brothers ridding the world of some Russian mafia scumbags. However, it soon devolves into the worst kind of bad acting, improbable situations, and ridiculous developments that you've ever had the misfortune to see. Ron Jeremy is one of the best actors in the film -- that should tell you everything! He's actually better at playing his scumbag role than Dafoe is.Willem Dafoe as an openly gay, long-hair hippy psychotic FBI agent is insulting to anyone who is not certifiably paranoid. Later in the film, the scenes when he is ""conducting"" the crimes he is investigating are so ludicrous that they are actually amusing. Amusing, and embarrassing. I hope they paid him well for this particular buffoonery. Willem, hang your head in shame! Yakovetta? Who decided that was an Italian name? One of the Russian mafia bosses (a man) was named ""Petrova"" -- a female name. The writers of this travesty are idiots.I have to say this is one of the worst movies I have ever finished. There are a few more that I've turned off, or walked out of, but after finishing this one, I felt soiled. I can't believe that someone told me this was a good movie.The soundtrack was not bad, but I felt embarrassed and ashamed for the musicians, as the music was overly grandiose for the trivial and idiotic scenes it was attempting to embellish.The moronic scene where the moronic ""Funny Man"" Rocco has died, and the moronic Irish brothers pray over him, is, well, moronic. I overuse the word purposely! It's insulting and incredibly amateurish. A high school film student would have done better.I can't believe that Dafoe can sleep at night after having made this incredibly horrible film. I bought the DVD on a discount rack, and I'm going to throw it in the trash where it belongs.",The Boondock Saints
166,epsilon3,Quite Good,7,29 March 2003,"Boondock Saints is an interesting film that's worth seeing. It's the story of two devoutly religious American Irish men who decide (are chosen?) to kill a lot of the underworld lowlife in their neighbourhood.The main questions raised in the film concern the legitimacy of killing criminals and the failure of the justice system, all mixed up with some religious symbolism.If you think this all sounds really heavy and deep, think again. As one previous reviewer pointed out, this movie steals from lots of other action/gangster films such as 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Pulp Fiction.' There's a lot of stylised violence, slow motion and flashbacks. The whole thing is self consciously hip in a Tarrantino kind of way which can be a good thing, and in this case it mostly works.
The plotline and acting are quite good. One minute your eyes are assaulted by violence, and the next you're laughing as something funny happens - it's quite unusual in that it mixes the two fairly successfully. At times some of what happens verges on the ridiculous (when they fall out of the ventilation shaft) but it all fits in with the tongue in cheek nature of the picture.One thing worth mentioning is the terrible accents and Irish cliches. It's up there with 'Shaft' as an example of taking the traits of a particular grouping and amplifying them tenfold. Take it from me - not every Irish person is a cheeky chirpy chappy who is always happy to buy you a pint of Guinness, a drunk salt of the Earth type or a Westlife style pretty boy! And the barman who mixes up his proverbs and swears a lot is straight from 'Father Ted'!Still, this didn't detract from the proceedings too much and I thoroughly enjoyed the film. It's nowhere near the greatest film ever as some reviewers have said here (what planet are such people on? I suspect they're impressed with fancy editing and guns) but it's good entertainment and a nice first time effort from Troy Duffy (although I'd like to see something a little more original next time.)Rent it or buy it cheap.",The Boondock Saints

I caught it mentioned on a few message boards, noticed wallpapers for it on deviantart and I saw some guy at a tattoo shop wearing a t-shirt. So I finally gave in and decided to give it a viewing. While waiting for it to show up in the mail I read over the reviews for it, both on IMDb and RT, basically what I saw: either people really liked it or didn't.Last night, after having the movie sit next to my DVD player for the last 4 weeks I finally decided to give it a viewing.eh... I'm about Luke warm with the movie, it was alright but nothing that didn't make me go WHOA! Or have me wonder when the movie would end. It was mildly entertaining and to a small degree I was able to overlook how choppy the storyline got but at the same time I was a little annoyed with the feeling that some things were over explained meanwhile other things were excessively glossed over.The situations the twins got themselves into were entertaining, a bit over the top but it worked well for the movie, especially their second successfully blundered hit on the Russian mob bosses So many things were just sort of tossed into the movie... the big angry lesbian at the start of the movie or the bartenders turrets syndrome that sort of came & went, the twins spoken languages, the hokey non-explanation of Il Duce or the extremely skimmed over capture of the twins by the Italian Mafia.The movie seems heavily inspired by Quentin Tarantino, specifically Pulp Fiction but sadly the writer didn't understand that story is a key element in a good movie, not just the basis of the idea.Like I said, the movie was alright, I didn't come out hating it but at the same time I can only give the movie a 5/10",The Boondock Saints
168,Flyer78,Far from an ordinary action film,10,30 June 2009,"If you are a big action fan, but you are getting somewhat tired of the standard action movie car chases, fights, and explosions that seem thrown into the movie so it can be called an action film, this movie is ideal for you.The story is told from three different perspectives, so you have to think about what's going on. But don't get me wrong. It's not the type of complexity that makes you frustrated to the point where you have absolutely no clue what's happening. You just have to keep up with the three perspectives, and I found it pretty fun seeing the main story from the three different characters and how they all found out different things at different times.The main perspective focuses on Agent Smecker,a very intelligent, yet somewhat crazy detective who handles organized crime murders and things of that nature. He basically tries to track down the twin brothers, and tries to figure out all of the clues to the murders they commit.The secondary perspective (although some consider it the main perspective) revolves around two twin brothers named Conner and Murphy who are avid Christians, and they believe that they are saints and God wants them to rid the world of evil so all of the innocent can thrive. So the two twins eventually decide they will kill all evil people in the world like mobsters and pimps until the world has been ""cleansed"".And lastly, there is the story as told from the perspective of mob boss Papa Joe. He is the main target of Conner and Murphy, and he has organized the murders of several men.All of the perspectives and details I have mentioned sound pretty ordinary and generic, but I didn't want to give any spoilers, because there are plenty of twists and turns, as well as more characters that appear, so if you want to know all of the bigger details that shift up the story, you're going to want to watch this for yourself. Everyone plays a unique part in the story, and by the end, everything comes together perfectly, and you realized that you have just watched easily one of the most creative movies of the past decade.10/10",The Boondock Saints

Many filmmakers have tried to duplicate Tarantino's style and ""Boondock Saints"" is another one of those films. Do you know what that original film was? Your right, it was ""Pulp Fiction."" Regardless of how much ""influence"" ""Pulp Fiction"" has had on the making of ""Boondock Saints,"" is ""Boondock Saints"" a good or a bad film?Two Irish brothers feel that they have had a mission from God to get rid of evil human beings. FBI agent Paul Smecker, while trying to figure out the murders, discovers that what the boys are doing is right. By fighting for truth and justice, are the Irish brothers accepted by the public or are they considered cold hard murderers? ""Boondock Saints"" is a lousy film, and it is not only because it is a ""Pulp Fiction"" wannabe because throughout history we have seen film, television, and or literature that borrows significantly from something else. ""Boondock Saints"" had a lot of potential because of the premise but the writing is not very good. Even though they infused many bits from ""Pulp Fiction,"" if this reviewer had a lot of fun of viewing the movie, it would not have mattered.Like ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""Boondock Saints"" puts a lot of emphasis on the crime/action genre, sprinkled with comedic elements throughout, but the problem is ""Pulp Fiction"" was actually funny. This reviewer laughed more unintentionally then intentionally. In fact, the funniest intentional part of the movie was done a lot better in ""Pulp Fiction."" It got to the point where it felt like an unintentional parody on the genre.The acting was okay. Billy Connolly is one of the bright spots as Il Duce. William Dafoe is the main reason to watch this film as a gay FBI agent, Paul Smecker. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus plays two Irish twins. Though they are twins, the viewer will feel that they are just a bit closer then that (if you know what this reviewer means.) David Della Rocco was just as pointless as his character, Rocco. The biggest error of film is casting Ron Jeremy as a member of the mafia, Vincenzo Lipazzi. Lesson in film, if you want to be taken seriously, never cast Ron Jeremy.In conclusion, you could watch something a lot better then ""Boondock Saints."" If Billy Connolly and William Dafoe were not in there, this reviewer would probably say that this film could not have gotten any worse. The whole film felt like it was trying to be too cool. Though just because you say the F-word and fire many bullets, does not mean that you are cool.

There just happens to be two brothers in particular, who seek out the evil of Boston and hunt them down at all costs. I thought this was a great idea. So did Troy Duffy, Troy is the director, writer and creator of the Saints. Troy apparently wrote the script at this bar he had been working for at the time. Some director came to the bar one particular night and helped Troy begin the Saint movies.I personally think this film deserved more credit then it was handed. The movie did not receive a nomination for any award whatsoever, witch I think is ludicrous, that movie deserved at least some recognition.

The stylized shoot-outs come a distant second.It begins with an interesting enough premise for a plot: A pair of Irish twins living in Boston listen to a Church sermon and agree for no particular reason it's a good idea to rid the world of bad men. When a few Russian Mafia threaten a friend, one thing leads to another and the Mafia end up dead in the back alley.The twins take that as a cue to assassinate all of Boston's gangsters. Here the movie stalls, because we don't know who these gangsters are or what they did. You could drop any of these scenes and it wouldn't make the slightest bit of difference to the story. The stylized shoot-outs are however entertaining, but the movie ends up more like a series of disconnected music videos.I have to admit the twist at the end made me smile, and Willem Dafoe is fun to watch.The paper thin plot is nonetheless full of holes: In one scene Billy Connelly as supposedly the world's greatest hit man, the twins and their ex-Mafia friend exchange fire at point blank range. The world's greatest hit man having emptied six pistols without bringing down a single man turns and runs. Everyone else walks away saying 'F' a lot.""Boondock Saints"" has gained cult status, no doubt because of the disconnected music videos.

The main problem lies in Dafoe's character, who descends into an outrageous cross-dressing cartoon once he begins to sympathize with the boys. Woefully thin stuff--- because this isn't a comedy and it's certainly not a murder mystery (making a ""spoiler"" virtually impossible). Plot-wise, it just plain sucks. Technically, there's some slightly redeeming aspects. The camera work is very good and there's a visually clever insertion of Dafoe placing himself in the midst of a crime scene. The casting of chubby porn star Ron Jeremy (Hyatt) as a Russian (?) mafioso is less than inspired--- he's more cartoony than Dafoe.

182,bkam,"Clever but not Intelligent, Fun but not Philosophical",7,15 June 2003,"The Boondock Saints is a fun movie.  I just finished watching it again, and I have seen it several times since I purchased it six months ago.  One thing I noticed this time was that it is fairly detail-oriented, and the way that the plot unfolds differently from the way that the events proceeded can be confusing.  Many things important to the plot are more or less mumbled.  So my suggestion: don't watch this one when there are people walking in and out of the room, because I found myself explaining what happened many times.That said, the movie is not so difficult once you get used to it, and it's a wild ride from start to finish.  With strong violence, this movie conveys a message that is slightly more elevated than other action flicks, in that it recognizes the gratuity of its own brutality.  The frequent references to movie and television heroes soften the holiness of the protagonists by showing that they have learned not truly from religion, but from pop culture.  Despite this, the religion in the film adds an interesting angle.The acting is sometimes rough, but both Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus look and sound perfect for their characters.  Willem Dafoe goes overboard sometimes but also does his character convincingly.  Rocco provides some comic relief that actually fits quite well into the film.  The rest of the characters are pretty insignificant but play the parts of scum in an effective (if satirical) way.The score is great, very energetic and fun, much like the film itself.  The cinematography is as cool as can be expected from the budget, of which I know nothing but the film as a whole gives the impression that it was not large.Despite its religious overtones, don't expect a movie about morals or philosophy, which is brushed over as good is pitted against evil in a somewhat typical way.  One difference is that this time the good guys are hunting down the bad guys to kill them, whereas in most films the bad guys do the hunting, or the good guys hunt but don't kill, or the good guys end up kiling without hunting.  While the plot of the film is interesting, it is not revolutionary, and even its good ideas are somewhat mitigated by its overall roughness.  To summarize, don't expect a brilliantly intelligent film, but if you're in the mood for a serious action movie with likeable heroes and a knack for humor, this one is a good choice.

Directed and written by a sped who knows less than nothing about directing and writing, the cinematography is dull and ugly, acting is some of the most awful I have ever seen (and yes, I did see Cyber Tracker 2), etc. Not to mention that this movie is not funny at all, not even by accident.Well, now that I think of it, there might be one good thing to come out of this vomit-inducing bore-fest.

Too late to do anything with the movie, it was released and fell to scathing critical reviews describing insensitivity and viewers were repelled. However, the question remains: is this even a good movie?Vigilante justice. A provoking topic discussed in this movie and in Dirty Harry (1971), with Clint Eastwood having success. However, in a contest of levels on interest and provocation, the Saints take the bacon. With religious undertones, The Boondock Saints takes two kids with no reason to evoke justice but the ability to and thrusts them into a tri-fold moral conflict. Vigilantes versus cops, good deeds versus sins, and justice versus greed. The screenplay takes all these mental conflicts and combines them with physical conflicts to masterfully weave a story, while emphasizing the youth and naivety of the Saints. But, many times Duffy loses track of his goal and creates ridiculousness of the likes of Woody Allen in Bananas (1971). So is The Boondock Saints, an underestimated Zoolander (2001) or a wildly inappropriate Meet the Fockers (2004)?The acting is mediocre with Willem Dafoe like a stale piece of bread. The editing is abysmal with the simple use of a fade cut for every transition between scenes. The cinematography is purposeful and accentuates the Saints as the bad-asses that would bring in the big bucks. Except where Dirty Harry remains a bad-ass, the Saints are only bad-asses for a few scenes. Obviously they are different vigilantes, but the exposure to the inexperienced actions only aggravates the moral conflict. The score is the only truly beautiful piece of production. Imagine Roman Catholic organ music played to the acts of vigilante justice. Artistic choice at its best.Nevertheless, the plot takes a turn for the worst. Embarrassingly predictable twists and cheesy Hollywood clichés turn the film into a stew of triteness. Like The Empire Strikes Back (1980) with no substance. Yet Duffy saves his production with an excellent finish. But its dramaticism erases all sense of ease in the previous two hours. The scene is scary and chilling.

186,bzb2001,Depraved and Without Merit,1,17 December 2006,"Among the pathways of depravity there lays a mile marker for The Boondock Saints. A film so inertly void of humanity and purpose it rarely saw a theater screen. Although perhaps it should have, the growing number of fans has made this film an alarmingly enormous cult sensation.The plot is a simple vigilante story of two brothers who murder those they see as reprehensible. The fact that they are reprehensible as well is never understood. Masked behind the idea that they are good Irish Catholics, the duo set forth in a violent fury ridding the world of those they deem evil. The detective assigned to apprehend the two is played by Wilem Dafoe in a performance so over the top we forget how good of an actor he really is. And yes, the cop is just as screwed up as the crooks - this is one of those stories. Though he is sent to arrest the wanted men, Dafoe's character is much more interested in making dramatic gestures and compiling evidence while listening to classical music, in a scene of eye-rolling silliness.Along the way the criminal pair pick up a psychotic counterpart who yells a lot and seems so much like the loose cannon they do not need. We learn very little about why the two have set forth on this rampage or where this idiotic third wheel came from, or maybe we do. By this time I had lost any need to pay attention.Following in the ancestry of Tarantino films, The Boondock Saints has the appearance of imitating (badly) a genre on the edge of what is permissible. Because Tarantino's characters utter ""nigger"" does not give clearance for the word to be used in any random situation. This film as a result comes off as racist, xenophobic, homophobic and certainly doesn't put religion in the best light. If there is anything positive about the film, it does excite the thirteen-year-old thrill to see novel executions involving commodes and kitty cats.

You look f**kin' SCARY!",9,28 August 2012,"I was introduced to this movie many years ago, and while it was fun the first time, it's only gotten better with repeated viewing. The cinematography stands out as superb, the direction and pacing of the story excellent, the characters just great. It isn't perfect, and I can see how some people would think it was trying too hard, but it's not like Pulp Fiction wasn't trying just as hard, and it pulled off the coolness necessary to make it work. By and large, this succeeds as well.There are some hilarious one-liners in here, so long as you don't get uptight about political correctness. Half the words spoken by Rocco seem to have a tendency to make people shoot beer out of their noses when I'm watching this with friends. It was made for seven million bucks, and no other action film comes close to its value. Amazing introduction to Troy Duffy. The moral tone of the movie, well, obviously justice is a bit more complex than that, but it's a MOVIE, and the perspective of it is engrossing.Speaking of which, I'll betray some bias of the best kind: While stationed in Africa, Troy Duffy, Norman Reedus, Sean Patrick Flannery, and Brian Mahoney paid us a visit as an MWR function. MWR stuff can be lame, but servicemen LOVE this movie and someone figured that out. The troops were besides themselves, myself included. The four spent several days with us, and I had the unusual experience of watching Boondock 1 and 2 with the cast hanging around, drinking, BS-ing with everyone as if they lived there. I talked to all of them, with Troy and Brian quite a bit. Flannery does combatives, and rolled with the combatives club on base. Troy sent a friend of mine, an aspiring writer, screenplays and script software after they left. They're a fantastic group of guys. If this colors my perspective too much for the review to be taken seriously, all I can offer is that I'd seen the film probably more than twenty times before that deployment and my opinion was just as high before.

190,arson83,simply fantastic...,10,25 October 2003,"I had heard a lot about this movie (friends, online, people's AIM profiles quoting it), but had never rented it or anything. It didn't seem my type.Then, one day, I go to a friends house to watch it and I am BLOWN AWAY by this masterpiece. Masterpiece - I only use that word sparingly (Pulp Fiction, Braveheart, American Beauty...). This movie deserves it. I immediately bought the movie (for $9.99 at Best Buy) and watched it again the next day.The plot is simple - two brothers, Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flannery, go on a killing spree with their friend, David DellaRocco. They vow to take out all the scum in their city (I believe a suburb of Boston or thereabouts, I could be wrong, haven't seen it since I bought it in August 2003). Willem Dafoe plays the homosexual, opera-loving, certifiably-insane, God-loving detective who is trying to track the case.The movie is intense. The ""confessional booth"" scene is amazing. When Dafoe ""enters"" the crime scene, I got chills. The action-sequences are fantastic (don't listen to those who hate the movie, they have nothing better to do). The dialogue isn't brilliant, but it's not fake-brilliance like some movies who want nothing more than to be Tarantino.The ending of the movie is amazing. One of the 5 best endings I've ever seen in a movie (you liked the ending of The Usual Suspects? that had nothing on Boondock Saints). BUT the very last scene is of a reporter interviewing people to see what they think of ""vigilante killings"" and it had nothing to do with the movie and it was horrible. I pretend the movie ends in the courtroom scene.10/10.",The Boondock Saints
191,crackbabyjesus,Nothing special.,3,18 June 2005,"Well, it's not the worst movie I have ever seen, that honor would go to either 3000 miles from Graceland or Batman and Robin. I guess I don't get the hype from fans that surrounds this movie. My buddy bought it and had me come over claiming that it would be one of the best movies I would ever see. Now, prefaced with that kind of statement I guess anyone would be a little let down unless the movie was, say, a true masterpiece. I felt the movie was forced and very pretentious in almost every way. The dialog, the acting, the direction were all void of originality or personality. I actually think that the story surrounding the making of this movie with it's director's rapid rise and fall in Hollywood is much more entertaining. That should be a full length feature film. (I know, I know. There is a documentary already). I generally like Willem Dafoe but he drove me nuts in this. I do not recommend this movie at all, however judging by the other member's reviews I am definitely in the minority.",The Boondock Saints
192,jordman10,This movie so Sucked So Bad A 1.9 at least,1,11 January 2006,OK I don't care what anyone says this movie Really Really Really Sucked. I mean it was terrible. Unlike Tarantino movies it was just pure gore violence sex and language. No Character depth. No Real Plot. No Real Diction. I mean I couldn't Understand a F***'n word they. I'm mean they tried to copy Quentins Crap but completely missed the freakin' point and the fact that everyone loved it prove's that 80% of Americans are dumb ass's. Sacreligous and offensive to all I highly recommend you don't see this movie. Just terrible. Terrible acting. Terrible plot. Just an all out bad movie.

193,Gandalf-2,A future classic!,9,4 August 1999,"First, I was positively surprised by the apparent coolness of the movie. Then, I saw that the motivation of the brothers was quite real and understandable. In my belief it is not allowed to anyone to take what he can't give. You can't destroy what you can't create. So, nobody is allowed to take life, as nobody is able to give life. On the other hand, we can see that fighting evil (which is crime here, but it could be anything else, like environmental sins, racial discrimination or software monopoly) effectively calls for extreme measures, as prison nowadays does not seem to help much. But killing, the way the Saints chose, is not a way to go either. This film, which I loved and enjoyed very much, should not be mistaken as a call for self-justice, it should be taken as what it is: The propaganda of finding the courage for taking steps which are creative, effective, without personal advantage and not thought of yet.",The Boondock Saints
194,tcdarkness,"Good, but not great",2,28 June 2002,"Boondock Saints is something I'd heard a lot of good things about.  As with most films you hear that about, you have to check for the reviewer's taste in movies beforehand.  Most people liked Pulp Fiction and said this was up there with that.  I figured it would be a drop-off and upon viewing the film, still think so.  The plot is good, direction good at times (music is used way past the point of necessity or style, but ok), but the script.... the script was just too hammy for me.  You've got several scenes with a room full of characters and every single one of them is a wise ass.  There is nothing wrong with being a wise ass of having a room full of wiseasses in their own way, but it was almost like a room full of cliches.  You've got the smart-mouth FBI agent without a serious bone in his body, the Boston PD he harasses who take it no matter what like they are missing a pair, two wise-ass brothers, a pop-off sidekick who's not all there, and so on and so on.  I know it is unfair to compare this to Pulp Fiction because they are about different plots but this film mimics PF in style (again, sometimes to the point of nausea), but PF has some serious overtones in it.  When Jules is giving his bible speech before killing a guy in PF, you know he means it. In BS, when the brothers give a similar speech, it is almost comedic.  But the film does not seem to be a real farce stylistically (except for the funny obligatory shoulder-spread-out shot when DaFoe is talking about the ""big shoot-out"").  I don't know if it was trying to be funny or serious. And that's the big flaw the script has in my opinion.If you're tired of watching PF for the 1,000th time, watch this.  If you have not seen PF or Resovoir Dogs, catch those first.  And catch them a few more times, as repeated viewing of those is still better than BS.  But if when you have seen them a few times, then read the beginning of this paragraph. 6/10",The Boondock Saints
195,slappytheclown,Shockingly Good,10,31 March 2003,"A fantastic movie; intriguing plot crazy dialogue, diverse characters, all out fun.  I highly recommend this movie. Weaknesses?  A couple of times, the vulgarity was gratuitous.All in all, I dug it.",The Boondock Saints
196,mrsknoll,Outstanding...,10,3 February 2006,"A friend of mine told me over and over again to rent this and I procrastinated because every time I looked at the box or the title, it seemed like garbage (especially since he has really bad taste in movies). So I finally rented it and it blew me away. It's a clever film with excellent acting and great direction. I'm a fan of unusual movies and Boondock Saints is one of my new favorites. It was really a funny movie - but inappropriately funny. Kind of a dark comedy, with some really great ""action"" scenes. They are things that really shouldn't be funny, like the gay FBI agent or the cat incident (watch and you'll understand), are somehow incredibly amusing. The film is shot in a really interesting way, with no regard to time. It goes back and forth from present to past, a bit Tarantino-ish in that aspect. Willem Dafoe's character draws you in - the way he can stand at a crime scene and just know what happened. The addition of the classical music at these times really makes for a beautiful scene.I feel it's an all-around good movie that I highly recommend.",The Boondock Saints
197,daberaz,Execution prayer doesn't make it Pulp Fiction,7,26 April 2010,"Boondock Saints seems to be mixing styles of Guy Ritchie's twisted British crime stories with funny characters, some of Quentin Tarantino style dialogue and violence (although only the Unrated version is bloody) and loooots of strong language.As the language goes, I have to say that I've seen lots of movies with much higher F-word count, but there seems to be a huge difference between an F-word and an F-word. As long as ""Fu*k! Sh*t!"" bartender scenes are super funny some of Funny Man's language is just hard to listen to. But enough with that.As the movie goes, it is often compared to Pulp Fiction but the only major similarity I can find is a prayer before killing someone. Boondock Saints don't have the intelligence of Tarantino's writing at all, some dialogues are funny but non of them are that brilliantly written as Pulp Fiction's screenplay.The showing of the story reminds me of Ritchie's ""Snatch"" - I have to say it is funny to watch both what happened and how the detective thinks it did. There is some hilarious scenes on the way, like the rope one, and some that are really well directed and filmed!Willem Dafoe's acting is really good although I did not like that role that much (espiecially the ending costume part), while the rest of the cast is just good. Nothing stunning for sure.Overall, Boondock Saints is a fun movie, for adults, that seems to be a mix of various styles and a parody of some and that has some good parts but also some pretty big flaws or parts that just could have been than so much better.",The Boondock Saints
198,juanathan,I truly do not know why so many people like this,1,10 July 2005,"Let me start off by saying that I did not see the whole movie. I missed a part of the middle but the rest I watched completely. I should also say that I'm a pretty big Tarantino fan. This movie was awful in every regard. I can see people calling it a cult film for the so bad it is good reason, but calling it classic and original is miles away from the truth.You name it this film did it terribly. It was terribly directed by newcomer Troy Duffy. Every seen almost came off as comic unintentionally and inserting the religious message made this film even more bad(not that I have anything against religion). This movie is an abomination to religion. The Pope would be vomiting. This might have been one of the worst editing jobs I have ever seen. It is so annoying. I can imagine the director going "" ooh I want to be cool like Tarantino and make it time twisting."" Give me a break. The acting had nothing to offer. I found the two leads to be not very good and miscast. The scene that tries to be poetic( trust me, you will know) had a very good idea go to complete waste. The action scenes were some of the worst I have ever seen in my life. It is too painful too describe. The film arrives at one of the dumbest conclusions ever.

It's stylized without being gimmicky.  It has clever dialog and an engaging storyline.  It is disturbing and liberating all at the same time.This movie was so good that I watched it twice in two days because I had to show it to friends after watching it by myself the first time around.In short, this movie is for anyone with the constitution.

203,Dragon_Eye_Morrison,Not fun.,1,13 April 2010,"The Boondock Saints, a power trip macho-vigilante flick from 1999 has become a bit of a cult item within a very specific crowd. Why? Who knows, cult movies are not always good movies by default. Boondock is by far one of the most worthless movie that could had ever get any kind of following whatsoever. Let's skip right away the vigilante agenda going on, which goes without saying that is silly and one dimensional beyond belief. Let's even skip all the poorly made attempts of ""black humour"", which for Troy Duffy just consists of having the ""heroes"" molesting corpses of females, saying the f word a million times and using a toilet as a weapon in the most improbable way you could think of.No no no, forget all that, what it boils down to it's this: Boondock Saints is not a fun movie to watch, at all. Duffy thinks he's John Woo in his prime, and decided to shot every single shooting sequence in this mess in SLOOOOOOOOW MOTION, making it a complete bore to watch the same gimmick over and over. There's never any tension whatsoever in any of the confrontations, the ""heroes"" just blast everything and everyone without any effort. Then there's the second gimmick, Dafoe's character pretty much just telling you what happen in each scene, and then show us a flashback of said scenes, with even moooooore sloooow motion. It's like if the movie was repeating itself to just cover the fact that the plot is invisible, an insult to your intelligence, that the action is sub-par and that the whole movie has no reason to exist other than bore you to death with it's absurd fetish of violence and it's ""unique"" sense of humour.There's just so much stuff to point out, i'll just throw one more example right away: there's a scene where our two ""heroes"" and a third character are shooting each other within a very small range of distance. They never hit each other, at all, really. This is some Godfrey Ho level of silliness going on, and even Godfrey's movies can be enjoyable out of their sheer will to ham it up. BS on the other hand takes all this stuff so dead serious, this is no parody, no spoof whatsoever of the dumb clichés of the action genre. The movie is 100% sure that it has created a ""cool"" action piece, and that it's pro-vigilante/religious fanaticism message is something to be taken seriously.There's nothing to like here, not even in an ""ironic"" way. The humour is Family Guy level of comedy, the plot just a mess, and the direction the disaster i just described. It's a movie that will remain buried in the sewers of bad cinema, and for the better.",The Boondock Saints

I wish i could tell you what exactly makes this movie so great, but i would be going on forever, so i'll just stick to generalization. The atmosphere of the movie is set in Boston, a vastly cultural city with a large crime syndicate. Two Irish brothers become the victim of crime and decide to take justice into their own hands as vigilantes. The Boondock Saints isn't a rip-off of Deathwish, there is allot of back-story and social commentary with in the script to set it apart from other films of its genre. It is very unfortunate that this movie's thunder was taken away by the tragic events at Columbine, because it would have otherwise gained more recongniton then it had. Upon films end, the movie allows for the audience to review there ideals on justice and how the criminal system works.

Even though I admit it is a fairly old movie it still has its explosive charms and witty comeback lines which makes this movie one of my Friday night favorites. I have permanently added the word ""insignificunt"" into my repertoire as a result.

208,bibleboyiam,Immaturity at it's Best,3,23 February 2004,"I hadn't heard a word about this film before some of my friends mentioned how great it was and advised me to see it. So I took their advice and rented it soon after. Currently, the day after seeing it, I can think of very few qualities that made this film worth watching. It was obvious to whom this film tried to appeal, young men, ages 15-22 who think that nothing would be better than to roam the streets killing `bad guys'. Unfortunately, many of my friends fit this description. 	In general the film was overdone. It simply tried to shock the viewer with profound amounts of outlandish violence, extended periods of extreme language, and by making one of the main characters gay, in a disturbing sort of way. The inclusion of Ron Jeremy destroyed any slight credibility that the film may have strived to achieve as the mere sight of him makes me want to shoot myself in the head. It was no surprise that he was the only character in the film to engage in sexual activity (in front of the camera, as there is other sexual activity implied in the movie, e.g. Willem Dafoe's character, agent Smecker, sleeping with his flamboyant male lover) Other moments were downright embarrassing, such as when Smecker first makes an appears as the super cool FBI Agent who's intellect is, of course, far superior than that of the individuals in the Boston Homicide Unit initially investigating the murder scene. The most ridiculous part of the scene is when Smecker investigates the scene while swaying to opera music, and closes the crime within seconds. Madness. The next most ridiculous scene is the shootout between the old man who is released from prison to kill the Saints and the Saints themselves. The scene consists of the Saints, their friend Rocco, and the old man shooting at each other at point blank range for several painfully unrealistic minutes and the four men walking away from the skirmish with mere scratches. Ridiculous. 	Not only did the outlandish scenes get on my nerves, but so did the entire religious message that the movie painted. It's interesting how the Saints, being the cold blooded killers that they were, were so religious as to pray over the bodies of the men that they brutally killed. O and the prayers that they recited over and over and over were nothing but an annoyance while they were intended to be poetic and beautiful. 	Overall, this film is a waste of time for anyone who has realized that there is more to life than Metal Gear Solid and Grand Theft Auto 3.",The Boondock Saints

The action is over the top bad, the actors are over the top terrible, the story is just plain idiocy and the directing is extraordinarily lacking here. This is amateur hour at its worst. Anyone with any sense of taste in what is a good movie or bad one would know right off the bat just how horrible this movie is. IMDb doesn't allow for me to write everything I want to say about this movie, but my point here is that this movie should have never even made it to DVD. Don't waste your time or efforts with this trash unless you're curious to see how poor and terrible one movie can be. 2/10 (it gets 2 b/c there was potential for a great movie here and there is some effort in originality that was poorly executed).",The Boondock Saints

I like Willem Dafoe and he doesn't do a bad job; but my God there are a litany of unbelievable events that make this thing pretty tedious to watch. It's not the acting that is bad - it's that the plot is chocked full of gaping holes in logic. And, movies don't have to be completely logical for me to like them, but at least they should make sense within the storyline.I am curious who these people are that liked this thing. Movies like Armageddon and Godzilla have more cogent stories. Are there that many victims of lobotomies running around? I suggest if your synapses are firing normally stay away from this piece of offal.

I'll try not to spoil too much. For starters the action scenes are really well executed and the way they transition between agent Smecker analyzing the crime scene and the actual event that happened is really well done. The best part of the movie is without a doubt the chemistry the characters all have with each other. Murphy and Connor make a great team and Rocco makes for a great comedic relief character.

First off, it one of the most original movies I have ever seen. The plot is fast-paced, and the characters are unlike any I've ever seen. Each character has a life, but the movie does not go too deep into it because it does not add to the plot. Duffy seems to keep the story moving while keeping the characters in personality for every shot. Willem Dafoe's character, detective Smecker, is unlike anything I've ever seen. He is creepy yet amusing and I don't think I will ever forget his performance. Another thing that makes this movie so great is it's humor. While it is a serious subject matter, the movie has many funny scenes and lines that made me laugh out loud. The last thing that I want to put into this review to explain why this movie is great is its unique storytelling. The viewer sees the crime scene, then the crime, and then the aftermath. It keeps you interested more than other movies because it is so original. The actions scenes are amazing, well choreographed, and the viewers relates well with the characters.

Otherwise, I would have pushed the ejector switch in the first 20 minutes.All the talk about Columbine, and it being the reason this cult classic wannabe was not theatrically released is pure B.S. Although I admit the production is technically fairly well done, Boondock Saints makes even the most fatuous Hollywood offering look like Citizen Kane. Any comparison to Tarantino's work is simply a sham. Actually, what we have here is a horribly failed and misguided attempt to surpass some of the unpleasant elements found in Tarantino films.That would explain the ludicrous overuse of bullets shattering, blood splattering, and F-bomb chattering. Forget any attempt at character development, or anything approaching a coherent story. Instead we are presented with an awkward array of soggy cardboard characters that stumble through meaningless action. There is no need for resolution, no need for redemption, no need even for an ENDING. All we end up with is hope - HOPE THAT THE SEQUEL WILL NEVER BE MADE!As for Willem Dafoe, he should be grateful that this travesty was never released. His goofball performance as a creepy, campy FBI agent rivals Tim Curry in Rocky Horror.

After the movie characters - two Irish brothers - met with the same thugs at home in his apartment, and very pathetic kill them. For this they get into a prison cell and there, quote, ""One day they was enlightened: God himself had sent them to the ground on a special mission by giving the holy power to cleanse the world from evil."" So in other words, based on two adult man Hard beds in a cool jail cell and then sleep through them becomes the Almighty with the message ""soak in all the scum in the city."" There. Such a description ... Stop! I find the idea of a plot of this movie stupid? You know, after you read the description for this film, I think you should not watch the whole thing to see that the very stupid idea of this cold,rustic and too sluggish thriller from director Troy Duffy, the way other producer and founder of Miramax, ""Harvey Weinstein, which was the sole cause of the birth of this film.After the failure of the ""saints"" in movie theaters and a release on DVD in the circles of the audience this movie was mistakenly recognized as a ""cult"" and even replete with reviews in the style of the same in the spirit of Tarantino and Guy Ritchie! "". Stupid and I'll explain why. The film, for all his, as I wrote, it's silly and delusional story devoid of at least some self-irony, witty black humor (which is so characteristic of Guy Ritchie), interesting quotes to classic movies past (it just did could bring together the tape with the style of Quentin Tarantino ) and in the end at least some charm. Apparently the words ""in the style of Tarantino's"" man in the street understands only the criminal theme of the plot, and a dozen flat ""black"" jokes.More on the story ...At some point, the brothers are taking to his team a third, more ""manic"" Saint, Rocco (aka actor David Della Rocco), who gives the film a sour, sexist charge from which he would never be able to get out.Now a team of FBI interest in the saints, in particular Detective Paul Smeker (Defoe), which differs from many other detectives strange behavior. Every time he appears on the scene, where our heroes are visited by the Irish, it comes with a ""psychic"" connection and repeats all the movements performed by them on the spot. All this takes place under nice-awful ""Slow-mo, the sounds of moaning chorus of mourning and pouring the detective later.Of course, all that pathos of the shootings, and in particular the final credits may cause an ordinary viewer reflex reaction to the perception of the entire movie as a brilliant criminal fighters, and even socially important (!!!) movie that anyone over thirty will cause confusion.Troy Duffy, a properly noticed by a film critic, this man whom Tarantino would not want to become. During his career he managed to remove only two films, and even despite good sales of DVD and the status of ""cult"" producers do not want to have anything to do with him, including his friend, one of the founders of Miramax. For this film, at best, be treated as a pitiful parody of ""Hard Boiled"" in John Woo's ""deceptive"" wrapped the independent film era of the 90 Sundance Film Festival.",The Boondock Saints

221,sacha_brady,So utterly awful it's actually good,10,8 April 2017,"This film is awful--but its so awful it's good!!! It belongs in the special Battlefield Earth class of movies for its over-the-top portrayals (the only thing missing was for Smecker to wear pink and listen to ABBA), inane plot devices (mobsters killed by a lead character launching himself off a building while handcuffed to a toilet), jaw-dropping dialogue (see the what happened to my cat scene) and unapologetic aping of other films'directing styles (ex. John Woo slo-mo, Christopher Nolan orbiting camera). This film is truly amazing.",The Boondock Saints
222,Jellygoose,WoW,10,6 April 2001,"A few people recommended this movie and i noted the name but never made a big deal of it because i'd never heard of it.  Browsing through the late night movies on cable last night i noticed it was showing so decided to check it out... boy am i glad i did. Its absurdly cool, very funny and dripping violent gunplay. Two Irish-American brothers kill two russian mafia henchmen in self defence and find themselves minor celebrities amongst the locals and the police, meeting gay FBI agent Willem Defoe (in a classic role) at the same time. The brothers then find themselves with the equipment and motive to start a crusade to rid the streets of Boston of ""evil"" men.  Joined by a small time mafia ""runner"" called Rocco (looking suspiciously like a thin Mick Foley ;) )they take down mafia members and lowlifes one by one all the while being pursued by Defoe's FBI agent and hired gun ""The Duke"" (the awesome Billy Connoly). Their quest for their own brand of justice leads to many very violent scenes, but done in the kind of cool  well choreographed way of so many other modern action/criminal films, but somehow managing to seem original and outclassing them all in the cool stakes, but its hard to ignore the humor of this movie too, both in dialog and situation and the breakneck yet laid-back pace of the story (i dont know if that makes sense but it will when u see the movie).  Some of Defoe's dialog in particular and the scene with the cat, are very very funny. I guess there are points in the movie i could criticise but right now i cant think of any.  One of the best movies i have seen in a long long long time. Personally, i loved it 5/5",The Boondock Saints
223,Barry_the_Baptist,Laughable trash.,3,5 December 2003,"Troy Duffy's ""Boondock Saints"" is an execrable mess filled with atrocious editing, a terrible soundtrack and appaling performances. After seeing this film I felt compelled to go straight to confession and receive expiation for my sin in buying into the overwhelming hype surrounding this 'slick, stylish film'. Everytime Mr. Duffy faded to black needlessly, I thought about denouncing my Catholicism.

225,soporific,The best sleeper movie since The Matrix,10,4 June 2004,"Now that I've calmed down I can write the review. I tried straight after watching the film and used the word awesome about 6 times. You may have appreciated my passion but the review would have hardly been illuminating.OK, the film is awesome but I think its fair to also say it is excellent: its highly entertaining and it makes us, the audience, think (and argue about ad nauseum on IMDb). I wasn't bored for a second, more like I was paralysingly concerned for what was going to happen next. What more do you want? Like another reviewer expressed, this film gets a massive 10/10. It would have only got a seven or an eight except that there are at least two or three scenes that would be in the top 1000 scenes of all time. I tried to mark it down but found I couldn't. Nothing wrong with the script, cinematography, music score, & acting (great chemistry between the two Irish brothers). But that would still have only garnered a nine.The extra mark goes to the director for his inventive story-telling - while The Boondock Saints is linear from start to finish, throughout the film we get the information a little differently. It doesn't give anything away to say a large part of the film concerns various crime scenes. In one of them, you get the crime scene first and then you get to see what happened. Willem Dafoe plays the clever FBI agent. First we see him try to guess how the crime scene came to be and then we get to see how it happened and thus see if the FBI agent was right. Good idea and well done.But the director doesn't just leave it at that. For one of the crime scenes we get to see Dafoe's explanation as the action occurs. Really thrilling. And I haven't even mentioned the Firefight scene. Look at some other reviews for very passionate explanations of how we get to see the full acting range of the astounding Willem Dafoe.I haven't seen a film this good - that wasn't an immediate smash hit but deserved to be - since The Matrix and The Usual Suspects. It is my humble opinion that the quality of The Boondock Saints is in that sort of company.Finally the question of the moral dilemma. Can there be any justification for vigilantism? Firstly the film obviously turns around this question and then we get the excellent footage through the credits of vox pops of people on the street about what they thought of 'The Saints'. The full range seems to be included (lots of 'no comment', 'its wrong' and 'where can I sign up') and it is excellently edited with a reasonably clear narrative achieved from the hundred or so people we see in the few minutes of the credits.But I can add a quote from someone who you could more or less say was a real life example of The Saints and whose image is probably the most recognised image in the world today - Che Guevara. He is accused by some as being a murderer (he did kill quite a few people) and is also thought of by lots of Cubans as a hero. The religious of those might even say he was some sort of saint so maybe the quote might be relevant. You decide.""If you tremble with indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine.""If the system and all its laws strays too far from an easily discernible moral compass - its easy to understand the sympathy people have for 'The Saints' as witnessed in the closing credits. But we ALL have to become saints or it ain't going to work.Where can I sign up, indeed.",The Boondock Saints

228,jeanshop,This isn't the God I know,3,3 July 2018,"IMHO, this movie is just a typical hollywood excuse for violence and killing. It's almost like porno movies--just a thin plot line so as to mostly show sex. I must admit, though, that there was a bit more plot than in a porno movie.
Having said that, my main complaint is against the premise of the story--that God would have sent these men to kill off a bunch of bad guys. Folks, I know God, and I know that He doesn't go around killing sinners. Yes, He does let them reap what they sow, but He is always reaching out in love, and waiting for even the most vile of persons to turn to Him and repent, and receive His love. It is in reality Satan that is going around killing as many as he can, by taking advantage of their foolishness and sinfulness.

But nevertheless, the movie can stand on its own with lots of action scenes (I couldn't help but wanting more), humor, some great surprises, and good performances from all the actors (there were hardly any actresses in the movie!). I must say that Willem Dafoe, however, gave a very unique and exceptional performance, one like I've never seen before. This is a good movie to watch when hanging out with your friends.

It has some of the greatest characters I have ever seen, supreme slow-mo action scenes, a unique feel and sound and it doesn't take itself too seriously. I almost look up to the brothers (for killers that is). I mean who hates to see gang lords and thugs get what they deserve? It was also amazing and quite funny to see Defoe play a gay FBI agent with a low tolerance for fellow yet idiotic policemen.I watched this first at a friend's and loved it so much I bought it. I was disappointed to learn that a lot of the action scenes were chopped up, all but the language of course. Maybe the new Special Edition 2 DVD set is more original.At any rate, I suggest you ignore the nay-sayers and watch this movie.

232,hoppz,Amazing movie,10,27 September 2004,I seen this movie for the first time a couple of years ago just by chance on one of the sky movie channels and since must have seen it 100 times.The movie is well written with a lot of black humor scattered about throughout the film. It does try to take itself a little to seriously in places and forgets its a very good and clever action movie and trys to convey a moral message and ask a question about the state of the world and just how right the vengeance of boondock saints actually is. putting this to one side the movie does stir up emotions and i have to admit feeling slightly like buying several big guns and cleaning up my town every time i watch the movie. It affected me enough to get the whole of my back tattooed with an image based on the movie and I'm very proud to say the tattoo can be seen on the official movie site. The film runs in an unusual order that many people compare to Pulp Fiction however it is nothing like you simply see the crime scene before you see what actually happened to cause it this is the best feature of the movie and extremely fun watching agent Smecker trying to work out what the saints had done and who they are. An exceptional movie and well recommended.,The Boondock Saints

All mixed with cool action scenes, nice music and a really good angle of the whole event.Then the two brothers gets a ""vision from god"" that they have to kill all evil people. So, they start to do just that. And they do it very well.

While this movie could have potentially provided great jokes, beautifully artistic scenes, and cinemagraphic innovation, it falls into the category of failed Film School projects that simplistic audiences are duped into liking. Ironically enough, the cast is extremely strong and the script was absolutely wonderful. However, the director's abuse of power ruins any merit providing a few ridiculously melodramatic ""detective-recreation"" scenes by Willem DaFoe coupled with a Cliché'd depiction of our ""Hero's"" in Church and surrounded by G-dlike figures.Overall, this movie doesn't deserve the cult following it has and provides people an excuse to claim they support something artistic. Unfortunately, bad taste and art go hand in hand.",The Boondock Saints
235,hollywood2k2,This is a winner,10,23 April 2000,"""The Boondock Saints"" is probably one of the greastes sleeper hits since ""Reservoir Dogs"". Many have compared Tarantino's breakthrough hit and this film and they ""Boondock Saints"" is just as good if not better than ""Reservoir Dogs"" (and that's saying a lot because I'm a huge Tarantino fan). This has got to be one of the best crime flicks in a long time and ranks up there with ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Reservoir Dogs"", and ""The Usual Suspects"".
With the accents of the two Irish brothers it also resembled that little English hit called ""Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels"" but with a little more edge to it. Wilem DeFoe was great in and it's one of his best since ""Platoon"". Sure it was violent but it was for the sake of good.There were some obvious influences in this movie that made it fun to watch. The prayer that the two brothers recite before they shot their target is a lot like Jule's Ezekiel 25:17 from ""Pulp Fiction"". In the end this movie was just great.",The Boondock Saints

Don't get me started on flamboyant FBI character, a carricature so overused after the iconic portrayal of Norman Stansfield by Gary Oldman (and never again matched to this).

238,kiwikwi,An incoherent attempt at raising some moral questions at best,4,1 May 2005,"It's not immediately apparent what goal Troy Duffy had in mind when he wrote The Boondock Saints.In this film, we follow two Irish brothers on a mission from God to rid Earth of all evil, but the film is vague regarding the questionable righteousness of their deeds. Instead, it shows the brothers as they see themselves, as martyrs suffering torture and self-mutilation rivalling the scourging of Christ (or at least, that seems to be the idea) in their quest for holy righteousness.They also receive approval from the FBI agent assigned to their case, but in the end, it's left very much up to the viewers to decide whether the brothers are doing a good thing or not.One could suspect that that was the point of the film, but while I see no problem in a film raising such questions, The Boondock Saints hardly does that very well, with its imbecile jokes, and lack of plot and believable characters.Could it then be that Troy Duffy is merely expressing his beliefs, and genuinely wants us to sympathize with these two holier-than-you brothers and their vigilant justice? If so, it's not working at all - for me, anyway.In the end, one reach the sad conclusion that this is likely just another violent action film trying to attain depth, but failing miserably.",The Boondock Saints

Obviouly the approach was to find the right actor for the part rather than the biggest affordable name. Not that the names are small mind you. Sean Patrick Flannery and Willem Defoe are two actors I find woefully underused in main stream cinema.The subject matter poses some interesting questions. While the actions of the brothers are, in essence, illegal. are they in fact 'wrong'?

240,guido anselmi,"Tight, entertaining ""pulp movie."" A little overrrated by its fans.",6,25 January 2003,"I wouldn't be a bit suprised if ""The Boondock Saints"" had been based on a comic strip. It's made with the same tongue-in-cheek / morality tale method that befits ""Spiderman"" and ""X-Men."" The result is something similar to these movies; an exciting, technically proficient popcorn movie. It's a pulp movie, the kind you throw away a few bucks  on when you want to watch a movie without having to think too much, but you don't want your intelligence to be insulted either. What's interesting about this film is that so many people insist that it's something more. I admit that it is starkly original in it's characters. The closest relatives to the brothers i can think of are ben affleck and matt damon in dogma, which is a stretch. But this is still essentially a super hero movie. The acting is over the top, the direction is frenetic, violence is common, and the inherently mysterious qualities of the characters allow for any kind of plot twists the director wants. This is a good film by a young, excited filmmaker, but is far from a thoughtful and important reflection on vigilantism and religious fervor. It's little more than a cool action movie, but it's still a very cool action movie. Enjoy, but enjoy for what it is, and then go watch ""Taxi Driver"" or Godard's ""Breathless"" if you want to take a film seriously.By the way, I haven't read all of the reviews of this film on imdb.com, since there are over 200, but none of the one's i've read mentioned this film being withheld after the Columbine massacre. I normally don't spport anything resembling censorship, but not releasing this film was an extremely tactful move by the studio. Releasing it would have been more tasteless than Charlton Heston's NRA rally in Denver. It was as untimely as a film could possibly be and the studio made a good decision. It also was probably best the best thing for the film, since it probably would've been dismissed a lot more quickly with a traditional release and not have developed the cult following it enjoys. All the same, I'm looking forward to seeing what the Saints will be up to in the sequel.",The Boondock Saints

Yes, it is a simple concept but the director pulls if off nicely. The acting is top notch and there is enough action to keep the movie interesting. The only complaint i have as far as acting is Ron Jeremy. I think he looks funny in that role and it is hard to take him seriously.

242,psikill,Bad Mouth Film Hits The Score Ground,9,2 April 2004,"First of all, `The Boondock Saints' isn't the ideal film for sensible people, because the language and violence content of the film, is way out of hand, it even looks as if the director didn't know how to control it. So one piece of advice, only people with nerves of steel can see this one. `The Boondock Saints', a film by Troy Duffy, tells the story of two young men, who, convinced that they were ordered by a higher being, decide to do justice by their own hands. It shows how a cop ends up by doing something against his ideals.SpoilersThe story begins as Connor MacManus (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy MacManus (Norman Reedus), two Scottish lads, are attacked by a group of the Russian mafia. They beat them up, but, as all normal mafia groups do, decide to return the message. In the fight, they end up killing the Russian guys, and, consequently, are considered heroes by the press, as, according to the facts, killed them in selfdefense. The problem is, that these guys, are very fanatic in terms of religion, so, when in one night they receive some kind of message by a higher being, saying that they must kill all evil people, they embark on a violent journey, doing justice by their own hands, helped by a washed up robber Roc ""Funny Man"" (David Della Rocco), who is only in the business for, mainly money and personal revenge. The detective in charge is FBI Agent Smecker (Willem Dafoe), who, trough the entire story, tries to know who are the faces behind the crimes, and also tries to know what's their cause. When he discovers their true cause, he does something that he never thought about doing.End of SpoilersTroy Duffy has made a film full of bad mouth and curses mixed up with a lot of heavy and bloody violence. A particular technique I liked very much on Duffy's direction, was putting the process of investigation before witnessing the crimes, making the viewer `investigate' alongside Dafoe, equally ignoring what really had happened. The acting in this film is pretty good, I was surprised by the performance of Sean Patrick Flanery (as I didn't liked him very much his in `Suicide Kings`). His teammate, Norman Reedus, had a steady performance, the same goes to Willem Dafoe's interpretation of the gay detective, but the one who impressed and surprised me the most was David Della Rocco. He made me laugh and open my mouth of admiration, I wasn't expecting his performance to be so good. Best of the lot, in my opinion. The plot is very straight-forward, simple, good for the average viewer. Not very complex.Concluding, `The Boondock Saints' is a good action flick, with bits of comedy along the way and very strong language and violence. I heard there's going to be a sequel called `The Boondock Saints: All Saints Day', I just hope it's as good as its predecessor. God bless Portugal!PsIKiLL's Rating: 9/10",The Boondock Saints
243,R_MACKEN,"Cool, funny, and a very unique action movie",9,11 March 2004,"Boondock Saints is a very enjoyable movie. The acting of most of the lead characters was done very well, and the action sequences were done very good as well. I like the scene when William Dafoe character explains one of the crime scenes and while he was explaining it, the actual crime scene happened at the same time (I hope that made sense). This movie is very funny, and nearly every scene has a little bit of humor.I only had one slight problem with the movie: The Actor who played Rocco seemed to be pretty annoying at time, and it seems he over acts in some of the scenes.This movie is very fun, and it is very unique. Should it be compared to Reservoir Dogs or Pulp Fiction? No, because this movie seems to be more lightheaded, but I'm not saying its a bad movie at all.

Better than Reservoir Dogs? That's a serious review. So for my birthday he bought it for me from a local Blockbuster and that night, I watched it for the first time. And I have to say, he was right. Reservoir Dogs was great I don't deny that. But this film managed more laughs and looks of quiet awe than Reservoir Dogs.This, I think, is writer/director Troy Duffy's first big film. And I say he did a fine job. He laid the storyboard perfectly, using a lot of flashback techniques. He presented a horrifying scene at first, then he shows you how it happens. Like how it was done in Reservoir Dogs.The two main characters, played excellently by Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus, had light twangy accents from the Isles that made me think of Trainspotting. That and the fact that Sean Patrick Flannery vaguely looked like Ewan McGregor in the film. I also liked how, despite the fact that they were killers, they managed to pull it off like teenaged hooligans.I also tip my proverbial hat to Willem Dafoe for playing such an odd character, an highly-stressed, highly-intelligent, highly unorthodox homosexual FBI agent. And I also tip my hat off to David Della Rocco. He played a laughable, bumbling mafia turncoat quite well. And I loved how the Saints managed to pick on him from time to time.And the ending was definitely powerful.

At the time of this writing, y'all have seen fit to bestow upon Boondock Saints a coveted 7.7 rating and any number of rave reviews. How does this happen? Who sees this convoluted, simple minded exercise in right wing propaganda and actually buys into its half-assed morality lecture? Setting aside the moronic dialogue, hopelessly stereotyped casting and would-be John Woo action sequences, this is just a ridiculously dumbed-down portrait of vigilantism. Remember all that hubbub when Rambo came out about the U.S. soldiers ""not being allowed to win"" in Vietnam? Here the theory is that restrictive ideas like due process and fair trials are keeping our police from winning the war on crime. I disagree with that viewpoint, but I would accept a film that presented it in an intelligent, illuminating manner. Films like Taxi Driver, Falling Down and, lord help me, even Original Gangstas have tackled the subject with much more insight into the workings of the vigilante mind and better arguments for such action. I detested Straw Dogs for its philosophy of preemptive aggression over pacifism, but I still respect it for the vivid and meaningful argument it put forth. Boondock Saints simply says ""These are good guys. These are bad guys. If the good guys kill the bad guys, we will have no more bad guys,"" then uses that simple notion as a frame on which to drape a whole lot of boring shooting and cursing. If only the real world were that black and white. The director makes a weak effort to ground his work in reality with the pro and con interviews at the tail end, but the film's sympathies are never in question. Oh, and was Willem Dafoe's surprise drag appearance supposed to make me laugh? Because to me it played like sheer desperation brought on by a total lack of original ideas. Can't wait for the sequel.

250,rightwing_redcoat,Excellent!,8,12 January 2005,"This movie was one of those ones that really surprised me. I had seen it a few times in the Movie Store, but I had never bothered to rent it. One day I headed to a friend's house, and that was the movie that we were going to watch. 15 minutes into it, I had become another fan. This movie is brilliant, with some of the most original characters that I've ever seen. Il Duce, the hit-man, was one of those, with his 6 guns. Paul Smecker, the homosexual FBI Agent, was another great addition to the cast. Rocco, and of course, the McManus brothers, were a load of fun to watch as well. Another thing that I loved was the action sequences. These are very well done, and above all, original; the scene in the strip club where Rocco executes the two guys in the booths; just watch it and you'll see what I mean. This is an amazing debut for Troy Duffy. ""The Boondock Saints"" is a movie that has been slammed for its vigilantism, but the reality is that all of the guys that the brothers and Rocco kill are men that we have all, at some time or another, fantasized about doing likewise to. Despite my above praise, this is certainly not a movie for those under 15, at least. There's almost 250 f words, and the movie is pretty ultraviolet. Still, if you don't mind continuous profanity, and brutal violence, and enjoy original, hilarious action movies, this is the movie for you!",The Boondock Saints
251,titan-28,Best Movie You Never Heard Of.,10,26 October 2006,"""The Boondock Saints"" was an amazing film. I myself have never even heard of it until I had multiple people recommend it to me. It was as good as they said it was. It has a really great story line about two young Irish brothers in Boston who get into a bar fight with some Russian gangsters at a local pub. Afterwards they have a revelation and feel that they were called upon by God to clean up the city and rid them of these gangsters, thugs, pimps, etc. Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery have great chemistry with each other and excel in their roles. William Dafoe who is the detective after them, not realizing they are the ones killing all of these criminals plays an awesome character. He is very smart yet crazy at the same time. The supporting cast (which includes the infamous Ron Jeremy) are masterful in their small parts also. The filming of this movie is what I liked about it the most. Instead of showing the brothers killing everyone at the time it takes place, we are first lead to the crime scene after the fact and relive it through Dafoe's analysis. It is interesting because sometimes there will be multiple ways of showing what took place as they try and figure it out from the clues left behind. There are a lot of action moments, funny moments, and even emotional ones as this film is very well balanced. With great acting and a great script, I think many people will like this film, even if you aren't into the whole detective/gangster scene.",The Boondock Saints

few reasons. It is much better crafted than most of the movies that are being fed to the general audience these days (this is the reason why i keep watching over and over older movies instead of new ones; it seems that current producers and writers don't have any good stories to tell anymore). The message may have been presented before, but the package is more colorful, is has humour, decent action ,the story is simple but engaging. The characters are very likable, believable and quite memorable. This is what a good movie should be about : providing the beholder with a good time and good memories.

254,myuyuta,"the ultimate ""Style over substance"" movie but still...",9,21 January 2005,"Not that there's anything wrong with that... Lots of stuff in the screenplay did not quite make sense. You really have to suspend your disbelief in order to appreciate ""The Boondock Saints"". I disagree that the film glorifies violence and vigilance. It shows both sides of the coin, as I believe another viewer said. Furthermore, during the end credits, the people who thought the Saints were as bad as the criminals were just as many as the Saints' ""followers"". I really like the idea of the film. As silly, gory, and violence-driven as this flick is, it makes you think: about what kind of person you are, about whether or not you would do the same things if you got a chance, whether you approve of this type of ""justice"", etc. The cinematography was spectacular and I loved the dialogue.On to the acting now... As always, Willem Dafoe is excellent. He really shines compared to the pedestrian acting by just about everyone else. Dafoe's whole gay-bashing thing was really amusing. And I enjoy Billy Connolly everywhere I see him. Ron Jeremy... He can't act but at least I was glad he kept his clothes on this time.As a whole, I loved ""The Boondock Saints"" but I probably would have hated it if I couldn't stand violence. With a more coherent script, it would have been a 10. I give it a 9, realizing I may have been a bit too generous.",The Boondock Saints
255,ddude1116,"This is no ""Pulp Fiction""",1,17 January 2012,"I have a friend who is sort of a movie buff. Then I realized he likes action and language, and could hardly give a damn about things like cinema and film (which is a huge distinction, by the way). Well, he went on and on about this film, and the IMDb page gave it a 7.8 out of 10, so when I saw it in the bargain bin at KMart, I figured why not. Hey, it proudly boasts how fans of ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" will love it on the back cover! But comparing this film to Quentin Tarantino is an audacious display of either stupidity or sheer slander.When the film opened with the Mass I smiled, but a few minutes later when they were brawling in a bar with some Russian mobsters, I just had enough, and it was barely ten minutes in. Well, I sat through the next one hundred minutes, and noticed at almost every instance how it replaced good writing with gratuitous amounts of language and violence. Willem Dafoe was the only slight redeeming factor as a closeted-homosexual FBI agent on the trail of the Saints, but even his appeal ran thin when he had to make a moral decision of whether to aid in the boys blood-bath or capture them, like it was his job to do. If the boys had died or been caught, the ending might have satisfied me, because after all that, at least they got punished like I, the viewer, had for one-hundred-ten minutes. But no, they get out free, and the ending is about as absurd and upsetting as the entire film was before it. Not because it's insulting, no, I can handle that, but because it was legitimately bad cinema.",The Boondock Saints
256,owenmul,Style over Substance,7,27 March 2015,"This film has quite frequently been accused of being a Tarantino rip-off, while the film does quite obviously take quite a bit of inspiration from his films, it does it in a fresh way that acts more of an homage than a rip off.All of the characters this film are incredibly diverse but typical of a film this styled all of the characters a very over-the-top and manic. The craziest of this ensemble of characters is Paul Smecker (Played by Willem Dafoe), who's incredibly crime scene explorations and general antics make for an insane and quite brilliant character. The non linear crime scenes are made by his character, adding to this already incredibly interesting story mechanic.The script plays about with a non-linear story telling which works very well in this format, the crime scene investigations are done in a way which shows you the aftermath,the crime-scene, the police investigating, counting bodies, etc. After/as the police come up with theories to the crime, we see the actual scene, of the brothers going through with the crime. While some plot elements from the script are quite undeveloped and some parts feel forced and unrealistic (for example the Il Duce plot) causing the film to get a little lost at times.The cinematography is nothing too new but is quite interesting and highly stylised, which adds a new depth to the film which makes it much more interesting and so entertaining to watch.While the film is very stylised and sometimes may lose itself in this, but does provide a thoroughly entertaining experience and makes for quite an engaging film.More Reviews at: http://12yearsacinephile.tumblr.com/",The Boondock Saints

As for David del Rocco, well he must have been an investor in the film, because no sensible casting director would give him a job mowing lawns otherwise, he's about as funny as a rectal tumour.Add in dreadful direction, awful acting from the entire cast, stupid script, pathetic plot, ridiculous accents etc etc, and you have a waste of celluloid that has made me feel like disinfecting the screen I saw it on.

259,Tia-3,"Beter than Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels.",10,17 December 2000,"This movie is a masterpice of independent filmaking. This movie is set in South Boston and is about two irish brothers, (Conner and Murphy) who turn into vigalanties who kill mafia bad guys with the help of their friend Rocco, who is connected to the mob. The action in this movie is amazing, the best thing is that all the action sceens are done in flash back. Showing you the aftermath and the dectectives trying to figure out what happend. The acting is great Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus make the brothers likeable without being heavy handed and overly religious. David Della Rocco is a bit too over the top in most of his sceens. Willem Dafoe is excellent as always (will some one give this man an oscar already). My only complaint is that you can see the ending plot twist coming from a mile away, and that there is no sequel. Overall if you are a fan of action movies you will most likely love this one.

260,mjbspace,A few good elements - otherwise rubbish! 1/10,1,7 January 2000,"The good elements consists of Dafoe's wonderful acting, and some nice filmic tricks, especially the mixing of past and present. However, this is totally offset by a series of badly thought out ideas. First of all, this film states that it is correct to kill the bad guys, as long as it is done in the name of God -'turn-the-other-cheek' and 'love-your-enemy' appear to have been forgotten for this advertisement for vigilantes and the NRA. And moreover it states that it is legal to define precisely what is bad - e.g. the scene in the sex shop where two irrelevant people are shot for no apparent reason. Watching nude women behind a window (safe sex if anything?!) suddenly becomes bad also. Secondly it states that the more violent you get, the better. Especially because the film states that even the law enforcers prefers to use the old-fashioned western-style lynching methods to the judicial systems of the democratic nation of the USA. Finally, this film tries to walk the path of 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels'. It fails miserably. While 'Pulp' and 'Lock' both are quite violent, the Boondock Saint has absolutely none of the charms of its predecessors. And it lacks the stringent plot-line and brilliant manuscripts of the other two and loses its story in a pool of blood and gore. Thus it becomes boring. Too bad - it is rubbish, and deserves my first 1/10 at IMDb.",The Boondock Saints
261,antiotter,What the hell?,1,27 September 2000,"This movie was awful.  I rented it, expecting a decent gangster flick and instead got this c**p. It is a lame vigilante ""Punisher"" type flick with 2 super intelligent orphaned Irish brothers in Boston who work in a slaughterhouse who decide to take down organized crime with their super-annoying, overacting bearded friend.  Then there is Willem Dafoe, a gay FBI agent, who seems like a rejected character from ""Twin Peaks.""  He is, of course, partnered with a crusty local cop who doesn't like him, yet in the end comes to respect him. Awwww!  Gee, I've never seen that before in a bad cop movie!  His role is to flounce around and re-enact the boys' shooting sprees while swooning to opera music.  It's worse than it sounds.  And of course, the local crime families can't stop them so they get together to hire some out-of-town heavy hitter with no name & a mysterious past.  Could his mysterious past connect with the orphaned brothers???  Gee, I wonder!  Could the boys be caught at the end and the hard-working people of Boston rally around them?  Ugh.

In this one he starts out as a wise-guy cop, but as the movie progress, his dark and paranoiac behaviour surfaces, scene by scene. Great performance from him.I can't believe that this is the only movie that David Della Rocco has been in. His performance was great as 'the funny man' (and funny he was). This movie succeeds because it blends so many genres (drama, comedy, action) and does it well. The script is really good, as well.

268,imagineer99,Less than 'Saint'-ly...,5,27 July 2006,"There's nothing more frustrating than somebody who doesn't get the joke. The punchline rolls by and he's left sitting theregazing awkwardly into space struggling to figure it all out. Troy Duffy's first feature film, ""The Boondock Saints,"" rests in that type of eternal limbo. At first glance, it seems to bounce back and forth from payoff to payoff, giving the audience a good deal to chuckle about. But, as the film keeps rolling, we begin to get the feeling that ""The Boondock Saints"" is becoming choked-up by its own gag. Half-way through, the uncomfortable silence of an unrealized ruse seeps into the room. And, sadly it becomes apparent that the filmmakers don't quite get their own joke.""The Boondock Saints"" is a simplistically rendered adult-male fairytale. Whereas children relish in tales of knights and princesses, Duffy makes his Camelot a kingdom adorned with stylized hit-man and generic mafiosos. Two Irish Brothers (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) attempt to save the world from the evil and the corrupt by becoming (what else?) the embodiment of a Tarantino fanboy's fantasy. Adorned with dark sunglasses and nifty accents, the MacManus twins strut around the streets of Boston, muttering pleasing Catholic prayers in a futile attempt to somehow try to veil their inherent vacancy. Amidst all the good natured killing is a gay cop, played by Willem Dafoe with bombastic comedic zest, who is attempting to stop these vigilantes with hearts of gold. Dafoe's charactereasily the most charismatic of the bunchis a walking, talking caricature. He smiles and slaps around his compatriots, all the while flicking his bouffant into the air like a swimsuit model leaving the ocean.This is all not to say that ""The Boondock Saints"" is a complete failure. Sure, it's over-the-top, but at least there are plenty of gun shootouts and interesting carnage to keep the ball rolling. The slightly non-linear story is managed well. As Dafoe handles one crime scene, we get to see the whole shindig played out in real-time. It's a slow-motion gunfighter's dream! Bodies fall and bullets soar as Dafoe reenacts the entire massacre with emphatic precision.The true problem with the film is that it is so engrossed in its own mythos, that it actually takes itself seriously. This becomes apparent as haunting cathedral choir musical adorns the madness with Gothic foreboding. All the while, we're shaking our head wondering why Duffy isn't capable of accepting the ridiculousness of his own creation. Heck, even porn star Ron Jeremy enters the fray, but the movie doesn't pause to giggleinstead it continuously plugs along with repetitive and ruthless abandon. It seems that Duffy actually believes that not only is what the MacManus brothers doing rightbut that it is actually possible. In that sense, ""The Boondock Saints"" is like the elephant in the roomthe dinner party guess who fails to get the big joke. And, not surprisingly, the audience isn't laughing.",The Boondock Saints

Troy Duffey did an amazing job of incorporating great action scenes, wonderful characters, and a fun, easy to follow plot. Not only did the director triumph in his role, but Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flannery more than succeeded in getting the audience to fall in love with their characters within the first 5 minutes of the movie. As well as having two ridiculously endearing protagonists, the film also featured two supporting actors, William Dafoe and David Della Rocco, who were incredibly eccentric, original, and an absolute joy to watch.

It has a pretty high rating on this website and the story could have been absolute gold in the hands of Tarantino, Ritchie or even Scorcese, but to be honest I found the execution to be fairly mediocre- which I attribute to poor directing. The dialogue is quite uninspired, but I suppose all in all it's solid (the odd good line), however the narrative struggles quite a lot. In fact I, someone who watches this type of movie an awful lot, didn't really know where it was going for the first 25 minutes (but then I don't think the director did either)! 'The Boondock Saints' borrows heavily from the styles of Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, and this alone isn't a bad thing. What is a shame is that it often feels borrowed, a bit like it was thought up by a 16 year old A-level student who just saw Pulp Fiction and Lock Stock for the first time. I chuckled two or three times during the movie but on the whole the stuff that was meant to induce laughter was just stupid (i.e. Willem Dafoe's character's oddities).I guess 7/10 is fairly generous, but the idea of this film is fundamentally good- it brings up lots of interesting ideas and the potential for some good scenes. Sadly, the director's attempts at unique style aren't successful. The good cinematography often feels like a copy, and the unique stuff is generally stilted and doesn't add to the movie. But as I opened by saying, in the right hands this movie could have been 9/10 and awesome.

While parody usually takes an over-the-top approach--think Naked Gun, nearly anything with Charlie Sheen--that eliminates any question of purpose, this movie was produced with a much more subtle touch. Watching it, you might be lulled into thinking it's a serious take on the vigilante movie. When the closing credits start to roll, it finally hits you--you just sat through 100 minutes of perfectly scripted commentary on the ridiculous nature of such movies. While some directors would have been more direct--you could almost picture those two-of-the-same MacManus twins picking lice off each other like a couple of monkeys--this guy kept the story below the surface.",The Boondock Saints

I'm sorry I made the effort.  Tip to Duffy: Tarantino excelled in ripping-off dozens of films by twisting them into new, more exciting cinema - you, on the other hand, have ripped-off Tarantino, ""The Professional"" and ""Things to do in Denver When You're Dead""...and very, very, very badly.

But by the time it reached it conclusion, I found myself agitated, not paying attention, not caring.I see the major problem as being not enough character development; I didn't feel anything toward the title Irish vigilante brothers whose parts in the film flipped between merciless killer to God-serving Angel of Death with little to no transition (and little and mainly ambigious background on them).  And the manner in which Willem Defoe's character ""converts"" from FBI detective to vigilante is ludicrous and stupid.

274,mikeysazulita,Cannot understand the hype,1,29 December 2003,"I heard nothing but rave reviews for this movie.  One of my best friends stared at me incredulously when he heard that I had never seen ""The Boondock Saints.""  Apparently, it's reached cult status.  Well, with all the hype surrounding the movie, I reserved it on Netflix.com and I couldn't wait to receive it in the mail.  Last night, I watched it with a friend.  Ten minutes into the movie, I was so disappointed I wanted to turn it off. But I held in there for the full duration of the movie just so I could write a review about it today.Well, here's the premise: two Irish Catholic brothers in South Boston, on an apparent mission from GOD, start killing members of a Russian mafia.  Willem Dafoe, a clever FBI agent, is sent in to investigate but ends up admiring the brothers.  Written and directed by any other person, this story would have been incredible.  Instead, in the hands of Troy Duffy, the story was reduced to the level of a made-for-TV movie.  All the stars in the film overracted.  Yes, unfortunately, even Willem Dafoe.  The most blatant overacting, however, was done by Rocco, the ""funny man"" mobster.  He wasn't very funny, though he told one racist joke that drew a chuckle out of me. 
Besides the overacting, there were horrible cliches I couldn't stomach.  For example, Willem Dafoe is a gay FBI agent.  This was milked for laughs several times during the movie.  At one point, he calls his lover a ""fag"" and the bartender at a gay bar a ""fairy"".  Why this was included in the movie is beyond me, especially the scene in the gay bar.  It just didn't fit, but I guess the director found all of this comedic.  Another cliche was the old Irish bartender with Tourette's Syndrome.  In the beginning of the movie, he curses infront of nuns in a hospital.  Yeah, I know, could it get any worst?  I could not stomach this movie.  The comedy was less than mediocre, the story was underdeveloped, the acting was terrible, and the cliches gave me a headache.  I cannot understand the appeal of a movie like this.  Very poor work by Troy Duffy.",The Boondock Saints
275,iDontSleep-iDream,"Find It, See It",8,8 July 2007,"I truly enjoyed this movie, though I thought I wouldn't. My friend made me watch it and I am so glad she did. The story of the two brothers never stops feeling connected, no matter how much blood is shed, the result being a good mixture of anger, violence, humor and a strong bond.The humor in the movie is as funny as the action is packed. The movie follows two brothers in New York who decide after spending a night in jail that they have a mission to rid the city of it's evil, ie, the crime lords. They do this in an entertaining and violent manner. I must admit, their friend bothers me, but he does have some of the funniest lines in the movie, so I forgive him. Close behind the brothers is an outwardly gay cop whose antics are halfway between genius and loony, though they honestly seem a cross between the two. At one point, he directs a symphony at a crime scene to show how it could have gone down.In the end, the message in the film is a good, though-provoking one. Should citizens be allowed to take law in their own hand, even if it is in an effective way? See the movie for the creativity, see the movie for the acting, see it for the action or the plot.

Gun fights, visions, glorious music and cop-villain drama plays out in a surreal and often darkly hilarious world. Imagine Tarantino crossed with David Lynch. For those with eclectic tastes this is a must see. Willem Defoe deserves an Oscar for his role. It raises important moral questions on the issue of using violence to fight violence. But you will be loving the action too much to worry about that thorny issue for long. The musical combination of Catholic psalms and excerpts from opera (La Boheme) is sublime. It is quite simply a brilliant tour-de-force of movie making. Go see it! Now!",The Boondock Saints
277,fusegirltje,Boondock Saints review,10,16 December 2002,this is by far the best movie i have ever seen! from the beginning until the end it is so excellent. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus are awesome as the two brothers who decide to kill all the bad guys. i especially love how they say their prayer before they kill them. and the ending is just perfect. their speech in the court house was oh-my-god good. it's a movie you just have to see! perfect 10!!,The Boondock Saints
278,pforpoed,Cat killing ruined it ... and the Tarantino ripoffs,5,2 December 2010,"By 1999, the Tarantino ripoffs were in full swing. This is a movie by a filmmaker who knows a particular style and sticks to it without really bringing anything fresh to the party. If you don't know the premise, go read it on the IMDb page. Suffice to say, the performance by Willem Dafoe as a homosexual Federal investigator is one of the films saving graces. A rather shocking and brutal moment when a cat is accidentally killed (nay, splattered against a wall) was the point where I almost turned this film off. I wish I had. What started out as an interesting premise turned into a rather plodding hike to its somewhat clichéd conclusion.",The Boondock Saints
279,mikenike8835,Why such opposition,6,19 February 2011,"I just watched this movie for the first time and while it was not anything spectacular i found it to be entertaining. Yes almost all the action scenes were completely outrageous and unrealistic but that is hardly something to be appalled at. How many times did you say ""Oh Come on!"" when watching John McClain kill bad guy after bad guy non stop with one gun and limited ammo, or Rambo slaying entire armies single handed, and how about Dutch being the only one of many to kill the predator with makeshift weapons while covered in mud. What pure action film isn't ridiculous and unbelievable. What surprises me is the hate offered by people who disliked the movie. Take the people who write the good reviews. They say what they thought of the movie and for the most part leave it at that. But the people who write the bad reviews not only trash the movie but deem anyone who liked it childish or just plain idiots. Personally i find it childish and idiotic that these are things such people are so bothered with. Look, its by no means a great movie. But if you want to see some Irish boys defy all odds and kill endless hoards of gangsters while saying the lords prayer, then this movie is for you.",The Boondock Saints
280,panik65,An abysmally stupid film,1,14 August 2007,"Capsule review: Think Dirty Harry or Death Wish as vomited up on the screen by formerly molested altar boy who has just seen Pulp Fiction.It's an ""angry white dude"" vigilante movie for the oi/fascist/skinhead crowd, since Dirty Harry just isn't cool anymore, Clint Eastwood's too old, Charles Bronson doesn't have enough tattoos, and well, Rambo's too establishment. I was not bothered by the ""ridiculousness"" of the movie, nor the poor production quality. It's just stupid and offensive, that's all. How do you make catholicism hip? I know! have them kill people while reciting their prayers in Latin! Yeah, that's it! Catholicism's now part of the hip, sadistic, Tarantino-fueled counterculture!On some level the movie is at times enjoyable, but it's so stupid and reactionary. Psychopathic reactionaries like Troy Duffy seem to have hit the ""hip jackpot"" of blood, guns, snuff & torture scenes, heavily choreographed ""slow mo"" shootouts and fake, ""snappy"" dialog replete with obscure pop culture references ... it really seems to have a never ending appeal with the troglodyte population of the USA.Sorry, there's just no way to make Christianity ""hip,"" not all the snuff gore in the world will do that.(it's already been tried)",The Boondock Saints

I found it very unrealistic (the roof plunge, church/mass scene, courthouse/courtroom scene), over-acted (Stecker's meltdown at the crimescene going unreported), and poorly dialogued (had to have beat the record set by Casino for f-bombs). Willem Dafoe must have owed someone big-time to take this role, and the scene of him tonguing the mobster turned my stomach. The best actor is the mobster who acts like he thinks Dafoe-in-drag is a woman. Not since John Amos talking of the beauty of Esther Rolle has a man acted so well......",The Boondock Saints

That was my first mistake!I truly can't put into words how disappointed I was in this movie.  I went into it expecting some fresh exciting crime film with good acting and directing.  I was let down in all of these areas!  Especially in the acting degree where, in my opinion, Dafoe gives his worst performance that I've seen to date.  The story itself I thought was done very poorly as well.  I mean the concept of the story, I still believe, is a good idea BUT this film shows just how badly a good story can be ruined! but that's about as much time and effort I'm going to give this waste of film...at least until Troy Duffy apoloizes for putting me through his version of a movie!",The Boondock Saints
287,andrebortolon,The idiot saints or thanks Mr. Ebert!,4,14 March 2013,"No wonder the unknown Mr. Duffy made a big deal with a major Hollywood producer to shoot and direct ""The Boondock Saints""; and no wonder Hoolywood is very fond of brainless stories, which drawn the attention of most of the public, that is not only Hollywood, but it is worldwide. I've just watched the movie this week, but I'd heard some good comments about it since its release. Except for, of course, Mr. Roger Ebert, who doesn't need any presentations here. I admit I've always been a fan of Ebert's work, apart from his preferences and mine, which are different, as it is with any other individual. But he was amazingly fair, sincere and clear in his opinion about this one. I can't even figure out what to say... well... let's try a little bit, to give just an idea of what the plot is: two Irish descendants, living in Boston, they have a ""call of duty"" from their catholic saints, and in his prayers, they ask for protection to do their jobs, in name of the Lord. Their job is to extinguish all the gangs of Boston (which has a bunch of criminals, by the way)using his techniques, like to speak fluently all the languages of the existing gangs and plus, to kill'em all with no mercy. Oh, there is also the smartest ass chief of investigations, who is aware and supports the two of them in this divine mission. It's a pity to see a good actor as Willem Dafoe, doing such a pathetic character as in this movie, maybe except for the scene in which he is disguised - perhaps the only interesting moment in the movie - but that's it, there's nothing more to say. No wonder Mr. Duffy only directed a sequel ten years after... his creativity is not his strongest point, I guess.",The Boondock Saints

The dialoge was crap, the acting wasn't very good, this ""Rocco"" was the most annoying caracter I ever saw in a movie, the story and the gay cop were so cliché,...The only reason I laughed a few times was because it was so bad.

290,Animsteve,A Question of Right and Wrong,10,17 September 2002,"When my friends popped this movie into the good old DVD player, I didn't really expect very much from it. It turned out that i was about to be very pleased. Boondock Saints was by far one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. This movie isn't one that you say, ""Yeah that was a good one"" to and then forget about it, this movie will stay in your mind. The main point of the film itself is whether or not it is right to just kill those who have most definitely committed numerous crimes, or to let the law take care of them. The McManus brothers feel that the law of man is not dealing with criminals appropriately, so they decide that they will begin, as they see it, a mission of God. I believe that many people have probably wished at one time or another that someone could just do away with the scum of our world, instead of leaving to the lengthy processes of law that do not always work out. Is this right or is this wrong? That is for the viewer to decide because what is legally right is not always morally right to many. By the time the movie has ended, your position on this issue may change, or maybe it will stay the same. Either way, this film is filled with top-notch acting and directing, plus it has a dynamite story line. All I can ask is, when is Boondock Saints 2 going to arrive?",The Boondock Saints
291,gkd105,My favorite film,9,7 May 2003,"Well it's time that I commented on BDS, seeing as its my favorite film of all time. I definitely don't think that it's the highest quality film of all time, but to me, it was definitely the most entertaining. I've probably seen this movie about 20 times, and I love watching it with people who have never seen it, simply for the expressions on their faces. Rocco's lines in this movie just slay me.... he's such a great character... too bad he's not even an actor... just a friend that Duffy put into his movie. Anyways, I also love the action. It's over the top, sure, but it's just badass. I think I like this movie so much because its got a big ""F*ck off"" attitude to it. I only had a couple of problems with it, both of which occurred at the end.
*Spoilers*I hated the fact that Smecker dressed like a woman to gain access to the mansion at the end. It seemed really out of place to me and awkward. I thought that a different means of covert infiltration would have been more enjoyable. Secondly, it seems to me that the most is rushed when he boys are about to break into the mansion and in the next screen they're tied up int the chairs. I would have liked to have seen what exactly happened.Overall, the film has a great mood, great setting, entertaining characters, etc. Some of the criticisms i read bother me. Like when people have said that Il Duce was like Hannibal Lecter? give me a break. Just because a man is detained with ultra-high security doesn't mean you can compare him to a totally different type of character, Lecter, who's characterization was the fact that he was brilliant, not the fact that he was a criminal. This guy isnt brilliant, he's just a killer. Big difference.Buy the DVD; its only $10 at best buy. Hopefully the sequel will be close to as good as the original.",The Boondock Saints
292,bulldawg8110,Outrageously Overrated,4,26 June 2006,"I'd say over half of the people I know say this is their absolute favorite movie. However, every one of those people I know who say it's their favorite movie aren't big movie-watchers. They like movies for mindless action, or stupid comedy, or cheap scares. I've noticed most reviewers who dislike this film have problems with the morality of this movie. I think movies are movies, and immorality is a part of life, so I think it should be shown in movies. However, this movie has a huge list of other problems that make it virtually unwatchable to the knowledgeable movie-watcher.Now, there's nothing wrong with just watching movies for mindless action and such, because if it entertains you, then it serves its purpose. But as someone who appreciates the artistic aspects of movies, I have to review it in that manner. This movie has horrendously cartoonish acting by basically all of the people with smaller roles. It is riddled with generic, stereotypical portrayals. Now, if this movie didn't take itself so seriously, that would be perfectly fine. Unfortunately, this is a low-budget movie trying to be an epic Hollywood masterpiece, and it really shows. In taking itself so seriously, it falls desperately short of what it's trying to accomplish. The plot is just a formality in this movie. You can tell it only has a plot because it has to. They seem rather disinterested in the scenes involving character development.I felt sad for Willem Dafoe. He's a great actor, but here he is in this role he doesn't seem to fit at all. He gives the best performance of anyone in the movie, but even he fails to be believable. I wasn't sure what he was doing in this mess the entire time I was watching it. The two lead actors, Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus, serve their purpose well enough. You can tell their goal was to just not mess up, they weren't really interested in delivering powerful performances. They manage to not be laughably bad, but are far from good. However, by the end of the film, how can you care about the characters? The movie expects you to be on the side of these terribly boring, uncharismatic characters. You can't have an emotional finish without any form of emotional scenes in the earlier stages.Finally, notice how this movie is the director's only one. He's no ace director, and the comparisons to Tarantino are disgusting. Even if you like this movie, how can you think it's made in any way like a Tarantino film? The backbone of Tarantino's films and what makes them so great is the consistent brilliant dialogue. Not only does The Boondock Saints not have any brilliant dialogue, it isn't even trying to be big on dialogue to begin with. To compare Duffy to Tarantino isn't even fair, considering Tarantino has consistently made incredibly brilliant films, and Duffy has just made one cult hit that in my opinion is extraordinarily poor. This movie is certainly for those who just watch movies for entertainment. If you are looking for depth, stay far away.",The Boondock Saints

AWESOME! THE BEST!"" You will proclaim this loudly to your friends between swigs of Natural Ice and bong rips, in your Cheeto-dust covered apartment.(Coincidentally this same demographic has no idea what the film Idiocracy is about) 2) You will realize that this film's popularity is proof that war, starvation and economic inequality are inevitable.

And at the same time they will do whatever they feel is necessary to eliminate the bad in the world. But that isn't what makes this movie a masterpiece. The two brothers and their friend, Rocco (which also is his real name by the way), have something we all want, deep care for each other and loyalty, and nothing can come between that bond, and that's the part I think makes this movie a top 10 for all fans. The story isn't just about killing bad guys, like we seen a hundred times before, and ends with that, it has a lot of comedy, intensity and true action as well. This movie earned my high rating because of the characters and their stories most of all, but the story of the movie itself adds to it, that's for sure.Yes, my bad English is obvious in my reviews, and the spoilers, but it is what it is.

The story of two Irish brothers who start to free Boston from human waste (e.g. Russian gangsters, Italian pimps and contract killers) is surprisingly well written. Camera and editing is superb. But most of all ""The Boondock Saints"" lives from its characters. ""Young Indiana Jones"" Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as Irish brothers are overwhelming and Willem Dafoe delivers his best performance since ""Platoon"".

300,rjrozen,All those people died for this?,4,18 September 2006,"While going to film school, writer/director Troy Duffy apparently missed the class where they discussed motivation. Of the four main characters in this film (the MacManus brothers, Smecker, and Rocco), only one (Rocco) has any discernible motivation for what he ends up doing in the movie. It could be argued that the brothers are motivated by the sermon at the very beginning of the movie, where the priest intones against good men who are indifferent to evil (and they only hear the beginning of it). If that's the case, however, the brothers would have killed the Russian mobsters during the bar fight, rather than just setting Ivan's pants on fire. And they didn't kill Ivan and his buddy in the alley because they were out to rid the world of evil, they killed them in self-defense. As for Smecker, god only knows why he ends up wanting to help the brothers and their vigilantism. Bad day at the hairdressers, maybe? Defoe's performance can only be described in one word: mannered. It is not easy to portray a character whose major personality trait is flamboyance, and Defoe just doesn't convince us that he's doing anything else but playing the role of an eccentric, self-loathing homosexual. At times, he verges on a parody of himself. Flanery and Reedus, for their parts, are about as two-dimensional as their characters.Duffy not only needs to learn about motivation, he needs help with plotting. For instance, the Russian mob leader tells someone who he thinks is Ivan about the big gangland meeting. The only problem is that Ivan's murder has been in every paper and news program in Boston -- it's the biggest story in town (that's why all those reporters are asking about the case when Smecker is interviewing the brothers). So, what's wrong with this guy? If he's such a great gang leader, why can't he pick up a newspaper? Who does he expect to show up after he invites a dead guy to his meeting? His stunt double? I suppose a couple of meat packers become expert assassins (that's never explained) because they picked up a few lessons from dad, but how do they go from killing nine guys with ten shots to exchanging hundreds of rounds with ""il Duce"" and missing him entirely? Furthermore, why exactly is ""il Duce"" such a feared hit-man when he can only wing three guys while unloading six handguns? It looks like he's only a danger to himself. And why is an Irishman (with a Scottish brogue) called ""il Duce"" anyway? In short, weak characterizations, hammy acting, unbelievable plot holes, a morally indefensible message -- there's a lot not to like about this film. One of the few redeeming features is that Ron Jeremy, for the most part, keeps his pants on throughout the movie.",The Boondock Saints

The distraction is constant and you can't work, sleep or make love to your spouse.In desperation you seek out a therapist to find answers to the questions that plague you: How did this film get made?

Who makes that kind of orangey fake blood, and why do they still use it when it looks so false? Have I seen acting this poor since our high school production of Grease?

Why don't directors tell the actors to stop moving their eyes after they've been killed? Is it really true that all evil people in the world are bald, tall and weigh 300 pounds? Has Billy Connolly ever been worse than this? OK, accepting that he has - because even Connolly's huge ego must remember his string of dire performances in such things as Timeline, Beverly Hills Ninja and The Man Who Sued God - will he now go back to supplementing the Connolly millions only through stand-up comedy, which he does exceptionally well, and give a real actor a chance to make a few shillings in the acting world? Or is Connolly committed to raking in the shekels no matter how dishonestly earned?I could spend time critiquing this film's dubious and infantile morality, the hokum posited as philosophy, the poor writing, the self-indulgent, careless and flabby directing, the 'by-the-numbers' acting, the terrible Irish accents ('to be sure, to be sure ... ah begorrah!') and the immature plot, but I won't because it's already been done in numerous other reviews on this site. This film is poor. Very poor. To get sucked in and carried along by this storyline you don't so much need a suspension of disbelief as a full lobotomy, and the Director is shameless about reminding you of that every few minutes because he really is an arrogant man who genuinely believes you're far too dumb to notice.In conclusion, here's the main question: How exercised about a film do you need to be to go and write a review about it? For most people, I think the answer is 'pretty gol'darned exercised'. For the majority of us with bars to visit, drinks to drink, lives to live and no interest in the hobby of review writing, we either need to really love, or really hate, a movie before we can be motivated to share that love or vent that spleen.This movie has 800+ reviews on IMDb alone. To put that in context, major movies like Godfather II with 500+ reviews, The Good the Bad and the Ugly (540+), One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (500+), Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (680+) and Goodfellas (750+) are all lagging waaaay behind this gem!! I believe that you, as a potential viewer, need to ask yourself why that is. And when you go on to check those reviews you'll notice with a start that a lot of them exist purely because their writers needed to vent their spleen. Look at mine ... I don't normally write reviews but felt I had to do something cathartic to try and rid myself of the noxious residue left by this pestilential offering.And now I feel cleansed. It worked! The therapist was right.",The Boondock Saints

Connor and Murphy are two Irish brothers fed up with the filth and injustice that is taking over the world, so they decide to take it into there own hands. Perfectly cast, with Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery as the Macmanus brothers bring a real heart and conviction to the at sometimes shocking story. David Della Rocco is amazingly brilliant by basically playing himself, and another (as always) shining performance from Willem Defoe as Detective Smecker. Writer / Director Troy Duffy has managed to create a world where criminals are the ones in fear and the good men rise above. I recommend The Boondock Saints to everyone, only to make you own assumptions on not only the movie itself, but on whether or not you be on there side.",The Boondock Saints

Its full of classic lines and great humor.This is a film for people who like violent action films with great wit (Like Pulp Fiction). It also has a terrific performance from William Dafoe.

There are some moments which could have been truly iconic, and the main characters are well drawn.The casting is pretty horrible, with the exception of Willaim Defoe. Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus do acceptable jobs of the leads, but some of the other casting decisions are very suspect.The directing style derives obviously from John Woo and Quentin Tarantino, and with some John Carpenter flourishes thrown in. Any of the three directors mentioned could have done a hugely better film.I can't help but think that in 10 or 20 years time this movie will be remade and like Oceans 11 will be much better for being remade.",The Boondock Saints

311,bookworm1317,An intense movie,9,1 March 2007,"I would be the first to tell anyone that I despise so called ""shoot 'em up movies."" This movie certainly fits that description, but there is so much behind the violence and the obscenities. Firstly, Willem Dafoe is an amazing actor. He portrays a brilliant gay FBI agent who listens to classical music to aid him in his crime-stopping endeavors and ends up with a moral dilemma: he believes the Macmanus brothers are doing the right thing by killing off the scum of society, but he feels obligated to do his job and bring the killers to justice. He ultimately decides to not only not turn them in, but to assist them in their efforts. Dafoe delivers what is in my opinion the best line in the movie when he throws up his arms and yells ""There was a Firefight!"" Secondly, it was absolutely brilliant to have Dafoe explaining the crime the Macmanus brothers committed as the audience is seeing it for the first time. This is a marvelous technique which is also used in Ghost Ship to great effect, but that is another review. Lastly, this movie grapples with very interesting issues prevalent in our society today. If someone in Boston or New York was killing off pimps and mobsters, would you have a problem with that? I know I wouldn't. Overall, The Boondock Saints is an extremely thought provoking and well done movie.",The Boondock Saints

313,camillusdsl,"If you're Oirish, come into the parlor",1,1 December 2009,"Normally any movie with a good score on IMDb is worth watching, so I sat down to enjoy ""The Boondock Saints"" expecting enjoyable action. The first thing that made me worry was the opening scene, which is set in what is presumably a Roman Catholic Church. There was obviously no effort whatsoever made to ensure that the service was accurately portrayed (for example -the Lord's Prayer which is recited was not the Catholic version, but the reformist ""Protestant"" one, which is never used in a Roman Catholic service). If filmmakers decide to set a plot in any particular geographical location or ethnic community they should show at least enough respect to get the basics right. This on its own is a minor point but it was only the beginning and should have warned me about what was to come. It seems that the only reason that the main characters are Irish is to fulfil the necessary religious link needed by the movie title, by using the stereotypical off-the-shelf Irish Catholic, hard drinking, hard fighting but with a heart of gold model. It would have been far better to have done without the painful attempts at an ""Oirish"" accent which were amongst the worst since ""Finian's Rainbow"" and painful to an Irish ear. (If you want to see how it is possible for non-Irish actors to get the accent perfect watch ""The Proposition"".) All of these faults aside the movie could still have been entertaining. Unfortunately the plot is so weak and predictable that not even an actor of the quality of Willem Dafoe could save it. I had to struggle with the desire to switch this movie off after the first twenty minutes, something I almost never do. There are a lot of movies in this genre and my advice is to pick a different one – especially if you're Irish.",The Boondock Saints
314,siglo_xx,Not very good at all,3,29 May 2004,"Checking another major site the reviews (not written) aren't very good (barely over 2 stars). I saw a 7.7 average on IMDb, which I've always trusted as a reasonably accurate site. How this movie got the votes it received I have yet to figure out. It's not the movie the IMDb voting would have you believe. Acting isn't that great, plot is ridiculously filled with Hollywood hype and it's not very likely anything like this would ever happen in our lifetime. Aside from that there are technical flaws that are so far beyond belief, it leads me to believe a few amateurs were behind the scenes in fitting the story to the director's vision. Mechanical ductwork from elevator shafts leading above an occupied hotel room? Get real. Isn't reality in any sense of the word. Ductwork other than exhaust ducts from the top of elevator shafts do not penetrate elevators, and no ductwork I know of can support the weight of two men inside of it, let alone be large enough to fit two men, but I guess that's how the two stars dropped into the ceiling of the room and killed 9 people. Hollywood really needs to drop the duct technique for sneaking around buildings. It's utterly ridiculous (ever notice how clean these ducts are?) and laughable at best. Totally unbelievable and trite Hollywood movie with little to redeem itself. I'm a huge movie fan, have rated over 3300 movies on other sites and have seen them all, plus more.

318,jtho116,I bet you're wondering why no one has heard of this movie...,8,5 January 2003,"I was wondering the same thing when I first heard the title. I like to consider my self a fairly knowledgeable movie goer and was shocked when i saw The Boondock Saints because I had never heard of it and it was so good. I thought of possible reasons of why the film had never been heard of and the first thing that came to mind was that it was a box office flop. I had trouble believing this because i enjoyed it so much, but I checked on it anyway. It turns out that The Boon Dock Saints was released only a few months after the Columbine school shooting. Unfortuneatly for the people behind it's making, it did end up flopping becasue no one wanted to watch a movie about people judging evil and taking action against it in their own hands.Although the movie title sounds religious and the brothers to get their orders from God, most of the religious references are very subtle. For example: toward the end Rocco looses a finger in a gun fight. After he is captured, the matching finger on his opposite hand his shot off as a form of torture. He is swetty and terrified at the time and he has long, brown, unkempt hair. His appearence and the fact that he has matching wounds on both his hands make him seem a lot like Jesus.  Shortly after he looses his second finger, he is shot and killed. The two borthers feel guilty for this becasue they are the reason he was killed...almost like he was dying for their sins. The movie is filled with other small biblical references like this one. I recommend seeing this and I hope you all enjoy.",The Boondock Saints
319,Spudofgun,Brilliant beyond belief.,7,18 October 2003,"I first saw this film on sky and loved it immediately, the way it was acted, the script and action sequences brilliant, and filmed in a different chronological order that i do not believe was ripped off from other films. I thought it was ingenious how you would get the climax to and action sequence and then cut straight to after the event, and how it was revealed only through Willem Dafoe. I also thought this film was hilarious as well as intense, the way Dafoe plays against his stereotype as being gay is pure class. I know there are people who don't like this film, but to them i either say open your mind, or go back to your Van Damme. Don't get me wrong, i like the occasional lets go kill some people shwarznegger type films, but it's films like these that really grab me. I feel that the contrasting of the two different views at the end was a great way to end it. I rate this film right up there with American History X and Shawshank Redemption. To finish off, i am a film student, but i loved this film even before i became one. Unfortunately, none of my friends have ever heard of this film, so i am gradually forcing them to watch it, and most of them like it as well.",The Boondock Saints

I had heard the name mentioned a couple times in high school but never had the opportunity to watch it. Then finally a buddy of mine down the hall on the same floor of my dorm gave me the DVD and told me to watch it when I got bored. Its got everything I look for in a good movie, I'm typically into some kind of Action movie such as martial arts of shoot-em up genres. But at the same time don't mind a good drama, and Comic relief is a MUST. Boondock Saint covered almost everything I could want in a top 5 Film. I think that Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus did excellent as the main characters and Willem Dafoe's Character is brilliant. I instantly fell in love, Its got incredible acting, good character development, an amazing message, and the ending will have the hair on your arms standing up first time you watch it.I'm by no stretch of the imagination a film critic but I have been wanting to write Reviews for some of my Favorite movies, and I've been known to write a review or 2 for movies that I was Highly disappointed in.",The Boondock Saints

Basically this is a cheap film, it looks like it was made with the same budget as straight to TV drama, but that's where the similarities end. Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flannery play two Irish brothers who turn vigilantes to rid Boston of street scum and gangsters, yes they have the worst Irish accents since Darby O 'Gill but they work well together and add a believable stupidity and at times a very funny side to this dark film. The pearl of this movie is Willem Defoe, he absolutely steals the show and gives it that something extra  His performance is simply brilliant, his character is a sharp witted F.B.I will have you memorised by his sheer magnetism. There are times when his delivery of lines will have you splitting with laughter, especially when he's giving his fellow agents some samples of his sarcasm.This humour backed up with a very strange supporting cast that includes Comedian Billy Connolly, Ron Jeremy and the excellent Davis Della Rocco which adds up to one of the most entertaining films I've seen in ages.

322,Holocinema,Natural Born Killers with a moral,9,21 May 2004,"This tale of two Irish Brothers that decide to make justice the good old fashion way (blowing the enemy away) is a really good surprise. The script is nicely written, it features Willem Dafoe as the cop that arrives at the place where every massacre by the Boondock Saint's took place. And he tries to understand what happened and the spectator follows him as we are shown what happened as Dafoe speaks. Like in Natural Born Killers by Oliver Stone, the killers become popular by the media, but they're different from Mickey and Mallory and their random acts of violence since they mainly attack the mafia (the bad guys and not just anyone). It's nice to see a movie that provides a ""fun"" and effective solution against organized crime. It's an impressive debut for Director Troy Duffy, it's original, entertaining and well developed.

They looked really cool. The introduction period to the brothers was quite short and first it took time to get in the story but when it started rolling it was perfect.

326,maxwellsmart,By the numbers vigilante movie with religious element SOME SPOILERS,6,31 July 2005,"Boondock Saints has become a cult phenomenon, gathering a surprisingly large and ardent following despite being maligned by multiple problems with the studio system and being filmed on a reduced budget and released independently. While this is an impressive accomplishment, it remains mysterious as to why the film became so popular. It's a by the numbers B movie vigilante flick with a pretentious and underdeveloped religious aspect tacked on.The movie begins by introducing Conor and Murphy MacManus, a pair of fraternal Irish twins living in Boston who work in a meat packing plant and are marginally religious, meaning they go to church because they feel obligated to go, not because they want to. Following a confrontation with some goons working for the Russian mob, the brothers have what appears to be a religious moment, an apparent message from God that they should dole out vigilante justice on whatever criminals they see fit to do away with. The brothers set out on a killing spree, suddenly blessed with skills in handling firearms fit for military sharpshooters. They are aided by their friend Rocco, who conveniently enough happens to be a low level employee of the Italian mob. Rocco is the most likable character in the movie, overshadowing the brothers in all the scenes they're in with his charisma, which is surprising because he isn't a professional actor and got the role because he's friends with Troy Duffy. The brothers and Rocco are pursued FBI Agent Paul Smecker, a hard edged homosexual, portrayed in a gleeful, over the top fashion by Willem Dafoe, whose performance is the highlight of the whole movie.Troy Duffy's script is full of so many holes, his lack of experience of a writer is obvious. Unexplained and illogical elements of the story are introduced on a whim simply because they're convenient for advancing the plot, and then these elements are immediately forgotten and never mentioned again. One example is the brothers ability to speak fluently five languages; this is introduced right before Conor has to speak in Russian on the phone while posing as a mobster to find out the location of a meeting between the Russian crime bosses. It's never explained why these two guys know the languages, except that ""their mother insisted on it"", or why two people who were that well educated are working in a meat packing plant and living in a filthy one room apartment. Instead, this unique ability to speak 5 languages is never even mentioned again and after Conor gets off the phone with the Russians. There are coincidences that are so forced and unbelievable that they can't be taken seriously. Unfortunately, this movie isn't a parody. It wants to be taken seriously, despite moments of comic relief.The religious aspect appears to be little more than an excuse to condone the brothers' actions. What they're doing is God's will, so it's okay. Duffy wants this to be a compelling study of a controversial issue, but instead he is biased and one sided. The men that the brothers kill are sleazy, disgusting human beings with no positive traits, while the brothers are agents on a mission handed down from God. It's such a black and white portrayal of the subject that it fails to be provocative. What if the brothers killed a mobster who'd been developed as a character who loves his kids and his wife, rather than a caricature who kills mercilessly and has no regard for anyone else? Boondock Saints is a watchable movie because there are some well done action scenes and a couple of good laughs along the way, but by the end it's still a pretentious movie that wants to be thought provoking but isn't. It has the makings of a good movie that could have gone either way, in that it could have been a satire/parody, or it could have been an action movie combined with a social commentary, but it fails to be either. Instead it takes itself too seriously to be a parody or satire, and it isn't smart enough to provide any social commentary, and ends up being nothing more than a predictable vigilante movie that doesn't really stand out.",The Boondock Saints

From my perspective, I can only say that I did not care about these two brothers or their perceived calling to free the world from scum. They are pretentious and sanctimonious serial murderers who use religion to justify their crimes. Add into this mix a ridiculous subplot of a gay cross-dressing FBI agent and, well, what more needs to be said? Incidentally, I have not heard the ""F"" word used so much in a movie. I am not a prude, but this was so repetitive as to be abusive to the audience. If you like non-stop swearing, murdering, slow motion slaughter, straining to understand dialogue buried in Irish brogue, and attempts to rip off Tarantino's style then go ahead and sit through this turkey. Otherwise, go see Taxi Driver, Death Wish, or The Star Chamber or any other vigilante movie. I can't imagine any other vigilante movie could be worse than this one.",The Boondock Saints
329,Slick-37,"So ""cool"" it sucks",1,11 June 2007,"I suppose I can see how so many people could've been hoodwinked into thinking this was a good movie. It just piles a bunch of ""cool"" imagery and ideas together and flings them onto the screen. ""Boondock Saints"" is one of the more shallow bits of cinema to cross my path in a while. The twins are fantastic shots when hanging upside down from twisted rope while spinning and wearing ski masks. But line them up in front of one man in broad daylight and they're lucky to escape with their lives. Speaking of shallow cool and that particular gunfight... It looks cool when a man opens his overcoat to reveal a vest with 6 holsters, each containing a badass looking handgun in slow-motion. So while he's constantly running out of bullets and, lightning-quick, whipping out a new gun, the twins have their divine guns that never need to be reloaded. That's one of the main problems with this movie, it can't decide if it's going to be one of those ""reload during a gunfight"" flicks or a ""just keep shooting and never run out of bullets"" flicks. Just when you think the movie's going to laugh at itself (""THERE WAS A FIREFIGHT!!!!!!!), it actually shows you that it doesn't get its own joke.As far as the murky morality goes, it wants to come across as leaving the judgement as to whether the twins are right or wrong to the viewer. But the camera and the script love these Irish rogues a little too much. Lingering on their nakedness, their wicked grins, and their righteousness a little too long.Willem Dafoe is a great actor and he does his best with the unfortunate script. But behind every great actor is a great director and Dafoe's performance makes me think Duffy was never there to reign in Dafoe's fantastic imagination and energy.Finally, I can understand the need for Rocco's character; the twins need a spaz around so they look even cooler by comparison.

333,hotcarl44,Must we always focus on the bad?,10,25 April 2000,"Caught in the wonderful war of Blockbuster trying to run a monopoly on some movies (see Pi), Boondock Saints will never get the publicity it deserves. There is something for every decent movie fan in this wonderfully directed (first time director Troy Duffy) film.  We can start with Duffy. He was a bartender who wrote the script, was wooed by Miramax and then dumped because he didn't want to play by the Hollywood rules.  (See Oliver Stone Platton and Kubrick).  I have respect for men who want to do movies the way THEY want to, not the way people tell them to do it. Next move on to the pure comedy of the movie.  I laughed as much in this movie as i have in any Tarintino movie, and comparisons, other than the time segments is not fair. The movie can stand on its own without any comparisons made.  The numerous jokes made about Vigilantes and Charlie Bronson were also an excellent add in.  The pure violence in the movie was smooth, not too excessive but there was enough to make it not fall into that boring/too fake violence era known as the 80s.  The plot is simple enough, two brothers becomming vigilantes by accident and finding themselves strangely good at it. ""We're good...YES WE ARE.""  But not TOO good, pretty much it seems as if The Hand of God IS guiding them and getting them out of trouble.  Its not too religious, its not too much bullshit, its a great blend of action and comedy.  The question is WHY NOT can't this happen?  A great added bonus to the movie is the interviews at the end, perhaps poking fun at the american public and the media.  There are some good comments.Conclusion:  This is one the best movies that will never make it to theaters....because Hollywood didn't let it.",The Boondock Saints
334,squeakerth2,Hollywood's Hidden Gem,10,19 September 2003,"Boondock Saints is one of the best movies that I have ever seen (and I've seen a lot of movies).  I found out about this movie purely through word of mouth.  It seemed to spread like wildfire among my friends.  Before I knew it, everybody had heard about it, seen it, and loved it (guys and girls alike).  If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing out.  That's all I have to say.",The Boondock Saints
335,chimoves,Symbolism and The American Unconscious,10,22 February 2000,"I was fortunate enough to stumble on this movie at my local video store. What an unexpected joy it was to watch this iconoclastic film.  The humor, action, symbolism, and overall inter-connectedness of the film is excellent.  I particularly enjoyed the numerous symbolic representations as well as the mythic hero's journey in modern day Boston. My friends and I were touched by the brotherly love, the direct action (retribution), and the interwoven expressions of authentic spiritual focus.What American doesn't have at least an occasional desire to ""take out the bad guys?"" What person, with any intelligence, isn't sick & tired of the stifling oppression of ""political correctness"" that has flooded into every aspect of American life in the last 15 years. This film gives vent to many of those feelings, and puts ""paid"" to the account.I think that this film will end up a cult classic. It is an modern epic, a revolution of iconoclastic blasts at the excepted and explained, the injustice and absurdity of current American society.And... it is just plain good fun. Humor, action, good guys winning, bad guys wasted, the forces of light marching to glory against darkness. Luke Skywalker",The Boondock Saints

Now it's everywhere, on sale in Target and Best Buy instead of buried at Blockbuster.  I love Tarantino, but that doesn't mean I can't also love this film, which is funny, gory, and features great performances by Willem Dafoe, Sean Patrick Flannery and a host of supporting actors.  True, Tarantino makes funny violent films, but why does he get control of the market? Troy Duffy, who both wrote and directed, is an inspiration to all those aspiring film-makers who don't think they'll ever get their chance.  While not perfect due to a tiny budget and short shooting schedule, the film delivers a great story, tempering violence with humor, and leaves one with a moral dilemma: is vigilantism good or bad?  And if all that doesn't convince you to see it tune in just to watch Ron Jeremy, porn star extraordinaire, keep his clothes on as a mafia capo.  Oh, and watch out for the sequel, due in the next year.",The Boondock Saints

I cannot fathom anyone disliking this movie.  If you do, please e-mail me and explain why, so I can try to understand your kind a little better.  I thank my lucky stars that this project was ditched by Paramount and Artisan picked it up.  I don't think Patrick Swayze or Mark Wahlberg could have done this movie justice. The only regret I have about this film is that I was not able to see it in the theater, because of a lack of a distributor.  Oh, well.

This is one of those films. Weird-ass directing and editing and timing. Iconoclastic (aka weird) does not necessarily equal good.

The Boondock Saints is the equivalent of 'Rocky Horror Picture Show' of the action genre. Full of QT style dialog, slow motion filled gun fights and who can forget there prayer? Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus are great as the anti heroes of the movie, The McManus Brothers. Highly recommend it to anybody that enjoys cult movies.""And Shepherds we shall be For thee, my Lord, for thee. Power hath descended forth from Thy hand Our feet may swiftly carry out Thy commands.

Willem Defoe's performance is, in my humble opinion, the best performance of his career (and the studios wanted Bill Murray to play Smecker).  Of course, the actor who stole the show was David Della Rocco.  He was an excellent actor who, I hope, will show up again in other films. The film raises several moral questions.  They kill people who would kill good people.  The Saints kill mobsters, pimps, and thugs.  Are their actions truly harming society?Who knows for sure...",The Boondock Saints
342,JPOmalley,The funniest piece of crap I have ever seen,1,15 January 2002,"A friend recommended this film to me and so a group of us got together to watch it. Not understanding that Dafoe was gay at first and then realizing in hilarity that he was, I laughed my way through this absurd attempt at a good independent film. The casting of Ron Jeremy in any role in this film immediately diminished any legitimate value it held. I especially like the need for a Ron Jeremy sex scene, (give him something he knows guys, don't let him stretch his characters beyond porn). There are too many horridly overacted Willam Dafoe scenes to recall, and for this reason I figured it was made early in his career. 1999! Less than five years after the English patient (though four, after speed 2) it is so sad to see a good actor acting badly in such a ridiculous film. Willam Dafoe has had a rollercoaster career of inspiring roles and hilarious flops. The sad part is that, (I imagine) Dafoe and the makers of this film thought they were doing something truly important. Save this stuff for film school, and Willem...I'm disappointed.",The Boondock Saints
343,cancerous,"Not great, but has great parts (Possible spoiler)",6,30 March 2002,"Don't be fooled. This is no Reservoir Dogs. There are too many conventionally violent and trashy scenes to be anywhere near as good as that. Still, the unconventional scenes it does have make the whole thing worth watching. My favorite is when Willem Dafoe explains how a shootout occurred while it is shown taking place right next to him. That's original, nifty, and highly entertaining. The ending was cool too.",The Boondock Saints
344,panthers2805,Excellent Film,9,1 April 2008,"After hearing so much about it, i finally picked up a copy of The Boondock Saints and watched it. Now i know why everyone talks about it so much, what an amazing movie.Though some of the action and jokes were a bit corny, the overall intent of the movie was spot on. The character of Rocco was a bit far fetched, and he brought the overall seriousness of the movie down a little bit. However, i think he is a key character in the sense that, he, a senseless hoodlum, can end up becoming a reckless vigilante. I'm not sure if the filmmakers intent was to lead you to think that what they did was wrong, but Rocco was definitely evidence supporting that. I, like many others, would be scared to know that guys like Rocco are walking the streets killing ""bad"" people.The McManus brothers were more thoughtful and sincere in their plotting to kill evil-doers. The are on the opposite side of Rocco on that same coin. They lead us to believe that there are people out there with their heads on straight, and that they are capable of doing good the dirty way.The filmmakers were neutral, however. They leave it up to the viewer to decide. This is made known in the background scenes of the credits which show the citizens being interviewed. Some may think they are doing good; others think they are complete whack jobs with guns. It's up to you to decide...Thats why i particularly enjoyed this one.One criticism i do have of the movie, however, is the whole subplot of The Duke. Who is this guy? What did he do? And why the hell does he randomly side with the McManus brothers?!? Other than that i thought the story was great. Others may think that the corny religious music and Christian undertones was poor. I, however, am a sucker for the melodramatic music and religious plugs. This movie is awesome.",The Boondock Saints
345,Helto1,"Fun, action packed, with a great story!",9,4 December 2002,"I wasn't sure what to make of this film when a friend sat me down to watch it.  I read the dvd liner notes, and thought, ""oh great, another Professional/Commando.""  But it isn't.  Right from the beginning, you're entrenched in this gritty, religious, good vs. evil story.   The two brothers get into a bar fight with these Russian mafia guys, over their local Irish Pub losing it's right to run.  You can tell these guys want to make sure what's right, what's good, what is pure in this world, is kept sacred, and kept from being taken down with all that is evil.  The acting is tremendous.  Sean Patrick Flanery, Willem Dafoe, and the great supporting cast, make for pure enjoyment for the viewer.  The dialogue is tremendous as well.  From their speech before they kill someone, to the little digs that they have on each other, it's very refreshing, very original.  I liked this movie.

(along with their annoying Italian-American sidekick) & a mob-hired ""assassin"" It's a typically unbelievable, overdone, & ridiculous scene....but that's not what is so awful.In a later scene, the boys find themselves once again encountering the assassin.

They were all so nutty about it and insisted that I watch it with them. So I eventually had some free time and headed out to my friends house to check it out.Big Mistake.Before the film even started they were telling me ""Man you're gonna love it!"" and ""Dude this movie is soooooo badass!"" and ""Wait until you see this one scene, its so damn cool!"" I'd to put part of the blame on my friends over-hyping as to why the movie was terrible, but thats just not the case. The acting was absolutely awful, the characters weren't even close to developed, and the plot was so trite that it hurt to watch. Even if I had been told that the film was absolutely terrible I would have still been shocked. The only reason people think they like the film is because of the violence, but I am 100% honest when I tell you that the best violence in the world could not help this awful movie.This is definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

And you don´t need to be on drugs (or at least have the same mood) to understand this movie. Everything is plain but clever, easy but smart.The ""heroes"" do  the things they do, because they believe in justice and use therefore self-justice.At the end of the movie (after some ""bloody"" scenes) you remember yourself that you are in your favorite cinema and you ask yourself: ""Yes, this is great movie.

I have already watched it three times in one day. It is rare I do that. Dogs, The Killer, Hard Boiled, Better Tomorrow are pretty much the only movies I have done that with.The one big plot twist at the end caught me by surprise and that doesn't happen often, hey I figured out Sixth Sense mid way through.I really liked the way Defoe's character played out the scene's especially the one at the house where he is shown side by side with the boys.I recommend anyone who likes John Woo or Quentin Tarrantino pick this movie up.

And, may I say...it was the best $2 I ever spent.Troy Duffy hits the humor on the head in what could have just been a blood and guts movie. The acting is by far well above average. I have found myself watching many movies based on the fact that the actor (mostly Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery) were in this movie. Also, one of my all time favorite...people...appears toward the end of the movie.

They chain one to the toilet, and take the other down into the street to shoot him in the head. These brothers are very closely knit, so the chained down brother struggles, and ends up pulling up the toilet, walking out to the roof holding it, and throws it down onto the head of the one of the mobster that was going to shoot his brother, instantly killing him. Then he jumps down 5 stories to land on the other mobster. They voluntarily come into the police station for questioning, and explain the whole thing. The cops let them loose since it was self defense, and let them sleep in a cell overnight. The next day they get a page on the pager they stole from the mobster. They call the number and the person on the phone tells them to go to where all the heads of the russian mobs are meeting. They decide to kill the rest of the russian mob. They put a plan together, and go to an underground dealer of guns. They trade in everything they have, and sneak into the building and drop down from the vents. They get snagged on the rope that one of the brothers got, much in protest of the other. They hang upside down, and just start shooting. They kill everyone in the room with little effort.

It's  perhaps a shame, though, that there are no real, strong villains to root against - The bad guys in the film are basic cyphers and exist solely to be shot up in a bunch of creative, Woo-homaging ways.A warning:  If you consider yourself a cat lover, don't even THINK about catching this flick - You'll be outraged for days afterwards.",The Boondock Saints
361,Porkchop147,Has first-time filmmaker written all over it,6,23 April 2001,"This is not a terrible film, but it's certainly no masterwork.  It is abundantly obvious that it was put together by a first time writer/director struggling to find a voice and a style.  He tries out some John Woo, some Scorsese, a lot of Tarantino, and innumerable other imitations, and the result is a confused mish mash.  Individual scenes are not badly done, but they don't gel when taken as a whole.  Often we are left with little sense of where we are or how we got there.  There are huge leaps of narrative logic that are very difficult to accept.  The dialogue is sometimes clever, and at other times tries too hard to be.That being said, some of the acting is excellent, especially from Sean Patrick Flannery whose Irish accent seems flawless and whose performance is intense and likeable.  Willem Dafoe is very good, though sometimes over the top.  And some scenes are genuinely funny, others genuinely exciting.But it's hard to overlook the film's unabashed glorification of vigilante violence.  It makes a feeble, half-hearted attempt to show the other side of the argument during the ending credits, but it feels tacked on and, like many other parts of the film, doesn't mesh with the rest very well.

Concerning two Irish-American brothers in Boston who become vigilantes against the mob and general criminal element of Boston. The young actors portraying the brothers are excellent,especially Sean Patrick Flannery. Willem Dafoe plays a detective who can recreate the crime scene with an uncanny flair for detail. As he does so,we the viewers actually get to see what happened as he describes it. The brothers are sometimes aided by their friend and mob insider Rocco. Although the movie is violent,it is not excessively so,and the film is punctuated with much humor,particularly from Rocco and Dafoe's character. One person in the cast is particularly good in a small role that would not be fair to describe as this character is vital the last section of the film.

If we know who the bad guys are, and we have the power to stop them before they do anything else, then why don't we? This movie shows two brothers who feel religiously compelled to rid the world of evil.In my opinion, this is the new brand of super hero. These two brothers fight bad guys, but they are still human, and they smoke, they curse, they aren't some super human. It looks a lot like Constantine, and to some degree even Batman.

Whether it be the cheesy cliches, the fact that they do everything in unison (EVERYTHING), or the awful dialogue, etc, this proves to be the worst film on the planet.  I figured movies like ""The Exorcist II:  The Heretic"" had it taken care of but this takes the cake.  The worst part is that it could have been so cool. Irish guys take out Italian mobsters, sickness!  Oh no, not this movie, instead we get a couple of pansies hanging from ropes upside down killing people, that may sound cool but it's not.  They seem to have perfect aim upside down, but when they shoot at one Russian guy out in the open, no, instead we got stuff flying everywhere and all sorts of crap as Willem Dafoe over does it completely.  The worst part is that most of you losers like this movie.  I don't get it, what is to be liked.  Every actor sucks here, ALL OF THEM.  They all need to be butchered for this movie.  The script makes no sense either.  How can they speak so many languages?  The action sucks.  The quick cuts and MTV style directing is straight out of the minor leagues.  Then we have the two bit s***head mobsters.  These guys are more one dimensional than the fans of crap movies like this.  I read on the back that fans of Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction would like this, no chance in hell.  Those movies had witty dialogue, class, and a soul.  This movie has bad dialogue, bad directing, and bible preaching.  Let's see, choppy directing that sucks, bad actors (except Willem Dafoe who could do nothing with his poorly written part), bad action, awful script (simply putrid), a foolish fan base, one dimensional characters, etc.  make this the worst film ever put on film.

I could tell within the first 5 minutes that there was something wrong with this movie. When Dafoe's character (not even gonna spend time researching this homosexual acting detective's name..honestly this was the first Dafoe character I COULD NOT WATCH- I was surprised to see him stoop to this level) hands his coat off to the other detective the shot jumps awkwardly (amateur editing). When the Russian mobsters hits the drinks from the 2 main character's hands, they don't even actually show it....like WTF??Why didn't they find the remnants of a broken toilet in the alleyway btw? Why couldn't they shoot the old assassin with 6 guns when he was standing right in the middle of the road if they're so good at what they do??! Didn't they just expertly execute 9 mobsters while hanging upside from a tangled rope (that was very neatly wound and coiled just 2 secs before btw)? I found the dialogue loud and obnoxious. I'm sure it was meant to be that way and some people that it was ""awesome"" but I just kept turning the volume down, waiting for a reason to continue spending my time watching this. What's with the stupid detective dialogue?? Is it all supposed to make Dafoe look like a genius? How stupid can u be and still become a detective? Again, probably funny to some people...completely obnoxious to me. I have enough respect for great crime movies to know that the detectives and police shouldn't be made to look like total fools unless its slapstick.The prayer they say in unision before they execute the head Russian guy, I'm sure, made tons of people cheer and holler with glee! I laughed at the ridiculousness and cheesiness of it. The music/soundtrack sucked MOST of the time.

378,jay_d_h,"Its, well, different, think Frailty meets lock stock",5,22 August 2003,"Parts of this movie I liked and found very humorous. Other parts I thought were awful. I did not like the acting, others said they thought it was great, I disagree. The plot is horrendous. Its not believable at all because it is full of as many bullet holes as are found at the crime scenes.
I feel this movie is trying so hard to be like lock stock, and tarantino and trying to impart some originality as well. It succeeds at this, but it tries WAY too hard at it. You can feel it the whole movie as they try to capture the vibe of those movies, but never quite nail it. Pulp fiction and lock stock and other crime movies have this cool feeling to them. I don't get that from this movie, its too silly to take seriously and that's my main problem with it. The gun fights are not believable. Look at the scene with ""The Duke"" where they all basically stand there and blast away and with ~100 of shots fired, only about 3 ever find their mark. This is not real life. Someone comes after me I'm going to find some cover, not stand in the open and if I'm this great shot, as they are depicted and the duke is depicted previously, I'm going to hit a little more than 3/100.Also the brothers consistently escaping from handcuffing is unbelieavable as well.The religious aspects are poorly done. The concept in Frailty is very similar to this movie, and it handles the religious aspect MUCH better.This could have been a much better movie, I like the idea, but the plot has too many holes and the religious aspect is handled poorly, I like the style of it, but it can't capture the vibe of the movies it emulates, I like the way the violence is handled, but its not believable, I like the humor, but it is too off the wall and prevents me from taking the movie seriously, I like the characters but they are overacted.

They could have said fluffy bunnies for all I care, it doesn't matter, but hearing the same word every 2 seconds gets REALLY annoying after 1.5 hours.",The Boondock Saints
379,BankBastard,The Boondock Saints,1,12 July 2003,"*A lot of Spoilers*Almost all of my friends told me to watch this movie. ""It's so sick"", ""Great Movie"", ""It's so badass"", and ""It is in a category of it's own""... well, I can honestly say that ""The Boondock Saints"" was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and had it not been for Willem Dafoe, it would have easily been the worst movie of all time. (A title currently held by both The Exorcist II and The Amityville Horror). This movie is crap, there is no way around it. The cult status it has climbed to is baffling. The fact that many people enjoy this movie is beyond the realm of human comprehension. I cannot understand. It has a lousy story line, and it doesn't gel or make sense. The action is GARBAGE. I don't care what anyone says, it blows. Its cheesy, dull and anticlimactic... Half of the ""action"" is bad quick-cut scenes zooming in on aftermath, or shots of people shooting up a storm. For some reason people can't seem to shoot each other from ten feet away, and while dangling upside-down in a room full of gangsters, these jerks kept their bearings and shot up the joint, killing almost 10 mobsters (How can they shoot so well? why can't mobsters shoot? what was holding up the rope?). Why were they so smart? why did they pack meat for a living if they could speak multiple languages? How come he didn't die after jumping off a building at least 5 stories high into an alley? What the hell was the writer thinking? The acting, with the exception of Willem Dafoe (why did he have to crossdress? honestly...), was ghastly. The Irish accents were brutal, and the overdone villains were just as horrendous. The whole ""we're catholic, but we execute Mobsters"" thing was also swill. The prayer being spoken in unison was so lame!! Who writes this crap? The whole symmetric action shots of them lighting cigarettes, praying, shooting, etc. were so corny I was ashamed of myself for watching, and I was hoping nobody would come into the room and watch... I would have been reprimanded for watching such trash. The accents from the ""Saints"" were like a poor man's Mickey, from ""Snatch""...a good movie. This movie is so flawed, so cheesy, and so boring I was shocked after I watched it. Also, another atrocity is that its being compared to Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. How dare someone make that comparison? Those movies are masterpieces, with good actors, excellent dialogue, perfect direction, fitting music (this movie had the worst music I think I've ever heard in a film) and reasonable story lines. This movie was the polar opposite of that. Irish people should be appalled by this... anyone from Boston should be appalled by this... every person on the face of the earth should be appalled by this. What gets me the most is the alienation that people who don't like this movie feel. They become outcasts in the conversation... I Just don't get it... we need more movies like Commando, Terminator, Aliens, Rambo, Cliffhanger, or Predator... hell, even Marked for Death or Cobra (that's right, 1986 Sly Stallone) is better than this. Its a sad day when people think that Matrix movies and this refuse are excellent action films. Shed a tear for a near dead genre. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, unless you want to watch it in order to make a subsequent film look really good.  ½ star/ 5. This movie is on par with Jaws 4 and Barb Wire... despicable...

The movie is filled with exciting killings that have a comic twist to them.  Willem Dafoe is excellent and struggules with the twists and turns of the killing scheme.  The camera angles used in the Boondock Saints, add to the overall production of the film by acurately capturing even the most miniscule details that later become important.The screenplay and language is abnormally good considering the most commonly used work is f*^k.

382,Lorinda-2,I didn't like it. Here's why....,1,13 January 2004,"This is a film that you will either like because you pick out the good parts or hate because you simply can't get past the bad parts. I couldn't get past the bad parts. For starters, the film is very improbable as well as unrealistic with too many silly elements that do not at all mesh with the very serious and dramatic tone maintained throughout. Because the film doesn't contain the necessary parts of a satire it can't be argued that it was meant to be one. In the end, the movie ends up being 2 hours of outlandish violence and very irritating characters that received way too much screen time. I found myself wanting to fast forward any scene containing the minor character Rocco. And the 5 minute flaky detective scenes where he is singing to opera music and dressing in drag was just too senseless and foolish for me to stomach. I would have at least felt better about movie if, at the end, the Irish brothers recognized Rocco's annoying mannerisms and shot him for being so aggravating and stupid! The only `saving grace' about this movie, and the only reason I would ever consider re-watching this movie, is the `coolness' of the two brothers. The brothers interacted well together and were very entertaining to watch so long as they weren't in any scenes with any of the other characters. In conclusion. I found this movie to be annoying and very disappointing. It has a good premise, though not original. Nothing was special about the editing or special effects, or even the characters themselves.  If you want a movie with good shootouts, and `cool' guys with real accents check out movies like Snatch or Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. These movies are a lot of what this movie wishes it could at least be compared to. As for the director's debut: He needs a lot more practice and I'd like to know how he goes from an absolute nobody to getting such a movie budget to make such a horrid film. I guess some ideas sound better on paper.",The Boondock Saints

The moral or theme has been done before- and done better- but the story and characters are compelling enough to make it interesting.  Not a first-rate movie, but Boondock Saints is certainly one of the best assassin films in recent years as evidenced by the movie's cult following.  Worth seeing and worth owning ($10 on DVD almost everywhere). Connor and Murphy McManus are brothers who begin a crusade against drug dealers, hitmen, and the mafia.  They receive assistance from a blundering friend, Rocco, and together the unlikely group begin to deconstruct Boston's Russian mob.

The plot has a few holes in it because of what I'm assuming to be forced editing, but I'm able to suspend belief for other parts. A few times one of the brothers slips in his Irish accent, which takes the audience out of the movie for a moment, but the action forces us back in it. And I would have liked focusing more on the brothers and not having them share the spotlight with Della Rocco for a huge chunk of the movie. Della Rocco's part was a good one a very well played, but his part in the overall story was too large. I also liked how there were no women love interests. I just think that the movie would have been bogged down if there was a love interest. It was a lot funnier than I had expected it to be. Especially in the deleted scenes section of the DVD. I find the underlying theme of morality and ethics to be a big part of it, however I didn't pay attention to it.

This movie is to Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs what ""Slumber Party Massacre 2"" is to Psycho. It is a sad attempt to remake the whole ""cool and tough criminals kill bad guys in a really cool and tough fashion while saying cool and tough one-liners"" genre. Unfortunately, it lacks all originality and the script is far from clever. Every character is one-dimensional; the so-called organized criminals are just a bunch of morons who get slaughtered in their hundreds by two meat packers from Southie. Meanwhile, entire scenes are lifted from Pulp Fiction: the cat accidentally being killed (paralleling Marvin's unfortunate fate in Pulp Fiction), the bible quotes before executions, and the constant oh-so-cleverly random conversations that don't come close to stuff Tarantino probably wrote in Grade school. By the way, the acting sucks. Finally, the message that it's good for vigilantes to kill the brainless ethnic stereotypes that pass for mafiosi in this movie (as well as random guys at a strip club; I guess they're criminal scum as well) whenever they feel like it will appeal to armchair suburbanites scared of those big city lowlifes whom they've heard about on the news--it will seem ludicrous to anyone else.

I also enjoyed the interviews that ran during the end credits. There you can really see the different attitudes that people have towards the actions of Murphy and Conner. Some people think it's wonderful that someone does the dirty work and takes on the criminals, and some people think that the two brothers just want to be famous.

Troy Duffy's take on the cops and criminals genre is at times cardboard cut-out, but believably so. The 'boys' are good and Rocco's a bit of fun. Perhaps Willem Dafoe's best role since ""The Last Temptation of Christ"". I have to admit I rented this movie for Billy Connolly and was disappointed that there wasn't more of him, but I was pleased with what there was.Despite really liking this movie something has to be said about the portrayal of ""crusading vengeance"".

394,bgbacardi,Deplorable,1,31 January 2004,"""The Boondock Saints"" possesses one of the most despicable and putrid hearts of any movie I have ever seen.  The film exalts the MacManus brothers as a couple of death angels, exempt from the laws of God they so mercilessly impose on others.  Far from the truth, the brothers are sadistic and frightening, less human than the criminals and drug dealers they kill with staggering enjoyment.  I find it truly horrific that people could actually believe these boys are doing the right thing, as if fulfilling some holy edict.  In their quest to rid the world of evil, they reveal their own relentless bloodthirst and show themselves to be true avatars of evil - those that kill under the guise of goodness (like the Nazis).  A film condemning these two would be fine but this film seems to wholeheartedly believe in their deluded divine right.  Worse yet, the film is very poorly made.  Except for Willem Dafoe's oddly fascinating turn in drag, the acting is uniformly one-note, the plot deficient, the dialogue leaden, the action scenes preposterous, the climax ineffectual and the directing stilted. The coup de grace of this immoral mess comes at the very end, where, after what seems like hours of die-hard nihilistic conviction, the director throws in a few interview scenes to muddle the message.  He probably thought this was the perfect coda to elevate the story into a realm of public thought. Instead, these final scenes betray his disguise, and the entire film, as amateurish moral posturing.",The Boondock Saints

This is not just a violent story with two psychopaths. These are angels, sent from heaven to make the world a better place for everybody, by killing all evil....that is atleast what they believe! The story of the friendship between the brothers Conner and Murphy are also an important issue of this movie. Willem Dafoe plays a great role as FBI agent Paul Smecker head investigator of this case. Paum Smecker is a weird man, whom is gay, but finds out that he really want to help these angels instead of getting them into prison.

Despite there deep religious affiliation, the brothers take the role of modern day Angels of Death, dispensing the evil and sparing the innocent.No movie is perfect, and while the Boondock Saints is an awe inspiring film, some of the acting is over-the-top, and there are some plot holes, but overall the movie was simply amazing.Do yourself a favor.

Two Irish Catholic brothers decide to bring their own brand of justice to the world via masks and silenced pistols. As they kill off the scum of Boston, they are investigated by an FBI agent played by Willem Dafoe.This movie has 2 major pitfalls. One of which, is the character's over-acting, especially Willem Dafoe's. You really don't have to be a movie buff to pick out the bad acting in this movie. Dafoe's part is so overplayed, it takes away from the gritty realism this movie might have otherwise.The other problem with this movie is its rather predictable story. There are really no surprises in this one. It would've been nice to see the writer take the movie into a darker path exploring the moral conflicts between the religiosity of the brothers and their actions. Instead, they are pretty much hardened killers immediately after their first kills. This brings a lack of depth to the main characters, leaving you detached from them.I also had problems with the gratuitous use of slow motion in this movie. Sure, slow motion filming has its uses, however it almost always detracts from grittiness and realism. Action scenes in good gritty movies are almost always filmed in regular speed and with ambient noise.All in all, The Boondock Saints is an interesting idea written and filmed with disappointing and predictable Hollywood cookie cutter styles.",The Boondock Saints

405,IndieRockLance,Vastly Overrated,4,4 March 2006,"The Boondock Saints is the epitome of an over-hyped movie that people will themselves into believing to be better than it actually is. And, on first glance, it does look like a decent movie. But when you look closer, it becomes extremely apparent that it's all flash and no substance. Duffy masks the contrived plot and silly, inexplicable motives for characters with violence. Characters become superheroes on a whim, no one is developed to the point where emotional development has zero impact. Instead, the film plays up the emotional moments as over-the-top as possible to cram that emotional value into your head.There are very admirable performances in the film by Billy Connolly and Willam Dafoe, but the problem here is in the direction and the writing. Some of the most absurd moments come from the direction of the actors. For instance, the scene in which Willam Dafoe attempts to reenact the shootout between the Saints and the Duke doesn't pack the emotional punch that Duffy intends, it only comes off as silly and cliché. The best you can hope for in this film are some brief funny moments and a lot of nonsense that you'll have to wade through that it's really just not worth it.Ultimately, the film can be summed up with a quote from the movie itself, ""Movies. You see this in bad movies."" Even if Miramax had picked the film up and set the budget at $15 million like the original plan, it still would have fallen to pieces due to Duffy's incompetence as a director.As a big, stupid action movie, it's mediocre. As the movie that was supposed to save the industry, it's weak even by dumb action film standards. There are plenty of better movies, so why rally around this one?",The Boondock Saints
406,johnbeer,God's private killers...,10,16 May 2002,"Just like Elwood and Jake who were on a mission from God in the Blues Brothers, the 2 main characters in The Boondock Saints are doing their thing for the lord; only instead of signing and dancing, theire killing and breaking hell.Many have already compared The Boondock Saints to films like Lock, Stock and Two smoking barrels, Pulp fiction and even Kubrick's The Killing, and they arent entirely wrong; this movie has got plenty of blood, bounty hunters working for bad guys, guns, more guns, snappy dialogue and unpredictable twists... only this time we see it from a different angle. The wonderful thing about this movie is that it actually found a fresh plot and a new way to tell a story involving cops, bad guys and god bad guys (the 2 main characters).William Defoe's acting is top of the line. He plays an FBI cop looking for the meaning of the murders happening in the city. His character is the link between the killings and we learn the story of the killers through his investigation.Altough it involves God and religion, the movie is far from moralistic. It's just a very good movie, brilliantly directed and very enjoyable for anyone who likes a good action/crime movie.",The Boondock Saints
407,supercoop87,Worth Seeing...I Guess,5,27 August 2003,"I saw this movie for the first time last night after it had been recommended by a lot of people. I don't generally like movies like this where you have a couple of guys who try to be super-cool and shoot whoever they want but still appeal to the audience by their wit and snide remarks. This film was much like Pulp Fiction in this way, but it didn't even come close to what Tarantino did. First, for all you people who said it had great religions overtones, just because the movie's two main characters are Catholic and wear Rosaries around their necks (which is sacreligious anyways), and cross themselves before going into action, and say some prayer ending with ""Father, Son, and Holy Spirit"" in Latin doesn't mean the movie gives some strong religious message. Yeah, they were ridding the world of evil and some would say they are doing God's work by getting rid of all the evil men in a city. But, I didn't see anywhere where they were granted permissioin to be God and decide who lives and dies. Most people call that blasphemy. So, if there was a deep religious message that I'm missing please tell me, but for now 5/10.",The Boondock Saints

But it's really not. Note to all: It is possible to make a great movie, without ""copying"" somebody else. Would you call Spielberg ""Unoriginal""?? Sure, why not? The idea of aliens DID exist before he came around, right?? Are you getting my point?? It's possible to build on things that already exist, and making it original all at the same time. That's exactly what Troy Duffy has done here. Just because Boondock Saints has scenes that go backwards (crime scene investigation followed by the crime itself), that does not mean he got the effect from Tarantino. It's inspiration, not copyright infringement.Many may ask: How the hell does this movie has such a big cult following?? Well, I ask you: Why does Rocky Horror Picture Show, or Star Wars, or Star Trek, or X-Files have such HUGE cult followings? Both have the same answer; Because all these things awakened something on the inside of people, which in turn caused them to love it. It sounds cheesy, but the truth isn't anything but some big ball of cheese, right? Think about it. Think of something you truly love....and then think about someone's review of it---tearing it to pieces. That's mostly what I see going on around here. People LOVE this movie. And why not, it's amazing. But when they read something some loser with no imagination wrote about it, they are going to defend it at all costs.*Spoilers Ahead* When watching this movie for the first time, you gotta have an open-mind. It's a rule. You're not gonna get through a movie about two-highly-religious-Irish-brothers-that-go-around-murdering- criminals-while,-at-the-same-time,-outwitting-the-Boston-police,- among-them-a-cross-dressing-homosexual, without having some kind of imagination to enjoy it. Open your mind up, and have some fun. Also, to truly enjoy this film, ya gotta have a sense of humor. If you don't laugh during the scene when Rocco accidently shoots the cat and you see the poor kitty's blood and guts splattered against the wall---you don't have the right sense of humor to enjoy it properly.This film is extremely well-acted, well-directed, and just amazing.

412,AltFilmFan,Just Dreadful.. but could have been something better,3,5 November 2008,"I understand that this picture is pure fantasy and entertainment- to be taken about as seriously as The Rock or Alien vrs Predator- but I find it kind of repugnant.#1 - Characters: Two brothers who are told by god to ""kill bad people"" go on a vigilante murder spree. These are our heroes. Willem Defoe plays not just a stereotypical loud and mean Investigator- (Telling fat cops to go eat more donuts is beyond tired) - but he portrays possibly the most ridiculous homosexual character ever put to screen. He dances through crime scenes, calls his lover a fag- and even cross dresses in order to aid the brothers when they are infiltrate some more bad guys. Wow.#2 - Huge plot problems - The man hired to hunt them down and kill them was their father!? The movies climactic scene is a public execution in a court room?! There is more- but those two are the craziest.#3 Waste - The action is undeniably well handled- and the cast does everything they can to sell this crazy concept- but in the end it comes off as the most frustrating kind of terrible movie: The kind of flick where you could see that with just a little bit of thought, and a little less heavy handedness- could have been quite good, or at least a lot of fun.I am stunned at the cult status and high score this flick has obtained on IMDb- It is an empty exercise- and I am sort of shocked more people don't think so.To be fair- I guess this picture does not ask or require you to think while you watch it- So- If mindless action is your thing- I guess check it out- just maybe turn the sound off.Just saying.",The Boondock Saints

I see why it's compared to Tarantino, even though they're different styles.With flashbacks, high energy violence, and Irish accents that slip in and out of gear, it reminds me of Guy Ritchie movies, but better. I was rooting for the brothers and so is Willem Dafoe, really far out as a gay FBI agent. Too bad I don't see him in the credits for the sequel. He really takes the film over the top into another territory. And if you watch the deleted scenes on the DVD you see that everyone on the set has a great sense of humor.

415,yellowrobe-1,Excruciatingly Bad,3,18 December 2004,"Boondock Saints. Wow. No, I don't mean that in a good way. It was shocking to sit through the hour I managed to watch. To think that someone actually paid money to make this blows me away. At least I only wasted the three bucks to rent it. The first thing that struck me about it's silliness was the ham fisted way that we're shown the twin brothers are very close. Every movement they make is in sync right down to them taking off their shirts to go to sleep in their small bedroom. Actually this comes off more as homo-eroticism than anything else. Just when you think the film has settled down and can't get any more lame, you're treated to something even more ridiculous. The brothers can speak every language, they can survive leaps off of high buildings, they can kill anyone and the police will applaud them. Since I don't care enough about this steaming dog turd to write much more I'll just say Willem Dafoe's character was completely unbelievable and it was a shame one of the legit films Ron Jeremy appears in was this. I'll end by saying, if you love films with Will Smith, Tom Cruise, you'll probably love this. If you can't stand films that those guys make, stay far away.",The Boondock Saints
416,abner_en,"Not perfect, but one of my favorites",8,26 July 2005,"This film is one of the few I can watch over and over again, sometimes twice in a day if I have time. Part of that, of course, is owed to the extremely attractive actors portraying the MacManus brothers, but if that were the sum of the movie's parts, I would only watch the movie once a month, if that.The storyline is not 100% original, and I will admit that Duffy did seem to just point the camera in the general direction of the actors and hope that they did things right. For the most part he got lucky. Norman Reedus, Sean Patrick Flanery, Billy Connolly, and most especially Willem Dafoe are such talented actors that they are able to interpret their characters and carry their scenes, even if most of the supporting actors aren't quite up to par.Reedus and Flanery are endearing as Murphy and Conner; their scenes together - and they're only once apart - are at once hilarious and adorable. Connolly is granted minimal screen time, with only a few lines, but he manages to pull even that off. The shining star, of course, is Willem Dafoe as Paul Smecker, the conflicted FBI agent hot on the trail of the twins, unsure of whether he should help them out or bring them in. The fragmented scenes in which Smecker describes the crimes are interesting, a little like watching Sherlock Holmes in action.The bad points: 1) David Della Rocco as Rocco (how original), package boy for the Yakavetta branch of the Mafia. Rocco has the MacManus brothers' quick tempers without their intelligence or their style. Smecker describes him as ""kind of an idiot,"" and I have to say that I agree. Della Rocco seems to just take the script and run with it without giving any kind of thought to his character. 2) Doc the bartender (Gerard Parkes) seems to have Turrett's as he randomly shouts curse words, and he disappears fifteen minutes into the movie, never to be seen or heard from again. The storyline about his bar being closed down completely fizzles out. 3) Again, the hit-and-miss directing. Duffy got lucky. Very, very lucky. Actors with just a little less talent would have made mincemeat of this movie. 4) The interviews during the credits. The movie does a commendable job of setting up an ethical dilemma. There was no need to belabor it; that ploy served the double purpose of infantilizing the audience and making the movie take itself too seriously. Yes, Duffy, we heard you. The horse is dead.Still, one of my favorite movies. I offer it 8 stars.",The Boondock Saints

The Mc Manus brothers state why they are going around killing all evil men. an example is pimps, drug dealers, and mafiosos killing, getting caught with drugs and other unlawful things that aren't right to be doing yet they can get out on bail same F***ing day. they are doing what everyone's thinking. someone should just go out and kill those mother F***ers right? so i dont know how this movie can be bad. it has great music, great acting, a great plot, and who else can execute a man ripping a toilet seat out of the ground, throwing it off a roof, hitting the mobster thats about to kill his brother with the entire toilet, and jump off a four story building to land on the other mobster and make you want to watch this nearly impossible scene over and over. they execute every single scene in this wonderful movie perfectly.

What many movies are missing these days is originality. While the story itself is nothing new, the way the story is told (especially the cinematography) certainly is. This film is full of action, comedy, and solid acting. The only mark against Boondock Saints is that Willam Defoe is a bit cheesy at times, but it is not often enough to really take away from the overall realism of the dialog. Many compare and contrast this movie with Pulp Fiction. One thing the two certainly have in common is that they make characters who are unimaginable in real life seem completely natural and real.

I say ""slightly an exaggeration"" only because I am a practicing Catholic and, well, you know how we are on that subject. I'm sure lots of people would categorize this film as an outright abortion.Here's all you need to know: 1) The acting sucks. It is so bad that you have to think it's being done on purpose. Kind of like a Saturday Night Live skit; 2) The script is a joke. The whole movie is so disjointed, the dialog so inane, you have to figure the scriptwriters were severely intoxicated fraternity boys; 3) The directing was, we'll here I go again, an abortion.Save a nice piece of your life and don't waste even 5 minutes watching this movie.",The Boondock Saints

426,aduckworth,"I was curious, but now I'm not...",3,26 February 2005,"I first heard about this film while working at a multimedia department store a few years back when a customer had asked if we carried it. It wasn't in the store, and he said something along the lines of ""*snicker*, probably because it was banned."" I was never able to confirm whether this film was actually banned or not, but I don't see why it would be necessary to ban it (or ANY film that isn't snuff, for that matter) when films that are arguably much much MUCH more violent and much more blasphemous had been released before it. And I see nothing about a ban being placed on it in the trivia or on the message boards (unless I've missed something). So I'm venturing a guess to say that this guy didn't know what he was talking about.Regardless, I came across a cheap copy of the DVD at a used store and decided to check it out, because usually I'm interested in a lot of films that have an aura of ""controversy"" or are rumored to have some element of ""extremity"" in them, so I figured I might get some form of enjoyment out of it. In the end, the only thing I really liked about it was the fact that Willem Dafoe was in it (note that I didn't say I necessarily enjoyed his *performance*, but rather just the fact that he was IN it was somewhat amusing). Oh, and I laughed during one scene when David Della Rocco's character was so completely flabbergasted by all the death that surrounded him that he just kept stammering the F-word over and over again, trying to form a sentence, but eventually just gave up and jumped up in the air, dropping a big F-bomb -- in a film with 246 occurrences of the F-word, that was the ONE moment where I felt that the absurdity of the language really matched up with the absurdity of the situation. Bravo.Otherwise, I was not very shocked or entertained by this film (though I suppose I understand where its appeal lies). Generally what irks me about a lot of modern action films is, to invent a term, their ""cultural consciousness"" - that is to say, it is very conscious of its own ""edgyness."" While the Boondock Saints has an interesting gimmick going for it - the idea of killing in the name of God - it winds up being no more than just that: a gimmick. The rest of the story is just a matter of keeping the audience entertained. Throw in some heavy guitars and some big-beat electronica in the background of every action sequence, saturate the dialog with obscenities, and have the characters act like they're constantly on edge and have them do ""crazy"" things, such as reciting prayers just before they blow someone's head off (oh, and throw in a character with Turrets just for the hell of it). This style seems directly catered to an audience that wants to see something that's ""edgy,"" ""unusual"" or ""extreme"" but has little or no concept of just how amazingly extreme and sophisticated things can get once you go beyond Hollywood and the block-buster world (note: This is NOT a Hollywood film, but it is not unlike something I would expect to see come out of Hollywood {and props to the director for being able to achieve this on a shoestring budget, but I have to wonder, if you're an indie film maker who wants to make something ""extreme,"" why would you look to Hollywood as a model for extreme film-making...?} Also, I do not mean to imply that nothing in the mainstream is of any value, because there are a LOT of major films that deserve their successes... but rather more often than not the most valuable films tend to come from people who are not trying to mass-market their art {and in modeling his style after Hollywood film-making, it looks as though he is trying to achieve this... and I imagine he'll get a bigger budget for the sequel}).Ultimately, as I said before, this film comes across as being VERY conscious of its own ""edgyness,"" and it is this quality that ruined this film for me, as well as countless others. As for all the comparisons to Tarantino - they simply are not justified. Sure, Tarantino is fond of incorporating absurd violence and excessive foul language into his films, but what drives his films is the way he sets up his narratives and dialog sequences to generate implicit meanings (rather than EXplicit) so that the violent scenes seem all the more absurd, not to mention his style which is essentially taking references to a zillion other films and combining them all and reshaping them to create something that is entirely his own. So in essence, saying that the Boondock Saints is ""like a Tarantino film"" is like saying Santa Claus is ""like Jesus."" To be honest, it's not a terrible film (there are MUCH lamer action flicks out there, and much lamer things being produced by Hollywood in general), and I'm certainly not going to be the asshole who says ""this film is morally corrupt and therefore it is harmful to society,"" but I was ultimately disappointed by it after being exposed to all the hype.-adam",The Boondock Saints

William Dafoe's character didn't work for me at all.. until maybe the middle of the movie when his role shifted from cool know-it-all fbi agent to individual. prior to that i thought his character was far-fetched, unbelievable, and silly. as far as the idea of this movie's high moral content and provocative religious theme; while it was handled smoothly, none of this is new or thought provoking, raise questions? did the movie really get inside you, where you are thinking about the issues for days after?? no. the quality of the film-making was average, writing average, and it was really inconsistent. but it has classic quotable lines, and some great comedic moments, and the chemistry of the actors and the overall flow of the film was excellent. also loved seeing an atypical gay character on screen, very refreshing. great performance by rocco. also enjoyed some of the the murphy brothers characters emotion and sensitivity, gave the characters more dimension.a fun romp, but not very memorable.",The Boondock Saints

Some of the acting is below par and you can tell that the making of the boondock saints was severely hampered by its low budget. It does still have a hell of a lot of redeeming features. The dialogue only rarely slips below excellent, the story itself is, in my opinion, one of the best of the last 15 years or so and there is some truly great camera work to appreciate.I just cannot help wondering how great it would have been if miramax had kept its considerable weight behind the project. The higher budget would have enabled the hiring better actors (mainly in the supporting roles, it is unfair to criticise the lead actors as they put in great performances). In my opinion, having a strong supporting cast is what makes a good movie great.So, all in all i would recommend this movie to anyone who likes good characters, great story and sharp, witty dialogue. It will not be the best movie you have ever seen and it probably will not change your life, but it will seriously entertain you and there is enough substance to justify at least a couple of repeat viewings.",The Boondock Saints

It was obviously masterfully directed, scored, and edited. The acting is also very good throughout - especially impressive considering that besides Dafoe, the cast is generally unheard of. One possible criticism is that it lacks a well-defined story and instead builds characters and a goal and consists of ""action sequences"" with simultaneous ""explanation sequences"" as interpreted by the intense, yet flamboyant, Agent Smecker who is played by William Dafoe. While each of these sequences is breathtaking to say the least, at points the lack of a ""big picture"" becomes all too apparent. The distribution troubles involving this film, as well as complications with the sub-par documentary ""Overnight"" have been highly publicized, yet not enough has been said about how GOOD this film really is.

The supporting casts performance left something to be desired, but it is easily looked past. It was never truly meant to be a Hollywood blockbuster. It has Ron Jeremy in it for crying out loud. However, it is a movie with a definitive message. A truly decent message at that, no matter what your spirituality. It should be a mandatory watch for everyone. A wonderful ride.

436,info-6836,My favorite movie of all time...,10,24 December 2005,"A few weeks ago this movie was on Dutch television, I had seen it maybe 15 times in advance but hey....why not watch it again. A very appreciated Dutch television guide said: 'The story is a bunch of separate events put together, causing the story to be a big mess. It's hard to keep up with the events. The only thing that makes you continue watching until the end is the fact that it is a unpredictable story. Watching this movie is interesting but not satisfying at all, you'll regret watching it.' I totally disagree with that. The story is great! It really sets you to thinking about the difference between good and evil, and especially how close good comes to evil sometimes. Director Troy Duffy also did a great job combining the action and comedy in this film. Rocco gives this film the bit of extra spice it needed, he's like a finishing touch. The only point I agree on with the television guide is the fact that the story is absolutely unpredictable! But that's a good thing! The soundtrack of the film is superb.So, if you want to watch a good film, while having some beers with your friends...this is THE film I'd recommend.",The Boondock Saints

Far from the great streetsmart action film that it is praised to be, Boondock Saints is a severely banal and contradictory film that contains poor acting, poor accents and even poorer performances. From the two brothers who are flawed, contradicted and pathetic characters, who are in the movie to tote guns and sport bible lines all to a hip soundtrack and Troy DUffy's pathetically uninteresting vision. THis movie is sacrificed to be what it became- pure Hollywood movie-making; produced only to make money and look entertaining, filled with archetypes where everything leads to something else, with no point and no vision. THe film reaches its sad low-point when Dafoe's uselessly gay character (why? why is he gay?) lets the killers go, because, well, we just don't know.

I liked this movie, and for the following reasons;This is one of those movies where the less explained the better.
Pay attention to the narrative in this movie, it is superbly done. It's both necessary to the central plot, but unobtrusive.
David Della Rocco (Rooco) is absolutely funny as the inept mafia peon (read; total idiot.)
I've never seen Norman Reedus (Murphy) before but after this, I'll definitely look for him in future projects.After Simply Irresistable, I was ready to give up on Sean Flanery (Connor). Fortunately for us all, he does a complete 180 in this movie. Unlike in 'Simply Irresistable', he's almost instantly believable as a pretty fierce guy. I say almost because of the occasional lapses in his accent.
And as for Willem Dafoe, his take on a gay man in a straight law enforcement world is at once honest and funny adding an extra pinch of spice. (But then, he's always great).The only hitch in this film is the actual message. It was never clear to me that God intended this, or if the twins are little on the flip side.
None the less...A great spin on an old fashioned shoot 'em up that doesn't involve fancy martial arts, explosions, or special effects. It's got believable characters in believable situations. And it's got the twice the bang because of it.",The Boondock Saints

While watching the movie I was secretly wishing for someone to kill off the 2 bland brothers so the movie could end.  I'm all for violent, shoot'em up, curse filled movies but it should be done with orignality and with interesting characters.  Yeah, there are some cool pretentious action sequences but thats basically all that this movie has to offer. The movie tried to be hip and cool with the brothers reciting scripture just before they blow someone's head off but the only person who could do that with any style and with coolness oozing out his ears is bad ass Samuel L.

THE BEST MOVIE NO ONE'S SEEN,7,6 September 2002,"Had it not been for the tragedy at Columbine, this movie would have hit the country with a fury and Connor, Murphy, Rocco, and Il Duce would be household names.  Yes, it is a tragedy in itself that this movie did not receive the theatrical release it so well deserved.  After Columbine, anything involving guns and black overcoats was frowned upon, and so beings the story of the BOONDOCK SAINTS.  I bought this movie on advice from a friend who told me it was good.  GOOD, my friends, is an understatement.This movie follows the story of two Irish brothers living in an Irish neighborhood.  They are very religious and church-faring.  When they attend a sermon one day, about how a good man's indifference is just as bad as an evil man, it plants a seed in them.  Pretty soon the Russian mafia starts strong-arming their way into their neighborhood, our two brothers are left with only one choice, action, over indifference.  So the movie unfolds and we follow our brothers through a movie which is told in outstanding fashion. We get to see them many times getting ready for a huge action sequence, and then the movie cuts away and we see the crime scene afterwards being ran through by FBI agent Paul Smecker (Dafoe of Spiderman fame).  He examines each bloody scene and then tells the local police, and the audience just what transpired... and this is a real treat for us.  You have to just see these scenes unfold to truly appreciate them.  I have not quite seen another movie that unfolds quite like BDS and does it with such outstanding results!The other great thing about this movie is its dialog and acting.  There are some fantastic lines in this movie.  You will find yourself repeating them over and over again... ""where you going... NOWHERE!!!""  You will soon be chanting the family prayer and writing Aequitas and Veritas all over yourself or scratch paper whenever you get the chance... and this movie is sure to inspire a few tattoos. See it once and you'll know what I'm talking about. Once, however, is simply not enough.  Sean Patrick Flannery and Norman Reedus give outstanding performances and make us truly believe that they care for each other as brothers (toilet scene), and that they have a divine mandate to kill the killers.  The movie raises a good point... that we've all wished at one time or another that someone would ""take out the trash"" so to speak.  That's what Connor and Murphy excel at.   Without giving much more away, I want to just leave you with one final note...Upon purchasing this DVD about 3 weeks ago... my friends and I have watched BDS about 8 times!  This movie is truly one you will want to see over and over again... and when you factor in that the DVD from Fox can be purchased for around $12 it should be in everyone's collection.  It is one of the best action movies around, with the most style (rivaling pulp fiction) and best action around.  That tied in with its spiritual overtones, makes for one heck of a rollercoaster ride that you will want to see again and again.  I urge you to give Boondock Saints a chance.  It has risen to within my top 5 of all time, and I know you will not be disappointed. Finally... a sequel is in the making, so for all of you who have or plan on seeing BDS and haven't had enough... the whole clan should be back for another awesome flick in, Boondock II: The Second Coming! I know I'm excited!!!!",The Boondock Saints

I thought it would be a serious film about men who, driven by their strong moral feeling, i.e. desire for the happiness for good people and aversion for such people being harmed, will attempt a crusade against those who are obtaining wealth at the expense of other people sufferings, especially gangsters.I was wrong. The film is about two guys, who, not having a slightest moral feelings (in the above-mentioned sense), are suddenly mystically stuck with a idea of ""eradicating evil"" and with a fanatic joy are putting it into practice. In their minds it means to kill everyone who has a connection to crime activity. With the exception of their friend Rock who being himself a gangster, joins them to repay his boss and his fellow-gangsters for a set up. Him they love and never care that he is a scum and obviously lead by the selfish anger. They never bother themselves with a thorough selection of targets. A word from Rock, for example, is enough for them to visit the house he pointed and slain everyone inside. That even if they are killing gangsters there could be an undercover officer or debtor among them never come to their minds. While doing all this they are obviously having fun, getting especially exited when they are able to rob their victims.To sum it all up, the movie is about fanatics, motivated solely by the desire of putting their ideas into life. The same kind of motivation that now occupies so many people from Middle East. That this type of motivation can bear some resemblance to real moral will perhaps misled some to consider this movie as delivering moral message.

462,TheRisingCollective,Absolutely Brilliant,9,21 January 2007,"We all know Troy Duffy sucks at life. But give credit where credit is due: he came out with a great movie, and this movie has earned a score reserved for the likes Pulp Fiction, Forrest Gump, and Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind.The premise of this movie, first off, was very interesting. I like how it took on the issue of vigilantism and the blurry line between the law and taking the law into your own hands. It was a very thoughtful concept and a very impressive working ground for this film to base itself on.The acting, secondly, was pretty good. I wouldn't say every actor gave a powerhouse performance, but Willem Dafoe absolutely MADE this movie. He really took over his role with body gestures, tone, and grace. The two brothers were OK at their roles, not great, but enough to do the job. Unlike most people, I really thought the guy who played Rocco did a great job too. He did overact sometimes, but looking back at when he's telling the joke to Yakavetta, he made that scene what it was.In addition to a solid acting performance, it was assisted by good writing. Call Troy Duffy whatever you want, but he wrote a very well rounded film that blended comedy, action, and emotion. Me and my friends use some of these lines on a daily basis now. This script really carried this movie more than anything else.The soundtrack and soundtrack were also impressive. The opening track, The Blood Of Cuchulainn, is one of my favorite songs, period. I was very impressed with the way Duffy blended the epic soundtrack, the slow motion techniques, and camera placement. It really couldn't have been better the way it was shot and accompanied. Also, a nice bonus was the street interview ending. Absolutely brilliant placement.Three Good things about this Movie 1. Willem Dafoe was absolutely wonderful 2. Loads of fun little cult one-liners to say amongst your friends 3. It took its issue and really dealt with it Three Bad Things about this Movie 1. The two actors that played the brothers could have been a bit better 2. You didn't get a good hold on how much of a monster Il Duce actually was. 3. There were a couple scenes you kind of couldn't pick up what exactly was being said. Overall, a 10. I don't care what anyone else says about it. This movie was an absolutely great film and one of my personal favorites that I'd recommend to anyone not afraid of a little blood. Take care, guys.""Hey Greenly.

463,harish-dh,Boondock Saints is a must watch !,10,10 February 2007,"This action flick is about two brothers who swear by their principles to fight the scum who have grown to populate their city. It isn't like most mindless predictable car-crashing, Do-nut munching, crack trading gangster movies. The story isn't the big draw either- its the usual good vs evil preacher ideology. However, the style and panache with which most action sequences are shot combined with excellent dialog delivery is what makes it different. In fact every killing scene has an amazing musical score making it thoroughly exhilarating. The gay cop who has an intuitive talent of running through the event of massacre and who does so listening to an opera waving his hands in the air adds a dash of ecstasy to the gory manner of the murders. Its not bad on the dialog front either.. with the essential supplies of mindless crassiemathafakisms... This one truly is a gem and is in my opinion on the lines of pulp fiction and reservoir dogs..

As someone who has been studying film for years I screen a film differently than the average home viewer, but even when a film isn't coming together I try to enjoy it! I like to watch films succeed! This movie didn't work out at all. The direction and script were probably the hugest failures. Without terrible direction the acting might not have come across so misguided. William Defoe was horrible in this and his character was unpredictable and lacked any depth. Wish I had time to write up a complete explanation of why this film falls flat on it's face, but it's safe to say this movie isn't worth watching. It is unoriginal, predictable, and not half as good as most made for TV movies. I think this film has such high reviews because it struck a chord with the 15 year old kids who are watching a rated R movie for the first time. They seem to worship it as something unique. However, for grownups I would say this movie doesn't amount to much of anything and you shouldn't waste your time. DON""T BE FOOLED BY THE GOOD REVIEWS DONE BY TEENAGERS>>> THIS MOVIE IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME OR MONEY!",The Boondock Saints
465,drakenat-1,"Judging by other reviews, most people obviously don't get this film.",10,14 February 2010,"It seems like a lot of people simply don't get this film, and start to complain about pretty much every line and object in every scene about how much it sucked. While I agree it has some small flaws every now and then, the flaws that I'm thinking about are not the same that everyone that rated it 1/10 thinks of. Before you start watching this film (and you don't get it while watching it), you need to know that this is a movie that on purpose made to be over the top. The Irish are Irish, the stupid cops are often retarded, the homosexual is flaming etc, and to top it off they've got a message from god to go out and kill people. To explain further, this movie has the same kind of over-the-top, sometimes just bizarre, dark humor that you can see in for example Tarantinos Inglorious Basterds (a movie in which the name is even misspelled to further point out this phenomenon).While this movie is still kick ass action, it doesn't take itself too seriously. Its humoristic and brings up an, at the time of its release, very fresh angle on vigilantism. Its a real 'guy-movie', which I think is great being male myself and all that, but it probably wouldn't be the first nor second movie I would put on, should I be in female company.Cult status well earned.",The Boondock Saints

Troy Duffy goes from bartender to movie maker extrodinaire overnight by telling us a story that will stay with us for a lifetime.

467,SisterSquee,My obsession,10,10 August 2003,"The Boondock Saints is...a...well, I must admit that I actually have difficulty putting how I feel about this movie into words. It's just that good. I absolutely loved the way that it was filmed: the style is wonderful. I adore the cast--I don't care what other people say, I think Norman Reedus and Sean Patrick Flanery performed their parts as the MacManus brothers to perfection. Willem Dafoe is always cool, no more explanation needed there... And then Billy Connolly. Superb in the courtroom scene. What a presence.This movie goes much deeper than many believe, and the ethical question behind the film is one that I have pondered often since seeing this movie for the first time. How far should one be able to go to procure peace and safety for the multitudes? Should one be able to kill to achieve such a goal? This is why BDS is such a great film--it makes one think and prompts the audience to examine themselves, to see if they can come up with their own answers. I *highly* recommend it. Heck, just go and buy it, don't waste time and money renting it. ;) I know you'll want to keep it.",The Boondock Saints
468,rfsst11,A Flicker of Light In The Fading World of Film,10,1 August 2002,"In a day and age where CGI (special effects) enables film to go places that it has never gone before, but as a side effect to this has become the make or breaking point of many a film it is beautiful to see a film like ""The Boondock Saints"".  In a society and time like the one we live in where the movie star is catapulted, ready or not, into what we, the common man, have made ""celebrity"" status to be; sickening heights of worthlessness on which horrid films are able to make billions of dollars just because ""A-List"" celebrities are in them, it is beautiful to see a film like ""The Boondock Saints"".  This film shows that indeed there are still truly original film-makers out there.  The cookie cutter, how to make money, corporate americanized film industry has not touched this film, oh no.  ""The Boondock Saints"" is fresh, a deep breath of air in the polluted, self destructive, indunstry that is hollywood.  Thank God and Troy Duffy true film fans! Along with the likes of Christopher Nolan, M. Night Shyamalan, and most importantly the Coen brothers, Troy Duffy might just provide the kick in the butt that the common brain dead american needs to start appreciating great film.

469,BoondockSaint,The best.,10,14 December 2001,"The best movie you've never seen.  Love the cliche, but it's never been more true here.  If you're a fan of action movies and can tolerate harsh language than this is the movie for you.  Many people call this a ""Tarantino-Esque"" movie, which it could be, but even ""Reservoir Dogs"" pales in comparison to this movie.Tough to find, yes, but well worth the search.  Find it and enjoy!",The Boondock Saints
470,alltimebest,I don't get the hate...,7,2 October 2011,"There seems to be quite a bit of hate among the user reviews. Mostly to the tune of not only insulting the film but insulting the intelligence of those that do enjoy it.This is most certainly not the best movie I've ever seen nor does it deserve the praise as one of the ""greats"" because this doesn't even crack my top 20 action movies.All that being considered, you have to look at many things. Every character in this movie is clearly meant to be a caricature, hence their extreme outlandishness. Secondly, no matter what your feelings on religion in general it is perfectly reasonable for it to exist and be quite real in the world of a film (while I don't think that was the intention films are open for interpretation). So that being said the scene where they fall from the vent and make 8 extremely well placed shots, and the voice-over of scripture(I believe it is scripture) says as much, can be taken that they are actually being protected by their faith.Moving on, most of the complaints ring pretty true. The acting is average at best, the brothers accents sound like the lucky charms leprechaun, the dialogue is idiotic, the whole flashback to the murders gets old, and it has plenty of glaring plot-holes. However, I do find the movie entertaining for the most part, particularly the scene where Willem Dafoe's character is ""there"" while he recounts the poker game murders. If only for the same reason that I am able to enjoy any popcorn film (like say Transformers), because after I watch a heavy film (ex. 2001, Apocalypse Now, Manchurian Candidate(1962), the list could go on and on) I enjoy watching something less involving.I would have to say this movie is a 6/10. It's far from the worst I've ever seen or even the worst ever made. Anyone that says so has clearly never heard of Mystery Science Theater 3000 haha(yes those are real movies). This is not a must see, I could easily come up with 100 other movies you should invest time in before this one, but it is fun if you can give you're discerning film loving mind a rest for about 2 hours.If you've read this far forgive me. This is my first review and I did not give much time for compiling my thoughts and just wrote.",The Boondock Saints
471,SebNeub,A proof that movie still IS art,10,7 March 2002,"As I said, this movie IS art. Along with this comes a high entertainment-level and some suspense, in some cases. The characters of the two brothers are really cool, you like them the first minute you see them. But the real main character is the gay FBI agent Smecker, whose role playing is really above all others. This movie shows all the coolness normal people can only dream of. Billy Connolly as the Killer-killer is also a great choice. The pictures and the music are truly good, the story that is told is a bit too crazy - so what? If you haven´t seen this masterpiece of film, get it now, rent it, buy it, see it!! The idea, that you first see what the police sees, and then get told what really happened is something new, I think. Troy Duffy should make more of this style.",The Boondock Saints

Again, a very funny film with some scenes being as good as any you will see in any other film (Willem Dafoe ""walking through"" one of the shootings with the protagonists).NOT fascist, not for bottomfeeders, possibly not for ottowans - eh, allmypeople? (see previous review) But, as with all subjective media, it's all down to personal taste - I think most of the Star Wars films are dog kack, love this film and zoolander and think Keanu is the antichrist (except for the Matrix where he was merely Teak!)Cheers Ears!

Like others have stated the story isn't that well thought of either,two brothers out to rid the world in the name of god? I really enjoy Willem Dafoe in most of his movies, but he just comes off as irritating here. Don't want to bring up ""Pulp Fiction"", I just feel that this movie tries to take a lot from it.

474,Dajur1,Great Movie,10,23 January 2003,"What a great movie!  Everything about this movie rocks.  The characters aren't too complex that they get in the way of the plot, and they aren't too simple that we don't care about them.  Speaking of plot, what could be better than a couple of guys who just decide to kill all the evil people in the world?  I've thought about it before, haven't you?  The only thing that I find to be a little odd is that if you look at the credits, the actor who plays David Della ""Funny Man/Roc"" Rocco isn't playing anyone else at all. Apparently that is his real name.  Anyway, throughout all the extensive (but well played) violence, I was able to suspend my disbelief and really enjoy the movie.  Some people have compared this movie to a tarantino film, but Tarantino doesn't have nothin' on this movie.  This film is quality through and through, not like that half-wit garbage Tarantino pumps out.  So if you want to watch a Tarantino type movie, I suggest you go rent ""Switchblade Sisters"" and leave Boondock Saints for someone who can appreciate a good flick when he/she sees it.""Destroy all that which is evil, so that which is good may flourish - Boondock Saints""",The Boondock Saints
475,allmypeople,This film is fascist,1,27 May 2002,"Hopefully no young people will ever see this horribly bad movie. My friends and I could hardly stop laughing throughout this dim-witted movie. This is a movie that appeals to disgusting bottom-feeders. You can tell that the person who wrote it never graduated high school.The acting is sooo bad. Willem Defoe, listening to music, while walking around the crime scene, at the beginning of the movie, was almost worth seeing this garbage: You will laugh so hard your stomach will hurt. Actually, there's another crime scene investigation, almost as funny as the first: Defoe gets so worked up that he sweats, tears his shirt and fires his gun in the air- AT A CRIME SCENE! My friends and I laughed so hard we were all crying. It was so bad.Even the action scenes are so ridiculous that people stand in plain view, 15 feet away of each other, shoot for 30 seconds straight and no one gets shot! Also the 'saints/nazis' walk in to a courthouse with guns by throwing the bag that's carrying them over a metal detector! It's so stupid that it's hilarious!The writing is horrible! You can tell that troy duffy isn't a very intelligent person. He believes...get this (LOL!): that having people go around killing drug dealers, etc, is a good thing! He obviously has never read any books on poverty or crime. As I mentioned earlier, there's a scene where they walk into a courthouse... Well, this movie is so dumb that the 'saints/nazis' kill the accused BEFORE the verdict is even read!! I'm laughing even as I write this!Ok, on the theme: I'll get serious for a second and say that this movie would be supported by neo-nazis. They'd love the message in this film.That's one of the main reasons why I think this is one of the worst movies ever made.

478,bobonbass,I finally found this movie.... and WOW!,10,15 July 2002,"I have been hearing a lot about this flick over and over from the 3-D gaming community that my brother is involved in. Finally I have been able to view it. The Boondock Saints quickly held place in my top 10 favorite movies. It has it's quirks, such as many indy flicks do, but the good greatly outweighes the bad. Everyone whom I have shown this film to (practically everyone that I watch movies with) has absolutely loved this movie. Even the guy who watches any generic Hollywood mindless dime-a-dozen action movie will LOVE this movie.There are those movies that either you love or hate. This isn't one of those though.... EVERYONE loves this movie. Well maybe not the people who don't like to realize how much the word f**k is used in life, they wouldn't like it. But everyone else will. I cannot recommend another film any higher to the general masses of ""R"" rated film viewers. The Boondock Saints is deffinately not for children though obviously.I haven't been entertained so well in a 2 hour time period for a long while. The movie contains down right goofyness for humor as well as witty dialog for it's charm. It respectfully plays out it's action scenes better than any independant film I have seen in years. Separating this movie visually from a high budget Hollywood action film is the use of only a few cameras in each scene as opposed to the glossy multi-camera editing of it's high dollar counterparts. The only thing missing from this movie is the sappy love story that a big budget movie would try to cram into any movie.In 1999 The Boondock Saints was scheduled to be released in the USA the Friday following the massacre at Columbine High School. The film was never released domestically, but was released to an international audience with much acclaim. I am not sure when it was released on VHS in the US, but the DVD has been sold out week after week in stores after it's release in may of 2002. As I wrote earlier, I knew of this movie shortly after it's international release and never really sought it out.

Big mistake.  The negative reviews are a spot-on match.  The acting itself is horrible, and the plot makes no sense.  The whole premise of the movie is that these brothers or ""saints"" are trying to rid the streets of evil.  Now it is easy to understand if you kill innocent people, that is wrong, but what about going to a strip club? Is that evil too?  I don't want to be judged by two brothers cracked out on a power hungry drunken binge. How does this make sense for all of the fans?  I seem to recall one of the commandments that states something like ""thou shalt not kill"" well then these brothers must have slept through that part of their heavily religious upbringing.

As soon as the final credits roled I felt it was my duty to speak up.  This movie SUCKED!!!  I couldn't believe what I had just witnessed...a terrible script (with holes so wide you could drive a truck through it), incredibly bad acting (especially Rocco and the Russian mobster who had his ass bandaged), poor action scenes (why the slow motion?), and some of the worst Irish accents I have ever heard.  The next day I went to IMDB to see what the masses had to say.  I was stunned to see such a high rating.  I thought there was something wrong with ME so I went back and watched this movie again.  Much to my surprise I did find two redeeming qualities in this flick.  The first was when the cat got his head blown off and the second was when Rocco bit the dust (no sequel for him).

I'm from Boston, I like action flicks and the premise sounded like it could be promising -- so I figured I'd risk the rental.It is absolutely one of the best films I've seen -- ever.It takes a fair amount of sophistication to develop characters, no matter what kind of director you are: even with big-budget films, there's no such guarantee.  It also takes a lot to keep the audience guessing as what is going to happen next -- so many films of guilty of telegraphing what's going to happen next.  This film commits neither faux pas, and also manages to inject novel plot twists and utter hysteria into the mix, as well.
Willem Dafoe is an outrageously over-the-top investigator; Sean Patrick Flanery is totally believable as a principled Irish gangster, and Norman Reedus as his younger, gentler brother.  The opening scene is great; the action is pretty fast, although you'd be surprised at how little actual gore is shown.

I certainly recommend giving it a try, and seeing for yourself what camp you fall into. At worst, you waste an hour and a half. You can even watch it for free on YouTube, so you don't have to waste your money. My main warning is that the R rating is certainly earned, by both language and violence. Some of the pluses? The characters. The relationship of the brothers - they are rowdy and boyish and great partners. While they can be serious, they can be lighthearted a moment later. And very fun accents to listen to! Willem Dafoe's character - completely over the top, but great to watch. I like him better here than I do as the Green Goblin. Others find Rocco very amusing, though I'm not personally such a fan. Doc, the older bartender with Teretz, is more amusing to me. The fantasy. Wouldn't it be nice if someone could just take care of all the scumbags out there? The vigilante theme hits a chord. While I don't know of anyone who would take this seriously (ie, go out and start shooting people), there's enough to it to find appealing in the context of the movie. The storytelling. I really enjoy the out-of-sequence scenes as a way to keep the parallel stories of the law enforcement and the brothers interwoven. Smecker becomes more and more involved over the course of the film, and this device makes that happen. The soundtrack. Some great music! The drawbacks?Don't expect well-sketched villains. These are caricatures of the mob. I liked Papa Joe most of the time, but still. Language. I'm sorry, but when you have to use the F-word 250 times, that's overdone. There were times it was amusing or relevant, but not in every f'in line. See? Completely unnecessary. It loses its effect when you don't save it for its intensity. Morality. The attempt to justify the film's actions are not terribly...convincing. At least Smecker was supposed to be drunk/hungover while delivering those lines! The brothers convince their best friend to switch from 'you're crazy!' to 'you should recruit!' in a matter of minutes, suggesting that everyone's convictions are rather shallow. After all, they're not exactly saints themselves...just not mobsters. I think a lot of people are uneasy that the movie doesn't try harder to condemn vigilantism. This is *not* The Oxbow Incident!I love the movie, at the end of the day. I'm a 30 year old woman who doesn't curse or have tattoos. Just sayin'.

The scenes are put together in a way that isn't normally done. Not backwards from last to first, but each event is done in a backwards fashion, which gives it a nice feel to it. There are a few unexpected twists throughout that aren't a big deal, but not forseeable. The last 10 minutes though is a mind boggler. I also loved that it is a movie truly meant for the sequel (due in 2003) which I am going to see in the theater on opening day, post haste.

The two impressions heavily differed one from another. This time I've noticed many flaws on many levels of this flick. First ,the storyline is very thin. The message this story tried to carry out is,I suppose, the influence that media (even the preachings as a form of media) can have on individual(s)... So to wrap that message in commercial package our storytellers came up with a 'heroic avenger'(x2)... O, there is a religious allegory implemented as well (some of it's elements are handcuff-made-stigmata, holy water dripping from jail ceiling , pre-execution prayers...and so on). Bringing the Justice by killing heaps of 'bad guys' with 'rage and vengeance in heart' and all that with no tactics nor plot? Sorry-it's already been seen and is very thin... Second...physics. e.g. Fall from the fifth floor? Rambo shootouts(firs killing 10 mobsters with 10 bullets,but later on missing at least 100 bullets aimed at horrid 'Duke'(who also cant shoot?)...wright. Third...acting is a bit unbalanced,probably because some roles lack characters finesse(except for Willem Dafoe who skillfully managed to improve his role of 'Paul Smecker' ). Four... the story composition could be better led,with some shifts in rhythm which would enable (no not enable-create )a strong(er) catharsis... But I've liked it before?

Granted, the influences are good (the aforementioned Guy Ritchie and Scorsese), but too obvious, and the film brings nothing new to the table. It only comes to show that when you're dealing with a time-honored genre like this, you better be able to hold your own. And the makers of this film don't. While the first 45 minutes still seem to deserve the benefit of the doubt, and there are some nice things about the film (Willem Dafoe's flamboyant character, specially), it is clear after the confessional booth scene that the plot is going nowhere.

492,rjmungall-1,Religious extremists go on rampage..,2,7 February 2009,"For a general review or synopsis of the film, please see other reviews. This review is to add some important points that I have not seen written or very well articulated.In many ways the film is poorly done, the lines are cheesy, the plot is repetitive, but I can take all that for something great behind it all.. but this is about as bad as a movie can get since, in addition, it's foundation is senseless in the worst way.What way? Well, it glorifies religious extremism, and I want to expand on that beyond it's brief mention by other reviewers. This premise of religious extremism COULD be good if it were properly treated, but it wasn't treated at all. In fact, this movie is straight up dishonest because it made no attempt to be CRITICAL or take the premise anywhere at all. Yet there are so many subjects opened up in this film: notions of judgment, and Judgement, punishment, good vs. evil (and whether such a distinction should be made in the first place), religion, fundamentalism, etc etc etc... SO much material here.. yet it doesn't deal with ANY of it! Seriously, are they kidding? In fact, if any of the themes of the premise were investigated thoroughly, it might have even been.. good.What ideals are being sold here? What are young minds (like mine was the first time I saw it) going to take away from it? Well, obviously, it glorifies violent extremism. Perhaps those who like the movie like it because it's their side, the ""right"" side, that is glorified. That this makes it OK? That makes you not question it? What IS it? For those of you who love this film, ask yourself how you feel about Jihadists, or other extremists. I'll bet if this film was done EXACTLY the same, but with two Muslim men trying to get rid of the evils of capitalism by killing CEOs, or whatever, you'd be in a rage. You'd spend the whole movie wishing they were caught and then slowly murdered in full cinematic detail.I'm not religious, I'm don't think that swearing or other trivial things are ""bad"", and normally stuff like this doesn't bother me.

The acting is terrible, it is so cheesy its ridiculous and the only reason Willem Dafoe took this role was for the money because even he is terrible in it. The lead roles have THE WORST Irish accents I have ever heard in a movie, they sound like Leprechauns with Scottish, American, Australian and South African twangs, absolutely cringeworthy. I was told that this was a great movie and a cult classic. Oh my God please tell me this was a joke. If Marlon Brando had used an African accent as Don Corleone in The Godfather it would have been slated. This was a shambles of a movie and the acting and script is terrible. If you think this movie is anyway half decent then please pass me some of whatever you're smoking, because this is a disaster. 1 out of 10 only because I had to give a mark.",The Boondock Saints

Crazy, lazy, seriously by the way they see what they do, selected killer brothers (Connor and Murphy), and a goofy assistant (Rocco). If it were more bloody I should say: It's a Quentin Tarantino/ Robert Rodriguez movie. Quite a surprise when I watched it in 2009. Didn't know what I was missing up to then. A brilliant performance by Willem Dafoe (detective Smecker)was a great added value for the final result. Comparable perhaps to «Crank», for the speed, the insanity, and the frequent turn overs, I suggest everyone to dedicate less than 2 hours an rejoice this piece.

So I now know what everything means in it.Really, it's a dark comedy that plays at the structure of people's morals, and is bound to make some people angry.  Watch Willem DaFoe's investigator character in this movie.  A truly well written and well acted part (with the exception of one clip at a crime scene, directed more for affect, which was actually kind of cool).Some dialogue can be drawn out, but is fun anyway.

499,stumblefoot,Non-linear storytelling executed well,8,28 July 2003,"I've always enjoyed non-linear storytelling.  A number of people seem to have picked up on this aspect of the movie and thus dubbed it similar to Pulp Fiction (though no one mentions Reservoir Dogs) when this movie takes non-linear storytelling to a level beyond where Quentin Tarrantino was ever able to go.Now, certainly Memento came along afterwards and transformed the entire art of non-linear storytelling.  However, Memento uses it to keep the movie watcher guessing until the very end, whereas Boondock Saints puts the pieces on the table, letting you try to put them together, but then will continue handing you pieces until the picture becomes clearer.Clearly the movie is designed to be over-the-top, both from Williem Dafoe's character to the action sequences themselves.  Williem Dafoe makes this movie for me.  The plot, which centers on religiously-inspired vigilante justice, has an air of being somewhat cliched, although I would be hard pressed to name another movie which handles it in this matter.I still fail to see how others consider this movie vacuous and without meaning, when its message about the pitfalls of our current legal system and the need for something that transcends it is quite clear.  I thought the ending, in which various people are interviewed about their opinion of the ""Saints"" and how for some vigilante justice was an incredibly sensitive issue, made this point very clear.",The Boondock Saints
500,saint_icarus,Indie gem gets shafted...,9,18 March 2003,"The Boondock Saints is a little independent gem, the first attempt from producer/director Troy Duffy.  Some people may not like the film because there are comparisons with Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. Perhaps they don't know that Duffy's film, which was coming out in the aftermath of the Columbine tragedy, was annihilated by the ratings board and was panned by critics for its gratuitous violence.  The film you watch is very different from the one Duffy had in mind, and is missing many key elements in the shootouts, for instance, that allow those comparisons to be made. Even still, you shouldn't expect this to be a Tarantino movie, because Quentin didn't make it.  What you should expect is a very fun and highly entertaining movie that challenges your personal moral debates on the lesser of two evils and vigilante justice.  Get over the fact that Duffy isn't the kind of writer Tarantino is, and that he made the film on a low budget, and that the ratings board drastically altered the film's final cut, and you can really appreciate the movie.  This movie is quickly gaining a sort of ""cult classic"", at least among college students, and is certainly one of my favorite movies to watch.

505,ginga1,One of the best movies ever,8,24 May 2003,This movie is one of the best I´ve ever seen. That´s my opinion. I really like it because Troy Duffy found a very fascinating way to show a movie. There are those scenes where you see Dafoe explaining the crime and after that you see that happen what Dafoe just said before. I think this is a very creative way to tell a story. Then there are the action scenes. They are fantastic. The McManus Brothers or Rocco don´t jump around and make this kung fu thing like in Matrix but that isn´t important. The action scenes look great. There are many people who say that the action scenes look like a John Woo movie. Why? Because there is slow motion? There are so many movies where slow motion is used but why does everybody say that Boondock Saints is like a John Woo film. I know Woo made the slow motion thing popular but I think Boondock Saints has its own style so don´t compare it with John Woo films and don´t say that Troy Duffy stole this slow motion thing because he has not his own ideas. If you want to do this look at Matrix. Everything in this movie was stolen from other movies.And you can clearly see that you don´t need hundred millions of dollars to make a good movie. I think Troy had about 5 to 6 Million Dollars to make this movie. And he did a very very good job.And please don´t think that I don´t like John Woo. He is one of the best action movie directors of the world. And don´t think I don´t like matrix. I just don´t like the first Matrix movie. But Matrix Reloaded will be very good.It is also my opinion. Everyone who doesn´t like Boondock Saints is ok and everyone who likes it is also ok. This is just MY OPINION. and so I LIKE THIS MOVIE!,The Boondock Saints

Shallowness beside, the very concept of the movie was amazing. It's not just one of those movies about mindless and graphic violence, it has a clear MESSAGE that's plainly beautiful to everyone, even those who don't agree with the message. The filming techniques, too, with the style of flashbacks, creates a thrilling movie experience overall.

513,ScootRose,An exercise in Puerility,1,4 November 2003,"I feel film deserves to be regarded as an art form on level with music and literature. If this is the case, Boondock Saints is the Nelly and Harry Potter of the film world in its intense popularity in the face of its undeniable lack of any redemptive depth of intellectual appeal. Pretence is the name of the game as far as this stinker is concerned and it fails in several regards: Plot, acting/writing, and direction. Basically everything that matters in a movie, this flick doesn't have. As far as the plot goes I have three big beefs (be forewarned, I will probably disclose elements of the paltry plotlines in this review):1) The two brothers are devout Catholics, but spend most of the movie cursing and killing which are decidedly nonChristian activities. I hate to nitpick, but the Christian element is such a big part of the story that you can't help but question the dubiousness of ending your prayers not with `Amen' but with shooting someone's face off. 2) The entire moral element, which forms the basis of appeal for this movie, is compromised by the fact that the retribution is effected through unrepentant mass murder. Practicing Christians like the characters in Boondock Saints ought to remember that `vengeance is the Lord's' and anyone with a brain ought to realize that there's no moral lesson in killing. 3) The whole storyline is a big can of creamed corn. From the pointlessly gay detective joining forces with the vigilantes, to the mafia's secret weapon (seeming pulled out of the Troy Duffy's butt halfway through the script), to the fact that he's their father, to the ending courtroom scene, this is unmitigatedly corny.When it comes to the writing Troy Duffy and basically every actor needs to learn the lesson that incessant screaming does not constitute dialogue. This seems perfectly obvious and yet it seems that when the boys aren't killing something they're screaming their lungs out about something else. And when neither of these is occurring, we are beholden to vapid attempts a witty dialogue, the punch lines to which can be sited from miles away. As for the direction, Duffy could stand to learn much regarding what I've already touched on, but I may as well mention the incessant awkwardness of so much of this movie. There's the pointless confessional booth scene, the cat scene (see `Pulp Fiction'), Willem Dafoe's dancing (and seduction of men), basically everything is awkward and mindless in this crapfest.Anyone, religious or not, ought to recognize the internal contradiction of the entire premise this movie based on. To make matters worse it isn't well acted, well written, or even edited well.Do yourself a favor and temper your cinematic taste with the tried and true: Casablanca for the fantastic dialogue, Annie Hall for the humor, Citizen Kane for the direction, Lawrence of Arabia for the visuals, The Sting for the flawless delivery, the world of film has so much more to offer. Watch any of these, then come back and see what you think about the latest flavor of the week movie.",The Boondock Saints

515,slickwombat7,mostly B-grade,5,12 January 2004,"Despite a few isolated moments of brilliance (the toilet-dropping scene comes to mind) this is mainly just a confused, silly, poorly-written attempt at a quirky Guy Ritchie/Tarantino style action movie. It would perhaps work as parody of that genre, except that there's no sense of underlying wit or irony.Among the film's more outstanding flaws:Characters are generally not believable as either the ethnic stereotypes they're supposed to embody, nor as human beings in general. Accents are for the most part very poorly done. One side-effect of this is that the ""bad guys"" don't really seem very bad or evil at all; the mafiosi in UHF were more believable as such. I would probably have assumed they were all out-of-work comedians if the movie didn't have all sorts of helpful captions explaining their mobster status.Motivations are obscure or inconsistent. Supposedly, the two brothers believe they are on a divine quest to rid the world of organized crime, yet their best friend is a low-level mobster. They engage in solemn ritualistic murder, yet moments later act like slap-happy, carefree children, wrestling and playing practical jokes. They come off more like amiable psychopaths than as heroes, although we're apparently supposed to see them as the latter.There are numerous plot inconsistencies and omissions. It's difficult to detail these without rampant spoilers, but suffice it to say that the police response time in Boston, even to a federal courthouse, must be something like three hours.This movie tries very hard to be funny, but frequently misses the mark or degrades into camp. Ron Jeremy as a gangster Elvis impersonator would be an example, or Willem Dafoe's crossdressing.The film does have some things going for it, notably Willem Dafoe (despite some of the horrific things he's made to do), some cool action scenes, and the occasional bit of genuinely funny dialogue.

517,TiB014,Saints among men,10,22 November 2006,"This movie is fantastic! That said, I'll go into the correct diversions I ought to route into.First, the movie is fantastic. I know I just said that, but let me prove it. It is an artistic movie. How many artistic action movies are there? In my opinion, this rivals ""Resevoir Dogs"" in terms of good action/dramatic/artistic movies. The juxtaposition of the scenes of action and exposition are played beautifully, and actually make the movie more fun -- for example, as the police try to figure out what happened and decide on a theory, we flashback to what actually happened.Second, it is acted beautifully. Perhaps with a script as good as this, it's easier, I don't know. My only experience with a script half as good as this is was on stage, and nothing I could have done could have messed up the character of Doc O'Connor (in ""The Laramie Project"" FYI... and yes, Buscemi played it better...). Billy Connolly (sp?) is amazing. My only other views of him before this came in ""Lemony Snicket..."" and on a ""Daily Show"" interview promoting his new comedy act. The brothers played their parts wonderfully, in fact nearly in synchronization. I in fact asked my friend how long she suspected they rehearsed that relationship to get it just right.Third, the morals. I believe whole-heartedly in the messages of this movie. Yes, not message, messages. To reveal them here would ruin the movie for those of you who have not seen it.Suffice it to say, this movie is awesome. I hate to sound like a teenage dumbass, but you can't quite gather how good of a movie this is until you see it.If I had to go negative, the only bad thing I can think of is that it is too short.

527,stepmainiac,What an utter disaster of a film...,1,6 January 2005,"First and foremost this film is morally repugnant, especially for it's interpretation of what is religiously moral and it's fake ""street interviews"" at the end. A calculated but ham fisted way to pretend that this film speaks for common folk.But getting beneath that, this film is a train wreck.Terrible cartoonish characterizations. Overblown acting. Gaping plot holes. Troy Duffy desperately wants to be Quentin Tarantino, but he is frankly not clever enough. The film looks alright, and the editing is almost as good as you would expect from a first film, but largely it's a gimmick film and a derivative one at that.Duffy clearly has an agenda (and a pretty crappy worldview.) I think he would be well served to learn more about the world before he creates propaganda on how to fix it.Lord help us that he is making a sequel.",The Boondock Saints
528,tiny_tangerine,I highly recommend this movie.,9,19 January 2005,"This movie is, simply put, very fun to watch. There's a nice big chunk of a morality issue that you can chew on long after the end credits roll, and it was very well presented. The only thing that really bothered me was the plot holes. Certain things, logically shouldn't have happened which would negate the entire reason for the movie to continue. Why would they have the Russians pager if they put all of his stuff into a bag and gave it to the bartender? Why would the Russian mob still call the pager and give the necessary information when the story had already leaked to the press. I'm sure even the Russian mob reads the paper. But other than that, I thought the acting was swell, and they made a sub-par script come together nice and neat. Props to Troy Duffy, though, for making it work. Conveying religious undertones without getting cheesy or over-worked is a hard thing to do. Watch this film, watch it many, many times.",The Boondock Saints

The sense of morality they possessed was a type that I wish more people had. Flannery was brilliant, and a crucial supporting character. The twist also was unexpected. I'm glad the previews didn't give anything away in this movie I would put in the top 10 that i have ever seen. I wasn't even going to watch this movie until I saw the recent film *four brothers*, afterwhich, my friend suggested the boondock saints. I have also heard it suggested by other friends and unlike one of the shmucks before me, i didn't watch it with a bunch of friends that ruined it.

Besides the fact that Norman Reedus is awesome, and I knew that before The Walking Dead, the movie is just fantastic! It is so different than anything I've seen. I thought director Troy Duffy did a great job and loved the way the scenes were shot with the flamboyant Det. Paul Smecker as he is investigating, first seeing the evidence, then describing miraculously visualizing how it all went down in the crime scene. William Dafoe was hilarious. My favorite scene was when they dropped out of the ceiling to take down the Russian mob! Batman who? These two guys are the best vigilantes and they don't wear tights or need a cape! I also really liked Funny Guy Rocco even though he did shoot the poor cat! It was an accident!Veritas Aequitas!",The Boondock Saints
532,AHBatz,A well made movie with a terrible message.,2,17 February 2006,"I watched this movie a few weeks ago and boy was it terrible.First off the two main characters are pretty hard to relate to. They are extremely religious, Irish, fraternal twins. Religious to the point of tattoos in Latin. And of course, they are vigilantes. With all the evil in the world they chose to take down the mafia. And being vigilantes they decide that the best way to do this is to kill them all.Another character is the expert crime scene investigator played by William Defoe. He is incredibly smart and seemingly perfect at his job. The real problem with him is that near the end of the movie he turns to the side of the Irish brothers. ""Why,"" I asked myself "",would he turn to the side of the religious Irish vigilantes?"" Because his messed up priest told him to! Another thing I found disturbingly wrong with this movie, is how the brothers preform a weird ritual that involves pennies and a prayer for every criminal they murder. As if they really care about the people that much! They also seem to be trying to prove a point that killing bad people is good when linked to religion. The movie tells us the lie that two wrongs make a right.Don't see this movie unless you like to rant or you don't care about the mental message the movie tries to show.Thank you!",The Boondock Saints

Wonderful performances from William Dafoe,Billy Connelly, Sean Patric Flannery, Norman reedus and David della Rocco plus the wonderful script it gelled so well. Second the styalized violence used in the film characterized what the brothers were trying to accomplish.

It is the worst movie I have ever seen. The only people that have ever said anything positive about this movie have been highschoolers that don't know anything about cinema.This movie isn't entertaining to me, but that's a subjective claim. This movie also happens to be completely unoriginal. It's about vigilante justice (70s crime movies anyone? Dirty Harry? French Connection? They all do it better.). It's about Irish-Catholic violence in Boston (even though it came afterwards, Gangs of New York portrays this theme more powerfully). It has characters marked with meaningful tattooes (Belly, Memento). It includes a cross-dressing detective (David Duchovny in Twin Peaks? What was that, 15 years earlier?). It depicts prayers before murder (Godfather Trilogy, Pulp Fiction). This movie was so unremarkable and derivative that I can't even remember more things to criticize.On a final note, it's just not a cool movie. The things that the filmmakers and the appreciative audiences think are cool are just not. The violence is sluggishly portrayed. The gay detective is just a caricature of an emphatic queen (unlike Gay Perry in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). The whole movie sucks.

It raises a good point, has great characters/actors and it is just a well plotted and well performed movie. It's entertaining and exhilarating at the same time. This is a movie that I watch over and over again and never get tired of it. Someone posted that this is a testosterone film and for guys only, I totally disagree. I'm a chick. I like chick flicks too. BUT, this has to be one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time, so it really isn't a man-movie.

The action along with the snappy dialog, Irish accent, humor and the nice filming made it so much more then ordinary.The actors were perfect for their roles IMO and made this movie what it is.

537,iain-111,"Don't listen to the ""cult classic"" hype",2,21 November 2005,"It's lucky for Troy Duffy that he managed to sabotage his own production and ensure that his film developed a reputation that preceded itself, if it had been released and judged on its merits alone then it's highly likely this film would have slithered off into obscurity mere weeks after its release.From the shoddy acting to the pretentious tacked on biblical aspect of the plot everything about this film displays a writer and director with far more ambition than talent. The script isn't funny in places where it's intended to be, but is absolutely hilarious when it's being serious. In terms of production Duffy tries to throw gritty gangster film in with stylish action movie but just ends up with scenes that don't flow together at all. The overused ""fade to black"" cuts between scenes don't help this problem in the slightest, in fact all they manage is to remind the viewer of an episode of Law & Order. Even the subtitles on this film are badly designed.However none of this is the worse aspect of the film, that honour must go to the characterisation. The overblown New York cop and mafia persona's combined with stereotypically Irish drunks give the impression of NYPD blue crossed with an episode of Father Ted, the Irish bar owner in particular is a direct rip off of Father Jack. On top of this the Irish accents of the two main characters are awful. The attempts at adding quirkiness to most of the characters are cack-handed at best and simply makes them seem unbelievable and at times embarrassing to watch.The only possible saving grace for The Boondock Saints is the plot idea of not showing the various set pieces within the standard chronology of the narrative but only revealing them after the detectives have theorised on what happened. However, the makers obviously exhausted their creativity with this trick and the continuous repetition of what might have otherwise been an interesting plot device just kills it's novelty and leaves the middle of the film languishing with no real direction.If you do have the misfortune to see this film then I highly recommend watching the documentary of it's production (Overnight, 2003) afterwards, as the funniest thing about this atrocious piece of cinema is the utterly misplaced egotism of it's creator.",The Boondock Saints

The photography's cool, the direction is sure and generally the production values are very good. I wasn't too convinced by Dafoe's character though; I think he played it a bit too tongue in cheek (no pun intended).My only disappointment is the way Troy Duffy, who wrote and directed it, has managed to ruin his chances in the movie biz by behaving like such an ASS!!

I finally decided to rent it this past Saturday. I must say, I enjoyed it and will definitely be adding it to my DVD collection. The action sequences are very well done and entertaining and really keep the film going.However, there are a lot of things in this movie that really did not make much sense to me. First of all, I don't understand why these two Irish brothers suddenly decide to become vigilantes. They kill two Russian mobsters in self defense then make a desicion to wage an all out war on crime. It just seemed kind of out-of-the-blue to me. Another thing is that how could two meat factory workers become cold-blooded, sharpshooting, professional killers in a matter of a few days? And also, Wilem Defoe is the most unconvincing woman I have ever seen.Other than those story flaws, I thought it was an immensely entertaining movie with good performances all around.

Only the language puts it over the edge for some people. The moral message is unmistakable, and it even highlights the very real problems we are currently facing in our judicial system. The action is great. Your typical ""shoot-em-up"" element is very much there, but mixed with a comic premise (which is also very much there), it becomes 10x better than either of those elements alone. The only element present in the film with which I disagree is the allegorical. Even as ""typical"" Irish-Catholic brothers, I didn't think it was best to show them getting drunk, cussing, and smoking all through the movie. This is not to say that I think killing people is any more or less ""christian,"" or that I disagree with a ""christian"" element in the film entirely. I am only saying that given the set of circumstances, their ""mission"" could have stood alone without casting the brothers in a bad light of their own.",The Boondock Saints

I watched the movie twice in two days. I couldn't help myself. Even the ending wasn't so much as intense on the screen as the mental intensity I mentioned before.

Entertainment in the tradition of ""Pulp Fiction"".",9,15 August 1999,"Preliminary remark: the comments refer to a pre-release version that was shown at the ""Fantasy Film Festival"" in Cologne, Germany, in August 1999.""Boondock Saints"" is a clever, funny, sufficiently violent movie with an overall high entertainment value. The story revolves around two Irish-American brothers and an excentric gay FBI agent (awesome: William Dafoe). The brothers - devout Catholics - who speak several languages fluently and work in a slaughterhouse find themselves equipped with money and weapons and subsequently start their very own crusade against the evil men of Boston - professional killers, mafia bosses and drug dealers. The agent is at their heels from the outset, but he has to realize that justice is on the side of the brothers...This basic plot is the foundation for a highly energetic narrative: we get excellent and at times highly comic dialogues (with a high F***-word ratio), running gags, and lots of crazy situations and plot developments that are as absurd as they are funny. The action/shooting scenes are well-choreographed with a fine eye for the detail, but it's the main characters, their dialogues and developments around which the movie is develops rather than the action sequences.On top of this, we get a fractured time/place structure that's already familiar from movies such as Kubrick's ""The Killing"" or Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"", but ""Boondock Saints"" takes it to new extremes - and thus it's fun to watch.Of course, the characters are a bit shallow every now and then and one would love to learn more about their background, but that's only a slight criticism.

It didn't know what it wanted to be, funny, ironic, serious, poignant - it was none of these. It was insulting on so many levels.You need to be able to relate or empathize with a character in a film, preferably one of the main characters. These were all horrible, e.g. the brothers; and watching the Funny Man character was like sticking a knife in your ear. After the shootout scene where The Funny Man gets his finger shot off and Bill Connelly manages not to get hit with one bullet, I couldn't watch it anymore. I caught glimpses of the rest of the film,Willem DeFoe cross-dressing, (you would think he could have shaved his sideburns off), just horrible.

The fast moving action plot creates a feeling of suspense and conflict as Agent Smecker gradually confronts his own personal dilemma - whether to arrest the two young men, who are eliminating known criminals, or look the other way and condone their ""illegal"" brand of justice.A surprise twist in the plot gives added credibility to the brothers and their mission to protect society from evil forces.  However, a clever ending ultimately leaves Agent Smecker's dilemma in the hands of the film viewer.I found the film exciting and thought provoking. The use of flashbacks from various crime scenes, to reveal the actual events of the crimes is very powerful.

The story really makes you think, the characters are very likable and intriguing, and the direction was superb.Although it does have many obvious references to Tarantino, but that doesn't mean it's not original at times, with very funny dialogue and situations and a keen sense of style. The soundtrack is also used very effectivly, especially in one scene where the saints break into a hitman's card game and turn the place into a bloodbath which ends up with a man being murdered with a cue ball. The music was perfect for this scene, blasting rythmic rock and then turning orchestral as they begin a shootout on a suburban street. Along with the fantastic Willem Dafoe's play by play explanation of what occurred AS the shootout is happening, this had to be one of the best shootout scenes i've seen since The Matrix. This is an extremely impressive debut from writer/director Troy Duffy, and saying it's the same as the direct-to-video trash with Mark Dacoscos and Eric Roberts doesn't do it justice.

What was anticipated to be an ordinary mafia, 'good guys conquer' film unravelled as a fast paced, witty, funny, realistically violent, clever & an intense film that needed to be watched at least several times to be fully appreciated.  As a past film student, I also found the camera techniques, cinematography & montages utilised as groundbreaking - everything was thrown in to create an interesting yet artistic piece of film.  Not a second of the movie could be missed - there was an overwhelming amount of action continuing in the backgrounds.  The soundtrack was as euphonic as the actors awesome. Definately one of the best action/drama films seen in a long time.",The Boondock Saints
565,shaden,A movie everyone should watch - twice,10,27 September 2000,"Despite the bad reviews I have read I would recommend watching this movie at least twice.  Watch it once for whatever pre-conceptions you have about the film.  Then, put your sensitivities aside and watch it again.  There is so much hidden meaning it is difficult to understand the full scope of the movie in just one viewing.  Yes, there is a lot of profanity, but that's realism.  The violence is there as well, but it is presented as the alternative to indifference.I found the movie to be both entertaining and moving.  I love the acting and the overall cinema tics.  Perhaps it has been done before, but the energy and emotion of the film is so tangible.  Although the circumstances of the film are a little outlandish, it still demonstrates the depth of love a person can have for another and the moral dilemmas society faces when deciding how to react to deviant behavior.",The Boondock Saints

All of the people who I have shown it to have loved it, it's just one of those kind of movies.  A movie with a plot that is hilarious at moments, to a powerful ending with smart dialogue. It is telling the story of two brothers who are doing something that everyone know's is wrong, but we love it anyway.  We want to say what they are doing is wrong, but in the back of your mind you ask questions to yourself if it can really be classified as wrong.  After all, they are killing bad men, or maybe that's what they tell themselves so they can feel better?  People ask questions at the end of the movie if it is really up to them to decide, which is a good touch by the director to show controversy.The Boondock Saints is a great movie.  I loved it for it's story, and dialogue.  The way it was shot was great too.  And I really wish that the writer/director Troy Duffy would get more praise for it.  This has all the flash of a major production, even though it was independent.  That's how good a job Troy Duffy did, I guess he just knows how to make movies.",The Boondock Saints

568,jdcaust,Incredible film with a lot of depth.,9,2 December 2002,"Wow, the first time I saw this film, I spent the night thinking about its implications.  To the casual viewer this seems like just another action flick with decent actors.  To someone who looks a little deeper, its a great movie with a unique, entertaining way of telling its story.  At its deepest, and at the level that struck me, it's a movie with religious overtones that raises questions about morality and corruption in society .  Most of the critics here seem to miss this point.  Contrary to some people's belief, this movie in no way condones the type of violence perpetuated by the protagonists.  Their vigilantism starts off fairly harmless - completely in self-defense of themselves and their friends.  However, once they realize the possible good they feel they can do by killing evil men, they start seeking the wrong-doers out and executing them.  With each killing, they take things a little farther and with a little less stealth and subtlety. Without giving too much away (possible SPOILER at this point), the end leaves the Saints having just committed their most violent, public execution while intimidating (but not hurting) many people.  On one hand, you are disgusted with how far they've come, but on the other, you can see the effectiveness by which they purify the evil that society cannot shrug off on its own.  The credits are perfect - running with a television reporter in the background interviewing the ""average"" New Yorker about how they feel about the Saints.  Some are supporters, some are critics, others want to join in.  All in all, it makes you wonder if it is moral for people to take matters into their own hands when the laws of government fail the people.",The Boondock Saints

It was a great idea to show the crime after, then before, to watch how two brothers, with so much love for each other overcome their circumstances, to do some ""good"". Although the ethics of their actions should be judged in a real life situation, in a film setting, it was a fun and wonderful look at the seedy underworld.

The acting is tremendous if you consider that Troy Duffy used relatively new actors, except for Willem Dafoe.  The dialogue in the movie just appears to be so natural, which is why it is awesome.  When the characters appear to be comfortable saying their lines then you know the dialogue works well.  The action sequences in the film are by far the best I have seen in a movie in the past decade.  The action works on all levels, even though at some times in the movie it is a bit unrealistic.(The scene where Conner jumps from 5 stories up and the scene where they fight Il Duce for the first time)The music in the film fits perfectly with every scene. The directing is impressive for the fact that it is Duffy's debut.  I only had one problem with this movie and that was when Murphy would lose his accent from time to time.  Besides that minor detail the movie is awesome. I give it a 10/10.",The Boondock Saints

Granted, I can't write very well now as it's 2:00 in the morning, but I can't say enough good things about this movie. It is, without a doubt, my second favorite movie I have ever seen, second to Good Will Hunting.

The best movies are the ones that make you think about about their message afterward (debate over the premises and conclusion) or the movies that tell their story in a captivating way; Boondock Saints did none of that. It was built up to be just like a Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs but it doesn't come close to those two classics. This movie's underlying message, if universalized, is ""anyone who is perceived as bad should be killed in the name of God""; seems to be the same logic that any terrorist would use. It's sick to think that people condone the killing that occurs in this movie.

This movie gave the Irish another reason to feel cool. Bad thing or not? Because on every St. Patricks Day, everyone is Irish. I wonder what plot the directors have The Duke and the brothers have moving towards. It will be interesting to see if Agent Smecker (Dafoe) becomes an integral part of the Saints.

577,Methatron,This is a great movie,10,2 February 2001,"I really don´t know where I shall begin in my comment on this movie........ well except that it is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. The acting in this movie is spectacular. Willem Dafoe does a brilliant performance as FBI agent Smecker, and Sean Patrick Flaherty and Norman Reedus does a really good piece of work as the McManus-brothers.Other things I feel I should mention is the dialogues, especially between the McManus-brothers, they are really funny, and the way Agent Smecker talk to his co-workers.....it´s just hilarious.At first this movie seem like your typical hero-actionmovie, with the McManus-brothers sent on a God-given crusade, against evil men. They walk the streets of Boston, killing one gangster after the other. They do this without really having a plan, it all start as self defense against some russian blokes they beat the crap out of in a barfight the night before. The russians want revenge and surprises the brothers in their own apartment, but the brothers get away in a rather unusual way..... Later they´re joined by Rocco, who has a lot of information about Boston-gangsters, so they start to wipe them out. During the McManus-brothers´ crusade, agent Smecker is constantly following them one little step behind, and when he cathes up with them he realize that the brothers really ""helps"" the police by killing badguys, so he decide to help them out.But maybe the most brilliant thing about this movie is the way the story goes. When the McManus-brothers have killed someone, you don´t really get to see how they have done it. You have to wait until Smecker start to solve the crime and figures out what happened before you can see it. And that is really cool.So the conclusion must be that this is a brilliant movie with great acting performances.

578,Deadly_Astrodart,Overrated and derivative,2,23 January 2003,"Almost everyone I know has been raving about this movie for some time. After seeing it, I'm wondering what all the fuss is about. ""Boondock Saints"" borrows so liberally from the visual/narrative techniques of Tarantino, Fincher, Smith, Ritchie, etc. it's almost embarrassing. Fragmented narratives, ultra-hip protagonists, kinetic montages, the F-word every other sentence -- it just seems done to death by now, especially when executed by what seems like the ""How to be a Cool 90s Filmmaker"" handbook. The two leads double-fist handguns like a pair of Chow-Yun McFats and have enough time to get in some witty, at times pop-culture concerned, repartee. People get into tough guy shouting match confrontations because that's what all tough protagonists have done since the early-mid-90s. Dafoe's FBI agent character listens to opera when trying to figure a crime scene so it'll lend an air of pseudo-artsy-fartsiness that people will mistake for some form of profundity -- the religious aspect also seems added for a similar reason.Still, the movie does have it's brighter moments. When ""Boondock Saints"" stops aping other movies and comes into its own, the film actually starts to get good. The moral ambivalence of vigilante justice is an interesting notion, but it hardly gets developed in the film until the very end. This issue is passed over instead for shouting matches and flashback-driven fragmented narratives. If the movie just didn't try so hard to be edgy and just tried to be true to its material, a better movie more worthy of such praise would have been the end result.If only ""Boondock Saints"" had just been itself (a rather modest crime and vigilante movie) and not what it turned out to be (a flick too hip for its own good), maybe then I'd see what all the hype was about. It is an entertaining movie, but in my opinion is not on the same level as the movies and filmmakers it so blatantly takes from. 6/10",The Boondock Saints

It should have been more violent. The movie takes it's main ideas from movies like Taxi Driver,etc. It is filled with poor stereotypes. And the direction is the worst. Get Troy Duffy out of the the film business please! There are very few good parts in this movie. One is in the beginning when they are in the chapel, two when the cat is shot, and three when Willem Defoe's character is in the confession booth.

It grasps you from the moment the first scene rolls, and you will be left staring at the screen during the credits. Sean Patrick Flanery's and Norman Reedus's powerful acting, along with the other characters, literally sucks you into the TBS experience. Action and adventure awaits you as you press the play button on your DVD player for this movie, and you will not be disappointed.

Moral vs. immoral and legal vs. illegal. Yes, the first two ""killing"" scenes were very very unrealistic, yet, possible. Even so, the movie has the best plot I have ever seen and it had the best ending I have ever seen a movie have. No thoughts even came close to my mind about the movie ending the way it did. But what I truly love about Boondock Saints, is that in order for any of it to make sense, you have to see three key parts. The very opening scene in the church, as they leave the Sin Bin, and the ending. The movie is about killing, yes, but unlike other murder and action films, this one requires you to listen to the words spoken as well as those unspoken, which in my mind, are some of the most brilliant things I have heard.

Willem Defoe is an accomplished actor and his character's negative opinion of the Boston police is evident. It is nice to see that as the story unfolds he does seem to like them a lot better as they become more competent in the case. I liked that the brothers were educated and religious. I know that they are supposed to be fraternal twins but it seems more like big brother/little brother the way they act. Conner (Sean Patrick Flanery) acts more mature and level headed. He seems to always be trying to calm things down. Murphy (Norman Reedus) is more youthful and definitely less serious. He is very excitable and the way they play off each other is incredible. Some of the looks that pass between the two of them are intense; you can feel what they are saying. Both of those actors were very good and their Irish accent could melt ice it was so hot. The last main character, Rocco, played by David Della Rocco is the complete opposite of the McManus brothers. I liked his wit and the humor he added to some situations. ""Is it dead?"" after he had just shot a cat and splattered it on the wall. Funny. The religious aspect of the vigilantism puts some meaning other than just killing behind the violence. ""Evil man, dead man."" The prayer is exceptional and fits the movie perfectly. One of the biggest draws to the movie for me was the way Smecker (Willem Defoe) would say what he thinks happened then we get to see what really happened. As he gets closer to figuring them out the two aspects of this start combining. Very well played. All in all I would recommend seeing/purchasing this movie to anyone.

I'd had enough after an hour of the ridiculous premise, the poor acting, and the repeated claims of my friends accompanying me that this movie was ""great."" Ignore the ubiquitous use of the f-bomb and this is an instantly-forgettable superhero shoot-em-up movie for middle schoolers with an unsettling penchant black nail polish and playing Doom.The following is a brief list of the offenses committed by the director against film-goers with an IQ above 60:1. A man leaps from a the roof of a multi-story apartment building, only to land conveniently on top of a standing bad-guy and continues forth unharmed. 2. The two ""heros"" are inside an HVAC vent shaft in the ceiling, above a meeting attended by the ""bad guys."" Predictably, the vent breaks and instead of falling to the floor, our two ""heros"" are magically tied together by a rope and suspended from the shaft opening, where they emerge victorious in a fire-fight, despite being grossly out-numbered and more vulnerable than a piñata at a children's birthday party (which is indicative of the type of people who gave this movie favorable reviews, I suppose). 3. The ""heros"" are portrayed as champions of moral integrity, despite, you know, killing those that they perceive as depraved by shooting them in the back of the head as they kneel before them, a method of execution and terror that would even make an Iraqi dictator stand and applaud. The Bible verses are a nice touch here--clearly applicable during scenes of cold-blooded murder.This is a terrible, horrendous, ghastly, lewd, appalling film that I would not wish its viewing upon my own worst enemy. Avoid at all costs.",The Boondock Saints
599,DominionOfGrace,Being what every man wants to be.,10,1 September 2006,"A long time ago I thought I had seen a movie for every situation that mattered. Consuming as the many plots may have been, I watched them and enjoyed quite a few.The I was at my friends house. We had watched A Few Good Men, and Donnie Darko and other such movies that I had watched before but always were good for a few laughs or surprises. He put in Boondock Saints.Now keep in mind I have always been someone that will fight the system in any way I know how. I do not back down. The movie came on. I was mesmerized. I have never been as locked into the lives of characters outside of reading a great novel. If ever there was a movie that as a movie could be considered that well written this is it.The two brothers are your average Irish Catholic blue collar workers, just trying to make ends meet in the ghetto of Boston. They care deeply for family and friends, and end up protecting the bar to which they are regulars at. In that they angered off the Russians they had fought. Through out the movie they take on the responsibility the cops of South Boston are afraid to do. They try to take out every evil person they can find, or at least whatever they consider evil.If you have not watched this yet. Watch it. If your Catholic, Blue Collar, Intelligent, or just plain sick of people doing evil you will connect with them. You will feel just that much better about the world around you. You'll also probably be ranting about how you wish their were more people like them in this world.",The Boondock Saints

I have seen a lot of movies in my day,and i have a lot of favorites, but this is by far the best movie I have ever seen.So if you have not seen this movie yet. Well u probably wouldn't be here. ,But if you are here and you haven't saw it you should check it out. Trust me you won't be disappointed.It's worth the time to watch it once.

601,eringorman4,"Great piece of film, enjoyed every moment of it!",10,30 October 2002,"The Boondock Saints, is a film that I just recently had the pleasure of viewing. I had never heard of the movie until I saw it in the seven day rental section at the video store. I picked it up not expecting much, but to my delight and surprise it turned out to be an incredible film. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus did an amazing job of demonstrating brotherly love and even though they were killers, for some reason as a viewer I felt no sympathy for the victims, which probably was Troy Duffy's intention, and I simply enjoyed just hearing the MacManus brothers speak (I love the Irish accents). I have the DVD and even though there are no special features I thought it would make a great addition to my movie collection. I know that not everyone feels the same way as I do, but it all depends on taste. If you get a chance to see the film I strongly recommend it, and I hope no one is disappointed. I look forward to the Boondock II: The Second Coming. I'll Catch You On The Flip Side!",The Boondock Saints
602,wjbarricklow,are we missing something here?,8,30 September 2006,"I see why this movie got crappy reviews. It's obviously low budget. It's a b movie. Much of the acting is mediocre. A movie will usually use a certain amount of artistic license, but it at least has to be believable. The plot has some goofy stuff, like the cops going over crime scenes. How often do you cops assume a criminal is using two guns or using a 50 caliber pistol? Like there's crooks running around with desert eagles all over the place.That said, there are some redeeming qualities. The Boondock Saints does bring you to question our ideas about religion, morality and justice. The religious slant- some people seem to believe the words the preacher says in the beginning, ""we should all fear evil men."" Anyone familiar with Christianity would understand a Christian is not to fear men. The only thing to fear is God's judgement. And I'm not sure where I've seen it but the Bible says, ""Vengeance is mine saith the Lord."" So it's not for you or me or anyone to go out there and cast judgement, it's for God to do. Unless, of course, God wants you to do send the villain up there to face judgement. There's the moral dilemma.Anyone notice that the word ""veritas"" (truth) on the brother's hand is shown upside down when the Willem Defoe's characters crosses the line and starts working with them? Not sure if it was intentional, but if so it may be a comment on the what we view as truth, good guys vs. bad guys, being turned upside down.That may be reaching a little. But a majority of posters on this board seem to either love this for being a typical shoot-em-up movie or condemning it for the same reason. I think the script was written with some social commentary in mind, and I have to wonder if some are missing this when they watch the movie.",The Boondock Saints
603,r-alhadeff,This was awesome,10,1 November 2006,This was one of the best films I have ever seen. The theatrical talent displayed in this movie was astounding thinking back on that they couldn't get funding. The is truly an exciting film with a bit of controversy in taking law into your own hands. It shows a complete understanding of what the fans want and need to be entertained. The film will twist your mind at the end making you decide what you think of the issue brought up in the movie. It also has just the right mix of violence and drugs that it makes you think; did i just watch a political action movie. This movie is truly the most astonishing action I have ever seen and definitely one of the three best movies I have ever seen bested only by Crash and maybe Remember the Titans.,The Boondock Saints

Two years after its release, it has taken Halifax by storm. Quoted amongst friends and coveted by many. If you haven't seen it, do so. Watch it with friends and enjoy it for years.

607,pvieites-28101,Really good action movie with a lot od dark humour.,7,19 June 2021,"I would recommend this movie to anyone who want a fresh action movie they can have fun with and maybe open a debate with their friends after watching it.The story solid and they develop each character properly, and they narrate every situation in a way that's entertaining to see. The movie knows how to surprise as it goes. Something I like a lot is that they don't overexplain anything, but at the same time they don't hide the info as a puzzle so the viewer can feel intelligent and brag about it on the internet. They just give you info organically and that's really good IMO.Something I noticed, is that the movie doesn't take itself too serious. Yes, the movie wants to open a debate about the Vigilante figure. But more than that, is a movie full of dark humour and campyness done on purpose. I mean they use some homofobic and xenophobic jokes, and also they laugh about this kind of humor. This not only works to entertain the viewer, but also to reduce the story to a mundane level, and to avoid making this vigilantes a totally clean and heroic figure.The score is ok, it fits. There are lots of iconic scenes, the director really knows how to make that kind of scenes. Overal the tempo of the movie is really good. Not too fast, not too slow, it just makes you enjoy more the action scenes and the other scenes about the characters. Another good thing about the action scenes, is that every action scenes is used to develop more the characters and advance on the plot. Something that seems stupid to remark, but in this genre is pretty usual to make action scenes that don't do those things.In conclussion. Overall an enjoyable movie, fun fresh, with hilarious moments, and iconic scenes. Furthemore if you watch it with more people the movie will probably make you start a debate about vigilantes if you want to.",The Boondock Saints

609,Bapp325,Great Movie,9,9 January 2007,This is a movie that I have only recently seen and it is one that i have enjoyed so much. One of the great things that happen in this movie is that there is a variety of characters. It ranges from a gay detective to to a bartender with turrets. It blends very nicely a combination of seriousness with humor. Also there is a great showing in the movie of how family can stick up for each other and over come obstacles. A cool things that they do that confused me and i really think made it a better movie was they first went ahead in time and then show you what really happened. This leaves you to guess what really happened before you see for sure. I like how this movie ends and i am not happy that they never built off of the ending. But it is usually sequels that manage to ruin a good movie. I give it an easy 9 stars.,The Boondock Saints

611,pegasus_style,Pathetic commercialism thrown in,1,15 January 2007,"The laughingly bad scene of how the two brothers help each other escape the Russian mafia lair after they're held captive is like a case of a bad director without a budget or creativity, so it just cuts to flashbacks all the time as a failed means to plug in the huge holes. (Then again, there are so many bad scenes like this its like a cross between Death Wish and Plan Nine from Outer Space.) Although one area that Plan Nine didn't have was shameless product placement. Did you see so many Pepsi cans being drunk at the breakfast table by these two Boondock ""Sugar Saints?"" How apparent was it that the director Troy Duffy (who does a horrible cameo appearance of himself at the Irish bar in the beginning of the movie, acting like an ugly midget from a gay porno movie) blew the money for the film on partying and ended up with half the time of the film just of guys getting drunk on camera and shouting the f-word louder and louder (like ornery obnoxious drunks, which is what Troy must have been while making this abomination of a stinker). If you're searching for a good movie in this much, watch ""Overnight,"" the documentary on the making of the film which shows Troy Duffy's ego running havoc and he's reduced to yelling at himself while flat-down drunk on a street corner.Sure there's some of his paid people that come on here and now try to sell it as a cult film (more like Jonestown Cult). They've also been talking for years of a sequel, although the only appropriate actors for the directorial phlegm that Duffy dishes would be to have the ""Saints"" replayed by Tom Green in a ""Freedie got Fingered"" style role, whipping out his member and Troy trying to find some Gaelic-orchestral music with bad gun blanks to make it seem divine.",The Boondock Saints

I think that a majority of the people who rate the movie low don't understand the movie. One other person that commented said that they didn't understand why the ""unidentified old man"" decided to join the brothers because of the prayer. That guy is their father. Since he's been in jail for 25 years, when they see each other, they don't realize that they are family. But when they speak the prayer, and the older man joins in, they realize that that's their father. Also, I don't think that the mafia guys that they killed in the alley were their first kill. I believe that they have been doing this for awhile, hence, the prayer, etc.I'm really hoping to see a sequel to Boondock Saints, although I'm not sure that there will be.

I already know the plot somewhat and I'm pretty sure I know how the characters are going to be used. The odd thing about this movie is that I had no idea what it was going to be about. I had no idea who the actors were or what the genre was. I think that was a great idea because it really allowed me to approach it with a clear mind.The story bounces back and forth between the Saints, two brothers on a vigilante-killing spree, and the detectives investigating the murders. The way in which the plots weave in and out through scenes from the future, past, and current times really sets it apart. The story is told logically, but in a way that it is really only conveyed in bite sized bits.The acting was spot on from the opening credits to the closing ones and I must say a few parts caught me off guard due to the amazing presence that was displayed bey the relatively nameless actors. This is one of those movies that I went out and bought simply because I heard a friend talking about it. He said I had to see it. I had never heard of it before that, but it will now be going into my collection of movies to watch often right up there with Reservoir Dogs and V for Vendetta.

The fact that it has the classical, opera-type music behind action, that was ingenious. They say the Boondock Saints was the rise and fall of Troy Duffy, but my opinion is, he should write some more good stuff like this. Can't wait for Boondock Saints II and I hope you can get around all the bullshit holding you back from making and releasing it, Troy. I don't think this movie could've been any better.

It had humor, morality, and a sense of purpose. I am also not one to repeatedly watch the same movie. However, I must confess that I have watched this one five times so far. I did not find out about it until St. Patty's day of this year. I was shocked that I had never heard of it before. Considering that the horrible Colombine issue is long past, I believe this movie should have a new debut and nominations for Oscars. William Dafoe was creative, entertaining, and ended up be coming an inspiration to the detectives that worked under him. It was brilliantly done and kudos to Troy Duffy and all those that made the film possible. Just when you think you can figure out what is going to happen next, you discover you are clueless. Being Scotch-Irish, I understood the moral mentality behind the movie in spite of its vigilante message. It corresponds to how we have had to fight our way to freedom and continue to do so to this day! Great film and deserves a second shot at becoming an Oscar nominee in several categories.

A better moral plot has yet to be developed in any movie.I believe the end of the movie summed up exactly why this movie is either hated or loved. When interviewing people on the street half of the people supported the ""Saints"" and what they were doing while the other half felt they were nothing more than criminals themselves.

Duffy's use of time is almost like those of Chris Nolan's in Memento and Following but in a different style. Every part is picked perfectly and played to perfection itself. Willem Dafoe, an unbelievable actor regardless of this movie, plays the perfect role as the homosexual FBI agent; Flannery and Reedus work perfectly together as the McMannus brothers, as well as whoever plays the bad Boston detective, whose bit part is perfect for the Boston set film.

I also don't understand the comparison with pulp fiction, in my opinion, it just does not work.This is the story of two Irish brothers and their mission: kill all of the evil men in the world.  The depth of this story is incredible, and it can be taken so many ways.  They can be looked at as hypocrites; because the Italian man they befriend is low on the chain of mafia men.  They can be seen as heroes, cleaning up the streets, making the world a safer place. Or they can be seen as devils, who are they to decide who is evil and thereby who gets to live and die?  Who made them judge, jury, and executioner?The greatest element of this movie is, as in all his other performances, Willem Dafoe.  When asked who the best character of all time is, I always say Agent Paul Smecker of the boondock saints (yes, even after the emergence of Captain Jack Sparrow).  Dafoe, as usual, plays his part the best, his character is great and he just nailed it.The witty comedy in this film also makes it worth seeing.  Try to catch the jokes that every character makes, the Irish brothers especially are incredibly witty.The movie never stops moving, great action, with a good part told in flashback by Dafoe's investigation.  Dafoe even reenacts many of the scenes himself; incredibly funny moments.Whoever said this movie is bad, I would assume that person is not too smart. In order to really appreciate this movie, one needs to come into it with a certain level of intelligence; the plot does in fact get very complex. Perhaps a second watch would allow some to appreciate this film more.  I give it a high rating, a 9/10.  Great job all around, can't wait for the sequel!",The Boondock Saints

I have been patiently waiting for 9 years for another great Boondock Saints film. This movie should be seen by every human being.

It is simply a good movie about guys who get fed up with those who are corrupt. it is not a shoot-em up movie, it is not a well known movie because it was supposed to be released during the Columbine incident but for obvious reasons it was not. but believe me it is worth it.",The Boondock Saints

The plot is ridiculously improbable as are most of the characters. I kept hoping it would get better, then it mercifully ended. There are so many errors in the film it becomes more comical than the comedy that's supposed to be there. Some people are comparing this to works from Ritchie or Tarantino. Sorry, I can't see it. Both those directors have a style that's entertaining and grabs your attention. This film misses by a wide margin. There's no style, no originality and the violence becomes boring.

This movie is outstanding. Unlike a lot of crime movies, this one tells its tale in a novel, well thought out... and sometimes bizarre way. There is gratuitous violence and profanity which makes it unsuitable for children but it is great Friday night film for adults. Troy Duffy did a great job writing and directing this picture and the acting in it is outstanding. I did feel however, that some of the errors hindered the film from perfection. It is sad that this movie didn't garner more attention than it did, but it nonetheless is a genuine piece of cinematic treasure worthy of any film collection. It is not a new flick, but anyone interested in crime movies (it even has humor in it too) who has not seen it should not wait any longer, go rent or buy it, (certainly worth the money) you will not be disappointed.",The Boondock Saints

It mixes a terrific story, well developed characters, and comedy to entertain the viewer and keep them on the edge of their seats.Willem Dafoe gives the performance of a lifetime, playing the homosexual FBI detective, who seems to have a sixth sense when it comes to investigation. If it hadn't been for Columbine, and the limited release of this film, he would have received a lot of praise for his role.Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus give great performances as well.

I found it slightly odd that the rave reviews were, by-and-large, given to me by a certain group of people, namely, sheep-witted white suburbanite video game addicts.""This,"" I thought to myself, ""could just be a fluke. Maybe they're just the first to spot this rarely watched movie.""I can see why the aforementioned audience liked it. There are a lot of fire-fights.There are a lot of highly, highly unrealistic, disgustingly one-sided fire-fights.The plot is hackneyed and underdeveloped. Had the writer gone through one or two more drafts, maybe it would have been entertaining. The characters were very flat. There really was no development of the characters, with the exception of Paul Smecker (Willem Dafoe).There are also gaping plot holes (or things that are entirely left out).As I said, there is an audience for this, and once members of that audience watch the movie, they take it, well, religiously. This movie is compared to Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. There are vaguely similar themes, but The Boondock Saints lacks all of the style, wit, intelligence, and originality that the other two films have.But if you don't mind seeing a film about vigilante justice (I am still not convinced that that is the motivation behind the whole thing; it seems to me that the characters' sole purpose is fairly motiveless violence with socially acceptable targets [read: 'evil people']) with lots and lots of shooting, go ahead and check it out.Just my $0.02..",The Boondock Saints

Second, how does this movie not show motive? The brothers believe they had a message from god ""destroy all which is evil "" ""so that which is good may flourish"". This movie has a heavy religious overtone, which makes sense because the brothers are Irish Catholics. What else? Oh, yeah, Smecker's reason for joining the brothers is because, LIKE HE SAID, he believes what these guys are doing is necessary and correct because he ""...puts evil men behind bars...but there are miles of red tape and loopholes"". So, there are some examples that puts holes in some of your arguments to why this movie sucks.

648,emchron1,Amazing Movie!!,9,29 September 2008,"Could killing people and getting away with it really be possible in today's world? What if someone could actually pull this off? Would the world really be that much better off than what it was previously? These were some of the question I was asking myself after I saw this movie for the first time. It was a captivating movie that made me really wonder if what I saw was possible. The movie is Boondock Saints (1999), one of the greatest action thrillers I have every seen. Troy Duffy, the movies producer and writer, combined a cast and crew that formulated a perfect story of two Irish Boston brothers who find themselves at the center of Boston's crime scene. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus play Irish brothers, Connor and Murphy MacManus and David Della Rocco plays the brother's best friend, ""the funny man."" The movie is rated ""R"" for strong violence, language and sexual content. This movie was even banned from some theaters due to the graphic nature of the film. The movie begins in Boston on Saint Patrick's Day and for most Irish men, St. Patty's Day is a big event. However, for these two Irish brothers, this holiday will be one they will never forget. It starts when they get in a bar fight with two members of the Russian Mob. The MacManus brothers make it back to their apartment safely that night, but in the morning the Russian Mobsters track the brothers down and break into their apartment. They're looking to kill. The brothers however, turn the tables on the mobsters and violently slay them with what seems to be a little help from a higher being. They turn themselves into the police but are let go, since, in most people's eyes, what they have done has been a good thing for the society. The brothers see this as a sign from God and begin roaming the city and killing all criminals that are causing harm to the citizens of Boston. They massacre several groups of criminals in a violent and bloody fashion that captivates the audience. With a twist at the end that no one sees coming, this movie gets a rating of four stars out of five. The only thing I would have liked to see was more plot detail and better Irish ascents. However, the good outweighs the bad just like the bullets fly just as easy as people breathe.The main characters are identified early, being the MacManus brothers, ""The Funny Man"", the FBI agent, and all the criminals the brothers intend to slaughter. The plot is simple and straightforward. It has one twist but not until the end, however, it is a twist that leaves the viewer a little stunned. The setting, Boston, Massachusetts, is an appropriate city for the shooting of this movie. With ties to the Russian Mob, Boston was the right pick. This gives the movie a little more authenticity and realism. Authenticity also comes through in the form of symbols, including the pennies, which are symbols of currency so the dead have something to offer to get into the afterlife and the rope, which symbolizes irony and struggle between the brothers. The costumes of the mob members are perfect to what the common person thinks a Russian Mobster should wear, including flashy white suits with gold chains and chest hair sticking out the top of the collar. And the color black, which the brother's wear, is perfect for the dark and suspicious roles that they play. Makeup also plays a major role in this movie. With all the blood shed, someone has to make it look real. Mario G. Cacioppo did just that as the films makeup artist. Especially, when the brothers and ""The Funny Man"" had to iron their wounds shut since they could not go to the hospital due to the fear of getting caught. The music used gives the viewer a sense that they are watching something so dramatic that anything could happen at anytime and gives it a true dramatic movie feel. The music has almost a religious tone to it that make it seem like they are performing Gods work. Along with the music, the camera angles also show that the brothers are empowered. They are often shown with close up shots and shots with the camera down below as if they have a lot of power. They also use aspects like slow motion to make the scenes more dramatic and commanding. Boondock Saints obviously displays many literary, theatric, and cinematic elements within the movie that make it a stellar film. However, one of the most powerful parts of the movie is a simple prayer the brother's say every time they execute one of their victims. ""Sheppard's we shall be, For thee, my Lord, for thee. Power hath descended forth from Thy hand, Our feet may swiftly carry out Thy commands. So we shall flow a river forth to Thee, And teeming with souls shall it ever be. In Nomeni Patri Et Fili Spiritus Sancti."" I found this prayer very powerful and, oddly, I got goose bumps every time I heard it. Overall, this movie is a ""must see"" and a great fictional film that leaves us with one question, ""Would this really be possible?""",The Boondock Saints

Don't get me wrong, I knew it was a crime/action movie. Does this mean, no criticism needed? It claims to be neutral in the end, but through the hole story it sympathizes with the poor handsome men who kill for a better world. My first opinion was, it is intended to see the main actors with sympathy, I waited for these guys to turn bad. Instead you watch them enjoy it to kill, still they are cool, funny, loving brothers and we should be entertained. I liked the nonlinear storytelling, but what does it help with this stupid story? Even Defoe looks awful in such a dumb role with this senseless habits and disgusting opinion. Create a REALLY bad character, let him be executed and let people watch it: in fact, many of us are enjoying this, there is no other reason for black and white hollywood.

To my surprise, this was not only one of the best indie films I have seen, it was one of the best movies I have seen. I have talked to many people about this movie, and most people say they loved it too. However, there are the few who did not like it. These people claim that it is a rip off of Tarantino's style. I strongly disagree for two important reasons. First of all, Tarantino movies tend to have a lot of pointless babbling in them. Some of it is funny, but most of it is annoying. Boondock Saints gets to the point and keeps the viewer on the edge of their seats; the viewer has no idea where the movie is going to go next. Because this movie has guns, is independent, has action, and has some comedy in it critics call it a Tarantino movie. This makes absolutely no sense to me; it is like no one can make a movie with these ingredients without it be called a Tarantino rip off. This movie is a true indie movie which is much more fun then any movie Tarantino has made.",The Boondock Saints

655,bighanzjohnson86,The Boondock Saints,8,13 July 2009,"""The Boondock Saints"" is a cult classic that went straight to DVD. The movie takes place in Boston and follows twin Irish boys Connor (Sean Patrick Flanery) and Murphy McManus (Norman Reedus). After a conflict with a Russian gang that ends with three of the members dead, the brothers decide to turn themselves in to the cops. Rather than being treated as criminals they were proclaimed heroes for cleaning up the streets of its garbage. The brothers decide to continue to kill off other criminals with the help of their buddy Rocco (David Della Rocco), but in the process grabbing the attention of detective Paul Smecker (William Dafoe). The main theme director (Troy Duffy) is using throughout the movie is the indifference in good men; it is even mentioned in the beginning of the movie in a sermon. I believe that Duffy is trying to let this thought linger in the minds of his audience. What if all of society was to just go and kill people that they believe are evil? Who can really decide who is good and evil, or if their actions are justified? This is a very controversial topic that has people choosing sides, but there is no real answer, so this argument will never end. At the end of the movie, they interview people and ask them how they feel about the Saints. This is a good example of how people have different opinions on the subject. The way they show the gun fight scenes is different than most movies. They don't just show them shooting people; rather they show it from the detective's point as he is putting the scene together in his head hours later. This brilliant movie wasn't shown in theaters because the tragic event of Columbine that took place in 1999. Just because this movie didn't make it to the big screen doesn't mean you should miss out on one of the best movies of all times.",The Boondock Saints

661,Kyle_Toth,A trip down Memory Lane - Boondock Saints,9,14 January 2010,"I believe that Boondock Saints (1999) is one of the best movies ever. I give it a 9.9 out of 10 stars (no one is perfect). The movie begins in a church, during Christian mass, where a priest is telling a true story about a young girl who was killed in front of 16 people who did nothing to help her. During the priest's story you see two men, who you later learn are Irish fraternal twins Connor & Murphy McManus, get up from their seats during the priest's speech, kneel, and pray in front of a wooden statue of Jesus and leave. This scene sets the tone of the movie much like a great speaker opens with impact that captivates the attention of the audience. The movie centers around these two ""Saints"" who kill evil men, the wrong doers in their city. They begin by eliminating two ""soldiers"" of the Russian mob who want McGinty's bar to close down where the Saints enjoy spending their free time drinking and socializing with friends. The Saints wouldn't have these men from the mob close down the bar so a fight ensued with the Saints coming out victorious. The Russian mob soldiers followed the Saints home and attempted to kill both of them but once again were beaten by the Saints but this time ending in their deaths. The plot continues when Rocky (David Rocco), an errand boy for the Italian mob, aids the Saints by using his knowledge of the mob to find and eliminate the rapists, murders, and other forms of scum that he previously worked for. After realizing that the Saints and Rocky are exterminating his people, Papa Joe the leader of the Italian mob brings in ""The Duke"" to take care of his ""problem"". After many more deaths and a heck of a lot of action, the Saints and Rocky get captured by the very man they are trying to kill, Papa Joe, who ends up killing one of them. After the murder, no one was expecting what happens next... Overall, the movie was extremely good with its plot, acting, special effects and various ways to use the F-word. The movie is set in an urban environment in modern times in the city of Boston. The costumes were very realistic and believable for the time of shooting and set the heroes of this movie (The Saints) to be average everyday people, with amazing killing skills set aside. There was little to no lighting needed because most of the time the scenes were shot in rooms that were well illuminated or outside in the daytime. The sound effects of this movie were very good and believable, such as gun shots sounded realistic and breaking glass sounded like glass shattering. The quality of the sound was also excellent meaning you can hear their footsteps, voices, etc. very clearly. This movie is so good you can watch it over and over again and learn something new each time. I believe the actors chosen to play Connor & Murphy McManus (Sean Patrick Flanery & Norman Reedus) could not have possibly been any better. Even Rocky (David Rocco) was a great choice. David Rocco (Rocky) lived up to the ""Funny man"" with his enthusiasm and believability. This movie is full of action, great acting, a extremely well written plot, and jam packed full of good actors to enhance your viewing pleasure. If you have never seen this movie before I suggest you go out now and watch it, and even if you have to go out and see it a second time you will agree with me, it is just THAT good.",The Boondock Saints
662,dmjohnso-635-104726,Great Movie - Possible Spoilers,9,15 January 2010,"The Boondock Saints (1999) opens up with Irish twin brothers Connor and Murphy praying in a church during a service on Saint Patrick's Day. The priest is talking about Kitty Genovese, who was stabbed to death in broad daylight, with plenty of witnesses, but no one did anything, not even call the cops. The priest's message is almost the same as the message throughout the entire movie. This is the idea that the indifference of good people is just as bad what the criminals are doing. The brothers take this to the extreme after they receive a message from God. This message tells them that they should kill the bad people in their city of Boston. By bad they mean the murderers, rapists, drug dealers, etc. that get out of jail on bail and continue back to their old ways. They start out with members of the Russian mob, and take out nine higher members of the mob. Their friend David Del Rocco, a.k.a. Rocco, a member of the Italian Mafia who has been ignored for years, decides that he wants to help them take out the mafia after he was set up and supposed to die. He is their informant of who people are, where they go, their habits, and any other information that may be useful. The brothers and Rocco, dubbed ""The Saints"" by the media, continue to kill all of the evil in the mafia. Meanwhile, FBI agent Paul Smecker, and three detectives from the Boston Police department are at the scenes of all of these murders. They are trying to figure out how they are all connected to one another since they are all mafia members that were murdered. When Smecker finally figures out who is killing these mafia members and their reasons for doing so, he believes in their cause, and even helps them find the safe house of the top leaders of the mafia. However when they get to the safe house to kill the mafia leaders, things go horribly wrong. There are different aspects of film in The Boondock Saints. First, are the literary aspects of the movie. In the beginning of the movie there is a narrator talking while the brothers pray. Also, throughout the movie, there are scenes in which Smecker narrates what happened earlier at the crime scene. Second, there are dramatic aspects when Connor is first taken by the Russian mob, when Rocco gets shot, and when Rocco goes crazy at his girlfriend over her cat. There are also aspects of the movie that are unique to a movie. These are cinematic aspects of a film. An example of cinematic aspects are the gunshot wounds that the Saints get when they are performing their deeds, as well as the few special effects that occur during the movie. Some of the special effects are when a character is shot, the blood splatter. Such as when Rocco shoots his girlfriend's cat, the blood is splattered all over the wall. The music picked for The Boondock Saints gives it an Irish feel. The opening scene is led with an Irish instrumental song as the main characters credits are on screen. The other music picked for during the fight scenes blends well with the battles. There is also a lot of music that sounds like it may come from church, since the brothers are supposed to be working from a message from God. There are a lot of Gothic style hymns and songs of lament after they just killed people. Since The Boondock Saints is a low budget film, there are not many special effects, but director Troy Duffy displays the gunfights well, as well as the many injuries that the characters gain throughout the movie. Duffy depicts how a few people do as much as they can for something that they believe in. The acting is also pretty good, as the character show many emotions throughout the movie. I would rate this movie an 8.5 out of 10 and would recommend this movie to anyone because of the great plot and action in The Boondock Saints.",The Boondock Saints
663,RussRuss467913,A dumb movie with dumb ideas.,1,23 May 2007,This movie is garbage. Yeah it has blood and swearing but so do a lot of other films. It does feature a giant helping of a moronic moralizing. All and all its basically a d grade pulp fiction knock off with a bunch of crappy stars that are graced by the presence of Willem Dafoe who turns in a crappy performance. Also the film features one of the worst 3rd act twists in recent film history. i would have given this movie maybe a 4 but the twist is so stupid that it basically pee's on the entire film. This is a film that is much adored by a certain type of unknowing film goer who expects little and gets little from a movie going experience. if you are a serious film goer skip this movie.,The Boondock Saints

Just Stupid, he looks like Joe Dirt.The message of the first film is lost. The mob guys are just ridiculous and not threatening or convincing.The back story of Il Duce is not that convincing ether.Even just the stupidity of the mob guy wearing his orthodontic brace while people are at his house, when they are only ever worn to bed??

I had never heard of it, and had no idea about the plot or reviews of the movie.  I can say that it just caught me off guard and drew me into the energy of the movie.  I agree that it has become an off beat cult film and was never a box office success. As stated previously the reasons being the unfortunate timing of its release.  I loved the acting and editing.  The flow of the movie was intense.  I know others have complained about the flashback narration but I thought that it was brilliant ! It provokes a reaction from its viewer.  The story is entertaining and will make you laugh and feel at the same time. It keeps you riveted to your seat. The action and dialogue are not to be missed !! After viewing it , I found myself telling others.  I kept thinking about the questions it raised which I think is evidence of a movie that needs to be seen by others.  I chose to add it to my favorite movie collection. It is a movie that can be viewed many times and enjoyed. I especially love the DVD out takes and deleted scenes.",The Boondock Saints
668,jeffchristenson,"this movie ripped off every other film ever made, including ""The Care Bears Christmas""",3,24 October 2005,"I won't attempt to argue the ethics of vigilantism. I would like to point out that this movie did not pioneer the concept. Here is a short list of films which have also touched on the idea. This is not nearly all of them, but it's a highlight of the ones produced in English, mostly in the USA, in the last 40 years.The Punisher, Batman, Spiderman, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, every other comic book hero (give or take)[******The Dynamite Brothers (1974)*******""Two brothers accomplished in the martial arts take on a vicious drug lord."" <--- sound familiar?]Every movie ever made starring Steven Seagal, Charles Bronsen, or Clint Eastwood. Taxi Driver, The Untouchables, The Annihilators, The Limey, The Brotherhood of Justice, Falling Down, Road House, Home Alone, Home Alone 2, Out for Blood, Outside the law, Above the Law, Extreme Justice, Instant Justice, Street Justice, Streets of fire, Fighting Back, Walking Tall, Body Count, Death Wish, Raw Deal, Next of Kin, Thou Shalt Not Kill...Except, Vigilante, Urban Menace, DaVinci's War, El Mariachi, Desperado, Once Upon a Time in Mexico, Lethal Weapon, Only the Strong, When the Bullet Hits the Bone, Ms 45, Angel Town, Sin City, Rush HourI found almost nothing in this movie to be original. What was up with ""Captain Highliner"" the F***ING fish stick killer? AKA ""The Ghost"". Not only does he reek of Sean Connery in ""The Rock"" (another movie you could add to the list) but his tactics were Neanderthal, some expert killer! He can't even ambush with a sniper rifle or ask the mafia for a bomb. And what's up with that anyway, working for the mafia? Isn't he one of the morally ""shit don't stink"", ""chosen ones""? He obviously doesn't need much evidence to justify the killing of a ""bad person"" because if he were a little more skilled then he'd have killed those three idiots before having a chance to find out who they are or what they've done.At least in ""The Rock"" Sean Connery was released from prison under the authority of high ranking government officials. How does this movie explain the release of said ""Ghost""? That the mafia can have anyone they want released from maximum security prison on a moments notice? Well thought out, in fact bravo on no plot holes throughout the movie.The brother's little Latin Bible quote before shooting (only the main target, who they were lucky wasn't taking careful aim on them as they had to leave him to last) strikes me as a rip off of Samuel L Jackson in Pulp Fiction. There are so many more direct and indirect rip offs I won't bother mentioning them.OK so I'm gonna tackle vigilantism a little. If anyone is allowed to be a vigilante, then each individual is left to decide if they are intelligent, informed, and perceptive enough to judge who deserves to die. Assuming we can agree that some people deserve to die for their crimes there is still the issue that... STUPID PEOPLE MAKE BAD DECISIONS AND WILL KILL THE WRONG PEOPLE!During a wave of publicity in Britain around year 2000 about paedophiles, the public media reported these cases where vigilantes took action against the wrong people. Likely there were other cases which went unpublicized:-* A man with the same surname as a known paedophile in the same area. (2 cases)* A man who lived in a house where a known paedophile lived before.* A paediatrician, because his job title starts with the same 4 letters (3 letters in USA spelling), and uneducated confusion due to use of a slang word ""paedo"" for ""paedophile"".Then there is the issue of killing for God in a society that has many different religions. Even if you adhere strictly to the ethics provided by the Christian Bible, you may be committing crimes in the opinions of the members of other religions. If one doesn't think that this is important then they are inviting RELIGIOUS WAR! And it is the attitude of vigilantism that propagates war around the world because any party that has a crime committed against them feels justified in committing crimes in retribution (Bush). The retribution is considered a crime by the party it is committed upon, worthy of retribution. I think it's easy to see that there can be only one end to such a cycle, do as Jesus suggested and ""Turn the other cheek"". It's an ancient concept that if one lowers themselves to the level of what they consider wrong in order to defeat that wrong, they will simply become part of that wrong.Then there is the small matter of a grey area. What about people that have only committed 51% of the crimes needed to fully deserve death?",The Boondock Saints
669,signup1919,Scattered Mess of A Film,4,1 April 2003,"Reading the comments made by others, I wonder if we saw the same film. This movie is terrible. The acting is poor. Several of the characters have accents that are all over the place. The characters in general are shallow sketches. Willem Dafoe goes way over the top. The il Duce character is a strange cross between Hannibal Lecter and Leon (The Professional) that just doesn't work.Many of the characters' actions seem unmotivated and there is quite a lot that is never really explained. Early on we discover that the MacManus boys are fluent in many languages and the FBI agent asks why educated guys like that are working in a meat packing plant. We never get an answer. And why have these characters be multilingual? It serves no purpose.Even their motivation for wanting to clean up the streets is not made believable.See La Femme Nikita. See The Professional. See State of Grace. Don't see this film unless you want to see a hapless cat get splattered and watch Ron Jeremy with his clothes on.",The Boondock Saints
670,pmroberson,Cinematic vomitus,1,12 July 2010,"OK, let's start with the obvious. As another reviewer aptly pointed out, this is NOT _Pulp Fiction_, although it desperately wants to be. With that out of the way, let's hack this piece of crap apart bit by bit:1. Willem Dafoe, who normally has my attention from Scene 1, overacts enough to embarrass Jim Carrey in his Ace Ventura days. I think it was direction rather than some weird intention of Dafoe to create a singularly uninteresting and unbelievable gay FBI agent, but be that as it may, it was awful.2. The plot. Booooooriing. Vigilantes killing bad people in interesting ways? Wow, that wasn't done in the 80s but every other movie.3. The self-aware cool factor. The brothers striding past the priest in Mass (oh, in slow motion, it's THAT cool), the inability of the screenwriter to avoid F-bombs in every scene, including the ridiculous self-control-losing ""soliloquy"" by Rocco, which contained nothing except the F-word, the ""Funny Man"" racist joke (helllooo, _True Romance_), the inane conversations about little things as Something Big Was About To Go Down.4. The Russians. I'm pretty sure the director called up the folks who did the voices of Boris and Natasha on _Bullwinkle_ and asked them how to do a realistic portrayal of some Reds, and then ignored their advice because it wasn't stereotypical enough.5. The ""real feel"" achieved by interviewing ""real"" folks through the closing credits. Well, that makes this piece of crap a relevant piece of crap, doesn't it? And now you know that it has REAL-WORLD IMPLICATIONS. Because real people are really talking on real TV (not really) about a real event that could, if it actually happened, be real.In closing, may I recommend you skip this _Pulp Fiction_ wannabe and go outside. Even if there's a tornado, you'll have a better time.",The Boondock Saints
671,Chiefdn,"A promising start with good story potential, then it got lost...",2,30 June 2017,"NOTHING NOT ALREADY IN THE DESCRIPTION.This movie had the opportunity to really be good. But then the initial premise was over in the first 30 minutes of the film, and it tried to become something else. And the further along it went, the further away from a good film it got. The opening sequences start with all the potential for a story line that could draw in the viewers, provide connectable characters, and entice with suspenseful action. All that ends when the brothers turn themselves in. After that, it takes a turn and tries to become something else, and moves from plausible possible to ridiculously impossible. And, after that; just crazy unbelievable. The further along I watched, the more I caught myself saying ""What?"". Even Dafoe's character moves from a serious undertaking to becoming a cliché. And then ending... once again, it tries to become something it's not; a commentary on society. If not for the ending, I likely would not be writing this. It took this film from unbelievable present day fantasy to just irritating; don't provide your audience with a movie that steps away from reality for the sake of entertainment, and then try to make them contemplate the ills of mankind... Revolver is a better film in its efforts to twist the viewer into thinking.Someone could take the first 30 minutes of this film and make it a basis for a good action story.

Mungo Jerry and Rumpleteazer are still at large.",7,23 August 2010,"If this movie was called 'Andrew Lloyd Webber's Roman Catholic Power Rangers', you might have a better idea of what you're in store for with Boondock Saints. But stay with me, O gentle reader, it shouldn't work but it does. The action scenes are bloody, slick and well choreographed - the kind you might embarrassingly catch a grown man acting out in front of a mirror in their shorts (shut up, we all do it)- yet the dialogue bizarrely has the real feel of heavy stage direction in it. Sometimes one character will shout something, then strike a pose or put his head in his hands while the other character gets to do his line, then become reanimated when its his turn again, like an amateur theatre production. I kept waiting for them to shout to The Virgin Mary ""We Need Dinozord Power Now!"" as a form of the ""Ezekiel 25:17"" speech in Tarantino's Pulp Fiction is played out all through this movie. The strange (perhaps unintentional) disconnect the not-quite-for-screen-acting creates removed it enough from reality to allow me to smile and cheer when someone gets shot and feel good about it, but there was always the slight fear they'd finally break into a musical number, which is something truly too disturbing for the big screen. Thankfully - and I hope this isn't too much of a spoiler - they never actually start prancing around singing show tunes! All in all, it sounds terrible - and could well be to many other people - but I'm giving it a seven out of ten for being an entertaining one of a kind, although I suspect it to be a fluke. If it was any camper or any grittier it would have been unbearable.",The Boondock Saints

681,poetofsilence,Another Bad Cliche (Spoiler A Little Bit),3,5 June 2003,"William Dafoe's performance was incredible... but the rest of the film left me to wonder why he would get involved in such a cliched ridden lemon.  I am thinking that Dafoe may have been intrigued by the director's use of quick cutting and editing of the film.  LeCompte, the director of Dafoe's theater company The Wooster Group, says that she is very interested with MTV and the quick cutting that comes out of it... and how it gives all of today's generation a mild form of ADD.  Maybe that is why people like the film. ""It is fast.""  I guess it is so fast that some people can't realize that the film is full of cliches.  A lot of people have referenced the Quentin rip-offs... so I won't elaborate.  But remember the scene where Dafoe puts the headphones on and listens to classical music?  He is a crazed guy who loves classical music!  Great!  What a paradox.  It was cut together so quickly. quickly. quickly.  Quick to his face.  Quick to his movements. Quick to the place around him.  Quick.  Fragments.  But then what are you watching?  You are watching just fragments thrown at you.  Has anybody seen The Professional?  Leon?  A crazed guy who listens to classical music?  A direct rip-off!  But maybe our eyes were too glossed over at this point to remember.  Rent this one and kick back some brews and try to just let your eyes glaze over.  Dafoe is great, but make sure you don't watch the dramatic sequences too carefully (particularly when the two brothers lose their good friend) or you will realize that the acting, Dafoe excluded, Sucks.  Who are these people?  Why do they decide to start killing people over religion? Why don't they feel remorse when they kill them?  If they are supposed to be religious, they should feel remorse... if they are insane, then pulling a trigger would not have any psychological effect.  But then LET'S SEE THE INSANITY!

Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus worked together beautifully as brothers and show the importance of family to them. As for the rest of the cast, they all do a great job bringing the movie together and Rocco does a wonderful job as a crazy Italian guy.

How ever, some how the failure of the director is total in this movie...I got almost angry when I realized that what could have been a perfectly good movie, was wasted because of some directors total lack of feeling when making a movie.The timing was terrible, the way the film was cut and put together was nothing but sloppy. The camera work was somewhat ok, but the director really seemed to trying to get som sort of recognition from the industry or something in every single scene!! rather then trying to make a good movie.He simply tried WAY TOO HARD...The FBI-agent was way too psycho, the heroes was way too cool, their friend was also way too psycho, the mob guys was soo bad(as in evil and vicous)that they turned ridiculous. Did you see that russian gangster, in that sceene where the heroes fell down through the roof? Oh my god, such a terrible fake belly he had in that scene. It's one of those small things, the whole movie is filled with'em.There is no excitement in the movie what so ever. I could predict almost every scene in the movie and when you can predict a film, it tend to get quite boring.The dialogue was also over the top, unmotivated talk, yells, screams, and unmotivated usage of the f-word in some scenes just made me yawn...I entirely blame the director for this one, he really turned a potential ""A"" movie into a crappy, booring ""H"" movie at the best.

The tale of a three men (two brothers and their father) who set out to rid Boston of the mafiosos and other scum that thrive there at the ""will of God,"" Boondock is a film that brings religion into a light few people are willing to consider it in. Ignore the negative reviews here, and SEE the movie. It'll be well worth the time.Great dialogue, prime acting, and a storyline that'll capture and HOLD your attention!",The Boondock Saints

695,hanitka,...AWESOME,10,7 December 2003,"For those of you who dislike the movie, then you're absolutely insane. I watched the movie at my boyfriend's house for the first time last weekend, and I absolutely LOVED it.. the way it was filmed is excellent along wtih the shooting sequences, the soundtrack and the acting, my god,the acting was incredible. I think the NC-17 version is a lot better than the R version but both are equally commendable. I give this a 10 out of 10 for becoming my new favorite movie",The Boondock Saints

The many twists and turns the movie takes as well as the jumps back and forth in time without ruining the flow of the movie makes this an excellent action movie with humorous elements and might even give some people something to think about.The only negative thing I have to say about it, is that the quality of the picture in the Region 2 DVD release I got is really bad for a DVD release, so if there is a better release, go for that one instead if you can.",The Boondock Saints

698,Blaze200121,Awesome movie,10,7 January 2004,And Shepards we shall be for thee my lord for thee What an awesome pray. This movie I can not get enough of but maybe thats because I am irish and religious who knows. All I do know is that I can't wait for the sequel to this movie. the actors were great the set up was wonderful the lines were well put together. I really only watch movies done by Troy duffy and two Left feet productions. Another good one is May. But thats off the subject. Great work on the movie,The Boondock Saints
699,Krucius,Nothing special,5,24 January 2006,"My friend and I were talking on the phone one day and I remember most of the conversation was him telling me how great this Boondock Saints movie was, so I tell him to bring it over so I can watch it, and frankly, I wasn't impressed.The movie was basically another gun-ho action movie to me. I wasn't into the whole religion and cleansing the world of evil crap, or maybe there's more to it then that? I pretty much assume the plot is two brothers suddenly deciding to kill all evil, so they get a bunch of guns and some rope. Throughout the movie they go on a bunch of missions to kill drug dealers, gangsters, mob bosses, etc. Overall I didn't see anything in this movie that should give it a 7.7. Id just give it a 5.",The Boondock Saints
700,kiyara14,Wow,10,17 January 2004,"So my friend has had quotes from this movie in his profile for as long as I can remember, has always talked about it, and has told me to see it. I went to visit him recently and we sat down for a night of movies and mayhem. So of course we watched this movie. And all I can really say to summarize how I feel about this movie is 'wow'. And I've also noticed that you either love the movie with a passion or you despise it and (as we've seen on this board) feel it's not worth the budget that was given.  Such is the way with cult movies. The acting was wonderful, the script was stimulating and there are so many quote-able lines and paragraphs that I could fill up pages and pages with them.  And hey, the deleted scenes just make the movie SO much better. Are there copious amounts of violence? Yup. Do they drop the f-bomb more times in one scene than in any other action flick you've ever seen? Yeah. But that really only adds to the mood of the film. Is this movie a prepubescent/teenage boy's violent dream come true? Yeah, but I'm a girl and I loved it to and I swear I'm not insane, so there you go. The movie isn't about the violence, it's about the plot line; about pushing limits, about making people think; is what the MacManus brothers are doing the right thing? And the interviews with 'people' during the credits just drive the point home. The actors are great. The Irish accents are nearly spot on in most of the movie (and for those of you who say they aren't, I'd really like to know how many Irish people you know because the ones I know sound pretty similar to the accents displayed here!) I enjoyed Willem's character in this movie so much more than in Spiderman. His character had depth. His character, as well as most of the other situations in the movie, is ridden with cliches that were necessary to lighten up the 'shoot shoot shoot kill kill blood' theme that you really can't deny is there. I got a kick out of them anyway. To stop my babbling before it's too late, I will end by saying this much: Although a violent movie, the plot and scripting definitely carries this movie to the top of my cult films list, even to the top of my 'best movie ever' list. So it gets a 10/10 in every aspect. And I can't wait till All Saints Day comes out - I'll be the first to see it in this town.",The Boondock Saints
701,Ques_Nova,A must see!!!,10,26 January 2004,"This was an incredible movie. It had an in depth plot and was very original. Unlike, a lot of recent movies offering alot of violence and death for no apparent reason, this one made a challenge: end the indifference. Something else I really liked was after the movie there was a commentary by the extras, which I felt really represented how people saw the movie. While the idea behind it is illegal, alot of people would really be in favor of it just to wipe out the scum. Not only that but there were hot Irish guys.",The Boondock Saints
702,Rocco-,"Great film, divides people to fans and haters",10,11 April 2004,"The opening scene is just great, you can feel the holiness and purity flowing inside you. As the brothers step out of the church, the mood goes funny and humorous.All the actors did a great job, the looks on their faces, the emotion... aahh... it's just plain excellency. David Della Rocco and Willem Dafoe did particularly good jobs. By the way, as Rocco hasn't got much experience, you should be surprised how good job he did in this film.Off-topic: why do people write the movies LIKE THIS BIG?! it looks stupid when its like this: i liked THE BOONDOCK SAINTS but i love TERMINATOR 2.Anyway, i think tells us something. It tells us how can we be Good if we let evil things happen? There is no Good without Evil, but we must do everything we can to stop evil! Mark my words: If evil fights, fight back. If evil is spreading, stop it. If evil is killing all pure and holy, call me and ill finish it!",The Boondock Saints

Kudos to William Defoe for Riverdancing in the middle of a crime scene, and to everyone else for being... well... in it. The acting was superb, and the movie skillfully straddled the fine line between absurd comedy and Godfather-esque vengeance.The gratuitous violence (along with the heavy-handed religious references) may turn some people off. Basically, the movie isn't for everyone. But for anyone who enjoys the Godfather, Monty Python--or an odd combination of the two--Boondock Saints is a sure bet.",The Boondock Saints

I read the message boards of IMDB and I am shocked at the people who say that the movie is ""unrealistic"" and ""silly"". I wonder if they forgot that it's a movie! Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus were excellent. Their accents were great! Norman's did need a little work, but Mr. Flanery's Irish accent was very believable! I was amazed when I learned that he was from Texas. Willem Dafoe reeked of awesomeness! I think that his character being gay was a good touch, because not only did it create more tension between him and the Boston detectives, but it didn't portray him as a stereotypical, limp wristed fairy. The dialogue was great. The F-word, in my opinion, was not over used. That is the way that people talk. Not everyone curses that much, but I know lots of people who do. As far as Troy Duffy goes, he is just, for lack of a better word, awesome! With his weak salary he pulled off a magnificent film. This is NOT a Tarantino/Guy Ritchie rip-off. Frankly, if my name were used in the same sentence as Tarantino's, I would be flattered. But it's an insult to compare Duffy to the likes of John Woo. The movie was, again, excellent! I can not wait for the sequel to come out! I will be in line the second they start selling tickets!Aequitas Veritas!",The Boondock Saints
706,SaToolman185,Great Movie,10,2 March 2004,"I have seen this movie 3 times and i have bought it. It is one of the best movies i have seen. The reality of it is beleivable because i have a twin and we have a union some what like them just not as strong. In that aspect and others it is one of the best films i have seen. Also whats very unique about this film is the relegous aspect. The twins are very relegous and they go through great struggles throughout the movie but keep an upbeat attitude on life because of there relegin. And whoever thinks this movies sucks, Man take a look again cause if you'd sit down and watch this movie you'd know its one of the better movies that one's seen. I also like it alot cause it doesn't involve the devil. Most people would agree to this to cause we need to do something about the world cause every day it changes and we need to forget about the notion that our emotions are at bay cause there not and we need to take care of it. THANk YOU AND PLEASE WATCH THIS MOVIE.",The Boondock Saints
707,aequitas12,a great film,10,29 March 2004,"I felt that this was one of the most inspirational movies i have ever scene, Duffy's use of scene cutting and showing in reverse order opens new doors in cinematography. As well his very direct message about the legal system and the ethics of the masses today is a large step in bringing out a useful commentary of our society. Sean Patrick Flannery delivers a flawless performance, drawing you into the life of he and his brother, Norman Reedus. David Della Rocco adds a relief to the strong and serious nature of the film with his antics and surprises, he gives a truely high energy performance that will let you know that the part was truely written for him.",The Boondock Saints

The characters, the plot and the ""execution"" was among the best WD has ever done.  He is such a great actor!  This is one movie that people should watch and consider the plot in their everyday lives because we are living in such times now.  Why should we let the hoods controls us when WE are the ones that should be in charge.  If the people who we ""allow"" to protect us don't then we have the RIGHT to protect ourselves.

709,The-Haunted,"The man from Delmonte, He say 'Yes!'",10,25 March 2004,"Allow me to begin by pointing out that I am not some acne riddled teenager. After perusing the mass of reviews I found myself wondering 'Is there two versions of this film?'  More realistically, I fear the film being judged on the questions of morality it poses to the viewer?  Are you a person that believes in tough justice or are you one of those people that let their children do what ever they want because it 'helps their creativity' type cretins?  I advocate the 'spank the little sod and send them to bed' approach myself but that's for another forum.  If you are not of this ilk and you can't set aside your view point then you are not going to like this film.Firstly, the plot for the Saint's is both clever and provoking.  The 'anti-heroes' bungle their way through each encounter with a combination of luck and coincidence, or is it?  Perhaps there is some divine intervention at hand here after all.  This is something as a viewer you will need to decide.Secondly, I have seen from the other posts that there has been some rather savage criticism of the acting and characters, complete nonsense.  To my mind Special Agent Smeker is one of William Dafoe's greatest acting achievements.  The character is complicated and Dafoe manages to portray Smecker's intelligence and isolation with an Oscar worthy performance. Add to this the complicated social life of Smecker and the clever way it is portrayed without the need for acting like a lisping, limp wristed jesse and it is plain to see why Dafoe is rated as such a high calibre actor.  I can see why Rocco has been described as annoying but surely that is the idea of the character?  Just look to the way his peers treat him to see that he is despised and seen as weak and idiotic.  The man has spent 18 years in the mob and he still gets the boss's lunch.  Therefore, every criticism that calls Rocco 'over the top or 'Irritating' is an accolade to David Della Rocco's acting skills.  Without going into further detail it is sufficient to say that all other performances rate highly in my estimation.Finally with regards to the film be littered with expletives and gratuitous violence I can only question what films you have seen prior to The Saints? Was it Bambi or perhaps Legally Blonde 2?  If you look at those scenes labelled as violent you will see that they are actually very tame in comparison to films of a similar genre.  The brilliance of Troy Duffy's direction is most apparent in the way he delivers hard hitting scenes like the attack by Rocco in the dinner with a minimal use of blood and gore. Admittedly the overall effect is pretty harsh but when you compare it to Hannibal making someone eat there own brain it really is not that bad.  As for the swearing, I suggest you do not listen in to the vast majority of conversations I have on a daily basis with me colleagues.  We truly do make the Saints sound like the Angels they just might be.The Haunted made me do it!",The Boondock Saints
710,s_white1,Great film for all ethnic racists.,10,29 March 2004,"The story of Boondock Saints is about two Irish brothers who kill mobsters because God is telling them to. They enjoy drinking, fighting, and hanging out at the local pub. Being Irish myself I believe this movie is great for my heritage, particularily the part where the brothers and other Irish guys beat up three Russians in a bar. Talk about being labeled... and not only that it all happens in Boston, because honestly, where else does all the Irish blood originate from in America? I hope we now see a film where some Chinese-Americans go Kung Fu on some bad guys butts and eat rice... Lots and lots of rice... because that is all Chinese people do. Eat rice and practice Kung Fu/Karate/whatever.",The Boondock Saints
711,postaudiosound,"Not ""Sick""",3,6 February 2005,"I can almost guarantee you that any movie featuring Ron Jeremy is going to be sub-par on a number of levels. This is no exception - this movie nails about every cliché that hack writers have been working hard to create in the last decade. After being around film students for the last decade, I can assure you that this movie has been written hundreds of times by kids who have seen Pulp Fiction a dozen times too many. How this specific version was made beats me, but I can only assume that the director had a trust fund or slept with a Coppola. (Well, maybe more like an Arquette) You'll see dream sequences with slow motion rain, a detective who listens to opera while solving crimes, an insane madman in a Hannibal Lecter cage, a multitude of racial stereotypes... all infused with religion and extreme violence. Worst of all, the film (almost offensively) attempts to answer serious social questions in the end - in the lamest way possible, of course. I won't spoil it, but I'll say that any movie that ends with interviewing people on the street has failed to make its point.",The Boondock Saints

The acting is spectacular, the plot is unique, and the music is awesome.  The chemistry between Sean Patrick Flanery (Connor) and Norman Reedus (Murph) is incredible.  They act just like brothers, and (don't kick me for this) they are both friggin' hot. Hey, you know you think so too, so shut up.  Anyway, I had never heard of the movie until a friend of mine insisted I watch it.  Two days later, I was buying it off of EBay.  The best 10 bucks I've ever spent.  I'm now a total devotee of The Boondock Saints, and I'm always making people I know watch it.  So far, every single person has loved it.

I am not exaggerating, this movie is incredible.  The action sequences are phenomenal, the camera work is freely artistic, and the story is nothing short of original.  If you know anything about how challenging an independent film can be, you will appreciate how well Troy Duffy (writer/director) did with in this film. It has become a cult classic, I am yet to meet someone who dislikes this movie.Part of what makes this movie so amazing is that it wasn't released in the U.S. (due to the political climate) yet it is very popular.  This movie has made nearly all it's sales from the word of mouth of people just like you and me. So here I am telling you what a great movie this is, so go check it out. I won't lie, this movie is on the edge, it does cross lines for some people, but every great artistic masterpiece does.  To me The Boondock Saints is about brotherhood and the undying love Connor & Murph McManus have for each other. Check this film out, you won't be disappointed.One last thing, I am really looking forward to the sequel, ""The Boondock Saints 2: All Saints Day""  Good work Troy, make the sequel happen!",The Boondock Saints

Its not something high dollar with fancy smancy CGI stuntmen, a high profile director or producer, or a big A-list star, but it is entertaining. Defoe's role is great, except he get's a little too deep undercover a a certain point (which is hilarious). The whole Vigilante theme is really expanded on, and there's no ""love interest"" B.S. crammed down out throat as well. The ""FIREFIGHTS!!!"" are great, very old school action, lots of non-bullet-time, squib happy original action.BTW- If your Irish, you'll get a kick out of it.

716,theByramSaint,"Great Movie!small spoiler, but doesn't give anything away",10,2 June 2004,"As by my name, you can tell i liked the film. To say it is a great movie would be an understatement. I would say it is in my top 5 favorite movies of all time. If you are Irish, you WILL get a big kick out of The Boondock Saints. If you like action movies, this movie is the one to see. If you like comedies, this is a must. It is an action comedy much like that of the first and third Die Hard movies, ironically enough where the lead character is also Irish. But this film definitely ranks right up there with the Die Hard series. Since I am Irish (apparently people say i resemble Murphy McManus) and love action movies, The Boondock Saints is perfect. If you haven't seen it, DO! You will not be disappointed. The only thing I recommend is not watching it once and discarding it, but watching it once through, then watching it a second time which will help with flashback scenes and put the captions on. Sometimes the McManus brothers can sometimes be hard to understand, even though i should be used to the Irish accent. But theirs can often be reminiscent of Michael J. Fox's accent in Back To the Future part 3. But that passes due to the superior plot. The only hole in the plot that I can see, and people mention all the time, really isn't a hole at all. Let me give a SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!!!!! warning just in case it might give anything away (it doesn't but read at your own risk) .................................................... There has been a disagreement about the rope. If you pay attention, Murphy's rope begins to come untangled when they are above the elevator, and does get wrapped around them when they are fighting in the vent shaft. Watch it carefully.......................END SPOILER. Some of the acting may not be that good, such as David Della Rocco for most of the movie, but he does have some very funny parts. As for people saying they don't like the film because it is unrealistic, if you feel that way, then i would not recommend you see Ghostbusters or any superhero movies like Superman or Batman. Overall, The Boondock Saints is a great movie, and is like a mix of Goodfellas, the original Matrix, and Die Hard.",The Boondock Saints

I say those people are idiots who cannot use their imaginations to draw conclusions about the characters. The story with right where it should and follows it's course well.

Why not just tattoo ""badass experienced cop guy"" on his forehead? And him rippin' on the ""rookie cop"" cliché? Ha-ha, Dafoe makes fun of the rookie for no reason. Ugh...Ridiculous.And that ""what are you a fag?!"" line... Was that supposed to make me laugh?!And I didn't ""question my ethics and morals"" by the end of the film. These characters said they were on a mission from God. People who are on missions from God are CRAZY. Always. Yes, them too. So, yes, they're wrong. No, really, they are. Ugh, what a crappy movie. I cannot believe it has the rating it does. Are these the people who voted for Armageddon and Independence Day?To sum it up, this movie just feels so lazy to me.

It wouldn't be realistic without it.The plot is much like the typecast thrill/adventure film, but the theme of a mob/violent/shoot-em-up film. At the end you feel kind of strange because it is such a different kind of movie but you feel all good inside and protected. It leaves you wanting to do good and act in a moral manner.

Well written and beautifully acted (by beautiful actors..still single Sean Patrick Flanery??) this movie makes my all time top five. It was different to see Dafoe in the role he played but he pulls it off....fantastic job! The movie was perfectly casted. The on screen chemistry between the actors made a good, well written movie into a great one. I've recommended this movie to everyone I know..and thanks to IMDb..everyone I don't. :)I'm excited there will be a sequel! Can't wait!",The Boondock Saints
726,superjin7,We shall flow a river forth to thee...,9,11 September 2004,"***Contains Spoilers***This has probably been one of the most underestimated movies i've seen as of yet. Shadowing itself by being in the cheap priced movie rack, this movie just has something about it that makes me get chills when I see certain parts. Mostly the firefight between Il Duce and the Saints just stood out as far as making it seem so epic and holy. This movie, along with a pretty smooth soundtrack delivers the complete package: no bad ending that makes no sense, but one that leaves it wide open for All Saints Day that hopefully at least will make it to some sort of viewing. Not much else to add except, get this movie a higher score. I'd expect at least an 8.0...This is an original masterpiece people.",The Boondock Saints

You might be thinking if its so good, why didn't i hear about it? or why wasn't it in the movies? or why did rotten tomatoes give it such a bad review?well here are those answers!1. you didn't hear about the movie probably because there wasn't that much advertising/marketing for it. As far as i know. I could be wrong, i mean, I'm not a professional or anything, but this is just what i think. If you find out otherwise, please lemme know thanks.2.A. There are 2 different stories i heard for this. I was talking to a lady at blockbuster about the movie and she said that it never came out in the movies and that was because the ""producers/important people"" were afraid that it would influence too big of a crowd and people might imitate the movie.Possibly Causing The ""Producers/ Important People"" a lot of lawsuits.(You know how crazy the world is today and how people will sue over anything.) Well, OK thats sort of believable. But this isn't coming from a professional either, just a blockbuster employee yall, remember that.2.B. Another story i heard was that it did come out in the movies, except it didn't get much attention because it wasn't released everywhere, it was a ""limited release"", (meaning only playing at limited theaters) and also there was not much advertising or promotion for it. ya know, and i also heard that they might have had a short budget too.I've had enough, this movie is an all time monster! its the king of kings! I'm new here, so I'm just getting started, i plan on writing reviews for almost every movie! if you have my tastes and feelings on movies, then list me as one of your friends, if i find someone out there that has my tastes and feelings then I'm putting you as one of my friends, this way, if i see you rated a movie good, and i haven't seen it, then i will know to check it out!",The Boondock Saints

The bombacity of this movie was a breath of fresh air to the intellectually starved, and the wit of the movie was naught a perfect compliment to the action.Willem Dafoe, while not the prominent protagonist, did an excellent job of propelling this movie forward in the midst of transition. The actual dialogue between Dafoe and those around him, along with the Dialogue of ""The Saints,"" if you will, is naught but exemplary of how a script should be written.

In my top 5 fave movies, one of the few that I could sit and watch all day long and never get sick or bored of it! The poeticness of what the vigilantes are doing, riding the cities of the corruptness that has overtaken many cities. Getting rid of the reason why we are scared to allow our children into public schools, why we are frightened to walk down the street to go to the store, so instead we drive our cars. Why we can't let our children play outside without constantly watching them. I'm in fear of our society today, and this movie spoke to my heart of the justice that many of us long for. The irish brothers is the heart of what we as America felt when we were attacked 9-11. We all felt the vigilante in us rise up, and connect with our God, asking for the Great Spirits blessing while seeking revenge, as well as trying to rid the world of the corruptness it has been made to endure. Yes, this movie is about spiritual poetic justice, as was said in the movie, I'll say it now, as I believe this line full heartedly.

731,ohthehorrormanity,The Boondock Saints was lacking.,5,28 February 2006,"This movie could have been so great if not for some poor script choices and poor casting choices. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus as the MacManus brothers were wonderful. I loved how their relationship with one another played out. They were never TOO serious and you really felt a camaraderie with them as they progressed through the film. The faith they had in God and each other was inspiring. Of course they chose a strange course of action to deal with the ""baddies"", but they still made you feel for them and want them to succeed. Williem DaFoe as Paul Smecker was simply disturbing. The character was played like a crazy man and did not seem to tie into the rest of the film. Smecker went from the hard ass ""let's bring these assholes down"" to a big ol' softy who just wanted the brother's to carry on their good deeds. The transition happened too quickly. One minute he is after them and crazy and the next minute he is letting them go and crazier. The rest of the cast was lacking as well. David Della Rocco as Rocco gave a decent performance but the character seemed over the top. I did not really feel the friendship between the brothers and Rocco. It just did not seem to be there like it should have been. As far as the plot goes, the ending with II Duce being the brother's father was extremely cheesy, for lack of a better word. They have not seen Their father in over 20 years and immediately they have a close bond with him. They ""let him in the club"" so to speak. Regardless of the life their father led before he was imprisoned it just seems far fetched for him to be immediately accepted. They may have missed their father, and they may have not cared whether he was in prison or not, but the guy was gone for most of their lives. This is usually not accepted so easily. And here it just does not work.",The Boondock Saints
732,clarisrock,Themes of Justice in Saints,9,10 April 2013,"The Boondock Saints, a movie about Irish Catholic brothers who transform overnight from low wage workers to vigilantes after a series of unfortunate events turn them into local folk heroes and reveal to them what they believe is a divine mission to rid the world of evil men, brings into question traditional notions of justice and morality and ultimately poses the question of whether it is right to do evil in the name of good.After the brothers manage to kill two mobsters purely out of self-defense, they get elevated to a kind of hero status within the community and are dubbed ""saints"" and ""angels"" by the local paper.It is after they turn themselves in but are let go because the killings were clearly in self-defense that the brothers suddenly realize that it is their new mission to rid the world of evil men like the mobsters they killed. They conclude that it is their divine mission to fight against the indifference of good men by being proactive and killing the bad men. The movie calls into question traditional notions of justice by depicting faults in the two most commonly looked-to sources of justice: law and religion. Religion, one commonly recognized source of morality and for understanding what justice is becomes the vehicle that pushes them forward even though it's unlikely that any member of the church would support their actions as just. But, for the brothers themselves, every man they kill is killed in the name of the lord for the sake of justice. And perhaps there is some sort of divine intervention on their side because the brothers are allowed to magically escape unforeseen obstacle after unforeseen obstacle. Meanwhile their Italian friend, a low level mob member named Rocco, who joins with them for a time deciding that their plan and reasoning make sense to him, does not follow the same moral code and also does not receive the same kind of magical protection as the brothers.The justice of law is also critiqued in the film. The police and the courts are both depicted at different points as ineffective. The local police typically have no idea of what's going on. Detective Smecker is not nearly as inept as the local police. But, also is depicted as ineffective to a certain extent because for most of the movie, he is a step behind ""the saints"" and he is driven to the point of madness by his inability to catch them. However, once he does unravel the mystery, he then faces another crisis after concluding that ""the saints"" might be filling an important void by destroying the men that law enforcement has been unable to touch.There are also depictions of ineffectiveness with the courts. At one point, the movie shows a parole officer being bribed to allow a dangerous hit-man out on to the streets in order to eliminate the threat to the mob posed by ""the saints."" Later, in the last scene, ""the saints"" burst into a courtroom where a mobster is, according to onlookers, about to be found not guilty in order to kill him and make a public example of him.Ultimately, the movie gives no complete answer as to whether the actions of the brothers are just or unjust. Detective Smecker ultimately decides to help ""the saints"" with their mission but partially because he begins to help them and then feels that he has ""gone too far"" to stop. ""The Saints"" themselves even recognize their evil, giving a long public speech in the courtroom that all who ""cross over to true corruption"" have crossed ""into their domain."" In this sense, it seems that ""the saints"" do see their actions as evil but as a necessary evil. Wrong that must be done to combat other wrong. The credits roll while a news station shows average people debating the rightness or wrongness of ""the saints'"" actions. One person compares the saints to superheroes, stating that if the media continues to portray them as just, kids will soon have pictures of ""the saints"" on their walls next to Batman and Superman. In a way, this comment also suggests the truth of ""the saints,"" that though the violence is amplified and perhaps less glorified in their case, they are just like Batman and Superman. They are vigilantes who have taken the law into their own hand. And while superheroes are widely celebrated, the more macabre reality of vigilantism portrayed in The Boondock Saints helps the audience to realize that the reality of vigilantism isn't so black and white and the concept of justice is far more complicated than superhero movies would have you believe.",The Boondock Saints
733,kitten-39,there is nothing good about this movie,1,12 December 2004,"This film starts with a badly acted & scripted opening credits (which also have no significance to the movie) and then just gets worse and worse. How so many people can give it good reviews I just don't know. It tries to be funny, but none of the jokes are worth even a snigger, they are just crude and childish. All the comparisons to Pulp Fiction are because both films are violent and bloody; however unlike Pulp Fiction the violence here is unsubtle, unnecessary and handled amateurly. Indeed the whole film, from script, to acting, direction, lighting and editing is amateurish (and not in a good way at all). I don't care if it's the directors' first film & they had a tight budget, you can make a good film with a video-phone and match-stick men puppets if you at least have a good script. This sure didn't have a good script. The only thing consistent in this film is how bad it is all through. Actually i'm not sure about that because I could only manage to watch about half of it (and even that much was a real struggle). I've never posted on IMDb (in about 8 years of using it) before but after reading all the praise for this movie felt I had to register and post in the hope I'll save somebody else from wasting time on this drivel. I see (and am frankly amazed) that they are making a sequel, I think it'll be one of the first times a sequel is better than the original movie because I really don't think they could make it any worse.",The Boondock Saints

Willem Dafoe is wasted as a homosexual cop. The only decent part of the movie is the end, which I won't spoil. Just save to say the monologue is so poorly delivered I was actually laughing.

All of you who were raving about Tarantino; if you thought the Kill Bill movies were great (which they were), should we all assume you revel in blood lust? No! You can like a movie and still not want to live it. Which brings me back to my point, I loved this movie. I thought it was well-acted, hilarious, poignant, moving, and above all else, entertaining, which is all a movie ever needs to be. I thought there were times in the movie when the cinematography was unique and even a little bit wonderful. While I could see how some of the other critiques would write this film off as a Tarantino wanna-be, probably due, for the most part, to the cinematography, especially the scene sequence, I thought it was great. Jumbling the scenes was as integral to the plot as the lines of the script themselves. Duffy wasn't ripping off a great filmmaker, he was simply making a great film. I'm not going to get into my personal opinion on the message of the film, because that's not what this forum is for. All I'll say is that I loved the movie, and you really ought to see it, if for nothing else, because it raises some serious issues, and that alone makes it worth two hours of your time.

In my opinion the film was so interesting that I found my self watching it multiple times weekly, and sometimes daily. The film had a different twist than other typical action ""shootem-up"" movies. I'd have to say that writer and director dared to be different in the sense that they didn't want just an everyday ordinary crime movie.

740,RobbWood,"Had To Handcuff My Hands Behind My Back To Be Able To Finish This ""film.""",2,26 February 2005,"The Boondock Saints - ReviewOK, I looked up this film here on IMDb to surely see everyone giving this ""film"" the same type of bad review I am giving it. I was shocked to see that there are many out there who claim to love this film. How can that be? Did I unknowingly fall asleep after the opening credits and dream a really bad movie? I must have for my ""dream"" had so many things wrong with it. I will have to disagree with some of the people on here and say that in my opinion Willem Dafoe did not do a bad job of acting at all. He was unfortunately just badly directed. I find Mr. Dafoe to be a very skillful actor to be quite honest. The actors who played the two brothers I think did a good job for what they were given as well but that is where the accolades stop. The Italian ""funny"" guy who joined the brothers as well as the dumb, young detective were the true definition of bad casting and over acting - WAY over acting. I am a fan of Billy Connelly but do not feel this was the right role for him to break his usual comedic ways. Not that I felt he did a bad acting job at all, just that he was not given the on screen time and direction for him to display his talent. I know he has now been cast to reprise his role in All Saints with a more prevalent showing but with such a bad first film and a part two without Mr. Dafoe, I feel Mr.Connelly's talent and time will be wasted with this role. OK, back to bad casting... the rest of the cast was horrible. Yes, that's right I said it! Not just bad... horrible! Do you blame the actors? No, not all. You blame the casting director and the producers for green-lighting their choices. I mean really... Ron Jeremy? Give me a break! If a pretty face like Traci Lords can't successfully make it out of the porn world, what makes you think this hedgehog can? Also, can anyone tell me what making Mr. Dafoes character gay did to help the story? Could he have not been a great detective who enjoyed opera music without having him be gay? All that dancing in the alley and in front of the house was just too much. Shame on you Mr. Duffy! Alright I know I should stop now with this review but cannot as there are so many holes in the story as well. If these two brothers turned themselves in to the police in the beginning for killing those two Russian goons, then why was it so damn hard for anyone to figure out who was killing the REST of the Russian mafia? Supposedly the Boston P.D. in this film is beyond stupid but THAT stupid? I recommend the city of Boston view this movie and consider banning Mr. Duffy from filming there again. So, OK, I'll go along though just for kicks. Boston is stupid and can't figure it out, OK.... but what about Detective Dafoe? So smart yet so naive? It just does not make sense. The only reason in my opinion that the director and writer, Mr. Troy Duffy, plotted it so is only to fill the hour and a half he needed to. This film ended when the brothers walked into the police station. The next hour and fifteen minutes were a waste of film, time (mine included), and money. I read in another persons review that this movie kept them on the edge of their seat. Well, I will have to agree, it did me too but only because I was handcuffed.I hope I have given you a glimpse into this horribly acted, poorly casted, badly written Tarintino rip-off. As much as I have written on it, it is just that, a glimpse. I can only recommend this as a fun venture ... to find some of the many other flaws I did not list.

Poor acting, bad writing and aimless script aside, the film's worst sin is how badly it wants to be cool/funny/stylish and how miserably short it falls of that goal. The tattooed, hard-drinking, wise-cracking anti-heroes. The gay FBI agent who gyrates to Italian opera as he combs crime scenes (nice disc player, by the way). The Ron Jeremy cameo.

744,soccergurl1187,Best Movie of the 90s... Well Close Enough,10,27 September 2013,"Finally, an action movie that has action throughout with no boring dialogues or ridiculously long chase scenes just for filler. 14 years after the release ""The Boondock Saints"" can still hold its ground as an action movie, by still being found in college dorms across the US and also being known as one of the better indie films of the 90's. ""The Boondock Saints"" is a hipster, cult-classic that will keep you engaged throughout with its intriguing non-linear storyline and fitting soundtrack.The non-linear storyline is what truly makes ""The Boondock Saints"" a refreshingly different action movie. To begin the non-linear sequence of events, the audience is shown the aftermath of the MacManus brothers' (Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus) handiwork; bodies, blood, bullets, etc. Then arrives Agent Smecker (Willem Dafoe) who narrates and theorizes what he believes happened to the victims. While he is doing this you see, as an overlay type of cinematography, how the whole scenario indeed went down with the brothers punishing their victims. Not only are the non-linear scenes done craftily, but they actually work with the movie as a whole and are easy for the viewer to follow.The soundtrack is one of the most important things to get right when making a movie and the sound editor for ""The Boondock Saints"" got it right. The opening view of the city of Boston was the best example of a music score fitting perfectly into a scene. Starting off the movie by showing the scenery of where the movie takes place while being paired with an upbeat Irish gig brought the whole movie into being. Slower paced scenes had just the right amount of quieter and somber music for it to fit the scene and not distract the viewer from what is taking place on the screen. In the fast and upbeat scenes the music was just as rapid and buoyant as the characters, which enabled it to fit perfectly with each of their movements. And while Smecker is theorizing the investigation scenes there is classical music that is orchestrated perfectly with the actions of both Smecker and the brothers as the flashbacks arise. The music itself could stand alone as being superb, but when matched perfectly into a scene it makes for a better viewing experience.With so many action movies these days being filled with over the top action and too many special effects, going back to ""The Boondock Saints"" is a sigh of relief. The director, Troy Duffy, was able to show that movies can still be engaging and fulfilling to watch even if it is not what we find to be traditional in the action genre today.",The Boondock Saints

A couple of scenes are very surprising like Dafoe in bed with another man, or Dafoe in a dress... but watching Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus is enough to make any girl happy.

They don't wait for someone else to address the situation. Rocco was right, they should be in every major city. The director, Troy Duffy, is an amazing, very generous guy. He is actually allowing me and a friend to use one of his phrases in the movie for the name of our own film productions group.

I can almost hear the director coming all over himself. ""Cult movie"" or not, this is ridiculous and a total waste of time. It's so full of itself as to suggest pretension. I'd have to say the historical inaccuracy got to me the most.Note to the director- Hey. You may have some Irish descent (wowie!), but you must get used to the fact that you've been doing fine all your life (no gangs or drugs, a life in the suburbs) and that most people of Irish descent don't glamorize it the way you do.

This movie usually is on our ""to do list"" of movie underdogs when me and some friends are having a relaxed DVD evening.Now since I've actually read 50 to 60 percent of all the reviews here at IMDb.com, I feel the need for sharing my thoughts on this movie with you.First of all, it's definitely NOT ""the best movie I've ever seen"" or ""the greatest film in history"". But it's also not ""total crap"" or ""OMG, I crapped my pants because this flick sucks THAT much"".""The Boondock Saints"" is a rather enjoyable movie, with some bright moments- as well as some setbacks. But hey, give me ONE single perfect movie. I would not go so far as to compare it to any Tarantino productions. Tarantino's got a unique style nobody can ever dream of achieving. But other directors, e.g. Tim Burton also have unique style, and still people try to imitate theirs.So please, no more ""Tarantino rip-off"" comments from self- proclaimed ""movie fans"". If you think that e.g. every bible-reciting or praying gunman is a ripoff of S.L.Jackson's Jules, go and bash ""Saving Private Ryan"". Jackson (Barry Pepper) is constantly praying when he's sniping German soldiers. BEWARE! Tarantino RIP-OFF! BAAAD MOVIE! *lol* The main issue behind ""The Boondock Saints"" is basically the transition between good and evil. When does a good man begin to become evil, what does it need for an evil man to become good again? That's the thing. If this movie gets people to think about that, it's worth its salt.

Boondock II: All Saints Day is the title of the sequel to The Boondock Saints.

I would completely loose faith in the world if it didn't. I wish it had been theatrically released though.

760,dawn-francey,"A proper ""grown-up"" movie",10,31 March 2005,"I am getting pretty stalled of late watching ""adult"" movies rated at 15 (UK), when along comes this well scripted, well written, excellently directed and produced and phenomenally acted fantastically violent adult movie. This to me ranks up there with other movies like True Romance for the quirky script and the ""we've known each other forever"" interaction between the three Saints. The script is well written with black comedy undertones that give you a chuckle. The cast band it about like its really happening and no acting is going on at all. In fact you get completely lost in it.What starts out as a chance happening turns into a solid action movie that at times had me wondering ""is this real"". I like the one thing leads to another feel from this movie. Don't get me wrong most of the time you don't see whats coming but on occasion you do but it doesn't spoil the enjoyment, you get the ""oh no, they aren't gonna do that"" factor and are exhilarated when they do. Willem Dafoe is great in his part - something really different for him. For us girls Conor and Murphy are just to die for - their sense of right and wrong lends to a show of a male feminine side, tied up with all that machismo, has me swooning. This film should get the vote for the ugliest ""woman"" on film. All I can say is bring on number 2! I cant believe I only just found this film. My regret is that I didn't know about it sooner.

However, should you be a fan of the shooting/action genre, I believe the movie will well be worth the investment.

765,alexchouinard,"A thoroughly enjoyable, albeit, violent and slightly silly film.",8,26 August 2014,"First, let me start with the bad and why there are so many haters to the film. *spoilers My biggest complaint is the campy use of eye prosthetics in the hotel scene, somewhat repetitive crime scene shots and.... well i'm having trouble thinking of more. Some film snob pucker butts will draw attention to the films morality and plausability as flaws. However, if (as the story alludes) divine forces are at play, surviving a 5 story fall and not being able to shoot your father in a point blank shootout become excusable if not necessary for the storyline. The snobs will also say the ethics of the brothers/Italian cohort are questionable, I excuse those flaws in the same way I excuse The Blues Brother's antics to save an orphanage. Imperfect people doing divine work in an imperfect way. Thats the storyline and if you cant get behind that, then skip the movie, but don't be a hypocrite and praise films like Clockwork for their social commentary while panning this one as slowmotion execution porn. Phew, that was a rant.Now the good. If I were ranking this film soley on ""watchability"" I would have given it a 10. The main cast play well off each other and although im just a lowely pion to a snob with a PHD in film studies, I found the acting between the main cast to be superb. I thought Dafoe was over the top marvelous with his semi-tribute semi-ripoff of the DEA agent in Leon the Professional. The Italian cohort was genuinely manic, funny, disgusting, and almost tragic in a charming way. While the brothers killed it with the love they show for one another (even if their accents were a bit too much lucky charms mascot inspired). The dialogue was witty and funny. The action sequences were better and more creative then most action movies wth twice the budget.

In one of the first sequences of the movie of the bothers rips a toilet out of the floor with his bare hands, drops it out of his fourth story window on to a mobster's head, and proceeds to jump out of this window. He survives with only minor cuts and bruises. That alone would raise a skeptical eye, but then there's the acting and characters.Every character in the movie from the unrealistically intelligent-cross dressing-over the top FBI agent to the dull charaictures that are the protagonist is ridiculously ill thought out. Having terrible dialog doesn't help flesh out these characters either. I certainly don't mind cursing in a movie, but hearing the f-word repeated the upwards of 3 times in one sentence isn't only unoriginal, it's immature.

The viewer follows the plight of the brothers, they are faced with the question (among others) ""Is it one's right (or duty) to destroy evil people?"". Meanwhile, The FBI investigator is facing plenty of trying question of his own ""Should I stop good men from doing good things in the world despite laws when it is my SWORN duty to uphold the Law?"" Are they killing for kicks? Or are they truly utilized by God (as they begin to feel they are)? Will they be killed while carrying out their duties? Will they be caught first? If so, what will happen to them? Since its quiet release in 1999, the Boondock Saints has exploded in cult popularity. The reasons for this are hardly elusive. The plot is compelling, well paced, and keeps it in the DVD player. In addition to executing humor drama and action expertly, it also posses strong and pressing questions regarding religion, justice, capitol punishment, and an array of other heavy topics.The Characters are lush and vibrant; bringing the film to life. And these wonderful characters are spawned souly from the incredibly talented (and mostly under-rated), and well casted actors. Particularly film-legend Willem Defoe illuminates the screen in this title.The profanity soaked dialog is not for the faint of heart however, but laced with brilliance non the less.The action is fresh, less than predictable, and expertly carried out (though obscenely violent).Short comings: The plot is some what typical or unoriginal, but highly entertaining still, thanks to a few creative spins they threw into the runofthemill story - The violence, language and mild nudity may offend some - Some events of the film feel rather far fetched at times, and less than believable - VERY male dominated (they even punch a violent feminist at one point) If you loved this film, the sequel 'All Saints Day' has been announced.",The Boondock Saints

""The Boondock Saints"" is 2 hours of constant obscenity and violence, never pausing to explore a character, or contrast the mood of the film. Every scene however is loud, bloody, and shallow. The film's philosophical premise is strong, analyzing the nuances of vigilante justice, but nuance and complexity are very difficult to discover when the characters are so simple and distracted by the frequency of extreme words and action.

Its the only real GUY movie with a strong homosexual theme and really maintains that man's masculinity while not making it into one of those preachy movies that press an agenda. I like it. I bought it. I watch it. I enjoy it.",The Boondock Saints
780,peterscraig78,One of the smartest things Hollywood has ever done was to blacklist this film...,1,9 August 2005,"With out a doubt one of the worst films of all time! it is dreadful!! Truly! not one of the characters have anything to them. The whole premise is incredibly weak. The dialogue is without any merit or reason. It's simply lots of swear words in an attempt to seem gritty and tough when in truth its clearly just someone with out any talent or voice as a writer using f**k coz he hasn't got anything else to say. It really did feel like a film written by a particularly untalented 12 year old boy that gets bullied at school every day. There is nothing of merit or even sense to this. This man has no talent!! And as a director... Jesus! His cast is so lost to the point where even the likes of experienced Willem Dafoe is just wondering around, jumping on tables and pulling strained faces just in an attempt to give the non character..... something, anything. But even he can't do anything but look really uncomfortable and out of place. Troy Duffy isn't Tarantino. Killing people on screen and smoking cigarettes doesn't make you a good writer. And he isn't even in the same league as Guy Ritchie, who he obviously tried to steel from just before he began photography. Guy Ritchie has a consistency to his films and isn't confused about weather it is a cartoon gangster tale, or a down and dirty gritty morality tale. Even Over Board was better than this utter bilge, in fact The Boondock Saint makes Over Board look like Dr Strangelove. There is absolutely nothing about this film to redeem it. Its not even enjoyably bad. It's beyond painful and at just over one and a half hours it feels like one of the longest films you'll ever force your self to sit through. If you are thinking of spending any hard earned cash to see this, or even not so hard earned... or even, for that matter, if some one is offering to pay you to watch it, don't. The only way I could possibly suggest that you do is if you were one of the few that actually like the Ronny Wo turd The Fifty First State. If, indeed, that person even exists!

Sean Patrick Flanery is breathtaking. Norman Reedus is charming, and the chemistry between the two brothers in the story is great. Billy Connolly is scary. The violence is necessary (in my opinion.)

784,ironsamurai666,Vigilantism at Its Deadliest,10,16 August 2006,"There's a name that movies like this fall under: Tarantino. But this one isn't by that guy that directed Pulp Fiction or Reservoir Dogs; it's directed by Troy Duffy(""who?""). Yes, and its a pity Mr. Duffy was such a jerk, or else he would be cashing in on this outstanding films success a bit more.Oh well, enough of that, onto the actual review. Quite simply, ""The Boondock Saints"" is one of the best vigilante movies I've seen in my life. Now we all love Batman and the Punisher as established icons who each have years of history behind them, and Sin City takes the cake in style as much as the next guy, but if you try to label or compare these films to Saints, you'll come up dry. What Mr. Duffy did was take concepts of vigilantism, revenge, religion, brotherhood, and good old right-and-wrong, and he rolled them up into 110 minutes of an excellent film.It's the story of two Irish brothers, who are slapped in the face with a mission they both feel they must carry out after they are forced to kill two Russian mobsters in self-defense. They get off, but they realize that what they've just done is remove a threat to their South Boston neighborhood's streets, and they want to do it again and keep doing it. They eventually recruit their Italian friend, Rocco to help them. Rocco contrasts heavily with the brothers' cool, impersonal demeanors and approaches to killing, and this brings them at odds with each other.Also a major player in the storyline is the gay, classical music loving FBI Agent Paul Smecker, who is Willem Dafoe in another five-star performance. Smecker remains in conflict with himself throughout the film, as is evident in Dafoe's expressive acting. He doesn't want to bring these guys in, as he feels they're doing something necessary: cleaning up the messes in society that the law can't. By the end of the movie, his conclusion is--(that would be telling wouldn't it?).Added to that, the highly skilled hit man, Il Duce, is sent after the Saints (as reporter Sally McBride--peppered throughout the course of the film--refers to them). He remains a mystery until one of the final scenes in the Italian don's house. Who he really is may be a predictable twist, but it is done in a way that is both meaningful and works so well in context that it doesn't take away from the film's style or innate majesty.People will also criticize the violence of the movie, but, in what is arguably one of the most surreal scenes of the film, keep an eye on Dafoe as he plays Smecker, who, though not personally involved, appears to be directing the bloodletting as a conductor of an orchestra. The difference is all in the presentation. We could watch a movie like ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Sin City"" and their hyper violence and in-your-face presentation of the violence is construed as tasteful, but with classical music playing in the background and a conductor who appears too into his job is seen as ""excessive""? Please, you're a hypocrite if you don't criticize the violence in ""Pulp Fiction"" but you do criticize it in ""Saints"". The fact is, the exposition (and the music) reminded me more of a John Woo scene than anything else; I half-expected doves to fly up around them when they started shooting. The scene immediately after when the three effectively licked their wounds was excellently acted and shot, as well, even if you didn't find the last scene in your taste.At the end of the day, it puts forth the question, ""Are vigilantes necessary or correct in society."" Some will say it's pro-vigilantism, some say the opposite. Personally, I think it splits us down the middle. Either way, the message the Saints give at the end of the film is one of the most memorable in the genre's history, and that in itself is commendable in this film, and makes it worth the last 100 minutes of your life.The best part of the film is why it's ""vigilantism at its deadliest."" They allow us to answer the question of vigilantism it presents, instead of telling us whether it's right or wrong.",The Boondock Saints

I really enjoyed the camera, it was never still, and the movie itself, where can I begin? Right off the bat, you know it kicks ass. It gets right to the point and never goes off point.

It seems like it was written by a bunch of 12 year old boys in detention. It's also somewhat demented. At one point, the end, they torment a man before they kill him and for some reason it takes 3 people with 3 guns several bullets to the head to kill him.

788,donalglackin,A True Classic,10,6 May 2006,"I was in America on Holiday about three years ago. I was staying in New Orleans with a friend and for a week we went to stay with his family in Florida. Him and his cousins kept ranting and raving about this film about two Irish-American brother, Conor and Murphy McManus, and couldn't believe that I had never heard of it never mind seen it. That film was The Boondock Saints. I watched and was amazed. The film was absolutely amazing. The story revolves around two deeply religious Irish-American brother who are put 'in an extra-ordinary situation' and end up on top. They then receive a message from God and decide to go on a mission to protect the innocent ... by punishing the wicked. Together with their friend Rocco, excellently played by David Del La Rocha, they track down the drug dealers, the mobsters, the phedos and punish them with biblical styles justice. However they are tracked by the master assassin The Duce, played by a seriously amazing Billy Connelly, and the brilliant detective, played by Willem Defoe in my favourite performance he has ever made. Fans of Connelly will be amazed by how he plays the serious character instead of the 'funnyman'.I've never seen a film that mixes seamless action and asks the highest moral question. Should the wicked and evil be punished by death? Much like Japanese cinema the film leaves this question on the table and while the film does not answer this question it poses it in such a manner that you can't help but think about it. Yes this film is has a lot of gore but it is not gore for gores sake. It is realistic. It makes you feel for these brothers. While one brother is being trailed off to be executed the other is handcuffed to a toilet. The love is so strong Conor tries to pull his hands through the handcuffs, blood gushing he manages to break the toilet. Only to go and jump off a roof to save his brother.Moreover the film has a wicked sense of humour. De La Rocha is hilarious and the interaction between the three main characters is oft times inspired. Watch out for the scene with the cat, comic genius. This movie has something for everybody and don't be put off by the religious tone set in the movie. Watch this movie, it is quite simply a true classic.",The Boondock Saints

790,johnbgon,Cinematic Abortion,1,17 December 2009,"The Boondock Saints was released in 1999 and ushered in a fan base possessing cinematic principles rivaling those of The Godfather Part III supporters.This heap of thrown together crime drama is brimming with horrendous plot elements and is accompanied with ear-raping dialog that ultimately appealed to a thoughtless audience, easily enticed with the notion of guns, violence, organized crime, and being 'cool'.There is not one redeeming factor to this film. And so begins a rant with just a few of the fallacies of the movie: it was extremely ridiculous that the Irish superhero would know where the Russian Mob evildoer would take his brother. Yet somehow he does and meets him there with porcelain.It was not 'cool' or 'awesome' when the audience is introduced to Dafoe's character dancing around a murder crime scene (ooo ahhh its so remarkably well thought; his methods are so unorthodox, but doggone it do they work) in addition to the subsequent banter that took place between the (painstakingly made aware) more experienced Dafoe and a lesser-experienced detective.The gun battles were absolutely ludicrous. The battle between them and the individual sent to kill them was mind-numbingly lame. The main characters stand perfectly still in the fight and yet the world-class sharpshooter assassin is unable to land a fatal shot on either of them.Their reconnaissance mission through the air duct in which they are arguing about rope was vomit inducing. Oh wow, that's so absurd they are arguing about rope. Actually, it's not. It's sad and it's lame.Ron Jeremy is in it; Dafoe cross dresses and subsequently canoodles with an Italian man; fun stuff, a wacky adventure straight from the dust-ridden pages of the mystery gang's Shaggy and Scooby Doo.The entire experience felt like a bombast attempt to make a crime movie akin to Goodfellas, The Godfather, Miller's Crossing, or Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs; yet it failed miserably and formed the on-screen abortion it is today.

The acting in this was absolutely appalling, the story was vaguely interesting but very poorly executed and quite frankly I want my 2 hours back. It was as if the director came up with a bunch of original characters but tried to fit in too many for one movie. And I guess he must have been influenced by Tarantino's style judging by how the movie jumps around the place, but for me it just looked pathetic. I would almost like to give this movie a 2 just for the scene with the cat in the flat as that did make me laugh, but again, this is clearly borrowed from Pulp Fiction and the fact that I have now even had to mention one of the best movies around in the same paragraph as this movie makes me angry.

Willem Dafoe has some of the best scenes; he is by far the most reliable actor in the film.The violence for the most part is very well shot, and (while unrealistic) is fun to watch. Hyper-violence on point.Intriguing setting; the Irish-Catholicism is a cool theme.Billy Connelly has a great screen prescence, and he seems the most Irish out of all of them (despite being of Scottish descent himself.)Cons:
None of the actors can seem to keep their accents consistent! This can be extremely distracting and unintentionally laughable.The character of Rocco is extremely annoying and unnecessary. He gets in the way of the development of the two brothers, and he is far less interesting then them. I found myself wishing he would die so we could move on to more interesting characters.The editing can be sloppy, and the cinematography led to some confusion.The Irish culture is not portrayed very well, and is definately made from an American perspective; one that doesn't truly understand the culture.Overall:

It has a good amount of acting as well as dialogue. Della Rocco is quite effective, despite his immaturity as an actor. Reedus and Flannery do a respectable job, and they really fit the stereotypical ""closet killer/ don't judge a book by its cover"" look. Willem Dafoe is amazing as usual, and if you are not sold on him being an amazing actor, this movie will definitely incline you to think that way. The best thing about the whole ""against great odds""/assassin genre is the making sure that the characters death defying stunts are believable. When the brothers fall out of the ceiling, with their ropes on their backs, I find it quite unbelievable that the rope could have possible hooked on to anything (let alone, something strong enough to hold their collective weight). The use of religion unexpectedly symbolizes the false sense of religious activism, that we see in todays society. The whole concept of the assassinations being done through FBI agent Smecker's eyes is a very good one. Anyhow, this is a good movie, and it is a shame that it didn't get the initial exposure that it shouldve received. The sequel will undoubtedly be well received by the public.

God had an Angel of death, and these two brothers, Irish Cathlic none-the-less, find that God has chosen them to be his dealer of death in this movie, and there is the complexity of once someone kills, be it for good or evil, that one becomes evil. Thou shalt not Kill. But EVIL people need to die, it's really that simple... I firmly agree with the movie, however a ""scale"" of evil is never truly placed... there is a line, its boundaries are vague ""we urge you lesser forms of filth to not push the boundaries into our domain true corruption."" If in fact death is dealt to those that are evil, so that they may come to be judged, and they atone their sins with God, who then Exonerates them, it is not an issue of moral rights and wrongs, it is an issue between them and God, and it only reminds me of a scene of Man on Fire with Denzel Washington, when asked ""Isn't up to God to Judge men"" he responded ""Yes, its just up to me to arrange the meeting.""

803,yz7746,a premise not a movie,4,13 January 2006,While very stylistic it lacks substance such as character development and a more cohesive structure that would allow the viewer to become more engaged with the film. It instead remains the stringing together of flashy scenes without much if any coinciding explanation. The director relies on alternate camera techniques and freeze frames to make up for the lack of real plot. It has achieved success as a cult hit mainly due to the controversy that surrounded the film as it was kept under wraps because its original release date's proximity to the columbine incident.

804,brandt2-1,Unknown-named Irish guy,5,17 January 2007,"Why does the killer Irishman just suddenly go from being employed by the mafia to siding with the McManus brothers? Just because he heard them saying an Irish prayer and it made him realize he should change his ways? The movie started well, but its ending was ludicrous. I have the feeling this was one of those movies where the screenwriter thought he had a cool idea at the beginning and just didn't know how to end it. What are viewers supposed to be left thinking with those news interviews at the end? Are we supposed to side with the Saints? Because there's nothing in the movie other than the people at the end that would indicate that their way of thinking is flawed, which it is.I like the moment where one of the brothers (and yes, they are indistinguishable, which makes them crappy characters) tells everyone in the courtroom not to kill, steal, or rape. Then he proceeds to kill a man. Good work not contradicting yourself, buddy. If he read the bible as faithfully as he acts like he does, he'd know that Jesus did not go around blowing people away. Not just because guns didn't exist 2000 years ago, but because that's not what He is about.And like some other people said... Who would look at Willem Dafoe girl-style and believe that is a woman? The same percentage of a population that would believe that white kid in Black Face was really black: zero. Plus what's with making him gay? I have nothing against homosexuals, but his scene with the Asian guy that he calls a faggot adds nothing to the movie other than humor. It does prove that Willem Dafoe is a walking contradiction. . . A cop who supports vigilantism, a homosexual who calls his boyfriend a faggot.And if his character is a contradiction on purpose, then what's the point of the movie? The point would be that people who go on crusades like that are idiots, and I'm pretty sure that's not the point of the movie, judging by how that point of view is not held by any character.",The Boondock Saints

I had to smile to myself and proceeded across town desperately looking for another copy.I should have stopped looking then.Let's get the obvious right out of the way. Don't worry about spoiler warnings. You've seen it all before. Boondocks Saints is a cut-and-paste version of better movies and blatantly lifts dialog from another films. (ie ""No women. No kids."") Mentioning these directors or comparing this movie to others would be a disgrace. You want to compare this film to something? Feed a baby some Ex-lax and watch what comes out. It'll be the Boondock Saints.Director Patrick Duffy also squandered a great opportunity to explore a somewhat complicated premise. In today's society, is murder ever justified? By Hollywood standards, this would constitute a real head-scratcher, but instead you get the some old cliché explanations and the movies marches forward looking for another opportunity to drop the F-bomb. I still don't know why the two protagonists even did what they set out to do.However, Boondock Saints does sets itself apart the other films it's desperately trying to emulate. At least twice toward the end of the film, the screenwriter implores the viewer to emulate the main characters and makes an argument for killing ACCUSED criminals. Not convicted criminals or prisoners mind you but perceived criminals. Twice the movies says: ""we should have two of you in every town"" and twice mentions recruiting others to their cause.You want to make dumb mindless action movie that depicts the killing drug dealers, rapists and contract killer, be my guest. Go right ahead. Make a dozen of them and I'll wish you luck every step of the way. Just don't insinuate that the audience should pick up a gun when they leave the theater.After watching this movie, I learned that Boondock Saints was blackballed from theaters in 1999 for unknown reasons and the movie only opened on 5 screens. Hollywood hasn't done many things right over the years but shelving this cinematic mistake was step in the right direction.Thinking of renting Boondock Saints? Heaven help us all.",The Boondock Saints
807,tanyarobin,Bloody Fun,8,11 November 2007,"I liked it. Not much more I can say. I don't get into all the hoo haw about the directing, the lighting, the editing and all that stuff. I focus on two things, acting...(and by acting I mean, did they do a good enough job that they brought me in?), and whether I was entertained.In this particular case, yeah, I was entertained. In fact, I couldn't take my eyes off of it, and I didn't want it to end. I kept wanting to see the crime scenes, see Smecker give his interpretation, and then find out exactly what happened.I hated when the kitty was killed, but I couldn't help but laugh when Rocco asked if they thought it was dead...or more so in the next scene when they eloquently hung up a picture over the 'mess' on the wall. The humor was extremely subtle and well used.I was shocked at the fact that DeFoe was gay, but couldn't help but laugh when he called his partner a fag, and accused the bartender of being a femme. That's funny stuff.It was good, it was entertaining, and I thought it was smart.That is all.",The Boondock Saints
808,ScottyStud,What a great movie!,10,24 January 2006,"This movie was so perfectly laid out. Everything they did tied in with something later on in the movie. The casting for this movie was above par if you ask me, the detective was so good at what he did. There are so many good lines to recite and say over and over again from that movie alone. The way the brothers have so much love for one another, just shows that family does come first. They definitely showed that they will do anything for one another, even if it means dying. This movie had everything in it, drama, comedy, suspense, and violence, which I think make a great movie. There's another thing from that movie that blew me away and that was the music. The music that was chosen for it was perfect and you couldn't get any better then the music they had. Catch you on the flip side!",The Boondock Saints
809,phesmerga,Great Movie,10,5 March 2006,"I thought it was a great movie. I loved it. Yes, a lot of college students love it... but what college student doesn't like some violence? I think the reason most people don't like the movie is because they don't get it. OK, it didn't have the best acting in the world. But that's what a cult movie is all about anyways, right? I think you actually have to WATCH this movie to like it. Get into the story line... get into the characters. I think that's the only time a movie is good... when you can get into it. For me it was easy to get into this movie. It was rather comedic, the main characters were down-to-earth and not some kind of super human killing machines, they had a reason to kill (doing gods work), and the scenes of killing shown through the detective's point of view was great.",The Boondock Saints
810,coloradoseasons,Big waste of time boring and weird,1,5 October 2018,"I love crime thrillers like ""Heat"" and the summary of this movie sounds exciting. Wha a let down. Movie is a bit slow - not action packed as people describe it. De Foe's character is supposed to be witty and brilliant but comes across as just weird and boring. Pass on this one. Can't believe all the rave reviews.",The Boondock Saints
811,momchilyordanov,Personal favourite since long ago,8,22 October 2018,"You know, this movies attracts a lot of mixed reviews, which I guess is normal. Personally, I've been in love with the flick ever since I saw it the first time and have continued to be so, even after watching it a dozen times. I can understand some of the negative comments in terms of ""unbelievability"" and ""exaggeratedness"" of the action scenes and whatever, but in keeping with the this Ritchie-Tarantino style (of which this movie for sure fits in), it doesn't seem so over the top. Sure, some stuff doesn't make sense in real life, but whatever, the movie carries an unmistakable allure, both in terms of the topics it touches on, the violence, the dialogue, and the humor. For me a cult classic! 8/10 and definitely worth a (re-)watch.",The Boondock Saints
812,Siress-1,My favorite movie for the past 4 years straight.,10,20 February 2006,"All the little things in this movie make it what it is. There's so many layers of reference that if you don't catch on early you'll be completely lost. I find myself watching it again about once ever 6 months; and it's the only movie I can watch more than twice. The way the producer lays the story out is so original that it's the best part of the cinematography. Also, the lack of technology is kind of refreshing. Not because I'm sick of technology (I'm pretty much a geek), but I'm sick of the fake crap most movies have in them. (Swordfish, remember the computer with eight monitors?! Please! No use for that what so ever.) The actors chosen really bring the movie together. William Dafoe gives a performance careers are made from, just too early for its time. (Now there's some queer movie about cowboys... Broke back Mt. or something. John Wayne is clawing his way out of his grave.) In short, it's the only movie I force my friends to watch. However, a couple of them haven't shown my love for the film.-Siress",The Boondock Saints
813,lorishaneck,check out the deleted scenes for their mother's phone call,10,15 March 2006,"I don't understand why this scene was not included in the film. It would have helped with background to the story. Willem Dafoe outshines the rest of the cast with this performance. It is hard to believe David Della Rocco is not in any other movies. He is great!! Everyone has a friend like Roc-this movie would not have the same impact without this character. Would like to see this guy in a few more movies. Why hasn't a sequel ever been made? It sure is a good story line worthy of returning to. Obviously, casting Ron Jeremy as a lowlife was the right choice. He truly fits the part. F@@@A@@ added authenticity and quite a few laughs to boot.",The Boondock Saints
814,kjelltony-1,Surprise of surprises!,9,31 March 2008,"In the summer of 2000 a friend of mine and i participated in a musical in our hometown in Sweden, and was assigned to guard duty since we were playing in a circus-tent. We had made a sport out of bringing movies neither one of us had heard about. One night one of us, i don't remember who, brought ""The Boondock Saints"". I think i speak for the both of us when i say that neither one of us has been so surprised, nor before - nor after, by a movie. Superb tempo, beautiful photo, great acting, excellent casting and a ""happy go lucky"" kind of violence that just puts a smile on your face.My favorite scene is when Agent Smecker, played by Willem Dafoe, is telling his partners how the gunfight between ""The Saints"" and ""Il Duce"" went down. The ""Memento"" style of shooting that scene is just plain awesome.Some other ""pearls"" is when Rocco brings closure to his cat and when Smecker cuddles with his boyfriend.If you haven't seen this movie, i envy you because your in for a joyride.",The Boondock Saints
815,christofer-frey,What a Long Strange Trip Its Been,3,2 March 2006,"The reason I rented the Boondock Saints is because I saw a little documentary called ""Overnight"" about the madness of King Troy. A hilarious (although poorly put together) telling of how Troy Duffy, a local douche-bag, gets the chance of a life time when Hollywood Titan Harvey Weinstein comes down from on high to declare Troy's ""The Boondock Saints"" the bees knees of new scripts in Hollywood and the world. Sending Troy into a ego-frenzy and his, ponderously terrible, band (called, jeez Louise! The Boondock Saints!) into the seven circles of record label hell. Needless to say, the fate of all douche-bags, like Oedipus Rex, is foretold from the start. Troy falls from grace, Harvey passes on his movie, his crappy band breaks up after their laughable debut (I mean who needs more Metal dudes playing folk music?), and Troy is seen outside a dive bar talking to his imaginary friend. To complete the circle, I rented Boondock Saints last night. My brother said he liked it and ,""Its about Massholes."" And it is! But I only thought the circle was complete. Then I saw how many people actually liked this skid mark of a movie in the comments section of IMDb. And the people who hated it, put the hate on it in a really lame way. So I decided to write my own.Here goes! This movie was made by that guy in your local bar whose just a little older than you, stole your bike, and beat up your younger brother. He gets ostentatiously drunk, because its the only thing he is good at. He is short and wears overalls, because that makes him hard! He's also wicked retarded! Just like this movie. But that is no reason to avoid this movie. I want everybody to see it! ITS FANSTASTIC!!! The plot reads like a crappy Vertigo comic, SO trying to break the norm. With main characters that are like Colin Farrell's drinking buddies. They actually aren't that bad, acting wise, and they do some crazy crap like killing mob bosses because they're, ya know, evil. SPOILER: They kill these Russians, the lead guy the Fat Man, who is probably the greatest actor you'll ever ever see. PRICELESS PERFORMANCE YURI WHOEVER YOU ARE! Then there's Troy's bearded dipstick Italian friend who the Brothers McDoodle just love. I have no idea why, though. He's supposed to be the ""funny man"", and the guys about as funny as anal cancer. He dies, I can't remember why, I was just happy when it happened. And the bros are like ""We call upon the power of the Blarney Stone!!!"" and they break from their bondage and slay the Italian stallions who have imprisoned them to avenge the dipstick. Oh God, that was funny. But not as funny as Willam Defoe. Nothing will ever be. Willam Defoe as a gay FBI agent who SPOILER: Dresses in drag (thanks for that one Troy) and makes out with an Italian thug to help save the boys when he's totally abandoned the badge to join their homo vigilante romp through out Baaaston. Love it. SPOILER: The definitive scene of the movie features a five minute long gay fantasia ""FIRE FIGHT!!!"" as Defoe would put it where he conducts in retrospect as the Bros and Dipstick shoot Billy Connoly...a lot.Billy Connoly, back from, well Ireland I guess, shows up as ""Il Duce"". LOL!!! Come on, that is fantastic!!! He's a crazy Con Air Assassin who don't know pain, son. Who else but Billy Connoly could bring this brilliant character to life? In the end the movie poses the question, ""What is more important; God's Law or Man's Law?"" Deep, very very deep. All I know is Boston sucks. Ha, just kidding. I'm just happy this movie came out. It like, defines a whole genre of independent movies so trying to be independent. I gotta give these guys credit, the money wasn't there, neither was the talent. But it still came out and people are still talking about it. People love it like their lives depended on it! Or they hate it with such passion, that it makes you uncomfortable to be around them. Like its so trying to be something its not. But its not. Truth is it is a piece of brilliant crap. Served on a platinum tray for your consumption. I don't know why Mr. Weinstein would give this movie his blessing at first. My friend and I think he lost a bet. But thank God it did get made. So please, see this movie and marvel at is grungy, late nineties, ham-bone, ruffing and blaring magic.",The Boondock Saints
816,kcntryfrg,must have,10,10 March 2006,"Excellent movie especially to see around saint patty's day!I think it's an excellent mixture of action, suspense and some dark comedy . If you really pay attention it's actually a story of guys being in the wrong place, and time. In the end truth and justice is served with a community free from evil gangster thugs.The community as a whole, really could careless if the saints are caught cause the only ones that they are actually removing from this earth are bad men who have plagued the surrounding areas the saints live in. The way the movie ends really is confusing but for those of us with an ironic sense of humor it's wonderful! Better luck next time William.",The Boondock Saints
817,zumbamorgan,in movie theaters one night only..,9,12 May 2006,"This is a fun movie with a lot of humour, great Decalogue, solid action scenes and is a little thought provoking - but not too much The acting is great with Dafoe stealing the show but all the main characters are well played including a great cameo from Billy Connoly I watched it by accident on TV but it was ""cut"" for TV so bought the DVD which is great, main reason I'm posting a comment now is because the powers that be have made the overdue decision to play this in movie theaters - by all accounts it didn't play much on its release back in the day so whether or not you've seen it you should make every effort to catch it on the big screen if you can.May 22nd 2006 one night only in theaters in the US.http://www.bigscreenboxoffice.com/subpage/tix_results.asp",The Boondock Saints

They decide to rid the streets of Boston from the less than just. A wonderful deep movie with just enough comedy added. It's violent but the gore is not the center of the movie. The acting in the movie is also phenomenal. Willam Defoe is at him prime here. The dark humor mixed with the serious message of indifference makes for a one of a kind movie experience. I also recommend watching the cut scenes. Just one more thing to love. If you enjoy movies such as ""Way of the Gun"" or ""Fight Club"" then this is most definitely the movie for you. not to mention that this is THE BEST MOVIE EVER!",The Boondock Saints
819,thepillaroflight,Excellent film in every way.,10,21 April 2007,"The story is unique and intriguing, yet one that touches a familiar yearning in everyone. Mixing Catholicism and Irish American culture with elements of a detective story and a call for justice and reform, Boondock Saints speaks to the inherent flaws of our justice system as well as the inherent moral conflict in individuals of justice vs. law, two concepts whose interests aren't always aligned.Character. This film presents a variety of interesting characters, charismatic and intriguing in their own way, from the brothers with a mission from God to the detective with a moral dilemma. The movie does a good job of creating well rounded characters.I love the constant mix of intense chant music. Each scene is played out as a true work of art with the balance of music, atmosphere, story, and humor.Humor - very well done and carried out throughout the film without detracting from the substance of the plot or the message. None of the humor is cheesy, obnoxious, or overly perverse. This film rises above such things.The action is also very well done, making each scene feel unique and interesting, rather than simply mundane explosions and shootings that every film has.",The Boondock Saints
820,kartafla,I give it 16 out of 10!,10,27 March 2006,"I loved that movie. I think it's a little underrated, at least in my country, not everybody knows of this film. It is without a doubt the coolest one I have ever seen. It is so goo that I actually was lost for words after seeing it. Sean Patrick Flanery and Norman Reedus deserve the biggest praise for that outstanding performance. Willem Dafoe is indeed lovely to watch and David Della Rocco is great in his role as the Funny man. I bought it and watch it every other week, if not more often. It's in the same category as Braveheart and The lord of the rings. This is quality stuff! I'm just waiting for a sequel!! and remember; don't cross the road if you can't get out of the kitchen!",The Boondock Saints
821,fieldstonekennels,Ethical Questions,10,29 March 2006,"Considering I do not usually watch violent movies, it was surprising to me how much I enjoyed this movie. Inspite of the serious subject matter, it contained little gems of humor - very well done. As usual, William Dafoe is diabolically talented - I loved him. The manner in which the producers ended the movie was interesting - rolling the credits against a backdrop of people's opinions about vigilantes enticed me and my companions to get into a thought-provoking discussion about the ethical dilemmas the movie suggested. I thought the best scene was the opening mass scene: I uncomfortably felt threatened by these 2 young men; on the other hand, they certainly knew their religious lines well. I need to own this movie.",The Boondock Saints
