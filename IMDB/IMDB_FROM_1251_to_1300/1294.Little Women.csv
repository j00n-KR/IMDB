0,TheLittleSongbird,"Stunning film, and a great adaptation of a wonderful book",9,13 June 2010,"Other than this version, the only other version I have seen of the beautiful book is the 1949 version with June Allyson, Margaret O'Brien and Mary Astor. While that version was very good, I think I marginally prefer this version. It is a little too slow at the beginning, but other than that I had no problems with this version of Little Women.The film looks wonderful, the scenery is lush, the costumes are lovingly rendered and the cinematography is fabulous. Plus I loved The Laurence mansion here, so imposing yet beautiful. The music score is a real jewel, really poignant and soothing, and the screenplay is honest, funny and touching. In terms of adapting, the film does a very good job, all the crucial elements of the beautiful story are there and have the same effect here than they do in the book. The 1949 film may be a little more nostalgic and perhaps more cosy too, but this version is truer to the book.The direction is adroit as well, and I loved the acting. Christian Bale is dashing and handsome as Laurie, and Trini Alvarado is a beautiful Meg. Claire Danes is a touching and compassionate Beth, while Kirsten Dunst is great as young Amy, likewise with Samantha Mathis as her older self. Mary Wickes in one of her last roles before she died, was suitably fussy and formidable as Aunty March, and John Neville gave a very good performance as Mr Laurence. Two performances in particular stood out though. One was Winona Ryder, who is a revelation as Jo, she is tomboyish yet ambitious, headstrong and well-meaning and I felt Ryder was better than Allyson at showing these traits to Jo's character. The other is Susan Sarandon, whose Marmee is less sincere yet more maternal. I also felt Gabriel Byrne was an improvement as Mr Bhaer- Rossano Brazzi was charming yet too Italian for my tastes. Byrne was an initially curious casting choice but he does very well.Overall, I loved this adaptation, and as a film it is pretty much stunning. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Little Women
1,bkoganbing,Another generation and universal appeal,8,7 December 2020,"Stepping nicely into the big shoes of Katharine Hepburn and June Alllyson, Winona Ryder heads a cast for another generation of Little Women as Louisa May
Alcott's novel shows it still has a universal appeal.Winona Ryder is Jo March and while we don't hear as many Christopher Columbuses out of her as we did with Hepburn and Allyson she dos get her ahead
of her times feminist point of view across. The other March sisters are Kirsten
Dunst and Samantha Mathis as Amy March, Trini Alvarado as Meg and claire Danes as Beth. Their mom is Susan Sarandon and Mary Wickes is their tyrannical great aunt.Little Women paints a wonderful picture of Civil War era New England. People
back in those days backed up their talk with action and the father who was anti-slavery has gone to war for that cause. The March women believe just as
fervently in the cause as their husband and father and Susan Sarandon does her best to keep body and soul together. Mary Wickes's aid is appreciated but
she's quite an old tyrant domestically.In the novel the men take distinctly second place. But accolades can be given to
Christian Bale for playing the local hunk next door that all the March girls have an eye for. Also Gabriel Byrne as the foreign tutor who opens up a lot of the
world especially for Ryder.Little Women got Oscar nominations for Costume Design and Musical Scoring
and Winona Ryder got a Best Actress nomination., but she lost to Jessica Lange
for Blue Sky.This version can certainly stand up to Little Women of generations past.",Little Women
2,SnoopyStyle,Great young actors,7,15 December 2013,"The March family has fallen on hard time during the Civil War without the father. The four sisters (Winona Ryder, Kirsten Dunst, Claire Danes, Trini Alvarado, Samantha Mathis as older Amy) struggle to find love and their way in the world.There are some great actors here. I wonder if Claire Danes would make an even better Jo. If this was filmed a few years later, Danes would have been the choice. This was an embarrassment of riches acting wise. When you add the young Christian Bale and the veteran Gabriel Byrne, the talents are all there. All except maybe an overarching first rate directions. Gillian Armstrong has made a life of these intimate movies, but this needs a splash of grandeur. The tone of the story never really changes like the music. It's that sweet melancholy that persist throughout. It needs wisps of excitement to break up the monotony of sadness. But it's still a great watch to see all these fine actors.",Little Women
3,Hitchcoc,Shows a Good Story Can Be Made Even Better,10,7 January 2017,"When I bought my first VCR in the 1980's, the first movie I recorded off TV was the Katherine Hepburn version of of ""Little Women."" I recorded it to see if I could get the machine to work. It did and I found that the movie was excellent (I was stunned that I could fast forward through the commercials). So I have a warm place in my heart (I'm sure I saw the old one some other time as well) for this film. There have been some pretty good remakes before, but I find this contemporary one to be really good. With an all-star cast, an excellent screenplay, and a beautiful setting, this timeless book is brought to life. I know some people find it sentimental and maudlin, but it's a really fine portrayal of a time. Also, the characters are often talked about as goody-two-shoes. This is far from the truth. The girls have their own personalities and frequently clash in harsh and mean ways. The movie is unpredictable and true to the author. It doesn't follow a formula that it could have. See this if you have not.",Little Women
4,Prismark10,Moving a little too slowly,5,9 October 2018,"Little Women has a starry cast and sumptuous production values. It is handsomely mounted if a little dull.Set in Massachusetts, the film follows the lives and loves of the four March sisters during and after the Civil war.Susan Sarandon plays their strong willed mother.Christian Bale shines as neighbour Laurie who has a torch for Jo (Winona Ryder) but she rejects his marriage proposal. In later years he falls for and marries the younger sister Amy.Meanwhile Jo becomes a writer in New York and falls for a German professor Friedrich Bhaer played by Gabriel Byrne who seemed to have arrived in America having spent some time in Dublin judging by the accent.Gillian Armstrong has made a leisurely paced elegant film with a modern, feminist spin. It just lacked vroom.",Little Women
5,classicsoncall,"""We all grow up someday. We might as well know what we want.""",7,13 July 2018,"Winona Ryder seemed to have scored a major coup by having her name appear above the title of the picture during the opening credits. Granted, she already had a pretty good body of work behind her, but there were quite a few significant members of the cast in this picture. It's true that at a certain point, her character Jo March takes center stage in this tale of four sisters growing up during, and following the Civil War era. She did a credible job, though the film and story were greatly enhanced by the gorgeous camera work by cinematographer Geoffrey Simpson. I have no quarrel with the movie per se, but as a male senior citizen, there's not much I was able to relate to regarding the story. Based on the novel by Louisa May Alcott, it's fairly transparent that the author is represented by Ryder's character in this largely autobiographical story. It follows the fortunes of the four March sisters on their way to maturity and adulthood along with the attendant rituals of courtship and marriage that they experience, save for young Beth (Claire Danes) who succumbed to the ravages of scarlet fever. Reading several of the reviews on this board, there seems to be a dichotomy between those who feel the movie followed the novel fairly closely and those who thought it did a terrible job. Not having real Alcott's novel, I'd have to leave that impression to each viewer to decide.",Little Women
6,gavin6942,Wino Ryder Excels,7,4 June 2015,"The March sisters live and grow in post-Civil War America.I cannot say I am a huge fan of ""Little Women"", though this adaptation is excellent. We have some strong characters with strong messages (Transcendentalism and women's suffrage) with some incredible actresses filling the roles: Winona Ryder, Susan Sarandon, Samantha Mathias and Kirsten Dunst, to name a few.We also have Christian Bale in a role prior to his huge explosion of fame. Yes, Bale existed in the early 1990s, and yes he did appear alongside various actresses of the day. He had a life before ""American Psycho"" and the Batman films.",Little Women
7,lee_eisenberg,"little women, big quality",10,17 June 2006,"Louisa May Alcott's classic novel gets brought magnificently to the screen. Everyone in the movie does a great job. There is one scene that might make you cry (you'll know it when you see it). I guess that any 19th century story set in New England is destined to make a great movie. If absolutely nothing else, ""Little Women"" is a very good spot in the filmography of Winona Ryder, Gabriel Byrne, Trini Alvarado, Samantha Mathis, Kirsten Dunst, Claire Danes, Christian Bale, Eric Stoltz, John Neville and Susan Sarandon. Truly something that everyone should see.And to think that I'd never even heard of Susan Sarandon before this movie came out.",Little Women
8,jboothmillard,Little Women,5,19 January 2020,"The original novel by Louisa May Alcott, released as two volumes in 1868 and 1869, is an enduring classic, and has produced a good number of film adaptations. Following 1917 and 1918 silent films, the 1933 (first sound) version, and the 1949 (first colour) version, this is fifth feature film adaptation, a star-studded version I had seen once before in college, directed by Gillian Armstrong (My Brilliant Career, Charlotte Gray). Basically, in nineteenth century Concord, Massachusetts, it sees the struggles and adventures of the four March sisters: Josephine ""Jo"" (Oscar nominated Winona Ryder), Amy (Kirsten Dunst), Margaret ""Meg"" (Trini Alvarado) and Elizabeth ""Beth"" (Claire Danes) growing up during and after the American Civil War. With their father (Matthew Walker) away serving in the Union Army, the girls struggle with major and minor problems under the guidance of their strong-willed mother Abigail, affectionately called Marmee (Susan Sarandon). The Marches live in a state of genteel poverty, and they escape some of their problems performing in plays written by Jo in their attic theatre. Living next door to the family is wealthy Mr. John Laurence (John Neville), whose grandson Theodore, nicknamed ""Laurie"" (Christian Bale), moves in with him and becomes a close friend of the March family, particularly Jo. Mr. Laurence's grumpy nature is softened upon meeting Beth, he learns of her musical talent and offers her the use of his grand piano. Meg falls in love with Laurie's tutor John Brooke (Eric Stoltz). One day, an angry and jealous Amy burns Jo's writings, upsetting Jo. Amy attempts to apologise but to no avail. The next morning Amy chases Jo, ice skating with Laurie. Amy breaks through the ice and almost drowns but is saved Jo and Laurie. That night, Jo expresses guilt over what happened to Amy. When Mr. March is wounded in the war, Jo sells her hair so that Marmee can purchase a train ticket to travel to Washington, D.C. and nurse him back to health. Beth continues Marmee's visits to a struggling immigrant family in order to provide them food and firewood. During this time, she contracts scarlet fever from the family's infant. Meg and Jo, who both previously survived scarlet fever, send Amy away to live in safety with their Aunt March (Sister Act's Mary Wickes). Laurie promises Amy to kiss her before she dies should she become ill herself. Before Beth became ill, Jo had been Aunt March's companion for several years, and hopes to travel with her to Europe. When Beth's condition worsens, Marmee is summoned home and nurses her to recovery just in time for Christmas, but she has become weaker. Mr. Laurence gives his daughter's piano to Beth, Meg accepts John Brooke's proposal and Mr. March surprises his family by returning home from the war. Four years later, Meg and John marry, and Beth's health is deteriorating steadily. Laurie graduates from college, proposes to Jo and asks her to go to London with him, but realising she thinks of him more as a friend, she refuses his offer. Jo later has further disappointment when Aunt March decides to take Amy (Samantha Mathis) with her to Europe instead of Jo. Amy now works as aunt's companion and Aunt March wishes for Amy to further her training as an artist in Europe. Crushed, Jo departs for New York City to pursue her dream of writing and experiencing life. There she meets Friedrich Bhaer (Gabriel Byrne), a German professor who challenges and stimulates her intellectually, introduces her to opera and philosophy, and encourages her to write better stories. In Europe, Amy is reunited with Laurie, she is disappointed to find he has become dissolute and irresponsible. He later leaves Amy a letter asking her to wait for him while he works in London for his grandfather and makes himself worthy of her. Jo is summoned home to care for Beth, who has suffered the lingering effects of the illness that has plagued her. A saddened Jo retreats to the comfort of the attic and begins to write her life story. Upon its completion, she sends it to Professor Bhaer. Meanwhile, Meg gives birth to twin girls. A letter from Amy informs the family that Aunt March is too ill to travel, so Amy must remain with her in Europe. In London, Laurie receives a letter from Jo in which she informs him of Beth's death and mentions Amy unable to come home. Jo is surprised and eventually delight when Laurie and Amy return home together and are married. Aunt March dies and she leaves Jo her house, which she decides to convert into a school. Professor Bhaer arrives with a printed copy of her manuscript, but when he mistakenly believes Jo has married Laurie, he departs to catch a train to the West, where he is to become a teacher. Jo runs after him and explains the misunderstanding. When she begs him not to leave, he proposes marriage and she happily accepts. Also starring Florence Paterson as Hannah and Alan Robertson as Dr. Bangs. Ryder gives a marvellous performance as the confident tomboyish young woman, Dunst is adorable, Danes proves herself an up-and-coming talent, Alvarado and Mathis are fine, and there is great support from Sarandon, Byrne and others. I will agree with the critics that this is perhaps a less memorable adaptation of the story, and perhaps the first part (before Mathis swaps with Dunst) is more enjoyable, but the characters and the talented cast make it watchable, an alright coming-of-age period drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Costume Design, and Best Music, Original Score for Thomas Newman, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Costume Design. It was number 65 on The 100 Greatest Family Films. Worth watching!",Little Women
9,ccthemovieman-1,Watching This Yields 'Rich' Results - A Wonderful Re-Make,10,12 January 2007,"""Rich"" is the word I would best use to describe this movie. It's rich  in cinematography with gorgeous scenery and interiors; rich in  characters with all good-hearted men and women of character; rich in  love for each whether its for family or for suitors and rich in  storytelling.  Yes, it's definitely more of a woman's movie than a man's, and not the  sort of thing I would normally enjoy, but this movie was so well-done  that I cannot say anything negative about it. In the modern-era of  film-making (late '60s to today), it is always a pleasure to see a  totally clean and nice movie.  The cast is excellent. It's nice to see Winona Ryder and Susan Sarandon  play ""wholesome"" roles, something they don't always do, but they do it  well here. Ryder is the star of this story although everyone gets  decent screen time. Ryder's character - the more independent,  feminist-type thinker - will always get preference anyway in a  Hollywood film. My favorite of the ""Little Women"" was ""Beth,"" the most  kind and compassionate one. Claire Danes' innocent face won me over.  The real beauty was the grown-up ""Amy,"" played by Samantha Mathis. Most  of her role, however, is seen as a young girl and played by Kirsten  Dunst, who has gone on to become a pretty famous actress. The other  sister is ""Meg,"" who is a solid, conservative woman and is played by  Trini Alvarado. Her role is the smallest of the four girls.  Sarandon's ""Mrs. Abagail 'Marmee' March,"" holds everyone together as  the mother and head of the household while her husband is off fighting  at War. She looks more like an older sister.  I liked the March daughters' suitors in here, too. First there was  ""Laurie"" or ""Teddy"" as he also was called by the girls. A young  Christian Bale played him. Then there was Gabriel Byrne as ""Friedrich  Bhaer."" It was a bit strange hearing this Irishman play a part that  required a German accent. Eric Stoltz plays Meg's future husband, ""John  Brooke."" He starts off as someone with a very stiff personality but  soon changes into a warm and good husband.  If this film appears slow in the first 20-30 minutes, hang in there  because it gets better and better as it goes along. This is just a  beautiful film with fantastic visuals and memorable story that should  bring a tear or two to your eyes by the end. Great storytelling usually  wins out, and that's the case with this movie.",Little Women
10,Quinoa1984,In three word: a lovely quilt,8,4 December 2019,"I don't know if I have much to say about this movie, save for two things: First, the much younger version of myself never would have gone near this, and looking back I can understand it and seeing it now as a grown I'd-like-to-think-vaguely-mature person I appreciate it a lot more (though it makes me wish I had a little sister growing up as I'm sure she would've watched it and I imagine not leaving the room). And secondly, the most succinct way I can think to describe what Little Women 1994 is... It's like being wrapped up in your genuinely loving and wholesome grandmother's *quilt, made from all natural fibers. It's warm and comforting and yet it tells some real truths about the world, and if you wake up in it it will still be just as comforting (or to put it another way, it's the best possible version of what I picture Hallmark movies are like, with the major boost of a cast that includes people like Winona Ryder and Eric Stoltz - what a fascinating 1994 those two had in movies - and Christian Bale rocking a goatee just when his character Laurie is at his moodiest).It's a swell movie to watch with your loved one(s) on a cold almost-winter's night, just as snug as being in the aforementioned quilt.(*I understand the coincidence or irony or what have you I made that comparison when three of these women went on to be in How to Make an American Quilt the next year)",Little Women
11,bevo-13678,Sisters,10,2 April 2020,A good war movie involving sisters or something. The book is heaps better but I wouldn't know as in haven't read that either.,Little Women
12,Doylenf,Satisfactory version is better than the dated '33 classic...,6,17 September 2006,"WINONA RYDER makes an impressive Jo in Louisa May Alcott's LITTLE WOMEN, tomboyishly charming and persuasive as she matures into a fine young writer. She won a Best Actress nomination, but strangely, her career never took off as strongly as it should have after this success. Except for GIRL INTERRUPTED, she hasn't had a recent string of hits nor has she been as busy at her craft as one would expect.A good Jo is essential for the story to work, and since everyone else is well cast this is no problem. SUSAN SARANDON does a nice job as Marmee and the priceless MARY WICKES (in one of her last roles) is a formidable Aunt March. Christian BALE (who went on to much better roles in the future) makes a completely acceptable Laurie, and the sisters are well played by KIERSTEN DUNST (especially good as the young Amy), CLAIRE DANES, SAMANTHA MATHIS and TRINI ALVARADO.Filmed in Canada, there's a genuinely wintry look to the New England landscapes and a warm glow to the interior scenes that is perfectly in keeping with the story. In fact, all of the technical elements are in fine order.But somehow, it never quite reaches the grandeur of Alcott's beautifully written tale and, for a film based on a classic novel, doesn't linger in the memory as it should when the distance of a few years have passed. It should have been a minor masterpiece, but misses the mark, although it's considerably more worthwhile watching than the sweet George Cukor version with Katharine Hepburn which now seems awfully dated in style and conception. There are some modern sensibilities written into this LITTLE WOMEN (thanks to Susan Sarandon's observations as the mother) and, in general, it plays more believably than the '33 classic.",Little Women
13,grantss,Great telling of Louisa May Alcott's classic story,8,7 January 2016,"Great telling of Louisa May Alcott's classic story.The story of four sisters - Jo, Meg, Beth and Amy - told through Jo's eyes. From the bitter days of the Civil War until years afterwards, we see them growing up, their lives, dreams, loves and losses.A wonderful, moving, bitter-sweet story. There is a great sense of family and belonging.Great performances by an all-star cast (just some of them weren't stars yet): Winona Ryder, Susan Sarandon, Claire Danes (14 years old at the time), Kirsten Dunst (11 years old), Christian Bale, Eric Stoltz and Gabriel Byrne plus Samantha Mathis and Trini Alvarado. Winona Ryder received an Oscar nomination for her performance.I do, however, prefer the 1949 version a bit more. It felt more earthy and more focused. That could be because I saw it first, thus the plot is less predictable, or because it is older, thus has that rougher, less pristine, feel to it, which helps the sentiment.This said, the 1994 version is still a great movie.",Little Women
14,evanston_dad,"Harmless Enough, But Just Not for Me",7,17 March 2009,"Eh, whatever.I've never read the Louisa May Alcott story nor seen any of the previous film versions, so I have nothing to compare this to. It's a fairly enjoyable film, warm-hearted and full of girl power. I can see why mothers enjoy watching this with their daughters. I don't know that it's a story that will ever speak much to me, a 34-year-old male.Winona Ryder plays the spunky Jo, and rode the wave of her brief period of success to a second Oscar nomination in two years. She's fine, but hardly Oscar worthy.

15,Wuchakk,"""Time erodes beauty, but what it cannot diminish is the wonderful workings of your mind""",6,3 December 2018,"Based on Louisa May Alcott's classic 1868 novel, ""Little Women"" details the coming-of-age years of four sisters from 1862-1868, covering most of the Civil War and a few years afterward.I love the rustic New England ambiance, especially the wintery parts, but the story curiously isn't as compelling as the classic 1933 version with Katharine Hepburn, at least as I REMEMBER it being. Thankfully, things perk up in the second half when the forceful Jo (Winona Ryder) goes to New York City and develops a friendship with an amicable, but much older scholar (Gabriel Byrne). The ending is heartwarming.It's interesting seeing all these actors when they were younger: Trini Alvarado as the oldest sister Meg, who's interested in a tutor that works next door (Eric Stoltz); Claire Danes as the sickly Beth; and Kirsten Dunst & Samantha Mathis as Amy, younger and older. Christian Bale plays the neighbor, Laurie, who becomes an honorary brother that loves the March family so much he desperately wants to be part of it. Meanwhile Susan Sarandon is on hand as the mother.The film runs 1 hour, 55 minutes and was shot in British Columbia and Deerfield, Massachusetts. While the movie opened rather weakly at the box office during Christmas, 1994, it went on to become a surprise success.GRADE: C+/B-",Little Women
16,SimonJack,A more modern cast in a classic of Americana,7,29 March 2014,"""Little Women"" is one of those stories that movie makers are drawn to film anew after some time with a cast of modern actors. It probably has been done as many times as any other classic novel. The challenge always seems to be to make as good or better film with better technology for production values; and with a cast that is able to portray the film as believable for the time it takes place. Three TV movies gave the story short shrift, and a fourth was a mini- series with nine episodes of 25 minutes each. But all three of the full length movies for the silver screen in the 20th century are well done. They all have very good production qualities and sets. Each, by itself, is worthy of the novel by Louisa May Alcott. Yet, there are differences. I compared the 1933 and 1949 films in my reviews on them. So, now I match the 1994 version up against the other two films. My review focuses on the story as presented with the cast in the film. How well does this film overall reflect the mannerisms, customs and idiosyncrasies of the time the story takes place – as opposed to the time in which the actors are living? I thought the 1933 and 1949 films were well situated in the time of the novel – the 1860s. But this 1994 film has a modern feel to it. For instance, the pouting and very marked mood and expression changes by Winona Ryder as Jo are how we see people acting, and behaving in real life, at the end of the 20th century. She seems to overact. But people weren't that given to such expressiveness in the mid-19th century. At least not by any means we can tell from novels, studies, family stories and other accounts. In the 1933 film, Katherine Hepburn's Jo seemed forced in her feigning a tomboy by male mannerisms in her play and dialog within the film. But in the 1949 film – without words, we see the tomboy in Jo quite clearly when June Alyson jumps the fence, falls on her face in the snow, and then gets up to go around and jump the fence again – this time without falling. At the same time, Louisa May Alcott wrote her different characters with particular traits. In this 1994 film, we see more of Marmee – here played very well by Susan Sarandon, than in the earlier versions. She seems to be more of a doting mother here. But that is a considerable change from the earlier films. They seem more true to the book and the times. Marmee is gone quite often to care for other needy people – especially Mrs. Hummel and her family. So, the girls are alone more and have somewhat of a responsible nature in being able to do things by themselves in Marmee's absence. The roles of Beth, Laurie, John Brooke, Aunt March and Mr. Laurence especially were all better portrayed by the respective cast members in the 1949 film. So, in general then, this 1994 version of ""Little Women"" is very good, but is not the best. It comes close to the 1933 film with Katherine Hepburn, Joan Bennett, Henry Stephenson, and Douglas Montgomery . But neither this nor the 1933 film can match the 1949 version with June Allyson, Mary Astor, Margaret O'Brien, Janet Leigh, and C. Aubrey Smith. In my review of the 1949 film, I noted all the roles that I found to be better over the 1933 film. Those differences all stand in comparison to this film as well – although for different reasons in some cases.",Little Women
17,ericstevenson,A classic story,9,17 January 2018,"So this is another adaptation of the popular novel ""Little Women"" for Book Month. I admit that the first version I saw (the 1949 one) was good, but it was a little hard to follow. There was a lot going on and the plot wasn't that focused. I think this movie was better because I understood it more. Then again, I had already seen one version so I was already more familiar with the story. The main story is that Jo is trying to have her novel published.It's funny how the novel she's working on herself is actually called ""Little Women"", although I assume it's not the same as the actual story happening. I would think a writer would know what it's like to be a writer. The story is mostly slice of life and focuses on various other smaller aspects of the character's lives. I didn't know this had anything to do with Christmas. I should have seen this back in December! At least I'm seeing it now for Book Month.

The young ladies are all quite lovely and talented in their own ways. Elegant Meg (Trini Alvarado) is the oldest and on the verge of womanhood. She laments the fact that her clothes are not as smart as ones the wealthier families' girls wear but she is sweet and giving. Next in age comes Jo (Winona Ryder), a consummate tomboy with a mad passion and skill in creative writing. She earns a few pennies by offering companionship to a wealthier older relative and pens plays for all of the girls to put on for their family. As for third sister Beth (Claire Danes), she is a shy, good-natured gal with a large talent for music, especially as a pianist. That leaves youngest daughter Amy (Kirsten Dunst/Samantha Mathis), who is a reluctant schoolgirl and aspiring artist. Oftentimes, Jo and Amy mix like oil and water, so Meg is inclined to befriend Amy while Jo and Beth are very close. After the holidays, the girls meet their neighbor, a wealthy young man named Theodore Laurence (Christian Bale) and his tutor, Mr. Brook (Eric Stoltz). Teddy, aka Laurie, and Jo strike up a close friendship, although he is attentive to all of the girls. Among the milestones this tale relates are Meg's first ""coming out"" dance, Amy's troubles at school, Beth's serious illness and Jo's rejection of Teddy/Laurie's well-intentioned romantic advances. Soon, Meg is courted by Mr. Brook, Jo travels to New York to tutor and meet with publishers, and Amy goes abroad to study art. Only Beth remains at home, where sickness comes again to her frail self. Through laughter and tears, the ""little women"" are becoming adults. How will it all end? This beautiful story, written by Louisa May Alcott more than 100 years ago, is a perfect film for families, especially those with daughters. The spunky, resourceful March girls and their loving mother are wonderful role models for females everywhere. The actors of the film are all quite fine, although Ryder, exhibiting nice acting skills, seems a bit too beautiful for Jo. Alvarado, Danes, Sarandon, Stoltz, Gabriel Byrne and especially Dunst are complete joys. As for Bales, he is extremely handsome and, ladies, he smiles, too.....so many of his future roles would be so much darker. The sets, costumes, and camera work are very beautiful, making a gorgeous movie and the direction is solid and worthy of praise, although the pace lags from time to time. In short, there are several versions of this classic on the market but this one can stand up to the rest of them. Why not begin with this very enjoyable film and move on to the Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor and other versions sometime in the near future? You and yours will be very glad you did.",Little Women

The sequences after Beth's death and after she sells her hair are particularly affecting, and there is more about her uneasy relationships with the growing Amy and with Laurie. Susan Sarandon is fine as Marmee, as is Claire Danes as Beth. Gabriel Byrne I'm still not sure about but he's OK to look at so whatever reservations I have about him in the role I'll set aside.This film isn't essential and I'd rank the '30s and '40s versions above it - however it is entertaining, sticks very closely to the book, has a quiet confidence and charm you can buy into if you're in the right mood, and is a fairly decent film.",Little Women
22,Red-125,"The Best ""Little Women"" We've Seen",10,25 November 2016,"Little Women (1994) was directed by Gillian Armstrong. I've reviewed five or six film versions of the novel. Each movie had its strong and weak points. All in all, I think this version was the best. Trini Alvarado portrays Meg. She's the oldest sister, and the most conformist one. Winona Ryder plays Jo, the least conformist, most active sister. (Jo is a proxy for Louisa May Alcott, the author of the novel.) Claire Danes--in the pre-Juliet stage of her career--portrays Beth, the angelic sister. Kirsten Dunst, at age 12, played the youngest sister, Amy, as a pre-teen. (Another actor played Amy as an adolescent.)Susan Sarandon did as well as she could in the complex role of Marmee. Director Armstrong give her some 20th Century feminist dialog, but that's not Sarandon's fault.I think the strongest acting came from Gabriel Byrne as Professor Bhaer. This is another tough role. Byrne is sophisticated, poor, and much older than Jo. (When he played the role, he was 21 years older than Ryder.). However, he carries it off. Most of the other actors portraying Bhaer look too much like Santa Claus. He doesn't.I was surprised by director Armstrong's choice of Ryder for Jo. Jo is supposed to be boisterous and energetic, and Ryder doesn't strike me as having that temperament. However, she carried it off so well that she was nominated for an Oscar.Claire Danes was cast against type. Poor Beth is good, kind, and gentle. Does that sound like Claire Danes, even at age 15?Despite these problems, this movie works very well. The production values are high, the actors are skilled professionals, and Director Armstrong brings the novel to life.We saw Little Women on the small screen, where it worked very well. Seek it out and see it!",Little Women
23,l_rawjalaurence,Heartwarming Version of a Classic,8,11 January 2014,"Viewers expecting a faithful adaptation of Louisa M. Alcott's novel are likely to be disappointed. However Gillian Armstrong's film is a charming piece - beautifully photographed with a strong sense of seasonal change and how the March family react to such changes. The lighting - both natural and artificial - is soft yet atmospheric, the use of music unobtrusive yet significant. Yet Armstrong does not want to produce a heritage film, prompting viewers to admire the historically accurate sets and costumes; on the contrary, her approach remains strongly character-focused, with the attention paid to nuances of performances. Winona Ryder gives perhaps the best performance of her entire career as Jo; her command of gesture and facial expression is impeccable, especially at those moments of extreme disappointment (for example, when she is told that her first book manuscript is actually no good). A young Kirsten Dunst is both childlike yet mature as Amy; someone who wants to act grown-up yet yearns for her father to be around. Susan Sarandon turns in a winning performance as the matriarch of the family; someone who is incredibly fond of her offspring, yet well aware of their individual faults. The ending might be sentimental, but Armstrong is nonetheless well aware of the economic hardships experienced by the March family as they struggle to survive while their father is away fighting. Definitely one of the best classic adaptations to appear during the Nineties.",Little Women

Gillian Armstrong's direction is seamless and invisible in the strongest way, getting the best from her actors, cinematographer, designers, and the story itself, while never making you conscious of all the style and tone she's bringing to it.While it threatens to feel to Hollywood/sappy/ period-stogy for the first few minutes, stay with it., It quickly warms up and comes to vibrant life, turning into a wonderfully winning proto- feminist story, very touching, and full of unexpected moments and twists. One of my very favorite period family films.",Little Women
26,smatysia,Not a single false note from any actor,8,10 April 2000,"A really fine show. Not a single false note from any actor. I enjoyed this much more than the 1933 version by George Cukor. Maybe it's the color photography and more attractive actresses, I don't know. Being a guy, I haven't read the book, and so didn't know that Jo was not supposed to be beautiful. If this is so, then I can see how the casting of Katherine Hepburn for that part was a better choice than Winona Ryder. But I just loved Ryder's performance here, along with the entire cast, particularly Trini Alvarado.  The only criticism I can muster for this film is the emphasis on 1990's style feminism in a film set in the 1860's. Maybe this came from the book, too. I don't know, but I sort of doubt it.",Little Women
27,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,Good movie about sticking together through thick and thin,9,27 July 2006,"LITTLE WOMEN, in my opinion, is a good movie about sticking together through thick and thin. If you ask me, the March women (Winona Ryder, Trini Alvarado, Samantha Mathis, Kirsten Dunst, Claire Danes, Mary Wickes, and Susan Sarandon) did a good job of doing just that. I don't think I could handle living in those days of war and poverty. It's hard for me to explain why. Well, it would probably be because I'm used to today's modern technology and whatnot. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was ideally cast, the direction was flawless, the production design was spectacular, and the performances were top-grade. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this good movie about sticking together through thick and thin.",Little Women

The cast is perfect, the setpieces are amazing and the story is heartwarming. Unfortunately, it feels like a mix of other period piece movies that I've seen and doesn't elevate the genre. It is very good and rewatchable so I can say that I'm now excited to watch Gerwig's version and what she has to offer.",Little Women
29,Boyo-2,"Wow, what do you know? A worthy remake!",8,14 January 2002,"I've seen the original, starring Katherine Hepburn as Jo which was directed by George Cukor in (what seems to be) 1901.  That's an excellent version of this story, a real classic.Maybe the story just needed a 'new coat of paint' to spruce it up a bit because it sure does seem new and worth telling again. 
Winona Ryder has to carry the movie, more or less, and gives a confident performance as the independent Jo.  Susan Sarandon is not around that much but makes a good Marmee.  Christian Bale is great, as always, and Trini Alvarado and Eric Stoltz round out the cast. You don't see Claire Danes that much, but then it becomes about her quite a bit as the story moves on.  A gift she receives for Christmas from a kindly neighbor could give your tearducts a workout, at the very least.
Beautiful movie.  Could even be longer, and how many times can you say that about anything?",Little Women
30,rbverhoef,A very fine movie,7,2 January 2004,"'Little Women' tells the story of the four sisters March and their loved ones. The one we follow constantly is Jo (Winona Ryder). The other three are Meg (Trini Alvarado), Beth (Claire Danes) and Amy who is played by Kirsten Dunst when she is young and by Samantha Morton when she gets older. They live in Concord, Mass. and the story starts during the Civil War.Their father is in that civil war and the sisters live with their mother (Susan Sarandon). They make friends with a guy named Laurie (Christian Bale). Especially Jo is very fond of him. We also learn to know Mr. Brooke (Eric Stoltz) who will become very important in Meg's life. Gabriel Byrne plays Friedrich Bhaer who is the man in Jo's life during her time in New York. Why she ends up there and what happens exactly, also with Amy and Beth, is not for me to reveal.Everything in the movie looks beautiful. The costumes, the production design, everything. The score from Thomas Newman is perfect as well. The performances are pretty good. Winona Ryder, Christian Bale and the little Kirsten Dunst in particular do a very good job. That leaves us with the story. Sometimes it is a little predictable, but so was the book and in that way the movie stays close to it. With some interesting surprises and a second half that shows us some real emotion it still is very enjoyable.",Little Women

I thought the whole movie was superb and perfectly cast and am really glad this remake was done. It was a great night at the movies.Watching this movie made me enraptured with this time period and made me also want to know these people. The story wasn't changed and the movie's warmth and gentleness were still as luminous as ever. No flashiness at all just magnificent storytelling and it was really superb to see. With so many movies oriented toward violence, anger, brutality etc Little Women is a breath of fresh air. I love all types of movies but where would we be without an occasional heartwarming, uplifting(at times) classic like this?Everyone was flawless in this but I must single out Danes, Sarrandon and one of my favorites Ms Winona! (Who else but Winona could have played Jo?).If you haven't seen this yet you certainly should. Little women is another classic that never gets old. This remake is Absolute perfection, a 10 of 10 easily, so kick back, grab some ice cream and watch!",Little Women
32,aimless-46,The Best of the Three,9,6 January 2007,"The most interesting thing about the three film versions of ""Little Women"" is comparing them to each other or comparing each of them to Alcott's book. What makes them so difficult to choose between is that the casting of the four title characters is the critical element, and each film featured at least one actress whose performance was clearly superior to her character's portrayal in the other two films. This all star cast would include Jean Parker (Beth) in the 1933 version, Janet Leigh (Meg) in the 1949 version, and Winona Ryder (Jo) in the 1994 version. The 1994 version also had the best Amy, if only because they wisely split the role into a younger Amy (Kirsten Dunst) and an older Amy (Samantha Mathis). Since Jo is pretty clearly the most important of the four sisters (to the story), the 1994 version gets my nod as the best of the three films. The 1933 version pulls in as a close second as Joan Bennett and Katherine Hepburn are the second best Amy and Jo; and Francis Dee's Meg is as good as Trini Alvarado's. Neither Margaret O'Brien nor Claire Danes come even close to Parker's portrayal of Beth. The biggest casting problem all the productions had was in the age of the actresses. With the exception of Beth, all three characters must span a five year period. The casting process typically addressed this by selecting older actresses and getting them to play (with varying degrees of success) much (June Allyson was 32 years old) younger versions of themselves during the first half of the film. At least the 1994 versions managed to get the birth order right. The 1933 version had some problems in this area, as Hepburn was two years older than Dee and Bennett five years older than Parker. While this still causes many Alcott fans to cringe, it is nothing compared to the 1949 version where Allyson was ten years older than Leigh and Elizabeth Taylor was five years older than O'Brien. Taylor should have played Jo, which would have saved viewers from Allyson's embarrassing portrayal and from Taylor's attempt to pass as a blonde. Few actresses (even in black and white) were less suited to a light hair color. While Taylor's portrayal of Amy is painful, she would have been well suited to the Jo role. Critics frequently point out that both Hepburn and Allyson were much like Jo in real life, so there is a certain irony that Ryder's portrayal of the character (one so dissimilar to herself) was far superior. But Ryder and Jo have a similar level of intensity so maybe it was not as much a stretch as it seems. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",Little Women
33,eric262003,"Sweet Film, But Way Too Sugary",7,29 April 2019,"This marks the fifth adaptation to the classic novel by Louisa May Alcott from 1868 as we watch the March sisters makes the transformation from little girls to mature adults truly has solidified impact to today's audiences even though it was made in 1994. This adaptation under the direction from Gillian Armstrong, succeeds in staying true to the novel and has both similarities and differences from all the other adaptations before and after this one.This is the tale of four empowered sisters who are of diverse personalities is very strong in the department of melodrama, but in the highest of compliments as each of the performances conveys charm and sophistication and makes each scenes feel more carefree and easier to watch. Sure it may not have an original spin like the other adaptations, but with memorable characters I'm sure there'll be much to remember about them.Unless you haven't read the novel or have seen the other adaptation ""Little Women"" focuses on the March clan during the time where the men were off in battle during the Civil Wars in the late 1850's till the mid 1860's. March clan reside in the Orchard House located in Concord, Massachusetts. The head matriarch Marmee (Susan Sarandon) is under the independent care of four daughters while her husband (Matthew Walker) is off fighting in War and is badly wounded in which Marmee tends to him to get back in health. As for the four daughters, they develop a strong bonding that very few people can keep them apart. They are all strong-willed and each have individual personalities. We have the volatile Jo (Winona Ryder), the elaborate minded Meg (Trini Alvarado), the introverted but sweet Beth (Claire Danes) and the mischievous Amy (Kirsten Dunst later by Samantha Mathis). Even though their unity seems like a hard nut to crack, there are men who come into their lives and eventually they end up falling in love with them and marrying the sisters. We have Laurie (Christian Bale in his breakthrough performance) who's a neighbour and friend of the March's who's very cultural in nature who loves the piano and later marries Amy. Then there's John Brooke (Eric Stoltz) who's a lower-class tutor who has a crush on Meg and then there's the wise Professor Bhaer (Gabriel Byrne) who's a German immigrant who eventually marries Jo.The beauty of ""Little Women"" is depended on the cinematography by Geoffrey Simpson and backed by a great score by Thomas Newman. The technical aspects are as immaculate as they come. But it is the acting that carries the weight of the movie. Ryder was the real standout as Jo. She was of-course the character that personifies the novelist Alcott herself. If it wasn't for the disciplined direction from Armstrong, Ryder would've carried the film on her own. Fortunately, all he other sisters have their turns to shine. The only thing that prevents the characters portrayals to near perfection is the shift of character from youngest daughter Amy as a spunky little kid played by Dunst to a more sedate adolescent played by Mathis.Long before rising to superstar status, Christian Bale was struggling to make a new for himself at the time starring in mediocre roles in ""Newsies"" and ""Swing Kids"", he now looked prime for the big time in this role as Laurie. He's really outdid himself here compared to his previous outing he did with Robert Sean Leonard in the streets of Germany during the Nazi invasion.If there was a weakness to ""Little Women"" it would be that the story has little to absolute no flaws within the characters. And what's wrong with that? All the characters appear to be too sweet, kind and lovable to the point it gives you a cavity in your mouth. There is very little scenes where someone says something mean-spirited and that there is little conflicts that's just too hard to believe. It makes everything too saccharine and immaculate it at times feels a bit unnatural. Aside from that it's a great adaptation and the movie itself is handled with great care. It really is period piece that's still a timeless classic that one can enjoy for a light piece of family entertainment.",Little Women
34,fntstcplnt,Little Women (1994),8,21 February 2020,"Directed by Gillian Armstrong. Starring Winona Ryder, Trini Alvarado, Christian Bale, Gabriel Byrne, Susan Sarandon, Kirsten Dunst, Samantha Mathis, Claire Danes, Eric Stoltz, John Neville, Mary Wickes, Florence Paterson. (PG)Pleasant adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's Civil War-era literary evergreen, with sentimentality and melodrama to spare. Tale of the March family household's four daughters of various ages and temperaments coming of age under the devoted care of compassionate mother hen Sarandon will ring familiar even to those who've never read the book (or seen any of several film versions); as Ryder points out multiple times, there are so few opportunities for women at the time that weren't related to marrying well and expanding the flock. But director Armstrong and screenwriter Robin Swicord aren't afraid to inject a little modern feminism into the mix (it certainly makes the rigid, if occasionally swooning, societal politeness easier to tolerate). A lot of talent in the (mostly) young cast, some already established and others up-and-coming, with Ryder, Sarandon and precocious Dunst the stand-outs. Carefully constructed and filmed with a light touch and warm glow; wise revisions can't fully compensate for the creaky nature of the source material's plotting, but close enough.77/100",Little Women
35,bandw,It grew on me,7,1 February 2009,"Never having read the novel nor seen any of the previous movies of ""Little Women,"" I decided to give this a shot. The beginning, which has Abigail March raising four young daughters while her husband is off fighting in the Civil Was, is a bit treacly. The family is so wholesome with such little real conflict that Alcott must have been far enough removed from her childhood that she could present the autobiographic material with such sunny nostalgia.After the personalities of the four girls had been established and they started going their separate ways I became more interested. The period settings (Concord, Massachusetts) and dress seem authentic and were large contributors to my enjoyment. The lighting and musical score lend a certain coziness and in general the filming and acting is of high quality and indicate a dedication to the effort by all concerned.All of this is not to say that I did not have some serious problems. Beyond the fact that the family on rare occasion gets mail from Mr. March recounting his status, we have no other indication that the United States is engaged in the most costly and gruesome war in its history. The Marchs complain that they are poor, but any serious privations are not apparent. They live in a beautiful, spacious house that seems to be well heated during the cold winters and they attend lavish dances. They live next door to a wealthy man whose grandson Laurie becomes a suitor to Jo, the independent daughter who wants to become a writer. All events lead to Jo and Laurie becoming an item, but when Laurie proposes, Jo refuses. She gives the excuse that they would always be fighting, even though their relationship has never been presented as anything but harmonious. After the ""four years later"" break Amy has changed into a distinctly different woman, both physically and personally--from a playful and extroverted child to a somewhat remote painter. I felt this was a major disconnect.But, in spite of my misgivings I found it hard not to be won over by this heartwarming, sentimental story and the excellent production values.",Little Women

Beth, Claire Danes, the musician dies. Meg marries Lorry's tutor and has twins. Gabriel Byrne marries Jo.Susan Sarandon plays marmee. This is an excellent production that is not overly sentimental.",Little Women
37,jpschapira,Fantastic,9,21 December 2005,"Mrs. March (Susan Sarandon) sits down on the floor during Christmas to read a letter and to light candles with her four children. Then they sit around the piano and play Christmas' songs. Outside is snowing as a beautiful music plays (Thomas Newman). And there's a lot of snow in ""Little Women"", but it is not a film about Christmas or snowy weathers; it is about five women and how each of them face that exhilarating journey called life.The letter mentioned above comes from the girls' father, who is in War. At that time, daughters weren't used to say ""dad""; ""father"", they called him. They gathered in a big room and shared their illusions: ""It's not the same without the presents"", Meg (Trini Alvarado) explained. ""I'm desperate for drawing pencils"", the little Amy (Kirsten Dust) said. ""I wish I didn't have to work for great aunt March"", Jo (Winona Ryder) complained.Beth (Claire Danes), talented, quiet and always uninspiring, is asked: ""What is your wish for Christmas?"". ""I would like the War to end so father could come home"", she replies; and all of the daughters want that too. ""They do have a nice piano"", Beth adds, looking over the window where Laurie (Christian Bale) is playing. Laurie (""the captive"" according to the girls) will be a dear friend of the family and the girls.They will all play together in a secret society that writes articles and carries on plays; they will all listen to Jo's stories waiting for the newest chapter, they will all have a constant smile on their faces, because they are nice persons. The girls, for example, know that they're not classy, but it doesn't bother them. However, they need to be presented in society, and find a man that wants them.A friend of Mrs. March comes one day and they're talking about the girls: ""Meg needs to find a good man, she could; she has to attend to the events"". Instantly, Jo runs down the stairs enthusiastically and tells something to her mom. Her friend interrupts: ""And this one is getting wasted with so much reading"". In fact, Jo is very intelligent and wise, destined for big things; and knows it and is proud of it.One day she and Meg go to an event and Jo tries to hide from classy boys and finds Laurie. They laugh, they dance, and years later when Laurie goes to college, Jo tells him: ""I wish you didn't have to go"". They look at each other and you could swear they are in love, but they haven't even kissed. Again, years later, he asks her to marry him, and she rejects him generating misunderstanding in the family. Life doesn't always go as it is supposed to.So Jo seeks for independence, going to New York, where she meets Friedrich (Gabriel Byrne), an old, humble German teacher. They both share the same interests, and he wishes to protect her. He advises her grandly about her story writing: ""Write from life; from the deepness of your soul"". When they first kiss, you can tell that Jo wants it, and you instantly feel bad for Laurie, because you think he is Jo's fate; but many of the girls' fate is betrayed and things don't always turn out right at the end of the road.Tragedies and moments of great happiness follow in the life of the Marches; uncertainties and twists. Mrs. March tries to be the core she always was and keep the family together, and it is Susan Sarandon's task fulfilled in this great portrayal of hers. With very little words spoken and a bunch of understanding looks, we know her character is a woman we should admire and look up to.Personally, I would also admire all of the girls, that fought for the life they wanted; restlessly. Trini Alvarado's Meg is determinedly confident in her decisions and not a quitter at all. Now look at 12-year-old Kirsten Dunst's Amy and 15-year-old Claire Danes' Beth, two performances that clearly show the gifted actresses they are now and what they will be. Same to be said of Christian Bale's Laurie.But it is, without question, Jo's life that was a little more detailed in Luisa May Alcott's novel. However, screenwriter Robin Swicord adapted the story so it could look general and Gillian Armstrong directed it with no focus on any specified character in this wonderful, marvelous movie.Nevertheless, it was Winona Ryder's name the only one before the film's title in the credits, and it was her performance the one that shocked everyone the most. The beautiful 23-year-old (she's still beautiful now) takes the responsibility of an adult and delivers an Oscar-caliber portrayal that will stay in my head for the rest of my life. Brilliant acting for an actress that still deserves an award she never got.The Marches' life is not the happiest of all.

40,dy158,Probably the ultimate American classic,8,1 April 2011,"It has been years since I first read Louis May Alcott's celebrated novel Little Women. It would come to represent what it is good about America, or at least for me. Gillian Armstrong's adaptation of Alcott's novel of the same name is the next best thing, considering I was not born when the previous three adaptations came about.The film adaptation surrounds the story over the four March sisters during and after the American Civil War: Meg (Trini Alvarado), Jo (Winona Ryder), Beth (Claire Danes) and Amy (Kirsten Dunst, with Samantha Mathis playing the older version). Then there is of course their mother affectionately known as Marmee (Susan Sarandon) to the March sisters, taking care of the family while the father is out on the front.Like any family, they have their ups and downs with the squabbles (like between Jo and Amy, where it would be after a skating accident which befell on Amy drew the sisters closer), but never dismiss it as yet another film to be considered forgettable because the beauty of this enduring American classic is despite the various differences in the March household between the sisters, what binds them together is their sense of togetherness (it showed when Beth came down with scarlet fever and how everyone came round together, right till Beth's last days). Then there is of course their wealthy but kind-hearted neighbours in the Laurences in especially the high-spirited grandson of Mr. James Laurence (John Neville) in Theodore 'Laurie' Laurence (Christian Bale).As the March sisters grew older, with the exception of piano-loving Beth who would die from scarlet fever after first taking care of the Hummels children, the sisters would come to discover what lies ahead for each of their separate lives. Meg got married first, Amy accompanied her relatives to Europe where it opened her horizons, Jo moved to New York City to pursue her writing ambitions after turning down Laurie's marriage proposal. It would be while working as a governess to Mrs. Kirke's (a friend of Marmee) daughters to finance her writing ambitions when Jo eventually found her happiness in the form of the German professor who also lives in Mrs. Kirke's boarding house in Professor Friedrich Baher (with Gabriel Bryne in his excellent German accent, despite he is actually Irish).There are not many films which can always warm the heart for even the most cynical of us all, but even for those who has not read Louisa May Alcott's novel, will be heartened at the fact that the film adaptation stay true to the spirit of the celebrated novel.",Little Women
41,macpherr,This movie is a beauty.,10,6 January 2000,"Based on the novel by  Louisa May Alcott,"" Little Women"" is of  my favorite stories and movies. I especially love this rendition with actresses and actors of our days. I identify with the characters and see my three sisters and myself in the March sisters. I am the second of three sisters as ""Jo March"", Winona Rider (How to Make an American Quilt ) is in the movie because I write, I am very outspoken,  and thrive much for perfection,  this is definitely a movie for me. I love the beautiful scenery, the love between the four sisters as children and as adults, and find little ""Amy"" Kirsten Dunst (Wag the Dog) very amusing as I always found my baby-sister very wise and fun. I love Susan Surandon (Dead Men Walking) as ""Marmee March""  because she teaches their daughters to be honest and decent people, not because they are women but because they are human beings.  This movie is an absolute ten. This is a type of  story that will always be loved because people can identify with it. I also like Denise Di Novi's (The Nightmare Before Christmas) productions and that is one off her best productions. My favorite scenes: When ""Laurie"" Christian Bale (A Midsummer Night's Dream, Empire of the Sun) is accepted as a member of the girls acting club, ""where they reveal their most appalling secrets and bear their souls.""  Laurie promising to kiss Amy in case she is about to die without been kissed. ""Beth March"" Claire Danes (""My So-Called Life"", To Gillian on Her 37th Birthday) saying that she will be homesick for Jo even in heaven. This a very sweet moment!  ""Meg March"" Trini Alvarado (Paulie) wedding  ""John Brooke""  Eric Stoltz (Jerry Maguire). When "" Friedrich Bhaer"" Gabriel Byrne (The Usual Suspects) tells Jo that his hand are empty and she says that his hands are not empty anymore, by holding his hands. Favorite Quotes: Jo: "" I find it poor logic to say that because women are good they should vote. Men vote because they are male and woman shouldn't vote not because they are angels and man are animals but because we are human beings,  and citizens of this country."" Mayor: ""You should have been a lawyer Ms. March!"" Jo:"" I should have been a great many things Mr. Mayor.""",Little Women

This time around the film stars winsome Winona Ryder as Jo March, the pivotal heroine of Louisa Alcott's novel. The role was originally played by Katharine Hepburn in 1933, then June Allyson in 1949. Ryder's take is far less demonstrative and opinionated than either of the previous interpretations, but engaging nonetheless. The cast also includes Trini Alvarado (Meg), Kristen Dunst/Samantha Mathis (both playing Amy  the first as an unscrupulous child, the latter as a matured young woman), Claire Danes (as the ill-fated, Beth), Gabriel Byrne (Prof. Baher  to whom Jo eventually gives her heart), Christian Bale (Theodore Laurence, who originally falls for Jo, but settles on Amy), Eric Stoltz (as tutor John Brooks, who eventually marries Meg) and Susan Sarandon as Marmie.Despite my own affinity for the classics, I must admit that out of all the screen incarnations of this perennial favorite, this contemporary rendition most closely mirrors Alcott's plotting and character development. Director, Armstrong weaves all of the character's stories into one cohesive narrative that develops almost all the plot entanglements on an even footing  unlike the 2 previous versions which were much more centered upon the exploits of Jo and her maturation into a woman of substance. Not that Armstrong lets us forget that Jo is of central importance to this version of the story. It's just that there's so much more to sink your thoughts into here. One is allowed the good fortune to revel in the understanding that develops between Meg and John, for example; or to explore the intimacy that develops between Lawrence and Amy, and the bittersweet epiphany that permits Jo to step out of her cloistered family existence and persevere at a life of divine independence for herself.Columbia's Special Edition DVD is a reprint of the movie only version  this time loaded with extras. In brief, the transfer of Little Woman is near reference quality. Colors are deep, nicely balanced and richly saturated. Blacks are solid and smooth. Whites are clean. Flesh tones are always accurately rendered. Fine details are evident throughout, for an image that is at once sharp and crisp without becoming digitally harsh. The audio is 5.1 and engaging throughout. Extras include an isolated, music only track, director's commentary, several featurettes and a time line for historical novel and film developments. This is an outstanding DVD to own and one that will quite easily become a perennial Christmas favorite. It comes highly recommended.",Little Women
45,jasminn_tan,I Didn't Want It To End!,9,14 December 2019,"I fell in love with the March sisters because even though they were such strong and interesting individuals, they still loved each other so much and they had an incredible bond with each other. For the period that they were in, they had very modern ideas and values. These women were stubborn and could stand up for themselves against the prejudices against women at the time and I think that this is an empowering movie not only for girls and women but also for boys and men.It was so refreshing to watch Jo March (Winona Ryder) chase after her dreams with such vigour, and for her family and friends to support her in her endeavour too. The sisters also had a lovely friendship with Laurie (Christian Bale) who was always there in their time of need. Laurie didn't judge or mock them and instead accepted them as they were with respect and it's something a lot of people don't even do nowadays. I really liked this movie and I'm excited to watch the new adaptation starring Saoirse Ronan, Emma Watson, Meryl Streep, etc.",Little Women
46,native_girl333,"""Your heart understood mine""",10,25 December 2007,"Louisa May Alcott wrote the story of the four sisters of March family in 19th century. Next year will become 200 years since the death of the beloved author. Still today her amazing story of the Family March is luminous and very interesting. Gillian Armstrong directed ""Little Women"" again in 1994 with talented cast including stars like Susan Sarandon, Winona Ryder and Kirsten Dunst.The story begins when March girls are getting ready to celebrate Christmas without their father who is at the battle in Potomac. The family is having a rough time financially because of the war. Nevertheless the March girls are strong but different. Jo (Winona Ryder) wants to become a writer and is very strong-headed, Meg (Trini Alvarado) is the oldest and wants to find a husband, Beth (Claire Danes) who is plays piano and likes to stay at home and Amy (Kirsten Dunst) who likes to draw and fantasies of having a rich man someday. The girls meet Theodore ""Laurie"" Laurence (Christian Bale) who is a grandchild of wealthy Mr.Laurence who are living on the next door. The story is multi-layered and touching. Armstrong has found the essence of Alcott's novel. The talented cast is a cherry on the top of a successful film. There is love, drama and difficult relationships - working combination, indeed. You will laugh and cry and co-live the story of ""Little Women"".Winona Ryder was on the edge of her career and her Oscar-nomination was very well earned. Other cast supports brilliantly.One fact is so odd I have to mention it. Isn't it peculiar that Louisa May Alcott died at 6th of March and in the March family there were six family members... Perhaps just good timing but I'd like to think it is magic.",Little Women

48,dalton2,Very touching drama,8,15 October 2000,"A wonderful movie that gets to your heart. All the actors -specially Winona Rider- are almost perfect. The story is not new, obviously, but this version has a special freshness which makes it a valuable object of cinematographic art.

I highly recommend this film and the book written by Louisa May Alcott.  They are timeless classics.",Little Women
50,daviddaphneredding,heart-warming and drawing,10,21 November 2012,"This movie, which I watch every Christmas, is a wonderful movie in so many ways and for so many reasons. The aesthetic qualities are very appealing: the snow in Civil War-time Concord, Massachusetts was very beautiful, as is the grass in the spring time. As for the acting, the cast was superb. Susan Sarandon, who could act well the part of a rough southern girl, adapted herself well to this part of a proper New England lady who meets well the challenge of raising her four daughters (the ""little women""). While you hated Christian Bale in ""Shaft"", he made a very positive impression in this movie as Teddy. Mary Wickes was convincingly crabby as Aunt March, and you felt for Claire Danes as the fragile Beth. Winona Ryder was excellent as the beautiful and high-spirited Jo. The story was a portmanteau: there were three different love affairs which were resolved at the end of the movie. The final scene was very touching. All in all, it was a superb production which was magnetic: again, I'm drawn to it every Christmas, though it is good entertainment for any time of the year. Definitely a favorite of mine.",Little Women
51,joncha,Is it Jo's or Luisa May's story?,8,18 October 2018,"This was by far the best movie or TV version of ""Little Women"" I have seen. (The BBC production, available on videotape, is also interesting, mainly in that the actress who played Jo was really plain looking, resembling Louisa May Alcott more than any other actress in the other productions.) However, my main complaint with the Gillian Armstrong production was that it couldn't decide if it wanted to tell Jo's story or Louisa May Alcott's story. The latter part of the film, where Jo writes the book ""Little Women"" and talks with Prof. Baer about ""transcendentalism"" is Louisa May's story, not Jo's. And the life of Louisa May Alcott is a wonderful story in itself, worthy of an original movie, about life with her quirky father and their residence in the experimental community Fruitlands, relationships with her literary neighbors in Concord, service as a nurse in the Civil War, and her writing career--which involved much more than children's books.

52,annmason1,Little Interest,3,12 June 2007,"Well, I confess I did not read the book. And, as a person who retched at every one of Margaret O'Brian's performances, avoided that movie. Sooo, I watched the 1994 version basically ignorant of who and what should have been.The colors and historic feel of the film are wonderful. I am still pondering, however, the fact that Amy had quite a growth spurt and the rest of the family stayed physically the same. Wynona Rider never changed physically or emotionally.And let's be honest, Claire Daines stunk (stank?). She was a Concord Madonna if there ever was one, born to be martyred. Boring! What an insipid nonentity! And here's a question; why didn't the father TALK? He was just furniture who hung around. How that man could have produced children is a miracle.Oh well, I've seen worse movies. This one reminds me of Coke that has been shaken in the can and lost its fizzle. Flat. Colorful, but flat.",Little Women

54,baker-9,Excellent Adaptation of Alcott's Book,9,17 January 2001,"Many film enthusiasts will always prefer the 1933 George Cukor version with Katharine Hepburn, but this version is - I think - better scripted and acted overall. It is also the least conventionally sentimental. The Hepburn film is wonderful in it's way, but is sometimes undone by the more primitive film (and acting) techniques at the time. The other candy-cane MGM color version from 1949 is pretty mediocre, and downright dreadful when it gets serious.Back to this film.  Some may quibble with Winona Ryder's version of Jo (she's not Hepburn's equal, to be sure, but who is?), but I still found her believable and affecting.  Susan Sarandon's somewhat feminist Marmee is out of context with Alcott, but done with enough subtlety and grace to make sense dramatically (or perhaps it's just the effect of contemporary sensibilities).Christian Bale is the best Laurie ever, and frankly entire cast is wonderful with one exception: Samamtha Mathis as the grown-up Amy is quite flat compared to the excellent Kirsten Dunst playing the younger Amy.  However, my favorite is Clare Danes as Beth.  This is a role that tends to get lost as Beth is not the most vibrant character.  But Danes plays her with such honest conviction that you pay more attention.  And her death scene with Ryder is truly heartbreaking - it gets me every time. Danes leaves Jean Parker (1933 version) and Margaret O'Brien (1949 version) in the dust.Kudos to director Gillian Anderson, who made a terrific film ""My Brilliant Career"" - with a similar plot line about a rambunctious young woman who gives up a suitor to become a serious writer.  Judy Davis played the lead there, and I must say that she would have made a superb Jo had Armstrong made this film at that time. Ah well....Special mention to the cinematographer and the score by Thomas Newman.  The music does get a bit sentimental at times, but it is gorgeous just the same.",Little Women
55,Lee-107,A Delightful Indulgence in Alcott!,10,1 May 2002,"This is a delightful adaptation of two of Louisa May Alcott's novels -'Little Women' and 'Good Wives'. When I first saw the film, I wasn't too thrilled about the fact that they had compressed both the novels into one movie. But I've seen the film several times now and I must say, it's an excellent effort by Gillian Armstrong! The 2 things I liked most about the movie were the sets and the music. About the former, I think they did a remarkable job at bringing mid-19th century Concord to life! Having studied American literature of that century and especially Transcendentalism(the Alcotts were Transcendentalists), a theory that sprang in Concord, it was nice to see this film and relate that to it. Not that the sets are an exact recreation of the Concord that was, but I guess they come close. Even the March house and it's surroundings are lovingly created, I almost got the feeling that I was in the March house. About the music - it's again a masterly rendition from one of Hollywood's most gifted music directors - Thomas Newman. From 'Corrina Corrina' to 'American Beauty', Newman's music is distinctive and atmospheric. If you've been watching films with his music, you can almost trace his musical genealogy! In 'Little Women', the now familiar strains are there and there's also a nostalgic aural theme of the film that's just another one of Newman's wonders!The cast is rather impressive. Best suited for her part is Trini Alvarado as Meg. She has the quintessential look of Alcott's Meg! And she's rendered her part really well. Kirsten Dunst is a surprise as Amy. She's done an impressive job in bringing out the comic elements of Amy's character! Christian Bale is always a treat to watch. He's one of the most versatile actors today, having played such diverse characters as that of Jesus Christ and the psycho in 'American Psycho'! He's quite endearing as Laurie, if not perfect. I don't think anyone can really be ""perfect"" as Laurie. Laurie is one of those eternal literary characters who's best left face-less, because he's unique to the imagination of every person who reads Alcott's novels... Winona Ryder also does a good job. She and Bale share a good on-screen chemistry. One dialogue that I really adore in this film is when they talk to each other for the first time at a ball. Ryder/Jo says, ""If I weren't going to be a writer I'd go to New York and pursue the stage. Are you shocked? Bale/Laurie says, ""Very."" Bale's indulgent ""Very"" is just perfect! Both their expressions during this exchange are aptly humorous!I think Eric Stoltz and Gabriel Byrne were slightly miscast, especially the latter. Stoltz didn't really have much of a role. But as far as Gabriel Byrne went...well, Mr Bhaer is not supposed to be as handsome as Byrne is!! He's not supposed to be handsome at all! In the novels he's much older, almost like Jo's father. Byrne is great actor, but he's rather young...and as I said, dashing for the role! Susan Sarandon - otherwise not a period-film actress is a treat to watch. She renders her role with a depth and an amazing screen presence. She breathes fresh life in the character of Marmee! Altogether, this film is a treat, an indulgence in the unforgettable world of Alcott!",Little Women
56,GailTaplin-98447,Very enjoyable..,8,22 May 2020,"This film is made by Winona Ryder, Susan Sarandon and Christian Bale.
All the cast play valuable roles and the acting is sincere.

57,mpofarrell,An Earnest And Worthy Remake,8,23 June 2002,"This 1994 adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's evergreen classic novel is a valiant and very workman-like effort that tries very hard to match the quality of the great 1933 production. Obviously technical aspects of this most recent version leave the old war horse in the dust, especially in the sound and editing departments. Although the new film doesn't obliterate memories of the wonderful art direction and costume design of the early ""talkie"" , it does a remarkable job of recreating the look of post Civil War New England, with meticulous attention to detail. As with the 1949 effort, this one is in color, and as photographed by Geoffrey Simpson it is by far the most ravishing ""Little Women"" to look at. Imagine a hand-tinted Christmas card circa mid 1800s and you'll have some idea of the visual beauty this film offers the viewer. As the story of ""Marmee"" March ( Susan Sarandon ) and her four spirited daughters unfolds, the screen is brilliantly awash with each successive season, winter and spring being most memorable. The Currier and Ives facade of the old sound film is magnified tenfold here. A note on the acting : Katherine Hepburn's Jo March dominated the '33 movie to such an extent that she nearly overwhelmed some excellent supporting performances; a lot of this was due to her unusual mien [ lovely but far from the ""standard look"" of the era ] and Bryn Mawr educated diction. The new picture boasts two outstanding portrayals : Winona Ryder's Jo is a luminous creation, less tomboyish and more introspective than Hepburn's characterization. Jo's thunder is nearly stolen by Claire Dane's brilliant interpretation of the kind hearted, sickly Beth. My one gripe is the tad too cute acting of the angelic looking Kirsten Dunst as the younger Amy ; It's a respectable performance but it suffers at times from a tendency to ape the precious mannerisms of the 40's child actress Margaret O'Brien [ who ironically played the older Beth in the '49 release! ]. Australian director Gillian Armstrong has gained a solid reputation for eliciting strong female performances in her collective work, much like George Cukor [1933's director] achieved with his films. Is this new LITTLE WOMEN one for the ages? I think the Hepburn version still reigns, but the new film is an earnest and worthy effort ; it should endure.",Little Women
58,IridescentTranquility,Something that should be treasured,9,8 October 2005,"There are many, many reasons why I love this version of Little Women. The main one - or at least the most immediate - is the way the film looks. I love the soft lighting, the hair and costumes (I was astounded this year when I bought the DVD to hear on the commentary that Winona Ryder's hair was not her own but a wig! I never would have guessed it at all.) The male characters as much as the females, I do love the period costumes, and I'm impressed by the efforts the wardrobe department made to get everything so accurate. The girls were in impoverished circumstances, so the clothes they wear aren't new and look just as though they've been handed down from one sister to another. There are a few subtle touches in this film that I sometimes find a bit jarring, such as when Marmee is talking with John Brooke in front of Meg and mentions her disagreement with the idea of women wearing restrictive corsets, but that is really the only bit that I don't feel is quite right, and it is there to demonstrate Marmee's liberal attitude. I love the way the characters interact, although there perhaps isn't enough demonstration of why Laurie and old Mr. Laurence disagree. Jo and Amy act just like real sisters - they fight and provoke each other into arguments and disputes, and generally have a chance to make little digs at the other. Meg is the pretty - but yet also virtuous - one, and clearly the most socially at ease with the upper classes of the time, for instance reminding Jo ""Don't shake hands with people. It isn't the thing any more"", and in the end - although she has to wait for a period of time that would seem endless today before marrying the man she loves - she opts for a poorer but obviously happier life. It would be very easy to simply say that Beth is not given anything dramatic or interesting to do, but that is the whole point of her character. She watches those around her do great and exciting things, and there is a sense that she herself is happy with that. Susan Sarandon's Marmee clearly holds this family together - the ideal mother figure, she is comforting, incredibly wise (I wonder if anyone has ever met anyone with all the wisdom she seems to have) and always on hand to encourage her girls in their quest to do as they please. The male characters are also interesting. John Brooke is stable and compassionate and sensible. Laurie (also known as Teddy just occasionally) can be quite an intense figure and I was amazed to find that Christian Bale was only about twenty when this film was released. It is as interesting to see the changes his personality goes through as it is to see those the girls go through. The Professor is a slightly unorthodox character and yet he complements Jo perfectly.I have watched this film many, many times now (so many, in fact, that I have sometimes been known to say the lines along with the characters as they say them) and I know I will watch it many more times in the future. It might perhaps be a bit of a holiday film but it's certainly worth watching for the feel-good factor it generates.",Little Women
59,CitizenCairParavel,Best rendition of LW ever.,10,26 December 2020,"Hated the 2019 version. I would have probably liked it if I hadn't seen this one. Winona Ryder is the quintessential Jo IMHO. Susan Sarandon, although not my favorite actress, was the perfect Marmee. I love the look of it, the screen play, the music (lush, gorgeous and appropriate). I hate that WR screwed up her life after this. To me she was a wonderful actress. Wish she had stayed with Godfather 3 instead of letting Johnny Depp ruin her career.",Little Women
60,adamsandel,My favorite version,8,24 December 2020,"Along with the 2017 miniseries, this is the best film version of this classic tale.Ryder totally owns the screen, and the character of Jo, and Bale brightens every scene he's in with warmth and truth.",Little Women

And that's what happened here with Little Women. I was a young girl myself when it came out in theaters and I enjoyed it then, though honestly I don't recall if I had ever read the book before then. I don't have any sisters so I don't know the true relationship between sisters but I imagine it's a lot like brothers and I have three of them so I could relate in many ways to the relationships between the four of them. I think that Jo and Laurie would have made a great couple, but Jo was right. Laurie needed someone more like Amy than herself. Jo and Laurie were too much alike. The combination of Laurie and Amy matched together similar to Jo and Fredrick.Amy was calm and Laurie outgoing and Fredrick was calm and Jo outgoing. I can't think of anyone I know who has seen this movie and not cried when Beth passes away. A scene that sticks in your mind even days after watching it. Cuddle up in a blanket with your popcorn and enjoy this wonderful film.",Little Women
62,annlevtex,My Favorite Film Version,8,3 April 2019,"I first read this book when I was about ten years old, then again every couple of years until I hit twenty. I have since read it once again, and have seen every version except the recent BBC one. This is my favorite film remake of Little Women. Every version suffers, to some degree, from the film/television conventions of its time. June Allyson as Jo is too cute, albeit tomboyishly so. Katherine Hepburn, though wonderful, too crisp and aristocratic. Wynona Ryder some might say is too girlish and vulnerable, but I like that about her performance. Because Jo, for all of her independence, is still a girl in many ways. Jo is a tomboy, a writer, and a budding young woman, all at once. She blossoms throughout the film, and loses some of her prickliness without losing her spirit and color.Susan Sarandon does make a wonderful Marmee. She comes across as a woman and not just a mother figure, though she does well as the latter too. Young Kirsten Dunst is the perfect Amy. I do think the Beth character was given short shrift to some degree, despite a wonderful performance from a young Clare Danes. But to be fair, Beth in the book is given short shrift too, in many ways. It is a long book, that covers a long span of time and has multiple main characters. The focus has always shifted to Jo and then Amy and Meg, in that order. It seems fitting for a movie that has to parse its moments.The romance between Meg and Jon Booke is not given much room to breath. But to be fair, it is not in the book either. And I don't mind that. It was never a central character arc in any way. Jon was kind of a cipher in the book, and probably intentionally. Really, the key relationships are among the sisters, and then with Laurie and the various sisters. This version does a good job with that balance. I never was asked or made to care much about Meg and Jon in the books, beyond wishing them well. Same here, and that is fine.Finally, my biggest point. Jo, Laurie, and Friedrich. I think this version does by far the best job of selling that drama. Christian Bale is just a great actor, and he captures Laurie very well: charming, confident, sensitive, but also a bit callow and never intended to develop past a certain point intellectually. He's a rich boy who needs a beautiful glamorous wife, and that's Amy. I never bought it with the others the way I buy it here. Gabriel Byrne as Friedrich is ideal. He captures the character's awkwardness and profound lack of glamour while at the same time being compelling, attractive, even sexy. You see that Jo accepts him not as a sort of ""male placeholder"" but because she wants him. The final scene is beautiful.The cinematography and settings here are so much better. In other versions the surroundings seem staid, like in a BBC English period drama from the 1970s. Nature is present here, as it was in Civil War Era America. That sort of thing definitely makes a difference.Anyway, a book is a book, and a movie a movie. This won't replace the book, but as a film version, I love it.",Little Women

However, if you have read the book, do yourself a favor and do not see this film. You will be greatly disappointed.This is one of those movies where the book was far better than the movie. Quite disappointing. The movie moved very slow and did not hold or grab me as a watcher. They really downplayed the richness and colorfulness of the characters and it was not dramatic, funny or that entertaining. It totally missed the mark, and it shouldn't have.Filmmakers have been able to capture the spirit of Jane Austen's novels in a wonderful way, however, this can not be compared to that.

The acting is fantastic, everyone brings their A-game, especially Winona Ryder as Jo March, and Christian Bale as Laurie. Their moments on screen are some of the best in the film. You really feel as if you're there in that time period with the March family, outside of the time they sing ""Deck the Halls,"" which wasn't written until about 40 years later. Honestly, the only problems I have with the film are:-They make a big deal out of Beth getting the piano from Mr. Laurie, but, they did a poor job setting it up. The only reason we know she plays piano is because the previous Christmas she played piano for about 20 seconds. But, how did Mr. Laurie know she played piano, and does she even really love playing the piano? The movie did a poor job setting all this up.-The final problem I have is how much everything dragged while Jo was in New York.

69,mercybell,a triumph,10,4 April 2003,"I hear it's really hard to turn a book into a movie, and even as a viewer, I notice this. You can keep the book and lose a movie, or you make a movie and lose a book.  But this balances and keeps the essence of the book and creates a miraculous movie that works on every single level.It's depth, it's warmth, it's beauty (from aesthetics to costumes to storyline), it all works. I saw this movie before I read the book, and my mom, a big fan of the book loved it, so did my dad who had never read it.
Unlike a lot of period classics that are turned into films, this one has no rigidity or  boring spots, and it doesn't feel like the dime a dozen period films out there that re-use the same costumes and replay the same stories. It flows and invites you into the world of these girls, making the 1860s and the March family intensely real.Fabulous acting by an ensemble cast completes this film. Winona Ryder was inspired casting, and in my opinion makes the best screen Jo ever. She's feisty, strong, tomboyish, but has a warmth and grace about her that I feel Katharine Hepburn and June Allyson (the most famous Jo's) didn't have and suits the character wonderfully. the best thing about these characters is that they endear themselves to you, something many movies lack. Great ensemble as well: Susan Sarandon, Christian Bale, Claire Danes (at 14, believe it or not), Eric Stoltz, Kirsten Dunst, Trini Alvarado, Susan Wickes, Gabriel Byrne all of them are incredible, and fit perfectly.And if you can get through Beth's death scene without crying, you're pretty tough. It's a scene that doesn't pull sentimental melodrama, but plays honestly and goes to that heartbreaking sadness of losing someone. And the geranium petals and dolls and Thomas Newman's brilliant score finish off the scene, and I think makes it one of the greatest scenes in any film of the last 10 years (and they didn't even include it in the 75th Oscars montage, tsk tsk). The ending is incredibly lovely, and as James Lipton of the Actors Studio says, only needs those ""three words"" to coney everything that needs to be said.This is a beautiful film. It's inviting, but not overly sweet, and though nothing too exciting happens, still very fulfilling and entertaining; it can be very bittersweet, but it is a joyful film, and says a lot about people and our emotions and our lives and yet is not confrontational in the least. It pulled out themes and messages which are often looked over out of one of the world's most famous books and made a lasting work of art that touches your heart.",Little Women
70,mercybell,"""Little Women"" in it's own right",10,11 September 2002,"Though some may argue that the older classic versions of Little Women with Katherine Hepburn and June Allison may be better because it sticks to the book, this is the only version that captures the spirit of the book.Though the filmmakers took license to cut away certain specifics, the end result is an absolutely gorgeous film that stands on it's own completely. One would be able to watch this film without ever having read or known the book and seen it as it's own film.The film thrives on small scenes and nuances, moments of person to person contact, production design and cinematography, the all important score (which adds a great deal to the film). This delicate and complicated symbiosis between all aspects tactfully and poignantly creates the story, something missing from many movies these days which creates a tangible and effervescent emotional layer. Then the acting of one of the best ensembles to hit the screen in a long time. Keep an eye out for Susan Sarandon and Claire Daines in roles that ought to have been nominated along with Ryder. These actors create people that endear themselves to us, and make the film even more than it could have been.It's a small scale masterpiece that will leave you in tears. The film is honest and true in it's portrayal of human emotion. It went from being an adaptation of the book to it's own story and portrayal of people and their lives. It's beautiful aesthetically and dramatically, and a real gem of a film.",Little Women
71,sq8188-162-458059,Missed the Bar,4,30 March 2012,"Many flaws and not enough true romance. First and biggest problem is the film spends well over half of entire 123 minutes in the Concord House Where nobody had grown, or changed or learned. Then suddenly before the end, main character Josephine left for New York and young Amy went to France to ""paint""?. Much of the Concord house is old and full of dark wood and did reflect the reduced circumstance of the family, where upon their neighbors were healthy and worldly. How does that happened ? The oldest sister Meg is married off and basically had no lines for the rest of the film. That left high-spirited,tempestuous Jo to fill much of rest of the movie. Susan Sarandon, normally a high-powered actress, had nothing much to do except appeared matronly. The long-returned father was much older than everyone else and strangely had no war stories to tell, or any gifts for his daughters. Young suitor Christian Bale and Jo seemed a natural couple but inexplicably Jo rebuffed his proposal, only to meet up later with a generation-apart German professor in NYC. When Jo went to the boarding house, the book has her taking the duty of governess to the proprietress's children. There wasn't a moment's footage suggesting anything of the kind. Wynona Ryder did fine work here and some argues the 1940's version with Kate Hepburn as Jo was more spirited. It is easy to imagined that but Ryder is more attractive and therefore easier to accept, while the most memorable performance belongs really to Kirsten Dunst's young Amy, the little sis. She was perfectly puckish and adorable.",Little Women

I just watched Greta Gerwig's 2019 version and appreciated a lot of the performances and certain elements of it, yet it simply cannot hold a candle to this 1994 version. This one just has far more heart, warmth and loveliness to it - it always leaves me feeling cosy and warm inside and I always cry when Beth dies (Claire Danes is so fantastic in that scene). I just generally prefer this version in many ways: the linear storytelling, the two different Amys (which makes way more sense than these other adaptions which have one Amy), the aesthetic, the music, the performances. If you want to see a definitive adaptation of Little Women, this is it.",Little Women
74,bulletproofclod,"Loved the first part, but can't watch the second",7,21 July 2006,"The entire movie is an incredibly good and seemingly realistic story of what life was like back in the late eighteen hundreds to early nineteen hundreds. Winona Ryder as Jo is phenomenal as is the rest of the cast, apart from Samantha Mathis who I believe did not suit the role of bratty Amy as well as Kirsten Dunst did. The entire movie is captivating and mostly flawless, at least the first half or so.It does not go down hill due to acting, writing or anything else that is by the fault of the actors or director, but it is the story written as is that is a punishment. From here on out there will be spoilers. In the book there is a basic understanding as to why Lawry and Jo were not meant to be together, but all throughout this film not only do Ryder and Bale have incredibly good chemistry, but the story is believable.Jo states that they would be fighting all the time, though not once in the movie do we see a genuine argument between the two, apart from during the proposal. She is affronted when people consider Meg and Lawry to be together, and does as Amy says 'hog him'. Every action, every glance seems to be pointing to the two of them being in love, but then she flatly refuses his hand. In Louisa May Alcott's book it is made clear that she sees him as a brother and nothing else and even has aspirations for he and Meg, which is perfectly understandable. However, this film is not the book!When Lawry proposes and eventually marries Amy, it truly seems as though he is settling for anyone related to Jo and becomes involved with Amy much as Mr. Wickham does with Lydia in Pride and Prejudice. In this adaptation I cannot understand why the two do not end up together. This is a movie, a completely separated object from the book. One is not expected to read a story before watching the film, and that is the only way you can truly understand what is going through their heads.Ever since I first saw this in full, I always stop it after Meg's wedding, knowing that I have fallen in love with Lawry/Jo all over again and can't stand to watch it happen again. The character development is nearly flawless so that I can relate to the two and am upset when they do not get married.7/10, love the beginning, the last half is painful for me to watch.",Little Women
75,lionesss,Great adaptation of a classic,7,18 May 1999,"I really did enjoy this version of 'Little Women.'  It was charming, funny, sad-- everything you want it to be.  Don't recommend it if you need a quick action-fix, though. Winona Ryder was a wonderful Jo-- there are things going on in this girl's face that, seriously, can only be captured on film.  That _ugly_ line was very, um-- untrue? Kirsten Dunst was a fabulous Amy, but Samantha Mathis was too cool and insincere.  Susan Sarandon was great, but as someone else said, her lines as Marmee were just platitude after tired platitude.  Claire Danes was a sweet sad Beth (I cried!  I cried!)  Christian Bale was a hot Laurie.  Gabriel Byrne was wonderful but well his German accent was off.  (Or am I just too used to his own Irish brogue?) When I first watched the movie in the theater, I remember walking out, heartbroken, that Jo did not find Laurie to be her soulmate.  Now, though, having grown up _a little_, I totally understand her attraction to the German professor of philosophy.",Little Women
76,QueenMag,"Gorgeous Production, Excellent Adaptation",8,13 November 1998,"This film is, without a doubt, gorgeous.  Gillian Armstrong does an amazing job.  Everything is so detailed and bright and colorful.  There are wonderful moments when the camera does a close-up shot of a pair of hands shaking sugar powder over a cake ... or of red rose petals being spread over a row of worn dolls.  These are very little, but memorable moments.I've read the Little Women series several times - before and after seeing this movie.  I've also seen two other film versions; this one is really a superb adaptation of Little Women and Good Wives.  It's also modernized (and pretty much de-Christianized) but in keeping with the original sentiment of the novels.This is one of those movies that I watch and ... as the minutes pass I dread arriving at the conclusion.  I just want it to go on and on.Kirsten Dunst, Susan Sarandon and Christian Bale are really the stand outs in this picture.  Christian Bale is the absolute best Laurie imaginable. His proposal scene to Jo (""I'll let you win every argument"") is great.  Kirsten Dunst is perfect as the spoiled, self-absorbed (but still sweet and lovable) youngest March sister. Every time I see this movie I want Susan Sarandon to be MY mother.  She is just like Marmee in the book.Winona Ryder as Jo is, of course, the central character - and she plays her well, but I found it a little hard to accept her because she is nothing like the Jo in the book.  I mean, Jo wasn't really supposed to be so pretty and petite as Winona Ryder.  One of the reasons Jo is such an enduring and beloved character is the very fact that she WAS an ordinary-looking girl - but she had an extraordinary spirit.  Thousands upon thousands of girls could relate to her.By casting Winona Ryder it felt silly to hear her say things like ""I'm ugly.""  If she was supposed to be ugly, what about the rest of us?  Well, in any case, I can forgive that because Ryder really does do a good job and the rest of the casting (except for the somewhat distant Samantha Mathis) was right-on.All in all, the movie is great family entertainment. It's a nice portrayal of old-fashioned feminism, and the bonds of family (especially sisterhood). Maybe it won't strike such a strong chord with the male sector but I haven't met a woman yet who didn't love it.",Little Women

It's a brilliantly portrayed coming-of-age story of four sisters, free-spirited Jo, charming Meg, shy Beth and dramatic Amy. Each girl is unique in their own way and their journey through life is beautifully told through a beautifully written screenplay. The performances, particularly those of the wonderfully spirited Winona Ryder and the adorable Christian Bale, are nothing short of stunning and I found a great joy in watching the sisters with their Pickwick meetings, much so that my friends and I have enjoyed our time making Pickwick meetings of our own. The costumes and set design are beautifully authentic and as a Canadian, I find much familiarity in the film as to how much it reminds me of Prince Edward Island's devotion to Anne of Green Gables. There's a little something for everyone in this story as it can be funny, sad, sweet, bitter, and above all rather touching. It's a true masterpiece that Alcott would have been proud of.",Little Women

I wanted to see it because I was told of how much of a romantic fairy tale it was. I was pleased with it, although....What was with the whole beard thingy that ""Teddy"" grew in the end? And why did he have to marry Amy? It's like he was only using her to be part of the family, because he truely was in love with Jo.The beginning of the movie was fantasticly created with all the old-fashioned dresses and such a tight family bond. Everything was great until they used a different Amy March. I know they had to, but I don't think the actress fullfilled her duties as Amy March. Don't get me wrong, she's a great actress, one of my favorites. But she just didn't fit it as Amy.As the movie progressed, it began to get unsatisfactory. Everything just sort of zoomed by, and I thought it wrong to have Laurie and Amy marry. And I also thought it wrong for Amy to go to Paris. It just didn't click.Claire Danes gave a spectacular performance, as did all the ""little women"".

Regarding the movie now, the cast is amazing, I like 90's movies feel and directing and it was interesting to see young Christian Bale, Wynona Ryder and Kirsten Dust. I certainly liked the ""warmth"" this movie emits, as well the leading performances. However, the plot seemed a little bit boring and disconnected to me.

Gillian Armstrong does such an amazing job at directing, and Colleen Atwood's costume design is exquisite (very true to the individual characters and the time period in America of that time).The actors are also perfectly cast in their roles! Winona Ryder is a real standout as Jo, likewise Kirsten Dunst really embodies Amy (at age 12) in the start of the film. Even Trini Alvarado and Claire Danes are excellent in the roles of Meg and Beth March. Plus, Samantha Mathis even embodies young adult Amy March well, in the second half of the film, with her mature, debutante presence.Even though some people criticized some of the anachronistic aspects of the film, I personally liked the cute scene of Jo, Beth, and Amy playing in the snow with Laurie, since I felt that it really brought a lot of life in the film. Plus while Susan Sarandon's Marmee may have been slightly different from the other versions of said character (if not a bit too liberal for the Victorian era), she still embodied the kind motherly spirit that Marmee always had.",Little Women

The relationships between the March family and the people who come into their lives are convincing and real. If I were to have any qualms about this movie it would probably be that it didn't feel clear to me which character Samantha Mathis was playing until later when I had realised she was indeed an older Amy. The casting choice was perhaps the problem, four years later in the storyline Amy would have been a lady of society so about sixteen but she looks the same age as Jo. I later found out that Samantha Mathis is actually much older than is implied of her character, in fact much older than Winona and Claire and that makes it confusing and makes it hard to believe she is supposed to be Amy.",Little Women

However, Little Women isn't all light and joyful, it is emotionally sad as well, when Beth (Claire Danes) died I admit I cried, It was so emotional and sad that she didn't have the chance of a life. I love the romance between Jo (Winona Ryder) and Friedrich (Gabriel Byrne), and I wish I was Jo as he is gorgeous, loving and seems to understand Jo and he is romantic! My favourite scenes are when Jo and Friedrich go to the opera and he translates it for Jo, and you see his deep feelings for Jo.

The story of the March family living amidst the Civil War is one of my favorites ever. The characters don't seem made up at all, instead they become part of your family and part of your life.  That is why, the performances of Winona Ryder, Claire Danes, Kristen Dunst, and Christian Bale was so moving. This group of talented young actors brought to life the lives of Jo, Amy, Beth, and Laurie.  They do such a convincing job playing these characters that, Ryder is no longer Ryder, instead you see her as the real Jo.  Claire Danes performance as Beth was so hauntingly beautiful.

Susan Sarandon plays the saintly matriarch and keeps together the kind of family that you would gladly die for. Trini Alvarado, Claire Danes and Kirsten Dunst are admirable as Meg,Beth and Amy - Alvarado in particular giving grace and elegance to the responsible Meg. The score alone should be praised to high heaven because it's as beautiful and heart-warming as the film itself, Thomas Newman's 'Orchard House' is like listening to a brass band in a shopping mall at Christmas! A wonderful treat for the ears! Christian Bale was a good choice as the loyal but secretly lovesick Laurie. Gabriel Byrne is dignity personified as Professor Bhaer who proves the suitable match for Jo who is forever searching for something extraordinary - helpful to hopeless romantics when she eventually finds it in the very last scene.

90,BlurryWitch,Comparing the 1994 and the 2019 versions,9,9 November 2021,"I haven't read the book, nor have I seen the previous adaptations. I watched the 2019 version last night, and immediately after, Amazon Prime suggested this 1994 version, which I watched too. So I got to compare those two.I like this 1994 version better overall.I like that the story is told in a linear way, which makes it much easier to understand and adds more suspense (will Beth die?! Will Jo and Laurie be together?!).The cast is chosen better in the 1994 version. In this version, Christian Bale is a credible Laurie, while in the 2019 version the actor looks too young and not masculine enough. Gabriel Byrne is a great Professor Bhaer. In the 2019 version I didn't quite understand why Jo fell in love with him. In this 1994 version, I totally get it. Amy's jealousy and the drama between her and Jo also make more sense with a much younger Amy, as she is in the 1994 version. That bit didn't make much sense to me in the 2019 version.In this 1994 version, it's not so clear to me why Jo refuses Laurie. In the 2019 version, it's explained that she doesn't love him romantically, and sees him more like a brother. In the 1994 version, she only says they would be fighting all the time, which is unbelievable since we never see them fighting. They seem to get along great and she acts like she is in love with him the whole time. It doesn't make much sense.There are some little things that disturb me in this 1994 version. The kisses made me cringe. Such anachronism!Amy's personality seems to change so awfully much when she grows up. It's like she's a different person. Yes, it's a different actress, but the character's personality just changes too much.The Beth/Mr. Lawrence subplot and Meg's struggle to accept poverty are missing from the 1994 version. I liked that about the 2019 version.About both movies, it feels like me like they were made by people who read the book for people who read the book. We're supposed to just know, accept or understand certain things because they're in the book, even though they're not so clear based on the screenplay.",Little Women

92,missnavymoo2,The Truest and Best of the Bunch,8,2 January 2010,"In 1933, Katharine Hepburn portrayed Josephine ""Jo"" March in ""Little Women."" The picture was re-made in the 1950s with June Allyson as Jo. Then in 1994, the best of the 3, starring Winona Ryder as Jo, came to the screen. This version, which is true to the book, is lush, realistic, tender and just plain,old-fashioned wonderful. I LOVE this movie! It may be said that the sign of a truly great actress is how far and how deeply she dives into and becomes her character. In real life, Susan Sarandon is a liberal, political activist as well as a mother and the (newly separated) partner of actor Tim Robbins. But in this movie, she is a warm, maternal, kind-hearted, wise mother of four different daughters. While hints and sometimes downright statements of feminism - are peppered throughout the movie, Ms. Sarandon maintains her identity as ""Marmee"" very convincingly. But the wonder of the movie is the performance by Winona Ryder. Of all the actresses whoever portrayed Jo, Ms. Ryder is perhaps the most convincing. Her scenes with Laurie (played so well by Christian Bale) and later, Professor Bhaer (played by a personal favorite, Gabriel Byrne), are marvelous. A childhood love becomes a deep friendship with Laurie. And a real, maturing passion develops between her and her professor. The last scene --- oh, I still cry when I see it, is so good (and I won't be a spoiler). I recommend this film most highly. My only complaint is that, while Jo, Meg and Beth were played by the same actress, Amy is played by two different actresses. The March girls were all children in the beginning and they became women as the novel progresses; why didn't they have younger actresses for the parts of Jo and Meg especially? It was nice to see a couple of real veterans besides Ms. Sarandon. John Neville as Mr. Laurence was, as always, brilliant though the part was small. And Mary Wicks - I remember her from ""Now, Voyager""! This movie has aired quite often on cable. If you've not seen it, then by all means, do so. And, oh, yes, the music is also lush and beautiful RUN, don't walk, to buy the DVD. You'll be prompted to read the book again. Always a delight!",Little Women

Winona Ryder shines as Jo, Trini Alvarado is demure and beautiful as Meg, Claire Danes breaks your heart as Beth while Kirsten Dunst is a star in her own right as mischievous Amy. Susan Sarandon makes us all wish she was our mother with her heartwarming portrayal of Marmee.From sisterly fights as girls to family bonds as women, this movie will make you laugh, cry and every other cliché in the world. The girls will touch your hearts as they overcome family trials, broken hearts and the difficulty of growing up poor amongst the backdrop of the Civil war. It's wonderfully written with amazing cinematography and beautiful direction. The girls share great chemistry that makes their on-screen relationship as sisters believable.While fans of the novel may be disappointed by the changes made to some of the characters and situations overall the movie brings the core values and emotions from the book to the screen.

I'm torn, I do not want to rate it purely as a comparison but having been so familiar with the second version I can't entirely help it. Being honest with myself, were this the first time I was watching ""Little Women"" and this was the first version to be introduced to it I'd have stopped watching or completely lost interest. It was choppy, the acting didn't carry through all too well and it just seemed to be trying too hard to stick to a novel. Because of this I suspect it may be closer in accuracy to the novel than the '49 version. For that reason I am now interested in reading the novel that much more. Ryder did not play as strong a Jo as I found June Allyson did. Claire Danes was not a very warm and loving Beth nor was she very memorable a character as the '49 carried.

I guess this is one of those films that keep the cruel world outside and is at least for me above all criticism (there are some of these and I won't listen any objections). I still think that Jo should take Laurie and still hate Amy. And the winter scenery is still the best I've seen on film (living over half of the year surrounded by snow this always catches my eyes).Even though the whole plot is very over romantic this adaptation made in the 1990's has also some more modern ways of thinking pulling through. (Jo's fight between her ambitions and family).The cast (especially Winona Ryder, in her surprisingly best role to this day) is great and the director gives all main characters space to breath and evolve without losing the thread.

Nice under-playing by Susan Sarandon, and it's great to see Mary Wickes still going strong.  But the fact is that George Cukor did it best of all back in 1933.

Amys sniping at Laurie in the gardens lacks so much compared with her clever criticism seen in the book. I do not normally witter when films are not exact replications of the book, really who can expect that? However I do believe they ought bring the characters to life not modernise them as if they fear the audience will become bored when Jo and the prof do not instantly leap into bed.

I first saw it as a child (after having loved the 1949 version) and this film completely opened up the world of the March sisters for me. Not to knock the previous two big screen adaptations, but they don't come close to conveying the happiness, heartbreak, and nostalgia that Little Women of 1994 does. What is so refreshing about this film is the truth and realism of the book. The actresses don't wear makeup, they don't speak in melodramatic tones; the men aren't playboys or Rhett Butlers. The writing and acting feels natural and true to Alcott's novel - which makes the sisters' victories and losses all the more authentic to the viewer. This is a wonderful movie to watch with your family to teach them values of love, friendship, and loyalty.",Little Women
103,crow_jane,A journey to adulthood,9,3 February 2005,"I watched Little Women last night and for the first time in a very long time I viewed it as a film in it's own right, without being preoccupied with comparing it to the book. The first thing that struck me was the music. It makes one think of childhood, and I guess, for me, that is partly because the movie was released when I was a child. But it is beautifully melancholy score, evoking the nostalgia that is the true meaning behind this film. Jo is the main character, and the movie is truly the story of her growing up. When we first meet her she is an ambitious young writer, ""longing for transformation"", to escape the confines of her family life. But at the same time Jo loves her family deeply, hence a conflict that rages in her for the better part of the movie, best shown in the scene where Mr. March has arrived home and Jo is sitting on the stairs watching the family, cut off from them by her fear of change, namely Meg marrying and leaving the family home, and in the scene where Jo explains to Marmee how trapped she feels. Meg and Amy are both desperate to grow up and leave home, but once they do, they feel closer bound to their family then ever; Amy brings back from Europe a painting of the family home. Beth never has this conflict - since neither desire nor ambition drive her from home and, in fact, she never actually grows up. Laurie is the love of Jo's childhood, Friedrich of her adulthood. Hence, on the cusp of adulthood, Jo rejects Laurie even though she loves him, rightly divining that they would live to regret marrying each other. In fact, Jo rejects her childish loves - Laurie and travel and family, in pursuit of an adult identity. Meg's journey is one from false dignity, a misguided idea of what is 'proper' and 'grown-up', to embracing true maturity. The girls do their best in a world not made for women's betterment. Jo:""I'd commit murder to go to college"" Armstrong infuses the movie with more pro-feminist feeling than Alcott did in the book, but this seems to lead to the sad diminishing of the characters of Mr. March and Mr. Lawrence as if the title Little Women means the only characters that could possibly be of importance are the women and their love interests (yes, I'm back to referencing the book) The acting is good (except Samantha Mathis, who brings none of the life and sparkle to Amy that Dunst does) , the design beautiful, the directing faultless. All in all, a wonderful movie.",Little Women

107,vrlayer,A Let Down!,2,2 August 2019,"In the beginning of the movie, it was exciting and educational about what was going on in the world outside of the March Family. All the sisters seem to have each others backs, even though they fought often. The movie is extremely long and the acting is very good, but the story-line was a complete let down.It started out with Jo being dedicated to her writing and set on the fact that she was to be seen as an independent woman. With her sisters by her side, entertaining her theatrical outburst. Then Laurie came into play and there was chemistry, which if you ask me there was more chemistry between Peter Lawford and June Allison in the original.But, even in the original the ending and middle of the movie was a let down. I didn't like that Jo's character was harshing criticized by the professor and she allows it. I wish she would have accepted Laurie's hand the second time instead of being stubborn. Even worse than that though, I hated how Laurie and Amy ended up together when Laurie is in love with Jo and Amy is her sister!!Just not a happy ending at all!",Little Women

I have shown this masterpiece to almost every one of my friends and they all have loved it, even the ones who don't usually watch drama. Winona Ryder makes her best performance in this one (although she is veeery cute in Reality Bites) and you wonder why she didn't get awarded for this one. If you think dramas can be slow or just boring, watch this movie and you'll be surprised how this one can change your life but be warned that you might fall in love with Winona and can't stop until you have watched every single movie she has made :)",Little Women

I thought it stuck nicely to the spirit of the books - even the Women's Suffrage lectures that I don't remember reading in the original Alcott fit nicely into Alcott's own tendency to pedagogy.  :)All the actors were lovely - although I would have liked a bit more from the girl who played the older Amy and there were times that the girl who played Beth kind of annoyed me.I would have liked to see more emphasis on the Beth/Mr. Laurence story near the beginning, which they pretty much all but ignored.  I was also a little disappointed in the way the whole Amy/Laurie/Jo/Professor Bhaer thing was done, which took out some of the charm of the original book.  They tried to make it too much of a soap opera, and the innocent charm of the Jo/Professor Bhaer thing definitely suffered.  (That said, I did enjoy the guy who played Bhaer... I've never much liked him in the books, but here I actually sort of liked him.)Is there no movie version that will dramatize the dance at Nice?I had something else of vital importance to say, but I have forgotten it.

When they started showing the trailer for the 2019 remake of this I was really looking forward to it, but it was a total disappointment. If anything, it showed me how on point this version is. All the characters really match the age they should be and make the story come to life. In the newer version all the characters are mismatched in age and how they evolve and demonstrate who they are that it just makes me realize how much more amazing this version is. If I could give it more stars I would, but they limit me to 10. I know I love a movie when I rewatch it many times, and I have watched this more times that I can remember. In watching the 2019 version I just kept noticing the things that were off point through the whole movie. It was a struggle to get through it.

It is one of very few movies where you actually care about the characters and the choices they make.  You follow them through their lives and what they lose, you lose.  What they gain, you gain.

It may come as a surprise, but the art of simple but beautiful story-telling in this version of the classic book is hard to top. There is nothing abstract or metaphorical about the direction of the film but it still captures the sense of reality and morals that were so pivotal during that time period and really shows you how much of that lacks today. I may only be saying this because i am stickler for period pieces. The performances, especially those of Winona Ryder (who was nominated for an Oscar and should have won) and Claire Danes were incredibly moving and played with such understanding to their respective characters. Christian Bale was the perfect choice for Teddy's character. I don't want to include any spoilers because that will just ruin the whole experience of the film. Its a superb masterpiece that cannot be missed.",Little Women

There is however, a major problem with it: Jo doesn't marry Laurie! What was Louisa May Alcott thinking?? Am I the only one who thinks that the old, German professor was completely wrong for Jo? And Amy gets Laurie! How absurd. The first half of the movie is just magic. I have to agree with Jo. Why do they have to grow up? Can't the story just be about their fun times as ""little women""? The acting is superb for the most part. Winona Ryder was perfect for the part of Jo March and Christian Bale made a more than perfect Laurie. Kirsten Dunst did a great job playing the part of young Amy, although she was a little too likable. Samantha Mathis on the other hand didn't do a very good job at all playing older Amy March. As I said, the story should have ended with them in their younger years. I guess I love and hate this movie.",Little Women

123,LeadingLadybug,Heartwarming and true to the book,10,12 February 2006,"""Little Women"" is a gem of a movie, encompassing comedy, drama, and romance into one well-made film that is true to Louisa May Alcott's literary classic. It follows the lives of the four March sisters, from the turbulence of youth, the turmoil and romance of adolescence, the joy of love, and the pain of loss. The quality of this movie depends entirely upon the chemistry between the actors, and it accomplished this with success. The film is a vignette of scenes throughout the sisters' lives, showing their relationships with one another and with the people around them.Winona Ryder is the quintessential Jo, the tomboyish, spirited sister who dreams of becoming an accomplished writer. She brings a refreshingly sweet, human touch to the character, who is as impulsive and headstrong as she is ambitious and loving. Ryder carried the film beautifully, and much of its success is due to her.Trini Alvarado made a very pretty and convincing Meg, the dependable older sister, although she is not so set on marrying for money as she is in the book. Claire Danes as sweet, selfless Beth, really shone in one heartbreaking scene that is impossible not to cry through. For her performance as the spoiled youngest sister, Amy, the very young Kirsten Dunst showed remarkable potential, and brought humor to the character.Christian Bale as Laurie was everything the ""boy next door"" should be: handsome, kind, and charming. His chemistry with Winona Ryder was considerable, and made their friendship very believable. Susan Sarandon played a wonderful Marmee, supportive and loving towards her girls.Another thing I would recommend is the soundtrack to this movie, composed by Thomas Newman, which has some gorgeous music on it.10/10",Little Women

Winona Ryder had a lot to live up to taking a role that was previously played by Katherine Hepburn and June Alyson (In a 1949 musical spin off). A movie that truly captures the spirit of American girls as they grow up and discover themselves and their strength.  In Little Women the March sisters: Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy move through their lives in post Civil War Concord to coming out parties, New York City, Europe, marriage, and the great hereafter. Great performances by all involved including Susan Sarandon as Marmee, Christian Bale as Teddy, and Gabriel Byrne as Professeur Bahr.

128,javajk-javajk,Deeply annoying distortion of the novel.,1,3 June 2004,"This version of ""Little Women"" ranks right DOWN there with the most recent remake of ""A Little Princess"" for its deeply annoying distortion of the novel. Three examples: Contemporary feminist ideas that hold little in common with Alcott's ""feminism"" turn the character of ""Marmee"" (Sarandon) into a plastic caricature of the original. John Brooke is turned into a pert cartoon of a 1950's ""beatnik"", both in physical appearance and in his speech mannerisms. Professor Bhaer (impossible here to consider in his early 40's, as in the text) makes a mild sexual ""pass"" at Jo in the theatre which is fully at odds with his abstemious, classical German temperament. .. .

I can't resist costume dramas. All that having been said, is it any surprise that I love this movie? I enjoyed this movie more than all the other adaptations. It has depth that the others lack. It does not play the novel out scene by scene or have the cast reciting big chunks of the book itself. You are drawn into the very lively world of young women as the grow up. You cheer for them, and cry with them.All the characters are very well played. Here, the biggest, and best surprise is how fully realized male characters are. Laurie gets his due as a fifth lead, and John Brook steps out of the background to become someone the audience really likes.This film works as well as a film as it does as a story.

130,DwarvesAreVeryUpsetting,The ultimate Christmas movie,10,24 December 2017,"This is a gorgeous, highly sensitive adaptation of Little Women. Nobody is going to mistake this for a chick flick. This version has an undercurrent of sadness which was always there in the novel. All of the actors deliver very solid work, but the film really belongs to Claire Danes, who handles by far the most challenging role in the story. She is so present and dropped in that it is impossible to believe that she's a 15-year-old with hardly any acting experience. Beth is the girl who nobody pays much attention to, and for most of her life she doesn't seem to mind that much. She is a simple soul who finds joy in small things.... her sense of purpose comes from being there for her sisters. But when they all grow up and get married, they no longer need her in the way they used to. With nothing to do but sit around the house all day, she loses her will to live. Claire gives a luminous, absolutely heartbreaking performance as the sister who ends up getting left behind by everyone in the end.",Little Women

133,beanie-6,Brilliant,10,8 July 1999,wow!! to sum it up. However i feel that it is the performances by all the actors and actresses that deserve most of the credit.  Being a great fan of Winona Ryder i bought the video to see her mainly but it surprisingly i did not feel that she was the best out of all of them but rather Claire Danes as poor Beth who almost made me shed a tear.  Even though she did not have a great part i felt that she played it perfectly and successfully stirred up my emotions.  The ending is the usual happy ending but i felt that the loss of Beth still remained in your heart by the end which was unusual for a film.  credit must be given to everyone but i feel especially Winona Ryder and Claire Danes.  This film is well worth seeing.,Little Women

I said to one of the trainers how my wife and I had been looking for a cat. She had one, she had ""starred"" as a kitten in Little Women but hadn't done much else since. So we adopted her. A year later, thinking (somewhat erroneously, if you know cats, you'll know what I mean) that she might like company, a feline companion, I again happened to be on the set of the Leslie Nielson comedy Wrongfully Accused, and there was the same animal trainer, this time with an eagle, I think. ANyway, did she have any more cats for adoption. Yep, she brought in two Polaroids. Unfortunately they were brothers, and we only wanted one more cat. We chose the one with crazed eyes and lots of attitude. It turned out that he, too, was one of the kittens in Little Women! I have a screen capture shot of the two of them being held by Winona Ryder.

136,issyruth,"A must see tale of growing up, following your dreams and unconditional love",10,11 December 2006,"Little women was set in the 1800's. It is the tale of four sisters who are all very different. Meg the eldest, wants to get married and settle down. The second eldest Jo, is a bit of a tom boy and defying all the grounds of traditional life in those days she wants to become a writer and decides to chase her dream. Then there's Beth, she is kind hearted and shy, she wants to help everyone in need and always listens. The youngest Amy wants to grow up too fast and argues with Jo (partly due to Jo's feisty and impatience personality). The story is mainly based on how Jo sees things, however all characters are shown equally which gives us a feeling of the real diversity between them. All of the girls bicker like most sisters do, but when their father goes to war and they are forced to live a less well off life, they realise that they must all make sacrifices.There are many men in this film who love the sisters and throughout we are given a sense of continuous friendship as well as love. Teddy is very important to the tale as he helps Jo to grow up and become more aware of life. Although this tale is one which seems on the surface to be one of family life, it deals with love, loss and growing up. Throughout this film the audience is left with a sense of innocence about the world and hope that innocence still exists. In modern day films we aren't often able to watch a film without there being explicit or violent content, so this is perhaps a much wanted refreshing look on life.This film, even twelve years later, is still regarded by young audiences as a good watch as it is entertaining, funny, enjoyable and sad. It is definitely an American classic.",Little Women

The book is a true ""timeless classic"" and the movie would have worn better had the director stayed true to the book. Kirsten Dunst and Christian Bales are wonderful in their parts. I enjoyed seeing Orchard House however the interior looked Victorian. Descriptions of the decorating done by the Alcott parents are described as light colors, open and simple. The outdoor photography was lovely and the costumes seemed right. The characters were not well rounded and my husband and I laughed out loud at several of Marmee's lines.

It's interesting watching it again and being able to appreciate fully the vivid characters and relationships and fabulous screen play. Now I'm 22 and relate to the girls from a new perspective but with just as much empathy and adoration. I'm so glad i sought this film out again. A lovely, heartwarming film for all the family with great acting by some of today's leading names. Only criticism is that I found the ending a little abrupt but overall, much enjoyed.",Little Women

All these actors were great in this movie. I think it was hard making this movie because most of the movies what are books retold in to movie are very hard to make and they are usually bad like when I saw Little Women I was like well look at the next bad movie in the world but then I watched it and I loved it I told all my friends about it and they liked it too. HERE IS THE STORY LINE: Spirted Jo loves writing stories and usually Meg, Beth, Amy and Jo loves acting them out. Jo's ambition is to be a author so she moves to New York to show her books to the (I do not know what this is called but i think it is this Person who decides if the book should be published) then he says thatsheshould not make fairy tales and girly stories and he says to write about what she knows so that is what she does at the end. Meg (Trini Alvarado) is the eldest girl who is beautiful. She has long pretty dark hair with a magnificent pale face. She goes to all the parties like you see her in the dressing room of Belle Gradener's party. She get married to John Brookes played by Eric Stoltz. Fragile Beth March (Claire Danes) wants to be just like her big sister Jo she tries to write stories but can not exceed. She is a shy 15 year old who then gets scarlet fever and dies. Amy ( Kirsten Dunst Samantha Mathis play the young and old amy and the older Amy marries Larrie (Christian Bale). I loved this movie and I think gillian Armstrong (director) put this movie together very well. I thought Winona Ryder made this movie special playing jo and Claire Danes did as well playing Beth.

140,sadia89,All good - except for grown-up Amy SPOILER,10,27 December 2005,"Little Women (1994) is one of my favourite movies ever. It has a star-studded cast including Winona Ryder, Christian Bale, Kirsten Dunst, Claire Danes and Susan Sarrandon. Although I'm not sure of the name of the actress that plays Meg, the oldest sister; it is clear that she too is a great actress.When, however, the film goes further into the future of the girls' lives, the actress that plays Amy quite ruins a fantastic film. The brilliance of everyone else, however, manages to save the film from calamity.Christian Bale, as Laurie, a very close friend to the March family is fantastic and the Professor Baer (I think his name is), is great too, but I think that Laurie and Jo should have ended up together.Anyhow, this film is still fantastic, and even though I am a great fan of literature and spend most of my time reading, I found the film to be much better than the book (this rarely happens).Also, don't be put off by any earlier Little Women films made; this one tops them all.",Little Women
141,lwbing00,A total downgrade from the 1933 release,4,15 June 2007,"This modern remake of Little Women is simply no match to the 1934 classic. Winona Ryder was pale, uninspiring and unnatural compared to Katharine Hepburn. It is utterly beyond me how Ryder was nominated for an Oscar for her role while Hepburn was not. Maybe this just shows how much movie-acting has degenerated -- after all, the year Ms. Ryder was nominated was the year of Forrest Gump. The four girls in this contemporary version appeared mostly chubby and mellow and looked perfectly like the middle class offsprings from a suburban family of the '90s. They even spoke the accent of the 90s! Except for the music score, it is very hard to identify any part on which the new film improved upon the old one. The supporting roles, played brilliantly by the likes of Edna May Oliver (aunt) and Henry Stephenson (Mr. Laurence) in the old version, were mostly succeeded by bland and uninteresting performances.",Little Women
142,misssophea,"Great adaptation, but for...",8,6 November 2005,"Gillian Armstrong did a great job adapting this classic novel. Of course there always is that delicate task of sorting out what to put on screen and what to leave aside. Overall, the choices were good, but most importantly, she kept the spirit of the novel, this attaching and unique spirit. The characters are brilliantly acted, especially in the first part of the movie. Now my only regret is the insipid performance of Samantha Mathis as grown-up Amy, which terribly contrasts with the lively young Kirsten Dunst. Here Mathis fails completely to show that Amy turned into a fine lady not only in appearance but also INSIDE. Another thing is how Laurie goes from Jo to Amy without real transition, when there is one in the book. This quick change of heart is a bit misleading in the perception of Laurie's character. Other than that, one of my favorite movies, not to mention the absolutely great soundtrack by Thomas Newman, which perfectly fits the movie!",Little Women
143,mkultra76,Dreadful version,3,16 January 2006,"The only reason this dreadful version of a much loved book even garnered a four from me is because the scenery itself was beautiful, and the actual Orchard House where the Alcotts lived was incorporated into the filming.This in no way touches on the depth of character from Louisa May Alcott's book, in fact it's so bad that when certain important events occur...don't want to give anything away here concerning the plot...one is left wondering why they should care. The acting itself was wooden--Winona Ryder makes a horrible Jo, and Claire Danes as Beth was truly pitiful--the script did not flow or introduce any of the wonderful aspects of character that was found in the book, or the movie version starring Margaret O'Brien, Elizabeth Taylor, and June Allyson. Watching this film, one does not know that Meg pines away for riches because the family used to be wealthy, and she has never forgotten having the ""little luxuries."" One does not know that Beth spent a great deal of her time next door at the Lawrence's and was such a beautiful piano player. They don't even introduce the fact that Amy is ""ashamed"" of her nose, which was most amusing. And Jo, it's miserable the way they butchered her character. Instead of holding her head high above her sorrows and troubles, this film portrayed her as a ""oh-woe-is-me"" type of character who just felt sorry for herself.Please don't waste your time on this. If you wish to see Little Women in film, rent or buy a different version. The version with June Allyson was infinitely better than this one. Or better yet, spend some time and read the book.",Little Women
144,yenerowitz,all time favorite,10,16 August 2005,I had to give this one a 10 rating. It is the best film of all time. I really love this one. It is extremely well casted. All the young actresses and actors are now megastars. All the colours are great the costumes and the lights and production designs. The PD is a dutchman!!! I listened to the directors commentary and I really learned that this was a project in which the makers put their hearts in. This film is all heart.Warm!To some people it may be a bit to sugarcoated. If you are a macho don't watch it. The rest of you .....don't miss it.If there are 10 things you have to do before you die reading the book and watching the film must be on that list.The title LITTLE WOMEN is nice but gives you the wrong idea. It's not just for little girls.,Little Women
